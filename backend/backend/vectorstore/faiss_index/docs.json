I'm not into black cat strategies I'm not into whatever some of my, some of my techniques take a little bit longer. But guys, we're building assets we're building something yes you know that content is going to take you a couple hours to write.  But that content is going to produce you lead after lead after lead after lead and once you rank those leads are free dude they don't cost you additional money everything doesn't cost you money they're free leads once they come in organically.  So, the way I look at it is the content might take me two hours of my time and my time is valuable, right or two hours and I had to pay somebody 50 bucks an hour or 20 bucks an hour.  And once I get, you know, 20 leads in five in five months or whatever seven months that spend a $50 or $100 was paid for 100 times over right because I was able to bring the ads down.",

    "pageContent": " Nick says, one more question on my end. Do you still go into city niche combo that looks like  the lowest hanging fruit, but nobody's paying for ads at my stage? Yes, I will. If it's low  hanging fruit. Okay. If you don't have enough money where the bills are paid and some move on.  Okay. Where I'm at right now, it's like, if I see it, like, for example, I remember seeing,  I was doing research and I saw this window tinting, don't love the niche, but I had a feeling  that I would be able to sell it because it was local to where I'm at. And it's so low hanging  guys. It was like the stupidest thing ever. And I was like, I don't even know if I want to do this,  but it was so low hanging. I'm like, I have to do it. We put up a website. I did zero SEO. I'm  talking zero, not a backlink, not nothing. And the site ranked. Okay. So if I see those opportunities,  I'll build them because it literally sometimes can be 45, 60 days. Those suckers are ranking,  which by the way, in these last modules, we're going to be releasing, you guys are going to  learn those strategies. You can start implementing those so that you can get those sites ranked.  But where I'm at now, yes. But as far as like for you, I probably wouldn't recommend it until  you get to a certain level. Okay. Now those are, I'm talking, those, what I'm just to clarify,  I'm talking specifically about city niche combinations where I'm okay. If I let that  thing just rank and I don't touch it for six months or three months or two months,  if you're talking about, do you go into a city niche combination, but you need to pre-sell it  type of a thing? Probably not, dude. Probably not. Like if there's not people paying for ads,  there's just too many people willing to pay for ads for me to dick around to that kind of stuff.  Okay. So that's just my personal preference. Can you still sell people that aren't paying for ads?  Of course. Of course you can. Okay. Of course you can, but it's just, it's like, why, why,  why make it harder on ourselves than we have to?",

    "pageContent": " Okay guys, officially welcome to today's call, it's February 11th, 7 a.m. and today we're  going to be talking about closing on the first call.  Really really quick though guys, just a couple things I want to cover.  First of all, if you're not in the Rank and Rent Academy, if you are in this group, you  have free lifetime access as long as you're of course a member of this group, you get  access to the Rank and Rent Academy.  There's nothing in there that you're not going to get in here, this is where you should spend  your time.  However, I will tell you that there's some people I can see right now that are on this  slide that are taking advantage of the things in that group.  Every single Monday at 7 a.m. I go live and I do a Q&A.  Every single Monday.  Now, I will tell you there are things that I refuse to cover in that group because those  people, the ones that are not in this group have not paid for that knowledge.  For example, yesterday we had somebody ask a question about ads and I told them, hey,  you want to learn ads?  You got to pay the piper, you got to pay me, who's paid the piper?  So I'm not going to cover ads.  But there's a lot of other stuff that we cover and so if you guys have questions, you guys  want more FaceTime with me, you guys have paid to be here and so you get access to that.  It's funny, that call is actually dominated by Digital Landlord students so it's amazing.  It makes me happy because I'm able to help you guys from this group inside of that group  as well.  Okay, so that said guys, that is every single Monday at 7 a.m.  If you do not have access to the RankinRent Academy, message, not Francesca, message Ashley,  she'll get you access.  Okay?  A couple quick things about the RankinRent Engine tool.  First and foremost, if you don't know what that is, go to RankinRentEngine.com, it is  the only tool that you need for this business.  You do not, number one, you do not need any tools to make money.  Okay?  Just going to say that out front, you do not need any tools to make money.  I was able to cobble about eight different tools together and I was able to make my money.  But it was a pain.  I spent a lot of time, I spent a lot of effort, I actually spent a lot of money trying to  figure it out.  But I want you guys to know this is not something that you have to do.  It does make things a lot easier.  Doing due diligence.  I was talking to somebody yesterday that was doing, that is in RankinRent Engine.  They're like, yeah, I've already looked at 50 cities, 50 cities, you know how long it  takes to look at 50 cities?  It takes about 30 minutes.  When you first start, probably takes an hour.  But let's say you get good at it, it takes 30 minutes, 30 minutes times 50, do the math.  That's how long it takes to do 50.  This guy just busted them out, okay?  But on the business of Rare, a couple things that you should know.  Number one is there, if you go in, you log in, there is a user metrics dashboard that  is now live.  You can see your progress.  You can see your, you know, did my revenue increase, decrease, clients, all this different",

    "pageContent": " stuff.  It is, it's a great like snapshot of your business.  So that's live.  That is a new feature or a new view that we've added.  Also, I've said this a few times with the backlink analyzer 1.0 is live.  When I say 1.0, we are going to be beefing that up.  We're going to be looking at that for, we're going to be able to, we're going to allow  you guys to be able to look at the backlinks of your competitors from different views,  not just the root domain.  But for now, you can go and you can jam in the root domain of any of your competitors  or any website at all.  And you can go and take a look at the backlinks, okay?  So the backlink analyzer 1.0 is live.  And then one other cool thing, we're trying to keep everything into one place to make  it as easy as possible.  So you guys can have your, your browser open, you have rank and rent engine, you have Google,  you know, you're doing some, some searching on different cities and, and that's it.  You don't have to have a million different softwares open that are all talking.  We're also adding the, the lead value calculator inside of rank and rent engine.  Now I, for those of you that were on yesterday on the rank and rent Academy call, I thought  it was completely live.  We've just sent it into production.  So within the next week or two, that will be live.  Okay.  Anyway, just want to give you guys some updates on that.  It's exciting.  We're making changes.  We're moving.  And anybody that has any recommendations, anything they'd like to see done to that tool,  please email me.  My, my email is nick at digital landlords.com.  You guys can send me an email, send me a, Hey, I would like to see this done.  I'd like to see it do this.  Like for example, we had somebody yesterday from this group that was asking about a quick  little duplication button.  So I take that, I forward it over to Ryan and we can jump on that as soon as possible.  So guys, I'm super excited about that.  We've brought that to you.  That is somebody from this group, Ryan Dalton, who not only build a software, but he's scaled  up to a hundred thousand dollars per month in less than two years.  And just in case anyone's wondering what his numbers are.  So Ryan Dalton, by the way, everyone should, should give Ryan some, some love in the comments.  I know he's not on this call right now.  He's, he's probably got a million things going on, but a dude went from zero to a hundred  K a month in two years, kept his job.  Okay.  Also as a family has a regular life.  He's not just like, you know, let's say Elon Musk that just got divorced three times.  He's kept all that.  And they built rank and run engine on top of that, which is unbelievable.  So his breakdown, he's making a hundred thousand bucks per month.  Eighty six thousand of that is purely Legion.  So he's making over his run right now is over a million dollars a year just on lead generation.  The remaining 14, 15,000 that he's making is a combination of SEO and some PPC management  on some ad stuff.  Okay.  The way I always look at it, guys, is if somebody else is out there that can do it, somebody  else out there that bleeds",

There's no difference between me and anybody else.  Differences is they're figuring, they figured out how to use leverage and how to focus on  one thing for a longer period of time.  That's it.  So that's exciting for me when I ever, I see anyone that's way ahead of me.  If I see someone that's making a million dollars a month, well, then of course it's possible  for me.  Okay.  So anyway, guys, that's the updates on Rank and Run Engine.  For those of you, because I have one or two people every time that message me, I'll drop  this in the chat.  We have a discount code for anyone that wants to check that out.  Let me go ahead and drop this really quick if I can find my browser.  There it is.  New landlord, discount on rare.  All right.  With that said, I want to, I just want to say one thing and then we're going to get,  I'm going to get Kyle on here.  We're going to be talking about closing on the first call.  I want you guys to think for just a moment, okay, about a time, whether it was in this  business or it was just a time in your professional life or maybe it was just in your regular  life.  But like, I want you to think about a time when, and Kyle Patton, Mr. Frickin' 6'9\",  I want you to do the same if you're listening.  I want you to think about a time that you were just humming.  Time was on your side.  Everything was clicking.  You guys know exactly what I'm talking about.  It's like you're excited.  It feels like you're making deals.  You're closing deals all over the place.  Everything's going your way.  Obviously, it's not easy, but you're just, you have the energy, the excitement to keep  going because things are happening.  You're seeing progress.  Everything's just clicking.  Okay.  Again, preferably if you could think of a time in this business, I can think of a time.  That's 2020 for me.  Okay.  But that was the first time I really, really felt it.  And I want you to ask yourself the following questions because this is what I've been asking  myself all of this year.  Okay.  Number one, have you stopped doing the things that got you to where you are today or that  got you to the success that you are thinking about?  Okay.  Have you stopped doing those things that got you that success?  That's question number one.  This is rhetorical.  You can answer if you want.  Secondly, on the flip side, have you started doing things that you weren't doing when you  had the success?  Example, you weren't watching Netflix every single night.  Now you are.  I want you to legitimately think about that.  Have you stopped doing the things that got you where you are today or that got you to  that success?  Have you started doing things that you weren't doing when you had the success?  So guys, the reason I'm bringing this up is I'm talking to myself because at the end  of last year, I realized that the very things that allowed me to create two seven-figure  companies in three years, literally all the basic little tiny things that I was doing  that got me the success of creating two seven-figure companies, I had stopped doing.  I slowly stopped doing",

    "pageContent": "last year and it's embarrassing to say, but I have to own it.  It happens slowly over time.  You stop doing your weekly planning and all of a sudden you stop doing your company meeting.  Then you start doing this.  You start going out on Tuesdays or going out on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday instead  of saying, hey, I'm just going to go out on Saturday, I'm just going to go out on Friday.  For me, 2020, I was super scrappy.  I was hustler.  I was willing to do things that were unscalable.  I was willing to jump on a sales call at 7 a.m. on a Saturday morning.  I actually chose to schedule a sales call every Saturday morning at 7 a.m. just to get  my butt out of bed and just to get me in bed Friday night.  I was willing to jump on sales calls at 11 o'clock at night.  I was willing to miss events.  I was willing to give up golf and pickleball and all these hobbies to get the deal.  I was scrappy, man.  That was what I did.  I was reading 10 pages of a good book.  All these little things that got me into this success, I had completely stopped doing.  It became very apparent just two months ago in December.  I just looked at my life.  I took inventory.  I'm like, what am I doing?  I stopped doing all of those things.  I had started watching Netflix during the week.  I'd started spending time during the workday doing hobbies when I should have been working.  I started taking meaningless calls that weren't getting me closer to my goal.  I started going out on the weekdays instead of just the weekends.  Guys, on January 1st, I made a commitment.  I'm like, I'm cleaning this up.  I am done.  I'm going back to the basics.  I went live yesterday and I told you guys this, but guys, January, and shout out to  Kyle who's going to jump on, he crushed it.  We had the biggest month we had in over 12 months, probably further than that, but we  January than we had all of 2024 in any of the months of 2024.  By the way, my internet looks a tiny bit glitchy.  I apologize.  We're going to just roll with it.  So guys, don't forget what brought you the success in the first place.  Do not forget, and I'm not trying to be motivational, whatever.  I'm just speaking to myself.  Don't forget those things that got you the success in the first place.  It's all those little things that add up.  I promise you that.  So with that said, let me get Kyle on really quick and let's talk about closing on the  first call.  Real quick, David Dale, is Rankin' Red Academy separate from Digital Landlords?  David Dale, yes.  Rankin' Red Academy is separate from Digital Landlords.  Rankin' Red Academy is basically like the equivalent of our old Facebook group.  And by the way, you can message Ashley, you can be a part of it, you can go and build  the community, whatever, but you do not need Rankin' Red Academy.  If you're looking at spending time in Rankin' Red Academy, and here, this is a trillion  times better, right?  The only reason I'm talking about Rankin' Red Academy is we have a live call on Monday  7 a.m.  If you want some extra time with me, you want questions answered from me, jump on 7 a.m.  MST.  There's",

Laura Shepard's on.  Kyle Patton, what's up, bro?  What's happening?  Can you hear me?  Yeah, I can hear you.  Amazing.  Okay, Kyle, you're going to give me 13 seconds while I go close my door before you guys keep  hearing my kids.  Hold tight.  You know the drill, bud.  Go ahead and welcome the people.  You know, this is not my, dude, just sit here and talk in front of people that I can't see.  But what's up, everybody?  If you got sales questions, start dropping them in the chat.  All right, bud, don't worry.  I'm back.  This is not Kyle's cup of tea, so give him a shout out.  This is my cup of tea.  Kyle, I promise you, you start doing this regularly, bud, it will become your cup of  tea.  I don't think so, man.  So guys, Kyle, let's see a couple things about Kyle.  Let's give it for anybody that doesn't know Kyle.  You should know Kyle because you spoke with him to get in this call.  If you didn't, you're one of the rare ones that talked to me, maybe talked to Francesca  because Kyle was on a hunting trip.  But Kyle, how long have you been doing sales, Kyle?  Since 2015.  2015, he started doing door to door sales.  Was it two years you did door to door sales?  Yeah, two years door to door.  Two years door to door sales, then since then, since 2015, all you've done is sales.  Right.  Yep.  And you've sold everything imaginable, short of like magazines and like shoe cleaner, right?  Anything and everything.  Yep.  Yeah.  So just to kind of give you guys a little bit of an idea, Kyle, we sold alarm systems.  Then we sold a software that we pre-sold a software that never became a software.  So that is impressive in and of itself that we sold something that never was anything.  We didn't know at the time.  Then from there, we tried to sell, what was it?  We tried selling SEO services, some paper lead, lead gen services.  Then Kyle and I had like a falling out.  Long story.  We'll share that one another day.  It was good.  Kyle went and where did you go work?  What did you go do sell?  Software for storage facilities.  Yeah.  Kyle went and sold software for storage facilities.  But even before that, he was selling like those cartoon infographic things, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why draw?  Don't forget about this, bro.  You sold those two.  Dude, Kyle has sold everything.  Finally I was able to convince him in, what was it, 2022 to come back to the promised  land.  And here he is.  Guys, Kyle is an amazing resource for you guys.  The good thing about Kyle is he has a very different sales style than myself, where I'll  say things that can maybe get under people's skin or maybe a little bit too, they're a  little bit on the edge.

    "pageContent": "Kyle, I don't think, have you ever made anyone upset on a call?  I try not to.  I don't think so.  I'm sure there's been a couple, I've ruffled some feathers, but it's pretty rare.  Yeah.  I like it because for a lot of you guys, it's way more relatable to the way that he sells.  And he's actually, so obviously you guys know he's the one that brought you guys in here.  Kyle has brought in, how many students have you brought into this program?  Just over 500 now.  Just over 500.  So we have like, what, close to 800 students, right?  Something like that?  Yeah.  So close to 800.  So Kyle's brought more people into this group than I have.  So Kyle has in the last two years has done far more sales than I have done.  So anyway, I just want you guys to know that back story, to know that he is a very credible  person when it comes to sales, he's been, I bet you he's done more sales calls than  I have at this point because he's done so many, he's doing multiple per week.  So anyway, let me just kind of set the background.  And by the way, Kyle, just for everyone to have an idea, like you didn't grow up doing  sales.  What you did before sales just to paint a picture.  Yeah, I grew up working kind of on a neighbor's farm and then worked at Cal Ranch in high  school and then painted houses for like six years, worked for a fencing company.  So pretty much all physical, physical labor, manual labor kind of jobs, nothing, nothing  within sales.  Yeah.  When I met Kyle trying to convince him to do door to door, he was doing house painting.  So he was just a regular like blue collar dude.  And the only reason that I knew he would do well is we had a mutual friend that was like,  hey, you should hit my buddy up, Kyle.  And I could just tell Kyle, I'm like, dude, if this guy is willing to paint houses, then  he's going to crush it at door to door sales.  And I remember he was like pretty apprehensive because I don't, has anyone in your family  ever done sales or anything like that?  No.  Yeah.  And it's like a taboo in Utah, you know, it's like you serve a mission, then you go  do door to door sales and everybody thinks door to door sales is just a scam.  So that was like my biggest hesitation.  Yeah, I still, Kyle made me drive up to like four hour drive, like two or three times before  he finally agreed to come and do door to door sales.  So dude, let's do this to start.  This would be fun.  And by the way, today we're going to be talking about closing on the first call, getting someone  on the zoom, not letting them off, getting a yes or no.  But Kyle, let's from what you can remember.  So we recruited Kyle back in 2015.  And we were like, Kyle, come out to Vegas, come out to Henderson, Nevada.  Let's go do some sales training before we just go to Arkansas.  So Kyle comes out.  Kyle, do you remember the first deal that you landed?  Yeah, that old guy, Russ Russell, you never forget the first deal, you know what I mean?  So I just remember I put Kyle in this neighborhood.  He was burning doors, dude.  I mean, you went through like three neighborhoods in three days.  Oh, I was just cooking.",

So finally on Saturday, he gets in this house with this old guy.  And I can't remember what happened.  Somehow I came over the house, dude, and we we we wield and deal, dude.  It was like it was like one of those deals you get on, you pitch at a thousand bucks  a month.  You end up doing it for like five hundred a month and your ads are four hundred.  But you got the deal.  And that was Kyle's first deal.  And he went on to make some great money for the next two years.  And then here we are.  So anyway, guys, let's talk about this.  When I first started doing door to door sales, and I'm sure you were the same, Kyle, I would  get the objection like I want to think about it.  Leave me with your card, all that kind of stuff.  And I remember like when I first, first started, I was like, OK, that sounds good.  You'll call it.  So you'll call me tomorrow.  OK, sounds good.  And I take the card and they're like, yeah, Nick, you did such a good job on the presentation.  Like if I can give you a rate or review, I'd love to talk to your manager, Kyle.  How accurate is that?  What?  Like, is that the same thing that you experienced right when you first started?  Yeah.  Yep.  Nonstop.  When we started doing this, like the equivalent would probably be like, well, it sounds good.  So I'm going to talk with the team and I'm going to get back with you.  Right?  Yep.  How many of those deals do you close, dude?  Like, would you say percentage wise, if when somebody says, let me think about it, I'm  going to, I'm going to check the I got to check the numbers, whatever the thing that  comes out.  It's always I want to think about it.  What percentage just letting them right off the hook?  Would you say that you close like you do close some?  Genuinely speaking, if you let everyone off the hook, there's going to be a small percentage  that you do close.  But what do you think that percentage is?  Yeah.  Probably like 5%.  5%.  And you know what the worst part is, is that that 5% ruins you.  Right?  I get you thinking like, oh, that guy came back.  I'm just looking.  I think Sean's on here.  Sean and Gina, I know they're going to comment because they were one of them that ended up  coming back.  But it's very rare.  It's more often they either go here, you know, give you the whole pitch of why they're not  doing it.  100% man.  So there's a book called The Psychology of Selling and it's by Brian Tracy and he talks  about like, whenever we get done with a sale, we think that the prospect just, you know,  we get done off the zoom, Kyle calls me, he's like, hey, they're really excited.  And in our heads, we think that the person, the prospect is over there, you know, just  doing the pros and cons, thinking about joining, thinking about working with us on our lead  gen system, thinking about expanding all of Northwest Arkansas or all of Dallas, Fort  Worth and tree service.  And the",

    "pageContent": "reality is, dude, as soon as they hang, the reality is that they already made  up their minds is actually the truth.  But if they haven't, for some weird reason, the second they get off within five minutes,  they know that like what they're going to do or they know what it is on the call.  They're just looking for a reason or how to tell you how to do it.  And so, guys, what you need to understand.  And I'm going to say this like that, I'm going to say this very boldly because I've seen  it so many times.  This is not from theory.  This is not from reading books.  But I promise you, if you guys are just letting people think about it, letting people leave  you with their virtual card or either we're going to call you tomorrow, guys, it is, that  is literally, it is financial suicide, okay?  The prospect is not going to call you back.  The prospect is probably going to text you an hour later, five hours later, 24 hours  later, and they're going to send you some long message of why this isn't a good fit  for them.  They're going to hold off.  Okay?  The other thing that you don't realize is when you let the customer say, I'm going to  think about it, I'm going to get back with you, you are literally relinquishing all control.  You no longer have any control.  All you are now is a puppy dog that's following up with somebody who you're begging for money.  Okay?  So guys, when I started doing door-to-door sales, I kept getting this and I couldn't  figure it out.  I was like, I was not consistent closing.  I'd get to the end of the call and I would just cross my fingers.  I'm like, I would go for the close and if they did it, I was like, oh my gosh, thank  goodness.  If they didn't, then I didn't know what to do.  I tried all kinds of different stuff.  I was listening to Grant Cardone.  I tried to do these hard closing techniques.  And then guys, this is what changed everything for me is one day I was sitting in a training  and we had, I think I've told you guys this before, but we would do a training.  If you didn't sell the day before, you would have to go to this training where basically  you were shamed.  It was called the bagel meeting, right Kyle?  Which the bagel means you didn't sell.  And these bagel meetings, how many people would show up to these things?  I mean, it depended, but the energy was dog crap, right?  It's like all the people who didn't sell, that made no money, it's like imagine you  went all day, you knocked seven hours, eight hours of doors, and then they're like, you  have an extra meeting tomorrow at 10 a.m.  Dude, energy is like terrible.  So I'm in a training meeting one day, a sales training meeting, and our trainer, he proposed  this idea and he's like, I want to teach you guys this.  And he came up with this concept, he's like, I want you guys to have this mindset.  I want you guys to start implementing this thing where you say to people, and maybe whether  it's out loud or in your head, I don't do comebacks.  Or essentially meaning, I don't do, I want to think about it.  And I remember when he said that, I was like, yeah, right, bro.  Like there's no way, like, you",

    "pageContent": "know, I can think of all these different excuses.  Like you're asking me at 20, how old were you, Kyle, when he did this, do it in ourselves,  25?  Yeah, 25.  25, I think I was 23, 24.  Like you're asking me to ask 40, 50, 60 year old men, 30 year old men with huge houses,  like they have to make a decision, I don't do comebacks, like it was a really bold idea.  And I was like, there's no way I'm going to be able to do that.  But basically, the idea that he proposed to put in our head is that you get an answer  yes or no on the spot, and you'd rather take a no than you would a maybe, and that you  are bold with the customer and say, I do not do comebacks, okay?  So I know, Kyle, when I told you about this concept, I don't know if it was me, it could  have been one of our other managers.  Did you think that that was a crazy, crazy move?  Do you even remember when we came up with this, or did we just train you like that from  the beginning?  I don't even remember.  Yeah, that was just trained like from the beginning, but it was still a wild idea.  It's the same thing.  You're almost confronting these people and saying you have to be bold with your stuff.  It's hard.  Especially like it's much easier to where we're at.  This is why I'm always like, guys, you don't know how good you have it.  Imagine you go in like a little freaking puppy dog door to door in these big neighborhoods  with these giant houses with, you know, and Kyle, you were driving a Volkswagen Golf diesel  at the time.  You could barely fit in.  I was driving a Honda Civic or a Prius and like we're buzzing around neighborhoods, like,  you know, asking bold questions like this.  It was scary.  I remember when the guy said it, I was like, now I had all the objections in the world  in my head.  I'm like, now he's crazy.  I was like, in my head, I was like, well, what if the customer thinks it's high pressure?  You know, what if they think I'm a sleazy salesman?  What if the customer just says no and I lose the deal?  What if the customer kicks me out of the house?  And what if, what if, what if, what if, right?  These are all the things that you think.  And I remember he's like, if you will make up your mind and just follow this advice,  I promise you, you're going to close way more deals than you're going to lose.  And by the way, you are going to lose some deals.  I'm going to tell you guys right now, you are going to lose some deals doing this.  But guess what?  You're going to lose deals anyway.  You're going to lose deals.  This is sales, man.  You're going to lose deals.  So guys, this advice literally changed my life.  Like straight up literally changed my life.  And from that day, I can remember from that very day, I made the decision, the decision,  the decision, and I, it wasn't perfect at first.  It took me a minute to start implementing, but I was like, I have to change something  because I'm not, I'm not consistent.  I'm not closing deals and therefore I'm not making money.  And so I made the decision that I was",

It is a yes or no.  There is no maybe.  Okay.  If the prospect tells, says, Hey, you know, I'm going to have to think about it.  I'm going to get back to you.  That is a no for me.  Okay.  So, um, so guys, what I want to do today in the training, and I'm going to leave some  time for Q and A at the end, but in the training, I want to convince you as best as I can.  And yes, I do want to convince you.  I'm not going to leave it up to you to, to, to think for yourself.  You don't have to do this, but you're talking to two people that have closed a lot of deals  and we've been, we've, dude, Kyle, we have heard every excuse in the book.  Well, and I was, I was going to say the alternative, if you don't do it and the downside, if you  don't do it is you have this like mentality the next day that you're like, Oh, they told  me to come back about six o'clock and so you don't work as hard because you're like, you're  banking on that.  You're like, Oh, they're going to give me a note.  Then six o'clock rolls around, lights are off.  You see him peeking through the, you know, the thing and that's the same with this.  If you're telling the business owner, like, okay, they're going to think about it.  You're not going to go find another business owner in the meantime, but if you get a no  the next day, you're like, okay, I got to go find someone you're actually working where  you know the answer already.  So that's the problem is it gives you this false sense of hope, which then sets you back  further.  It's such a good point.  I can't tell you how many times I've gone home or let's say selling business owners.  I finished a day, got on two, two closing calls, didn't get it, but you know, the one  was like a nine out of 10.  They just had to check the books, they had to just check the finances and the other one,  he just had to check with his partner really quick.  And in my head, I'm like, I'm not going to say anything, but I should have two deals  by 12, 12 in the morning.  And then, you know, I'll hit the gym and really feel good about myself.  You wake up, first one's a text message that says, hey, we're not going to do it.  Second one says, we're going to hold off till the first of next year or we decided not to  go forward.  And now, like Kyle said, you didn't plan for the day properly.  You didn't have your mindset of like, hey, I got to go scrape, I got to go start over.  I got to go hook a new business owner.  You're sitting there going, I'm probably going to get it.  And it completely, it's a domino effect.  And I'm telling you guys, if you get off the call with somebody and they don't do the deal,  just go ahead and assume that it's a done deal, you're not going to get it.  Just assume that it's not going to happen because 90% of the time, you're not going  to get",

So, my goal in the next 15 minutes is I want to convince you guys that if you'll make up  your mind today that it is either a yes or a no, and then you will be strategic in how  you bring it up, because there is a way to do it right, there is a way to do it wrong.  I've done both, okay?  And I'm going to tell you what not to do.  If you'll do this, make up your mind, and just take a yes or no, you are going to close  way more deals than you're going to lose, okay?  And again, you are going to lose some because it's sales, okay?  So let's just go through this really quick.  I have five things I want to cover, is this.  So for this to be as effective as possible, guys, you have to set this up correctly or  you're just going to look like a slimy car salesman, which I admittedly have done before  because I haven't done this properly and you go in and you just, you don't, it doesn't  come across right, okay?  So number one, guys, you have to set the deal up correctly and you have to leave hints that  make sense why you're asking for the answer today, okay?  So I'm going to give you an example in door to door, I'll give you an example in this  business and then maybe if Kyle can think of one in door to door, I'll let him do it.  If not, I'll, I have one, okay?  In this business, one of the things I like to do is I like to plant the idea up front  to let people know, hey, I'm shopping this around.  I'm sending you leads, Mr. Business Owner, but, and I stole this from Jason Allred recently.  I love this one liner he uses, he says, hey, I'm sending you a couple leads, but I just  want you to know just to be completely upfront with you, I'm not exclusive with just you  yet.  I'm looking for the right partner in this area.  I'm not exclusive with you yet, okay?  So you know, letting them know you're working with other people and I'll throw stuff in  on my screencast, you know, hey, like I said, my goal is to work with the person that's  ready to move, the person that's hungry, and if that ends up being you, first, I want to  work with you.  I want you to, I do want to work with you, but if you're a maybe or I'm not sure, then  I got to move on.  I got ads running, if you want to say that, I've got leads coming in that are going to  waste, but you know, if you bring that up, it makes sense when you get to the end and  you say, hey, like, it's a yes or no for me, I got to have an answer.  Kyle, you just, yesterday, by the way, yesterday, me and Kyle, one of the things, as I said  in the beginning of this call, we're going back to the basics.  We're going back to the things that got us to success in the first place.  So yesterday, Kyle and I went over the sales call that he got on the sales call and we  didn't close it.  And Kyle, you had a really, really good one-liner that completely eliminated the objection of  I want to think about it.  You want to share that, dude?  It was so money.  It was clutch.  I love that.  Oh, I think, was it",

    "pageContent": "the hard pressure one?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So I just said, hey, this isn't going to be like a hard pressure, like door to door close.  Like this is really just to make sure you're going to be a good fit.  But with that being said, I am going to ask for a yes or no at the end.  And the guy was like, that sounds fair.  And you got a yes or no, it was a no, but at least you're not sitting there wondering  if it's a maybe, right?  And so, and we went through the pitch, we're going through it again today, but we realized  like that wasn't where he lost the deal.  We lost the deal at a different point that we didn't hit on.  But needless to say, we didn't, at least we got an answer.  And that to me, closure is the best thing in sales, okay?  One of the things we would do in door to door sales is we would let the customer know throughout  the pitch.  Yeah, so we're actually in the neighborhood.  We're here for the summer, but we're here in this specific part of town.  And so what we're doing is we're doing like this group thing where we're going to allow  the technician to come in and install these all at once.  So we don't have to be, you know, driving back and forth, whatever, something that makes  sense where it's like the technician's already in the area.  For those of you that have done sales, it doesn't, you're like, yeah, you can see that  from a mile away that that's complete BS.  But we at least came up with something that sounded like a good reason to say, hey, it's  now or never, okay?  So you got to have a reason.  And to bring it up at the last second, it doesn't work as well.  If you bring it up before and you're like, hey, I'm already working with, I'm looking  at this other guy, I'm going to give you the first chance here because I like you.  But I do want you to know upfront, I want to be completely transparent with you.  I am also talking to another one of your competitors.  I don't feel comfortable sharing the name or I don't care.  You guys can share the name if you want, but I am talking to one of your competitors.  I would love to work with you, right?  So then you get to the end of the call and you can say, hey, I already told you I'm talking  to somebody else.  If you don't want to do it, no problem.  But I'm not taking a maybe.  I'm talking to him today, right?  It's got to make sense.  So number one, guys, you have to set the deal up correctly.  You have to give a reason that when you ask for a yes or no, it makes sense.  You don't sound like a freaking knob, okay?  Secondly, guys, you need to be agreeable.  This is something Kyle's really good at.  So Kyle, like when people are like, hey, I want to think about it.  I need to talk to freaking my goldfish.  You're always really good at this.  What do you say right out the gate before you just go into a freaking objection overcoming  mode?  Yeah, I usually just say like, I agree with them.  Yeah, I get it.  Like it's a decision you got to make.  And then just ask like, typically, it usually is price with anybody, right?  Typically, it's the price.  So",

    "pageContent": "it's like, hey, aside from price, like what else do you like?  What are you wanting to think about exactly?  Yeah, 100%.  And I would even add on that.  So that's a really good guy.  Make sure you agree.  Hey, I feel you, man.  I take the pressure off.  I completely understand what you're saying.  I feel you.  And then the next thing, guys, step number three, you have to, like Kyle just said, he  jumped ahead.  You have to tie them down to the objection.  So you need to figure out what it is they actually need to think about.  So I think it can change.  I think price can come up.  It depends on what you're selling.  But I honestly think when selling business owners, I don't get with business owners specifically,  I don't get price as much because I've already gone through the screencast.  I've already showed them the lead value calculator.  And it is an investment that they're making that they're going to make their money back.  But you have to tie it down.  For example, if Kyle was my prospect, I'd say, Kyle, so just really quick, if you don't  mind me asking, I just want to get on the same page as you.  What exactly is it that you want to think about?  Yeah, I mean, I just kind of have this principle that I don't make same day decisions.  It's kind of been the thing that's got me to where I'm at in business.  I want to punch you in the face, Kyle.  That one is the worst.  And it's like, how do you argue with somebody that don't base principles?  OK, so let me ask this.  I'm assuming, Frank, I'll say Kyle, I'm assuming, Kyle, because of that, you got burned at some  point in the past.  And that's the reason why.  Like, is there something that I'm trying to dig a little bit.  So when did you get burned?  And he's going to tell me, well, I bought this car, blah, blah, blah.  So I'm going to say, so what do you think?  Like, obviously, if you were 100% certain about this and you knew that you were going  to get your money back, you were going to grow from this, it was going to be a good  partnership, you weren't worried I was going to scam you, this would be 100%.  Yes, there would be no doubt.  So I guess I'm just trying to figure out there's got to be a question.  I usually don't say there's got to be an objection.  You know, I don't like to put that in their head that they have an objection.  But what's your question, man?  Not to cut you off, but Kyle, you're already paying for Google Ads or you're already paying  for Home Advisor.  You already told me you're sick of them.  You already told me you want to grow this year.  I've already sent you five leads.  One of them you already closed, or if they haven't closed, don't say that.  You already know everything about me.  I've shown you what I've done for my, you know, whatever in the next town over.  So I understand what, and again, I'm saying this because I told you I'm already talking  to somebody else.  I'd like to see if we can make this work.  What is it that you want to think about?  And guys, you got to figure out what it is.  And if you push hard",

Well, you know, I just got to check because, well, like, yeah, I told you that we're making  30 grand a month.  However, we just had the engine in our car go out.  And guys, what you got to realize, especially with men, Kyle, tell me if I'm wrong, but  especially with men, we're so prideful.  We do not want to for one second tell them, like, I can't afford it.  Right.  Like, who wants to say, yeah, dude, money's tight.  I know I told you I was killing it.  I know my Instagram says I'm killing it, but I actually don't have 10 grand.  I actually don't have a thousand bucks a month.  Right.  And the reality is they're sitting there going, I don't have $500 to run on my credit card.  Right.  So you have to figure out what it is.  If you don't figure out what it is, guys, you're never going to get the deal.  So let's assume, Kyle, I've gotten past your stupid principle, which is just a smokescreen  anyway.  And you told me it's, let's just say it's something else because you don't get priced  as much when you're doing business.  Let's say that you told me, I don't know, what's another one we get all the time.  Let's say you got burned in the past or whatever.  You want to make sure that you want to talk to one of my clients.  Something like that.  Right.  So you got to tie the next thing, guys, you figure out what it is and you got to tie them  down to that objection.  So Kyle, besides wanting to make sure I'm legit, make sure that I'm not like these leads  that I sent you.  I didn't go and like, I don't know, I don't even know where I'd pull them from, but let's  say they're not a couple of my buddies from around town that are fake estimates that you  closed one of them.  Right.  I'm going to make it seem ridiculous.  Besides the fact you want to make sure I'm not a complete scam.  I'm not the Tinder swindler.  Is there anything else that doesn't make sense about this that would stop you from moving  forward today?  And then he'll say, yeah, no, if he says, yes, you need to figure out what it is.  Well, I also this, right.  And you got, and then once you say that, if they say, no, that's it, say, okay, now guys,  we've tied them, we've pushed them into a corner.  We've tied them into a corner.  We call it a tie down, right?  It's the same thing.  You can use the other analogy.  You're in a house in order to close the deal.  You need to completely seal.  You're in a room.  You need to completely seal it.  You have the door.  You have the windows.  You get three, four windows.  And each one of these objections, you need to close all of the windows and doors and  figure out where the leak is.  And if it's that one window that's price, that's it, but you got to make sure everything  else is closed.  Otherwise, as soon as you close the price window, then the freaking, I got to talk to  my goldfish over here or my wife because she's going to get mad at me. ",

    "pageContent": "That window opens, right?  You have to tie them down to one objection.  Okay.  Guys, and I was going to say one other thing.  I think it also comes back to like making sure you're qualifying people correctly.  Just because when you said that with the price, it just, you know, business owners, I've had  calls before where I've like, I've been so desperate just to pass off the leads to anybody  because I didn't want him to go to waste that I didn't qualify the business owners correctly.  So then when I got on the zoom call, I'm actually like, dude, this guy is like working out of  It's like him working out of his, you know, garage and like, he doesn't actually have  a legit company.  And so it's like, when I hit him with price, he's like, well, I could give you 250.  It's like, oh, I would have saved myself so much time if I actually would have qualified  him when I was getting him on the hook.  And that's part of the setup, you know.  That's a really good point.  That's, that kind of, that should, that's even before all of this, that's, we're assuming  with what we're talking about today that you've qualified correctly, but if you guys remembered  from my training, usually when you when you're losing the deal, it's usually the step or  two before.  OK, so if you're getting to the end of the call and you're getting this time and time  again, hey, I literally don't have money.  Like I'll show you my bank account and guys, I don't know about you, but I've had people  literally show me their bank account.  They're like, dude, no shame.  There's like seven dollars in there.  I've actually had that happen.  That's a qualification issue.  And no matter any of this stuff you do, you're not going to get around it.  Let's assume you qualify them correctly.  That's a really good point, Kyle.  Once you so just to review, you're going to make sure that you you you make it make sense.  You have something kind of jammed in there that's like, OK, it makes sense.  They ask for the deal.  Number two, you're agreeable.  Number three, you figure out exactly what the objection is and you tie them down.  Then what I like to do and Kyle's really good at this as well is you want to use the neighbors.  You want to use your other customers to close.  OK, it's way better when we say, hey, you remember Fred that I told you about that he  felt the exact same way that you feel.  And he's what he ended up thinking and realizing was this.  That sounds so much better than me coming at you and going, dude, you're stupid.  Why don't you understand this?  They can relate to Fred, who's another business owner that's a client of mine, way more than  they can relate to you.  And again, yesterday, Kyle and I are watching the sales call and he's done this so long,  he weaves in.  Anytime he has an opportunity, he was like, hey, have you heard of this person?  Let me tell you a little bit about them.  So now he's like, by the time the close comes, he's talked about three or four other people  who are already making money.  And he can come back and be like, hey, you remember that person I told you at the beginning?  Let me tell you about them.  When I went to close them, they",

    "pageContent": "were not ready to go at all.  They were the same thing as you.  They have a principle of 24 hours, whatever.  So guys, you want to sell through the neighbors, you want to sell to the business owners, and  you want to use them and use their story to explain how they, despite having doubts, were  able to make this decision.  Now, there's a method for this.  It's called feel, felt, found.  We don't have time to go into depth on that.  It's a completely separate training.  But I think inside of the, I'm almost positive, inside of the premium training library, premium  sales training library, for any of you that are paid in full, message Ashley.  If you're paid in full, you'll have access to the premium sales training library.  I think we have a video, maybe even a few, on the feel, felt, found method.  I'm almost 100% positive.  But you're going to sell through the customer, okay?  Example is this.  You know, hey, you remember that guy I told you about, Brooks?  The one I've been working with since 2020?  Funny enough, when he started, it was the exact same thing.  He was actually paying Home Advisor only like 300 bucks.  And for him, he was like having a hard time wrapping his head around tripling the price.  But then when he, what he said to me once we started talking about is he actually realized  that even though he was only paying 300 bucks a month, he was literally competing for every  one of these leads.  He was sharing these leads with three, four, five people.  So for every one of those leads, Home Advisor was actually charging triple.  So it was like, those leads were worth a thousand bucks a month, but he was only paying 300.  And that's why he wasn't closing any.  So for him, he's like, if I can close one deal from these exclusive leads, it makes  sense.  And that's why he decided to move forward.  Whatever it is, I would try to be more succinct than that.  I'm just coming up with something on the spot.  But use other people, other business owners, other deals that you've done, or other deals  that people have done inside of this group, if you don't have any deals yet, to go ahead  and overcome that objection that they have.  And then from there, guys, you can go back for the close, okay?  And so, guys, I'm telling you, if you will do this, and I'm going to end with one last  thing where you need to go for the close again, but if you guys will just make up your mind  to do a yes or no on every single call, you are going to close way more deals.  What it is, guys, think about it like this, you get to the end of the call, you have a  business owner that's sitting on the fence, right?  They could go yes, they could go no.  And I'm telling you, if you walk away from the deal, leaving them sitting on the fence,  the majority of them are going to tip on the side of no.  If you will be bold, if you will ask for an answer, if you will ask for a yes or no on  the call, you are going to tip a percentage of them that are leaning your way, you're  going to tip them on your side.  That nudge is going to get them on your side.  Kyle, we had a call, I was in Africa, what was this, two, three weeks ago, Kyle was on  a call.",

This person was about to start school, they were super interested and everything made  sense, blah, blah, blah.  I hopped on the call and basically reiterated what Kyle said, I'm like, hey, the reality  is because this person was like, I want to get to the new place, I want to get settled  and I'm going to have a better idea of my time.  I basically said to him, we tied him down and I said something to the extent of, here's  the reality, man, if we hang up this call, you already know the decision, whether you  get down there today, tomorrow, whatever, if you want to make this work, you're going  to make it work.  I don't know what your situation is going to look like, but I can tell you that if you  want to make this work, you are going to make it work because I've seen tons of other people  do it.  So let's do this.  I think what we ended up saying, we didn't even ask, we're like, I'm going to take a  thousand bucks down, the rest is going to be next week on this day and we're going to  get you going today.  And do you remember the guys like, okay, I think we can do that.  Do you remember what I'm talking about now?  Probably not because you do so many calls.  But anyway, I remember that call and all it took was like, hey, we're not doing that.  And if it's a no, if it's a I want to think about it, you're not our guy.  I want business owners that are like, and guys, it's true, man, business owners that  can make a fricking decision are business owners you want to work with, right?  If they're hum-hum around with you, they're not going to be closing fricking people that  want, that want their concrete services.  They're going to believe their stupid objections to a good salesperson is also somebody that's  confident in making a decision, okay?  The better I've gotten at sales, the easier it is for me to go and buy something on the  spot.  The easier it is for me to make a decision on, on whatever it is, whether it's a $20,000  program, whether it's buying a $220,000 G-Wagon off the lot without talking to my spouse.  I don't care because I'm like, I'm confident in making that decision because I know I can  go and make the money back or I can take the knowledge and make the money from that thing.  Okay, so just to review, you to make this effective, you have to put something in there  that makes sense, okay?  We're talking to other business owners.  Step number two, you have to be agreeable.  Step number three, you got to figure out what the objection is.  You got to tie them down, okay?  Step number four, you're going to use the neighbors.  You're going to use the neighbors meaning the customers, your other customers that you've  sold before.  And step number five, guys, is you're going to go back for the close, okay?  And you're going to say something like, so Brooks, like, or Bob, Kyle, like I told you,  you're in the exact same situation as him.  Nothing's going to change.  If I get off this call, the only thing that's going to change is I'm going to be going and  working",

You told me that you close at this percentage with this profit margin in this.  We did the numbers in the lead value calculator.  Price is not an issue.  There's nothing that's going to change from now to tomorrow.  Let's do this deal, man.  What, you want to put the Amex or Visa on file?  Let's do this, right?  And it doesn't have to be that bold.  You could say something else.  Kyle, how do you go back for the close after you've tried to do it and then you do it again?  What's your go-to?  I don't know.  It usually actually just kind of falls in place.  Like once you've kind of been like, well, you know, because even with the business owners,  you can be like, well, let's just do like a weekly deal, like a weekly payment.  Yeah.  So instead of like, yeah, fifteen hundred bucks a month, let's just do, you know, whatever  that is, two seventy five a week or three seventy five, whatever that comes out to.  And so almost a different like Amex or Visa, but like, OK, let's just do weekly versus  monthly.  But usually once you talk to them, usually they're just like, yeah, that makes sense.  Like let's just do it.  Yeah.  Kyle, you're using an assumption close just by doing it.  So Kyle, what he's saying, he's like, OK, so besides price, well, let's make this easy.  You said price.  And then when it comes to price, you want to dig in a little.  Are you talking about the, you know, the whatever?  I'm guessing the monthly chunk kind of scares you.  Let's make it easy.  I'll take this.  I'll split it up into four payments.  And then that's the way it's more digestible.  Sound fair?  Boom.  Done.  You got it.  That's the steps, guys.  The last thing I want to say is if they still are sitting there hum, hon, whatever, I would  say something to this extent, OK, this is something that I would use again and again  and again.  I would say something to the extent of this.  Look, sir.  Look, ma'am, I've been doing this a long time.  You've already told me you're unhappy with HomeAdvisor or Google Ads.  You told me you're interested in growing and you love the exclusivity of what I'm offering.  You said you've seen what I've done for Joe, for Jack, for Brooks, whatever.  And on top of that, I've sent you three leads for free.  And no disrespect, Kyle.  But if it doesn't make sense at this point and you're still like a maybe, I respectfully  I want to retract my offer, I'm a no.  Bold statements.  And you just be quiet.  And why do you do that, Kyle?  Explain what the psychology is behind that.  It basically just gets them thinking.  It's kind of the first person who speaks loses kind of deal, but it just makes them actually  make a decision instead of you jumping in and being like, oh, well, if you don't and  then it gives them an out.  So it basically takes the out away.  So if you go through all those steps and they're still like, hey, I still got to think about  it, then you got to go and you got to say what I just",

If you're a maybe, you're not my guy.  And the reason, guys, if you do that, what you're doing is you're taking the control  back.  But also, if they are actually this is the psychology.  If they were going to do it tonight or tomorrow or in three days, if you take the deal away,  if they were actually going to do it, if you retract the deal, I promise you they're going  to come with you.  And guess what?  The people that were never going to do it, you know what they're going to do?  That's the perfect out.  They're going to say, well, I guess I guess that's fair.  I had this happen yesterday.  We had a business owner, me and Francesca did this this proposal and they were hum-hum.  It was the sister that kiboshed the deal, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And finally, we were like, what should we do?  Should we try to hit him with something?  Get back on the phone.  I said, you know what?  Let's just see where they're actually at, because I was like, I don't think it's going  to work anywhere.  So you know what I did?  I did exactly that.  I did it over a text because it was just the situation and I sent him a text.  I said, hey, whatever.  I think his name was Brandon.  I said, Brandon, no offense, but we've been going back and forth.  It's like our third time doing this.  I feel like you're on board, but your sister, every time we talk to her, she just kills  the deal.  I said, respectfully, we're going to retract our offer.  And you know what he said?  He didn't say, okay, let's do it.  He said, I think that sounds fair.  Sorry, it couldn't work out.  The dude was never going to do it.  Imagine if we had been sitting there thinking, oh, this guy's going to call us and think  about it.  They're not going to do that, guys.  So if you get to the end, you go through the steps and they still are a maybe, you need  to withdraw.  You need to retract the offer.  I'm going to say that one more time, ma'am, sir, Kyle, look, I've been doing this a long  time.  Okay.  I've already, you've already told me you're unhappy with home advisor or whoever.  You told me you're interested in growing.  You told me you love the exclusivity of what I'm doing.  You've seen what I can do.  You've seen it with these other people.  I've shown you other projects I've done, and I've already sent you three leads for absolutely  free.  Have you had anyone else do that for you?  I don't think so.  At this point, if it still doesn't make sense, if you're still a maybe, I just don't think  this is going to be a good fit.  I want somebody that's confident in making a decision and wants to work.  You've told me everything that you're ready to go, but now you're hesitating.  Respectfully, if you can't say yes now,",

But what you've done is you've saved yourself an entire 24 hours, 48 hours, maybe a week  time thinking you're going to get a deal that you're not going to get.  You can wake up, you can get off the call, get pissed off for a second, go hook another  business owner and write that person off.  And I'm not saying to end it on a bad note.  I'm saying burn a bridge.  I'm saying retract the offer and move on.  Kyle, anything else I missed?  Well, one thing I was thinking about as you were talking that you do really well that  I don't do as well is calling people out on things that they've said.  So like with digital landlords, of course, we have it like, hey, can you make a decision  in the application?  And then we say that on the call.  And then when we get to the end, they're like, well, I got to make it, you know, I got to  think about it.  And I don't do as well as just calling them out on their bullshit and you do a really  good job.  Same thing with the business owners, like sometimes it's uncomfortable to call them  out when at the beginning, they're like, yeah, I'm hungry.  I'm looking to grow all this.  And then they get to the end, they're like, well, kind of hum-hulling.  Like that's when you can come back and be like, well, earlier you said you were hungry  to grow.  Like, were you just saying that just because it sounded cool or what?  That's something that it takes a little bit.  You're a lot more bold on that kind of stuff than I am.  But, you know, that's one thing tying them back to what they've said.  Yeah, we were going through the call yesterday.  And I think the person that we were, the call that we were reviewing early in the call,  the person said something like, I don't want to waste a bunch of time trying this on my  own.  Right?  I don't want to waste two years trying this on my own.  We get to the end of the call, or Kyle gets to the end of the call, and the guy's like,  he goes, well, I haven't really tried this on my own yet.  And it's like, well, you numb nuts, you said you weren't going to, you said you didn't  want to waste two years.  So now you want to waste two years.  Right?  And I get it.  It's uncomfortable.  But I promise you guys, you're not here to make friends.  You're not here to make friends with your business owners.  You can become friends, but you want them to respect you.  You're here to make them money.  If you can make them money, you will become lifelong friends.  Okay?  But letting them roll over you, not holding them to what they said, that's not going,  they're not going to respect you.  They're just, they're bulldozing you.  Okay?  And I'm not a big fan of the Cardone, hard close, blah, blah, blah, but I'm telling  you guys, this is how I want to end.  If you'll make up your mind today that you are no",

Sometimes it's from your wife or your spouse or your significant other.  Or I remember being a kid and my dad would be like, we got to go.  We got to go check out my, if Porter is on here or Zach,  we got to go check on the pumps.  We got to go check all the font.  Like, dude, I'm driving around with dad, getting a lecture is the worst.  I know the stress.  Typically what we like to do is reminder Mike is during that first contract,  whether it's three months, whether it's six months, whether it's a year,  if you, if you go big boy and you do a big girl, big boy,  and you do a year right at the gate, that is the most important period.  Because if you can get them through that first contract into the second contract,  you're going to see your attrition go way down  and your attention go way up, which is the same thing.  So what we like to do is now it's a little bit different  because I have Francesca that can assist me with this,  but we like to check in weekly with these business owners  at least once a week for the first contract.  Now, typically what that looks like is maybe an email twice a month,  maybe a text message once a month, and maybe a phone call once a month.  Sometimes if they're a little bit like, you know, maybe with this one,  maybe it's a phone call three times a month and it's an email once.  And then the next week, it's like two calls and two emails.  And then the same the next, and it's like, okay, now they're happy.  We can kind of scale back, but I would be checking in at least once a week  until you get to contract number two, which is that year,  because then your attrition goes way down.  Okay.",

    "pageContent": " Guys, welcome to module four and we're going to talk about the finish work.  We're going to talk about on page SEO and we're using the metaphor or we're using the  example of doing this with physical real estate.  So if we had a house or let's say that we had two houses, exact same square footage,  exact same bedrooms, exact same everything and one of these homes had nice finishes.  One of them had, you know, upgraded tile, upgraded fixtures, maybe it had heated floors,  maybe it had like a sauna inside.  That house, even though it's the same structure, could potentially sell for a lot more.  So though I think it's kind of a funny example because our websites are not that pretty,  I'm just giving you an example because what we do with our on page SEO, we can have two  different websites, one with spectacular on page SEO that can generate way more calls  than the exact same website that looks basically the same, almost identical, that does not  have the on page SEO done correctly.  And therefore the first one would generate almost infinitely more leads.  And why is that for those of you that are still wrapping your head around this?  Because if we do the on page SEO correctly, we're going to rank our website and if we  rank our website, we're going to get organic traffic as long as it converts.  But I know it's going to convert because I'm showing you guys exactly what these websites  need to look like.  Long story short, guys, SEO, there are two different sections or two different parts  to SEO.  There's the on page and then there's the off page.  And we are going to talk about the on page SEO, which is exactly as it sounds, the things  that you do on the page.  So a couple of those things, and I'm just going to mention a few, and then we're going  to have individual sections, individual lessons talking about each one and showing you exactly  how to do each one.  Some of the elements to on page SEO.  Page titles.  And we're going to go into that, but that is what we actually title the page when you  are on your browser and you hover over the tab, what is that thing that pops up?  What is the page title?  Or when you go to Google and you type in concrete near me, what is that title that's underlined?  That's the page title.  We're also going to talk about the descriptions.  What do we put in the description?  How do we get people to click?  How many characters can we do?  We're going to talk about H1s.  We're going to talk about image optimization.  We're going to talk about a lot of different elements of on page optimization.  For some of you that might be junkies with this stuff, we're not going to go into every  little teeny thing, but we're going to talk about the most important things, the things  that have helped us and they have worked again and again and again and again.  These are the things that we do, always keeping in mind that if we do the job correctly with  what we talked about in module one of part one, looking for layups, we can eliminate  competition.  That is why I stress so much that we choose the right city and the right niche because  if the competition is not that great, we don't have to do all this stuff perfect.  We're going to do it as best we can and you're going to get better as you go, as you do this.  We're going to show you step by step exactly what to do in future videos.  Guys, get ready.  Let's figure out how we can master the",

    "pageContent": " All right guys, this is where the rubber meets the road. You can do all the previous steps  that we've talked about. You can pick the perfect city and the perfect niche. You can  build this great list. You can go and set up ads. If you do not call, if you do not  do this step because of whatever reason, whether you're scared, whether you tell yourself you  don't have time, it does not matter the reason. If you do not do this step, you will not make  money. You will not get deals. In order for you to close deals, you need to get people  on Zoom. In order for you to get people on Zoom, you need to send them leads. In order  for you to send them leads, you have to call them and get them hooked. In order to hook  them, you need to prospect them. You need to make the calls. Okay? Look, I understand  this part can be very intimidating. This part can be scary, but it's only scary because  you have been calling the wrong people. You haven't had the necessary scripts, which I'm  going to give you, and that's all about to change. A lot of you have seen other people  in this program that were terrified of the phone, that were absolutely doing everything  they could to avoid this one thing. Ironically, this is the one thing that is going to make  the difference between you making money and you not. I want to talk about why do we have  to do this uncomfortable step? Why can't we just skip it? Why this piece? Because this  is the part that everyone's the most scared of, so I want to talk about that really quick.  Number one reason why we have to do this is because this is the one thing that every other  agency owner out there avoids, and you watching this have been avoiding this most likely up  until now. You've done the email campaigns, you've done the messenger chats, you've done  Facebook posts and everything to avoid this thing. If you're avoiding it, every other  marketer is avoiding it. We all know there are programs out there that are trying to  teach you that you can get deals without cold calling. You can get deals by hiding behind  your computer. You can get deals with email drips. Guess what? Most of those things will  work to some extent. However, what I understand is that the things that people are unwilling  to do, if I do them, I am going to have massive success very quickly. Number one reason that  we're going to do this is because no one else wants to. My entire philosophy of life and  with this process is I want to zig while they zag. If everybody's doing this, I want to  do this because if everyone's doing something one way and most people are broke, I should  probably look the other way. Second reason, guys, money loves speed. I'm going to say  that a thousand times during this training and a thousand more times during my live calls  and a thousand more times in our conversations in the chat and one on ones. Money loves speed.  The quickest way to get to a business owner is not through an email, it's not through  a messenger, it's not through a this, it's through picking up the phone and calling the  person as long as we have the right number, as long as we're calling the right person.  This is the quickest way to get deals. I don't know about you, but the reason that I'm in  this, the reason that I discovered this process and I learned this process and I mastered  this process is because I wanted to speed it up. Guys, if you don't want to speed this  up, go do rank and rent. This is rent then rank. We're",

    "pageContent": "looking for speed. Money loves  speed. The reason why we're going to do this quote unquote, and I say quote unquote because  I promise you when you have the right scripts, you have somebody that knows what they're  doing because they've done it thousands of times and you're calling the right people,  this is not anything like cold calling as people define it. We are calling people who  are already interested in our product, who are already paying for our product from somebody  else more than likely and we're giving them results in advance with a script that works.  This is not scary, at least compared to knocking doors and selling home security systems, selling  vacuums, doing actual cold calling. The second reason we're going to do this quote unquote  uncomfortable step is because it's quick. It's fast. It gets us the yes or no as quickly  as possible so we can move on to the next so we can make money.  Third reason that we're going to do this uncomfortable, again, uncomfortable step is because it works.  It works and it always will. I believe one of the most barbaric old school things in  the world is going door to door. I do not believe in going door to door to door. I did  it for four years and you know what's crazy? As much as I don't believe in it, I think  there's so much better uses of your time than literally getting dropped off in a neighborhood  and going door to door to door with all the technology and the information that we have.  I do not think that's a good use of your time, yet it still worked, guys. It still worked  to the tune of me making hundreds of thousands of dollars in a summer and it is the most  barbaric method out there. What we're going to do is we're going to take the concepts  of that, which is direct to customer. We're going to go direct to customer, direct to  the business owner, but we're going to have some information. We're going to talk to only  people who are paying for leads, people who are already sold, and we're going to give  them results in advance. Two things I did not do when I did my barbaric method. This  works. When I say this, I mean reaching directly out. We're going to call it cold calling,  but I almost want you to think of this as warm calling. The third reason that we're  going to do this quote unquote uncomfortable step is because it works. The fourth reason  why we do this uncomfortable step, and I laugh every time I say uncomfortable because compared  to other stuff, this is not uncomfortable, but the fourth reason why we do this is because  we are in charge. We are in charge of, and we can control that we pick up the phone and  we dial a number and we call. I can control that. I can't always control if my email gets  blocked. I can't always control if the business owner looks at their message or whatever,  but when I pick up the phone and I call the phone number, I'm in total control. Now yes,  I guess technically you could say, well, they might not answer, but I'm telling you right  now 99% of the people that we're targeting, their personal cell phone is the one that's  listed on the business. That is how low, that is the type of caliber of people that we are  going after. We are going to be talking to most of these people directly to their personal  cell phone. I'd say 90% of the people you're going to call, you're going to be calling  their personal cell. You're not even going to be working, you're not even going to be  dealing with a secretary or a tracking number",

    "pageContent": "or any of that. Definitely not an 800 number.  We're talking directly to them. What I love about doing this is it puts us in control.  We can sit down every day and say, hey, I'm going to make X amount of calls and I'm not  going to have to worry about my email being blocked or this happening or my account being  suspended here. We are in control. We could pick up the phone and for some reason our  phone gets spammed out or whatever, it gets blocked. We can go get another number. It  allows us to be in control. So guys, this is the step. This is the part where if you,  this is the reality. If you do not do this step, you will not make money. So if this  scares you, good. If this process, if this part of the process frightens you, terrifies  you, welcome to the club. To this day, even me at this point, although this isn't near  as bad as going door to door, it still gives me the butterflies and it probably always  will and that to me just identifies, it just confirms that I'm doing the right thing.  So guys, let's jump in and let's freaking get a business owner on the hook.",

    "pageContent": " I learned this back doing door-to-door sales, okay?  So for example, back doing door-to-door sales,  we were always taught that you do business,  people do business at the kitchen table, okay?  And that was, your chances of closing a deal  at the kitchen table were far better  than sitting at the couch with Jack, the retired Marine,  sitting at the couch while he's watching TV,  way better at the kitchen table because he's focused,  he's watching you, he's paying attention,  and we're doing business, okay?  So the equivalent of that, and this is the first thing  that I would say is a best practice,  I want you guys to write down,  is get them on a desktop or a laptop,  none of this phone bullshit, okay?  Here's why, if they're on their phone,  that gives them the ability to be in their truck,  that gives them the ability to be at the store,  that gives them the ability, who was I on the phone with?  I did a close with somebody, or maybe it was just me,  I can't remember who it was.  Oh, guys, she's not in this group, Preeti,  if you guys watch, I was on her close  when she closed the deal a couple months ago,  like three, four months ago, right?  And we didn't do this, well, she set the whole thing up,  I just hopped on, the guy was on his phone driving,  and he was buying dog food, like, we still got the deal,  we still got the deal, but he was buying dog food,  I was so pissed off, I'm like, bro,  we are literally talking right here,  and you're buying dog food, so make sure they're at a desktop,  make sure they're at a laptop, and if you do that,  they're not gonna be able to be driving around,  or doing this, or doing that,  or jotting down notes, or whatever,  make sure they're at a desktop.  Now, how do you do that without making it sound weird?  This is what I would recommend, I would say, hey,  if possible, please be at a laptop or a desktop,  because I wanna show you a couple things,  it's going to be really hard for you  to see on your tiny little screen.  That's how you're gonna do it, okay?  So the equivalent of sitting at the kitchen table,  in door-to-door sales, which me and Lincoln are familiar with,  and I know Marcus has done door-to-door sales as well,  is being at a desktop, being at a laptop, not on the phone.  Not on something that they can move around with, okay?  Something they gotta sit their ass down and pay attention.  What that's going to allow you to do,  it's going to allow you to get their attention,  and they're gonna move everything else,  and they're just gonna be focusing on you, okay?  It's gonna be really hard for them to get up,  and go get a drink,  because they're gonna have to carry their damn computer,  and if they're at a desktop, they can't, okay?  So make sure they're at a desktop, if at all possible,  and do it by saying, hey, I wanna show you a thing or two.  If you can be on a desktop or a laptop,  that's gonna make it way easier so you can see the screen.  It's gonna be really hard to see on your phone,  which is true, by the way.",

    "pageContent": " Daniel says, I know you talked about 50 and lower on search volume, like 30 or 40.  Yeah, Daniel, he's talking about the base bare minimum search volume.  Guys, what I would say is that I would make sure at this point, and when I do  version 3.0, when that's completed, I'm going to make sure that I'm very, very, very clear about  this. But we're on here live right now. I would make sure it's 50 or above, especially if you're  going after your first deal, because I don't want you guys to get in a situation where you get a  deal, you hook them, or you get the deal, and then the leads kind of dry up, and you don't know how  to navigate around the situation. So for me, if I get in that situation, I already know if I'm  looking at a deal and it's like a 30 volume, 30 search volume, I'm going to tell them up front,  like, hey, this is going to be a fluctuation. I'm going to really sell them hard and let them know  it's going to be a variable volume amount of leads for the first couple of months, because  I just have a feeling, whatever. I'm not going to say that, but I'm going to know.  And I'm going to be able to kind of talk my way through those situations. If it's your first deal,  it can become very scary, and it's like that deal is so important to you. So Daniel, my advice for  you going for that first, second, third deal, go 50 or above. Make it simple.",

It works. And I'm seeing  all these other people doing it. Huh, maybe I should do that too, right? Maybe I should,  because now I don't have to worry because guys, if you go into a brand new niche,  you have no nothing about. You have to figure out if that niche even fits this business model.

    "pageContent": " So why do we use paid ads? Well, I'm gonna tell you. I'm gonna share a quick story. If  you guys haven't heard the story already, great. If you have, bear with me for just  one moment. 2019, I realized in order for me to hit my goal, my goal at the time was  I wanted to get to $100,000 per month in revenue. And I realized I couldn't do that being a  salesman for somebody else. I couldn't do that by being an employee. And so I'm like,  I gotta figure this out. But at the time, I had about $8,000 in revenue coming in. I  had SEO deals. I had a little bit of lead gen and I had some paper lead, had no commission,  and had one or two flat fee deals. And I took inventory of my stuff and I almost forgot  about these couple of flat fee deals. And I looked at it and I'm like, dude, these guys  have been the most low maintenance of any of them. So why don't I do more of that? And  I'm like, okay, it's got to be that. It's got to be that flat fee stuff because in the  winter it's not going to go down. I'm going to be able to calculate everything. It's going  to be the same, you know, it just made sense to me. Okay. So I started realizing, I'm like,  I'm going to do the math. How do I get to $100,000? And I'm like, okay, well, I know  that if I build a site today, it's going to take a minimum of three to six months, three  if I'm really good at doing my due diligence, six if I'm okay. And if I do a bad job, I'm  going to need to spend 12, 18 months before a site ranks. Started doing the math. I'm  like, I'm going to need this many sites and this much ranking and assuming this many don't  work, I'm going to need to spend a lot of money every month to scale this puppy up.  And so I figured out, I'm like, okay, well, you know, and by the way, just so everybody  knows, I heard of this concept. I wasn't the first one to invent it. And this whole strategy  of giving leads in advance, Costco invented it and probably somebody before them. But  I heard of this idea of why don't you run a little bit of ads to juice it up? Why don't  you run a little bit of ads to get the phones ringing? And I'm like, that's a, that's a  great concept. And so I started running with it. And so in 2020, the beginning of 2020,  that's when I really took hold of this concept. I'm like, Hey, what if we could use other  people's money to scale? What if we didn't actually need to build the website before  we got the deal? What if we could set up a landing page, push traffic, get the lead,  get the deal and then build out the property? What would that look like? And so that's why  we use ads. We use ads to speed up the deal. So if you have a site right now and it fits  the criteria for module one and it's producing consistent leads, you probably don't need  to run ads. Okay. The thing that I like about it though, is it does speed up the deal. It  does allow you that let's say the winter comes and it gets a little slow on the organic side,  pop in the ads and it supplements. You know what else I like about it? GMB goes",

    "pageContent": "down,  throw in the ads, supplements it. Okay. So there's a number of reasons, but the number  one reason is we are trying to speed this process up. So I'm going to share really,  briefly three reasons, the three main reasons why I love running ads. Number one reason is speed,  as I've already mentioned. Okay. I don't know about you, but I ain't got four to six months  to wait for a little towing site or a little, I shouldn't even say towing. I hate towing.  A concrete site, a tree service. I don't have four to six months to wait. I want to hit my goals  today, baby. I don't want to wait. Okay. So by running these ads, it's allowing us to put up  a landing page, push ads, get calls today, sell today or tomorrow or the next day, get the deal  and then build out and be making money the entire time. Number two reason is this is going to allow  us to scale. Okay. A lot of you are in the same position I was in in 2000, the end of 2019,  beginning of 2020 where it's like, yeah, I get this. I love it. I'm sold, but I don't have the  money to build out a hundred sites and time, you know, hosting times a hundred, call tracking  number times a hundred, whatever, hosting domain, all this times a hundred. Okay. I didn't have the  money. I don't want to have to pay a VA times a hundred to go and do the backlinks and the content  and all this stuff. I don't, I didn't have the money. So if you want to scale, the best way to  scale in real estate, physical real estate and in digital real estate is called, it's by using OPM.  Other people's money. So by using ads, it allows us to get the deal upfront, use the money from the  deal to build out the property that we own, the asset and to scale the sucker up. Number three  reason is this allows us to test. This is the third reason we use Google ads. Okay. So what do I mean  by that? Well, it allows us to actually put up a one pager that takes a couple of minutes, 30 minutes  to an hour, set up an ad, which take us a couple of minutes, 30 minutes to an hour until you get  fast at it. I can do it in five minutes now. It allows us to spend a couple of bucks, probably up  to a hundred and we can go and test out a market. Meaning maybe the tool that we looked at, maybe it  was mangles, maybe it was keyword planner, maybe it was SEMrush, maybe the tool said there's volume,  but maybe there's not because these tools aren't always accurate. I'd rather spend a hundred bucks  in two days of my time than I would spend six months of my time and heaven knows how many  thousands of dollars just to find out there's no volume. I'm ranked number one whoop-de-doo.  There's no, there's no volume. There's no people calling or worse. There's no hungry business  owner. So if I get in, I can set this thing up quick. I could spend a hundred bucks. I get a lead.  Okay, cool. I know there's volume. And now I can use that lead to go start calling around and see  if there's actually hungry business owners in the area.

And then everything else, I feel like it's pretty similar. Times that are not the best seem to be  like Monday morning. So seem like a little bit tough because everyone's trying to like get after  it. And then it seems like right around like, you know, 11 to one, because something like I can never  tell people eat lunch. Some people eat lunch at once. Some people eat lunch like really early.  So what I would recommend is like maybe try and avoid those times. And then everything else,  I just kind of watch. I actually have had really good luck calling business owners on Saturdays,  like believe it or not, because they're working. The ones that are working, not all of them will  be, but I'll bet that most of the people that are running ads, they've got someone or they or  someone else that they are paying is going to be answering the phone. Saturday, if you call me,  I'm talking about strategizing for my business. I'm talking about on my business, not in my  business. I've had a really good luck on Saturdays. I would just tell you the times that seem to be  hard is first thing in the morning, Mondays, and then like that 11 to one timeframe, just regular  days. Okay. Cause I just never know when they're doing lunch, just personal experience.",

That's one of the mistakes I made you have to do multiple keywords when I was in these other groups  I thought you just went in and let's say it's concrete or concrete contractors  You just type in concrete contractors st  George, Utah, and if it looks good you send it and if it doesn't you don't guys  You're gonna be ranking for different keywords that keyword might be super difficult and the other four or five six  67 are layups, dude. No one's competing  I'll go and take all the traffic for those four rank for those four and that's gonna help and it's gonna bleed over and  It's gonna allow me to rank quicker for the main keyword, right?  If the main keywords concrete likewise are on the flip side you go and do the research and that top keyword is a laydown  Oh, man, there's not even dude all the people in the maps. They don't even have a website shit  It's gonna be easy little do you know if you looked at six keywords the other five they're gonna be a beast, dude  They're gonna be a bitch. It's gonna be really difficult for you to rank  And if you looked at the big picture, you'd realize yeah, you might be able to rank for that keyword  But there's a lot more traffic hiding over here  So it's got to be multiple keywords and in the training we talk about how to build that keyword list  But here's what also school we have 400 plus members in here Theo  If you have a niche you're looking at just ask what key what's the keyword list?

Welcome to call final live how to get to if I was starting  over today, how I would get from zero to $20,000 as quickly as  possible. Appreciate you guys being on. It's 104am for me in  West Africa. But your boy, he took a shower. He's looking  fresh. He's ready to go. I told you I'd come prepared for this.  I've been working on this for a long time. Super stoked to have  you guys on. I really appreciate you being on. But I am in  Africa. So there's a chance my internet goes out. If that  happens, please stay on the live. Porter's going to be able  to be the co host. I'll hop right back on. If the power goes  out, the generator will kick on. But there's going to be a  little little gap. Please stay on and I'm going to give you  some reasons why we're going to be giving away it just for  staying on this live till the end. Number one thing we're  going to be doing is giving you guys a replay. This is not  going to stay up obviously in the free group because that's  changing. But if you stay on this live till the end, you're  going to get a replay of this live today, which I hope you  guys take and watch again and again. You dissect it. You take  notes, everything else. So please stay on that. We're also  going to be doing our giveaways. We've got a bunch of stuff  we're going to be giving away. So stay till the end. I'm going  to pack the training, going to make this really a value field  and we're going to try to end this in 55 minutes. I also want  to let you guys know, you know, what the what the transition is  because the free group is no more. OK, so Porter, you could  still hear me. We're good where everything's good. Yep, we're  good. OK, I want you to monitor the comments. I've also got  Ashley watching live because when we do the giveaways, I want  her to take notes, even though she isn't on this live that you  can see. She's there. She's watching about a whole team  watching. So, guys, let's get into it. This group, the Art of  Digital Real Estate. And by the way, it was called the Art of  Pre-selling before. As you guys know it right now, it will never  be the same as of today. OK, but today I'm going to show you  guys where it's going and how you can be a part of it, too, if  you choose. But we're also going to be doing the training. That's  the main thing is the training, the giveaways. But I do want to  let you guys know where this is going, because this is not going  to be the same as it was this morning. OK, so in addition to  the training, guys, here's what we're going to be doing. We're  going to be giving away two to two different people. We're  going to be giving away three free months of three free a  three free month membership to Rankin and Ningen. We're going to  be giving away five copies of a 12 part exclusive training  series that I did a few months back. We had some amazing  topics. One of the one of the trainings, we had some  incredible feedback. People, to my knowledge, people actually  made money from this specific training. So there's 12. It's  like 12 hours long.",

And then guys, we're also going to give  away one, not a full but a partial scholarship to digital  landlords. OK. Also, just as a reminder, anybody that stays  till the end of this training is going to get a copy of this  training. I'm going to let you know how to do that. We got to  stay till the end to get those instructions. Again, guys, 53  minutes. We're going to buzz through this as quickly as  possible. Guys, it's been an amazing ride. It's been over 150  plus weeks of me pouring my heart and soul into this group.  And I literally mean that. OK, let me give you guys really,  really quick. Just a quick background on this group. OK, I  started it back in September of 2021. This was after I had my  very, you know, I had my first year of making seven figures  renting simple websites in 2020. Then I had another year. We did  like 1.4, 1.45 in 2021. And guys, what ended up happening is  I was sharing my journey, which I encourage you guys to do the  same. I was in other groups. I was sharing my journey in this  specific group. And I started getting people that would send  me messages. They would say, you know, Nick, how did you close  this deal up front? How did you, you know, Nick, how did you  scale to 100, 100K? That's insane. I didn't know anyone  could do that. Nick, my business owner keeps complaining about  the price. What is it? All these different questions. And at the  time, I didn't, you know, I had never had this happen. So it was  kind of fun. It was exciting. I felt I felt like my ego was  stroked a bit. And so two to three times a week, I would  spend after my day was done. It was I remember it was at  nighttime. My kids were asleep. I would spend 30 to 60 minutes  in the evening, opening the messages, turning on the camera,  responding to them directly. OK. But guys, eventually, I started  getting the same questions again and again and again. And I  realized, you know, I'm doing this is being I'm being stupid.  Let me put everybody in a free group. And then when the  question is asked, I'll just answer it once. And then  everybody can come and they can they can look at the answer,  right? Three years from now, you guys can go and look at answers  and questions that were asked three years ago. And that was  the entire goal. And so that's exactly what I did, guys. Three  over three years, three years and five months ago. And I  remember, guys, like I was doing everything at the beginning, I  was answering all the questions. I was also running my agency. I  was going live. I was doing all this kind of stuff. And I was  literally responding to every single question. I wouldn't let  a single notification pass by. So if you guys have ever heard of  Fix It Felix, our our admin, which does a phenomenal job. I  was Fix It Felix. OK, then we had somebody that came in and  helped. And then I hired somebody to help. But I was  Fix It Felix in the beginning. And that's just that's just how  it was. And it was it was super",

But what I've realized is as time has gone on, guys, I've  seen that people they've stopped appreciating what I'm doing.  And I'm not saying I need to be appreciated. But the sizzle is  gone. You know, when you send a business owner, Porter, you  know what I'm talking about? You send a business owner, those  first couple leads are super stoked. And then if you let it  go on too long, they kind of get entitled. Can't send them too  many. You can't send them too many. Right. People stop showing  up to the lives, guys. And I tried all kinds of stuff. I tried  to do them on Zoom. I tried to do a cap to number all kinds of  different stuff. And what I've just seen is a lot of people  have just become parasites, not producers. And I'm not speaking  to all of you, but a lot of people that has happened to. And  so, guys, I want I want to ask you guys, some of you guys are  going to be a little bit. I think I even had an Instagram  message from somebody that I had been talking to. In fact,  somebody that had been on one of the lives with us asked a  question. He's like, well, blah, blah, blah. You're changing the  group. And I didn't just rub me wrong. And I said, dude, same  thing. Guys, if you're sending a business owner free leads, OK,  you guys talk about, hey, we're going to have a conversation.  I'm going to send you free leads, blah, blah, blah, blah,  blah. You send them three to five leads. You hop on a sales  call. You do the whole process and they tell you, you know  what? I think I can do this better on my own or I don't think  I need to pay you. I can just do it on my own. OK, we've all had  that happen. Porter, have you had that happen? Yeah. And it's  going to happen again. But the question is, are you going to  keep giving that person free leads? Obviously not. Right.  You're not going to do that. You're going to stop sending them  leads. So that's that's what this is, guys. That's all that  this is. But this isn't the what I'm doing, the value that I'm  giving me going live, all this content. It's going to a new  home. But it trust me, this is not going away. It's just  changing. OK, so guys, of course, you wouldn't give it to  them. You want you you would say, OK, good luck, go try it  out. And then once they go and try it out on their own, they're  going to come back and say, hey, yeah, those leads, what do  we got to do to work together? Right. They're going to  appreciate it because now it's gone. OK, so, guys, basically  what I'm saying is the days of free ninety nine, it's done.  OK, the the gravy train is over. You don't value what you don't  pay for. I have a thirty thousand dollar program that  somebody gave me the password to just to go and look at not even  the material, but how they structured it. It is sitting.  I have the password. I have it bookmarked. It is sitting there.  I have spent less than",

I know we have six point two  thousand members. Who cares? I don't care if after this live, we  go from six thousand two hundred people to 30 people, because  those 30 people that I'm still seeing are the people that I  want to work with, the people that are serious to the people  that are actually going to take action. OK, so here's the deal.  As of one hour ago, every single training.  Well, I don't think I think we're still working on it as we speak.  But as of one hour ago, I would say 90 percent.  And by the time this is over, by the time the day is done,  every single live training that I have ever done  personally has been deleted from the group.  OK, I've gone live over 150 times.  I've interviewed over 100 people.  Everything that I've ever done in this group personally  has been wiped. OK, it's gone.  It's done. And it is no more.  It's it's it's just gone. OK.  And there are over the next, you know, there might be a few interviews  still that we're trying to pull down, whatever.  But over the next few days, you're going to see everything disappear.  The gravy train is over.  And I want to work with the serious people only.  OK, so with that said, guys, what I'm going to do,  I'm going to spend three minutes, five minutes tops.  And I'm going to show you what right what the art of digital  real estate 2.0 looks like really quick.  I'm going to share my screen and how you can be a part of it.  And then we're going to get into the training, going to get into the giveaways  and leave you guys with a ton of value, give you guys the copies,  the replays for those of you that stay till the end.  And we're going to go from there.  So let me just do this really quick, Porter.  I'm still good on the the volume.  Yep, I can hear you perfect.  All right, guys, I want to present to you.  This is something I'm super stoked about this, guys.  I want to present to you version 2.0.  Let me just make sure I got this right. Hold on.  I don't want to be sharing anything just yet.  Let's make sure everything's good. OK.  Yes. OK, let me go ahead and get rid of this.  Guys, so with that said, I want to introduce you guys  to the rank and rent academy.  OK, that is where we are transitioning.  I'm going to show that to you right now as I share my screen.  OK, Porter, can you see my screen?  Yeah, I can see it perfectly.  Guys, welcome to the rank and rent academy.  This is a this is where our Facebook group has now gone.  And it is where it is going to be.  I'm going to give you guys a link here in just a moment  if you guys want to check it out.  But I want to just walk you through it really briefly.  Again, three minutes tops.  What we have some introductory videos  and stuff that explain how all this stuff is laid out.  But I want to walk you through the content really quick.  We have over I think it's 15 to 17 mini courses.  They call these mini courses.  You can also view",

By the way, really quick, if you're in digital landlords  and you're freaking out going, oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh,  this is not for you, you guys will have access to this.  Do not worry.  We're going to get you guys access to this  because you're part of digital landlords.  So don't be freaking out. You don't need to go whatever.  You're going to have access to this. OK.  But I do want to just show you this.  This is the classroom section.  This we're going to be adding to this every single month,  if not every single week.  I want to show you two of my favorite sections.  But obviously, guys, we talk about mapping your goals,  the mindset, tools, niches, due diligence, SEO, sales, all that kind of stuff.  This is these are two of my favorite mini courses.  Really quick. Number one is the vault.  OK, the vault, guys, is where I am going to be putting all of the library,  all hundred and fifty plus lives that we've done over the past  three and a half years are going to be found in the vault.  Right now, we have six different lives.  And every single week with that, to not overwhelm you guys,  every week, we're going to be adding one to two new lives that we did  back in twenty, twenty one, twenty, twenty two, twenty, twenty three.  We're just going to be stacking this vault with every bit of content.  OK, that module is going to be packed.  That, I guess, mini course is going to be packed with all kinds of training,  all kinds of stuff from ads to, you know, how much should this.  I mean, every nuanced topic you could possibly think about.  OK, that's that one.  The other one I want to show you guys is this, the interview series.  This is where I have interviewed over a hundred.  I think it's maybe even over 200 people, people just like you,  people from all walks of life, moms, dads, single moms, single dads,  people with speech impediments, people with accents, people with  no sales experience, people with no technical experience,  people that are retired, people that are young,  all kinds of different walks of life where I've interviewed them  and I've gleaned and I've tried to pull out what has helped them to be successful.  And we're going to have all those interviews inside of here.  Again, we're going to be adding, I think we have six in there right now.  And we're just slowly adding every single week.  We're going to be adding new interviews.  I don't want to just I didn't just want to throw everything in there  and just the vomit on you guys.  I want you guys to catch up on all the content.  And then every week you have like a little goody to watch a little  45 minute to an hour  vault video as well as the interview series.  OK, because also we have the replays, a bunch of different stuff.  Another thing I want to show you guys that's really, really cool  is we have this community world map where you're going to be able to see  where every single person that's in this community is, where  let's say you guys go on a little vacation to Vegas for your buddy's  bachelor party, you're like, hey, while I'm in Vegas, I want to spend,  you know, an hour on Tuesday and try to link up with somebody else ",

Guys, the community, this is this is what I've realized.  I've bought twenty three thousand dollars plus in courses  just related to rank and rent.  I always watch the the the course, you know, once maybe a year.  But I'm in the community every single day.  I've literally made I have two partners right now  that I've made from my community.  I have I've made I've had deals come out of it.  I've had friendships come out of it.  I've had all kinds of stuff that have come out of it.  So the community, guys, is is where I think the value of these.  And ironically, school calls these communities, but it's a group.  That is where I think the value is.  OK, so obviously, you can have the community aspect.  You're going to have the classroom.  You're going to have the community world map.  And then every single week, you can notice on the calendar.  I am going to be going live every single week.  Porter, can you see this on my screen?  Yep, I guess every single Monday to start the week, seven a.m.  I put it as a Q&A, but sometimes it's going to be training,  sometimes going to be Q&A every single Monday.  Me, I'm going to be live.  I'm going to be talking to you guys.  Any questions that you have, we're going to be going on to a live.  And the other thing, too, is all those lives are going to be put into  the replay section in case you can't catch it.  OK, so guys, there's a ton of other stuff.  I don't want to bore you with all the details,  but this is the Rankin Red Academy.  I've been working on this for months.  We're like, where do we transition?  What do we do? What do we do?  And this is it, by the way, all of the material in here.  Let me give you a little sample.  Let's go to let's go to the map your goal section, for example.  All of these videos that are in here, OK,  every single one of these videos, this is not training  that I pulled from somewhere else.  These are all new videos.  OK, this is all new content that I have produced for this community.  So all of this is new stuff.  OK, so that said, guys, that is where this is going.  The art of digital real estate, RIP, it was real.  Now we are moving into the  Rankin Red Academy.  And if you guys want to check that out, I'm going to go ahead  and just drop a little linky poo, by the way, just so you guys know  our plan with this.  I didn't even mention this, by the way, this is paid, by the way.  Our goal is we're going to be charging 100 bucks a month.  This is a this is it's a community.  So you pay every month.  But the introductory rate, what we're doing for this launch  is we're doing at half price.  We're doing at $50 per month. OK.  Now, one of the thing you need to know, that's why you digital  landlord students, don't worry, you're going to get access  any money that you spend. OK.  Any money you spend on the Rankin Red Academy,  we're going to take 20",

So if you're in for a year, we'll take 20 percent of that.  That will be a discounted rate off of your digital landlord membership.  So you're you being in this is you're in a way kind of paying towards that,  which you'll eventually join, we hope, at some point. OK.  So that's it, Isaac Cheatham.  What's the main difference between this?  Isaac Cheatham, you have access to this, so don't worry about it.  This is this is the this is the beginner.  This is the free group.  This is basically the free group.  We're going to have the community.  We're going to have the training.  But we're not touching on anything that's in digital landlords.  So the difference is everything.  So in case anyone's like, well, I'll just get into this.  No, this is very different than digital landlords.  But this is basically the free group on steroids.  We're going to give it attention.  We're going to be having, you know, Porter and Jason are going to be in there  giving the the free coaching calls.  If you guys want to jump on those,  we're going to be doing giveaways, new trainings all the time.  But Isaac, this is nothing, nothing the same as digital landlords.  OK, this is like this is where you start.  This is the free group. Move to this. OK.  But you get access anyway, so it doesn't matter.  So here we go.  Rankinretire.com.  Easy peasy. Porter, you want to try that link?  Rankinretire.com.  And then, guys, we're going to get into the actual training.  We're done.  Hold on one second.  Make sure that work that post.  Yep, got it. Beautiful.  Let's make sure it goes to the old community.  And there it goes.  OK, let me just see if I can pin this.  Chris Aren't said people appreciate what they pay for.  Yes, 100 percent.  By the way, Chris, Isaac, those of you that are in digital landlords,  do not be afraid, my friends.  You guys have access to this.  I'm going to be working with the team to figure out how we give you access  so you don't have to pay.  So none of you digital landlords go and try to pay, please.  For everybody else, if you want to be inside the community,  it is $50 per month right now.  Again, 20 percent of that is going to be credited  towards your digital landlords membership when you make the jump. OK.  All right. And by the way, funny enough, Isaac asked what the difference is.  I literally have a note right here.  This is not digital landlords, guys.  We're not teaching the same stuff at digital landlords.  Don't expect to go in and learn, you know, exactly what digital  landlords students are learning.  This is an intro to the rank and run.  This is a community, this access to myself, my team, et cetera.  But I will tell you guys, there is going to be a ton of value in that vault.  OK, a ton of value in that vault.  You guys are going to be able to pull from that.  Just that one mini course.  So just so you guys know, that's that.  Welcome to the rank and run academy.  And guys, one more thing I want to mention,",

And I found this closed sales call back in 2018  that anybody that joins today, I'm going to I'm going to share this with you guys.  I'm going to let you guys have this.  It's like a 33 minute video of a closed sales call I did back in 2018.  That's going to be included for anybody that joins today as well.  OK, so anybody that stays at all is going to get the replay of this.  We're also going to be doing the giveaways.  We're going to be doing the training now.  And then anybody that joins, we're going to be giving away the  you're going to also get the sales, the sales recording that did back in 2018.  OK, rank and retired dot com.  Check it out. That is the rank and run academy.  And guys, with that said, let's get into the training.  Porter, what are you at right now per month?  I'm almost 11K, actually, right now.  Ten, one, ten, ten, one, ten, ten, ten, seven right now.  Amazing. OK, by the way,  we got to get you to 20 quick, just so you know.  Welcome, Dylan, first join.  So, Dylan, welcome to the community.  Welcome to Rankin Academy for being the first join.  I think, Ashley, we need to hook him up with something special.  So, Ashley, why don't you send him some swag?  Let's send him some swag out of the deal store  since he was the first one to make the leap.  Welcome, Dylan.  So let's get into the training, guys.  I want to I want to give you guys some real value as I go out here.  Last live, it's one twenty five in the morning.  It's been a long three days.  I've been working my tail off.  I'm in the middle of West Africa.  I should be going and enjoying nature and checking all this kind of stuff out.  I've just been working because I wanted to get this thing launched  as soon as possible.  So let's get into this this training and then we'll do the giveaways. OK.  So, guys, here's what I did this training.  We're going to be talking about how to go from zero to 20K per month  in 2025 with digital real estate.  And that's if I had to start over today.  So if you told me, hey, Nick, you know, you're at zero.  Like you're literally at no money.  I'm going to take everything away.  I'm going to take away all your clients.  You can't call your old clients.  What would you do?  And I sat there when I was preparing this, which I've spent a lot of time  just preparing this this part right here.  And I thought, what would I really do if I was sitting,  let's say, with Porter and he asked me this question?  What would actually what I do?  Not what what sounds good. What would I do?  So before I get into it, I've got like a few things.  I just want to I'm going to buzz through them.  And then any questions you guys have, we're going to we're going to go into that, too.  Porter, if you were to do that today,",

    "pageContent": "let's say you were going from zero to 10K.  Everything taken away.  You know, obviously, your skill set, your knowledge is there,  but all your clients are taken away.  What's the very first thing you would do? Just curious.  I would set my goals.  I would map out how many.  Well, I pick one niche, first of all, or two niches,  because I think simplicity is best.  I would I would set my goal and figure out  how many campaigns I needed to run every single month  and how many closing calls I would need to do every single month  to make sure it happens with a little bit of a buffer.  And then I would just simplify it.  I would just completely simplify the whole process.  Just pick one or two niches just to scale it and not try to overcomplicate it.  I love it, dude. I love it. Keep it simple.  Real quick, I got my comments over here on the phone.  Not to jump, but actually keep track of this.  Isaac Cheatham, he needs a coffee cup.  He needs a coffee cup.  He's one of the swag winners. Done.  Give him a coffee mug, man.  Give Isaac Cheatham a coffee mug.  Thanks for asking, brother.  And now everyone's going to ask for a coffee mug.  But Isaac, first winner of the swag.  OK, I like that, dude.  I like that. Sounds sounds simple.  And guys, I don't ever think you want to overcomplicate this.  So I'm going to go through what I would do,  and then I'm going to kind of set it back on Porter as well.  By the way, if you guys don't know, Porter isn't just on here because he's my brother.  He's on here because he's at 10.  You said 10, what, 10, 7?  Yeah, 10, 700 now.  Ten thousand seven hundred dollars a month.  He's also working on the farm.  When I talked to him today, we're doing WhatsApp.  He was actually doing farm stuff in the middle of making calls.  Like, even though he does that part time, he does it full time in the summer.  And then I feel like part time.  I feel like this year you've worked more than you did.  Even last year.  Oh, yeah, by far.  And I've done way better. It's crazy.  Yeah, I feel like you just do better when you're it's honest.  It's the truth.  So here's what I would do, guys.  Step number one, if I was starting from zero, zero to 20K.  Step number one is and this may sound like I'm going from the very beginning  or I'm going a bit back, but this is literally I would do this before anything.  Number one is I would figure out why I wanted the 20K. OK.  Why? Why? Like, why do I actually want to make 20K?  And I know it sounds silly, whatever.  But for me, when everything everything changed for me in 2020.  Because in 2019, I sat down with a pen and a paper and I asked myself,  what do you want? Number one, which I said, 100K a month.  And then I asked the most important question, which was why?  And I answered, why do I want that?  And then that answer, I asked why again, and I went like seven layers deep.  And guys, I can tell you when I figured out exactly why I wanted that money,  I",

    "pageContent": "realized that it wasn't even the reason that I originally thought.  But every time that, you know, things got tough or I got tired or whatever  it was, it was Wednesday.  I just it was easy to remember my wife.  And I was very clear about it.  So if I was starting today, before I did anything, before I chose my niche,  before I chose my city, before I map my goals, first thing I'm doing  is I'm sitting down going, why do I want 20K?  What what what do I need? 20K?  Why is it not 25? Why is it not 30?  Why is it not 15? What's the 20K for?  Why is it important to me?  And that's the first thing I do.  OK, step number two, guys.  Again, and this is coming from somebody who went from  barely making like barely scraping by eight to 10K a month back in 2019.  To in July of 2020, doing a hundred thousand dollars per month.  And some of these are the same steps.  And some of this I didn't do, which I wish I would have.  OK, step number two for me would be eliminate everything from my life  that doesn't get me closer to that goal.  And the goal being 20K.  I heard her Mosey her Mosey say this, I watched it.  I don't I haven't watched a ton of his stuff in the last year,  but I did watch something recently and he said he said this and it stuck with me.  And I've shared it in digital landlords as well.  It says, ask yourself the following question every single time this year.  Does this and guys, write this down.  This isn't from me.  This is from somebody that's way smarter, way richer, way more business savvy.  And I love this question.  Does this thing, person or belief  make it less or more likely that I hit my goal?  Anything you do, anything you do,  getting ready to go out with the boys and hit some drinks.  Does this thing, person, belief make it more or less likely that I hit my goals?  OK. Getting ready to go on a vacation midweek.  Same question. Getting ready, you know, whatever it is.  Ask yourself that lunch that you got invited to.  Is it getting your close?  Is it getting you closer to your goal?  Is the belief getting you closer to your goal?  Is the is the person that you're around getting you closer to your goal?  If not, cut it.  OK, if you assuming that you want to hit the goal,  that would be the plan here, right, is I want to hit the 20K.  OK, step number three for me, guys, is then I would sit down  and I would set the date and create an exact roadmap for how to get there.  Now, I will say this inside of the RankinRant Academy  in the map your goals section.  That's exactly what I walk through of how to set that exact date, target  and how to how to create that map of how to get there.  And I'm not just talking about like a loose map.  I'm talking, OK, I want to break it down by quarter, month, week, day, everything.  How many deals am I going to need to close?  How many people am I going to need to pitch to get that many pitches? Right.  Sorry, how many people am I going to need to pitch to close that many deals?  How many business owners am I going to need to put on trial to get that",

    "pageContent": "many pitches  all the way down to how many due diligence am I going to need to actually do? OK.  That would be steps.  I think that was step three, right? Step three.  Step four, by the way, for those of you that are trying to scribble,  just stay to the end. I'll extend you to replay.  OK, step number four is I would pick.  I know I've told you guys in the past, pick one.  I would pick three boring, tried and true niches  that I was going to focus on exclusively.  I would just out the gate, pick three.  You know, and if I was going to start today without saying anything else,  Porter, if you're going to start today, what are the three niches you'd pick?  I know one of them is fencing.  Fencing, concrete and masonry.  There you go.  So from somebody who is really trying to get it this year,  who's really trying to get to your goals, 25K by the end of the year.  Yeah, and I've gotten two niches and most of them are concrete.  Most are concrete.  He's getting you're in concrete and fencing.  Yeah, homies at ten thousand seven hundred dollars a month.  He's in two niches.  One of them, you guys think, is oversaturated.  It is it is harder than it was.  Fencing is a great one.  Masonry is a great one.  OK, there's a lot of good niches go into three.  So I would go and pick three boring, tried and true niches  that I was going to focus on exclusively. OK.  Step five is I would go and I would set.  Well, you know, this is a step that you don't have to do.  But the next step is the due diligence process, where what I would do  is I would go in and crank out as many due diligence as I could possibly find  as I could possibly do.  I will tell you guys this just to give a little plug  for the rank and rent engine tool is knowing what I know now.  I would immediately go and fricking set up an account with rank  and rent engine just for the due diligence,  because you're going to be able to do due diligence in seven minutes  instead of 30. And you can do due diligence.  You can do four in a time.  You could do one and you can crank out way more due diligence.  So for me, knowing what I know now, I'd go set up an account.  I'd get the discount code.  It's like 69. What is it?  69 bucks for the starter pack for the first two, three months.  If you get the discount code and you can crank out due diligence like that.  And what I would do, guys, is I would go  and I would find my first five niche and city combinations.  OK, I'd find my first five.  Now, I know I'm deviating a little bit from what I've maybe said in the past.  And by the way, those of you that are that are in digital landlords.  I am in the middle of finishing the training 3.0.  This is the third time I'm going to be creating the new version of digital landlords.  But I'm in the middle of that.  So there's going to be some minor changes.  But I would go and I would find my first five niche and city combinations.  One of the reasons you can do that is because you have tools  like rank and rent engine where you can just bust out due diligence.  OK, now this is one thing I want to I",

    "pageContent": "did not do this.  And I really strongly encourage you guys to do this.  Is if I was starting again today, from this point on, I would record everything.  OK, loom Vimeo recording tool.  And I think it's on Google Chrome Store.  Porter, what do you use to record stuff?  A snapshot snapshot.  So it doesn't matter whatever you want to use, record everything.  Why? Because I'm going to hand this off to my VA as soon as possible.  And I can tell you guys in advance, due diligence is one of those things  you are going to want to hand off as soon as possible.  Once you master it, once you get good at it, you're going to want to get somebody else  to be putting in those hours.  OK, so, guys, yes, go find those five niches.  You can do it by hand. By the way, you don't have to use a tool.  Use frickin paper. I don't care.  But record exactly how you're doing the due diligence so that you have a PDF.  I'd have a PDF and I have videos on each one of those steps.  Because then I can hand it off to a VA.  OK, guys, I'm trying to get to 20K.  I'm not trying to get a deal.  I'm not trying to get one deal. I'm trying to get to 20K.  And I think you guys should.  And the reason I chose 20K for this presentation is because at 20K,  most everyone's out of the rat race, right?  I see people on here. I recognize they have all kinds of jobs  for everything from, you know, whatever.  Some people are business owners.  Some people work. They're teachers.  Some people are doctors, whatever it is, guys.  But. At the end of the day,  just just trust me on this one, guys, just record everything.  OK, just record everything.  And at 20K, you can almost anyone can get out of the rat race.  OK, that's that's really what I'm trying to say.  OK, so once I did that, guys, I found my first five  niche city combinations and I recorded everything.  Then what I would do is I would go and set up not one, not two.  I'd go set up three Google ad campaigns.  For three of those five cities, I've chosen five  niche and city combinations.  I'd pick three of them and I'd go set up three campaigns.  And then I would out of those three, I would choose the best two  and I would turn to one.  OK, I turn to one.  And then what I would do is as soon as one started to hit,  I would pause the other.  So now I got one going.  I got two ready to rip ones, pause ones hasn't been started yet.  And I got my first three pop, pop, pop.  OK, done. Just like that.  OK, now, again, guys, which this is one of those things  where I'm telling you what I would do now.  The reason I do it like this is because I know that once I get that first deal,  what everyone does is, Porter, this happened to you.  You got your first deal and then you're like, oh, back to the drawing board.  Now I got to go do due diligence.  And it kind of like slowed you down.  Yeah, I didn't have a plan.  I landed a deal and then I had to go back.  And it took me weeks and weeks and weeks.  And this was I should have been",

    "pageContent": "more prepared. Amazing.  So guys, again, record this record how you're setting up ads.  OK, you might not want to hand off ads right at the back.  Like, I don't want to trust a VA.  Just record it because you're going to at some point not going to say  because I don't I haven't set up ads personally in years.  And I'm the one that pays for them.  OK, I have somebody I trust.  Francesca sets them up.  And guess what? I don't even think she sets them up anymore.  I think she oversees somebody else to set them up.  So you're going to have to let the stuff out of control, guys.  I didn't record this stuff for years.  I was doing I was the only one then finally like, oh,  there's this book called The E Myth.  It says I should should create a system.  And then I started I'm just a knucklehead.  I'm trying to give you guys the shortcut here.  OK, so, guys, once I did that, I got the campaign running campaigns running.  I I would then go and build out my list for that city.  OK, now, if you've never done this before,  I would probably recommend that you build the list first  before you even decide to set up the ad.  So, you know, there's business owners.  But for me, because I've done this so many times,  I know what I'm looking for.  I can I can eyeball it and know, you know, hey, this  this has got enough business owners.  And for me, to be honest with you, if I see that there's three business  owners that are paying for ads for me, that's enough.  OK, because I'm really, really confident I'm going to close the deal.  And I know how to show them all the other work I've done, et cetera.  Now, in this scenario, I wouldn't be able to show them that.  But again, guys, I would then go build my list.  If you've never done this before, I'd probably do the list before. OK.  So, guys, now this is where I'm going to change a little bit  from what I've said in the past.  After I built the list, we got the campaign running.  We got to pause campaigns.  We got one one running.  And then the next that we're building, we build the list. Right.  So then, guys, this is where I deviate just a little bit.  What I would do while we're waiting for the ads for the ads to work,  the leads to come in, is I would go and of those two remaining campaigns. OK.  Whatever one is the lowest hanging fruit  with the lowest hanging fruit, like with the city niche combination,  I would actually recommend if I was getting to going to going to go to 20K,  I would actually recommend going and just building your first website.  So while you're waiting, you got, again, just to recap,  you got one that's running ads.  You're waiting for leads to come in.  Of course, leads come in. Focus on that.  You got that. You got to pause ready to rip as soon as you're good.  Then these remaining two, I'd choose one of the two.  I'd actually go build a website.  I've never said that in the past, but I'm starting to realize  that I think a good agency, you've got your you've got your ads.  Those are your quick deals that you're going to go snipe.  And then whenever you come across those",

Once you close that first deal, you can always run ads to that website.  Now, you got to be careful.  You want to make sure that you're you know what the due diligence looks like.  I would make sure that the one that you build is the one  that's the lowest hanging fruit, because once you build it,  you're kind of stuck with it.  But if you're confident in it, go and build this. Why?  Because now I've got ads running.  I've got to pause.  And I've also got one that's now starting to rank.  And I can be doing work on this while I'm waiting for the leads coming.  I know a lot of people.  They get in.  They set up a campaign and they're like, what do I do now?  What do I do now?  And it's like, well, you go do more due diligence.  Well, I already told you to do five.  Right. So this is a good use of time.  And now, guys, you're going to go build out the website.  And guess what? While you're building out the site,  you know what you're going to do?  You're going to go and you're going to freaking record it.  Right. So you can hand it off to a VA.  Follow me so far.  I got four more things and I'm done. OK, guys, after that,  what I would do is once, of course, I'm sitting here.  The main target is to wait for the leads to come in.  Once the leads start to come in for that first city,  I'd go and I'd close a deal using my process.  If you guys don't know my process by now,  it's because you're brand new to the group.  Go into the Rankin Red Academy.  We outline the entire process in the Money, Love, Speed module.  I would use the my process to close my first deal,  even if it took me three tries.  OK, meaning even if I got leads coming in, I hooked a business owner.  I sent three to five leads.  I got them on the phone. I flubbed the deal. I lost it.  I had to do it again and again, even if it took me three,  even if it took me four or five tries.  We have a guy today inside of our community,  inside of Digital Landlords.  And that kind of a similar thing happened to him.  I think he went through a couple of business owners,  but he had spent a couple of hundred bucks on ads.  But he kept going. He kept going. He got the deal.  Guys, you don't lose money  until you quit running the ads, until you just decide to give up.  OK, so I would again.  That's the main thing.  What's different about what I'm giving you with this approach, guys,  is I already know what's going to happen is if you get that first deal,  you're focusing on one campaign.  Then as soon as you get that deal, you're going to go back to the due diligence.  And it's just like it's it's just this thing.  We're trying to get to 20K as soon as possible.  OK, so I would go, I would close that deal.  I would record every step of the process.  Guys, I'm building out a library for my company handbook.  OK, and then, guys, as soon as I land that first deal,  I just recoup my costs and I would",

I would go to onlinejobs.ph  and I'm spending the first money that comes in to get a VA.  No questions asked.  All that stuff, due diligence,  fricking building websites, all that crap that I don't want to do.  I'm I've now got a library of stuff that I've trained them.  That I've I've got these videos on.  I'm just handing this stuff off, man.  I'm not dealing with it. I don't want to deal with it.  I'm trying to get to 20K.  I'm not. Again, the difference between what I'm talking about now,  some of you guys have heard me talk about getting that first deal going,  having a goal of getting to 20K is you're going to structure it differently  than if you have a goal of one K of one deal. Right.  And a lot of people don't think about this,  but this is how I'd get to 20K as soon as possible. OK.  So I'm going to get that VA that first one.  No questions asked.  Don't take the money and start, you know, go go buy clothes.  Put it into a VA recoup your costs on the ads, put it into a VA  and let them go buy back your time.  OK, now what I do is I turn my VA loose on my library  and then I train that person and have them start cranking due diligence  and to also to go build that first website that I that I sold. Right.  So they're going to just be churning out due diligence.  Everything, not everything.  This is when everything changed. But guys,  do before ranking an engine,  how long did it take you to do a due diligence?  It took me like 30 to 45 minutes because I had to go back and forth  and back and forth. It took forever.  I can open up like 15, like 10 to 15 minutes.  Like and I've done it like a couple of times.  Like I could do a lot faster if I did it more. Yeah.  For me, 30 minutes is about what it was.  So imagine I've done over personally over a thousand.  Well, I don't know how much how much time have I spent. Right.  Imagine you can go and get a VA using your rank and rent  engine account and they can bust one out.  Let's say they're not as fast as you.  Let's say there are 12 minutes of rip. Right.  They're they could do almost three.  Let's see. 12. So what they're doing five.  They could do five an hour.  You say four hours a day.  So five times four, you can do 20 a day.  You could do. I mean, dude, you can crank out some due diligence.  You can have them attack some cities. Right.  And so now all of a sudden they're doing due diligence.  They've got a list of these cities.  You're going in, you're making sure that they're good.  And guys, as you close the deal, guess what?  You're turning on the other campaign. Right.  And then that other website, you're setting up the ads.  And now you've got a whole list to do.  And it's just this rinse and repeat cycle.  And the issue is, is everyone's thinking about that.

    "pageContent": "Right.  But if we're trying to get to 20K, we've got to we've got to be  going to plan it on 20K.  And that's why I started off by saying set the target,  create the road map and then attack. OK.  And guys, that is exactly the process  that I'm going to be doing until I hit 10K.  I'm going to rinse and repeat, rinse and repeat, rinse and repeat.  And then when I hit 10K, then I think around 10K  I'm as when I would probably go get my second VA.  You could probably justify it earlier,  but you could get to 10K with a VA and yourself  and a simple tool like Rank and Rent Engine.  That's all you need. OK.  You get to 10K.  And then, guys, what my last step would be, as soon as I hit 10K,  I'd get a second VA.  I would have every single thing that's not making me more money.  I would have my VA's doing.  I'd be managing two VA's.  I'd be spending my time hooking business owners,  sending over leads and closing deals. That's it.  I've had them building websites, writing content, doing due diligence,  setting up ads, every single thing except for doing the sales.  And I would rinse and repeat until I hit 20K.  OK. Now, for those of you like, oh, man,  I wish I would take more notes again.  Guys, if you're in 13 minutes, I'm going to be giving away.  Everyone's going to get the replay of this.  You guys go listen to this again.  This is how I would freaking attack it.  By the way, for those of you that did that just hopped on  and have no idea what we're talking about,  just a spoiler alert.  The free group's gone.  All the content's gone.  Rankandretire.com. Go check it out.  You can rewatch this if you want.  But for those, I know we've got a bunch more people that jumped on.  Rankandretire.com. It's pinned at the top.  Go check it out.  That is our community.  That is the Rank and Rent Academy. OK.  So a couple of notes real quick, notes to some giveaways.  Guys, you plus one to two VA's,  you can muscle your way to 20K.  That's insane, right?  Porter, how much you pay your VA?  Well, a hundred dollars a week.  So four hundred bucks a month.  I think I have one VA that pay five hundred bucks a month.  I think I have my guy here in Africa.  It's been with me for like five years.  I pay him three hundred bucks a month.  I mean, imagine, right?  You plus two people, that's less than a thousand dollars in payroll.  You could scale to 20K a month.  That's freaking insane.  What other business, right?  OK, when I scale, let me tell you guys this, guys,  when I scaled to 100K per month, this is what my team looked like.  It was me.  Francesca was overseeing the sites and the clients.  There was one guy helping me hook business owners.  There was one guy answering and transferring leads.  And then I had one and a half because one of them was part time,  one and a half paid by the thousand words content writer.  And I had two VA's. OK, so what is that?  Like five people.  One,",

Like my payroll was nothing  and it was a million dollar company.  OK, seven figure agency.  Now, last thing I want to cover,  what what kind of time frame would I be looking at for this 20K?  I if I were actually doing this for real,  I would set a die goal of six months, like I'll hit six months no matter what.  But I would set a stretch goal of three months.  I think you could set a goal if you really, really eliminated all the  distractions, you put your head down and went to work.  And this is all you focused on.  I think you could do it in three months.  OK, I think you could.  You'd really have to push.  But I think if you wanted to, you could do it in three months.  Now, somebody is going to quote me and say,  oh, you said I could get to 20K in three months.  No, I said that if you put your head down and you freaking nailed it,  you could. But no, most people aren't going to do that.  OK, that is, guys, the my.  That's what I would do.  You guys ever heard you,  Porto, have you heard that show called Undercover Boss, Grant Cardone?  Yeah. He got dropped in frickin what?  Somewhere in Colorado. You should know.  Frickin was a boulder.  I think it was Boulder with like a hundred bucks.  And he's supposed to create like whatever business.  That would be my if you said today you got no money.  You got to get a twenty thousand dollar business in three months.  That's it right there.  That's what I'm doing every second of every day.  I'm waking up and I'm cranking it out, baby.  I'm putting in my headphones, listen to a little  focus music on Spotify and just, you know,  maybe throwing in a couple of press ups every couple of hours.  That's it, dude. Just cranking away on the computer.  You can build guys.  I wish I could hold up my laptop with a laptop,  internet connection and some knowledge you guys can build.  You guys can escape the frickin rat race. Right.  Those of you that are on this call right now that had to go to work today  that hated every second of it.  And you're like, I can't wait for that live to see if there's a way  I can do it. You can.  You can. You just got to put in the work. Right.  And we have literally the model and the and I just gave you guys  literally a an exact game plan for how to do it.  Now you just got to execute. OK.  So, guys, once again, for those of you that didn't catch it,  rank and retire dot com, if you guys love the free group  and you want to continue it, that is what that's transition to.  It is paid. It's and you know what?  Again, I don't care if we go from six thousand.  I don't care. By the end of the week, we go from six thousand  two hundred people in the free group.  And I only have fifteen people inside of that community  because those fifteen people are the ones I want to work with.  Those are the people I'm going to give my time to my attention to.  Those are the ones that want to work because they're putting",

Jahill says any hoodies available, the hoodies.  It's not because I don't want to give away.  It's because the hoodies are for it's the 10K club.  So if you see somebody rocking a hoodie, they're in the 10K.  So other than that, I would have I would have said yes.  OK, so let's go.  Carl. So, Ashley, I need you to be taking notes here.  Carl Giambri says he wants free stuff.  So let's do for him, let's give him a mouse pad.  OK, let's also do.  Jen's Linton.  Let's do a mouse pad.

Again, guys, if you won, if I called your name, message Ashley,  she'll get you taken care of. We got this.  Then we're going to give away.  We're going to tell you guys about the partial scholarship.  We're going to wrap it up and we'll we'll go get back to work.  OK, yeah, guys, don't leave it on Ashley.  She's writing it down.

There's no way I'm going to be able to sleep tonight.  I love it.  Yeah, dude, you boy got dressed up today.  All right, guys, let's talk about the partial scholarship.  Just real quick.  We're going to talk about the partial scholarship.  All right, guys, let's talk about the partial scholarship  just real quick, just so that when the winner is chosen,  no one's like, oh, it's not this isn't an entire scholarship.  It's a partial scholarship.  So you are going to get a partial scholarship.  That's what it means. OK, here's what we're going to do,  because we don't know necessarily who's applied in the past, whatever.  So this is what we found to be the easiest thing as we discussed it.  If you are interested in the partial scholarship,  need you to do two things. OK,  I need you to send the following to Francesca on a message.  If you send it to me, we're not going to see it.  Send it to Francesca Ravinelli, our Italian stallion from Frickin.  I think she's from Trento, Italy.  She is amazing. She does all of the stuff for my agency.  She's responsible",

Number one is what you do for work right now.  It's a business. If it's a job, what the job is, whatever.  Just tell her what you do for work.  And number two, why you think you deserve the partial scholarship.  OK, that's it.  And I will tell you that I will let her decide.  I'm going to let her read all of them.  She's going to be able to.  I'm going to give her the the complete autonomy to decide based on the answers.  Who is the winner of the partial scholarship?  She will reach out to you. We'll announce it to just so everyone knows  that we actually did choose a winner.  She'll reach out to you, let you know you on the partial scholarship.  For me, just to choose someone randomly.  And then if, you know, they've already applied or whatever,  it just didn't make sense. It's kind of a waste of time.  So if you guys are interested in the partial scholarship,  digital landlords, partial scholarship and go message Francesca  and tell her what you do for work and why you think you're deserving of it. OK.  So, guys, with that said one more time, for those of you that are new,  just getting on the call, let me get some water here.  The free group, the art of pre-selling,  as it was formerly known right now, called the Art of Digital Real Estate  is no more. All of the training, all of me going live  150 plus times are done. They're gone.  It's done. It's over. It was fun.  We had a great ride.  No one appreciates what they don't pay for.  If you are interested in still being part of the community  and what it has evolved to in version 2.0, if you are not in digital lands,  if you're in digital landlords, you're not going to pay for it.  We're going to try to sort out how we get you guys all in there.  So don't worry. You're going to have access to everything.  If you're not in digital landlords, go to rankandretire.com.  You can also go to school.com SKOL and search for Rank and Rent Academy.  Either way, go check it out.  I've got a about little blurb on about.  There's a video, a nine minute video that explains a little bit more into.  Excuse me, bud, a little more into what we cover in there.  But guys, people that pay for stuff, they value it more.  And I'm telling you right now, I do not care about the numbers.  I don't care if there's three, two, one person, ten people, fifteen.  I don't care if we go from six thousand two hundred down to ten.  Does not matter because I know those ten people. I'm stoked.  I'm going to mess it.  We're going to you're going to get a very personal feel for me.  And for those of you that are wondering,  what's the difference between digital landlords and  Rank and Rent Academy, the new community, everything.  OK, just like the free group and the digital landlords, everything.  However, I will tell you, there's all new training inside of the Rank and Rent Academy.  We've got a bunch of stuff that we didn't have before.  And we are going to be loading every single live that I ever did.  Ever in the free",

Rank and Rent Academy, Rank and Retire dot com.  Check it out. Now, what I want to do, Porter, you got ten minutes.  Yeah, we're good. Since this is our last call,  I want to just I want to see if anyone has any final questions.  Ten minutes. I'm going to give ten minutes any questions.  Maybe we'll give away a little more swag.  I don't know. But if anybody has questions, I want to just answer them.  I really, really, really.  I hope you guys know I really poured my heart and soul into this community.  I have spent so many freaking hours just just commenting,  just answering questions, just reading posts.  I don't know if you guys know of any other free communities out there  that had paid admins.  OK, fix it.  Felix was not a free, but it was somebody I paid somebody  on my personal team that I paid every week to go and service the free group.  We put a lot in that, man.  I put so many hours in that and it was a back and forth, back and forth.  Should we get rid of it? Should we not?  Guys, I wish we didn't have to get rid of it.  It was it was amazing.  It was such a good thing.  But all good things come to an end, just like when you give a business  owner free leads and they stop.  They think they can do it on their own or they stop appreciating it.  It kind of loses its sizzle.  It lost its sizzle, man.  It was it was a great run.  But let's go build an amazing community.  Let's go build the rank and run academy.  For those of you that are actually serious about learning this model  that want to go to the next level, I'll see you in there.  OK, let's see if there's any questions really quick.  Eight minutes. We're done. OK.  All right.  Pat says, if you're sending ads.  To a B.O.  And you fail to land the deal, what do you do with the ad campaign?  What do you do, Porter?  If I failed, read it one more time.  You're running you're sending ads to a B.O.  And you failed to land the deal.  What do you do with the ad campaign?  I find I find another business owner from getting leads  and I didn't sell the first business owner.  I'll go and try to find another business owner.  And most likely, it was something that I did.  It's not the area.  So don't give up on the area.  If you're getting leads, keep trying.  There's always an option to find a business owner.  Yep. Same same exact answer.  I knew I figured you'd answer like that.  So I said that, by the way, Chandler Christensen, how do we get the replay?  I would love to just post a link right now because  it would be the easiest thing, but we're still recording the replay, unfortunately.  So what you're going to have to do is anybody that wants it.  You're going to message Ashley.  Actually, I",

Carl says you talked about running ads and then building out a site.  We're starting with a small site, then transitioning to move to a permanent site after you.  Yeah. So that's what you do is you start out with a you start out with a landing page.  You run the ads through landing page, you get the deal, then you build up the site.  What I was telling you, if I was going to go to 20K, I would that would be my primary focus.  But I'd also try to go for my my most low hanging fruit project or due diligence.  And I would build that one out so I can get I could have one project  ranking while I'm running ads and landing deals.  OK, because I want to have both.  Right. I've started to realize, like, as an agency, you want to have all kinds of different stuff moving.  OK. Matthew says, no questions, been binging your podcast and learned a ton,  thinking about applying, but not sure on cost.  We'll think it over. No problem.  Matthew, send me a message.  Actually, you know what, Matthew, by the way, anybody on this call,  that is has a question or that needs any further help.  Porter, are you down to do a couple of calls?  Yeah, I'm going to drop my phone number in the chat.  Drop. Porter's going to drop his phone number.  Matthew, you specifically message Porter, jump on a call with him and ask any questions  that you have and he'll answer for you. OK, so don't just do that.  And that's actually Porter's cell phone.

Let's say family, friends, friends that are really close to me.  Want to, you know, these are people that are really close to me.  Let's say family, friends.

But when you have skin in the game, even if it's a little bit of skin, you're like,  I'm going to get into this community.  I'm going to go freaking do the like you're going to go through the modules.  By the way, in the first mini course, it has some homework.  Do all the freaking homework.  Has you go drop while you're in the group, blah, blah, blah.  Go do all that.  But you're going to go watch all the mini courses.  You're going to go do all that stuff because you've you've paid to be there.  Right. Even if it's a little over a dollar a day, you're going to go freaking squeeze  that thing for what it's worth because you spent money on it.  OK. So, yeah, it's not because of you, Stephanie.  Jahill says you should call this live, the giant pullback.  That's a cool name, but it's not a pullback because we're actually ending the group.  No question. Just thank you, Ali.  Thank you for that comment.  Let's see.  OK, Kenneth says, thanks so much, Nick and team question.  How would you respond to a business owner saying, why don't you do ads  slash SEO on my website instead of building your own separate site that I don't own?  How would you convince them about the business model?  Kenneth, what I would say is I can.  I can do I do both.  But the reason I'm doing this is because it's going to be a lot more  affordable for you.  And the only reason you want me to do any work on your website  is because you want leads.  So if you want, I can go and do a bunch of stuff and send you a report,  whatever on your website is going to cost you a lot more.  And it's going to be a 12 month contract.  Or I can build my own website, get you what comes from the website,  which is leads, and you pay a lot less.  You're renting it for me.  So but yeah, and if you want to, I'll give you a price on it.  And I'll quote them super high.  And if they say yes to that, I'll just do that.  And then I'll still sell them a lead gen it later.  Never say no, there's always an option.  100 percent.  Porter's number four, three, five, three, nine, three, five, six, nine, four.  Everyone drop it into a spam filter, please.  Just not the insurance one to the marketplace.  We can smoke you.  Steve Wall, have you been seeing exact match domains  getting smacked this most recent Google update now?  Not really, but I'm not super spammy like that.  And I'm not saying that spammy, but if I did get an exact match domain,  I didn't do anything else that was spammy.  Kevin says, if we're in DLL course, Kevin, what it means is you're going to have access.  But listen, if you're in DLL, that's the advanced stuff.  That's where you want to be anyway.  So you think you're going to have access to this, but it's not.  It's not it.  You're going to want to stay in digital landlords where the values are.  So you're not you're going to again, free access for life.  You get all the value if",

Brandon says he also just joined yesterday.  Awful timing.  And Annie says, I've loved your podcast, said I don't have them anymore.  Oh, they're coming.  By the way, I recorded one on Saturday night here in Africa.  It was a 22 minute podcast and 18 minutes in the power went out, lost it.  OK, unfortunately, I haven't had a time this week at all  as I've been preparing for this live to record it.  But you're going to see them again.  So keep an eye on it. And he appreciate that.  Steve says he appreciates all the freebies.  Yeah, Isaac did say Isaac says Nick's been doing a pullback  warning about this for a year. Finally, I'm doing it.  Everyone thought I was lying.  Guys, I appreciate you being on.  Ma says bike away.  You're welcome, brother.  Steve says, so we wouldn't be buying a bike.  We wouldn't be buying a bike.  We wouldn't be buying a bike. We wouldn't be buying a bike.  We wouldn't be buying a bike. We wouldn't be buying a bike.  He says, so we wouldn't be buying both digital  landlords and the school group, or do you recommend them both?  Well, I know that question, guys.  This school is just the community is just like the free group, right?  It's not going to have every single thing that digital landowners are going to have.  It's not going to cover in depth.  It's a introduction to rank and rent.  It's a community. It's me going live.  It's it's it's got many courses.  It's got a vault with all the old stuff.  It is for all intents and purposes, the Facebook group  converted into a community.  But now, because I'm working with committed people,  I'm I'm ready to go at it again. I'm ready to come go live.  I'm ready to to give a ton of time, effort, energy,  throw a bunch of resources at it.  OK, digital landlords is like that's where you're going to end up.  When you're ready from school, you'll end up in digital landlords.  So if you're thinking about what should I do?  You definitely are going to want to do digital landlords.  The reason why we did school is because if you're brand new  and you want to check it out, you want to build the community, blah, blah, blah.  That's where that's at. OK.  But again, for those of you that didn't catch this,  if you're in rank and rent academy,  let's say for six months, 20 percent of the money that you spend  when you decide to join digital landlords is going to be credited  towards your membership  and you're going to get that discount off of digital landlords. OK.  Order anything else?  No, I would say, guys, if you join school,  you're going to get a message from me.  Reply back if you guys need help.  Feel free to message me.  I'd love to get on one on one calls with you.  And don't be thinking this is a sales call.  It's strictly to help you.  I already know eventually you're going to join digital landlords anyway.  So I'm not going to try to push that on you.  But I will give you the information that you need.  But again, reply",

    "pageContent": " For those of you that are like,  hey, the leads are a little bit slow,  whatever, whatever, whatever,  here's my go-to, this is what I like to do is,  during the first contract,  and I think I covered this last week,  if there's six-month contract,  I am doing a touch, a check-in with them  every single week during the first contract.  If it's six-month contract,  I am touching base with them 24 times, okay?  And of those 24 times, at least once a month,  I'm doing a Zoom call,  and we are going over the leads, okay?  We're gonna send them the leads,  I'm gonna say, hey, let's jump on a Zoom,  I'm gonna say, which one of these leads did you talk to?  Have you talked to Jack, did you talk to Mark,  did you talk to Zane?  Cool, did you schedule them for an estimate?  Awesome, did you give them a quote?  Great, did you follow up with the quote?  Beautiful, okay?  Okay, I sent you 20 leads and you gotta hold the two?  Well, Jack, how the fuck are you gonna make money?  How are you gonna make money  by talking to two people I'm sending you 20, okay?  So you have to do these soft touches.  So that's my advice, if things are a little bit slow,  things have been a little bit weird with the deal,  you're gonna have to be over,  you're gonna have to over-communicate.  I would recommend a touch every single week,  and then once a month,  I would be jumping on a Zoom call reviewing the leads.  But at the end of the day, even that,  that's just gonna buy you a little bit of time.  The short answer, the right answer,  if they don't make money, they will cancel,  and it might be tomorrow, it might be next month,  it might be next week, it might be in six months,  it might be in two years,  because they just don't keep track of their budget.  If the customer does not make money,  even if it's not your fault, they will cancel.",

    "pageContent": " All right, let's build a killer keyword list. Now, what does that mean? Why are we doing  this so early? I'm going to go over all of those things, but first of all, I want to  cover why we are taking the time at this stage of the game. All we've done at this point  is pick the niche, and if you haven't picked the niche, you pick a niche, and if you don't  know what to pick, pick concrete, okay, just to recap from our last lesson. But we've picked  the niche, you're like, why are we already doing the keyword list? Okay, so there's many  reasons to this, and I'm going to go over a couple of them, but guys, it's very, very,  very crucial that you stop what you're doing and you do this step. Don't just watch this  module, or sorry, don't just watch this lesson, watch this lesson and do what I'm asking,  okay? All right, so why does this matter? Why does it matter to have our keyword list  dialed in? And what I mean by that is these are the keywords that we're going to be targeting  for our SEO, for our ads, for everything within that niche. So let's just assume that we're  doing concrete, because I've said if you don't know what to do, you're going to do concrete.  So the number one thing, the first thing that I think you need to understand is that in  order for us to run ads, which is going to be part of this game, now for some of you  that already have sites that are producing leads, this process works just the same and  you're going to use your leads that are already coming in organically, that's fine. But for  everybody else that wants to pre-sell and is just starting, and this niche is starting  from scratch, you are going to need to run ads, okay? That's how we're going to speed  this deal up. And as such, we're going to have to set up keyword themes, or we're going  to have to pick our keyword inside of our ads. So what keywords do we pick? Well, if  we do the keyword list correctly from the beginning, that becomes very simple, okay?  Also, what kind of ad copy do we want to include? Well, we're going to want to include some  keywords into our ad copy. So, you know, it's very, very crucial. The second thing, so number  one is we're going to need these keywords for the ads. Number two, remember that the  long-term game here, unless you're somebody who's just going to come in and, you know,  sell, and by the way, you could do this, but if you're somebody that's going to come in  and sell a deal for a thousand bucks a month, run $500 in ads and just take the difference  and never build out a website, that's totally fine. But I completely, completely, completely  recommend that once you do that and you get the deal, you then take the money from the  deal and build out the actual website. And when you build out the actual website, you're  going to need to know what kind of content to write. And you're going to want to look  at your keywords for that. And you're going to want to know what H1 tags, and we're going  to, by the way, if you have questions on this, we're going to get into that. It's fine. But  if you want to know what type of, you know, heading to use, you want to know what to put  as your page title and your meta description and what to name your images, it all ties",

    "pageContent": " back to the keyword list. Okay. So it's super, super, super crucial that you spend the time  to do this correctly. Also, guys, one thing that I made a huge mistake, and you've heard  me talk about having to get rid of 125 sites. One of the things I made a huge mistake with  is when I was doing my due diligence, my market research, whatever you want to call it, I  used to just use one keyword. So if I was doing concrete, I would go type in concrete  Orlando Florida, and I would look at the metrics and I would base it on one keyword. Okay.  And guys, if you base a decision on one keyword, you are rolling the dice, man. It's like going  and buying a piece of real estate and literally basing it off of one thing, basing it off  what the rents are. That's like, okay, well, the rents are 2000 bucks a month. Great.  That's not looking at how much capital expenditure you're going to need into the roof. It's not  looking at HOA fees. It's not looking at, you know, is that a desirable area? Is the  area growing? It's like looking at one factor of a real estate deal and putting money down.  That's the same as using one keyword to analyze a deal. Okay. So I did this incorrectly and  I didn't know what I was doing. So we're going to take this keyword list and we are going  to use at least five of the keywords that we, that we derive from this keyword list  to analyze the deal. So you need to make sure this is done correctly. Okay. I'm telling  you, this is so, so important. I've done this the wrong way and it is a nightmare.  All right, guys, the cool part about this too is you only have to do this once per niche.  So if you're going to do concrete, you do this correctly. You do it once. Now, if you  build five, 10, 15 more concrete sites, you don't have to keep doing it over and over  you just need to build a keyword list once. Okay. And what I'm going to do is I'm going  to show you guys an example of what happens when you don't do this correctly. You don't  look at the keyword research. You don't analyze the competition correctly because you only  look at one keyword. And I'm going to show you what happens. All right, guys. So I went  into this niche called foundation repair and I will tell you right now, this is one of  those niches that is very high ticket. I thought it was going to be a home run. It ended up  being, oh my gosh, I don't even want to get into, I spent a lot of money thinking I was  going to just crush it in this niche. But that's neither here nor there. What I wanted  to show you is this site has been live for, I kid you not, multiple years. We've been  running SEO on this site and it hasn't been done perfectly. But typically based on the  way that I now teach it and the way that I now pick cities and niches, even without doing  much, I would be ranking or I would at least be close to ranking. And I'm showing you right  now at the time of recording, this site has been live for at least three years. At least  three years. And for the main term, I am literally sitting on page five. I am literally sitting  on page five. In fact, this is a website that's on my list. I need to just cut this website.  This is not going anywhere. It's not doing anything. So if",

    "pageContent": "nothing else, guys, this should  be a great example of why you have got to make sure to do this keyword list correctly  so that you don't make these mistakes. All right. So guys, how do we actually build the  keyword list? So what I would recommend is I like to either get a piece of paper, pull  up a document, whatever. You can use a Google doc. It doesn't matter. You can use a note,  a sticky note. It does not matter. But the first thing that we're going to do is we're  going to use a tool. And it doesn't matter what tool you use. I just want you to use  the same tool every time you do this. So whatever you decide to choose, whatever you decide  to go with, use that again and again and again. Don't be bouncing here and there and  everywhere and using different tools because we want to keep this consistent. So what we're  going to do is we're first going to choose a tool. Okay. And for this example, I'm going  to use SEMrush. Now with this product, there is a 14 or seven day trial. I don't know.  It is an expensive product. It's just something that I'm familiar with. And the person that  I learned from the beginning was using it. So it's something I'm familiar with and I'm  going to be able to teach this really quickly using SEMrush. Now there's other examples  or other options you can use. Ahrefs, Mangools, Google Keyword Planner is a great free tool  that I would definitely recommend using if you don't want to spend money. For the sake  of this example, I'm going to use SEMrush. Okay. So what we're going to do is we're going  to choose a tool and then we are going to go and we're going to find out within the  niche that you selected, we're going to find the 10 to 15 main most highly searched terms.  So for example, I'm going to show you and demonstrate here in a second with concrete.  Within concrete, there's a lot of things that people could search. They could search cheap  concrete. They could search how much does concrete cost. They could search concrete  contractors. They could search concrete patio. Which of those terms are the most highly searched  nationwide or in your country? If you're outside of the US, totally fine. Which of these terms  are searched most in your country? That's what we're going to do first. Okay. So I'm  going to show you an example right now. All right guys. So again, like I said, I'm going  to use SEMrush for this. I think it's SEM. It might be SEM. I don't know, but it's going  to be really, really simple. So if you're doing concrete and we're going to use this  example because I am assuming a lot of people are going to use, are going to go into concrete.  So you're going to start off with your tool, whether it's keyword plan or whatever. You're  going to just type in the main term, which is concrete. If you're using, if you're doing  spray foam installation, type in spray foam installation. If you're doing artificial grass,  type in whatever comes to mind. Artificial grass, fake grass, turf. Just type in something.  And what we're going to start doing is we're going to look at it. Okay, concrete. And we're  not going to add the city. We're not going to add any city because we haven't even got  to that point yet. But we're just going to type in the main term. So concrete. And I'm  going to look at this and go,",

    "pageContent": "okay, that's interesting. There's 110,000 searches. And  you could see this as keyword difficulty. Don't pay attention to this. It's not, it  doesn't matter right now. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to take that term. I'm  going to write it down. And then what I'm going to do is I'm going to start like looking  in these sections here for what would I would consider, uh, uh, they, they call them, um,  related. Sorry. I should just look at this related keywords. Okay. So concrete calculator,  you got to use your intuition as well because like concrete calculator, that's more of like  somebody that's looking to do their own project. So no concrete cowboy. No. So concrete contractors  near me. Okay. 40,000, 40.5 K. That's a good one. I'm going to write that one down. Okay.  And this is what we're going to do. And we're going to click on these and there's going  to be other ones that come up. Um, you know, and then we're also, okay, here's a good,  here's a good one. Concrete patio contractors. So we're going to kind of use our intuition.  So we're going to go through and first thing we're going to do is compile a list of the,  the main term and related terms. Okay. Another idea I want to share with you guys when you're  coming up with this, cause we need to go and get 10 to 15 terms is what you could do is  you could go to a really competitive city. So let's just use like, um, uh, let's use  Atlanta. So let's do concrete Atlanta, Georgia. Okay. And you can look at the top ranking  companies. All right. So for example, this is the top ranking company for this term,  Sudlow concrete. And you're going to use their site to generate ideas. So for example, concrete  contractors. Okay. That's interesting. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to type  in concrete contractors. I'm going to remove the near me and Oh, what do you know? 27.1  thousand. Boom. I'm writing that down. And then based on that, you can start looking  at the related keywords again. Right? Okay. We already wrote that one down. Now concrete  contractors. We're going to write that one down. Concrete contractor. That might be interesting  to write down. Right. And we're going to go back to their site. We're going to check  it out. Okay. Uh, we could look at top rated concrete contracts. I have done this niche  enough to know that's not, but that's something you could look at if you were just going into  the niche things you want to look at on the page is you want to look at, you know, their  service pages. There's, those are going to be the most highly searched terms. So for  example, um, uh, driveway repair could be interesting. I also know like just using my  intuition driveway repair, you know, it's probably going to be more high ticket, uh,  concrete patio. Let's just use that for an example. So I'll, I'll do one more example  and I'm just going to give you my list here. Concrete patio. Okay. Boom. 12.1 thousand.  So guys, and then look, stamped concrete patio. What I want you to first do is I want you  to make a list of 10 to 15 terms that are the most highly searched term in the niche  that you selected. Okay. All right, guys, I went ahead and just",

I'll explain that in  a moment. So this is my compiled list. I did 18 terms. Um, it's not, you know, it's, it's  not a hundred percent complete, but I I've done this enough to know these terms are really,  really good. So I got concrete contractor, concrete company, concrete driveway, and I  just have them listed here. Okay. So what you want to do is you want to have your list.  And by the way, I have this in base camp. Don't recommend this. Um, I just, I'm telling  you that so you don't go and think you need to get base camp. There's something we use  and it's just already in here, but it's not worth the money. Um, I'm telling you that  in fact, we got a free trial of this. And so that's why I'm still using it. Okay. So  what you're going to do is you're going to take your, your, let's call it 10 to 15 keywords.  And then what you're going to do from there is you're going to take, and you're going  to use your intuition and you're going to select five to 10. I prefer like seven being  the sweet spot. You're going to select five to 10 of these keywords closer to five than  10. In fact, I'm just going to tell you, do five top set. Okay. Five to seven of these  keywords. And I'm going to have you use your intuition and say, okay, would that keyword  be something I want to focus on because of, uh, it's high ticket. It's, you know, it's  not someone that's looking around like, for example, uh, conk, cheap concrete near me.  I don't want those leads. That's some cheap ass. I don't want that. Okay. So anyway, I  went ahead and these highlighted ones are the ones that I determined as, you know, they're  really interesting keywords to me. And so what we're going to do is pick those five  to seven and these are going to be what we call core keywords. Okay. So just to recap,  we're going to go in, we're going to pick, or we're going to go find the terms that are  most searched across the nation. Okay. Concrete concrete contractor, concrete company, concrete  driveway, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. From that list of 10 to 15 to 20, we're going  to select five to seven of those keywords. And here's the interesting thing. It's not  always based on the search volume. Cause if you look at the actual total volume, notice  how concrete repair has more volume than a lot of these terms are very similar volume  to some of these terms, yet it didn't make the cut, right? Because I know people looking  for concrete repair. Those are really small jobs. Okay. So you're going to pick those  top terms. Okay. And I didn't include that because I just decorative concrete kind of  goes with polished concrete, but it's, it's didn't, I didn't, I didn't include it. Okay.  And you're going to come up with what are called your core keyword list. Okay. That's  going to be five to seven keywords. Now what you're going to do from here is very simple,  but we're going to build what are called expanded core keyword list for each of these terms.",

That shouldn't  even be in there. Concrete specialist should not be in there. In fact, for the sake of  this, let me go ahead and just delete this. Um, that, that was not done by me. Um, yeah,  I don't actually know why that's in there. Okay. There's no volume. It's not a great  term. So just forget you ever saw a concrete specialist. Don't add it. Stupid term. Not  that much volume, not that great of a term. Okay. But here are the core keywords that  I chose. Okay. To build my expanded lists on. And this is all going to make sense. So  just stay with me. Okay. Concrete contractor, concrete company, stamp concrete, concrete  staining, concrete driveway, concrete patio, polished concrete. Okay. I actually did like  eight or nine of these. Um, but I recommend doing seven. I don't, I actually do not use,  um, I can tell you this because we just did a site recently. I don't use these, uh, decorative  concrete terms. They were just built because we, in the beginning we thought we were going  to do that. So something important to note about concrete, there is decorative side and  then there's the flat work side. And most of these people, they want flat work stuff.  So I would, I would err on that side. But what I'm going to show you is you're going  to pick your five to seven terms. If you want to do a couple more, that's totally fine.  It's just going to take you a little bit longer. Guys. So what we're going to do is we're going  to take those five to seven keywords, your core keywords, and we're going to build an  expanded keyword list. Okay. And so what we're going to do is very, very simple. You're going  to take your first term. Okay. So you're going to go over and take your first term  concrete contractor. Okay. You're going to come over here and you're going to type it  into Google. Okay. And then what you're going to do is you're going to scroll the bottom  and you're going to see these related searches and it's going to give you ideas. These are  things people are searching and I want you to use your intuition. Should this be added  to the list or not? So concrete contractor near St. George, Utah. I'm not going to do  that one because I don't even know if I'm going into St. George yet. We're just picking  the niche at this point. So no near Las Vegas. No concrete pouring near me. Maybe. Okay.  Maybe you would add that. Maybe not concrete contractor salary. No, that's going to pull  people looking for jobs. Okay. Residential concrete contract. That's a really good one.  I would add that to my list. Okay. And what you're going to do is you're going to take  that keyword and you're going to go over here and you're going to add it to your list. Okay.  And you guys don't overthink this. Don't overthink this. Okay. Con concrete contractor jobs. No.  Okay. Not doing that one. Concrete calculator. Probably not doing that one. That's probably  somebody looking to do a project themselves. Residential concrete contractors near me.  Yeah, we might, but it's getting a little long tail. So I don't know. Okay.

We're going to go concrete contractor. Okay.  And then we're going to start with the letter A. Okay. Type in A. Whoops. And you're going  to see, why is it caps? There we go. And you're going to look and see if there's anything  with A. Association? No. Atlanta? No. Aberdeen? No. No. It's a lot of, a lot of city stuff.  So no. Okay. Okay. B. No. A lot of cities. Business plan. Nope. C. Okay. Concrete contractor  contract. No. Cost. Concrete contractor cost. That's an interesting one. I'd add that to  my list. Concrete contractor companies near me. Add that to the list. Okay. I'm still  going to avoid the calculator. We're going to go D. No. No. E. Estimate. I'd probably  add that. Okay. F. Nothing. G. Lot of cities with this term. And you're going to do this  H. Okay. You're just going to keep doing this with every one of your course. You're going  to do this five times all the way through the alphabet. And for whatever reason with  concrete contractor, you're going to kind of get a lot of cities, but let's try and  change the term. Let's do concrete patio and let's go A. Okay. Now you can see there's  a lot less cities. So A. Alternatives. Probably not. Around window well. No. Against house.  Probably around pool. I'll probably add that one. Depending on where you're at. Right?  If you're in somewhere that doesn't have pools, like where I grew up, don't do that. Okay.  It's not going to be a good one. Concrete patio and fire pit. Maybe. Okay. B. Concrete  patio blocks. And you're just going to go through and you're going to just use your  intuition. You're going to grab the ones that make sense. Concrete patio backyard.

Concrete patio contractors.  Yes. Concrete patio cleaner. No. Concrete patio square foot. Maybe. But probably not.  Concrete patio coatings. Yes. Go to D.

You're going to, you know, for patio, you're going to first go to the bottom.  You're going to look at related. You're going to grab the related block. Heck no, Google.  You're going to look at the related. You're going to add those to the list. And then you're  going to do the alphabet game. You're going to go A through whatever with the term. So  concrete patio space. Okay. Concrete patio space in every letter of the alphabet. And  look at the auto fill suggestions.

If you don't want  to spend money, do Google keyword, Google keyword planner. I think that's what it's  called. Okay. Pick a tool and stick with that tool. Then you're going to go and you're going  to type in the main term. And from there, you're going to start building a list of 10  to 15 to 20 core keywords. Things that people, they're the most highly searched thing based  on what this tool tells you. Okay. From that list, you are then going to pick five to seven  core keywords. From those core keywords, you are going to build an expanded list on each  of those keywords. And you're going to do it by first typing it into Google and looking  at the very bottom at the related keywords and then going to Google and typing in the  keyword, pushing space and then the letter A and then looking at those automatic fills.  Hey, do any of these make sense? You're going to do that for every single letter of the  alphabet for all five to seven keywords. I know it sounds like a lot. I know that, but  guys, if you do this once and you do it correctly for concrete, you're never going to have to  do this. If you do 15 concrete sites, a hundred concrete sites, you will never have to do  this again. So it's worth doing and doing correctly. And I want to say this last thing.  Do not overthink this. Do not overthink this. Remember our goal is to go into cities and  niches with low competition. So even if we do this 75% correctly, we're going to win.

    "pageContent": " Dude, tell me about a deal that you've done,  a pitch you've been on, a Zoom close that you didn't close  and what the business owner said.  All right, so just so you know,  I've had five Zoom closes and I'm closed four of those.  So it's just been one.  Hey, all flex, all flex.  I like it, I like it.  Bro, you said you have to flex, so why not?  Dude, I love it, bro.  I wanna see more fucking posts is what I'm saying.  Let's go.  For sure, dude.  Hey, hit me though.  Hit me with the one you didn't close.  The one that I lost was,  they told me at the end of the call  that they had to talk to their spouse.  Okay.  And so I gave them until the next day,  until like around noon.  And then I called them, didn't answer.  And then we started going this back and forth  where he would shoot me a text.  He's like, yeah, call me later, blah, blah, blah.  I would call him and it didn't happen.  And I just ended up getting another business owner  and closing him.  So, but yeah, he just never got back to me.  So that one, was it the spouse or partner  or was the spouse a partner?  Or was like spouse partner or spouse spouse?  Like not involved in the business.  Spouse, spouse.  Yeah, that's a tough one because,  dude, the thing with those is like,  this is the pitch that they got, right?  So he got the phone with you.  He goes to his wife and he goes,  hey honey, there's this guy, he's in North Carolina.  He wants to do leads and it's 1500 bucks a month flat rate.  She's like, fuck no.  She has no involvement in the business.  She wasn't on the call, so you're fucked, right?  So the only thing I would say,  like this is an easy one in the sense that like,  you just gotta make sure upfront that you let them know  that if there's a decision maker  that needs to be on the call other than them  to get them on the call, okay?  Yeah.  That's the only way.  Cause dude, overcoming that shit is really difficult  because like that person doesn't even know  what's going on in the business anyway.  Makes sense?  So here's one thing that I've been doing  and a lot of you guys, I think even probably you,  do you remember the video I sent you  before we jumped on the call?  Yeah, that's what I've been doing.  Like when I send over the screencast right when I end it,  I say, you know, just make sure if there's anybody else  that has to be on the call, bring them on.  That's what I say.  And since then I've had no issues with that objection  or it hasn't come up.  So you did, you started doing that after you lost that deal.  Correct.  That's beautiful.  So all of you guys that are on,  all of you guys that are listening,  that's something I do and I'm showing you an example.  Like the thing is, I know if you're jumping on the call  to talk about FFM, it's probably a good fit.  Like you've seen the videos, you want to grow,  but guess what?  People get weird, people get nervous,  people do all these things.  So I don't want",

So I send that video out and you guys know,  I kind of made an over exaggeration  if you need to bring your dog, your goldfish,  your spouse or Jesus, bring them to the call  because I ain't doing, I want to think about it bullshit.  So you can say it a lot less confrontational,  but nonetheless, it's the same concept.  So I like that weaving it into the pre-closed screencast  is brilliant, dude.  I love that.  It's exactly what I do.  And it's also part of the training.  It's like, the other thing too,  is while you're doing the calls and the leads,  you could also, hey, so is it just you  or is it your partner?  Like, do you have a partner?  Is your spouse involved?  But I would definitely say,  is there anyone else that needs to be involved  like in this decision?  And you can, instead of being like,  making it like a lot of buying pressure,  just say, look, man, I don't want to play telephone  where I tell you everything.  You got to go to your wife or your partner  and then half of it's missing.  And then it's like,  I don't want to have to pitch this twice.  So get them on the call.  And literally when you jump on, say, hey, so we're good.  Like there's no one else who needs to be on this call.  Okay, cool.  And if they say, yes, cool, we're rescheduling this bitch  because I ain't going to do this twice.  But dude, it sounds like you already knew the answer  but I'm really glad you came on to tell everyone.  And that's definitely something you guys  should be incorporating at the end of your Zoom close  or your screencast just to mention,  hey, if there's anybody else, get them on the call.  And if that means we need to reschedule, I'm okay with it  but it's going to be way more beneficial for both of us  to get them on the call.  Yeah, can I say one last thing before I get off?  Please, please, please.  So usually what I've done and I did the same thing  with that person that I lost the deal with  was when I'm sending over the leads,  whenever I get on the phone with them  and I feel like they're not that busy  and they have a couple of minutes to talk  and I ask them all the questions about your closing rate,  your profit margin, right there I incorporate that question  of like, are you the sole decision maker?  Do you have like any other partners or whatever?  And so with that person, I did the same  but I didn't bring it up on the screencast, right?  And last thing I'll say, dude,  is I couldn't agree more with you  when it comes to the entire setup.  And the reason why I say that was  the last deal that I closed, this guy has a partner.  They run a concrete company.  They do about $3 million a year.  So he obviously has partners and nobody came on the call.  It was just him.  And it was the easiest sale of my life.  And why?  Because of the setup, because I did it properly.  So as long as you do the setup correctly,  you're gonna get the deal, man.  So that's what I wanted to say.",

    "pageContent": " Guys, before we get into the actual zoom, what we're going to do, I want to talk really  quickly about best practices.  These are some things that if you will do these, you're going to increase your odds  and likelihood of getting the deal, okay?  You're not going to do these perfectly every time you're going to forget.  It's not going to be possible sometimes.  You're just going to do the best that you can given what you have to work with, okay?  I want to give you an example of where I learned this and how effective this was.  Back when I did door-to-door sales, they taught me, my managers at the time, they taught me  something really interesting.  They said the closer, the same thing that we're talking about here, but they taught  me some specific technical things to do.  They were like, hey, the closer you follow these specific things, the more likely you're  going to be to get the deal.  I became very rigid, very disciplined of doing these things because it always led to a sale,  okay?  Let me give you one example.  One thing that we always did and we were taught to do is when you go in the home, they said,  hey, when you go in the house, the first thing you're going to do is you're going to identify  the kitchen table.  You're going to go over to the kitchen table, you're going to take your binder and your  iPad, you're going to set it right at the kitchen table exactly where it's going to  be the best place to talk to both the husband and wife, okay?  Or both spouses or both partners, whatever.  The reason why you do this is because business is more likely to happen at the kitchen table  than at the couch.  And statistically speaking, if you sit at the couch, people are going to be relaxed,  they're going to be distracted, and they just think that they're talking or just talking  about the overall concept, but we're not getting down to business.  But when you sit at the kitchen table, people know that you mean business.  You're there to look at stuff, you're there to sign papers, you are doing a deal at the  kitchen table.  So since business happens at the kitchen table, not the couch, avoid the couch at all measures.  Go put the binder at the kitchen table and you will close more deals.  I did everything I could to make sure that was the case.  And I will tell you, there were some times they didn't have a kitchen table.  In a few instances, there was no kitchen table, so I did the best that I could.  There was a few times when they were insistent that we sit at the couch because the husband  was in a wheelchair or the kitchen table was full of stuff.  But even when it was full of stuff, I would just say, hey, it's fine, let's just push  some stuff to the side.  Like there was times there was mounds of stuff, right?  Disgusting, like syrup on the counter.  I would still sit at the kitchen table because I knew that's where deals happen.  So that's just one example.  So the equivalent of that with our deals are the following.  First of all, the time of day that you schedule the Zoom call.  It does matter.  And what happens is if you leave this up to chance and you just say, hey, business owner,  what time works for you?  That is a bad question because they're going to give you a terrible option.  They're going to say, well, I have a little lunch break here, here, here, and here.  Well, let me",

    "pageContent": "tell you about lunch breaks.  First of all, you know, as a business owner, they typically don't happen, number one.  Number two, the day gets going and the lunch break that was supposed to be an hour becomes  10 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, and they're rushed, right?  They're in the middle of the day, they're getting calls, they're getting inquiries.  They're trying to make money just like you.  And so, and on top of that, like imagine they're sitting at a diner, they're sitting at a fast  food restaurant and they're FaceTiming you from their phone.  Again, guys, that is not the best case scenario.  So here's a best practice as far as the time.  Try and do it first thing in the morning or late at night, okay?  That's what I have found to be the most effective and morning is definitely the best.  For me, it's best because I wake up, I'm fresh, I get a deal before I even go to the gym,  but also for them because they're not distracted, they're not getting hit up yet, so I like  early in the morning.  It's my favorite thing to do.  Secondly, I like to make sure to tell them, hey, be by a computer.  Now, the reason I justify it is I say, hey, I'm going to want to show you a couple things.  It's going to be really hard for you to see on your tiny phone.  So if you could be by a desktop, that would be perfect.  Or a laptop, be somewhere quiet by a laptop because I want to show you some things and  I'll usually tell them, hey, if we can do that, it's going to go a lot faster.  And really the reason why is I don't want them calling me from a cell phone where they're  going to be distracted, stuff's going to be coming in or they're going to feel like they  can just call me from a grocery parking lot or a gas station.  Guys, I've had somebody, because I didn't do this, they were going to buy dog food and  thought they could just FaceTime me or Zoom me, whatever.  So the first two things is the time.  I prefer mornings.  Second thing is make sure they're at a desktop or a laptop somewhere quiet.  Third thing is day of the week.  One thing that I have noticed is I've had really, really good luck getting people to  jump on the phone with me on weekends.  And you think about your business.  Typically, your customers are bugging you because they just don't feel like they can  or maybe they're not working.  In weekends, you can work on your business, not just in your business.  And so I've had really good luck on weekends.  Outside of that, I haven't really noticed a difference as far as days of the week.  So Monday, I do know Monday tends to be a lot busier, so that's one day I try to, if  possible, avoid.  But you know what?  I also want to get my deals on Monday.  So I still like to do sales calls on Mondays, but it does seem that it's harder to get  people to schedule on Monday.  It's through the weekend.  Maybe they forget.  So I like to do, you know, Tuesday through Saturday.  Saturday would be my best option.  I personally don't do sales calls on Sunday.  That's up to you.  But I do know that on weekends, people are going to be working more on their business  than in their business.  So guys, once again, do your best to follow those best",

I have built my billion dollar seven figure $100,000 month agency,  literally doing the keyword, building my keyword list,  the way I teach you guys how to do it in the training.  Literally sitting down and it helps if you have a dual monitor,  but you don't have to sitting down when I didn't have a dual monitor,  I would print off a list of the keywords and I would be typing on my content.  I would start with five questions and I would literally go through  and I'd start writing and every time I would do a keyword,  I'd make a check mark or a strike and I would manually check  and make sure I included as many keywords as possible, but didn't overuse it.  And then when I got the dual screen, I would have the keywords over here  and the document over here and I would do the exact same thing,  except it was digitally.  And I have built a seven figure agency writing content, old school.",

    "pageContent": " All right, guys, let's go ahead and get set up for the zoom close.  So what I do is 20 minutes, 15, 20 minutes before the actual close.  I come over to my computer, I get my tabs all dialed in in order and that way I'm ready  to go.  So I want everything to be clean so I can just go click, click, click, click, click,  show them everything.  And it's just this nice, easy process.  So what I'm going to have you guys do hop over with me to my screen.  All right, guys, so what I'm looking at here and this we're going to reference this more  in the next lesson.  But I do want to mention that in the FFM closing script 2.0, I have put the that says zoom  close prep.  I like to put my tabs in order.  I'm actually going to move this so that it's right here at the top.  And this is the tabs that I like to pull up.  So I like to have something for my monopoly strategy.  So what I'll do is I'll just have like a window open that says, you know, if I'm doing because  in this example, I'm using Queen Creek concrete.  So I would like to use either some some other project in Queen Creek, which I could, but  I think it's more effective to use somebody in concrete.  So I'm going to use the Bentonville concrete example.  So I've just typed in in Google concrete Bentonville.  OK, now you can be strategic here if you're not ranked for every keyword, you may want  to go ahead and search for the keyword that you are ranked the best for so you don't look  like an idiot when you do that.  And I've done that before.  I'm like, hey, let me go ahead and search this.  I search it and I'm like, oh, where's my website?  So just, you know, this one, I know for this, I rank for almost anything.  So I'm not as worried.  But if you're only ranked for like five out of 10 terms, make sure to use the ones that  you're ranked for.  OK, so I have this.  That's one of the windows I like to have pulled up one of the tabs case studies.  So you can either use like, and this says case studies slash social proof, so you can  either have, you know, like we talked about in the screencast, you have text message screenshots  or emails or whatever that say, hey, you know, we've closed this huge deal, whatever.  Or case studies could be your actual website.  So what I'll probably do is I'll have this website actually pulled up.  So I'll have another tab with this website pulled up.  And then the other thing that I do as far as like case studies is I like to show with  the projects that are really producing leads, I like to show the leads.  Now, I don't recommend that you show the leads if you're not getting leads or if you're pre-selling,  right?  Or if this is your first project, sorry, not if you're pre-selling, but if this is your  first project and you don't have another project to say, hey, look how many leads this is getting.  Don't show them.  OK, only show what you have.  Does that make sense?  Now, I don't want you guys, this is what you got to be careful of.  I can make this look however I want.  I could get these guys, whoever this is, to believe that I can produce a lot of leads  based on",

But what you got to be careful of is you can paint this picture however you want.  But remember, if you oversell, you will deal with it later.  OK, so I'm going to show the leads just to show them the ability, but I'm still going  to pitch them on the 12 to 15 lead range.  I'm not going to have them expecting this.  I'm just going to show them the ability that I have to potentially get them this many.  So they know I'm not messing with it.  But some of you guys are going to watch this and go, well, I don't have any leads.  I don't have any sites producing leads.  It's OK.  Just don't show the leads.  Just don't overthink this part.  Last thing I like to pull up is the lead value calculator.  And if you are doing this for your first time, you may want to drop the numbers already in.  So 5,000, I like to zero this out, 5,000 being the average ticket price for concrete profit  margin.  I'm going to put it at 20 percent close rate.  I'm going to put it at 30.  And then I don't like to show what would you charge per lead because I ain't going to charge  per lead.  OK, so you can zoom in like you could tell.  Even at 100 percent, this is perfect.  It shows just this on my computer, but I like to even zoom in sometimes.  I don't even want them to think there's an option because I've already told them there's  not.  So these are the tabs that I have pulled up.  I get everything ready.  I make sure my audio is working.  I make sure my zoom is ready to go and definitely make sure that you record these calls, make  sure your Wi-Fi is good, get prepped.  And then what I do is for a few minutes right before the call, I get in the zone.  And I know that sounds kind of cheesy, kind of corny, but I literally think about this  and I go, OK, I got a lot of shit on my plate right now.  I got a lot going on.  I'm thinking about a lot of stuff.  I got a family, I got kids.  I got this thing.  I got this problem over here.  I got like, for example, right now, like I literally today, I have tax stuff I got to  deal with.  I'm looking at buying a property.  I got to go golf at, not got to, I get to go golf at five.  I got to jump on the phone with somebody for another real estate thing at two.  I got to zoom out like all this stuff.  What I do for the five minutes before the call is I sit and I go, all right, this is  everything that I am doing up to this point.  The leads I'm sending, the list I'm building, the reason you're in this damn program leads  to this moment right here.  And I don't want you to overthink it.  I don't want you to spook yourself out, but I want you to get pretty damn serious about  the fact that this is what matters.  And you performing for the next one hour and doing this correctly and being all in and  not distracted, phone on silent, kids quiet, internet working, this is where I make money.  I do a lot of shit that doesn't make money because I'm not perfect.  But this activity right here is the",

Should I do it all in one or split it into three?  So repeat that question again.  So you're saying split the budget into three?  Yeah, or make three separate ads.  Like do only one ad that concentrates on cement keywords,  do another ad that only concentrates on patio keywords?  You know what?  That's a really good question.  I don't wanna give you guys,  I would not wanna give you advice that,  and I said this at the beginning of the call,  this would be a question  I would much rather fix it paid ads answer.  What I would want you to do on this question,  and I don't know if you caught this,  but we're actually redoing again the training on the ads  and also the entire training.  But for this specific question,  I think this would be valuable for everybody.  If you would post that, just that simple question,  say, whatever, post that in the group,  and then if you want to go a step further  and make a quick little loom and send it to me  and fix it paid ads, I'll give you an in-depth answer,  but I don't wanna just shoot something off the hip.  So would you do that for me?  Yeah, I'll definitely do that.  The only reason I ask is because  when you have targeted keywords for that ad,  you get to that 100%, how good the ad is.  You get poor, good, and excellent.  If it's all related,  you get closer to the excellent faster, that's why.  My knee-jerk reaction is I would tell you  to do a separate ad for each,  because yes, that is the relevancy,  that's really gonna help,  and we've noticed that that's been a big thing  with the way that we're doing ads now.  However, I also don't want to,  if there's somebody out there that's listening to this  and they hear, oh, three ads,  I would rather you just get them up  than not get them up at all.  So if that's causing analysis paralysis, no,  but yes, 100% what you're saying,  I think that is gonna be the answer.  But I would love for you to post that.  Let's get everyone's feedback.  I'll get fix it paid ads in there.",

You haven't made enough offers  That's your first problem. If you don't know what your thing is, you need to start doing more shit  You're not asking enough people for enough money. You're not doing enough calls  Okay, once you do enough calls, you're gonna figure out real quick. What that thing is for you. Now, here's how you solve it  very simply  You start doing the very thing you're asking people to do  If you keep getting I need to talk to my partner. I  Need to talk to my wife  Go talk to your partner. Go talk to your wife. Hey partner. Hey wife. Do you trust me?  If something comes across my desk, that's at least actually, you know, whatever blah blah blah blah. Are you good if I make that decision?  Yes or no, okay, cool get on the same page overcome it if you have an issue with contracts  You got to unfuck your mind because guys life is contracts you have a house you have a car you have a cell phone you have  All these different things like life is literally contracts  Okay, if you have an issue with price you need to get around people that are spending more money  You need to get around people that are making more money  You need to quit going with people that when they choose where they're gonna eat  They're thinking of where can I get a meal for five bucks because they're broke as shit  Okay, you need to go sit down with somebody that goes and they don't even look they get the appetizer  They get the bottle of wine they get the frickin dessert  They get they just look at what they want and now your mind is gonna start to expand like, okay  Yeah, that's actually not that much thousand bucks not that much. I just spent three hundred dollars on dinner  Okay thousand bucks is nothing  That's how you overcome it. So my challenge to you guys this and then we're gonna jump into QA is  Whatever first of all, if you don't know what that objection is for you, you're not making enough offers  You need to do that first  But if you do know the objection if you want to overcome that and quit getting that you need to fundamentally  overcome this in your head and  The way that you do that is by doing the thing that you keep facing by signing the contract  Okay by making the decision same day  By doing it without your wife or your husband or your partner  Okay  Now again strategically by not worrying about buying something because it's too expensive because you know what money's money and I'm gonna make it back  Okay, that's how you overcome it",

I thought for some reason I need to set to send leads for three weeks two weeks a month 20 leads 2530 leads.  I just thought that's what you needed to do I thought you need to send a certain number of leads. You do not need to send more than five leads, and a lot of cases I send three, and some cases I send one.  Never send more than five free leads there's a sweet spot when you send a couple. It's, it's sexy it's interesting it's okay I'm playing along.  But when you send too many over too long a period of time that sexiness that newness that value starts to get diminished starts to get watered down, and they, they almost become entitled.

Yeah, yeah, I can hear you.  What's your question, dude?  Let's go.  Yeah, so, like, you know, like, my question is, like, about Google Ads.  So, like, how, you know, like, important is it in the process of, you know, of this process?  Like, does it start with Google Ads, or is there any other way to do it?  Yeah, so it's up to you, guys.  I personally prefer using Google Ads because I like to pre-sell my sites.  I like to go and get that deal up front.  However, like, there's the other way to do it, which is the traditional way.  I call it the traditional way, which is where you go, you pick a city, you pick a niche,  you rank the website, then you go and sell it.  So if you're somebody, let's say you don't have a lot of capital and you're nervous to  spend money on ads, you know, I still would argue it's better to go get the deal up front,  but maybe you're not confident in your ability to sell it, whatever, and that's what you  want to do.  That is fine.  If you want, you could start at the second half of the training, build a website, rank  it, and then go and start using the first half of the training to sell the deal.  So you can do it either way.  I just prefer going into it and getting paid while the website's ranking.  Okay, so when you're running Google ads, like, you know, like, do you do test out like three,  four sites or sites or properties, or you just run with one and then, you know, see  if it is validated or you just stop it or you continue, you know, sell it off.",

When you first start, I would recommend starting with one, but once you get going and you've  gotten that first deal, you can start adding two, and then once you figure that out, you  can start adding three.  And then what I do is once one website, one ad starts to really work, I start to get leads,  then I pause the other two and I focus on the one and so forth.  So when you first start, you probably want to start with one.  Got it?  Okay.  Let's go get a deal, brother.  You also, one thing I want to remind you of, make sure that you're focusing on asking people  for money, because no matter what you do, no matter how much content you do, no matter  how many backlinks you do, no matter how many websites you look at, unless you're asking  people for money, you're not going to make money.

How you doing, man?  Hey, I'm about to get a hurricane up in here.  So just enjoying the sunshine.  I love that, dude.  Don't waste, you know, never, what do they say?  Never waste a good tragedy or a good opportunity like that.  Exactly.  Dude, one of my best years, 2018, I was in this niche called, I don't recommend this  niche by the way, but at the time I was in basement waterproofing and, dude, it was the  best time ever because all the basements flooded.  Yeah, I know, man.  I got a GMB for foundation repair.  I think it's going to get really active.  Oh, yeah.  A hundred percent, man.  So where are you at right now?  I'm in Jacksonville.  Beautiful.

I wish I'd been putting more time into it.  I'm so busy with SEO clients and they take up so much of my time.  I keep putting out fires every single day.  I just want to give a big shout out to you, but also want to ask you, would you recommend  kind of burning the boats and ditching some of these clients in order to free up more  time or do you have any recommendations for outsourcing?  So I definitely, like when I started scaling, first of all, is this, it's kind of a contextual  question because if you need it to pay the bills and it's keeping you out of your job,  then that's one thing.  But I also know that it could be the thing that's causing you not to scale because your  attention is definitely going to be split.  What I did, again, this is just from experience, is in 2020 when I started scaling is I found  a strategic partner.  I created the strategic partner.  It was my employee that was doing my SEO.  He started",

He would pay me 50% of the net profit.  That allowed me to keep some of the money, but also just to focus strictly on lead generation.  So that's what I did.  It worked out really, really well.  I still was able to make about, and every time I use, I say I made 100K a month.  I hope you guys know that was just with lead gen.  This was, when I talked SEO, that was just like gravy.  We were doing like 7,000 to 12,000 a month, my split of SEO, which means I could have  taken 20 if I would have done it myself, but I just decided, I could have taken 15 to 20,  but I decided I'm going to take half of that focus on lead gen because that's where I could  actually scale.  So that's what I would recommend as far as outsourcing.  I don't really have anyone that I've used that I would recommend.  I can ask around and get that for you.  It's just difficult when you're doing white labeling because people do the bare minimum.

I'm going to go to Robert really quick.  Robert said he's got clicks, but no phone calls.  Can you assist?  One thing I would love to just try and just reiterate that something that I've tried to  really focus on is try to just, whenever you have an issue in your business, try to just  use your intuition and think, okay, and by the way, this goes for anything.  If your business owners aren't closing, but you're getting a bunch of people to a closing  call, then you could use the same exact logic, okay?  But with this situation, you're like, okay, I'm getting clicks, but no phone calls.  That means that people are clicking on my ads and I'm getting no phone calls.  Well, then you start kind of digging deeper, you go, all right, well, assuming that these  people are visiting my website, then that would mean that I'm either getting the wrong  people to my website because they're not ready to buy, they're not ready to call for an estimate,  so that could be number one.  The other thing is I have the right people, but my landing page isn't converting, right?  So that's what you have to look at and you have to kind of be logical about it, okay?  So what I would recommend is there's a couple of different things that you can do.  If you have an idea that maybe your",

    "pageContent": "website's not converting, you can go, there's a software  called Hotjar, you can install Hotjar on your, and there's other ones too, but you can install  Hotjar on your website, you can track and look at what people, you know, when they come  to the page, what are they doing, are they scrolling below the fold, are they doing this,  are they doing that, whatever.  So that's an idea.  If you think it's a conversion issue, if you think it's maybe the wrong type of customer  or you think they're clicking on the ad and they're not going to the website, for example,  I know sometimes I used to think it was my competitors, maybe you could go and you could  track, you could set up your analytics, you could see, are you getting, you know, how  much traffic are you actually getting?  Is it increasing?  Is it lining up with how many clicks you're getting?  And you just kind of have to dissect it from there and you just have to do a process of  elimination.  But if you guys are using the core keywords, you guys are following the training, most  likely you have the right traffic going to your website, which means that you have a  conversion issue, which then I would go, hey, is your website, you know, something that's  actually converting, is it user friendly?  Is it something that is scaring people off?  Is the number easy to find?  Is the quote form easy to find?  Or are you burying the stuff at the bottom, making it difficult?  So you just kind of have to use your intuition there.  Go look at some of our example websites.  You could go look at BentonvilleConcrete.com.  It doesn't have to be complicated.  It's very simple.  I promise you guys, even the ugly websites convert.  So that's kind of how I would attack that.  But that's a really good question, Robert.  OK, Luke, you might have had another question.  He's back in the waiting room.  Oh, shoot, hold on.  I think I might have just jumped him in there again.  Hey, did you?  Oh, he's out.  OK, I thought he had another question.  I was like, OK, boy.  Anyway, all right, let's keep going along.  Guys, any questions you have, drop them in the chat.  If you would like, you can you can grab the link.  I'm going to actually pin that comment so you can join with that link above.  You guys are just hopping on and you want to click on the Zoom.  Guys, I'm not that scary.  I promise you, I'm a complete goof.  If you guys, I know when I've I used to get on these live calls and I  was like, oh, my gosh, I can't imagine getting on live with the person.  It's not that big of a deal.  Just hop on live.  And, you know, let's ask your question.  It's going to be quicker.  All right.  Linnell says Google Keyword Planner says,  before I say this, I want to let you guys know something that's kind of exciting  because this is an ads question.  We actually this is this is why I love that I'm in the trenches, that I'm in the game,  that I think that you cannot trust anyone that's not, is because things change  so freaking much with this business, with any business.  I don't know how you could be in the business five years ago, 10 years ago,  eight years ago, like when I started or maybe four years",

So what I want to let you guys know is we are in the process of once again,  testing out some new ad strategies, testing out some new  campaign strategies, spending my own money, testing it on my websites.  We've been doing this now.  It's been about five weeks, I believe.  And we're going to run it for another three weeks, making it eight weeks total.  And then we are going to be redoing the training for the ad section.  And I hate to even tell you guys this, because then everyone's  going to start asking when's it going to be done, when's it going to be done.  It's not going to be done probably till Q1 of 2025,  but we are actually going to be redoing the entire training  start to finish, which would make it the third version of this training  since we launched. OK, I'm actually really excited about it.  I'm a little bit nervous and intimidated by how big of a project that is.  But I also want to always be giving you guys relevant information.  And so any of those little tiny changes, it's kind of like when you have the books  and it's like the classic Think and Grow Rich and it says,  this is the 24th edition, right?  Just those minor things that change with the times.  So a lot of these things, I'm telling you this because once we launch  and what I'm going to do is before we actually launch,  I'm not going to wait to give you guys the the ads updates.  And we're going to introduce the ads updates as soon as possible.  And then for like two or three weeks, we're going to be doing Q&A on these calls.  So any of these questions, we're going to give you guys, you know,  the the the exact answers, maybe even show you guys live on screen.  So I just want to let you know that.  But let me look at this question says Google Keyword Planner says high end CPC.  By the way, Linnell, I don't know if you knew this already.  Have you checked out Ryan Dalton's  rank and rent engine? OK, because that is going to be our go to tool.  I should have mentioned this at the beginning.  But that's going to be our go to tool for search volume.  That's going to be our go to tool for due diligence.  That's going to be our go to tool for everything.  If you guys did not see that already, I think I can message Ryan right now.  Let me look. But there we were doing a  I'm going to drop the link really quick.  We were doing a link. I'm sorry, not a link.  We were doing a beta discount for anyone that wanted to check that out.  So I'm actually going to put this on your comments.  And I'm only mentioning this because that's going to be our go to on  the search volume and the due diligence and everything else.  OK, so check that out.  I can't even remember what the code was.  You have to look at the last one.  There's a code that you guys can use that will  maybe I should message Ryan really quick.  Hold on. Let me message him while we're waiting.  We just ask him, Ryan Dalton,  what's the discount code for beta users?  OK, anyway, guys, check that out.  The thing is sick. I'm pumped about it.  I'm actually going to be spending about",

Is it because the time of year less?  Lonell, can you do a favor for me?  Just make a quick loom.  Send me what you're getting or send it to me and send it to fix it.  Paid ads as well.  And we'll check that out because that's a bit more of a deep question.  And we'll dissect figure out what the heck's going on. OK.  Simon says, oh, what's going on, dude?  Luke says, we're in the meeting again.  Why are you reading this people just join the program?  Luke, Luke, Luke. OK.  OK, Simon has an interesting question.  He says, what do you think about Ecom with the digital asset approach?  Can he do it?  Guys, my answer to this is whether you're asking me about, you know,  whole barns, whether you're asking me about assisted living leads,  if you ask me about whatever, if you use this strategy,  which is getting paid traffic or organic traffic to a landing page  or to a website, you are going to get leads or conversions.  Because if you sell a product, the same principles apply.  However, the thing that makes this model so special  is the fact that we can use a generic website.  And we if if let's say our client starts to get sideways on us,  they start to get a little funny, they start to complain.  We can sell those leads to somebody else.  So if you do Ecom, let's say you go to a company and they're like,  hey, I want you to sell these water filters for us. Right.  And you're doing all this SEO for these water filters.  That's great.  But first of all, first of foremost, you're probably going to be doing SEO  on like a national level, which makes it very difficult.  It's going to be much more difficult to get SEO  to rank using SEO to get organic rankings.  The other thing, guys, is that company is kind of going to have you buy the balls.  Right. Because if you're advertising their products  and you're using their branding or their location or their specific  keywords that they want to target, what happens if they don't want to buy leads anymore?  So you have to remember that one of the best parts about this business model  is the ability to have complete control over our assets  and not have to be at the mercy of anybody.  And this kind of defeats the purpose of it.  So could it work? Yes. Do I recommend it? No.  If it's your own brand and it's your own ecom products,  your own ecom store, your own products, then OK, fine.  Use the SEO principles in the second half of the training to get your website ranked.  But to do it for somebody else, I don't think it's the move. OK.  There goes Luke Hill with the discount code ignition 24. Great.  Thank you. I'm going to try and.  Oh, he already did it. Thank you.  Beautiful. OK. Robert says hot jar.  Wow. Thank you. Yes. Hot jar. Great tool.  OK. I got somebody the waiting room.  I'm going to jump to them really quick.  And then I've got one or two more questions.  By the way, Simon said it's his own website.  Yeah, Simon, use the SEO.  Use the SEO strategies in the training for sure.  If it's your own website,",

I have no idea.  I'm guessing who's SD, who's got the initial SD. SD.  I can see that you're connected to audio.  I just can't hear you. I can't see you.  Let me know if you can hear me. You can see me.  OK, not hearing anything.  Don't know what's going on.  Let's see what we got. OK.  Well, that person is figuring out what's going on.  I'm going to keep going.  OK, Rob Lamb says, what social media accounts do you create  like Facebook business page, Instagram page, Yelp  to increase your chance of getting a GMB as part of creating a new city niche account?  In other words, what are things you do to help improve Google acceptance?  Guys, I don't spend a bunch of time with GMB anymore, OK,  because to me, can you?  Yes. Is it still possible? Yes.  Did we actually recently got a GMB like in the last two weeks  trying some new strategies, but I have not found anything that's tried and true  that I'm confident saying, hey, here's the new strategy.  What I've kind of opted to do instead is that I am going to focus  on getting better at ads and getting better at organic rankings faster.  OK, because guys, think about it like this.  I've said this before, but you got to realize that when we have  with Google, right, you can get leads from paid ads,  you can get leads from the Google My Business or the local  and you can get leads from organic.  And if you can get two of those three, you're going to be just fine.  Back in 2020, when I was just trying to figure things out  on more than half of my website or at least half of my websites,  I didn't even have a GMB because it didn't click to me.  It didn't occur to me that I could use the business owner's address.  I didn't understand all the stuff.  And so I was going along getting deals scaling up to one hundred  thousand dollars a month, not realizing that I even needed a GMB.  You don't need a GMB.  Now, if you can get one, does it help? Sure.  But even if I have them, I don't like to rely on them for leads  because I feel like they're always problems.  You're falling off. You're doing this.  You're getting suspended. You're checking, checking, checking.  So for me, I just decided, you know what?  I'm going to focus on getting better at the things that I know how to do,  which is ads and organic.  And if we can get the GMB grade, if we can't, then whatever.  However, I will tell you that, yes, the Facebook business page does help.  The Yelp page does help.  But me personally, I'm just focusing on I told you that I'm in simplification mode.  I mean, hey, these are the things I know that work.  So I'm going to focus on them.  And so that's what I've tried to put my effort on.  That doesn't mean you can't.  Doesn't mean that's not a possibility, but that's where I'm putting my focus. OK.  What else we got here?  So hopefully, oh, there we go. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. ",

Find your question, because I saw your question on the other one.  And I know to be very honest, I saw it and I was like, it's kind of long.  I'll come back to it.  And I'm glad you hopped on it because I forgot to go back to it.  So ask me your question.  All right. So I'm having a tough time figuring out if I'm picking the right guy.  So I just went back to the keywords that you created.  OK, so I'm doing like a ton of analysis.  Maybe I'm doing too much.  I'm analyzing like 26 here because I wrote it.  I'm a programmer, so I wrote an app to do all this for me.  I'm not doing it manually.  So I'm running like 26 keywords per city.  And that's the screenshots I put in.  So am I doing too much?  Like, how do I know if those cities I pasted in are actually good?  Yeah, I think you're doing too much.  I mean, dude, look, I think you're doing too much.  Look, I think people like you are I swear to you.  And I mean this and I mean this as a compliment.  You guys are too smart.  Like the reason why this model works really well for people like me is because I'm like,  all right, I don't even have the patience to do more than like five or seven.  I don't think you need more than five or seven keywords to analyze the city.  OK, all right. So the second part was, I mean, let me say one last thing.  So like tree service, I know that the lists are in here.  I can I can share those two.  And guys, if you guys have lists or you've seen lists I've shared in the past,  that would be awesome for you guys to reshare those.  I can also go and find them.  But tree service, you're looking at at least concrete, because it's just the one  that was used. So concrete is the core keyword.  They got concrete contractors.  I think concrete company, concrete patio, concrete driveway, concrete sidewalk.  There might be one more.  I'm going to use those keywords plus the city.  And that's going to be enough for me to say yes or no on a city.  That's part one. What's part two?  Part two was.  I can't remember right now, so it should I split out the ads like for  let's say I do three ads for concrete, like one is driveway, one is cement,  one is patio. Should I do it all in one or split it into three?  So repeat that question again.  So you're saying split the budget into three.  Yeah, or make three separate ads.  Separate ads like do only one ad that concentrates on cement keywords.  Do another ad that only concentrates on patio keywords.  You know what? That's a really good question.  I don't want to give you guys I would not want to give you advice that.  And I said this at the beginning of the call, I this would be a question  I would I would much rather fix it paid ads answer.  What I would want you to do on this question, and I don't know if you caught this,  but we're actually redoing again the training on the ads and then  and also the entire training.  But for this specific question, I think this is",

And then if you want to go a step further, make a quick little loom  and send it to me and fix it paid ads, I'll give you an in-depth answer.  But I don't want to just shoot something off the hip.  So would you do that for me?  Yeah, I'll definitely do that.  The only reason I ask is because when you have targeted keywords for that ad,  you get to, you know, you get to that 100 percent.  You know how good the ad is.  You know, you get poor, good and excellent.  If it's all related, like you get closer to the excellent faster.  That's why my my knee jerk reaction is I would tell you to do a separate ad  for each, because, yes, that that is the relevancy that that's really going to help.  And we've noticed that's been a big thing  with the way that we're doing ads now.  However, I also don't want to, you know, if there's somebody out there  that's listening to this and they hear that, oh, three ads,  I would rather you just get them up than not get them up at all.  So if that's causing analysis, paralysis, no.  But yes, 100 percent what you're saying, I think that is going to be the answer.  But I would love for you to post that.  Let's get everyone's feedback.  I'll get fix it paid ads in there and then keep an eye out for this  updated training, which we're about five five out of eight weeks into the testing of.  All right. Sounds good.  I think I got all my questions out of the way.  Awesome, man. Well, I appreciate it.  And let's go get some deals, dude. Thanks a lot.  Hey, talk to you, man.  OK, guys, there's another question or two I want to answer.  You guys have really good questions.  I've got a question is what do you guys use for phone numbers?  I'm going to drop the rank and rent engine  link because that is where we are now buying all of our phone numbers.  However, another option is call rail.  But it's a little more expensive.  That's what we started by using. OK, so there you go.  Hopefully that answers your question.  Luke said, if you throw up a GMB as well for Ecom, it can be a moneymaker.  I've done it before, but that's for more.  Yeah. And that's a good point, Luke, is if this is for your own Ecom,  you're going to be able to get if it's a legit brand, a legit company,  you should be able to get your GMB much easier.  So that's a great little nugget you tossed in there.  OK, Simon says, do you have a list where one can see the key  services by country, if not, that would be really handy for all of us.  Post that in the group. Great question.  And I think what he's saying is like, what are the recommended  services in each country?  And I think that that would be the the the people that are most  equipped to answer those questions would be the people in those countries.  OK, so I'm not doing any deals in Australia.  I'm not doing any deals in the UK personally,  because I'm making my money here.  It makes no sense for me to do that other than probably just a test,  which I probably should.",

However, I do know just off top my head,  tree service seems to be something that is valuable in every single country.  I've seen that in every single question.  I'm going to I'm going to stand by that one.  That one seems to be like a pretty good one in every single country  from what I could tell. OK.  Steven says you can also decline the recommendations and it will push you up  to 100 percent. Amazing. Great feedback. OK.

But that was kind of just like a hey, let's let let's let people  in the community test this out first.  But there will be a significant amount more.  Plus, there is a Facebook group.  I don't know if you're part of that yet, Gina.  Maybe I'll put this in the answer, but I'm going to say join  the Facebook group.  The rank and rent engine Facebook group.  Yes.

Robert says, Nick, do you try to sign first to be all  that is on top of the sponsored ad section?  Do you check there?  I don't I don't really care if they're at the top or not.  As long as they're running ads, they're going on my list.  But yeah, I mean, checking their reviews is not a bad thing.  If I'm looking at the reviews, they're like, oh, this guy is rude.  This guy had no customer service.  That's going to be my partner.  And that means they're probably not going to close deals.  That's going to be an issue. I want to check into all those things.  So Robert, check into those things.  But yeah, anyone at the top is going on my list.  That's part of our training or part of our module and  building your list.  So, yes. OK, Simon says he volunteers for Middle East and Armenia.  Amazing. Go ahead and make that post and then give us your recommended niches.  You recommend industries for Armenia.

Maybe you can and I can answer it on a on a comment.  But guys, I'm telling you, those of you guys that are worried about saturation,  we are there. Go watch my videos.  Type in saturation. Is Rankinret saturated on YouTube?  And go listen to my logical answers, OK?  This is not saturated.  And just because you guys are seeing other Rankinret people,  other marketers does not mean it's saturated.  Just because there's someone else the website doesn't mean you can't have one.  Just because there's somebody else that, you know, sorry,  just because there is somebody that has a website in your niche and city  does not mean they even have a client.  It doesn't even mean that they're even in the business anymore.  It doesn't mean that they know how to sell and create a deal.

It's fun to connect with you guys, to to hear your voices,  see your faces, to remember that like we're all in this together.  We're all trying to make money.  We're all trying to create better lives for ourselves.  So, guys, let's go make some money.  Don't forget that you're not making money if you're not asking for money.  OK, no matter how many of these questions we talk about, you know,  we, you know, as this keywords that at the end of the day,  it's about how many offers we make.  That's how you make money.  Stop being distracted.  Go ask people for money and let's scale this thing up, guys.  I'll see you guys later in the week, hopefully with Ryan.  If not, I'll see you guys next Tuesday.  I'm out.",

    "pageContent": " Okay, guys, unemployable peeps, fellow rank and renters, what's going on, guys?  We're going to do a really just super impromptu.  I messaged Stephanie yesterday and I was like, hey, what do you think about going live with  me tomorrow?  And she you're like, well, it depends on what time.  And then I like two hours ago, I'm like, what about in two hours?  And she's like, I have a, you know, she had a closing call or something.  She's like, but I think I can make it work.  So let's do it.  We didn't give anybody a heads up, by the way, here's Porter.  We'll let him in really quick.  We didn't give anybody a heads up.  We've just decided to go live, share her story, do this interview and look at this.  We've got dogs.  We've got babies.  I got to get something on my lap.  Bro, where's your kids at?  Yeah, I know.  So Stephanie, what's your dog's name?  This is Mike.  This is my niece.  This is Gracie girl, Gracie dog.  I like the name of me.  Great.  Ever since I watched the show Armageddon, I always loved the name Grace.  Really?  Grace.  And then we got Ford over here just munching on his hand or his toy.  Just going hard, dude.  I got the bottle.  I got a burp rag.  Just I'm ready to rip, dude.  How old is, how old is Ford now?  He's only, he's four months.  Oh, is, is Ford doing anything productive at the house?  He doing deals yet?  Or is he just like nursing and pooping?  Just sleeping and pooping.  But hey, he did sleep eight hours yesterday.  So get, get this baby, get this baby a whoop watch.  Let's see what kind of REM sleep he's hitting.  Oh, dude.  He slept like a baby.  I had to check his pulse.  I was nervous.  I love it.  Well, Porter, thanks for hopping on Stephanie.  Thanks for being on.  Anybody else that's on, appreciate you.  I know this is super just out of nowhere, but I hope a bunch of people will see this  interview.  So guys, today I want to interview Stephanie, me and Porter want to interview Stephanie  and talk about how to pre-sell your way to $8,600 per month.  Um, Porter is also just so you guys know, just to, to have an idea of why I have him  on here, he's making a, is it 10, 10, six now Porter?  Yeah, 10, six.  I asked you that and making sure you didn't cancel seeing if you got any other deal.  So is that 10, six, uh, $10,600 per month.  Uh, I think a hundred percent of those are also pre-sales.  Yeah.  Okay.  So, um, I wanted to have these two on.  We're going to be interviewing Stephanie though.  But guys, the reason why I wanted to interview Stephanie is I love interviewing  people that I've worked with that I've literally watched start from zero, knowing nothing about  the business.  And then they persevere their way to where they're absolutely crushing it.  They've got momentum on their side.  And, uh, that's exactly what we've got here with Stephanie.  So, um, I looked this up before the interview, Stephanie, you, you",

    "pageContent": "started working with me  or you started, I guess, let's just say you started, uh, pre-selling or you started focusing  on the sales piece of this business on May 31st, 2024.  So let's call it June 1st.  So it's been 10 months, nine months, not even, not even that.  Okay.  Something, something like that.  And, uh, the interesting thing about Stephanie, and I'm excited to really get to hear her  story, but she didn't just, you know, sling five deals in the first week.  She, if I remember correctly from the post and from everything else, like there was a  little bit of a learning curve and there was some setbacks and stuff like that.  So, um, is that, is that, am I getting that right?  Or am I confusing this story with somebody else's?  Yeah.  No, you're a hundred percent correct.  I'm not a fronter.  I didn't, I didn't crush it out of the gate.  Yeah.  I was a late bloomer.  So, I mean, I'm, I'm gunning for you Porter now.  Like I'm, I'm crushed.  I'm going to be in five figures and I'm gunning for you, Papa.  But, um, so if you, once you pass Porter, I think there needs to be, you do send me  a message.  We'll, we'll do some kind of a little, uh, some little spit for you because I can't,  and I hope you do a post just roasting Porter.  Hey, I got, I got one cooking Stephanie, this, this week.  Did I for cooking?  I have for cooking.  Oh, yeah.  Stephanie's got for cooking, but you're, you're, I don't know, man.  Um, they're in the air fryer.  They're not in the slow cooker.  Like I'm telling you, like what I love about pre-sell, like I call it like pre-sell is  a microwave.  I'm like screw it, like no, no offense to Chevy and all the organic people out there.  God bless you.  But I am not into like that.  I call that the kimchi, like fermentation method.  I'm like, I don't have, I'm too fricking impatient.  And, and, and because I'll play devil's advocate, I think that a healthy bill, uh, uh, a really  healthy business, you probably have a combination of both.  So, um, maybe what we should do to, cause there might be some people that watch this  that are on later that, um, like what the heck is pre-sell?  What, what are you guys talking about?  I'm sure a lot of people do know what that is, but, um, it, let me have Porter, Porter  explain what we mean.  Cause obviously everybody knows the traditional method.  You pick a city, you pick a niche, you build a website, you start a business, you start  a city, you pick a niche, you build a website, you start doing SEO, it ranks, then you start  worried about selling it.  Porter really quick.  Why don't you just explain in a, in 10 seconds, what, what it is that we do when we talk about  pre-selling.  So basically instead of rank and rent, it's rent, then rank.  So build a one pager, run Google ads, use the leads that we get, sell them to a business  owner.  And then as soon as you collect credit card, go in and build it out. ",

    "pageContent": "So you're just, you're flipping the model completely.  Stephanie, anything you want to add to that definition or that description?  No, no.  I mean, I just a hundred percent Porter nailed it.  I mean, it's really, it's just a matter of you're, you're getting the money up front.  So then that you then can backfill it and do all the other fun stuff on the back end.  But you have a business owner who is paying you and then you can just block and load  onto the next one.  You know, what else is cool or what I was thinking about in like, cause I always like to  use an analogy or think about it as like regular real estate, but you know,  um, with, if you were to build apartments, let's say, of course there's people out there  that have a bunch of money.  They go, they, they, they, they've done it for so long.  They know what a good piece of land looks like.  They know the right location.  They know what it should cost per square foot, all that stuff.  They get investors, they put these projects together and then they start selling them.  Right.  But there's also people in like Dubai, for example, where these big companies,  I think it's called the Mac, the mock, these guys go in, they have the plan.  Then they start pre-selling.  They bring you in, they show you their showroom.  They say, Hey, we're going to do this plan for you.  You're actually going to pay for this right now and you're going to help us build it.  We're going to get you a lower rate.  But by the time this thing's built, it's going to be worth $50,000 more.  And you're going to have an apartment or a space in this, this huge complex  that you're going to own.  And so they literally have it self-funded by investors, by people like me and you.  So it's the exact same thing, guys, instead of us going and putting our own money,  our own effort, our own risk, we're literally going and saying, Hey, Mr.  Business Owner, I need you to fund the project that I'm going to own.  And what do you think?  And it sounds crazy if you think about it in like a real estate context,  because in the real estate example, the customer or the business owner would own the property.  But in this example, we own the property, even though they fund it.  So I like that.  I want to jump it.  Like, that was a little bit convoluted for my pea brain because I'm back in the US.  But in terms of real estate, I love that.  Because years ago, you know, I'm down in Vegas.  I know you're up a little north, but they had all these track homes, right?  And so they have phases and they roll them out in phases.  And if you buy in phase one, by the time they're still in phase seven,  they've already increased in price, exactly.  What we're doing is kind of like we're selling out of a trailer.  They haven't even built one yet.  So people are buying off plans, like they don't see it.  And so that developer is taking all those deposits and those sales  and using that money to build out everything.  Or they're building out either that development or they're using it to buy another parcel,  then to chop it up and do the same thing.  So it's OPM.  It's other people's money.  That's a great term.  OPM, other",

    "pageContent": "people's money.  The only difference between the examples that we're using and this  is that we're actually owning the property.  Whereas in those examples, the person paying the money would own the property.  We also get to own control and keep the property  that we can then go and sell eventually and all this other stuff.  So super exciting.  The cool part about it, guys, is that if you guys are in this program  and you guys are in Unemployable, you guys are in the right place.  You have the fundamentals down pat.  Shiv is the best in the game when it comes to teaching all things,  SEO, backlinks, content, building a site, ranking a site.  And then what I do is I like to show people how to do it fast.  And so that's what we're going to talk about today.  So let me just share my two goals for this interview.  Number one is I want to inspire and motivate you guys  that if you'll stay the course, that you are in the right place  and you will find success because you're going to see  that didn't happen overnight for either of these two people.  And then I want to at least give you one actionable takeaway  that you can take this week and implement and push it into your business  to move the needle in the right direction.  OK, so here's the reason, Nick, why are you doing this?  Why are you coming to this group?  Well, the reason why, guys, is that I did this exactly like you guys are doing it.  I did the rank, then the rent.  I did it did work.  I got deals, but I could never scale.  I could never get to the numbers I wanted.  Money that excited me was one hundred thousand a month.  And I started doing the projections and it just never made sense  for me to go build out a hundred websites to then try and scale.  And so as soon as I figured out pre-selling, it unlocked  two things that were constraining me.  Number one is time.  Number one, number two is money, right?  Because now I use other people's money, like Stephanie said, OPM.  And I don't have to wait six months for a website to rank.  So I've got some questions I want to ask Stephanie.  And then I'll let you guys ask any questions you have, Porter.  I'm probably going to ask you some, Porter, if you have questions for Stephanie.  But I just want to run through these and we'll keep this nice and tight.  And hopefully there's at least one person that we help on this live.  And then hopefully a bunch of other people will see it.  Okay. So that's not fair.  Cool.  Amazing. Okay.  Okay. Real quick, because I don't know if anyone knows the full story,  but let's just talk before this whole world of digital real estate.  What were you doing for work?  The one year before I started this, I worked for a 501C3, which in the U.S.  That's a nonprofit.  Yep.  I was a salaried employee for $40,000 a year.  And I taught elementary school kids how to grow fruits and vegetables and plant gardens.  Interesting.  I did that for one year because I had just moved back to the United States.  For the 13 years prior to that, I was living in Europe and New Zealand.  And so I was, but right before that, like during COVID and everything, I was in Greece  and I ran for 10 years, I ran a vegan cooking school.  Okay.  It's pretty much like rank and rent.  Yeah. ",

    "pageContent": "No, but I've always been in sales.  And so I love planting, I love food, I love landscaping, and I love teaching.  And so I was on my feet.  And then when I came back to the U.S.  And I had to move back to the U.S. because my parents are old  and I had to come back to see them.  Otherwise I would still be in Europe.  So I came.  Hold on.  So where are you at right now?  What city?  Vegas.  Okay.  That's why I thought that.  And I was thinking, and you just really referenced Vegas, but for some reason, anyway.  So, okay.  Good old Vegas.  How's the, by the way, real quick, not to detract, but-  Dude, it's freaking raining today.  It's raining.  Oh, okay. Good.  I'm glad you're suffering as well.  All day.  Like, like, yeah, I was like, where's my raincoat?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Porter, is it snowing in Parowan?  Tonight.  It's supposed to snow a couple inches tonight.  So you guys need it, but keep it over there.  Are you in St. George, Nick?  I'm in St. George, but Porter's like an hour north.  I know.  It's not that far.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's raining here, but it's going to snow there because it changes a lot.  The temperature of that.  I have all my besties are up.  They all go up.  They're all up at Duck Creek.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's going to be cold in Duck Creek for sure.  And if you're up there, you say Duck Creek, not Duck Creek.  Just let's get the record.  Okay.  All right.  Guess what?  I know it's hurricane and not hurricane.  I got it.  I got it.  You know the area.  So, okay.  So you were doing, right?  A year before, you were working for a nonprofit and now you're doing this.  So in all of your previous years when you were in Europe, did you ever have any sales experience,  tech experience, anything like that?  Okay.  So I have less than no tech experience.  I would tell people, I'm like, I can't even spell IT.  That's actually kind of a funny joke.  Like literally, I had people, I thought about it today.  The last time I used Excel was when I came to UNLV in 1991 for graduate school.  By the way, that was the year I was born and they were really good that year too.  Dude, the running rebel.  Dude, like F Duke, by the way.  Like I bleed red.  I'm a running rebel all through and through.  F Duke.  Yeah.  Anyway, yes.  So no, I can't stand IT.  I always outsourced it.  I have a back, before I had a cooking school, I have a background and I was a recruiter.  I was a headhunter.  I have a background in selling mortgages.  Like I've always been in sales.  So the sales problem was nothing for you, but the tech.  Yeah.  Okay.  This isn't a question I had, but how is selling this different than selling  mortgages or anything else that you've sold?  Well, it's a lot easier.  It's because it's your Costco thing, right?  Because you give them free samples.  Like I",

So now that, you know, like for those who are like kind of high,  it's a little high level here.  If you don't know what I'm talking about, you know, go look it up.  But, you know, you don't have a lead magnet in mortgages really.  Like, what am I going to do for you?  Like, okay, I can run a free credit report for you.  Yeah.  But I can't let you feel how it is to be in the new house.  I'm not going to do like a little demo closing,  you know, like, you know, signing.  I mean, like, you know, you got to cut.  There's a little bit, there's a little more faith.  You know, you're betting on the come.  So, you know, in terms of the cook, my cooking school, people were like,  I would sell these big giant packages and they're like, you know, like,  I was like, my biggest package was like, you know,  $7,000 to come train with me in Europe.  And so these, I was selling, I taught in English,  even though we were in Spain and Greece, but we taught in English,  because it's an international language.  So I was selling to people from India and Canada and Australia.  So they had to buy their ticket to come stay with me for a month.  And then they had to pay me $7,000.  And then they had to also lock,  put themselves up in a hotel or Airbnb for seven weeks or whatever.  So it was, you know, it was high ticket sales.  And they're like, how do I know you're any good?  I'm like, well, you don't, but they can watch videos.  You know, like, here's an example.  So I could do a little bit of, you know, free sampling,  but you don't know.  But what we're doing right now with the way you do the pre-sales,  we're giving them sample leads.  They're the exact same thing.  It's not like, it's not a scaled down, it's not an abridged version.  It's the exact same thing.  As long as you make sure you give them good leads.  I mean, you don't want to give them scrub leads.  You know, you cherry pick your own leads  and then you send them to the BO.  100%.  From somebody, I sold, of course, a couple of different things,  but selling alarm systems compared to this, I always tell people,  this is like, not that it's easy per se,  because it's obviously takes some work and some skill once you,  but you don't, by the way, just so you know,  you don't need sales experience to do this.  Porter had zero sales experience.  The only thing he ever did in terms of work was worked on the farm.  For me, I sold door to door and selling this,  I sit there and I'm like,  people are complaining about picking up the phone.  I'm like, look, you don't have to knock on a door.  You don't have to go in the sun or under the rain.  You don't have to get the door signed on you,  a gun pulled on you, any of this kind of crazy stuff.  You get to pick up the phone.  And not only do you get to do it from the comfort of your home,  but you get to call and say, ",

    "pageContent": "do you want something free that you're already paying for?  I mean, how hard of a sale?  That's the initial sale.  And then you're into the actual sales process.  So Porter, for you on this note,  how difficult was it for you from somebody that had no sales experience  jumping in and trying to do sales?  The first couple were definitely a little bit uncomfortable, I would say.  I think I remember I answered the first one,  or I called the first business owner and I think I totally,  like diarrhea, the mouth, just everything.  He asked me a question, I answered it.  So they definitely go smooth,  but it definitely helps when you have a structure that's laid out for you,  something that you can follow and have a process.  But I mean, it definitely was a lot easier than I had anticipated.  I always tell people the business model is very simple, but it's not easy.  It still requires work.  It's not going to be like this quick, easy cash,  but it's a lot easier in a lot of things.  Okay, let's keep going.  I like what you said.  The first time you do anything, you suck.  I mean, whether it be bake a cake or paint a billboard, whatever you do,  the first time you do anything, it's not your best one.  I mean, the first time, I'm sure Nick, you did a live.  Look at your lives and your content and your courses now versus your very first one.  I mean, whatever it is, your first one is never your best,  but you got to start somewhere.  Yeah, great point.  Really good point.  Okay, so this is a question.  I'm not looking for any specific answer.  I legitimately want to know because I remember for me how it felt,  but from comparing it to when you were at zero,  you're starting this business, you're cutting your teeth,  you're not really sure what you're doing.  I'm going to ask you and then Porter.  Stephanie, you're making 8,600 bucks a month.  Obviously, that's top line, but how does it feel knowing,  hey, this actually works and I can do this and the sky's the limit?  Does that get you excited?  Does that get you overwhelmed?  Does it make you anxious that you should be doing more?  How do you feel knowing, hey, I've made it 8,600 a month, but how do you feel?  I think like you said in a lot of your videos,  you just got to get one already, you're built.  And then even after I did one, I kind of laughed because I watched so many of your videos.  I mean, so many.  I mean, literally, no offense, I kind of got sick of watching you.  I was like, oh, and it got to the point where like,  oh, is it like blonde Nick or is it brown Nick?  Is it bearded Nick or is it not Nick?  I'm like, but I mean, I watched tons and tons of content  and just to really get it dialed in while I was going through your content  and getting going.  And I believed everything you said.  I didn't think you were just blowing smoke,  but you know, and I was like, oh yeah, I want to feel that too.  And even though I did one, I still even, not that I had,  I'm like, okay, I knew I could do it before.  And then after I did it, I knew I could do it.  But then I knew that, okay, now you just go",

You tweak it and you find out what works for you.  So was it overwhelming?  No.  Do I feel like I should be working?  I think every single person in your bit,  what I love about this business is every single person can do their version of it.  Because you do have a lot of people who are doing like, I'm not one of them,  but I know like you asked the other day in the group, you're like,  who's still doing a nine to five and then it's slamming deals on the side.  I'm not doing it.  This is all I do full time.  I knew for me, like this is the bandwidth that I had.  And where I am in my life, I needed to do this full time.  So I just wanted to speed it up.  But that's not right for everybody.  But everybody can do it.  I think the important thing though is for people who are going to do it on the side,  because like, you know, I know you're a blind guy.  People who don't speak English is a first language guy.  You have like, you know, you're a guy with people with kids and this and that.  Can anybody do it?  Absolutely.  Is it more difficult with all those other things on your plate?  Yeah.  But is it undoable?  No.  So it's just a matter of keeping your priorities straight and that's it.  And so all I did was reverse engineered where I wanted to be.  Like when you bring people in, the first thing you have us do,  and once we get into your paid group, is to do our map.  You just got to do your map.  And I call the map the reverse engineer.  It's like, okay, where do you want to be?  Okay, well, if you know where you want to be, then now it's like that's the end.  Like if you put on Google Maps, like that's the end point.  But you know where you are now.  Now you got to reverse engineer it and work backwards and put in all the steps.  Because that's what people get overwhelmed.  Like, I mean, okay, I think most people do, but I mean, I could say I do.  And the way to not get overwhelmed is that old adage, you know,  like how do you eat an elephant one bite at a time?  So you break it down into baby steps and, you know, you check stuff off and you feel good.  And then, you know, just landing your first deal is like checking a big step off.  I mean, it feels really good.  You know, and then you just go to the next one and, you know,  and you just keep on moving, get momentum.  Yeah.  No, I really like that.  I still remember, guys, my very first deal that I remember the first dollar I made online.  And I remember the first pre-sale deal that I did.  It was back in 2020.  I'm not going to tell you guys the whole story.  And by the way, Ford, I'm coming to ask you how you fell in your first deal.  So zip your lip for a second, bud.  No, I'm just kidding.  I'm going to ask him.  I'm going to ask him.  Don't worry.  But I remember it was like this idea.  I think we can pre-sell.  I don't",

    "pageContent": "know if we can.  And we did a test.  We had a site.  Actually, at this time, I was still building organically first.  I had a site that was generating a couple of leads, ran some ads to it,  did kind of a version of my process that I teach now, but it wasn't perfect.  I got in the closing call and it was the easiest close I ever did.  And I remember getting off holding the credit card digits.  I wasn't even expecting the deal.  I had to write down the credit card or the piece of paper.  And I was like, first of all, I was shocked.  Second of all, I ran the card.  And then all of a sudden, my mind was like just blown.  I'm like, oh my gosh, I could make any amount of money possible  because now I can do this without waiting for it to rank.  It was like, it just clicked.  And I was like, okay, this is the key.  This is that one missing piece that I think the model was missing.  So, Porter, without further ado, since Ford's raised his hand in his own way,  wanting to tell us how did you feel?  How do you feel at 10,600 bucks a month never having run your own business,  never having really worked any other job besides on the farm,  and now you're renting simple websites to local business owners  and basically doing sales to do that without having any experience?  How did that feel?  It honestly gives you a lot of confidence.  It's like knowing that I can still do this while doing something that I love.  So if anything, it's allowed me to be more confident in myself  that I can support a family, myself, go and do and be who I want to be  without having to do a nine to five or work some other job.  You know what I'm saying?  Like it's a weird thing, but it's like a mental thing too.  The money is great.  But what it does to be able to know that you can always make more money  and that the sky's the limit, it makes you want to always do more  because you're around people that are doing so much more than you.  But dude, it's the greatest feeling.  Gives you a ton of confidence.  I've seen the thing I love most is when I see people that start at zero  and then I see them when they made their first deal or 5K, 10K,  is their confidence is night and day.  And that's really fun for me.  So, okay, let's keep going.  Stephanie, was there a moment or time that you almost gave up  or thought about quitting?  Be honest.  And if so, how'd you get through?  I never thought about quitting because I didn't get myself an out.  I assumed that was going to be your answer, by the way.  But I keep going.  I want to hear the rest of it.  But I will tell you, did I scream?  Did I yell?  Did I cry?  Did I have sleepless nights?  Did I want to freaking punch like you and other people?  Absolutely.  The nearest baby.  Believe me, it's not all a bed of roses.  It's like, oh, golf's easy.  All you do is you just hit this ball in this little hole.  I have a friend who's a big...  I know you play golf, Nick.  I have a friend who plays golf.  He never swears.  Never, ever swears.  He's the most mild-mannered guy.  And I'd be like,",

So it's simple, but it's not easy.  How did I get through it?  I literally said...  And it was actually somebody in your group.  I think it was Levi that was helping me, and I was talking to him.  And Levi's one of your students down in Australia.  I was like, Levi, this freaking dude Dylan's just like, volume this.  I'm like, God damn it.  I'm like, man goes this.  I'm like, in some rush, assholes and blah, blah, blah.  I get like, dude, I'm not afraid.  I know I might sound like a sailor.  I'm like, God damn it.  I'm like, what the heck?  And then at the end of the day, he was like, he's like...  It was because he literally said to me, he's like, you know what, Stephanie?  He's like, he said, and I was worried about going into cities  where there were other lead gen people.  And he's like, look, he's like, I'm not afraid of that.  I'm like, really?  Why?  And he said, because I know I can outlive him.  I have the strength and fortitude and acuity and knowledge and everything.  He's like, I'm not afraid of them.  And I went, huh.  I mean, granted, he has years experience than I did.  But I went, oh, okay.  Well, I'm like, well, that makes sense.  And then I can't answer this.  I don't know what happened, Nick, but I swear to you that what happened was  I just had an aha moment.  And I don't know whether it was from one of your videos,  like where you actually said it or whether or not I got the feeling.  I don't know exactly when it happened.  But I had this feeling, this thought, and then I had the feeling.  I'm like, I don't know how I'm going to make this work.  I just know it's going to work.  And that was it.  And then I never deviated from that.  So no matter what, I'm like, okay.  What I did last week and last month, that isn't working.  And I'm like, I make changes a lot.  And I made changes this week and big changes.  And I'll talk to you about them in a little bit if you want.  But I mean, I'm constantly reevaluating and assessing  because all I feel is like when I'm doing things that aren't working, that's data.  And then I'm like, if I'm doing stuff that I know isn't working, then stop it.  Yeah, that's it.  I like that.  Yeah, I don't even have anything to add.  I could say something, but it would be the exact same thing that you said in my own way.  So let's just leave it and move on.  Next question I have, and this is going to be specifically for you, Stephanie,  is why did you decide to start pre-selling  versus just waiting for websites to rank due in the traditional way?  I'm impatient.  I'm not willing to wait.  Again, I think the organic way is a great play.  I think it's super for the right person who's patient  and a person who loves to",

Oh, let me set it and forget it.  No, I want it now.  I want it now.  I want the microwave version.  Air fryer.  I want it now.  I don't have time.  It's like in or out.  I tell people I'm like, this is not rocket science.  We are not building.  I'm not a brain surgeon and you are not a rocket scientist.  I laid it out.  This is what it is.  That's why I don't do any of those.  I call them TOs.  No thinking over.  None of that bizzo.  I'm like, dude, you know it.  You know right now.  I don't hit them this hard.  But I will say this about whoever's watching, by the way,  I want to back up and I do want to share this  because I know I sound like a royal.  I know I come across strong now,  but I will tell you when I on the other side,  when I first saw your videos, Nick,  like I had seen your stuff and when I first  was just learning about the rank and rent industry  because I didn't know about it,  I knew I wanted to work online.  I just didn't know in what venue  because I knew I had to do something that was online  and I really wanted something that had recurring revenue.  And so for a hot minute, I was doing credit card sales,  merchant services, because that has residuals.  I didn't want to do insurance that has residuals.  I didn't want to be a stockbroker.  Like I hate the stock.  I hate the market.  I didn't want to get licensed in series seven, blah, blah, blah.  I didn't want to go that route.  But I wanted to have something where there was recurring revenue.  I don't want to sell high ticket sales  because those are one hit wonders.  I don't want to be like one and then done.  So this really ticked on my boxes.  But when I first looked at your stuff,  I mean, I saw all your stuff  and with your strong personality, I was a little taken back.  And I knew who you were.  I saw you.  I'm like, wow, this kid's intense.  Everybody has their own process.  It took me a while to warm up.  And I'm like, it wasn't until I got in and learned the model.  And then I watched, there's that guy, what's his name?  Like James Dooley, like the guy over in the UK.  Like I was watching all his, do you know him?  Yeah, I don't know him personally, but I've heard the name, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So basically he's like just crushing it in the UK.  Like he's like his own age refs, whatever.  He's like crushing it over there.  But I'm like, you know, and I was like, wow, you know,  like so many people from all different walks of life are killing it.  And I'm like, oh, it all makes sense.  And every single person in my real life,  you know, my family and friends,  when I would tell them about this industry,  they were like, I'm like, A, did you ever hear about it?  No, it's not saturated.  I'm like, but B, I'm like, does that make sense to you?  They're",

    "pageContent": "like, yeah, that actually makes a lot of sense.  So then fast forward, then, you know, I just got to the point where  I knew this was no matter what, it was going to work.  I didn't know how.  It's like a combination of the same, you know, it's like squid games.  Like, you know, like you don't know which combination is going to work.  I just knew it was going to work.  I didn't know how long it was going to take.  It was a matter of if, it was a matter of when.  Yeah, yeah, I like that a lot.  For me, in 2020, 2019, I was still doing the business.  I was having mediocre success.  I was still doing it the old fashioned way, the right then rent.  And, but in the back of my mind, it was still,  I was kind of like looking for like,  if there was a better opportunity, I was ready to jump.  You were a lurker.  You were lurking around.  I was a lurker, a dabbler.  I was half pregnant.  Peeping Tom, Peeping Nick, Peeping Nick.  I was, I had the wandering eye, right?  And finally in 2020, I was like, okay, I, you know,  I've got to take care of my family.  I've got to, I'm getting, I thought I'd be a millionaire at 30  and it's, I'm 29 and anyway, I started writing down.  I'm like, okay, I need to make this kind of money.  And I realized I had the right business model, like right inside my, in my hands.  I realized that there was a couple of things that I felt like were broken.  For example, having to wait six months on stuff.  But I knew the model was right.  And I just, I made up my mind and I was like, I'm going to do this mentally.  I'm going to do this until it works.  Like, I don't care if that's 10 years.  I don't care if that's 15 years.  I'm done.  Basically I married the model, done and done.  I was no longer dating and I didn't have any side chicks.  It was like, I married the model.  And as soon as I did that eight months later, I was making a hundred grand a month.  Now it wasn't overnight.  I worked my butt off.  I did the pre-selling.  I made this mistake and that mistake.  But to your point, which I've heard you say a couple of times,  and I want to make sure everyone understands is like, that's it.  As soon as you decide, hey, this is it.  This is what I'm going to make work.  Imagine Stephanie and Porter, if there was either nine to five,  whatever nine to five you wanted.  And then there was this.  There was no drop shipping.  There was no Etsy shop.  There was no FBA.  Do you know how many more people would be successful at this?  Because it would be the only option.  Right?  But the problem-  You want to kick your butt?  Yeah, you want to kick your butt in gear?  Like, like, like anytime.  Like I'm not, look, I'm never going back nine up.  Like, I mean, it's not for me.  But once in a blue moon, I have to get in my car and go travel.  Like, and then I'm stuck in rush hour traffic and I'm like,",

You know, like it's been a long time since I hated Mondays.  But I mean, you know, no more hating Mondays,  no more dealing with some boss who's an idiot that knows less than you.  You know, it's like no more times are you going to get told like,  oh, by the way, we're going to have your quarterly review.  Look, by the way, like when I, when I got hired for that job that I was doing,  for that nonprofit, my supervisor that was interviewing me told me six months later.  So six months after I got the job, we were at the Christmas party  and she pulled me aside and she's like, Stephanie, I have something to tell you.  I'm like, what's that Christie?  She's like, when I was interviewing you,  I almost didn't extend you an offer and hire you.  And I'm like, why is that?  She goes, I was afraid of you.  And I'm like, why is that?  She's like, because I figured like you'd have my job in three months.  And I'm like, well, I didn't want your job.  But yeah, thanks for the compliment.  I was over.  I wasn't qualified.  And I did have to like, I had a downplay because I was,  because I had a headhunting background.  I knew how to like sell myself to get the job, which I did have to downplay.  But from the day I started that job, Nick,  I knew I was either getting fired or I was going to get promoted.  And there was actually one job I wanted,  and it was going to be online and office based.  And they only wanted me in the field.  And I was like, not going to happen.  So I was like, bye.  But yeah, I look like years ago, I used to have this like,  I was doing like, my friends were like, you got to do a blog,  you got to do a blog, you got to do Instagram, you got to do this,  whatever social media, blah, blah, blah.  And I'm like, okay, mine's called be the driver of your own car.  Like, for those, because in my life, there have been times  where like, my sister called me on it, friends have called me out.  They're like, you're just going about your life.  Like, they're like, when are you going to have kids?  I'm like, I don't know when it happens.  They're like, you got to make that decision.  Like, look, I mean, this is years ago.  But I realized I had a, like, it was a shock of reality.  I was literally, my life was occurring and life was happening to me  rather than me grabbing like the steering wheel of my life  and freaking driving my life.  I realized I was in the back seat.  I realized I needed to get in the freaking front seat  and make my own decisions and my own choices.  And that's what this business, you know, allows anybody to do  because you can call your own shots.  You can make as much money or as little money as you want.  You can do it full-time, you can do it part-time.  I mean, look at Ryan Dalton, you know, like, look, he's killing it.  You know, he's still working full-time and he,",

And he's like, you know, he's on, he's supercharged and other people are,  you know, I know you have other people who are stay at home moms  who've been in it and they're doing very well.  And then, you know, you have, you have the entire continuum.  There's no wrong way to do this business model except quitting.  Yeah, very, very true.  I want to ask both of you this.  I'll start with Porter and then Stephanie.  But what is one thing and I want you to think about the real answer.  And don't just give me something that comes.  I mean, maybe something comes to your head,  but try to think about the main thing.  But what is the one thing that you can blame on your success?  Porter getting to 10-6, Stephanie getting to 8-6.  Porter, I'll have you go first.  What do you think is the number one thing that you can blame your success on?  And by the way, it's okay to pause because if you've ever seen  some of these guys, Elon Musk, wait to give an answer.  He has a pause that's awkward enough.  You almost think there's a glitch on the YouTube video.  So take your time and Stephanie, if you want to go,  if you have an answer already, you can go first.  Okay.  It goes back to what I was mentioning before.  It's just there is no other option.  There's no fork in the road.  It's not a matter of if, it's just a matter of how.  It's that constant belief.  And I'll tell you, I don't know how I'm going to get there,  but I'm going to freaking get there.  And again, it's like, don't be afraid to try anything.  Whatever you need.  And I'll tell you, I realized that I was, I have, look,  I have some very negative people in my family.  They're my parents.  And so I had to pull back from spending time with them.  And I had to stop and I had to stop talking to people  that don't understand the rank and rent business  because it's very easy for them to go, oh,  you've been in it for six months and you haven't made any money.  Oh, you invested how much money?  Oh, and you went down to New Orleans.  Oh, and you bought how many websites?  Oh, you know, like, I mean,  I can go on and on and on.  I'm like, dude, I don't need more negative Nellies.  I don't need that in my life.  I'm like, dude, check yourself at the door  so that I just zip my mouth.  It's like, I mean, I'm a big proponent.  I'm a huge follower of Dan Martell.  I love Hermosy and I love Dan Martell.  I'm telling you, if you want to follow too,  Nick, your stuff's great.  These are generalists, like Hermosy and Martell.  Fabulous.  It's about mindset and about not getting sucked.  It, you know, Martell actually was tap.  He's a Canadian guy.  And, you know, look him up, if you guys,  if you don't know him, but amazing guy.  And it was X number of years ago, he started making it big.  He wrote a whole bunch of SaaS programs  and this and that started killing",

And Martell was looking around like, who me?  And next thing you know, Martell goes over to Switzerland  with like nine other guys  and they're hanging out with Sir Richard Branson.  And he's, you know, he's having like all this imposter syndrome,  you know, feeling like he's not worthy of being there.  But he, I think it goes back to playing up  and surrounding yourself with the people.  And Porter, you made a great point about that earlier.  It's about being around other people who are succeeding.  You know, you have to play up in terms of like  being around other guys or women  that are doing better than you are.  And not being around the people who are going to suck you down.  It's very easy when someone is at their job  and they're sour grapes and they hate their life,  it's really easy for them to like poke a hole in what we're doing.  Even if we have a modicum of success  because it's natural human tendency that they have that  it's not that those are bad people.  It's just like, you know, when Britney Spears,  like, you know, like has problems on the news  or Janet Jackson flashes her boob or whatever,  like all of a sudden, like, oh, people love scandal.  People in general want to, like they want to hate on other people  because they don't feel good about themselves.  And so I had to make sure that I kept all that negative stuff out  and I would listen to YouTube videos every night, just audio.  I would stick it underneath my pillow of positive mindset stuff.  And related to money.  So like you guys can YouTube,  but like, I mean, there's YouTube videos for everything,  but it's just audio.  It's, you know, it's not, it's nothing visual.  It's just about, it's really about the positive, the auto suggestion.  And literally whatever you think about will come about.  And if you're worried, it's the, it's the power of,  it's the mindset of abundancy versus the mindset of scarcity.  And I will tell you one last thing.  A year ago, like after I stopped working at that nonprofit,  like I took like six or nine months off and I wasn't making any money.  So like, just for like, just for like kicks and giggles,  I started selling plasma.  And I'd be like in the plasma selling thing,  like they're like looking around, like going like,  like I'd be there in the middle of the day.  And I'm like looking around and you can tell, you just tell these people,  like most of these people don't have jobs.  And I'm like, and all of a sudden I went one day, I'm like, what Stephanie,  I'm like, what the hell are you doing?  Frickin stop selling plasma.  Like you, you got to get out of this like negative,  like you're like a poor broke, you know, person you've sell plasma.  And like, like, could I have used the money?  Yeah, because I was reading my say, like my, you know,  we talk about leaky buckets, you know, like, like my bucket was leaking a lot  because I didn't have anything going in the bucket.  It was leaking because I was investing in this business.  But I said, look, I said, I had to pull the plug.  I'm like,",

But it was conceptually, I needed to stop that negative scarcity mindset  and go full in to be around people like you, Porter and you, Nick,  and everybody else in your group to be like around people  and thinking like, I'm going to crush it.  They're crushing it. There's no reason I can't.  I love that. So yeah, I agree making the decision.  There's no other option. It sounds cliche, but it's a huge thing.  That's burn the bridge, burn the bridge,  burn the ship there, all the different ways of saying it's very, very true.  Porter, what about you?  I would say at the beginning, I think when people would post their deals,  it would kind of make me mad. I would be like, gosh dang,  like this person's landing deals and I've been in this how much longer  or I have more resources. Like it was almost a chip on my shoulder.  And I remember one time I was doing some 10 K coaching.  I remember one guy was like, how is he supposed to, you know, coach me  on if he's not even at 10 K. And so a part of it was just like proving  other people wrong, which is probably the bad way to do it.  But just like, Hey, I'm from a small town. I'm a farmer.  Like I can, I can do just as good as someone that has this much knowledge.  You know, so I think a lot of it has to do with like the chip on my shoulder.  But I also would say just the people that I'm around, like I didn't even  believe that there was that much money to be made until I was in this group.  And I was like, Oh my gosh, like I'm, I'm this little fish in this big world.  And like, why, why shouldn't I work harder? Like if I work harder, I can achieve that.  So that's what kind of drove me.  And that's what it continues to drive me is just seeing other people's success  and like, why not me? Yeah, I love that.  It's true guys. And that's, that's, that's a great thing about this group.  There's some really, really successful people in, and by the way, that's a great,  thanks for your answer, but in this group, not only in, in the rank and rent,  but like one thing I've noticed I really love about this group is everyone's from,  like comes this group already being really successful in the thing that they were doing,  just knowing or realizing at some point that it's not the avenue and the vehicle  they want to use because they want freedom and they want to have, you know,  time freedom, location freedom, financial freedom.  So make sure you guys are, you know, what I, one thing I would say in groups like this,  I have my own groups, I've been in groups, but if you will be somebody that's always looking  to add value and be a producer, not a consumer, not just one of these leeches, not one of these  freaking just try to suck as much information and hide in the shadows, but you're actually out there  if you learn something, you post about it. If you get a win, you post about it. If you get a loss,  you post about it. You're making connections. You're involved running an online business is  very, very lonely at times.

And guys, from these groups, I've made two business partnerships.  I've made a joint venture. I make over a hundred thousand dollars a year from,  and I've made some really, really good friends. So, but just understand you guys are in a group  of people. It's like we got in the world and we've attracted all the people into this group,  my group, people that want more highly driven people, people that aren't satisfied with just,  you know, their everyday life. So really good point there. All right, guys, let's do this as  we wrap up. I know we've been going for a while here. Does anybody want to spend just a few  minutes? No more than just five, six minutes. If there's any questions, does anybody have any  questions they want to ask Stephanie Porter on the topic of reselling, getting deals, getting to,  you know, but basically a six figure per month or six figure per year  amount, because, you know, 8,600 times up by 12, you're over the hundred thousand Porter,  the same with you. Does anybody have any questions that they want to ask? I'll give just like a  minute. If nobody does, we'll end the stream. And I have one last question I'm going to ask  both of these guys to end. So let me just see before I ask this question, if there is anybody  with any questions. Okay, so I'll keep my eye on this. Let me ask this question.  And then if there's nothing, we'll just end this. So my question for both of you,  let's start with Stephanie. Do you think everybody should pre-sell or is that only  for a certain type of person? And if so, who? I think everybody should pre-sell because  look, even if you do organic, you still have to get on the phone with the business owner.  I mean, there's no reason not to pre-sell. I mean, there's really no reason not to pre-sell.  Hey, you're preaching to the choir. You're preaching to the choir, don't you? You don't  got to convince me. Unless you, you know, you just don't want to help Google or Facebook or,  you know, any of these large companies. But, you know, I mean, there's really no reason not to.  Yeah. There's a look, there's a learning click. For those of you who are like,  there is a learning curve in learning how to run these ads. I mean, it is not, it's not a  bitty cracker cook like cake. Like it's not like this little mic box, you know, this little box  and you pour water and add, you know, like add one egg or whatever. It's not that easy, you know,  but, but, but, but Nick, you know, Nick has people on staff that walk you through it and help you.  And, and then there's some new tools that are available that make it much easier than back in  the stone ages when Nick started this and had to do it all by hand. And, and, you know, so it's  much easier now. And so, and by the way, the one thing I was worried about, not that I didn't want  to tell",

    "pageContent": "my story, but when I first started to, went to now, but I think it's real common. People  are worried that, that this industry is saturated because they see new people coming online and this  and that guys, there is so much fricking business out there. It's, it's like ridiculous. Like,  and even in the most like saturated niches, like, I mean, you know, it's, it's, there's so  much business. I mean, it's, it's, and every day new businesses are opening up. And like, I mean,  I shouldn't even say this, but I will. So like, I won't tell you which one it is, but I, I'm running  ads and, and I'm in, I'm in a market and in the same niche that's in one of Nick's trading videos.  I'll let you figure it out, Nick. That just shows like, like that shows, but the point is like that,  that even there, like, I knew there's more room and like, so you, you don't know, you probably  didn't know that because like, there's so much room, like there's so much business, like, I'm sure,  like, I'm sure, you know, you're, you still have your business owner and then like, I found another  business owner and I, you know, and so there's just so much room for opportunity.  Yeah, a hundred percent. Like I've, I, it's funny because as, as I started training this  I, it's funny because as, as I started training this, I started talking about, I've actually  that happened more than once. I'll, I'll be looking at rankings or whatever. I'm like, oh,  there's somebody that's coming in. And by the way, it doesn't make me mad zero. Cause I'm like,  Hey, I can work with a business owner. You can work with a business owner and everybody can win  because as long as we're kicking out all the other guys and then it doesn't matter. So,  okay, Porter, what about you? Do you just, you don't have to, you don't have to agree or disagree,  but do you think everybody should presale? I think so. And I do think that she've always used  this, but like, it's just another tool that you can use. I think the best thing about this is  no matter what you, you go into and you're doing your due diligence, you could look at two options.  You either presale, which it could be your first option. And then if it's too competitive to run  ads, you could organically rank and have those going. So I just love the fact that like you can  be doing both. There's a happy medium to both of these, but like, as far as like personalities  for pre-selling, I think anyone can do that. It doesn't matter where you come from. It's just  if there's a process in place, I mean, like I said, the way that you present it,  you're basically selling it before you're actually selling it. So I think it's a lot more about the  setup than, as you mentioned, the sell. Yeah. I think it's like this guys. I think that even  if you are having a strictly organic strategy, you should have one or two projects. You should  be trying to get one, a deal at all times running some simple ads that can speed it up. There's no  reason. You could have 90% of your strategy being organic, but there's no reason you shouldn't be  running ads and getting deals up front. It's okay. It diversifies",

    "pageContent": "your portfolio. Yeah,  a hundred percent. And the other thing I would just really quick mention, and then we'll wrap  this up is I give this strategy, I talk about ads, I talk about, hey, we're going to run ads  up front to a landing page, but you have to understand that you got to pay the piper or  you got to pay somebody that's paid the piper because like, I'll give you this really quick  example. I jumped on the phone with somebody. This is not from this group, by the way,  jumped on the phone with somebody with Kyle about two weeks ago, three weeks ago,  and this person was interested. They're in another group, not this one. They're not having the  success that they want. It's not going fast enough, whatever. They want to run ads, blah, blah, blah.  They don't know how to run ads. And they're like, let me get on. So they get on, they look at what  it's like to work with me and what that looks like as far as a commitment and stuff. And anyway,  long story short, they don't end up coming into the group. And I got a text today from this person  and said, Hey, I just want to say, I appreciate you. You give so much value in your YouTube  videos, blah, blah, blah. I actually feel like I'm in a pretty good spot. I went and bought a  Udemy course on ads. And I think I'm going to be good. And I just took my phone and I was like,  Hey, I don't want this to come across. So I did a voice note. I said, you're trying to do a  shortcut here, bro. If the person that's on the, if the person actually spent a million,  $1.5 million on ads like I did, and they actually know what they're doing, they're going to be  selling a Udemy course for 15 bucks. I'm just telling you that right now. So you could keep  going down the path. I've seen it a hundred times. You can go spin up some ads, waste a couple of  thousand bucks, three months of your life, and we'll have the same conversation, or I can help  you right now. So I say that because I love when people take action. I love when people get going,  but realize that you either have to learn it over the course of four years and a $1.5 million,  or you have to take it and you have to learn it from somebody that's done it. And I promise  you, there's a lot of sharks out there. There's a lot of wolf in sheep's clothing, as they say  in the Bible. And there's a lot of people that I know, and you guys know personally that are  teaching this that aren't making jack shit on their own agency or never have. So the first thing,  if you want to go to any training, I would go ahead and ask them, what have you made? Can you  show me your Stripe account and tax returns? And what are you making right now? Because I promise  you, it's going to eliminate 99.9% of people. Okay. That said, guys, I don't see any-  Well, I want to clarify one thing. I just want to say this. So even though I said that I'm in one  of your own markets, I do want to clarify because it's realized in that market, I'm running Facebook  ads. So I'm swimming in a different pond. And even if you were running Google ads, Stephanie,  I don't- Yeah, but no, but that's the other thing. I just want to show",

I have no worries at all. So-  You got to DM me and see if you can guess what market it is.  Okay. I'll DM me and they're like, hey, guess. And I'll shoot a guess. I think I've got a good guess  because I've seen two different ones. So I'll guess.  Really?  Yeah. But maybe they're not both yours, obviously just one of them. But anyway, guys, appreciate  you being on, appreciate Stephanie, appreciate Porter. If you guys do want to learn more about  pre-selling, I have a YouTube channel, which a lot of Stephanie said, I think I have 2.1,000  videos, just YouTube, my name, Nick Wood and RankinRet. We also, I have a free training  if you go to rentsimplesights.com. In fact, Porter, while you're holding the baby, dude,  hold on, freaking Porter. Stephanie, type that in the chat for me, rentsimplesights.com.  You can go see blonde Nick, brown haired Nick. You can go see-  Yeah, no, rentsimplesights, that one is brown haired Nick, don't worry.  And also different lengths too. Sometimes it's short, sometimes it's really long.  The Africa, Nick, you can see.  Yeah, you got everything. You got everything. And then I'm going to drop one more link after  you do that. About three weeks ago, some of you guys know I used to have a free Facebook  group where we would cover any and everything related to pre-selling and this and that and the  rest. And we got to this point where it just kind of got watered down with a bunch of looky-loo  tire kickers. So we actually moved the group over to school. So I'll drop that. It's now called  the RankinRet Academy. I'll drop a link to that. Don't feel like it's anything that you have to  do, but it's just something that you can check out. So there's some links for you guys. It looks  like Kevin said, hey, what's up, Nick, Porter, and Steph, cool. Yeah, by the way, Kevin says,  cool VA. So Ford's the VA now. I love it. Anyway, check out those links. Check out those links.  You know what I forgot to do, Porter? Me and Porter talked about this because he works with  me a little bit. I actually, inside of my group, I actually paid Porter to help out my students  where if they have a question, they can literally jump on a call. So let's do the same thing in  this group. What's your phone number? Let's give them your cell phone number.  So it's 435-393-5694. If you guys have a question, that's Porter's actual cell.  Text Porter, call Porter, preferably text him and he'll be driving a tractor, doing his thing.  And when he has like little 30 minute breaks, he'll jump on phone calls with people and help  them out. So are you cool doing that with people in this group if they want? Yeah, that's totally  cool. You have to message me anytime. Awesome. Are you on Snapchat, Porter? Snapchat, whatever.  You're going to get a lot of tractor Snapchat videos on that. Also, Stephanie, I do want to ask  one last question. What are you going to be at by December 31st? December 31st, what's MRR going to ",

She shared a story of a business owner that she was going back, she was doing the process  with, right?  She was going, everything was going good and she was supposed to do the Zoom call later  that day.  In fact, I think it was the same day, I think it was Thursday before the call.  This business owner hit her up, like many of these business owners do, and said, hey,  can we actually just reschedule the call, right?  Can we reschedule the Zoom call, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, which is what a lot of them  will do.  Linda said that she's had a tough time in the past, but she's like, I'm tired of getting  walked on.  I'm tired of people yanking me around.  She literally told the guy, she's like, I'm working exclusively with one company.  I'm interested in working with you.  I think her exact phrase was like, if this is important to you, we need to talk today.  We need to talk today.  Because she was bold and she meant it and the guy knew she wasn't messing around, the  guy rescheduled, which we don't know if he actually had something or what, it doesn't  matter, but he rescheduled whatever he had that was keeping him from that call.  He pulled over, they did the call, and she inked the deal.",

Yeah, we sign the contract, get the credit card,  get a credit card authorization, then run the credit card.  Make sure that it goes through.  We just ran the credit card.  We just did the pre-authorization.  But do we send out an email?  Do we schedule a phone call?  What does our next step look like to set those expectations?  Yeah.  So when I'm closing the deal, I like to also add in expectations  and how everything will work.  I include that into the closing call.  And then I, well, the contract, the card, whatever that part we already said.  And then I send them an email with things that I need from them.  That I do have a template, but sometimes it depends on the business owner  because for example, we need to set up a GMB or photos.  It's just a list of things that I need from the owner.  And I include that in the email.  It's like a welcome email where you get them a little pumped up  and you ask them information that you need to get started,  like phone number and stuff like that.  All the things that you need in order to make the website for them  and literally make the whole project.  So as soon as the deal is closed, then we just let them know,  hey, you're going to get an email from me.  I'm going to ask you for a couple of things.  I need you to give us this information.  And then from there, we can get things started.  So that's step number one is an email goes out.  Yeah.  So email goes out.  What happens after the email?  So after that, I just wait for them to respond with the information.  And then after they send that over, I don't really contact them  until everything is done.  And then when everything is built out,  which usually doesn't take us more than a week,  less than a week usually,  then I update them and tell them, hey, we're all done with the site  and just kind of give them an update.  And then after that, it depends on the client, to be honest.  Does the update happen on the phone?  Does it happen on email?  Does it happen on text?  See, that also depends because some clients will not answer their phones  and they just text me back.  They're like, hey, what's up?  And that way, I just usually send them a text.  Most of the time, I like to call them or email them is even better.  That way, I don't know.  I just like having the record, but it does depend on the client.  After that, yeah, I just check in with them.  And obviously, another thing that you'll do to contact them is  after that is built, you want to test the site,  which also that would also mean, obviously,  that you're going to call them when you're testing the Legion site.  So that's another way to kind of check in on the first week.  So the first week, you talk to them often.  You send them the email.  You call them to test the site.  You call them or text them or email them to let them know, hey, this is finished.  And yeah, after that, I check in with them every month.",

Hour and a half later,  I call them and nothing. I call them again, like 30 minutes later, nothing and nothing. So,  so at that point, do I just move on to the next person? No. So here's what you need to do. Um,  that's kind of like, cause you kind of got that scent sounds like when you were talking to him,  right? And you kind of tell this kind of a yes, man, he's getting, he's nice, sick. He probably  wouldn't do something to offend you. Kind of a guy like really soft spoken. If I get a guy  like that, because you could bulldog the shit out of those guys, but at the end of the day,  they're not going to give you their credit card.

If I call you back, are you going to pick  up or is this just the, this is the no, like it's a soft no. I'll, I'll literally say that because  if not, that guy might not even be following you. And now you're going to be like, Oh, I got somebody,  I got somebody. And you're going to be thinking, Oh, we're good, but you're not. So I would ask  right there and then get your answer. And a lot of times that pullback, they're like, Oh, okay,  this is different. This guy is actually like a real person, not a robot. And, and you'll get them  to answer right there. So that's what I would have done different. I would still keep hitting them.  Maybe like if the lead comes in, do a screenshot, blur out the number. Hey, I got this lead. I want  to send it to you.

Yeah, I would love your help on looking at these ads that i've got running  for a  Friend and a client at the same time. It's in the windows niche  and  installation or cleaning  installation  Yeah  so I  Picked him up as a just to help out with his  ads  Originally before I even jumped in this program. So looking at what it would look like maybe now  I probably wouldn't have jumped into this specific niche  Thankfully, it's it's still um, he's fronting the ad spin  so i'm not trying to do a lead gen for him just trying to help run this i'm trying to make it more efficient and  Help him bring more leads in getting some clicks, but we're just not getting many phone calls or conversions  So i'm assuming that some of the words that i'm targeting and maybe even the landing page i've got are not  With the best for conversions. So okay  You should be able to share your screen, I think I changed that setting, okay  All right, can you see my screen? Yes  Okay, great  So here's what we're looking at as far as the ads go  To the ads account  Yes, now I can  How long has that been running for what's the start date on that start date was uh, january 28th, okay, so about a month  Okay, good deal  And fort worth is how many people again? It's it's a big city, right? Fort worth is about  900 000 or maybe a million  Big ass city to be running campaigns. Okay  All right. What's your like daily budget?  Daily budget is sitting at  Going here real quick  I believe it's about 32 a day  Hmm. What's cpc for window installation? I would imagine it's bigger. It's pretty  it's  Probably over ten dollars. I'd imagine it can range. Yeah, it's usually about anywhere from 25 to 30  Or to 50. It can be even more than that depending on the city  I'm not i'm targeting different pockets the rural radius bubbles around three different counties  Which is a lot of area to spread through but trying to make it a little bit more specific to these certain cities that I think  That you could try drum up some business in  Okay. Yeah, two dollars a day  Okay. Yeah, and if something's like 20 you're not even yeah, okay, that's that's a big issue already. Okay  um  We'll go get into that.

Okay  Okay, I can see that as already being a big piece of it  Yeah, okay  Would you like me to show you  Yeah, go ahead. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to sidetrack you but I just when you said those things  I was like, let's just jump right into that because I know I love it. I can almost tell you that's that's an issue already  Yeah, so if I click into here you can see some of the the the locations  Right to see you what where i'm looking at  As soon as it loads that is  It's always slow and it's always slow in your own life. So don't worry about it. Okay  When it comes to those radiuses I can change them  I was doing zip codes for a minute and then realized like I have to double down on this  But I mean even Arlington's a humongous city  So a radius in a certain part of Arlington is not going to be nearly as effective like to your point  So these are these giant metro areas  Dude i'm working on  And yeah, you're probably running your ads to a couple million people  So I just need to I need to make it smaller a lot smaller or more precise  Yeah, and I mean, you know, I don't again whatever the cpc is that you're seeing like  I I don't really there's a whole window installation is not something for what we're teaching  As people shop for it, right they don't just go come over  So if you're going to run ads for it, it's a little more complicated than getting  Just kind of what we teach  But I would tell like  Without even looking at numbers like I would tell your friend you want to give me six grand  I'll do it. You want to give me eight grand? I'll do it  Other than that, that's a month. If not, i'm out  Got it. So and I that's just I don't even know the numbers. I could just think that that's what it would take  And that would maybe give you like fifteen hundred dollars and money to pocket  Yeah, okay. So that that's just off the top of my head  but um  it's like I had a client that is wanting to  Expand into like commercial roofing jobs, which is a whole different beast than like roofing  and  And I was like, okay  Well, you know and they where they live is not close to a metro area  And i'm like, I can't rank your website from where you're at into this metro area  Unless you want to give me some offices for google business profiles  Um, and I said if you want to run ads like that sale it's all about the sales cycle with these ads so like  You talk to your buddy about what's your sales cycle like like when you get somebody how many touches does it take for him to convert?  Now imagine no one even knows who the hell he is, right? So now it's like  This is this is the type of sales cycle where because window replacement is expensive  It's typically not  Unless you just want to do glass replacement for broken windows. That's something that you can maybe do what we do for  Right, but if that's not what",

So what we're what we teach here isn't going to be  As helpful for him  You're going to have to look at  Social media branding ads with retargeting  Facebook pixels display ads with retargeting from google and google search ads that we that we run  And basically he needs to be branded  He's going to need if someone's looking for him or that type of service and they come across his ad  Or his facebook thing you have to build multiple ads that will touch that person probably seven eight nine times  Before maybe they even come visit your site and that's why I said right off the top of my head  I'd be telling the guy  Six to eight thousand dollars a month minimum if he's not interested. I'm not interested  Because it's not worth my time or frustration  Yeah, and that's what it's felt like  It's been more of a frustration for me because I want to help him get some of these things going  But our budget is too tiny for these areas. He wants to and to your point  Being able to really retarget everybody once they've seen something first to be known  Is not happening, you know, so  Yeah, that's like the commercial roofer like this. He wants to do these things and then i'm like, I don't even know  I haven't even looked into it  But i'm like probably anywhere between six and ten grand a month if you want to do it  And you know, he's like, oh that's a lot of money and i'm like, well, that's what those it's  That's not you know, someone's gonna drop like a couple hundred thousand dollars on a roof job  Like they're not just searching google and clicking a button  You know, there's a whole branding to it. There's a whole like social proof to it like  i'm it's the same thing that nick talks about it's like  why we don't recommend kitchen remodeling or home remodeling things like that because  That's not something that somebody calls for someone to come do something simple  And and windows could be that way too because well what type of window?  What do I I want to you know, maybe the wife wants to come look at it and see it in a store and  You know, how does it open? What latch is it all those things? So it's a sale cycle. That's not like  Hey, my water heater broke or hey, I want to get my backyard  some concrete in it or  You know like emergency hvac repair like it's not something that's like a quick easy sale cycle like I need help now  type of thing or  This is such a lower  Like it's such a low cost item that i'm not really worried about  Like shopping around for the best best person  right  Yeah, so I I know that when I talked with this this friend of mine he was saying that his  Average cost is anywhere from six to eight grand for the windows job, right?  So that's usually what he would pay or get paid to do the windows  So in my head, I thought oh, that's a great like, you know, it's high ticket  But it's not I had to get over 15 grand like nick teaches. So you how do I move forward?  How do I best delineate between those two and know that i'm not getting into an industry?  That's just gonna like take my my breakfast and run with it. Yeah  If you're not familiar with like uh, like I mean this happens i've i've done this a lot and I'm kicking myself  like trying to help friends out  but um ",

I was like like I own a home  There's services that I need I kind of like think about  How would I find this person I might ask friends hey if you needed if I don't know i'll ask questions for like other people  um, or go on the chat groups and find like how do you do this or  You know, how would you find this person or whatever?  Um, and then sometimes it's the business owner. You just go. Okay. I hear you. I get it  Like what what's your typical sales cycles like like how does somebody find you?  How many times you have to talk to them like, you know, it's like that  We talk about qualifying them and you what's your close rate?  Like if I gave you 10 leads, how many can you think you'd close?  right  most people if I do 70 you're like bullshit, but if they're like  Yeah, I could probably close like, you know, four or five people. You're like, okay  a little more like that person might understand that there's a cycle to their business and  you know, not everyone's an amazing salesperson, but  It's those kind of questions. You just gotta you just gotta kind of qualify them better and more and understand like what?  Is there a sales cycle and then you got to think about what we're teaching and what we're trying to identify with  um  You know again, fort worth large ass area arlington large area  uh  You're running the just looking at that. I bet you're running that ad to like three million people  Nothing's working for 32 dollars a day at three million people  Yeah, like zero things are going to work for us on that. So you're going to get crappy clicks crappy leads  um  you have a pretty high impression count which  Could be possible, but I bet your display ads might be selected or google search partners. Maybe by mistake  That's that's something to think about  But again, just yeah, this is like, uh, this is something that's not really  What we would want to run here  Um, like I said, it's a multi-touch multi-branded  multifaceted different platforms retargeting  Website pixels like it's a more complicated  Basket that you're weaving the catch leads in  So if I if you were in my shoes  Would you go ahead and just make these ads like really specific to like one or two cities?  With those zip codes instead maybe in an area where the cpc is more in that line  That should be or would you just reach out to the owner and be like hey man  Like I just want you to know this is probably not going to be worth your time  Um  Yeah, I definitely would like get rid of the radiuses and target better spots  And see if you can make something work  But yeah, I would just not have high expectations for them  And I would also tell them you have the data to show you what cpc is  There's no reason to be at 32 dollars a day. That's not even one click  So you want to set yourself up for you know, how many clicks a day to win one click a day is going to do nothing  That's like having one customer walk into your door  If you were selling t-shirts  If you're at a store that you know sold clothing one person a day is not going to do it, right?  You need multiple people because not everyone's going to buy some are just browsing and leaving browsing and leaving but some people will buy  So you need a lot you need more people",

I don't I don't want to have success here  So some of that's just being just looking at the numbers  And it's uncomfortable. I mean like this commercial this guy that wants to do commercial roofing  I know I know he's not going to but i'm not going to try to make it work for him for five bucks  Like you're out of your freaking school. I'm not doing that  I'm not going to put myself in that position make me look bad  Get friction with my friend or my client at all. I'm like, hey, no, this is what it's going to cost to do that  I don't want to like if you're not if you're not willing to invest that i'm not  Because now we're going to be in this spot where you have to like now go. Hey dude, this isn't working  and it's uncomfortable and it feels weird, but  That's just the nature of this like you just got to be  This is just maybe talk to more about a cell cycle  Maybe try to target a couple of those smaller like suburbs and just try to fish in there and make it work for him  But look at your numbers in your search volume and determine  What you think what you know a daily budget should be and a monthly budget  um, one of the things that i've talked about  before with people is like  This is like this isn't like a rule like that you can like you'll find on the internet  I'm sure there's people that have different opinions on it  But like for me when i'm not sure and i'm like, well, I don't know. What's the daily budget going to be?  What's the monthly budget what I like to do is I like to take  the search volume  From like what I find in rare keyword planner  the monthly search volume and I add that up and then  Um  I add that number up and then I divide and then I find like 75% of that  And and the goal and so the thought is that well, I want to try like like I said  I want to bring customers into my door to buy my t-shirt. I need to get a lot so  Out of a hundred people that walk by my store. I want to get like 70 75 of them in my store. Does that make sense?  So that's so that's where that number comes from and it's just a number  I just it just seems to work and then I look at my my uh,  My top of page my highest bid cpc and then I multiply those two numbers together  That should give me a monthly budget and then I divide that by 30  And there and there's your and there's your daily budget and if you set them up like that  That's an easy way you can you can dive in and tweak things and get rid of fort worth and you know  You can make that smaller  But like but you're always going to do it with data and a little more confidence and then by doing it that way  Even if the friend's like, oh, that's too expensive cool  Not my problem. That's not my problem. If you don't want to spend money to make money, that's not my problem  That's a you problem. Not me problem, right?  Hey jeff. Yeah, can you can you go through that formula again? My my laptop cut out when you were saying it. Nope  Just kidding. Thanks",

I know I was on the phone  Whatever multiple clients this morning are like i'm like I got it  Yeah, so I take the the total number of search volume  And I i find like 70 75 percent of that number  And then I take my top of page bid  Okay, I multiply those two numbers together that gives me what the monthly budget would be  And then divide that by 30 just to say average 30 days a month and that will give me a daily budget to shoot for  And then I could tweak it from there  Like he's gonna have a huge daily budget and monthly budget with that many people he's running ads to  So I can now go well, let me just work on  Decatur texas. Okay, that's gonna be this much. Let me just work on mineral wells, texas  That's gonna be this much like then I can like bring my I can maybe think make things work a little bit better for me  If i'm trying to like get my own clients and like, you know, get my own leads and sell them to somebody  It's it helps  You know that formula will help you find these smaller areas and set yourself up for success in them, too  So that way you don't go i'm gonna do a window installation business outside of fort worth  And you're like i'm spending like 50 a day and i'm getting nothing  And when you run the numbers, it's like you should be doing  290 a day and you're like, oh my god, i'm gonna go bankrupt doing that. So so that that formula is more for us  But because you're because you like you're putting your own money out there first trying to get a business owner  But like in your case, you're you're trying to help a you know, a friend who is a business owner  so I kind of use that same formula just to like  Just to even know where I need to have that conversation out because right every business owner  not everybody a lot of business owners are like  Especially if they haven't done digital advertising and or they've been burned or whatever it is like I just want to do this  And spend five dollars  Why can't you why can't you make me millions of dollars if I give you five dollars and you're like, yeah, bro  It doesn't it doesn't work that way  so if you use that data  It just gives you a place of authority and then if there's like a conflict in the conversation you could be like here  Pop on a video boom. This is what google's telling me  What do you what do you i'm not lying to you? Like you can kind of have a little bit  of authority and and um  Just kind of like more of that expertise that like i'm using data to drive this  I don't if you don't want to do it. That's cool, but  I'll find the next guy that wants to make money  But use the data to your advantage  It gives you more confidence to demand money from a guy at a certain amount that you might feel uncomfortable with  Because you're like i'm looking at data  This is what this is just what it's going to cost me in advertising dollars  I'm not even talking about what I want to put in my pocket, right?  So at least then when you speak you speak from a better position of authority  Or and you have a better expectation if this is you were doing this on your own  You can be like, okay. I'm gonna burn like 75 bucks a day this and that but it looks good low-hanging fruit  I'm gonna make some money  Okay, i'm it looks like i'm gonna spend say two grand a month  So I want to sell this deal for",

So like by doing that you set yourself up  To decide if you want to go into a niche or not or an area or not  And then you also give yourself that that expertise and that authority to make a better decision  And to make sure that you know what to sell it for to make money and that's probably more important than  how much it's gonna cost and all that other stuff is like  you know, because there's places i've gone into where i'm like  Like this is gonna be expensive. But damn if I hit i'm gonna make like seven grand on this  You know, like I can make some really good money or I can get into a revenue deal with the guy  you know  so  Yeah, that's really helpful. And I think that that's the the way to go about it with the best metrics for success  You know, you're planning for  Success not just randomness. Yeah. Yeah, just use the data and it's new. I get it  Like you're not you just that's probably your biggest issue here. It's just it's not a high budget  You're running it to probably several million people  and and as a niche it's not a  It's not a it's not a like one and done type of service it's typically a multi-faceted multi-touch deal  Okay, yeah  That's helpful then I'll work on uh narrowing down the cities a little bit more and just having an honest conversation with him  Yeah, my numbers and then also look at the overall budget for that too  Um, and that'll give me to a good spot. Do you can I show you?  Um the site that i'm driving traffic to as well so you can kind of let me know  if you would add some components to it or  Uh, yeah. Yeah if you want  This is what it looks like right now not mobile  He is an interesting window contractor I was gonna say that's cool that you have that uh-huh. Yeah, you have your types of windows  We also do door upgrades but that's just not part of the ads right now  And then quote from the bottom  Yeah, I mean it seems like a simple landing page for people  Yeah  Yeah  Great  Well, i'll go and stop sharing my screen if um, todd wants to jump in here with his questions, but thank you jeff  I appreciate your help.

Um, and then this was the thing that I posted  um, yeah, okay, so base  Basically, I think what i'm trying to find out is is volume  So that's what all this is. These are just screenshots of the volume for all these different sites that I have  Uh, okay. So those different sites didn't show up on that sheet. That's why I was like i'm not sure  Yeah, I didn't want to I didn't want to you're fine. No, no, you're totally fine. It was just like i'm not  Fully, I wasn't just what you showed was not making me fully understand what the data was. I was like, yeah  No, no worries. So this one line four. This is that avondale tree service  Um, that's yours  This is mine. Yeah, okay. And so so what i'm i'm  Again, I think I think my issue with this is I picked one of my sites that has really low  Not low but lower  Called volume. I mean mangos only shows 10  4 000 impressions  Um, and then the ad itself  Looks like this  And again, it's only been since  What yeah, you're you're just out of that first two week thing anyway, so that's not yeah, sometimes that's part of it too  Sure, the first week is always terrible  Second week, it can get better third fourth week. It should keep getting better if you make the right adjustments to it. So, okay  Okay, so i'm looking yeah looking at 16 clicks over the 384 impressions  So basically again, i'm I should just keep it. It just needs to season more it sounds like  Yeah, and like the first week it's like it could be just complete dog crap  That's why we're like to talk because like the first two days is policy then after that it goes to this learning phase and  It'll try to run your ads at a whole bunch of different things and it's testing it out and that's where you know  you need to go in and like  Maybe put things to you know  Go review your search terms and go things to the negative keywords and that's you  Helping google train what you want your ad to kind of focus on and then you can make improvements to headlines  Whatever it is that you want to do and then that's where that second week now is like a week of that  You kind of do the same thing and typically after two adjustments  Most you're you're kind of pointing in that right direction and then beyond that it's just fine tuning it really  Okay, um, so that's why I always say it's just the first two weeks are just kind of like  I always tell business owners like hey man, the first month is not going to be awesome  I'm just going to be straight with you  The first two weeks are completely out of my hands because that's just google doing google  um, and i'm going to do this and this and we'll start seeing things the third fourth week and  That almost always works and when that almost always works  I've established myself as authority and expert and then we're good. We're great sailing from there  Okay, okay  So then yeah  And then the other question I had is is it typical that because cpc when I first started was like 490 or something  It jumped up to 839  Um is i'm assuming that's kind of typical right that it fluctuates or yeah, especially in trees trees will have a wild swing  Yeah, and it's weird that you think like oh, it's the winter time and it gets more expensive in the winter time  And then it dips and then it gets more expensive again  Like",

Um  So this one's local to me would be that's the towing woodbury tree care now mango shows a volume of 80  It's a little bit higher in cpc right now. And again, it's up here in minnesota. So we're just getting into  Well, you guys also have trees up there  Yeah a lot. In fact, yeah, it's like okay. Are you familiar with arizona like where avondale is?  I grew up in uh, yeah, I started planting a church in buckeye. Yeah, okay. So yeah, i'm from tempi  I'm from tempi. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So that's going to be an issue with arizona, right?  It's going to be residential people with their trees and  Yeah, so you're you're not going to have as many  People just by the fact that they just don't have  You know people don't typically have big ass shade trees out there, right?  Right, yeah  And so this one is like I said, it's local up here in minnesota and it's again mangles has it higher cpc is a little bit higher  but the volume  Should last last season. I didn't have any ads joining to it. It was just you know, it's number one  It's on page one of google  And I had a couple of  I had a couple of calls coming in monthly never was able to lock anybody down  So considering doing this for the season  Running some ads to get this one boosted. I have two business owners that said talk to me next year  Yeah for that for that site. So so so that page one rank that those are your sites ranking on page one  Yeah, yeah, like  Yep  Like all my towing sites are in the map pack and those are all sold already. So that's great. Good job, man  Yeah, I would say then like  One oh good the what go ahead  I was gonna say like for that avondale one like I would just really  If it's really that low search volume and you're on page one and you're ranking for big terms  Like I just keep going for the organic play there and I wouldn't waste my money  Personally, if i'm ranking one on like multiple keywords or in the map pack for things that to me would just be like  Well, i'm my stuff's already there. Why do I need to keep paying for it? Right?  Yes, this is me right here. Yeah, I would just maybe try to work on getting some more reviews to it  Yeah, but look at number three same thing  um, so I yeah, I would I I think you're  Yeah, that's what I that would that's why I would put my time and money into it  just to try to rank it for other keywords in the area and  Just it's either gonna get clicks or not  Yeah, so maybe that low search volume it's just gonna save you money  Yeah, that's that's where i'm at right now. So i'm i'm really leaning toward really kicking into that tree this this tree care  one  because that's that's uh  um  Hold on  I  Think i'm in map pack there too. Yeah, that's right here number one and organic. It's awesome. Yeah. Yeah",

Yeah, 13 maybe depending on how they're displaying it. It's pretty damn good odds  That you'll get some clicks that way. So that's something that you can supplement really good seo with  Especially if you know there's value to it  Okay, yeah  Yeah, and that and that will help reduce your overall ad spend and make it work in a in a better way  for you  Right. Okay. So just just to recap probably  um  Folk get more reviews on the avondale tree service and then the other tree service one run a couple of ads  keyword specific  Mm-hmm  I think and I also i'm trying to get break into the concrete world, but uh,  I got to do more due diligence on that. So, okay  Yeah, yeah, thanks. Yeah. Yeah, no problem. Uh, yeah keep it out. You're doing great on the seo stuff  That's that's the long-term play right? Yep. So yeah, I think that's the long-term play  The ads thing is great to get it going fast and also to like when things are slow  You can supplement with ads and like again, it can just get you  You know like a nick talks about in the sales about you know, it's like just it's about monopoly, right?  The best way to the best chances of winning the game and monopoly is owning the most properties on the board  And yeah, that's exactly what I was just saying  You just you can really be specific about certain jobs that you want certain types of services that you want  You can run them on top of where you're already ranking number one for  Um, but you can use the ads and you can be very specific on the keywords that you select  Including just doing exact match and you're you could just be like  Okay, i'm not doing really good on like say commercial tree services and I want to do that  So i'm going to run ads just there and maybe i'll get a job here and there from it  Cool, yeah  Uh, or I want to boost tree removal  And so i'm going to run an ad for that for this month and let it sit on top of my organic rankings  And now I got three freaking shots at getting someone to click on my stuff  Yeah, that's pretty that's pretty dang cool  Okay  Thanks, man. Yeah, no problem. Great job  Uh, I think I saw Janelle next I see your hand up  Hi jack, hi, how you doing?  We're back  You're back. Yeah  Um, well, thanks. It's good to be on here again and I will try my best to keep it concise. Um  We uh have that it's a similar the same business owner. We were talking about before ",

So because we already picked that um, and we have a paying business owner and he's working with us and all that  Working with us and all that. Um, but we got a much bigger budget this time from him is willing to pay more  um  We're not running ads on new work tree service. We created two other websites for him danville and castro valley location, which are near us  New work's the only one we've been able to get a gbp on or gmb on  Um having a lot of trouble with gmb's lately  I don't know if everyone else is experiencing this in the last three months, but it's been auto suspensions appeal denials like everything  um  So just haven't gotten one to go through in a while  um  So we are now running an ad to castro valley tree service to that site for him. It's one of the newer sites  um, and  I just have some questions about the campaign and i thought I was just saying like i'd love to see your um  Some of your keywords if you wouldn't mind sharing because the click through it. It's brand new  We just launched a week and a half ago and I know it takes a couple weeks  But um, can I share with you and show you my screen on what we're seeing?  Absolutely  All right  And then the other thing is I get a little lost because I I think I created too many mcc's and so it's  Kind of having a hard time figuring out which is which so i'm sure I did it wrong  And then it's telling me that one of my accounts needs to be verified, but I don't think it's the one that's running  Um this this ad  Um, it's got a different account number  Okay, so let me see if I can find it really quick so castro valley tree service  Gosh, sorry. It's gonna just do this whole thing. Um  And then we got like  It stopped running our ad two days ago and it said something like we we had reached the max  Threshold or something and it only charged us 18 dollars and 20 cents  Um, and I was having a hard time finding where to do the payment  Um, and we've set our max budget to fifty six dollars and sixty six fifty six sixty six a day  Um, and I was kind of in line with what google was recommending. It wasn't the high end and it wasn't the low end  It was like right there  um  So it's telling you that it was like limited by budget  It said something about my threshold had been exceeded  So I put through a ten dollar payment or 18 20 18 20 and it looks like it's back up, but it wasn't  Right, like i'm still let's see. Hold on. You might have put a cap on it. Maybe like some people put like a monthly budget on it  Okay, if I did I didn't know that I was setting that up and yeah, I mean may not have I just  Yeah, what you're saying i'm trying to I can't remember last time I even saw something like that. So like it's not  Yeah, it was a weird thing at the top and I was like, what is this name?  Uh, it wasn't a big balance. So it looked like so that was the day like shut off. We got nothing  and then  Um, it's picking back up and let's see you started  You started it that could have just been a click, uh, a glitch in the matrix, too  I've had like i've woken up to like alerts that like this got suspended and that and I go on and i'm like",

I don't know what the heck that was like i've had weird like I just call them glitches in the matrix sometimes  Okay  Um, so we have gotten one call yesterday for this ad  But obviously not expecting to see much and it does look like I didn't see it today, but it looks like it's picked up  Um yesterday, so we got 14 clicks. I'm not using a lot of keywords. Um  I tried doing some negative keywords our score on optimization  I tried doing some of your old stuff that I saw like where you could say skip and skip  Doesn't let you do that anymore. Like it actually wants me to do this stuff  Really? Yeah, it wants me to do callouts. It wants me to do that. I do that all the time  It sends them back to you, but I just get rid of them  So it wants me to do conversion tracking dads. Nope. Do not do that  I know you guys will you just hit dismiss just tell it to piss off. They'll cut it. They'll  They're always going to try to make money from you. Just hit this  Just hit it. Yep. Bye. Okay back. They'll bring it back in a week. Big deal. Bye. Okay. I didn't see the dismiss. Thank you  And then should I be doing site links on ads? Do you recommend those? Yeah, it helps add some more  Um real estate to the ad if you have a full page if you have a one pager, no  Yeah, we have a one pager. Yeah, yeah, then you're not going to be able to do it. So don't do it  Okay, and that was a question that I had about the ad we're just doing one campaign one ad group  But it's tree service. So I was wondering do you think we should do an ad group for tree removal an ad group for tree trimming an ad  Group for like the different keywords or just keep them all in one  Um, what's what's the population you're running this to?  140 oh, let's see castro valley. I can't  65 000  Okay, are you running a radius or just a casserole just castro valley right now?  But we got a call from union city yesterday, which is a neighboring city  okay, so  And this is right along the bay, right?  Yeah, we're in the bay area. Um, it's near oakland  Yeah, but uh, let's see. So there's like union city and castro valley  San lorenzo san liandro some of those other areas  Uh, wait, oh, that's actually oakland castro  No, it's next to oakland. It's next to oakland. Okay. Yeah, I think my sister used to live. Oh, yeah  No, no, my sister lived just north of that. Sorry. Okay. Yeah  Okay, so I would okay so  65 000 people that's fine. I I don't think you need to run different ad groups  If you're in a more populated area, yes  That's part of the reason why we say don't do california  Because you have to set up more of an expert ad  Yeah  Okay  Does the optimization optimization score do anything for your ad or is it just  It doesn't always have to stay at 100 but yeah the higher it is the better it is just  If you go like if you go to the left and hit recommendations, that's going to tell you  All the stuff they recommend at the top left dish  Okay, hold on top left column. Yeah, you'll see or it says overview recommendations and site reports. Yep  Yeah, it was like call outs and site links and yeah, so",

They are going to spend all of your money every day  They're going to do it. You if you want to do that, that's great. But like  Even if I set an ad up for seventy five dollars a day  um, I typically don't run seventy five dollars a day unless i've like  Massively misjudged it but if I do if I set it up to do the conversion  It it'll always run my seventy five dollars a day  So that's kind of I don't really recommend doing it for what we're doing  Yeah, so yeah, you can just go here. You can just dismiss it hit the three dots hit dismiss watch your ad score go up  Okay, cool. Um  Like any of the recommendations, yeah, i'll just say oh I can just do dismiss all  I'll do it later  Yeah, okay. It's going up. Okay. I'll play with that later. I'll just just dismiss everything  Um, do we want just to save you a step you see the three dots next to the 4.3?  Yeah, click that just dismiss all and then hit dismiss. There you go. One less click for you to do. Okay. Okay  Um now any of these recommendations that we should actually do  Um, no, okay  All right  and then  Can I just especially not if you don't have like a if you just want to if you're running to one page or no  When you start getting to adding a full website  adding site links and call outs can be  Helpful in the fact that your ad might take up more real estate on certain displays  And if they give you more real estate to display your ad that typically means one more person's ad isn't going to show  So there's a tactical advantage to it. Is it necessary? Absolutely not  If you want to go through the hassle of it, you're more than welcome to it's not a negative thing  but you don't do it with a one pager because you don't have the urls for it, but um,  It's more of a real estate game than it is about like getting more conversions  Yeah, and we'd probably have to create different landing pages for each keyword and we have them all on one right now. So  just simpler  um, we don't have a ton of  keywords, but I just put some of the top ones and I've  um  This is not the keywords I picked. I don't know. I had like only seven  and then  Overview will show me what people are searching right if I look down here  Top searches  um  And then keywords  So I did  I I haven't done the negative keywords in a while, but I did put how to diy  Free all that stuff some of the brand name tree services are like, you know the big business  Yeah, can you leave this here for a second? I'm gonna i'm gonna scroll on a second tangent  So for jason who asked this question earlier  When we're looking right here, you can see in the negative keyword list. You can see how some of them are exact match  Some of them are broad match. Um  I if I remember correctly, there's no phrase match. Um  Negative keywords nor do you want that?  And the difference is that when you go to your search terms and you see a search term like anr tree service anvil tree service  And you select it and you say send to the negative keyword list  That's that term goes over as an exact match  Versus here where she typed in diy do it yourself  For free how",

Okay  Sorry, thank you  While you're here, I just thought I didn't want to ignore his comment. So of course  Yeah, everyone has like a lot of the same questions and stuff. So yeah, okay, so that's good  So you've you've gone through your search terms. That's great. That's what you need to do  um  Yeah, I I do wonder  If um, let's see you have you see it's  Saying not eligible my campaign is paused  Uh-huh  okay, so okay where it says  Sorry where it says like uh add callouts to your account all that like get rid of that  That window or whatever you want to call it there, yeah, okay, so you're looking at all campaigns right now  So you had two campaigns you had one that's paused one. That's not okay  So if we want to yeah, that's all if you want to go to the one that's running just just uh, no  Don't do that. I don't want that one  It's fine. It's not doing anything. Just leave it there  I i'm not a big fan of deleting stuff on google ads. So just leave it just hit pause  It just stays so now what we want to do is we want to look at go back to your campaigns  Sorry, I didn't mean to freak you out. Okay. So yeah now just click the one that's open click that just click it  Now that'll take you to the next one. Now you can look at now look at the top  Keeps bringing that that damn window for you. Um, now you can see okay. So now notice how now you have that campaign  Yeah, okay. So now you can even you can select an ad group if you had multiple ad groups  Which which is fine. Now you can look at keywords  Uh, no problem. Todd. We'll see you later  Right here. You can look. Uh, yes, and now that should be under this ad group. See how  Yeah, see you at the top. Yeah. Okay. Now you shouldn't see that  that  Okay, is that helpful sometimes when you see stuff? That's weird  What I like to do is I look at the top where it says search keywords and it has that like that's that's  Like right there. See how you go above that. See how it says you all campaigns what campaign and what ad group?  Yeah, so if I if i'm ever looking at my I call it the spreadsheet section and i'm like  This doesn't make sense to me. I typically go up and go. Oh, I forgot to select that  Um, and the other place you can get in trouble is on like the top of the spreadsheet  Where the plus sign is and I call it the little martini glass you have the filters  Sometimes people don't realize they added a filter to it if you go down go down  Go down go down right right right there. See I have the little martini  So sometimes people do a filter and they forget and they're like I can't find this and this isn't looking and I go  Well, your filters are turned on so you have to turn those off and then the other common one is the date range  So just fyi, so if you ever find yourself or you're like what i'm looking at doesn't make sense  um, that's just a just an fyi for you just uh  Just check those things and typically that you'll be able to sort out what you're not seeing  Yeah, it typically like for some reason it always goes back to the last date  I looked at and then i'm like wait,",

Okay, so here's something that's interesting  So you have a lot of impressions?  And a lot of clicks at really really really cheap cpc  My gut is that you have display network on and search partners on  I turned it off. But can we look maybe where I go for that?  Uh should be in your settings  For your campaign campaign settings  Sorry, tell me where to go just go to campaigns  You're gonna go to the settings just hover over it  Hover over the yep. See the little yep. Okay  I'm having a hard time finding places. I get lost. Okay. Yeah right there networks google search network search partners display an hour  Shoot, I thought it's okay. It's super easy to super easy to miss. So go ahead save  I did it on that other campaign  That was the other castor valley and then I couldn't find it when I went to create it the draft. So that's why I did this other one  Yeah  Okay, so that's gonna help  That's that could be your number one issue right now  Okay. Yeah, we had a really it was saying the cpc was really low  Yeah, that's that's because you're yeah, and that's because you're running display ads and search partner ads  Uh, okay  And then audiences we just did castor valley now that you know, it's 63,000 and our budget is 56 a day  We try doing your calculation the 75 percent time, you know all that. Yeah for the main keywords. Um  But we're just not getting a lot of data in castor valley or even big cities near us  Like a lot of stuff is there's no cpc  Uh for our keywords, so we did the best we could  So  Okay, yeah, no, I think you're so I think that's your biggest issue was that  Okay, it's just that it's not firing where you want it to fire  All right. So now that'll be changed so that that should help you out  A lot and todd is off. But I mean these are all I have for keywords  Yeah, if that's what you saw in the data then that's what you use  Okay  But I think right now it's just like you got 230 impressions like I doubt that many I doubt that's your monthly search volume at all  Yeah, it's like 10  on each word  so you're not going to get a lot of you're not going to get a lot of action in that city, but  You'll get action which is good and it's california. So you don't want to get into competitive areas  So just hang tight where you're at and now that you made that  I think that was the biggest factor was you're just accidentally left the display network and search partners on  Okay, and then that's why your clicks are probably crappy and you're like, I don't get it  I'm getting clicks, but no one's calling or they're they're just clicking display ads and stuff and those are typically robots at night  Okay, and then um  Do you think we were going to try and put a logo on the ad but it makes me do advertiser verification  How hard is that?  The advertiser verification process well if it forces you there's a well  Them trying to get a logo out of you is different than  Them forcing you to do advertiser verification. So I just dismiss it  If you but if you make up a logo for him, you can put a logo in there  I mean we have one  But I I didn't want to have to do the whole advertiser verification because it was",

Um, i'm the agency so I always use it as like i'm an agency  Okay, yeah rather than the business because then it's like now you have to get paperwork from the business  Do all that stuff and that could get weird it's easier to say yeah, I run my I run a small digital marketing agency  Yeah, okay. Got it. And then last question for you is  Should we be so he has the business owner has his own website  His website is you know been around a while. It's not getting any it's not doing great in the rank and rent industry  But we're wondering if it would be better to run some run the ad to his website  It's been around a lot longer and create a landing page off of this  As opposed to running him to castro valley our our rank and rent site  Or our landing page that's on our rank and rent site, but hidden  That makes sense  um  I mean  Because we don't have a gmb yet on castor valley  Where is our landing page? Yeah, but that's that's gonna just be  That that's an seo thing. That's not really  An ad worry. Yeah, not really an ad worry about it. But yeah, I I wouldn't um  Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can do either one but I mean I would keep my own assets  Okay, so run it to ours if we're running the ad to a landing page. Well, never mind. Just hang on. Um  We have a we have two tracking numbers. We have the you know, the organic going to our website and then we have the landing page  Um for the ad that has a different phone number. So we're tracking like what's coming from what?  And then yeah, okay  Because we'd have to build a landing page off of his page with a different phone number because this is actually going to him  Yes, he won't be okay  Um, hey matt if you're listening any other questions i'm just asking my husband. Is that it pretty good?  Okay, maybe he's not on uh  Okay, cool. So just try that for a while and maybe expand to a few more cities if we're not getting a lot  Yeah, be careful with that area  Yeah expensive just make sure before you even expand it. I would run every little city every zip code has its own  Due diligence just so you know what you're getting into  56 a day is really not a lot in california for  ads, you know  So, you know just just take that for whatever it's worth it  At the end of the day, there's not a lot of search volume in the city that you're finding which is fine  um  But the the other factor is that your ads weren't running to google search ads. They were running to other places  So it's kind of giving you a false sense of what's going on. So great. Okay. Yeah  Yeah, and oh now we're getting to the page bit. You're in united. No, you're in the united states. Okay. There we go  Yeah, so because I was just there was blank data  So when we tried to figure out what's an appropriate budget we just we could only do it for a couple few words  So we just assumed it was going to be that much for the other",

No, that's fine. And your search volume's so low that I wouldn't be worried about it. You can see fluctuations in the search volume  um  So yeah, i'm not that familiar with that city  So it could just be that maybe there's just not a lot of trees there  But I kind of think that area has a lot of trees, right?  There's a lot and the crazy thing is when I do it impressions is above three thousands  3000 but it's saying 10  That's search volume but your impressions we're going to  Display ads and search networks. That's that's a whole other beast. You just  They will span the shit out of the web the internet on with your stuff like you had stuff running ads on  Um, like on people's games  You know, they could run like a free game and it shows you an ad you had you your ads were showing there  to like take a kid playing like  Block blast or some I don't know gold digger game out whatever the hell the kids are playing  But like that's what your ads are running to in that area when you have display network and other stuff on  So that would affect what we saw in the forecast because we were under that campaign when we were searching in keyword planner  Oh, that's why in the budget was showing such a low cpc  And a high impression, oh, okay interesting we're like, why are these impressions so high it should only be like 1500  Let's see. It's you know, it's united states. Okay. All right united states again. Yep  Seven point two thousand that makes no sense  Because newark, which is a bigger city used to be like around fifteen to two thousand  So, I don't know that's funky  Uh forecasting Brian. Oh, okay. No, that's fine. Uh, no you bring that back what you're doing  I know go back to where you were. I'll I'll show you something that's let's try to look at something differently there  All right, so see where it says match type for a keyword it says all keywords maximize clicks and then  Match type.

Yes, that's 57, which is what you have. So you're you're right there  Okay, it's just a lot of impressions  More than I expect to see for those this city  Yes  Yeah, but this is where like, you know in the past people, you know  Well, you know simrush shows this mangle shows that keyword planner shows this, you know  rare is really good because rare brings up rare will bring up your  Like google keyword data, right or google keyword planner data.

Let me see  Uh digital ad doi how to for yes, you did that manually  Okay, is that something you guys recommend? I haven't made it through all the ad things yet  It's not something that we like teach that you have to do but like it's something i've i've gone over with people like  these are some changes you should make and do but it's  it's uh  Um  There's some negative keywords that you'll just understand you just add like free cheap  do it yourself  you know this but there's like there's some areas that like  like  um  Let me say like like how much would uh, like how much would it cost to have my tree? Yeah  okay, so like I would say that um  like for me  Like in one area that might work for me where maybe I do like like with janelle like she doesn't have a lot of  Search volume  So maybe allowing that question is not a bad thing because it maybe gets my site one more rep  But if I was running that ad in a larger city  I maybe don't want to have I don't want to spend nine dollars for someone to ask the question about how much something costs  so I don't really teach it as you have to do it because  People are running ads in towns of 30 000 people and like you're doing it for 4 million people, right?  So like it so it's gonna be different like it'll be different. So I try to not  Like this is how it has to be done. It's more of like guidelines  You could do this if it makes sense for you  But there's small small population areas where like I don't mind if people call because there's not a lot of not a lot of search volume  There's not a lot of competition  So if my business owner is getting people on the phone  Calling and asking them questions or sending in a form asking questions.",

But yeah, so  Because I see a lot of it not a straight answer but like that's why yeah that checks out  It's a lot of in my search terms section. It's a lot of like how much do windows cost?  How much to replace the window how much this or price this so I can see if it was a strategic way to  how get more views that's a that's okay, but  It's a lot of variations of those  Yeah, and where you're running your ads out like this would be like  like  Because you're running it to like a super major metro area millions of people  Um, I would maybe talk to my business owner and go hey man, i'm seeing like this is a lower cost item  Let's build you a landing page  Let's build a sales funnel where we start collecting people's info and bring them through like a lead form type of thing  To get a higher quality lead that's asking questions about how much something costs  Got it. That's the thought right now all of a sudden  Maybe that's a value now becomes maybe in a large area. It's an easy thing to break through the noise  Someone's like well how much would it cost? Oh, you know, thanks for clicking our ad  Like let's get some let's give you a good quote. How big's your house?  How many windows you have how many are you interested in this or this and all of a sudden you're just bringing them through  And if that person's serious, they're going to click through you may give them a freaking quote right there  over the computer  And they're like, okay  then now they have a range and now you're like maybe before you give them that hey give us your phone number or an email and  We'll send you a quote right now  Boom, and you set up a bot that sends an email and a text and it sends your business owner or something  But that's like super advanced  That's why we don't teach metro area stay away from that until you like understand that stuff  Some people will get that and be able to do that. But like again, that's like I said earlier  What would I tell your friend?  How much I would run it's going to be thousands of dollars a month. I'm gonna want from that guy, but that's why  Those are the things that we'll do to help them convert. Yeah  That's very helpful. Yeah, no problem  And cool. All right, chris. Are you there?  Give me a chance to get back on let me see here she google sheet by the way  Oh, yeah, that was pretty cool. Huh laura  Uh, jason, I think we answered your question on keywords, I hope  um  Cool. All right  Let me see no chris. All right, josh, you have any other questions at all? I do just one more  Phrase match so I saw in the training that you teach to use the phrase match as  Or keywords. Do you get into exact match as well?  Oh, yeah. Yeah, there's nothing wrong with using exact match. It's just that  when you're  When you're running to the smaller cities and towns we're not typically running against like a bunch of ad experts  so  You don't really need to have the variation. I will I do tell people like if you're going to do like  Tree trimming near me  I would make that an exact match because  Even though the phrase match tree trimming will cut will  May land land an ad for that.

I made a mistake  There's six months down. I just wasted six months on this website, right?  Or there's nobody in this area that wants to do it or their search volume's really bad or whatever it might be  With the ads you're getting that yes or no so fast that it's worth the extra couple hundred dollars  Than it is to be like you either learn a mistake really fast  You learn that this area sucks really fast  uh, and it could just be like I mean there's a lot of places that i've gone to that i'm like  on paper it checks out  and i've done this in the past where I I learned first to like build and rank and then rent it out and  I would get like  All the numbers are here my ads this I are like my my website's here all this stuff  I cannot get a business owner at all and take my leads because they're so fat and happy  And so like nobody's like why why would I why would I uh pay you i'm i'm booked out 18 months in advance  And then you find out that like shit. There's just not a lot of contractors in this area  Or there's they have so much work that they're not worried about even they're  Works waiting on them, right people are waiting on them. And so then you go. Oh shit. Okay, so  You know making that mistake on an seo thing  Is very frustrating because I have several sites that rank really well and still give occasional lead here and there  Like  I couldn't give it away. I can't give it away to people  I've I have one where I had a guy that was driving four hours for certain jobs because they were that valuable  I mean we're talking like  300 000 jobs the guy's like yeah, i'll do that. I'm like, okay  But it's like he's not going to take every lead, you know  So it's just things like that. We're like i'm like, this is ridiculous. So  By by doing nick's method, I would have done that first there. I would have test built a one pager  Tested it out gotten some leads. I would have found that answer very fast and been like, okay  Maybe this isn't hey, I don't want to spend my time and money here  You know, you know, maybe i'll put it on the back burner come back to it in six months. Does that make sense?  So it does yeah, it's very helpful  Yeah, so that's why i'm just doing that to try to help you guys  Understand the due diligence part, but then because when the when the program was first created  We were using smart campaigns which were actually smart  Which actually understood your broad match keywords and your website and understood that like  Who you were and what you were trying to do and it pointed you in that direction  So it was really",

We got to let these guys know, or these ladies, guys, whatever, we got to let them know why  we're calling and why it's important they listen to us because we're interrupting their  day.  They do not want to be interrupted.  You got to give them a damn good reason, and it better be different than everybody else.  Now I do want to mention this.  I know that in this entire process, as I've talked about, and I've mentioned this before,  that we talk about the transition at the end of the hook, but there's also miniature transitions  in between each step, and so here's what's cool about this, is after in the first step  when you ask the three questions, you pattern, interrupt, tell them who you are, typically  what's going to happen is the business owner at some point is going to cut you off and  go, wait, wait, who are you?  Basically what they're saying is, who the hell are you, why are you calling me?  You didn't mention who you are, are you a real estate agent, are you a contractor trying  to send me work, is this your house?  They're going to ask something of that version, or some version of that, and that's going  to be a perfect opportunity for you to just segue, transition directly into what you're  doing.  Here's the steps you're going to follow.  Once they ask that, let's pretend that they do that.  What we're going to do now, and when we're explaining this, we're going to ask a couple  things.  We're going to say a couple things.  First of all, we're going to tell them our name, and we're going to tell them that we  have a website in this city.  Then we're going to tell them that we do not have a company, but that we have jobs.  We don't have a tree company, per se.  We don't do tree work, we don't do concrete work, but we have jobs coming in every single  week.  Then we're going to tell them that we call them specifically because we saw that they  were paying for leads, or paying for ads, or paying for whatever, or did this.  We know that that means they're hungry to grow, and then we're going to transition into  the deal.  What does that look like?  We get done, they're like, hey, so who are you?  Oh, sorry.  By the way, Jack, my name is Nick.  The reason I'm calling you is because I have a website here in Austin, here in, we want  them to know that we're local, I have a website here in Austin that gets three to five concrete  jobs every single week, and I don't do concrete.  I have a website here in Austin, here in St. George, here in whatever, and I don't do concrete,  but it's getting X amount of jobs.  If you don't have a site already, you're just doing a pre-sell, don't say more than three  to five, because three to five is a really safe number that you're going to expect off  of ads.  If you have a site that's been producing for years, and this sucker's pulling in 20 a week,  go ahead and say it, but let's not oversell this from day one.  Let's not oversell at all, but especially not from the first conversation.  Hey, I",

The reason I'm specifically calling you, Jack, is I noticed you're paying for Google Ads,  so I know that you are hungry to grow, or at least I assumed you would like a job.  I assumed you'd be happy to take on this job that I have, I have this lady named Janet,  whatever.  That's it.  We're just going to, and this step right here, we have to let them know why we are calling,  what we're doing.  Got to give them that reason.  Those are the main things that I like to hit is, they're going to cut you off in the middle  of step one, transitioning to step two, they're going to ask who the hell you are, and you're  literally just going to tell them, hey, sorry, Jack, my name's Nick, I have a website here  in Bentonville, Arkansas.  Don't say Arkansas, because that makes it sound like you're out of state.  I have a website here in Bentonville, it's getting three to five concrete jobs every  single week.  I specifically found you on purpose, because I saw you're paying for Google Ads, so I  already know you're hungry to grow, and I'm looking for someone to take on these jobs,  or I'm looking to work with somebody on an ongoing basis.  I don't actually have a concrete company.  You notice how when I explained that the first time, and now I explained it the second time,  I said that differently, but it was the exact same thing.  It's not about saying the exact phrase, and by the way, I'm going to give you guys, there's  going to be a PDF, there's going to be an exact script that you can follow, but I want  you to notice, you can say things multiple ways, and still convey the same message.  Sometimes I'll first tell them I don't have a company, but I have jobs, sometimes I have  jobs coming in, and I'll forget to mention I have a company.  The main point is, you want to be honest and direct and say, hey, I don't have a company,  I got jobs coming in, I have a job right now that's hot as hell, it's ready to go.  Notice how I didn't even said that.  This is my third time kind of explaining it, and this is the first time I'm saying I have  a specific job right now.  I don't want you guys to stress so much.  I'm going to give you the exact script, I just want to break down the important points  to hit.  We talked about the first part, which is who you are.  The second part is why you're calling them.  You have to have a good reason, and it has to make sense.  What makes sense to me, if I put myself in their shoes, is, hey, this kid has a website,  he's getting jobs, he doesn't actually have a concrete company, and he's calling me because  I'm already spending money on ads so he knows that I'm hungry.  That makes sense to me.  By the way, Jack, I have this lady named Janet, she's at Silver Beach Circle, she needs a  tree removed.  This is where we're going to transition into the deal.  And so, I have this lead, her name's Janet, that's our transition.  We're going to then transition into the third step.  So guys, don't overthink it, I just want you to get through these videos.  In the last video",

I know the steps, I know the things, you have to tell them who you are, you have to tell  them what you're doing, what the deal is, you have to transition.  But sometimes they're out of order, and it's okay because it sounds more natural.

    "pageContent": " Another common question we get is, how long should we wait before you kill or stop a campaign?  So this is assuming that you've set up your ad correctly, that you did the proper due  diligence and you selected the right city and the right niche.  So assuming that those things are correct.  Remember that when we set up an ad campaign, the first two days is a policy review and  then the first five days after that is called a learning, it's in its learning phase.  So the first seven days of a new campaign is never really the best results that you're  wanting to get because Google is learning your ad.  So at a bare minimum, we say at least 14 days because that gives you at least one week of  landing your ads where they should be starting to land and you can start making any tweaks  and stuff like that.  For most of us that do this, we let our ads run from beginning to maybe when we're going  to pull it for three to four weeks after launch date because we like to have two full  weeks of running the ads out of the learning and the policy review phase.",

    "pageContent": " Amazing guys. Welcome to the call. All three of you. I don't care if there's one of you. I don't care if there's zero of you because there's going to be a replay guys. I'm going to talk about when to go for the kill and by the kill. I mean the clothes.  This is a question that came up. This is a question we cover in the training.  For sure, at least once probably have covered it more more than once, but it's something that I do want to just reiterate because it's important. So today I was at the gym.  I saw one of our students, Mr. Vance Rowley, who is somebody I've known for a long time, actually went to school with him, know his whole family, the whole thing, and he just recently joined. He's been looking for something new.  He just barely sold one of his old business and has been kind of peeking at stuff for a while and finally decided to join. And he has hooked a business owner, got rid of that business owner, hooked another business owner, given them three leads.  And then we were just at the gym today in between sets kind of talking about like when to go for the deal. And he didn't even ask. He knew the answer, but I just kind of made sure to remind him of these facts.  So what I want to talk about today is when is the right time to go for the kill? When is the right time to go for the close? So some of this stuff is going to be stuff that you already know.  Some of this stuff is going to be maybe some stuff that you don't know and some stuff that I've just kind of discovered over the years after doing this hundreds of times.  Now, the first thing I want to cover is how many leads do we actually send to the business owner? Well, there's a couple of rules because there's no exact number of leads because each individual situation is different.  Each business owner is some business owners are more ready than others, some are less ready than others. However, there are some certain rules that I personally follow.  And again, guys, I've closed a lot of deals in my day and I have I have a very, very high close percentage because quite frankly, I only get on deals that I can close and that's just how I roll.  I go and find the ones that are closeable and then I get on them and I close them.  Okay, so rule number one with the number of leads. I never, ever, ever, ever send more than five leads. Now I remember Eugene Song.  He's an old dog in the game. By the way, Stephanie Prather, how are you? Happy Friday. Congrats on your deal.  Once again, I know you got it a week or so ago, a week or two ago. Eugene Song was a prime example.  He was in another program. He knew me from there. And I remember we jumped on a call.  I was called. I called him on the way to Vegas. I just remember this for some reason right before Christmas.  And he said, dude, I'm like, I've been sending people leads like crazy. It's like I sent Alaska like two weeks worth of leads.  I said, well, you're doing it wrong. You're sending way too many leads.  Guys, anything that you give away, if you give it away in too much abundance, it loses its sizzle.  It gets it. The newness, the magic of it is gone. Right.  Anything that you give away too much, it's too available, is no longer magic.  So I was like, you're giving away too many leads. Guys, I never give away more than five leads. ",

    "pageContent": "Never, ever, ever, ever give away more than five leads. Okay.  Second rule. You do not have to wait for a business owner to close a deal in order for you to go for the close and to close a deal.  They do not have to close one of your leads for you to get the deal. Does it help? Yes. Does it help tremendously? Yes.  Can you control it? No. You do not have to wait for a business owner to close one of your leads to go for the deal.  Okay. A step further than that, you don't even have to wait for the business owner to actually give the estimates before you go for the deal and you can get the deal.  I would say that's a bit more advanced. I would probably wait until the business owner has run the estimates.  But there was a time back in late 2021 when we were cooking and moving at such velocity and we had so much momentum that I remember we would send, we would call, we'd send two leads.  And if I felt in my gut, this person's ready, I was scheduling the Zoom call and I was closing it.  They would call the business, they would call the homeowner, they would schedule the appointment, but they would not even get to the house and I would close the deal.  Okay. You do not have to wait for them to close a deal. You do not even have to wait for them to actually give an estimate.  I would recommend if you've not gotten a deal or you're not getting a few deals, let them get the estimates, but you do not have to wait for a deal to close.  Next rule, if they close a deal at any point on lead number one, number two, number three, number four, go for the kill.  As soon as you, if you send one lead and they close it, it's time to go.  Time to go. One is good. If the first one they close, it's done. Go for it. They've seen enough, they've tasted enough.  It is time to go for the deal. Those are my three rules. Okay. No more than five.  You don't have to wait for them to close a deal and as soon as and if slash as soon as they do close a deal, it's game time.  Those are my three real rules. Now, on top of that, I want you guys to understand that this is, this is an art.  This is something that you're going to have to feel and understand within your gut.  You're going to get this. You're going to do this enough times that you're going to kind of get sensitive to win and pick up these cues of when people are actually ready to go.  And they're going to start asking buying questions and they're going to start talking in a way that lets you know that they are excited and they're going to start.  They're almost going to start moving themselves through the process without you even having to do it.  And those are the people you got to catch them, man. You got to catch them before it gets late.  So I was telling Vance today at the gym, I said, dude, he was trying to get this deal locked up before Wednesday or before Thanksgiving.  He tried to schedule the zoom. And so I was following up. I had it go. He's like, dude, they went out of town. So no problem. It happens.  But I said, remember, every day that passes from here on out, the chances of you closing that deal becomes worse and worse and worse because they are hot.  He told me some of the things they've said. He said that it's a husband and wife. The wife was like super excited and brand new.  She was saying that",

I said, dude, it's time to go. Time to close this deal.  Every minute you wait from now on, you're losing. It's a lower chance of you getting the deal.  So there is a time. There is a point where it becomes you're waiting too long.  And it kind of reminds me when I grew up on my farm, my dad's farm, we would raise this crop.  This is called alfalfa. It's the hay that we would sell it to these dairies in California, to these milk cows.  And the plant itself, you would grow it and grow it and grow it and grow it.  And then when it was ready, it started to turn purple. This little purple bud would come off on the leaf.  And as soon as it became purple, every day that passed, it became less and less valuable.  It started to get rank. It started to become not as it's like it reached a certain point where it was max.  And then you wanted to wait to get as close as possible to that point where it started to turn purple.  And then every day after that, you're losing money because the quality of the hay is not going to test as well.  It's not going to be as good. It's not going to sell for as much per ton, et cetera.  I view it the same way. We're raising, it's like a crop, right?  We're sending the leads. We're calling. We're kind of like nourishing them all the way up.  And then there's a point when it's time to freaking cut the hay. It's time to go and make the hay.  It's time to go. It's time to get the deal. And every second you wait, you're losing opportunity.  This happened to me when I started this program three years ago, literally three years ago.  I was looking, if you guys saw my post earlier, go comment on it if you don't mind.  I did my first live video in this group, November 30th, 2021, three years ago, three years ago.  It was not the best time of year. It was a time where if you were to look at the entire year, it was not necessarily the best time of year.  You could have chose the spring where it's easier to get leads. You could have chose whatever.  It's not holidays. When it's holidays, people aren't thinking about buying programs, whatever.  According to all the experts, it was the wrong time of year.  But I realized that I had raised this crop. I had raised this Facebook group.  And there was an opportunity to go and harvest at that very moment.  And if I waited every day that I waited, it was going to become less and less.  And that's when I made the decision. I'm just going to go for it. I'm just going to go.  It's the exact same thing with each one of these deals. And it's interesting because each one is different.  I've sent one lead that they didn't even get the deal.  They maybe ran one lead and I've gone for the close because they start asking buying questions and they just felt right.  And I closed it. I've also sent five leads. They've closed two of them.  And I've lost the deal because I think I waited too long or I skipped a step, whatever.  But what I want to just remind everyone on this call is that there is a time to go for the kill.  And when it comes, you need to move",

The one I took the screenshot, go to the files, go or go to the media, go to video, scroll to the very bottom.  Go and find the live. The very first live ever did is back on November 30th, 2021.  OK, and I forgot about this. Guys, when I ran this live, you can you can see that it was last second.  It was it was like I was trying every reason to run this, to start this group.  I was trying to push it off. But I couldn't. I just knew I had to do it.  And you listen on this live. I forgot about this, but I actually was supposed to go to Disneyland with my family, my my kids and my wife and everything.  And I ran the call. I told my wife, I said, I'm going to run the call.  This is the day before Thanksgiving. I announced it. I said, I'm going to run it on Monday.  I'm going to have to meet you down there. I know you guys are leaving on Sunday or you're leaving on Monday morning, but this has to happen now.  And I'm sorry. And I will. I booked the flight and everything.  I said, as soon as I get done, I am going to rush to the airport. I'm going to meet you in Disneyland.  OK, that was the plan. And I got on the call. I ran the call and there was a bunch of questions and I did not.  I didn't close it fast enough. I completely like was I was so into the call, answer the questions and pump.  And I got done and I jumped. I had my bag probably knowing me. I didn't even have it ready.  Got my bag out of the car, started zipping down to Vegas and realized I missed the flight.  And so I ended up stopping, getting sushi, sitting by myself at a sushi place, a sushi bar and just enjoying got a hotel, did some work and came back.  OK, so again, guys, there's a time to go for the kill and there's a time when it passes.  And when you feel it, it's time to strike. They say it's time to strike, strike when the iron's hot.  OK, and some of you guys are sitting on deals right now and you're like, well, I should just say and one of my brothers, Zach, if he's on here, if he watches this, he's like the king of procrastinating the best time.  And I get it, dude, because you want to wait for that perfect time and that perfect time.  It's like, well, let me get him one more lead. And sometimes we genuinely think that and sometimes we're just procrastinating because we're scared.  But sometimes that one lead that you're waiting for, that one extra lead, you're going to lose the deal.  We've done this before. We've done this as a team, my team.  We've done this with people that are supposed to join this program.  And it's like, well, such and such thing.  And they're not going to be by their computer.  And it's like we push it off and push it off.  Then all of a sudden something happens like, yeah, I just got hit with the tax bill or something happened to my dad and I got to go be with him in another country.  And it's like, dude, we should just run the deal.  We should just run the call. Right.  Anyway, this kind of ties into my whole philosophy of send it when you",

And even if it doesn't make total sense, just realize it's all going to work out because you're going to win more than you're going to lose if you just go for it when you feel like the time is right.  So, guys, I'm so pumped about this group.  I'm stoked.  I'm really, really stoked.  I hate even talking too much about 3.0 because then everyone's like, when is it going to come out?  I don't know the date because I want to make it so good that it doesn't even it's unrecognizable.  So I'm not even going to give you guys an estimate, but I'm going to try to get this thing done before the end of Q1.  I know that's like seems a bit far out, but I just want you guys to know we are completely redoing the way that we're doing everything.  Now, for those of you like, I'm going to wait.  No, start now, dude.  I from this right here, we have Ryan Dalton's made eighty seven thousand dollars a month.  You can go make thousands, tens of thousands.  You can become a millionaire with what we have right now.  But I want to make it that much better.  I want to make it so unrecognizable that doesn't compare to anything in the marketplace.  And it's it's it's going to be so much different.  Right.  Not right. You guys have no idea, but I am super, super stoked about that.  And also, I said this in my I think it was in my post two days ago that I realize when I first started this group, I was I was going live.  I was dropping nuggets.  I was doing all this stuff and I've kind of gotten away from that a little bit just because of scale and bandwidth.  But I'm going to make it a point, even if it cuts into my other stuff, that I am very, very active in this group.  You guys see me a lot.  I don't know if it's going to be every day, but it's going to be multiple times a week, whether it's a post, whether it's alive, whether it's a little replay.  But I'm super, super, super excited.  Not about the new people that are going to join this, but about you guys, about those of you that have put your trust in me, that have that have committed to being here.  And I'm going to take you guys to the freaking promised land.  OK, so I appreciate you guys being on here.  And Stephanie Prather says continued time is our enemy.  That is very, very true.  That said, guys, go enjoy your weekend for those of us that are going to be doing a little hustle, hustle, get up early.  The best thing, let me end with this, the freaking best way to start a weekend.  It's not by getting in an ice bath or whatever.  That's great.  That's cool.  However, the best way to start your weekend is schedule a sales call at six thirty a.m., seven a.m.  on Saturday morning and go and bang a deal in a stripe and have the most phenomenal two days of your freaking life.  You want to talk about dopamine.  You know, you know, when they talk about Richard or Andrew Huberman talks about you get an ice bath to get a dopamine dope.  That's cool. Cool.  No pun intended.  You want to know what the ultimate dopamine hit is?  Go get a deal at six thirty a.m.  on a Saturday morning before you go to the gym, before you eat breakfast, before you even see your kids and",

Yeah, I know you guys went over this in like the last few zooms, I think, I don't know if there's,  it's with the ranges in the ads and the keyword list, I'm still getting ranges, so, I'm in the  US, but I've made an MCC account, and I linked my sub account to it, and on that sub account,  I've ran an ad in the past, and I've spent something like $200 on it, so, yeah, I'm just  wondering how to get that, to not show ranges anymore. Okay, is the ad active right now?  It was active in November, I paused it sometime in December, but I resumed it maybe last week,  a week or two ago. Okay, and when you're under, when you're on Keyword Planner, are you under  that account, under that ad account? Yes. Okay, and it's still not showing the ranges for you,  huh? Yeah, like it is showing the ranges, but like not specifically, you know. Okay, would you like  would you be able to share your screen so I can take a look? Yeah, I believe so. I'm kind of getting  the impression that so many more of you guys are having, what group did you come, did you come from  Shib's group, or did you find this group? Yeah, I did. Okay, it seems like everyone from Shib's  group is having this issue, so it's very odd, so I'm trying to figure it out as well, but I think  I'm trying to figure it out as well, but I think some of it is,  so",

I don't think  they're, I don't think it's just a glitch as well, so there's some stuff happening. My point is like  there's stuff happening on the Google ad interface right now, and we're not like fully aware of what  they're trying to do yet. We're all trying to like, what are you guys doing? So, I don't know. So,  okay, yeah, let's try to go to, let's open up Keyword Planner. Let's see what happens here.  Okay. Yeah, so this is my sub account I have here. Click it.  Concrete.  Okay.  Yeah, this is what I've still been getting.  Okay. All right, and this is, did I make seen this right? Ann Arbor,  Michigan for the term concrete. All right. Let me, give me, give me a second. Let me,  let me pull up mine and let me see. Let me see what I'm getting. Again, I think this is,  I don't know if this is like a glitch in the system. I don't know if it's Google trying to  like mess with, you know how like they have like the $1,000 spending limit now, and I don't know  if they're doing it. I just, I don't know what they're doing lately. There's definitely some  interface and platform stuff going on. All right, let me, I'm going to click one here.  Click one here.  Because I think when I had the ad ring in November, I could view it.  Yeah. Well, I'm going to see right now. If I'm getting Ann Arbor, Michigan, right?  About 538,000 people. Okay. Concrete. Get results. Let's see what I got here.  Getting, not even a spreadsheet showing up. Hang on. Let me hit refresh.  That was really weird. It like loaded, but it didn't load all the way. So let me try to redo it.  Give me a second.  Hmm. Okay. So I'm getting a really weird, can you scroll up on the spreadsheet on your end there?  Or is that the top? That's the top. Okay. Give me a quick second. Let me see what I got going on here.  There's mine.  There it goes.  Yeah, mine's showing, don't leave your platform. And let me, I'm just trying to go back and forth  between my window and yours. So mine's showing the term concrete at 110.  It has no, it just tracks search volume, but there's no CPC data for it.  Even concrete contractors, concrete companies. There's concrete repair. That's the only one that  I have a CPC for. So let's look at this again. That's the same for mine.  That dollar amount. Yeah. But I'm seeing like that's a 20 for me.  Okay.  Okay. Go ahead and scroll up on the spreadsheet.  I'm not sure why you're not seeing the same thing. Okay. So I'm running this on  a really, really old smart campaign that Nick used to have that we're not running ads on.  It's still a active campaign, but it's like, there's nothing running on it at all. So it's  like, there's no, it's an active campaign, but the ads are paused. Does that make sense?  So it has the same green like circle you do.

And I'm using  one in a whole different state, like system old smart campaign.  So, I mean, there's nothing, that's nothing special about it.  Um, was, was that a campaign that's like already been ran before maybe  this one was, but he, I don't think this campaign has been active for like three years.  Oh yeah. It's still, I mean, there's, it's an active, it's still left,  but there's no active ads running. Yeah. Yeah. I'm not sure if it was something like  it's grandfathered in compared to this is like a brand new one or what I just set up like  four ads for different clients. Um, this last week, brand new ads, no problem using this.  So I'm not sure why, why you guys are having this issue. It's something I haven't figured out why  yet, but it's something with, um, the people from it's like something in their setup. I can't figure  out what it is yet that you guys are getting from, um, in ships group, like how you guys are setting  it up. Um, I'm not sure why yet. Um, again, it could just, it could just be like all of my accounts,  like I've spent well over a thousand dollars, like, um, you know, Nick's like one and a half million.  Uh, I'm, you know, I'm in the several hundred thousand dollar range. Like,  so I don't know if it's just that it could be that and it's like a new platform thing. Um,  have you used, um, Ryan's, uh, let me see if I can get to it. Uh, rare rare. Yeah. Have you used that  yet? I haven't yet. Okay. Yeah. I highly recommend it. Um, so I'm still like in the beginning of  using it, but like, watch, I'm just going to do States. We're going to do  Michigan. We're going to do a few of the videos, uh, yeah. Is that promoting it?  Yeah. It's pretty cool. Um, like it's got a lot of the niches built in.  Okay. Let's see here. Um, keyword planner and then we're going to do, I totally clicked the wrong  one here. Sorry. So let's see what it shows. So this is like, this is kind of where,  like, my brain is at right now with this for you guys. Um, let me, let me share my screen again.  Okay. So, okay. So I just went in, I just did concrete, Michigan, Ann Arbor, right? And it's  like, here's your, that's a good one. Um, and then we're going to, we're going to, we're going to  Okay. So, okay. So I just went in, I just did concrete, Michigan, Ann Arbor,  right? And it's like, here's your, that's exactly what I saw on keyword planner.  Um, it doesn't give a CPC, but you see this, how there's like, this is your, are you familiar with  like keyword difficulty, a KD rating? Um, not a whole lot. Okay. It's just, it's just a,  some of the platforms use it as a metric to try",

It's basically, they're just doing a quick, like it's, it's right here.  It's low, medium, or like really high competition, right? So this tells me that there might be some  ads running, but it may not be enough for it to like really pick up the other data that you're  wanting to find. Okay. Um, but then like, you can see, you know, it kind of, I just did one word  and it populates a lot of these other ones, right? So it's like concrete companies, concrete  contracts. So there's search volume here. Um, you know, I only see like, remember we saw the  concrete repair was the only one that we saw that for. Um, so it's definitely something to  see what this is. It's, it's, uh, look at this. Um, yeah, you can see like in the warmer months,  there's more searches than the colder months. Um, and that might be why it's not picking up CPC  right now. That could be why, because it is cold up there. Um, so my, my thing right now for you  guys is like this, this tool allows you to do like track tasks. You could do due diligence on it.  Um, you can, you know, put things in, you can keep track of things in your clients, like leads,  phone numbers, like it's a pretty bitching tool. Um, I haven't messed with the backlink analyzer  yet because that's still new, but, um, I think this is like the path forward for you guys.  Honestly, it just, it just, it seems to simplify things. It's less spreadsheets. It's less manual  stuff. It kind of is like a one-stop shop for what we want to do. And it allows you to go really  fast and at scale. So, um, I'm still trying to figure out how to get my VA on it. Um,  and, and maybe get her off of like using main goals and SIM rush and all that stuff. So I  may have her go full time on rare just to see if it's faster for her to do so.  And when it doesn't get like CPCs that pick up on that, is that like a  keyword you should not be like targeting as well?  Uh, so yes and no. Like if you're looking at Michigan, like you saw in one of those,  like it dropped off to like 10 in the cold months and you can see it pick back up in the warmer  months. So that, that doesn't mean that there's no ads running. It just probably means there's  not a lot of ads running right now. Sometimes when like search volumes really low, it doesn't,  it just doesn't aggregate the data up. It doesn't mean that you shouldn't run an ad on it.  Or if you go like to a warmer city and try to maybe use that term, you might get better results  right now. Like if you go somewhere in Florida right now, um, you may see more, like even a  like-sized city. I mean, that's a, that was like what 538,000 people. Um, that's one of those,  like if you go back way back in the group, you'll see people like I did my research and CPC was this  and three months later it's like this. And it's like, well, yeah, it's warmer. There's more people  on the auction market. Like, so, you know, there's,",

    "pageContent": "there's, there are fluctuations in the data.  There's fluctuations in the marketplace, right? But, uh, like right now searching in a cold place  for concrete may not give you the best results because sometimes that data that Google is  giving to you is like within a couple of like, it might only be two or three months of data  and may not be like forever data. Right. So, and you'll see that like, you'll see that in like,  let's say you're, you're running ads at say, like, say you start and it's like 650 click.  And then in the warmer months, it's like double that. And then you'll notice again, in the colder  months, it goes back down. So if you stay in certain niches in certain areas, you'll see kind  of cycles, but it's just the thing where, you know, it's why we, you know, we, that's why we  want to look at our ads and make adjustments and we go through them and we look at things and,  oh, what is, what is my, what is it telling me this bit is versus what is my set limit at? And  sometimes you have to fluctuate with that, uh, depending on the weather, really.  So that makes sense. I appreciate your help.  Yeah, no problem. But yeah, I think I'm not sure why you guys, it's, it seems like, I don't know  if we're getting all of our new students from shifts group, but all of you guys are having the  same problems. I'm not sure if it's like, maybe you set up Google ads or your Google keyword planner  a certain way, and it's not recognizing that ad, but I've had other students where we did that  and it worked fine for them. So it's just not working out for everybody. But I'm also,  I'm not like a hundred percent there, but like I mentioned, I'm seeing stuff on the interface  that is like not showing data the way it normally would. And it's like, you have to like go and like  manually open columns. And so there's something going on with the Google ads platform is what  I'm getting at. So I don't know if they're like silently doing an update. I don't know if they're  doing some backend stuff. And so our user end is not looking correct right now. I don't know if  this is going to be a permanent thing, if it's a temporary thing yet, but I'm kind of, I'm kind of  going towards, because right, like Google, like, okay, Google is the largest advertising agency,  like in the world. Okay. So they want to make money. They've been losing money for years. So  they're doing things to try to make more money, but their biggest, the biggest thing they kind  of like guard against is fraud. Right. And so, so like one of the, like one of the barriers to entry  now is like, you have to spend a thousand dollars in ad spend to be able to like quote unquote,  like run an MCC or be able to set up sub accounts in your MCC. That's something that's about a year  old now. It was like, now, like now everybody faces that, or for like the first five or six  months of that, it was hit and miss. Now it's like, that's just, that's, that's how it is for  everybody on the platform. So my point is like, they change things sometimes, and sometimes  they'll do certain things for certain features to make the barrier enter it harder or higher.  And part of that is like, because if, if I have you run ads for a range,",

So that there could be something like  that happening on the Google ad platform. I'm not sure yet, but I'm thinking that this,  we may be seeing that. So we'll have to change how we like kind of do our setup. And so thankfully  for us right now, rare is available and it's working really well. And I've ran, I've ran dozens  of like, look at rare data and look at keyword planner data. And it is almost always spot on.  Sometimes one of the search terms is like 10 or 20 off, but that's more just because like  the API that he's using to pull that data in is probably a month older than what like actual  keyword planner data is. So you might have a month where like search volume increases,  but it like, it hasn't caught up to the API feed that he gets his data from.  So that, but that gets a small discrepancy. And when I've seen it, I can look at it and go,  oh, I know why I can see it. I can see the data difference. And then if I, I'm sure if I go back  and check it, his will get updated the next month. So I think it's just like a little  month delay reporting, but it's, it's been super accurate as far as like for our needs,  as far as that. So I think that that's like the place to, to start doing this stuff out for you  guys. Pretty spot on. Yeah. Yeah. It's been great. I mean, I'm, like I said, I'm, I'm, I'm trying to,  I'm trying to like build a process and then, and build like a kind of like a training video and  like a, like a, like a step-by-step thing. Cause my VA knows main goals really well.  And she, she knows keyword planner. She knows how to like double check with keyword planner when she  has a maybe. But, you know, using how I, how I've been doing due to her, I've had her doing  due diligence using that and rare has been giving me the same info and it's all in one place. So we  don't have to like have multiple tabs, multiple sheets. It takes away a lot of like a lot of time.  Like that's why I have a VA doing it for me now, because it's worth it for me to have them do it.  So I'm not bogged down for hours doing due diligence, but with rare, like if I was just,  you know, by myself, I would rather use that tool because it does all of the stuff for me in one  place. Whereas, you know, how I have it done now, it's like, it's multiple steps on different  software and then we put it into place. So anyways, I'm trying to kind of streamline my  thing so I can now train her how to use it. So that it kind of makes me, it makes sense to her,  but I'd probably get that done like later this weekend or something. So.  Yeah, that makes sense. I wonder why the ads accounts like that, because I had a Google  Keyword Planner through Shiv's group and then it got it suspended. So I made a new,  I used a new Gmail for this one",

I wish I could  tell you it was something easy, but like I said, Ryan's thing has done pretty awesome.  And I think that's where you guys should like probably go to.  Okay. Well, I appreciate your help, Jay.  Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. I couldn't solve it anymore, but like I said, I think that's the  issue there. So. Yeah, no problem. I think so.  All right, man. Cool. All right. Take care, man.  Yeah. I'll see you. All right. See you.  All right. Okay. It's just me again. I think we have a few people watching.  Anyone wants to hop in? The Zoom link is there.  For some reason, the chat on my desktop is not caught up on the Facebook. So give me a second.  Okay. I'm going to see if I can like send this to see if this helps like pop it through.  Oh, I see why it's doing it.  Okay. All right.  Let's see if I can go here.  Okay. All right. I am seeing it on my other window. So, okay. We'll just kind of go with that.  So if you guys have any other questions, let me know if you guys want. We have the Zoom open.  I'll kind of leave the Zoom open. And if you guys don't have any questions,  I will start running through some of the DMs I got this week and we can go from there.  Okay. And just like a thing for everyone that's new and listening or seeing the replay of this,  I try to be very, I try to check into the Fix It paid ads account at least twice a day.  I'm pretty consistent with that, just so you know. But like if you guys leave me a DM  and I don't respond and say like, try to give me 36 hours-ish, if you don't hear back from me,  don't be afraid to like just get on the DM and say, hey man, just wanted to see if you got this yet.  So, and I just say that because like sometimes, like say I've got my full-time job and  things are getting busy. Like I may see your question and I recognize your question and I'm  like, well, that's going to take like, you know, that's going to take like, I need to spend some  time. That's not a quick answer. Basically, it's not something, oh, do this or do that. It might  be something where I have to kind of like go sit, think about it, or maybe pull up some info for you  to share with you or try to go find something in the group or something to share with you.  So sometimes like that may happen and it's just, I get distracted or busy. It's not that I'm  forgetful. I just got busy and forgot to get back to you. So just don't be afraid to send back. But  I'm pretty good about trying to get right back to you guys when I can. But I just want you guys to  know that. And at the same time, if you leave me something and I reply back to you, like,  and you don't reply back for like two weeks, don't, when you come back in two weeks looking  for something, don't expect me to jump on and get things going.

There's like, you know, there's captcha that you  can do for like to try to reduce like the form span. There's, you know, you can do like the IVR  with like press one or press two to talk to somebody. And that helps like reduce some spam,  but like the sophistication of spam is like, they're always like steps ahead of like the  defense mechanism. So just, just understand that like we all deal with that. And so just,  just kind of take that for what it is.

And then, you know, I don't know  how many times we've got to repeat this, like, stay out of large cities. Like, just don't do it.  Please don't do it. Once you get like experience and you are very confident and you're making money,  you know, then there's ways to like eke into it and niche down and, you know, get better with  your locations and ad groups. And you have to set up multiple location pages and service pages.  Like there's ways to do it, but like, don't jump into it. Don't like, like don't jump into Houston.  You know, like don't, that's, that's not, you're just going to, until you have the experience to  do it, like, you're just going to piss away thousands of dollars. And if you think you're  going to hop into a big Metro market for $5 a day or $5 a click at $20 a day, like you're not going  to make any money. You're not going to have any business owners that are going to be happy with  you. So just take our advice and don't do that, right? Small, smaller cities, like keep it  manageable. Well, once you get experience and you understand this stuff and you can read the data,  that's when you can maybe start doing those bigger city areas. Okay. Some of you guys,  really just a couple of you, like, it seems like every, every couple of weeks I get a message and  you're trying to find a place and it's a constant like, well, don't, don't do that.

You get this recommendation  from Google is like conversion tracking. Um, on your Weebly one-pagers, to me, there's really no  reason to do it at all.

Um, at the end of the day though, like, um,  like, like my client's phones are ringing and they're getting forms or they're not like, I don't  really care about the conversion stuff unless I'm into some very competitive markets or like high  population areas. I don't really care. I just want the phone ring and I want forms to come in.

    "pageContent": " Website, running it out, lead generation.  Oh, there we go.  Recording started lead generation, building a website and ranking it is the  exact same skillset as having an SEO client who you build a website for and  do the SEO you don't own the website.  The client does, but in my mind, I wanted to make, you know, I wanted to make  lead gen work, but then I saw opportunities coming my way for easy wins.  And, you know, business owners, I knew connections I had, Hey, can you do my  website for me now that they knew I had that skillset and I was like, man, I  would way rather work for you than work for my job, right?  So I'm like, okay, I can do that.  And we structure a deal.  Okay.  500 bucks a month.  I'll build you a new website and I won't charge you for the new website  build, even though it's a website development.  Like I can do it so well with employees worldwide, so cheap.  I can build a website for $40 is my cost.  I'll do that for free and you just pay me 500 bucks a month and you'll get the  website, you'll get the SEO work, you'll get everything.  And now I have these cash reserves.  And so once that clicked for me, I was like, wow, I just need to take those  easy wins and yeah, lead gen is awesome.  Keep building that, keep building those sites, keep ranking those things.  But I want to get out of my job ASAP.  And that's what clicked for me.  And I was like, okay, if I can do it once, you know, I bought this program,  um, your program and another program to learn.  And it took me like four months and I was grinding, grinding, making no money  until that first deal kind of came my way.  And I was like, okay, I have the skillset.  I'm going to do it.  And I took that first one.  And then I was like, wow, if I can just once the sites built and they're on,  it's just like mailbox money, 500 bucks a month, 500 bucks a month.  Um, and my team would just handle it.  And it was easy.  So I was like, man, if I can just stack those and get a hundred of those, get  150, get 200, that'll be life changing.  And that's exactly what happened.  So that's been the big breakthrough.  Like I think the main concept is like going from zero to one.  That's where people that are at jobs struggle with is getting the first client.  And so in my mind, I want to make getting the first client as easy as possible,  because once you have that first client, then the flood gets open because now the  pressure is on to deliver, to learn.  You'll learn way faster, get two, three, four, five, and your business will grow.  But you just got to go from zero to one.  So many people get stuck at that zero stage.  If you can get one, then you're rolling.  You're going.  So,  so the, the, the thing that is that Zach's kind of alluding to is that.  He was smart and he started targeting people.  And we're going to get into that a little bit, but he started targeting people who  already were paying for SEO services.  He wasn't going in.  My problem was I was trying to sell everyone SEO.  I was trying to sell the water bottle company, the restaurant, you know,  cause",

    "pageContent": "everyone technically could benefit from SEO, right?  Every single company, the Kleenex brand, everyone can benefit from SEO.  And I was trying to go and sell people on SEO and on why they should use me.  And Zach realized there's a subset of the market out there that are already paying  300, 500, $700 a month, and all he's got to do is switch them over to his service.  Give them a much pre, a much more premium service for the same price, or  even a little bit less, and dude, these people are set it and forget it.  These people are going to be paying this bill forever.  So, uh, Zach, how does somebody go from the zero to one?  Like, let's just use an example, um, Killpot 5000.  I'm not sure what your real name is, but let's just say Killpot's sitting in a  nine to five job and is tired of freaking trading their time for dollars,  waking up, punching the clock, barely making it work, not able to go to the  gym because they're tired, coming back depressed, no money, no, nothing's  exciting about their situation and they want to go and they want to make that  first deal.  How does somebody go from zero to one if they want to start today?  Awesome question.  When I started, I thought, what is the lowest hanging fruit?  What is the easiest sale?  And it's through your network.  So any business owner that you know, you just, you don't want to go in pitching,  but you want to just go and ask him questions.  You want to learn, you want to ask him questions.  Hey, how's your business doing?  How are you guys doing online?  How do you like your website?  How are you guys ranking?  What would you like to do better online?  And you just start the discussion and they'll just be honest with you  because they trust you.  So you have your network, but then a step further is anybody, you know,  that knows a business owner.  So then once I talked to someone, I'd be like, awesome.  Yeah.  Do you know any other business owners I could talk to that might be  wanting to grow their business?  And of course, tons and tons of business owners want to grow their business.  So if you just work your network, you can usually get anywhere from  three to 10 deals right there.  And those initial deals are really important because it'll build your  confidence and you can go from there.  Once you've kind of worked your immediate network, their network, then  it's like just people around you in your, in your city, in your neighborhood,  business owners that where it's easy, like, Hey, yeah, I live right down the street.  You know, I'm in, I live in queen Creek, Arizona.  I'm like, yeah, I'm right here in queen Creek.  Um, I'd love to just, you know, kind of talk to you about your  business a little bit, like, how are you guys doing?  And since you have a tie to them, you have a connection.  It's an easy conversation starter.  Um, especially when you're new, people get nervous, but essentially if you're  able to get someone to open up and you ask these questions I'm talking about,  they open up and then you just say, Oh, cool.  You want to do this thing.  I actually have the skills to do that thing.  How much are you currently paying for your current thing that you're getting  now for your website, for your SEO?  Oh, 300 bucks",

    "pageContent": "a month.  Awesome.  I'll do it for that same price and I'll give you way better service.  And I'm here local and you know, list goes on and on and I'm a small business  instead of that big company that you're with.  So those are some initial thoughts for dual from zero to one network, their  network, people in your neighborhood, and then just calling businesses.  Like you got to put in the reps.  So if you have zero clients and you're trying to get the first one, talk with  five business owners every day.  And that consistency will get you one client, two clients, you'll get better  at it, three clients, four clients, and it'll start building and that momentum  will just carry you forward.  So that's kind of what I'd say to go from zero to one.  So that's what I did.  Did you just make a list of all like being pretty practical here on steps?  Did you just sit there and go, okay, here's all the people that I know that  are owned businesses and then let me send them a message.  Let me call them.  Like, what was that?  What would that look like?  Was it just like, here's every single person that owns a business in  general or these types of businesses?  Or how did you, did you just compile a list?  Great question.  I literally pulled up a Google sheet with my free Gmail, pulled up a Google  sheet and I wanted business owners that were like service businesses, which I  don't really know many other business owners that aren't like providing a  service, maybe there's like an e-commerce business, I wouldn't focus on that.  Maybe there's manufacturing, wouldn't do that.  But most business owners that, you know, in your neighborhood are going to be  small business owners and that those are great people to talk to.  So I just pulled up a Google sheet and I just started writing names,  just brainstorming.  Once I ran out of names, I pulled up my phone and I just started slowly going  through the hundreds of contacts in my phone and adding somebody, adding  somebody, adding somebody.  And that was my simple first, like CRM to track what was going on with everybody.  Right.  So the first column was everybody's name.  And then I went through my Facebook friends and I went through the  whatever and got my list and maybe I have 20 to 30 people and I'm, it  doesn't sound like many, but you start talking to them and you start realizing  there's all these needs, all these unmet needs and people are generally  unsatisfied with who they've worked with.  Generally big marketing companies don't do a good job and don't care enough  about each individual client.  And so people are usually upset when they see a client that they don't  usually upset, which makes an easy, easy sale to slide in and help them out.  Or people don't understand things.  So if you just have the knowledge and just teach people, um, they will kind  of come to you as the expert, Hey, yeah, even if you don't work with me, I  would recommend doing this, this, and this, um, you can do it on your own.  I can help you do it and you can pay me to do it for you.  Like, and that's the conversation that's get started.  So I think like simple scales, the more simple you can make it, especially in  the beginning, the more you're going to scale if you overcomplicate it and you  start worrying about like, Oh shoot, how am I going to do, um, blog posts and  back linking and all this",

    "pageContent": "complicated stuff is like, who cares?  You don't have a client.  Just make a very simple list.  Start talking to those people.  If you don't know the answers, pull up chat GPT and type in, Hey, what do I do  here?  And you can tell the person, Hey, yeah, that's a great question.  I've actually haven't come across.  So before, let me look it up real quick, figure it out.  And you're like, okay.  And live while you're talking to them, you're solving their problems and  showing that you want to work with them.  So I think just keep it really simple, build the list, use free works  resources like Google sheets.  And now, you know, you have the names, then you have your notes in the next  column, this date, talk to them, make sure to call them again on Friday.  Right.  It's so basic, but that's why it's effective because you actually use it.  So that's how I got started.  Did you find that a lot of the people that you were reaching out to on your  list were already paying for a similar type of service?  They were paying somebody to host their website or were you basically, you  know, having to, to get them to pay you something they weren't already paying?  Awesome question.  Um, almost everyone was paying for their website and is it's pretty rare for a  business owner and an electrician, a plumber, a carpet cleaner to build their  own website, it just takes too much time.  Like they don't, they're focused on making money, doing plumbing, doing  carpet, me doing whatever their thing is.  And they don't think about it.  When I, I, it always comes back to me to, in college, when I did sales, I  sold door to door selling direct TV.  And it was so hard.  It was a gnarly experience.  Like I was in Houston in the summer.  It's like 105 degrees and humid.  I'm just sweating like crazy.  But in a hundred days, it was like a three month summer.  I made $70,000 as a college kid.  And I don't watch TV.  Like I don't care about TV.  It's it's I've never really cared about TV.  And so you're like, man, how, how was that even possible?  I didn't believe in the TV.  What I believed in was saving people money.  And I could save people money by switching them from dish network or  AT&T, you verse to direct TV.  And that switch was so easy.  If they were paying $150 a month, I could get them all the same channels  plus NFL Sunday ticket for $70 a month.  So less than half the price.  And they get every single football game the next fall and they get all the  channels, right?  So that switch was so easy.  And that summer in a hundred days, I did 300 switches and made $70,000.  So when I was learning Legion and learning websites and learning SEO, it  kind of clicked all of a sudden.  And I was like, Whoa, how could I get people that are already paying for  this to just switch to me and I can give them more channels and NFL Sunday  ticket, right?  I was like, okay, I'm just going to find the people that are paying 300, 500,  700 bucks a month, a thousand, whatever they're paying and match their  bit and over deliver on the services.  So, okay, you're paying $500 a month for your website and SEO.",

So,  so for those that just jumped on, for those that aren't following, basically  the strategy from a high level is using SEO, which is taking people's websites,  ranking them on Google, you are going to go to your contact list, the people  that you know, your warm network, especially, and specifically the home  service businesses, you're going to go in with a wit, like it, with the mindset  of I'm going to add value, I'm going to help, I'm going to see how I can add  value and sure, if they want to pay me great, if not, I'm still going to be  that person that's like adding value.  You go in most likely, you're going to be able to offer them the exact same  thing, plus one or two additional things, more value for the same price or less.  And doing that strategy, you're going to be able to stack your first one, two,  three, four, five, 10 clients.  That's from a, from like, uh, that's a very simple, simplified way to say it,  but that's essentially what strategy is.  Right.  Yeah.  And then you just, um, always are improving that.  So once you have a couple of clients and you're like, Whoa, these switches are  easy, you start hearing more names of like, Oh, wow, this big marketing  company does a terrible job.  These people do a bad job.  This software is expensive and I can, you know, pull clients or cross sell.  You know, they could have that software and use me for their site.  Um, and you start, you know, getting lists and like attacking easy went.  And that's how I just really start snowballing is you're like, wow, I can  just hone in on exactly who I want to target for some people it's, it's  niches like, Ooh, I'm, I'm really good with carpet cleaners because my dad owns  a carpet cleaning company, I'm going to focus on carpet cleaners.  I can speak their language or other people, you know, find a company.  This big marketing company is terrible.  No one likes them.  They have terrible reviews.  I'm just going to pull people over.  Um, and so figuring out those strategies has been huge.  Yeah.  So the, the initial few clients is just hitting your network.  And then from there, you've got to have a bigger strategy.  That's something that you can, you could turn into a system.  And that's what Zach, the reason that Zach's been able to get to $56,000 per  month is not because he's",

    "pageContent": "got a network with that many people, but his initial  clients in that, I think you're right, dude, it's the same thing with digital  real estate, right?  Going from zero to one gives you all the confidence in the world to, Oh my  gosh, this is actually going to work.  And then the second deal becomes easier.  And the third deal and the fourth deal and the fifth deal.  And so guys, the reason why.  I didn't do SEO correctly is first and foremost, I was targeting big juicy  retainers because that's what I like to do with digital real estate.  I like to get thousand 1500.  I had a client, an SEO client.  It was paying me $4,000 per month.  And honestly, that was the same client that caused me to stop doing SEO.  Because while I was on vacation, that same individual called me and canceled  and it like completely just ruined my vacation because it took like 40% of  my 40 or probably like 50% of my revenue at that point.  And what Zach does is he goes in strategically and goes to people that  are already comfortable paying a small micro bill and they have been, and  he's just switching them over.  Instead of selling someone on this new concept, he's taking people that are  already paying in general and just funneling that money into himself.  Yeah.  He does a little bit of work upfront.  And then after that, a lot of it set it and forget it.  The second thing that he did really well, it's genius.  And if you guys are like, man, this might distract me guys.  If you do what Zach's doing, which is targeting home service businesses, you  can literally go target your future digital real estate clients.  Like you could go in and say, Hey, I'm only going to target clients in tree  service or concrete or spray foam insulation, and I'm going to go get their  SEO, get in the door with their SEO at 500 bucks a month.  And guess what?  The only reason they want SEO is because they want leads.  So now I got their trust.  Now I'm going to take some of that money.  I'm going to go set up a strategy using what Nick talks about, put up a landing  page to put an ad up, run some ads, get them additional leads and say, Hey, Mr.  business owner, what do you think about buying these leads from my project as  well?  And now all of a sudden you have people that already trust you and it's the  easiest sell in the world to go for that second, third, fourth money.  So I wish I had done this.  I was an idiot.  I was literally taking, I had a.  A client that had a restaurant, a Mexican restaurant.  I had a client that did like wedding performances, like wedding bands, like  they would go and do like the, they like that type of a thing.  Great clients by the way, but they just, I was so spread out, dude.  And then I had like this foundation repair client that I had, uh, what else  did I even have at the time?  I had so many different things.  I didn't know how to speak the language and guys, all these people did not have  SEO, so I was a bill, right?  Zach's going in and he's like, look, you already have a bill.  Let me just, you just pay it to me instead.  I'm going to give you a way superior service.  And by the way, Zach, it's funny because I did door to door.  I sold home security systems, not direct TV,",

    "pageContent": "but I had the exact same strategy  is I realized really early on, dude, just go target the people that are already  paying the whoever sold them the security the first time they did the hard work.  They convinced them that they needed the bill.  Now I just got to show them that my product, my offering is a better  offering than theirs, simple, easy sale, no emotion, 20 minutes in and out.  Boom, boom, boom.  And I just made my commission.  So, um, the beautiful thing about SEO, the beautiful thing about lead gen is  that it's recurring, right?  You get paid again and again and again.  And Zach, I don't even think you've even gone and cashed in yet and went and  sold the, the lead gen on the backend.  But when you do, I think you're going to increase your revenue 10 to $20,000  overnight, because you probably are sitting on, uh, I don't know how many  clients and projects that you could go and sell, but I know you have such a  good system right now.  You're like, let me just keep, keep adding these on, but, um, let's talk  about your business really quick.  How many, how many clients is your $56,000 made up of?  Um, we have like 170 clients.  So your average clients between like, what, about three to 400 bucks?  Three, three to 400 bucks.  And a lot of them honestly, um, just stay forever.  So if you look at like the lifetime value of a client, it's like over  five, six, 7,000, because they just stay and pay that for so long.  And like the clients that we lose over time, some people like will retire or  like things like that or some, you know, it's like, it's like, Oh, are you  going to like give your company to your son?  One guy is actually, Hey, I'm retiring.  And he's like, Oh, actually I'm going to give my business to my son.  But now we still have him as a client.  And he was just like, goes and goes and goes.  And so over time, it's pretty crazy to see how like an easy sale and a system  where it's just like, my team just takes care of these people and does their stuff.  Very easy to set up that team.  And now I never think about it.  I never have a call.  They don't have my phone number.  They, they can email our support line or email my support team.  And I don't even know when we lose clients anymore or get them.  It's like, it's just so fractional small that we just keep adding them.  And then here and there, someone retires, whatever happens.  Right.  But there's not the stress.  There's the complete freedom of like the systems are going really well.  And now I just think about the big picture stuff.  How can I hire someone really cool to do this thing?  How can I think of a new strategy for sales?  And then my sales team does it.  So it's been very, very fun to grow it and then just plug people in that are  phenomenal at building websites, phenomenal at whatever they do and, and  just watch it compound over time since people are so sticky and stay so long.  It's really cool.  Yeah, that's dope, dude.  And you know what?  I used to hate the idea of having a ton of clients like that, but what I love  about having 150 clients is you have a business that's built brick by brick by  brick that",

    "pageContent": "you literally placed each one and it took a while to build, but it's  not going to crumble overnight, right?  You don't have one huge client that's like literally got you by the fricking  throat that's saying like, Hey, you better give me a better price or I'm going to  quit, dude, you could lose five clients tomorrow and you really wouldn't actually  feel it.  You know what I'm saying?  So that's, I like that strategy a lot.  The other reason I like it is because again, dude, when you decide to monetize  on the backend and you go and sell them lead generation, dude, if you can get 10%  of those people at a thousand dollars a month, you know, 15% of those people,  you're just increasing five, $10,000 per month right there.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  And the thing is like, I already know which people are perfect because there's  trust there and they come to us and say, Hey, we want more leads.  We want to run ads or do whatever.  It's like, that's an inbound lead to sell.  So you're perfectly positioned to do that.  For sure.  So tell everyone real quick, because dude, one thing that I realized when I started  doing this, you know, my, my dream was like, dude, I want to become a millionaire  by, you know, 30 years old.  I think that's such a cliche answer.  Everybody has, but that was me.  I've been writing that down in my little journal since I was 18.  And, and then when I hit it, it was like, okay, let's go bigger.  Let's go bigger.  And I've always like, I, then it's like, I want to be, I want to get  a million dollars a month.  Like that's, you know, the goal.  And I thought like, and I was always speaking to this and dude, it was literally  like a couple of weeks ago, I did a poll and I did it on here.  I did it in the Facebook group.  I did it to my digital landlords community.  And I just asked everyone like, what do you guys want?  And I put some options and it was like, uh, security, respect, um, whatever.  And then somebody, I didn't even put this and somebody added freedom.  And dude, everybody wanted that answer.  And so I started like thinking about it and I was like, you know what?  I think that like all that people want is they want to be able to make enough  money to be free from their freaking job and from what they're doing right now  and to go and do what they like to do.  And so Zach, I want you to tell everyone, like what, when you started, tell  everyone what, how your life was.  The job that you had, what your schedule was like.  And then I want you to tell everyone, like, and I know you're very humble, so  you would never say much, but like, tell everyone, like some of the cool stuff  you've done over the past in 2024, cause you're getting as bad as me, dude.  Every time I call you or text you, you're in some other country surfing  or something like that.  So, but yeah, tell it really, we're kind of going backwards, but tell everyone  your story as far as like where you were a couple of years ago, when you were  still in the J O B and then tell everyone like what this year's looked like for you.  Yeah, that is pretty interesting",

    "pageContent": "to think about that contrast and go back and  enter that space of like December, 2021.  Um, I still had a job.  It was a sales job and, um, our manager, new manager was like, okay, you got to  make a hundred cold calls a day because we don't have enough leads coming in.  When I was just used to like closing deals and I was like, Whoa, wait a  second, that's crazy.  And I had a conversation with my wife.  I was like, I really, really don't want to do this.  If I'm going to call a hundred people a day to sell this software that the  software company I was working for, if I'm going to do that, why don't I just  call a hundred people a day for my own company?  And I quickly was like, get me out of here.  Like I'm hustling so hard building someone else's dream.  It was a cool software, but I'm not, I don't truly care about it.  Right.  What I care about is helping small business owners like my dad that are  target cleaners and small businesses succeed.  So that was my mindset.  And I was like, I have to get out of here ASAP.  So, um, you know, it was like, it was like the handcuffs, like you had to, like,  there was like check-in meeting 8 AM, check out 5 PM.  Like it was remote.  I was in my house, but it was like, it was like handcuffs.  You had to like be on and your calls were being tracked.  And I was just like, Whoa, this is the new manager came in and it was  intense tons of calls to make every day.  And then like, you know, everyone in the company ranked and just,  just pretty intense stuff.  And I was like, it was just heavy.  And so then once I committed, I was like, my wife supported me and we're like,  okay, I'll just like grind and hustle and build my own thing.  What I did more and more over time is just essentially buying back my time.  You know, most people, when you're working for income, you're  trading your time for money.  Um, once I owned my own company, I was making more money.  I could trade my money for time.  I could employ people.  I could pay somebody and now they take care of all that work.  And I would buy myself back my time.  And so I just kept doing that month after month after month to now this year.  Um, I mean, last year, beginning of 2023, I was still closing deals.  Um, and then I was like, okay, I've hit a point.  I no longer need to close deals for my company.  And I hired a salesperson.  I hired a customer support, hired an SEO team, hired, um, SDRs like.  I hired everybody website builders and you know, it was, it was step by step.  And then the last couple of key hires were like a salesman  to completely take over sales and the sales team.  And now that I have a sales team in place, all the systems in place,  all the fulfillment in place, essentially, um, my day to day is.  I could honestly do whatever I want whenever I want.  I enjoy working and adding value.  So like I still work and I, I love training my team, helping them up skill.  I love hiring new people, um, going after new ideas and basically just  leading the team to crush it.  And that's what I'm all about.  Now is just",

Some buddies were going to Nicaragua on a surf trip and they were like, um,  they had their crew set, then someone dropped out and they're like, man,  who could go last second?  They called me and I'm like, yeah, I'm in.  So then I just can all of a sudden pick up and go to Nicaragua.  And it was epic.  Like we just were in Nicaragua on the beach would swim out with our surfboards  to a boat and the boat would drop drive up and down the coastline to the different  surf spots.  And we would just surf these different breaks that were incredible along the  cliffs in Nicaragua.  So that was, that was a fun trip.  We went to Hawaii for like over a month and got an Airbnb on the beach.  So our kids every day, we just wake up and walk out to the sand for a month.  Like that was pretty life changing.  Um, but I still feel like I was adding value because I was on the beach in  Hawaii or I was in the house and I was reading good books, you know,  and my kids is taking a nap.  I'm reading a good book.  And then I'm like, whoa, I'm just the idea guy now.  So I get this idea and boom, I just train, train the team, teach the team and  they, they take care of it.  So the super fun spot to be, um, when you say freedom, that's what everybody wants.  That's what I feel like this business model allows.  Yes, you need to grind.  You need to like hustle and get the first client, get that confidence, help those  stack, but there is a huge piece of mind knowing you have over a hundred clients,  plenty of money, plenty of savings, a team that's totally capable that you've  trained and now you can kind of do what you want with your day to day.  And one of the things that lights me up, like I have new goals now, like my  lifetime vision, my 25 year goal is to help thousands of business owners grow  their businesses and grow as people.  So that's what I'm all about is just helping other businesses grow,  helping other people grow.  And so I love studying self-improvement business growth.  And that's what I do now is just basically coach my team and then coach other  business owners on how to grow fast.  And it's so fulfilling.  I love it.  So that's kind of been a long answer to what this year's looked like for me,  but it's been an amazing year.  And when you were doing the job, you were making, I think I remember it was  like, what was it after taxes?  What was your take home?  I would take home each month 4,600.  I had like a 70,000 a year salary, but after taxes, you have 4,600 a month.  $4,600 a month, dude.  Um, can you imagine like now that you've experienced making $56,000 a month,  dude, I do not know, and this is all due respect, but like, I don't know how  people can live on less than like 15.  Like, obviously I do.  You cut the stupid stuff, but like when you're used to like not checking prices  at the grocery store or on the menu and stuff, like it's, it's, it's mind blog.  I don't know how at 4,600 bucks a month in 2024, how in",

So, um, it's crazy.  What I'm getting at is it's crazy that you're just at your six months away,  six months away at any time from like completely buying your freedom or  completely getting your freedom.  And dude, there is nothing better than like, I always say this.  It's like when your mom asks you to clean your room, it sucks.  It sucked when you're a kid, right?  My mom doesn't ask me to clean my room anymore.  Thank goodness.  I have, I, I, I do that myself or I pay somebody to do that.  But when you, as a kid would go and like, Hey, I'm going to surprise my mom  and just clean my room on my own, dude.  It was amazing, right?  You've got the, the energy.  It's just like work.  Like even though you and I don't have to work, I still wake up, dude, it's  seven AM in Dubai, like I should probably be on a boat, you know?  Uh, but I, I, I'm choosing to work and I don't have to work, but I enjoy it.  And I like to build and I like to see that.  But so when you're doing it because you want to, it's so much more fulfilling.  You have energy to do it.  So I know it's just like, when you're in a job and you have to go, dude,  it freaking sucks, it freaking sucks.  Um, like for example, uh, uh, Jersey shore devil, he actually just joined  our digital landlords program.  We were talking about this.  He's, he does furniture sales and he's like, he makes really good money, but  he has to travel to different locations and he has to go and he'd be, he said  he would be in like Columbia and he would have to come and do it.  And like, so we talked about this exact same thing.  So, um, anyway, dude, it's, uh, the, the exciting part is for anyone listening  right now, you are, I would say if you would put your head down, turn off the  distractions, quit, get in quick, like chase and all this different stuff,  pick one thing and do it for a solid six months, six months.  I think that anyone in this stream could become free.  Some people sooner, some people it's going to take them longer to learn.  But I think six months is not unrealistic to think that by June, by  mid summer of next year, not even by June, by May, by April, end of April,  by freaking April fool's day, you could, you could completely have a different  life or you don't have to answer to a boss.  And then like there's a clear path that we're giving you guys.  So anyway, um, dude, killer killer, uh, training today, bro.  Hopefully this inspires some people, hopefully gives us some ideas.  Again, guys, the business model of digital real estate is building  sites, ranking them on Google with SEO.  And then renting out the leads.  So what Zach's doing is he picked one part of the process.  He's just focusing on the SEO.  He got really good at it and he's getting, he's stacking clients,  he's stacking clients, he's stacking clients.  So, um, if you are somebody like in a job, you're like, let",

Um, let me see if I still have, actually, you know what I can do.  I'm going to put your website.  What is your website?  Zach Kyle.co Z A C K P O W E L L dot C O.  One thing I'll add on that thought too, is like, um, I had to kind of figure  this all out on my own and it was the slow way it was the grind.  Oh yeah.  Now people that I teach and coach up, it's just like, dude, here  is the exact way to do it.  And it's insane.  I even thought when I started helping people, Oh, this might take a year for them,  but people have done it in three or four months.  So the six months is like totally reasonable to go from zero to 10,000  months recurring revenue.  People have done it in four months.  Like six months, many multiple people have done it in six months.  It's totally possible.  Where, like you're saying by April, like the, they say focus is follow  one course until successful.  If you just focus and do this for six months, your life is completely different.  You go and you have, you now have that freedom to do what lights you up.  Do whatever you're passionate about.  Like it's amazing.  So I would just encourage you, if you're on the fence, like just go from zero to  one, you go from zero to one, that's the biggest sale of your life.  Go from zero to one, and then it'll just start snowballing and you'll look back  in April at today and be like, Whoa, Zach and Nick were telling me, and it's been  six months and I've earned my freedom.  It's like Braveheart, man.  Everyone wants freedom.  We don't actually realize like jobs aren't freedom.  When you're an entrepreneur at heart, like you want that freedom, just go out  and get it and commit.  And it's just that daily consistency that your daily standard right now, your  daily standards here, what you need to do is raise it and maybe your daily standard  now becomes talking with 10 business owners every day.  That's your new standard.  You have to abide by it in six months.  You've committed to that new standard.  You'll see the results of that higher standard you committed to.  So it's totally possible.  I just hope everyone will do it.  It's, it's amazing.  Yeah.  And, uh, I should add this, um, when I started digital landlords and, and, you  know, all my free, my free pro my, sorry, my free group and everything.  I'm I've been very, very cautious to not let people just come into my groups and  start like trying to sell stuff or, you know, check this out because everyone's  full of crap.  You know what I mean?  Like I see this happened inside of our free Facebook group, which by the way,  you guys, we, we have a free Facebook group at, uh, art of Dre art of D re.com.  Anyway, if I see somebody trying to sell something, dude, I kick them out.  I don't even give them a warning.  Um, because I hate that.

It says, hi, misunderstood.  Uh, you missed us, but this is going to be live here in just a second.  Um, go check it out.  Go check out Zach's site.  He, I've seen him take, and I've, I've talked to these people personally.  I've seen him take a handful of people to 10, 20.  There's one of the people that you train.  That's like, like, like at your heels, like almost to pass you.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  52,000 monthly career revenue.  He's like, I'm going to catch you.  I'm like sick, dude.  It's like, there's the Jedi, the apprentice and boom, you're going to,  bro, it's like, uh, inside of digital lines, we have Ryan Dalton.  He's at like 87,000 a month.  And I'm like, dude, this dude's coming at for me, but it's the best.  It's like the best compliment in the world that somebody that you train  passes you, but, uh, it still gives you a little fire.  Like, dude, no, no, no, I want to be at the top guy, you know?  So, but, um, so yeah, guys, I'm going to link up Zach stuff.  Um, I'll get his socials and everything.  But yeah, check out his website, Zach pal.co.  He started just like you guys had a JLB wanted to have freedom.  And, uh, he's basically living the, the Tim Ferris life, going to  Nicaragua, going to Hawaii.  Yeah.  They just built him and his wife.  He wouldn't tell you guys this, but he just built a new house.  Um, all this is since we met and since he started doing this.  Cause I think when we met, dude, you were making like six, I think you  had started the business, but you were making like sub 10 K and now you're,  it's like your entire life has changed, dude.  It's crazy thinking how much your life could change in a  couple of years, you know?  Yeah.  It's mind boggling looking at that timeline.  Yeah.  Um, a lot can change quick, man.  If you just commit daily consistency, you guys will get there.  So let me ask you one more question.  This is the last thing I'm going to ask you.  How did you get, what",

    "pageContent": "did, did your wife believe in what you were  doing when you first started?  And if so, how did you get her to, if not, how did you get her to it?  This is something I hear all the time is like, you know, in a lot of times  people have their spouse that doesn't believe in them because they have a  previous mess up where maybe they decided they're going to do something  and they completely flop, but how, how was your wife's support and how did  you get her on board with you?  Cause I'm of course now she's proud of you.  She's like, yeah, my husband's the man because like she, he's going to take  care of us, we have a great lifestyle and all this stuff, this brand new house.  But when you started, was that the case?  That is a great question.  Um, I think it's just like any relationship where trust builds over time.  And so ever since we got married, before we were married, my wife  saw my consistent effort.  We were dating when I was doing sales, selling direct TV, and she saw me put  in the work, put in the work, put in the work, and then it was a long time.  And there was this big investment, right?  To invest in a course.  I'd never bought a course before.  I never bought a group before.  It was a lot of money when you're making only 4,600 bucks a month, right?  I'm like, dude, I'm going to invest in this.  I better, I better make this work.  And my wife was like, you're about to drop thousands of dollars on this.  Are you serious?  And I was like, yes, I absolutely am going to, and it's going to be the best  decision we ever made.  I was so set because my mindset was, it wasn't, oh, I'm going to buy this  thing because I have some savings and give it a go.  It was like, I am going to do this.  I am committed and I will gain my freedom.  This will happen.  And so when I explained it in that way, I was like, babe, look,  people are doing this.  Other people have made this possible and I can hustle in that way.  I can hustle in that same way.  They're not any smarter than me.  Um, I can figure this out and I'm going to grind.  If it takes, I was committed for multiple years.  I was like, if I have to grind and I don't make money doing this for one  year or two years, that's okay.  I'm committed for the long haul because I have this vision of in five years, I'm  going to own a business like these other people, but I could see their timelines  and I could see people who were doing this in a year, two years.  And I was, okay, I'm going to commit for two years and see where I'm at.  I'm just going to grind, push every day, push every day.  And so when she saw that commitment, she was like, okay, we've never spent  this many thousands of dollars on anything, but like you have my trust  and you're going to do this.  It's going to be great.  So she gave me the green light and I'm like, so grateful that she did, you know,  she's a nurse.  And so she basically had all of our savings and was investing it in me,  which was an honor, but also like a responsibility.  So, um, that mindset going in to just be like, I'm going to make this",

    "pageContent": "work.  Um, I think it's kind of what you want to have.  Um, and that's how, like, if you're not, I guess on the other side, if you're,  if you're thinking right now, like, Oh, I'm not consistent.  I've said things and I don't do them.  Like that's okay.  The past is irrelevant.  All that we care about is now and each day moving forward.  So build the self-confidence in yourself day by day with those little decisions.  What are you going to commit to today?  Are you going to commit to waking up at a certain time?  Like start doing that thing.  Are you going to commit to go work out for 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes a  day, what level are you willing to commit to?  And if you do it every single day, you'll build that trust in yourself.  But the people around you, your wife, your spouse, they'll start seeing that  and they'll trust you more.  And they'll be like, he keeps his word.  He keeps his word to himself.  He keeps his word to his family.  I trust him with this big investment because he is consistent in all these  other areas, of course, he's going to be consistent in this too.  So I think it's just like a muscle.  If you feel like, Oh, I'm not consistent.  I don't trust myself.  Like you got to build that.  Start where you're at and just like little by little, boom, keep stacking  wins, keep stacking wins.  And once you're consistent with one thing, add another until now you're unstoppable  and you're just able to achieve everything that you want to super quickly.  So that's kind of my thought on that is build the trust.  If you don't have it work today on just building that little trust, you'll  strengthen your relationship with your spouse, you'll strengthen your  confidence in yourself and you'll get your results step by step, brick by  brick building over time.  Oh yeah.  I mean, dude, I had the same thing.  Like I was doing door to door and I proved myself, you know, and my wife was  like, yeah, okay, this guy knows what he's doing.  Like, and so then when I made my next decision, which was to start a software  company, I didn't even have to ask her.  But then of course that failed and it kind of lost her trust.  So then I was back on like, you have to continually make sure that people  around you know that you're going to take care of them.  It's like this big thing, especially I feel like with, uh, with, uh, oh shoot.  Can you still hear me?  Oh, there we go.  You're still good.  Okay.  My internet shake anyway.  Um, but then guys, the point being is that if you guys are having an issue  with your spouse or with your significant other, like having that belief in you,  it's probably because you don't, you've never given them a reason to trust you.  And so for me, when I got into this business, ultimately, like I had made a  mistake or two.  I had lost money in the stock market.  I w you know, I lost like $50,000 on a stock.  I didn't really properly check out.  And so I had to just make the, like, I, I tried to get her blessing and she's  like, basically it was like, no.  And I had to make, I had to, I had to just make the, uh, the presidential",

So I went ahead without her permission with the mentality, like I have to make  this work or I'm going to be toast for my entire relationship.  So, um, and that's exactly what I did.  And we had a little day or two where she was upset, but I was like, look, I'm  the one that's in charge of making money for this house.  I'm going to make this work.  And what, to your point, when you change your mentality from like, you know, I'm  going to give it a couple months or whatever, and you're like, I am going to  make this work because Zach Powell made it work, I can make it work, which  means it's possible and I will do it 10 years.  If it takes it, I'm not thinking about anything else.  I'm just going to focus.  You can make anything work.  You can go make money in an MLM.  You can make money selling fricking lotions and potions or door to door.  It's just that you have to change the mentality.  Like I'm going to do it until it works and remove all the distractions.  Um, and you can make it work.  So any of you guys that are hesitant about starting an SEO business, starting  a Legion agency, doing digital real estate, you, you can make money in anything.  You just have to do it long enough and you have to just say, I'm going to do it  until and the, and it will work.  It will work.  It's that simple.  So anyway, Zach Powell, I know it's like nine 15 to where you're at.  It's eight to eight 13 in the morning, dude.  Day's just getting started for me.  So thank you for hopping on again, guys.

What's  up Dev Nate? What's going on? Thad. We're seeing some OGs in here. Stephanie Prather,  what's going on? Jackson, my friend. What's up? Says he can hear us. Aaron Vogler, Fred  Sommer, Steven Pease, Richard Martes, Bo Hicks. All right. I think we wait just two, three  minutes and then I think we're just going to get into it. But what do you think about  that? Does it sound good? Let's do it. That works. I also recognize a bunch of these folks.  You can do some OGs in here, man. Yeah, I'm seeing some names. There's Porter, by the  way. What's up, Porter? He's probably out working on the farm this early morning. Matt  Torres. Guys, this is an exciting day. Yeah, let's just get into it. Let's just get into  it because I want to spend as much time as possible. We have 53 minutes and I want to  get as much possible. So guys, welcome to the call. Actually, let me do the everyone  tag really quick. That's what I'll do. I'm not even going to do any housekeeping. Why  doesn't it not let you do everyone from your computer? Is that the dumbest thing ever?  Dude, it's so weird. Like I, when I do a good lot of my group, I have to like open the group  in a different window and then comment in there or do it from my phone. I don't know.  It's like Mark Zuckerberg's figured out how to look like an alien on his own, but he can't  figure out how to use the everyone tag.  Yeah, or the whole issue. You connect to Zoom, I guess, right? Like the virtual is doing  it natively and why is it so hard to do that?  It's so hard. Like why are you making it so hard, Zucks? Okay, hold on. Let me see if I  can get it. There we go. Okay. At everyone. Boom. By the way, I had the weirdest dreams,  dude. David Beckham's son was in my dream. Dude, what a weird dream I had. Oh my goodness.

He's a float. He's a float. I love that. He is our, not basically,  he is our very first student ever to achieve this milestone. He has got a run rate of he's  going to be hitting a, he's, you've already made a million dollars in doing this business,  but now we're at big boy numbers, which is a million dollars per year as our run rate  and it's only climbing. So anyway, congrats to you, bro. Yeah, man. Thanks. Yeah. Homegrown  in digital landlords and art of reselling. I love it, dude. I love it. So, okay, guys,  here's what we're going to do.

They're, I think they, they're excited  as well because they've been hobnobbing different stuff together. So here's what we're going  to do. We, Ryan has been working on something for about 15 months. Is that about right?  Yeah. And I'm going to let him just share five minutes of the story behind it. And then  literally this entire, what I'm going to have him do is share his screen and I'm going to have him  show you guys what he has built and how seamless this is. And then at the end of this call,  we are going to be offering to a certain number of people, we're going to be offering a beta,  we're going to be taking on beta students. We've already started doing this with a select few,  but we're going to be taking on some beta students. So at any point, if you, if this  looks interesting to you, stick around to the end, because this would be the time to test this out.  What do we have? Like five people that have just, for a few days, we haven't really had  many issues at all. So when we say beta, basically you're just getting a deal at this point.  Yeah, you're basically getting a deal. I mean, it's not, it's not like, see, beta will sometimes  be used like incomplete, but that's not the case. Like it's very complete. You're, you're just like  one of the first users to know what you think. Now keep in mind, I will say this, I'll say this at  the end too, because we'll, we'll drop a link or whatever for the people that want to do beta.  This is a paid beta. So, you know, that just keep that in mind. This isn't a free base of paid beta  because this is a, something that's taken a lot of time, a lot of money, a lot of effort. Secondly,  because it's beta and there is a discount, expect that there could be a flaw. There could  be something that goes sideways and you have to be patient. That's why the discount is offered.  We don't anticipate there being that much that's weird about it or that goes sideways. However,  keep that in mind. So don't, don't hit up Ryan and say, oh my gosh, this, this little thing  happened. I couldn't log in instantly. Like there's going to be potentially some hiccups. So  that's part of the game. So just you've been warned. Okay. That said, I don't anticipate  there being many issues at all. But so Ryan, tell these guys what, what this, like why you built  what you built and guys, I, the title of this stream is what I think is going to describe this  tool as I think it's going to be the only tool you're ever going to need to scale your agency.  And I think the challenging part is going to be trying to figure out what to show them, what not  to show them because we only have 45 minutes. So right. All right. Let's get into it.  Yeah. We'll show them all the, all the fun stuff. It's all fun, but we'll show, we'll show them  good stuff. So, um, all right. So I've been in rank and rant for about two and a half years.  And I got into this and realized pretty quickly that there's not  a great solutions out there for tools. So we're usually, what happens is this,  as people get into this industry, they're like,",

    "pageContent": "Hey, listen, I want to do local lead generation  and they've got to go find a CRM. They got to find the right CRM, right? So their content relation  or their customer relationship manager, they've got to go find a keyword tool. They've got to  go find a site analyzer. They've got to go find programmable voice and messaging. So what happens  is inevitably everyone that does this business model is using three to four, at least different  tools at minimum, uh, that are all like scattered. And the problem with that is,  is the data doesn't talk to each other, right? So this was my frustration is there was not  anything out there. And, and, you know, there are some tools that do more things than others,  right? But there wasn't one that did it all. And so I found myself using a whole bunch of different  tools and having to manually connect that create the connective tissue and places where my data  needs to talk to each other. So, uh, I see we got, uh, Deb Nate on the call. Um, he said he used  version 1.0. So version 1.0 was a no-code solution connecting, uh, some of these things together,  where the users basically through like a sort of a mini course could go and connect these using sort  of off the shelf tools. Um, that was, that was great. We've got, you know, a lot of users that  use that, but it also had limitations that have a lot of limitations that I wanted to  make the next version to be a lot better. And so that's what we did. Right. So built, uh,  rank and run engine, uh, as it exists today. And it's got, uh, really everything that you need  to build an agency, no matter what level you're at. Right. So you can have, you know, be a million  dollar run rate, or you could be like at your first day or your first couple of sites or whatever.  And you've got everything you need in-house to grow and build your agency.  So I know that there wasn't like, besides Dave, uh, Dev, Nate, there was, you had at least a couple  hundred people that did this. Yeah, we've had over 300 that used it. And so it was so, it was like  unexpectedly popular. Like it started with just what I was using, like, Hey, this is how I built  my agency. And a buddy of mine, Alex, he, uh, he was like, Hey dude, you should have let other  people try this and see how this works. Cause this works really well. Cause I set it up for him and  worked great for him. And I was like, all right. And so I allowed, you know, really anyone to have  access to it. And a lot of people really liked it, but I also got like consistent feedback. Like  it was more involved to set up phone numbers. People have to set up these, you know, campaigns  and Twilio. And basically I looked at all of the places of version one that people said, Hey,  this part, can we make this better? And then built the version that we have today.  Yep. And like another, another person I know, uh, Mike V used it to scale. Uh, we had Mike V on  a couple of weeks ago. He's just hit $40,000 a month. So,  it was awesome. Uh, but he also set this up for me. It was, it was low cost. It was easy to use.  It was straightforward. And that's what we, we really enjoyed about it. So, um, I gave you co-hosts. ",

Some of the things it's going to eliminate and just kind of from a, I mean, there's going to be  a ton of stuff that we're not going to be able to get to, but basically, uh, this is going to be  a CRM, a, a search volume, a due diligence, basically all wrapped into one. That's going  to allow you to a project. I mean, everything all wrapped into one. Yeah, that's it. So the,  the goal is for, not the goal, what we did is to make it an all in one platform  to build scale and automates the tagline, right? So you can get it at rankinronengine.com. We'll  talk more about that at the end of the call, but, uh, that was the point is to make it all in one.  And you can read about it here. If you want to see like a super short seven minute demo, um,  I made one for you to just click on this to see, uh, you know, top to bottom, how it all works,  but I'm going to walk you through it and show you guys, uh, we've already got a bunch of people  that are starting to sign up for it. So pretty excited about, uh, about this. So let's start with,  um, just overview of the platform. I'm going to grab some water. Keep going. Great. Do your thing,  man. Uh, well, I'm just going to give you guys an overview of this platform and I'm going to show  you guys and gals, uh, what the value is for your agencies and why I built this, right? So ultimately  what I found is, is that a lot of people were using all these things in this left column.  There are free tools that were really bad or paid ones that were expensive  or having to use a bunch of paid tools that were expensive. Uh, and it really became like,  I don't know, expensive to, to run, to run an agency. And I noticed this cause I'm big on  running a lean agency and having like the most affordable and high performing way to do every  element of this business model. So, um, I'm going to walk you through this left hand column. Uh,  I think that you guys might be able to, uh, see this. If anyone can't see it, if I need to zoom  in, let me know. I'm going to make it a little bit bigger, but if you guys can't see it, let me know.  So, all right. I'm going to take you through each of these, uh, core features of rake and run engine  and show you how all these work together to build an agency. Right. The first thing is task tracker.  So, um, a lot of people will use things like, uh, Google sheets or notion or, uh,  monday.com or Trello, some of these organizational tools, um, that don't tie into the rest of your  agency. And so, um, I found that in my agency, I've either created or assigned 3000 tasks  to my team. So either ones that I've done or my team has done, and that has consistently moved  the needle forward. So I wanted to integrate that into this platform where you can keep track of  immeasurable, right? Anything in business needs to be measurable. So you're measuring how much  progress that you're making and what needs to be accomplished for your agency and allows you to  scale already with, you know,",

So if you want to bring in your team,  you're going to bring in VA's, it's really easy to just, you know, add them as a user to your  company and you can, uh, keep track of that. Right? So there's four categories here. There's  what needs to be done now, what we're working on in progress, what's been done is complete  and what maybe has some kind of blocker, right? This is project management 101 stuff. So, um,  I run a, uh, a hundred million dollar project, uh, for, um, the company that I worked for.  And, um, this is based on those principles, right? Project management principles, right? Because  that's what your business is. You're managing your business and you have got to make sure  that you're, uh, tuned into what's most important to move the needle forward.  So I'm not going to spend a lot of time on this part. Uh, it's pretty straightforward,  right? You put in, you know, your task title, right? So to do more bill events,  my keyboard is super loud. So I'm going to try to type a bunch, put in details here about  whatever that task is, uh, set priority levels, uh, you know, you can add your labels.  So, you know, what's involved to do bill events. Yeah. Uh, that you can add different options down  here, right? So we want to put new bill events and add it. There it is. Add it in, uh, task owner.  You can decide yourself or your team. Uh, so here I'm assigning it to me and then, uh, everything  matters about due dates. So we're going to do this on Halloween. And then you can all color code it  because I'm a nerd like that, right? So when we create this, you can, you know,  add images and all that kind of stuff. It's not, let me click, hold on and make this a little bit  smaller. Oh, task details is required. Um, test. Okay. And so you will begin to fill this up with  what's most important for your agency. So you can add images, you can, you know, like tag people,  put in comments. This is mission control. So, uh, I have used this extensively in version 1.0 and  it's been the, the most, uh, valuable thing for me to go back and measure what kind of results  am I getting and where am I putting my attention? Cause where you put your attention is where you're  going to get your results. All right. And that's what task tracker is about something that's a little  bigger. Real quick. Um, just, I think I might've missed this or maybe you covered it already.  Or if my team, I have a VA or whatever, I can assign this task to them.  Totally. So if I go in here and I click edit right now, I'm the only user in here.  Okay. You can assign people here and you can assign the owner and you as the task right now  only shows me, but you could go and you can click on your users and you can add, um, more users in  here. All right. So you want to add more, you want to add your team and, uh, you can add seats  basically. Yeah. So again, where you put your attention is where you can measure your results  and that's what task tracker is about. Right. So pretty straightforward project management stuff.  So now we're getting to like the meat of this. This is a due diligence and we covered this, uh,  over the",

Uh, on last week's call, we showed  this Nick, you think like talk a little bit about this, but not going to the level of detail of  last week or you want to go forward? I definitely think we should talk about this and guys, I think,  um, you know, we've been taught for a long time. I mean, months, we, people have been said, you know,  what's the state, like what's, uh, uh, the search volume that gives us confidence to go into what,  what is the minimum search volume? And we've purposely not necessarily said, well, on this  tool, it's this because we haven't, we don't have any control over Semrash or mangles or anything.  Now we do. And so now we're going to be able to go in and over the next month, as we're also,  you know, playing around with it, putting our agencies, uh, completely on this tool,  we're going to be able to come up with a minimum search volume to say, Hey, if the tool says this,  you can, you know, with 90% confidence, be sure there's going to be enough search volumes. I'm  really excited about that. But any of you guys that are paying for Semrash and, uh, then you're  paying for that tool and this tool and whatever this right here is going to do everything that  you need. If it's just for this feature alone, like I realized I was paying 120 is $129 or $119  for Semrash. I still haven't figured out, is it SCM rush or is it Semrash? I I've gone back and  forth. I don't even know what the proper term is, whatever it is. Only thing I use that tool for  is search volume. Like from the beginning, I've probably spent a hundred bucks a month, I spent  let's just call it a thousand bucks a year, which is less than it is for, I probably spent five to  $10,000 on the search function of Semrash. And that is this one piece of this tool.  What am I going to talk about real quick, or I would cover it a little bit, but tell them how  this data is, it doesn't go through any third parties. It comes directly into this tool.  Yeah, absolutely. So, um, you're looking at due diligence records here. So, uh, you know, we'll  dive into this and how we get this data, but I realized that there's such a variance in what  data is out there. At the end of the day, uh, you gotta have the most accurate data to make decisions  about which markets to enter. So this is a due diligence tool that automates this process,  right? Where you will put in the essential information that you need to understand your  market. And then you're going to get it spit back out, you know, what exactly the keyword,  search volume, cost per click, and then your competitor analysis looks like.  So, um, speeds up the due diligence process tremendously. Uh, you can pretty quickly  assess if you've got a good market to go into, um, because it's also going to pull in population.  So, um, I looked at like where this data comes from and what the most accurate data is. So this  is being pulled straight out of a keyword planner where I'm getting it straight from the source.  This is coming straight from Google. And so Google is saying, Hey, this is what the search  volume is. This is what the cost per click is. And if you're not getting, you know, uh,",

So one of my frustrations was  some of these other tools like main goals or whatever, um, would give a number for that,  but it was a guess. And when I would run ads, it would be like very wrong.  And so, um, having this pulled in with my due diligence into the same records, uh, for competitor  analysis, you know, really allowed me to see what a picture, a snapshot of that market looks  like. Um, so let's do an example. Um, Hey, real quick, Ryan, before we go any further,  just a quick question from Gina. She said, can you add attachments or documents to the task?  Yeah, sure can. So, um, you can upload files. Amazing. Yeah. So you can just add,  yeah, um, uh, like a PDF or something like that. You could add to it. That's awesome.  You have images, logos, whatever you'd add. Yeah. Beautiful. And then real quick, one more thing,  just so we're keeping on top of these, Daniel Kelly says, so does rank and rent engine do away  with the need to have multiple subscriptions? Answer is yes. Assuming that he's talking about  having man goals and SEM rush and these things. This is the old guys, the only tool you need to  scale. That's why I call it that live. That's called the live this, but anyway,  I think that's what he's asking. Um, yeah. Absolutely. That's the, that's how we built it.  This is the, this is the definitive tool that you need for this industry, right? So for local lead  generation, you don't need anything else to grow. Now you may have some like, you know, something  that you do with Adobe Photoshop for your editor images or whatever. It didn't have stuff like that,  but like the essentials from local lead generation are here. This is everything you need.  Beautiful. Okay. Sorry to cut you off. I just want to stay on top of that.  So, but real quick, I just want to say on this guys, this is this again, the cool part about  this from what everything that I've seen so far is each one of these, like for example,  task tracker. I remember at one point in my career, I paid for a program or a software  called pipe drive, right? All pipe drive does is exactly what task track tracker does, which is,  I mean, it does it for your clients or whatever, which we're going to show you that this also does,  but basically you just create these cards and you drag them. That's basically all that it did. And  I was, I think it was like 50 bucks a month. And that's what task trackers now due diligence.  I don't know about you guys, but I was one of those people in the beginning. I had stacks. I  used to print off the due diligence. I would print off like 50 at a time, keep them on my desk.  I'd take a pen and I was writing the information that I had stacks of these  hundreds of these due diligence sheets. And then I thought I graduated and I was so smart and I  went to Google drive. And now I have so many, and I've got, you know, folder inside a folder,  inside a folder, inside a folder, inside a folder to get to, you know, and I've got it by niche and  all this different stuff. Whereas this now I can log into my tool. I have my tasks and I have my  search volume and I have my due diligence cards. And I think I",

You've got to map out where you're going to put  your, your sites. So it's unlimited. Right.  And one other thing I like a lot who here has done the research on, let's say Las Vegas concrete.  It doesn't look good or it does look good or whatever. You decide not to do it. And then like  six months later, you're like, Oh, I should go into Las Vegas concrete or somebody hits you up  and says, you know, you get a referral or whatever. And you're like, I remember doing  the due diligence and you go back and you're like, Oh, I should probably do it again to see  if it's like up to date. Guess what? All you have to do now is push one button.  You go to it, you push refetch, correct? And it automatically runs the entire due diligence  right within, what is it? Two and a half seconds, three seconds.  It's pretty much instant. So you can refetch it or you can go in here and here's a, here's one for  Brick Masonry in Nashville. Click edit. If you want to switch out your keywords, right? Like maybe  we don't like retaining wall, but we like, you know, brick wall. I don't know. I'm just  going to make up something. And we want to update our keyword because we found that maybe it's  successful in other markets, right? We just go in here and we just update the location and it's  going to refetch that data. So brick wall is a tool. Actually it's not a bad keyword, 140  search volume. I don't know what the cost per click is, but you just edit that record and it  pulls in the latest competitor data as well, right? So their domain age, authority, backlinks,  page authority, citation flow, and trust flow. And it'll refresh all that for you where, you know,  if you're kind of waiting, kind of eyeing it, right? Maybe, you know, your work sure, like your  market was marked to be determined up here. And you're like, all right, I got to look at Masonry  in Nashville. Like, all right, this is pretty good. And you can mark it and go.  Um, let's just do a little math. Let's say you're, how long do you think it takes to do,  take this tool out? Let's say the standard way. How long do you think it takes you to do a due  diligence? I would guess for me, probably about 30 minutes. Yeah, that's probably right. I'll say 30  minutes. Let's say you're average. Let's say you're not making that much money. Your time's worth  $100 an hour, right? So let's say that 50 bucks every time you do one of these, what it costs you.  And let's say that you do, you know, for every area, you have to look at 10. So let's say to do  10 sites, you have to look at 100. So 10 is up by 100. That costs you $5,000 worth of your time  to look at due diligence. You just literally eliminated that with this tool. I mean, it's  insane. It takes you instance three seconds or less to get the same information. It take, it would  take you 30 minutes to get. Yeah. Yeah. Look, I mean, money loves speed, right? You said it a  million times. It's",

Not to mention you might miss something because  you're human and you, you, you know, incorrectly anyway. So of everything, dude, the search volume  and the due diligence, this might be my favorite part of the entire tool, but piece of it.  Yeah. We spent a lot of time on the due diligence part to really make sure this is  going to grab what you need. I see some of these questions in the chat. So  I'll just talk through, when you add a record, this only works in the US for right now. We're  going to expand to other markets outside the US, but you know, your country is the United States.  You pick your state, you put in your city, you put in your niche, call driven, yes or no. That's  just a reminder, like, you know, are we in the right niche? You're putting your primary keywords.  This is your money keyword. Like this is the one, this is masonry, this is artificial grass,  this is concrete contractor, this is fence installation. And then you put up your core  keywords, which are the next six. So those are the ones that you're going to build your service  pages out of when you build service pages. These are, you know, your core keywords and it covers  that and the due diligence modules, right? And then you need to look at how many active  businesses there are. Maybe now you don't know you market TBD and then you put in your top three  competitor domains, right? So I just grabbed some URLs here. These are just kind of ones I, you know,  put in and you're going to put in these domains. You can put in an available domain. So this is  grayed out right now because I've already added it. But you'll put, you'll put in this big brick  energy Nashville for a brick mason, but you can, you know, edit whatever your domain is that,  you know, you check GoDaddy for to make sure you could buy the domain. Loading fruit, TBD,  go or no go TBD, or maybe you already have a vibe for it and then you update the location,  right? And it's going to pull in that data automatically. So you can see that it just  loaded while we've been talking here, right? So all that data that you normally have to go  type in domain age, like pull up domain authority, like how many backlinks, right? Like  that is completely unnecessary. That's one of the things that frustrate me most is  you just can make it the right API calls to the right services and you're going to get  the data that you need. Yep. Beautiful. So let's just rapid fire through some of these questions  because I know we're going to be just cutting it close here. So real quick, Richard said,  I'm doing my business with my spouse. So can I assign a task to both of us  or can she edit a task without being an admin? Yeah. So there's one company admin. So under users,  there's the one admin, you can add someone as a seat on there who is, you know, an administrator,  or you can both use the same account, you know, with the same password. If you want equal admin,  right? So I don't know how you feel about that, but the invited users will appear here. So if you  want to add somebody in, you can both be on the task. So this task here, you can assign, you can  have, you know, the owner, you can have the person that's assigned to it and all that",

So it's designed for collaborative, you know, working together, right?  Beautiful. Okay. So answer that one is yes.  Prabh says, just hopping off, can we use this for SEO? Of course you can use this for SEO.  LeadGen is SEO. We're just doing LeadGen. We're just doing SEO for ourselves, right?  Richard says, is it pulling the competitor data on its own without entering that information?  So I think your question is, is it pulling your top three by just virtually knowing what the market  is? And the answer is no, you have to go in and you have to look at what your top three are, right?  Because, you know, you've got to go see what those top three websites are for the ones that you want  to beat. But all you have to do is paste the URL in here. So which is a good thing, by the way,  because if not, maybe it would pull in like a home advisor and stuff like that. And we all know that  home advisor, even though they may be your spot number one, they're not the same type of a  competition as a local competitor, because Google likes to give the spot to the local. So yeah,  you're going to go in, you're going to just choose those three, the ones that you keep seeing over  and over, and boom, then you're going to have that information. So it's going to take you just a  second. Bo asks the same question, how is it picking the top three competitors? So that's one,  you're going to put in the top three competitors. Again, we can't, unless we had a formula that said,  get rid of home advisor, do this, do this. There's no way that we could do that, because it would  just be pulling the top three. And sometimes that would be the home advisor or Angie's list, which  in which case it wouldn't be accurate. So that you do put in the top three competitors.  Yeah. Yeah. There's limits to good software and automation. Like the best way to do it is to have  a human in the loop, right? You want to have a human that is looking at that data and saying like,  yeah, these are the top three, you plug those in and then everything else is done automatically  for you after that. Okay. Beautiful. I agree. Gina says, I have stuff scattered everywhere.  This is amazing. I a hundred percent agree with you. And then Bruce has said to this DD tool,  find your top competitors. Well, no, that's, we covered that as well. Okay. Last one, Daniel  Kelly says, not related to ranking or Angie, but would appreciate some input on choosing a niche.  I joined last week. I spent a while looking at a tree service, but it seems almost impossible to  rank for an ultra competitive. So I'd appreciate some ones Nick would recommend. Okay. I'll comment  with some of the recommended ones. So we don't have to stop on that one. Daniel, just give me a  second. I'll respond there. And then Kirk says, perhaps it could screen out. Yeah, it could. But  again, as Ryan said, I think having a human in the loop is the best option, but it's not something  that we can't update going forward. And then Raphael says, do I still need to use Google  keyword planner for ads? No, you don't. So we can jump around here. We don't have to go in order.  Uh, so I'm sure you keyword",

Um, everyone thinks concrete saturated literally yesterday when I was on  the call, uh, with, I was going to call it Jason. He had to hop off. Jason already had to hop off,  get on a closing call. He got on like 15 minutes later, 30 minutes later, and he closed a $1,400  a month deal in concrete. There are deals out there. I'm not saying that you should go into  concrete, but if you look hard enough, there's still deals. So, um, yeah, use old faithful for  us. Yeah, we, we can, we can switch up. We do, uh, we'll do Mason. Let's do a fresh one. Right. So,  um, I still get deals in concrete. Uh, we're we'll have a closing call this week for concrete. So,  uh, I don't think it's, well, let's, let's do another one. Let's do, uh, let's do Mason. Right.  So this data is your keyword planner, right? So think about how much time is lost hopping  between all these platforms. You're not only paying for them, but you're jumping between them  back and forth and it's, it's slowing you down. So, um, this is something that I felt very acutely.  I don't want to have to always be jumping back and forth. You also have data fidelity issues when  that happens, right? Like, am I making sure that I'm putting the right data in? Is my team putting  the right data in? This is pulling straight from the source. This is pure keyword and, uh,  calls per click and search volume data. So, uh, we did Masonry, Nashville area, search volume,  calls per click. You can see the PPC competition level, right? So, um, the, you know, low, uh,  and then the competition is just shown here as low, right? So, um, it also pulls your low, uh,  top of page bid and your high top of page bid to see what it's going to cost you to get at the top  of the page. Uh, and then you're obviously your average monthly search volume, uh, over the course  of the last year. And then related keywords, right? So all the Mesa Green near me, um, if it  doesn't have the data for that, it's not going to make up a number. This, again, this is what  frustrated me about some of these other tools is it will make up a number based on, you know,  whatever data brokers are pulling from, because that's what these keyword planners do is they go  buy data from, from places. And, um, I found this to be pretty unreliable. I want as accurate as I  can get. And if Google doesn't know, like, I need to know that, right? So, uh, this is a great  example of the, like, you know, you put in that core keyword, this is my primary keyword and,  you know, I'm going to get that, that search data to pull up. Beautiful. So I'm just looking at  comments. Uh, Mike V is a tool limited to the United States. Obviously not all the features,  but some of the, uh, the competitor analysis features, that kind of stuff. Um, of course that,  that's, this is just beta. So we're going to be working on that, but yes, it is. Um, Aaron Smith  said,",

And Richard said, is there  a way to save previous keyword planner searches? Oh, that's a great idea. Yeah. So I've been talking  to the developers about that. What we'd like to do is have a keyword search history where you can  just select if you want to go back and look at that, that doesn't exist now, but you guys,  this community drives the development of this tool. This is made by people doing rank and rent  for people doing rank and rent. So, you know, as you guys are using this tool, I've got a,  you know, up here in this corner, I've got a support button that you can click and you can say,  hey, I've got this idea. Hey, why don't we do this? I'm going to take what the,  what the people want and build it. Right. So things like that, that we continually,  we'll make this the best in class tool for this industry. And, uh, you know, you guys are,  are the ones that are informing that. Beautiful. What else should we cover? We have time to cover  like, what else do you want to cover, man? We have programmable. So I want to talk about the  biggest thing that you need for retention in this industry. And so let me tell you in 30 seconds,  how I know this. I will also, in my agency, close sites for site owners. And one of the things that  I coach the site owners who bring sites to me, they want to get them closed and on a profit  split. Basically I'll say, Hey, you need to have a text message SMS notification set up in your  programmable voice so that the business owner knows that you're getting those leads over to them,  right? Where every time a call comes in, they get a text message that says you have a new  lead from, and it shows the number. So what I've done is, um, when you guys get a number here,  your first ones are included for free with your subscription. This has a full suite of programmable  voice and messaging. So you can go in here and you can, you know, pull up this number and this  one is for a little rock concrete, right? That exists. It's not a real site. I'm sure it's a  real site for someone under that domain, but I just put some information in here. Um, and so you  could put in your, you know, all this information in here, right? So you can put in your tracking  number. You're, um, uh, pulled in automatically. You can put in your forwarding number and then  down here, all of this stuff right here is about retention. So, um, when the call comes in, you  want to be able to enable spam filtering or not. So one of the key complaints that business owners  give is about spam. And they're like, Hey, I get great leads, but I've got this spam coming in.  All you got to do is enable spam filtering. And now when someone calls, they press, uh, one to  connect to the business owner, right? They hear a message that says something like, um, press,  thank you for calling, uh, press one to be connected to one of our team. And the call will  actually not go through until someone presses that input. So it saves you with one click, uh,  spam concerns from your business owners. Um, you can choose your whisper message, male or female.  It's also got",

    "pageContent": "state law compliance for call recordings. So, uh, you can click this right  here to play it and listen to it if you want to. But basically it's just that message that says  this call may be monitored or recorded for quality assurance or training purposes, which is,  um, required by state law. If you do two party, uh, call recordings or one party call recording  or other, right? So not true for every state, but it's true in a lot of states. And so I just leave  it on by default to be compliant. Um, and then you can put in your whisper messages here, right? So  you can do, uh, there's a default one that says, Hey, you have a new call generated from Little Rock  Concrete, or you can do a custom one. If you want to like, Hey, Nick, uh, you have a call from  Little Rock Concrete, like put in my business owner's name there. Uh, do you ask, does this  take place a call rail? Yes. You can put in, uh, you, your numbers that exist now already,  if you want to, or excuse me, or you can, uh, get new numbers through program of voice SMS.  So let's say I have a call rail account. What I is there's a way to like bring all my numbers in and  then get rid of my call rail account. Yeah. So we're going to do a number of, uh, porting, uh,  in the future, right? We don't have porting set up, but what you can do is you can keep that number  there. You don't have to buy numbers here. Uh, your numbers are included with your subscription  up to a certain amount. Um, and then, uh, you can just add in your numbers here into your  sites, into your site portfolio, right? Where you just type in what the number is instead of  add a new one. So you keep that for now, your existing sites, you'd keep your call rail account  and keep those numbers and, uh, and then you're, but going forward, new numbers,  you could buy directly through this, through Twilio. And then once we, uh, add porting as  part of, as one of the new features, then, um, you can go ahead and, and we could get rid of that.  Absolutely. Yep. Yep. Um, and the cool thing about these numbers is on the backend,  they have got a feature that I love is that you can do, if you do Google business profile  verifications, you can do those through, uh, these numbers, through, uh, the call,  whereas call rail blocks that. It doesn't let you do it. So, uh, pretty neat little, um, difference  there. Here's the real moneymaker for me. I would not even do local lead generation if not for what  I'm about to show you guys. Like I would not do it. It would be too frustrating for me.  And that is SMS notifications. So, um, when the call comes in by default, this is enabled.  It's going to show you have a new lead from, and then it shows the site name automatically  pulled in and then the caller's number. And so that business owner, every time they get a call,  uh, it says you have a new lead from, and it shows that, that phone number. And so it keeps you  top of their mind. They are thinking like, okay, I'm getting these leads. They're still coming in.  We've already blocked out the spam because we turned on spam filtering and they're getting  this text message. And every time that they get that new lead coming in,",

    "pageContent": "they're seeing the value  of your service. So this has been like the number one most valuable thing for me in my agency.  I've baked it into a rank and run engine. So just from the jump, you've got access to it.  I love that. That's it's so valuable because it, um, you like, even if you, even if it's only 10  leads or 15 leads or whatever, just constantly reminding them, you know, that you're there,  Hey, you know, it's like, you're poking them and say, Hey dude, that's me. That's me. That's me.  Cause a lot of times these business owners, even though it's coming from you, they want to assume  it's from their own stupid little go daddy site. And, and they would do everything to be like,  Oh, I don't think so. I don't think so. Right. This is going to show them that like, this does,  this does indeed come from you. So this is a great retention tool. And for those of us that  have done nothing for retention and still retained people, imagine this is just going to be one more,  you know, a nail in the coffin to keep these people just locked in with us. So, um, and by  the way, uh, did you enable that or is that default? By default, they have this, you could  customize it and change it, right. You put in, you know, a name or whatever, right. But by default,  they get an SMS lead notification. I could see really buttering up the business owner and be  like, hello, boss. Uh, here's a little call. Yeah. Something like that. Anyway. Yeah, man.  Yeah. So, uh, you get all your tracking numbers in here. You can get a new one straight through  the platform, right? So, you know, if you want to get, you know, your, your new tracking number,  you can get it, configure it just like I showed you guys a second ago. Right now it's just the  U S my idea. Love you, man. Sorry. It's not there for New Zealand yet, but we'll get you hooked up.  Um, and then you'll, uh, be able to get those numbers, but, uh, right now it's just the U S  but it's, it's, you know, it's everywhere in the U S so, uh, you can get those numbers and you can  see your first ones are included for free on your account. Beautiful. How many, how many are included  for free? Uh, your first five on your, if you do ignition, if you do full throttle, sorry, ignition,  it's five turbo charges, 20 in full throttle. It's 50. Those are the three different levels.  Okay. Beautiful. And then you can, you can add your own, uh, as well, right? So you can do add  on numbers, uh, very affordably. So, uh, let's co can we cover one more, one more, uh, feature  and then we can do a few questions and we can, uh, let anyone, we can share the beta information  that want the people that want to, uh, get on the beta for a discount.  For sure. Yeah. So, uh, we're going to cover this last one here, but, you know,  I'm just going to run through these. You can do site portfolio. All your sites are in one spot,  uh, put in all your sites, prospects, put in all your prospects, clients, all your clients show  up here, right? You can put in the service type SEO",

You can check all your leads here,  and then you can see all your calls and the recordings. But the one I'll show you guys is  this one. Uh, this is site analyzer. So this will allow you to go in and look at the performance of  your own sites or look at your competition sites. So I put in, you know, one of my Legion sites here  and, you know, you can see all the essential metrics at these cards, the top citation flow,  trust flow, domain authority, page authority. Are you improving at these metrics over time  to outrank your competition? Um, you can see your backlink profile, right? Like how many are you  gaining the last 12 months? Uh, how many of you gained a loss over the last 12 months, right? Uh,  here, this gets a little bit technical. I'll probably don't have time for all this, but  gets into your referring IPs, your referring subnet nets and your external backlinks, and then, uh,  your top referring domains, which you want some diversity on. So, uh, referring domains, uh,  all times showing all the, the top ones where you're getting backlinks from basically and what,  their trust flow and citation flow looks like. And then your anchor texts, right? Like how much  anchor text diversity do you have and, uh, what kind of referring domains, all the essential  information that you need that will give you an insight into the performance of your own  lead generation site. And, you know, you can put in competitors too, right? So you can do your own  or you can do another one, but, um, all that data gets piped into this, this one, uh, dashboard for  you. Is it safe? You analyze it and then does it just read, when you put the new one, it doesn't  get rid of this. Is it just like a standing tool or does it save past searches? Yeah, it'll put  a new one in. So let's do, uh, oh, I didn't do that commonplace. Um, this is for like, uh,  assessing a site at a time. If you want to do a due diligence record, you could pull that in  for due diligence, right? So if I go back, it's just gonna, it's gonna refresh it. Um, but we'll  add a, um, search history, like, uh, you know, here's the ones that you've done, the results  that they got. So we'll add that in the future. Yeah. Beautiful. Okay. I think that's something  we should add. I think it'd be nice. Concrete. One thing I want to mention guys is you can finish,  you can finish this. Let me, so each one of these tabs is basically replacing a software tool,  right? Like that's how, like I was just looking at it. Task tracker. Um, we, I mean, we've used all  kinds of different stuff. I told you, we used to use, uh, like, what's this? There's notion,  right? We use notion for task tracker, then the due diligence. We used Google sheets and we used  SEMrush and then the site portfolio. We would use, uh, we used everything from Asana  to Google sheets to pipe. Like I don't know what else we use. We said that was prospect pipeline.  I used pipe drive client list. We use Entraport, like lead tracker, call rail. It's like every  single one of these I was paying or using a different tool. Even if I wasn't paying,  I",

And now each one of these little tabs on the  left here is replacing a piece of software, putting it into one place that you can just,  you know, scale your entire agency from, which is incredible. Money loves speed.  That's the goal, man. Put it all in one spot. It doesn't need to be in 10 different places.  It just creates inefficiencies. Here's the most important part. Can I put my own profile picture  in the corner? For somebody like me, that's real. You can put it in the goofy avatars, right?  Okay. But you can actually upload a picture. Yeah, you can upload your picture.  Amazing. Obviously guys, that's not the most important thing, but I thought it's kind of a  nice little touch. Okay. So let me look at this really quick. We have a few minutes. I'm super  pumped to get my team in playing with it, me getting in playing with it.  Let's just do a couple of questions. Then we're going to share the information on the beta. Okay.  So let's see. Man, we got so many questions. Let me start at the bottom, actually.  Jahil says, I joined late, but I have a question about the site portfolio section. Is there some  type of filtering system where we can split sites we have rented from the sites we don't have rented?  Yeah, for sure. So you could show ones that are in development, right? And those are basically  unlimited, right? You could put just tons of in-development ones in there. And then when  the development status is complete, you could put a market is complete and then edit whatever  details you need to in here, right? So you can do your service type by lead generation, SEO,  paid advertising, whatever your site is, and then indicate whether you actually have a client on it.  So under your client list, you can tie it to a website, right? So that website will be assigned  to a client and then they'll know if it's rented. Beautiful. Okay. Jeremy says, hey Ryan, congrats  on building such a promising tool. It looks really great. Sorry if they've already been asked. I'm on  the job. So you got a couple of questions. Let's rapid fire. And I know some of the answers,  so I'll answer them. Can we bring in our own Twilio numbers, bring your own key style or  must we purchase them in rare? They'll eventually be able to be ported in. In the meantime,  what you can do is you can, when you create a site, you can just put in the phone number,  the number you like to tracking number, or you can just add your own.  Perfect. Number two, he says, if not, can we pour our tracking numbers in out of rare?  Not yet, but that is, that has been asked a couple of times. So that's going to be at the top of what  we want to, we want to update the next update. Okay. Does it have a web browser dialer in it  so we can call the leads via the website tracking number? I don't think so right now.  No. Okay. And again, guys, as it's crazy, because as you guys are asking these questions, it's,  it would be really impossible to cover like from, remember this is version like, you know, 1.0,  it's a version 2.0 of rare, but this is version 1.0 of this being an actual tool. And I think  you've covered basically everything. So of course, there's going to be these little teeny  things that are",

    "pageContent": "nice, whatever, but just keep in mind, there are going to be a lot of updates  coming. This is just where we're starting at. Okay. One more question. He asks, he said, I see  on your website, it says you only support USA number at this time. Do you have an estimated  timeline for Canada and other countries? I don't know if we have a timeline, but of course,  by popular demand, it's probably the order that we'll tackle. It'll probably be Canada slash  Australia would be the second one. And then of course, Mike V, we got to hook up Mike V. He's  over there just carrying the whole country on his back over there in New Zealand. New Zealand love.  Yes. Okay. And then let's keep just a couple more and then we're going to have to go through  and just answer these. Bruce says, one last question. Will you be doing a bit further  training inside of the rare Facebook group? Yeah. So I made a ranking or an engine Facebook group.  We can share that here, basically for this community, people using this platform. So if you  guys want to join that, just search ranking or an engine and jump in. There's not much there right  now, but I intend to share more trainings and more product roadmap and things like that. So you guys  are constantly getting the latest from me in there as well. Let's answer one more question and we'll  get into beta stuff. Luke Hill, and I think this is important, he says, so why wouldn't Google give  that on Google Keyword Planner or why wouldn't other tools like Ahrefs or SEMrush use the same  API? Why do you think that is? Because we're talking about how this data isn't going to third  parties. Why do you think they're not using that? Good question. I can't speak for why other  platforms were built the way that they were. Every keyword tool has its little nuances,  has its differences, right? For our industry, we are very focused on the local search volume,  the local keywords. There's nothing built for that. It's like, what is the fastest path to  knowing in that local market what that search volume is, what that cost per click is, right?  So I chose like, hey, the gold standard for this after running, you know, I've ran probably $300,  $400,000 of ads now is going to come from Google, right? That is the place to get the gold standard  of information and data for me. And so I wanted to tie that in, right? I can't speak to some of  these other choices for the way they build theirs. They're catering off into much bigger  corporations, right? Like how many people are searching for sneakers by Nike, right? You know,  that's not what we're doing. And so I built our tool bespoke for our use case.  Which I think is super interesting because a lot of people with tools, they want to, they're like  thinking, well, I want to, I want to build this tool so that we can get people in this industry,  in this industry, in this industry want to make. And of course, this is a moneymaking product.  Ryan's isn't just a charity. However, Ryan makes his money from doing rank and rent. And so this is  not only, of course, it's a way to make money, but it's also a way to scale his rank and rent  agency even further. And so I think the best products, the best tools always come from people  inside that industry because they know the pain points. Whereas somebody from the outside coming  in to build it just to make money, it's never going to cater",

We'll try our best maybe to either do like a Q and a session later,  or just go in and answer these questions. But how do people, if they want to get on the beta  discount, how do they sign up? And what does that look like price wise, et cetera? We have 38 people  on, let's show them that really quick. Give them the link and let them go start playing around with  this amazing tool. For sure. Yeah. Yeah. Nick hooked it up. You guys are getting early access.  So you go to rentandrentengine.com. You can click create a free account. And then for the first 50  people that use Ignition 24, so all capitals, no spaces, Ignition 24, one word, will get 20%  off. So the first tier is 97 bucks a month. You can cancel your main goals. You can cancel your  SEM rush, right? Like you're going to go in here and see that, you know, this is very much a cost  savings tool for you guys. And you're getting 20% off on top of that. What's the code? Ignition 24.  That's the first two months at 20% off. So IGNITION24. We can put it in the, in the chat  or 24, all lowercase, all uppercase. So you know, it's case sensitive, but I just put it in.  Oh, I misspelled it. Time too fast. I don't delete that comment. All right. Ignition 24,  like starting a car night. Beautiful.  Also real quick, Daniel Kelly. Okay, good. I spelled it correctly too. Okay. Daniel Kelly,  go look at your previous comment. I dropped the recommended niches for you specifically. I  spent some time to write that comment out. So guys, if you are interested  on a 20% discount for the first, I think it's 50 people is what it's capped at. What we're,  and by the way, this is coming to you guys first. We haven't taken this to the free group. We haven't  taken this to, you know, whatever. We're going to be doing an official, official, official, official  launch next, probably in about a month, depending on how this beta test goes. Could be as early as  two weeks, but most likely first of November. But yeah, go in, play with this and just know that  you guys are, you guys are our people. We're excited. We want to get as much feedback as  possible. If people have feedback, where would be the best place? Should they go in the Facebook  group and drop a comment? Because I don't want to make a huge mess here, like DMing you and stuff  like that. Where should they go for support? Should they go to the Facebook group and drop a  question, comment? Like what would be the quickest way to give feedback?  Yeah. If they want, it's only positive things that I accept. No, I'm just kidding. If you want to go  to ask feedback, you could talk about it in the Facebook group, but if you want it the  most direct and organized way that I'm categorizing this stuff is when you create an account in this  top corner, you'll get your user profile information, click on support. It's going to pull up this form.  And so this form is going to be refreshed. Here we go. It's your rare user support request form.  So you put in",

If you guys would though, I mean, for the benefit  of the community, if you could do that form, it would make it easier for Ryan to address  these things and also update. So I know sometimes you get frustrated when a fire off a message  and, you know, whatever, but if you guys will do that, maybe you do both. If you're really,  it's a really quick thing you want to get answered, but this is going to allow Ryan to continue to  make this tool even better and better. Okay. So one more time. Okay. Shane real quick says,  awesome. Can you increase your package at any time? Sure can. Yep. You can also do add on sites. So  if you've got 10 sites, you can do add on sites as well without having to upgrade your package.  Or you can, you know, choose the highest tier if you want to. Right. So anytime that's available  for you guys. And then Jahil has a good question. He said, how does the search volume, how does the  search volume do when searching for Metmo? That's exactly, well, guys, this tool, as of last week,  right when we went live, that was like when we started basically being able to play with it as  well. So that's one of the things that I'm going to be looking at in the next few weeks  is when we type in a Bentonville concrete, when you type in that, that key site, what is that minimum  search volume? So, uh, stay just a little bit patient with me as we figure that out. I don't  want to come out and say, Oh, when it says this, you know, then that's a, uh, for sure, because I'm  not a hundred percent there yet, but this is now I'm confident because we have control over the tool  that we can give you that with a 90% confidence rating type of thing. So, um, again, guys,  if you are interested in the beta, go to rankandrentengine.com and choose your package.  And then the ignition all caps, we think ignition 24, maybe not case sensitive. I don't know to get  20% off, uh, for the first, how many months? Two months, first two months. And then one more thing,  Matt says, could an overseas VA team call using the tracking numbers? Uh, there's not anything to  have, uh, those dial out right now. Um, but I've got some ideas for that. So stay tuned. Beautiful,  beautiful. Okay. I think we, I mean, I think that's pretty much it guys. Um, go test it out,  play with it. Uh, if you guys are like the lowest package is 99 bucks, 97, you get a 20% discount.  We're at, let's call it 80 bucks, 80 bucks a month. SEM rush is 129 a month, just for the search  volume. Like it's at the lowest package, it's, it's a no brainer, especially with the, with the  discount. Okay. Um, you can use it for SEP. Okay. Anyway, um, Kirk says just registered,  but it's us only, do we lose out on the offer? Any idea on the UK feature?  Uh, so let's see, just registered. That's right. Yep. So it's, it's still just us",

Um, one thing on, uh, dial outs, there are third  party programs that you can use like talking to that you can actually plug in your, uh, SEP  and SID. Oops. Um, this SID, I haven't tested that with this yet. Um, but you guys might be able to,  do it that way, right? So, um, that's, that's a possibility in any case, in the future,  we'll be able to make it to where you guys can use your numbers for dialing out using tools,  um, either natively built in or third party, but, um, that doesn't exist right now.

    "pageContent": " Question, how do you handle the objection  when you are pre-qualifying a business owner of,  I wanna know how much it costs or what's the deal?  I come across this objection in a call yesterday  and I was at the point that I wanted  to hang up the phone and move on.  The fact that I said we could talk about it later  didn't work, she was another level of persistence.  So, Juan, I know we talk about this in the training,  I don't know if you've gotten through  the entire training yet, but I push it off  as much as I can, mainly because I wanna take people  through the whole process and I've experienced this before  when I hired my setter, she started getting familiar  with the process, she started hearing me pitch  and they would start asking her, they were interested,  if people are asking those questions, by the way, Juan,  those are really interested people,  those people are asking buying questions  and that's somebody that's a good look, okay?  They're asking the deal because they're internalizing,  could this be a good fit?  So, what you need to do is, what I train in the program  as I say, I say something to the effect of like,  hey, look, that's not even, that's way ahead  of what we're even talking about here.  Honestly, at this point, I just wanna get you  a couple of free leads and we can talk about that  in a couple of days, that's the easy part, ma'am.  Ma'am, that is the easy part, I've done it  and I always say something like, I've done everything  short of taking food stamps for payment,  knowing damn well that I won't do anything  besides flat feet, but I don't wanna get them all nervous,  I don't wanna get them thinking, oh, you know,  if I just say, oh, we do a flat feet,  all they're gonna do is they're gonna start thinking,  well, I don't like flat feet because it's not guaranteed  and I like to do paper lead and I wanna do a commission  and by the time you get to the call,  they're gonna come in and they're already gonna object  and they're gonna say, no, I don't wanna do a flat feet, okay?  But if you can shit on paper lead and commission  in that screencast right before you get on the call,  you're not gonna have any objections.  So, I just like to keep it open and let them think  that, you know, there's tons of options  and I'm really just looking to find the right person  before we talk about that.  Now, if they're ultra persistent,  which by the way, I've dealt with that before  and it just gets to the point where it's like,  you're gonna lose, they'll say, yeah,  we've done a couple of different things.  Most often, what works the best is doing something  that's on a flat rate, that way, you know,  your marketing budget isn't gonna soar up in the spring  when we get tons of leads and one thing I don't do,  by the way, is commission and I'll tell them straight up,  I'm like, the only thing I don't do is commission  and that's because you got no skin in the game  and I'll tell them straight to their face  because I will not do commission  and there's no skin in the game, that makes sense  and if they can't understand that,  I don't wanna work with that person  because they're stupid.  Commission deal is the most stupidest thing ",

I've done everything short of taking food stamps.  Let me get you a couple of these leads  and then a couple of days we can talk about it  if it ends up being a good fit,  but let's not put the cart before the horse,  something like that, okay?

That might not be the case because we've done a lot of legwork to start off, but if it ends  up being the case, just be okay with it.  Realize that that is time well spent and that it's going to be worth it in the long run  because you're going to be able to avoid a bunch of SEO, okay?  Let's go over to the screen.  All right, so we're over here, I'm going to have you grab, there's going to be a download  with the market research worksheet.  It's also in the Facebook group, it should be here in the training as well.  Just download that, and then what I want you to do is I want you to go and make a copy.  So, you know, hit make a copy, name it however you want, I like to put the service city,  I'll remove the template and go from there.  I've already done this, I'm going to show you.  I named it Concrete, Queen Creek, Arizona, due diligence, however you're going to remember  it doesn't matter, okay?  I fill out a few basic things, Concrete's the niche, it's 52,000 people, it should be  phone driven.  I keep this here to remind you, if it's a walk in business, if it's a dentist, probably  not the niche you should be in, okay?  But just trust me on the niches I'm recommending, so yes, it's a phone driven business.  Next, what we're going to do is we're going to take our keyword list from the niche we  decided on, which as I told you guys, if you can't decide, just choose Concrete.  We're going to take those keywords and we're going to use these keywords to see what the  competition looks like, because we want to rank for these keywords long term, so we want  to see what kind of competition we're up against.  Now, there's a word of caution, do not just do one keyword, do not type in Concrete,  Contractor, Queen Creek, Arizona, do the homework on that one keyword and then make a decision  based on that, because that's inaccurate.  What I mean by that is you could potentially see a city where Concrete, Contractor, Queen  Creek, Arizona is very, very competitive, and the other four, five, six terms that you  search for, no competition, okay?  You could also see the reverse, you look at one term, oh yeah, this is going to be awesome,  next four terms, it's crazy competition, and you get your butt handed to you, okay?  So you've got to use, and guys, I didn't do this, for years and years I didn't do this  because I was never trained to do this, and I got into a lot of hot water, and this is  part of the reason I had to get rid of so many sites.  So you're going to take your list and you're going to take your core keywords.  Now, as I told you, you should only have five to seven, I don't know why we have nine here,  I'm only going to use five for this specific market research, and this is what I typically  do, okay?  So it's very, very simple, you got your document",

    "pageContent": "open, your market research worksheet open,  and then what I'm going to have you do before we jump in is I'm going to have you go and  go to the Google Chrome store.  If, let me say this, if you're not using Google Chrome, stop what you're doing and go download  Google Chrome.  You shouldn't be using Safari and Firefox and all these things, just trust me on this,  use Google Chrome, it's so much easier.  If you don't know how to download Google Chrome, go YouTube it, go Google it, you literally  could type in Google Chrome download, click download and it will walk you through it,  it is not hard, but if you have any problems, YouTube it, okay?  It's very simple, there's videos on everything, it's amazing and it's free, okay?  Go download Google Chrome and then what I'm going to have you do is inside of Google Chrome,  I'm going to have you type in Google Chrome store.  You're going to go to the Google Chrome store, click on the first link, and I'm going kind  of fast guys because I want to focus on the market research, not on all the little baby  steps here.  This is very simple stuff, Google Chrome web store, you're going to type in SEO Quake,  this is what is called an extension, okay?  It's free, type in SEO as in search engine optimization, Quake as in Quaker Oats, click  on it, click on this one that has the green, SEO Quake, and then it's going to say add  to Chrome, mine says remove because I've already added it, okay?  Click add to Chrome, that's it, and then what's going to happen is you're going to go back  over here, you're going to see this little guy right here, it might not show up in the  top so you might have to click this puzzle piece and underneath it you'll have to click  on this thumb tack and turn it blue, that means it's going to be pinned to the top of  your search bar so it's really easily accessible, I would recommend doing that and then it should  show up like this.  And that is all the setup you need so have your market research worksheet ready, have  your SEO Quake, have your keywords ready, and let's freaking shake and bake baby.  So now what you're going to do is you're going to go to your keyword list and you're going  to take your top five keywords and you're going to start plugging them in with the city  and state, so concrete, Queen Creek, Arizona, concrete contractor, Queen Creek, Arizona,  concrete company, Queen Creek, Arizona, concrete patio, Queen Creek, Arizona, concrete driveway,  Queen Creek, Arizona, and then I always like to throw in a little curve ball and I like  to take the first one, the main term, concrete, Queen Creek, Arizona, I like to take the city,  and I like to switch it and search it, so Queen Creek, concrete, okay, beautiful.  So now we've got five terms to look at and we're going to go and what we're going to  look at now guys, we're going to look at which companies show up in the map section over  and over and over for all of these terms because these are the terms that get the most search  volume guys, realize, like I hope you guys are following along, these terms that we decided  on, these have the most search volume nationwide.  Now we want to see in the specific city we're looking at what companies are showing up for  those terms, those are our competitors and then we want to look at those competitors  and see what kind of work are they",

    "pageContent": "doing, are they competitors because they're good,  are they competitors because there's no one else in the market, that's what we're looking  for is those cities where people are in the top spots by default, not because they're  doing something special, okay, so all we're going to do now is we're going to start looking  at common allies, so I'm going to start off with Bowman, Bowman shows up for number one,  Bowman shows up for number two, Bowman shows up for number three, Bowman shows up not for  number four, shows up not for number five, shows up for number six, so four out of six  I'm choosing Bowman and so what you're going to do is you're going to right click or you're  going to push command if you're on a Mac, you're going to open their website, you're  going to copy and paste this sucker over here into this sheet, so you're going to put it  once under the citations, once under the backlinks, once under the content, once under the domain,  let me explain this, the reason we are doing specifically looking at the citations which  I'm going to explain, the backlinks I'm going to explain, the content I'm going to explain  and the age of domain I'm going to explain is because these are the main factors when  it comes to ranking a website organically and in the maps and so those are the things  we want to look at, we don't care what their logo looks like, we don't care how much they  have, how many, I don't know, customer testimonials, those things don't affect ranking, we care  about how old is their domain, how much content do they have on their website, how many backlinks  they have and how many citations, I'm going to show you how to find all of them and what  they mean, how we can interpret them but for the sake of this what I want you to do is  go and find the next three companies that would fit inside of here that show up for  the majority, so if you have six terms that you're searching, one, two, three, four, five,  six, I want to know the company that shows up at least four out of six times, minimum.  Now if you start seeing and there's not any commonalities and there's different companies  every single time, that's actually a good thing, that means there's no steady, like  somebody that Google can rely on and so don't stress it, if you can't find anyone that shows  up for four out of six, find someone that shows up for three out of six and just don't  overthink it.  Another thing I want to point out is when you see the following which I have found,  this is my favorite thing, this is why I'm talking a little fast, getting a little excited  but when you see what I'm about to show you, you have found some freaking gold my friends  and what that is is you have a company like this, Copper Star Concrete LLC dash Steve  Wood, shout out to Steve, okay, you got Steve over here, homeboy does not have a website,  no website, it's 2022, he's ranking number one, question is does he rank for every single  search term or at least the majority, if he does, we have found some freaking gold baby.  Okay, so let's go to the first one, there's Steve, one out of one, there's not Steve,  so one for two, oh no, no there's Steve, two for two, there's Steve, three for three, Steve's  four for six, Steve made the cut guys, Steve's five for six, the only one Steve does not  rank for is the last",

This is not something that I googled this is not something that was a swipe this is  not something that somebody gave me.  This right here that I hold in my hands is the product of me knocking thousands not hundreds  not tens thousands of doors door to door to door making thousands of prospecting calls  doing at this point I probably haven't made a thousand zoom closes at this point but we're  going to be there soon.  A lot okay this comes from experience this is not something that somebody gave me okay  so I want to tell you when I give you something I make sure it works first and I make sure  it works thousands of times so what I did is I took my knowledge of knocking on door  after door after door after making prospecting call after prospecting call after prospecting  call what worked what didn't work I put it into a document and that is the perfect the  perfect prospecting script okay so I want to give you the breakdown really quick it's  a really really simple I want to give you the outline of what it is then we're going  to jump into each individual step and I'm going to give you an actual example okay so  it's a really really easy process okay this this script is a really really easy four step  process with one at the end I guess you could consider a step but I want to go over those  steps really really quickly okay so here's what it is is we're going to it's four things  made up of four things number one is who you are and it's a pattern interrupt okay so these  are things that are going to happen during the prospecting script okay during the hook  who you are slash pattern interrupt and I'm going to explain this okay number two is what  you're doing why you're calling guys you need to give them a damn good reason why you're calling  okay you need to give them a damn good reason why you're calling them and interrupting their  day step three the deal what's in it for you and what's in it for them okay meaning what's  the win-win and by the way most people most salespeople to get this wrong and they focus  so much on what's in it for them hey you get this you get this you get this and they forget to tell  the business owner hey just so you know I'm gonna make money and a lot of it okay they're so scared  to do that and they forget to tell the business owner that the only thing the business owner is  thinking is what's the catch they like it they're in they're interested but they're thinking there's  got to be a catch there's got to be a catch he keeps telling me good good good good good what's  what's his motive okay so don't forget this part so what the deal so step three what is the deal  okay what's in it for them and what's in it for you and I would say it's more important to focus  on what's in it for you because they can clearly see what's in it for them step four is transition  and one thing that's going to really really help you guys in these calls specifically the the hook  process is your transitions okay there's times to pause there's times not to pause and we're  gonna work a lot on our transitions and once we deliver our pitch how we can seamlessly transition  okay so when I was doing door-to-door sales we would deliver the pitch and our transition had  to be fire if we didn't transition well slam door okay same exact thing you guys don't transition  well",

    "pageContent": " Guys, welcome to module three, content is king.  And before we get going, I just want to talk about why content is the way that we win.  This is how we win is through content, okay?  And if you guys remember back to one of the videos I covered in module one of the technical  training, a part two of this whole digital landlords program, is content is one of the  big three things.  Content is one of the pieces of the 80-20 rule.  You can do a lot of things wrong, and if you do a couple of them right, you're going to  win.  And so the reason why content is so important, as I mentioned, if you think about it, Google  does not have millions of people that are just looking at websites and getting together  and saying, this one should rank, this one shouldn't, this one should, this one shouldn't.  They have an algorithm and they have bots that crawl, they crawl the websites.  And these bots, they can't see, they can read text.  And so it's interesting, people, like if you think about it, the only way Google can know  what your website is about is by what is on your website, what kind of text is on your  website.  And you go look at most of these websites for Tony, the tree care guy, or Jack, the  concrete guy, and they don't have any content.  They have 20 words, 30 words, 40 words, they don't know that it's important.  And on top of that, they don't want to do it because writing content is hard.  Writing content actually takes work.  Writing content requires you to use your head.  So the number one thing is why it's important and why this is how we're going to win is  because it is one of the big three things that matter with ranking.  That's number one.  Number two, other companies, other, especially these local business owners, they're not willing  to do it and they're not doing it.  If you guys have done your due diligence properly, going all the way back to looking for layups  in part one of Digital Landlords, you will notice that the people that you're competing  against are not big national companies.  These are little teeny mom and pop shops.  They probably went to GoDaddy, set up a little website, or went to WIC, set up a little website,  or paid their needs so that if you set up a little website, these guys are not going  to be hard to beat, but we have to beat them with content because if they have an old domain,  we can't beat that.  We can't fight it.  We can't fake our domain size or our domain age, sorry.  So content is super, super important because of those facts.  So guys, this is super important.  Instead of just moaning and groaning and saying, oh my gosh, I got to write the content, look  at it as this is how we're going to win.  And if we can get good at content, if we can get obsessed with content and getting good  at it and good enough that then we can outsource it and we can have our outsourcers and our  team and our virtual assistants write our content for us, this is how we're going to  win.  If we do the content correctly, we can avoid a lot of other stuff.  We can rank much more quickly.  We can avoid doing a lot of backlinks.  We can avoid a lot of things, okay?  And it's just like if you use the example of Kobe Bryant, right, I always talk about  Kobe.  Kobe was obsessed with the little",

    "pageContent": " So guys, let's talk about the zoom clothes really quick and when to schedule it said  I want to I want to reiterate and you know spring this up again.  I've talked about this already.  It's not when to actually do the clothes is going to be more of a gut feeling than it  is an exact science.  Okay.  It's not you know necessarily after X amount of leads on this day and blah blah blah.  It's not like that.  Okay.  It's you're going to feel it.  You're going to know the customer is going to start saying things.  They're going to start acting a certain way and you're just going to feel hey it's time  to go and when the iron is hot it's time to strike.  Okay.  And sometimes it's going to be inconvenient.  Sometimes you're going to be leaving for Cancun tomorrow at nine in the morning and you're  going to need to wake up early to do the call close the deal and get to the airport on time  and it sucks.  Okay.  But you know what it feels that flight is a lot better when I've made money than when  I have it.  So I deal with it.  Okay.  That's number one.  The other thing I want to bring this up here is we want to make sure to send the screencast  the night before.  Want to give them at least 24 hours to watch this screencast.  Okay.  So let's say for example that tomorrow was because today is actually Wednesday.  Let's say tomorrow's Thursday.  We're supposed to do the call tomorrow at noon.  Okay.  I would want to make sure that my screencast was made and sent within at least 24 hours  before and I would send them have it attached to a software that tracks it and I would want  to give them 24 hours to watch this video but I would want to schedule it you know for  tomorrow at noon and I would want to send it before 24 hours before.  Okay.  Very very simple.  The other thing I want to mention is make sure that's actually kind of a bad example  because I like to make sure and schedule my zoom closes either first thing in the morning  or in the evening.  Okay.  Morning is always better but I'm talking their morning.  So I'm you know mountain time if I'm doing someone in the eastern time I'm doing these  calls early and the reason why is guys when you set appointments for their lunch break  life happens man business happens employee problems and I got hung up on a job and blah  and then they're just like do I really want to deal with this do I really want to take  time out of my day to get pitched but if you do it first thing in the morning and it's  like before they go out to work they're going to they've already agreed to it.  That's a different story.  Okay.  On top of that when you do it in the middle of the day.  What are they going to actually what are going to carry their laptop and catch you in the  parking lot of a 7-eleven.  You know what I mean.  But at night or in the morning they're at their house they're at least on their laptop  or even if it's their phone but they're sitting down and they're able to focus.  Another great time to schedule these on Saturdays okay.  For me personally Saturdays are a day that I work on my business not in my business and  so for some of these business owners that's exactly what they do Saturday they don't got  employees they don't have Saturdays they don't have employees calling them ringing  them up customers aren't calling them as much.  So Saturdays",

    "pageContent": "are also a really good time to schedule these last few things I want to mention  here that are best practices is make sure to let them know like it's a very simple process  some of these people they get really scared when you talk about zoom in a video call and  just let them know say hey we're going to talk tomorrow what I'm going to do is I'm  going to send you an email it's going to have a link and all you're going to do is it's  really simple Mr. Business Owner you're just going to click on the link and it's going  to take you to a video okay really simple don't stress it and by the way if we have  problems we'll deal with it but it's not as complicated as it sounds so that's number  one is I let them know that and make sure and we'll talk about this in future videos  make sure that you can see their face and you can hear their voice because if I have  to get on and pitch somebody that won't even show their face how do you think I'm going  to get a credit card from somebody that won't even show their face okay.  So these are just some of the best practices with setting up the zoom clothes and when  to send the screencast so in recap set up the zoom clothes for morning or night when  they're at home focused make sure they're at a desktop okay make sure that they understand  zoom is going to be very simple it's going to be them clicking on a button make sure  you can see their face make sure you can hear their voice and make sure they've watched  the screencast that you just created that's 10 minutes or less that they've watched that  or sorry at least 24 hours before or you've sent that sent it to them 24 hours before  and they have watched the screencast before you get if you don't do this guys you're you're  every one of these things that you don't do you can still close deals and you probably  will still close deals by skipping steps but the more of these things that you do the closer  to this process the higher the chance of you actually getting the deal",

Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh  Oh my gosh, stop turn off the video and wait a little longer  Okay, but if it's been ten days or let's say say eight to ten days and nothing's happening. You're not getting any leads then  Yeah, we let's dig in let's figure out what's going on  So the first thing that we want to do is we got to figure out we got to diagnose the problem  Okay, we're gonna figure out what is it that we're not getting? Okay, obviously, we're not getting leads  But let's go back a little bit further. Let's see if it's deeper than that. Are we not getting leads? Okay, great  So but are we getting clicks?  Okay, so we're getting clicks but not leads so we can kind of look there. Are we getting impressions?  Okay, so we're getting impressions, but not clicks  So maybe it's there, you know, and we just start digging in layer by layer by layer  But here is the key and this is very similar to when you're not closing deals  You always want to look at the step or steps prior because that's where the issue is  Okay, and so here's what you need to look at  Okay  If you are not getting and let me see if I can say this correctly if I if I don't say it correctly  I will resay it and I'll tell you but I might mess this up  Okay, but it just just hear me out. So if you are not getting leads  But you're getting clicks. It's usually an issue with your landing page because think about it. People are clicking on your ads  They're going to your page, but you're not converting them into calls. So it's usually a landing page issue. Okay now if you are getting  impressions  But you're not getting clicks  It's usually an issue with your ad, right? Google is showing it to people they're putting it in front of people's faces  That's the impressions but your ad copy is not grabbing them. And so that's why they're not  Clicking on it. Okay, and so you just need to figure out like what is the issue?  Because ultimately if we're not getting phone calls that is that's a problem  That's that's what we need to figure out  We want to go deeper and want to figure out what part of this we're actually  Making a mistake. Okay, so that's number one is we're gonna diagnose where the issue is step two after you've diagnosed  What part? Okay. Well, I'm getting impressions, but I'm not getting clicks or I'm getting clicks  But I'm not getting calls  What I want you to do is I want you to go and watch  The video prior the video prior to this or the two prior to this or whatever video you need to watch that talks about  That specific topic. So if you're having an issue with  The landing page because you're getting clicks, but you're not getting calls  You're gonna want to go and watch the module that talks about  That building the landing page you're gonna talk. It's called money love speed  That's the module you're gonna want to watch the infamous one pager  Okay, if you're having a problem with some other area go watch that video  So I want you to go and watch that video  Whatever one it is and figure out is it something that you skipped whether on accident or on purpose because most often what I found  Is that it's not because what we trained isn't working  It's because you did something",

It's not highlighted and so no one's clicking on it. Maybe you didn't put the form  Maybe the four like there's so many different variables  I want you to go and rewatch that specific video that pertains to that step or covers that step and make sure you're doing it  Exactly how it's trained in that video  Okay, because until you do that we're not gonna be able to know and I'm telling you most often 99% of the time  You're gonna figure out what you're doing wrong. You're gonna go. Let's say let's say you're getting impressions, but you're not getting clicks  You're gonna go look at your ad copy and you're gonna go. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. I put I spelled the city wrong  I put Queen Creek and I spelled it. I spelled Creek wrong  I added an E and people are seeing it and they like oh my gosh, who's this incompetent business, right?  So go first of all step one diagnosed step two go watch the video  That talks about and trains on the part that you're messing up. Okay based on your diagnosis step three  I'm gonna ask you to go into the Facebook community and  Search the group okay  I'm gonna have you search the group and look for conversations related to what you're having an issue with  So if you're having an issue with your landing page  I want you to go into this search bar at the very top corner a little magnifying glass and type click on it and type  landing page one pager  Whatever  Weebly site or any keyword that you think people would type in when they're referring to  The page that we eventually throw away the landing page that we use and then we eventually throw away and I want you to search for  conversations around that and the reason I'm gonna direct you here instead of immediately just reaching out to fix it Felix or reaching  Out to me or reaching out to somebody else is because guys I'm trying to turn you into entrepreneurs  I'm trying to see how many millionaires I can create in this group and you just messaging me and me spoon-feeding you the answer  First of all, it's not it doesn't work like mathematically. I don't have the time but number two. It's not teaching you anything  Okay, I want you to be a problem solver. I want you to be able to go. Okay  I diagnosed the issue. I  Went and watched the video and now I'm gonna go search the group and search these conversations to see that see if I can figure  It out on my own because what happens when you have this problem? It's 2 a.m. In the morning and everybody's asleep  Okay, all right. You don't have the option to reach out to people  Okay, I want you to be a problem solver. And so I'm first after you've diagnosed it after you've watched the video  I want you to go and I want you to search the group and look for threads look for  Conversations about the thing that you're struggling with whether it's the ad copy whether it's the one pager whether it's  Setting up the ad properly get a location or whatever  You've diagnosed as the issue number four the fourth thing that I want you to do is if you go in and you've done all  These things you've diagnosed it. You've watched the video. You've searched the group.",

Okay, you're free to tag me as well  I'm just gonna be honest. I'll get to it as fast as I can but I am trying my best to use my time the best  The best to benefit everybody. Okay, so tagging fix that Felix is gonna be your best option  But go and make a post and be very thorough be very specific about it and ask people for help say hey  Here's what's going on. I've done this this isn't this and I still can't figure it out  Is there anybody that can help me and maybe what you can do is you can look and go?  There's some of those threads some of those comments I looked at that was Jeff, you know Jeff was having that issue  So maybe you go and you can tag Jeff, you know, yeah after you post it at Jeff  Hey Jeff, I noticed you were having some similar issues. You have any insight on this  Use your head and go and post. I'm telling you if you do those four steps and  You again, this is I just should even go without saying but I'm gonna say it make sure that this isn't you just completely didn't skip  Module one where I said don't go into these niches look out for this, you know, look out for that, etc  Then you are going to figure this out some other things to take into account and they're easier to forget during the summer  Which it's summer right now and I'm filming this in the winter. It's really easy is I also want you to think about the winter  I want you to think about the the the weather right now  I know in Australia and some other places winter is different different time of the year  But think about it, right use your head go look at the forecast  You're running concrete ads and it's December and and you're in Minneapolis  Okay, first of all, you should probably shouldn't be in Minneapolis  But let's say you are let's say for some weird reason that the due diligence works and it's a low-hanging fruit layup  Guys who's searching for concrete who's even thinking about putting in concrete during Christmas?  Nobody wants to go spend money on concrete during Christmas  That's something you spend for most homeowners after they get their tax returns back when it's spring cleanup when people are getting back into  Backyards and cleaning up the yard and do all those things use your head go look at the last 10 days weather  Could that be affecting it? Is there a hurt? Are you in Florida and there's a damn hurricane? Okay  Are you in Arkansas and there has been a tornado look at these different factors and also this is something to consider  And I guess I I almost skip over this because it just makes sense in my head  But don't look okay  If this was in your city is there something that's happening in your city that there's probably not that many people searching that weekend  Is it the Ironman that weekend go and use your head and look at those things?  But if you use your head you've done the the the module one correctly you've picked the perfect niche  You've you've found a layup and you've done those four things guys. We're gonna figure this out  I promise you there's always a solution and we will figure this out  That's it",

Before you actually get started and start the modules  and start picking niches and start going through everything  and go, go, go, go, and I know you're anxious,  I know you're excited, that's why we came here.  That's why we are here.  I want you to figure out a couple of things, okay?  And I need you to figure out what is the destination?  Where do you wanna go, okay?  So when I say where do you wanna go,  I mean how much money do you wanna make, okay?  How much money do you wanna make within 12 months?  Where do you wanna be by December 31st of this year?  Where do you wanna be 12 months from now?  Whatever that goal is, I wanna know where do you wanna be,  AKA how much money do you wanna make, by what date?  That's the first thing, okay?  And you need to get really clear  on how much money you wanna make.  You need to know the destination.  So let's just say you're sitting in the Midwest, okay?  Maybe you're in Arkansas, maybe you're in Iowa,  I don't know, whatever is classified as Midwest.  And you wanna go to LA, okay?  If you wanna go to LA, there's a lot of ways to go to LA.  You could fly up to Portland and go down, you could fly.  I mean, you could fly, first of all, you could drive,  you could scooter, you could walk.  There's a lot of different methods to get there,  but there's also a lot of different ways.  There's a lot of different routes.  You could go down, go to Phoenix, right?  There's a lot of ways, right?  But guess what?  There's one way that's the fastest.  And so what I need you to do is, first of all,  we gotta know the destination.  We gotta know what you're aiming for,  because if you don't know you wanna go to LA,  you're gonna wander, okay?  So I need you to know how much money do I wanna make  and by what date?  And it needs to be by a specific date.  So we need to figure out what that is,  and then we need to have a plan  for how we're gonna get there.  Meaning, okay, if I wanna get to $10,000 in six months,  how many deals am I gonna need to do at what price per,  like how much am I gonna need to charge the client  at what profit margin?  How am I gonna get to $10,000?  Is it $10,000 profit?  Is it $10,000 gross?  I need you guys to figure out  and get clear about what you want, okay?  And so if you haven't already,  I need you to go watch the video titled Exhausted,  but Satisfied, and we will definitely,  it will be linked somewhere around this video.  I need you to watch this video,  and I need you to set your destination,  put a time on when you wanna get there,  and then I need you to create a plan,  AKA a map, for how you're gonna get there.  And I want you to be so clear  that if I were to come and scare you in the middle of night  and shake you and say, hey, hey,  what do you need to do today  to get to your goal by Christmas,  or to get to your goal that you set  on December 31st, New Year's Eve?  What do you need to do today? ",

Three of them are under $5, but then you get one that's  like $10. What is your thoughts? Do you still go into that or do you? If it's your first deal, no.  Okay, first deal? If it's your first deal, no. If it's your first, second, third deal,  no. You want to follow it exactly. Even if there's one keyword that's creeping above,  you're still going to run into problems. Now, why does it change if it's your third, fourth,  fifth deal? Because now let's say it's your sixth deal, Porter, you know that, hey,  in order for this to work, the CPC on that one keyword is double. I'm going to have to charge  a minimum of like $2,000 to make the numbers work, right? But when it's your first deal,  sometimes getting that $2,000 deal is a huge obstacle because you're like not used to asking  for $2,000. Okay? So no, I'm saying stick to it exactly on your first few deals,  and that's where you're going to find the goal. Cool.",

    "pageContent": " Beautiful, all right, Ryan Dalton.  So guys, real quick before we get into this call, which by the way, we're gonna be talking  about 2025.  We're gonna be talking about how to, I called this stream, this live is how to gear up for  the best year of your life.  And I wanted to have, you know, I mean, arguably, not arguably, I think hands down out of anybody  in this, not even, I think, I know, hands down without a doubt, 2024 was your year,  man.  Yeah, 2024 was a great year.  Yeah, I mean, 2023 had a great year, but 2024, you did some incredible things, which we're  gonna get into.  But real quick, I just wanted to make one quick announcement.  By the way, Jahil, what's going on?  One quick announcement, guys, is we talked about this, I kind of alluded to this, I think  it was last week, but we are constantly, you know, listening to feedback from you guys  on Rankin' Ren Engine as you guys, if any of you guys have no idea what we're talking  about, rankinrenengine.com, that's the only tool you need for this business.  We listen to the feedback.  My team gives it to Ryan, and I know that you guys are giving it and we're listening.  Obviously, there's people in other countries that those are things that we're gonna be  rolling out.  But one of the, I think, only things that was left on the tool was the backlinking piece.  And the nice part is it still, you know, when you do the due diligence on Rankin' Ren Engine,  you can still see the backlinks, it still gives you data.  When Ryan and I discussed, I'm like, if we could go a little deeper to have something  similar to like a man ghouls, where we could not just see the backlinks so we could look  at the backlink profile, see the referring domains, I think this thing would be the most  complete tool out there for Rankin' Ren.  So Ryan, can you give us some kind of update in terms of that, I know you told me, but  just for everybody else, when we can expect kind of that rollout, a conservative estimate  on when we can expect that feature to be added?  Yeah, for sure.  Yeah, so I think in the next conservatively, in the next 30 days, we got the holidays coming  up.  So that's gonna make things a little bit slower than normal.  But all the data is there, actually.  So we have all the data to create that.  Right now, we're just making everything look real pretty on the front end so that when  you actually use that part of the tool, it looks pretty, which I'm a big believer in.  So we'll have that rollout pretty soon.  And people want to be able to do copycat backlinks and know where they're comparing backlinks  and all that.  So that's an easy addition.  Beautiful.  And by the way, there's going to be a few people because I do see some people that have  joined in the last week, copycat backlinking.  Well, let me just even go a little bit deeper and go very basic.  Backlinking is, I would call it, kind of like a steroid to get your website ranked.  If, you know, there are times when you don't have to backlink.  If you go into a very, very easy city and niche, you do really good content, you do  everything else very sound, I",

    "pageContent": "have ranked websites without any backlinks.  But when your website gets stuck on page two, bottom of page one, or you just want to speed  things up, backlinking is a steroid.  It is a way to get the website kind of out of that rut and get it to the top of page  one.  But essentially, maybe, I know this is very basic for some people, but maybe, Ryan, in  30 seconds, for those that there's a few people I know that are brand new to online, to SEO,  what is backlinking?  Just so everybody knows what the heck we're talking about.  It's not that complicated, but it sounds complicated.  Yeah, a backlink is any time that your website is referenced somewhere else on the internet,  basically, and Google will rank based on what they call their EAT, acronym, expertise,  authoritativeness, and trustliness.  And one of the things they look for is all these different signals to see if your website  meets their standard for ranking, right?  Ultimately, they're trying to decide, is the website, are the websites that they're returning  the search results answering the searcher's question?  And the websites that have the highest expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness  are going to answer the question better than ones that don't.  So to find that, they look at all these different signals.  And one of the key ones, one of the most important ones is backlinks, which are basically  just a popular contest.  It's other websites saying your website answers those questions about whatever that is, like  a keyword, like concrete contractor, right?  Other websites are talking about you as the concrete contractor and pointing to your URL  from their website.  That signals to Google, hey, this guy probably knows what he's doing with concrete.  And then you rank higher than your competitors.  That's it.  Remember that, guys, the popularity contest.  It's just like, I always think about like high school or your friends or whatever.  It's like who you hang around is who people assume you are, right?  So the way that you hang around people on the internet is people refer to you.  People send you a backlink.  And so, for example, let's just say, and it's kind of like a status thing, like Forbes.  Forbes would have more status than any mommy blog or construction blog or whatever.  So if Forbes gave me a backlink, they're telling Google, hey, Google, I have a lot  of status.  And this website, BentonvilleConcrete.com, I'm basically giving them my approval.  And so then Google's looking at it going, OK, well, if Forbes says that, then they must  have some status.  And so it's basically this game of just getting people to link to you.  And there are strategies.  But one of the most common is called the copycat method.  All it is is looking at other people that are winning, other people that are ranking,  finding where they're getting backlinks, and just going and copycatting and doing the exact  same.  And so what we're saying to wrap all this up is this tool is going to allow you to go  find those links and to be able to go and harvest them yourself.  So it sounds like a lot.  When I first got started, again, let's remember, I didn't know how to build a website.  I didn't know what a domain was.  And here we are talking about backlinks.  It's not that complicated.  So Gina says, I've been on a mission to figure out and set up backlinks for our sites.  I'm still trying to figure it",

    "pageContent": "out.  Yeah, it's really not that difficult.  So what we'll do, maybe when we roll that feature out officially, we'll go and do a  backlink training, just some basic one-on-one how to do backlinks.  But yeah, guys, if you haven't already, you can use any tool you want.  I know when I started, I was using a combination of seven different tools.  I had all kinds of different stuff that we had opened up.  I had even had a custom software built to track my paper lead stuff when I was doing  that, which I don't recommend.  But if you want to make it easy, go to RankinRentEngine.com, sign up for an account.  It's ridiculously affordable.  And we also have a code that...  Ryan, for anybody that hasn't already, let's just write that code in the chat real quick.  That's the one.  And that's 20% off for the first two months.  Yeah, I think I've got a bunch of codes.  I think that's the one that has that one.  So I can confirm that after the call.  But yeah, I think it's 20% off for two months.  Beautiful.  So guys, go check it out.  It's the only tool that we're using.  It makes due diligence so much faster.  Anyway, there's a million different things.  That's not what this call is about.  But just wanted to give a quick little plug for that and know that the backlinkings coming out.  So move your stuff over.  You can buy your phone.  How much are your phone numbers through RankinRentEngine?  Yeah, it depends on how you do it.  So you could get additional, add additional sites.  And if you add additional sites, the number comes free with it.  Otherwise, they're $2.50 a month.  Which is half the price.  $2.50, right?  Yeah.  And I think on CallRail, even if you do...  Even me, I've got a bunch of numbers because I'm moving my stuff over still.  I think the cheapest I ever got them was like five bucks a number.  I could be wrong.  But that's very, very cheap.  One of the things I realized about some of these other platforms is that they're  like, they've got like different tiers that are kind of confusing versus like your  programmable voice is add-on, your CRM is add-on.  Look at some of these other competitors.  And it just signals to me that it's just not made for RankinRent.  It's made for like different marketing strategies or tools or whatever you're trying to do.  But for RankinRent, it needs to be just pretty straightforward.  Like you have to have programmable voice and messaging.  So it's baked right in.  Yep, yep.  No, it's slick, man.  It's super simple.  So, okay, guys, that said, real quick, Jahil says, Ryan, quick question.  I don't know if this is already in the works, but if it's possible,  will there be a tracker in Rare that shows how many keywords someone here,  someone has remaining for the day?  Kind of similar to Mangools.  Let me shut my door.  Totally.  Yeah.  So that exists now.  So if in the top right, you click on your profile and then you click on the usage tab,  you can see daily keyword lookups remaining.  And so your plan will determine how many that number is.  But you can go in there and you can see for today how many lookups remain.",

But you can look at all your usage statuses under your profile on the usage tab.  There you go.  Hopefully that answered your question, Mr. Jahil.  So let's get into this call, guys.  It's December 17th.  We have literally like two weeks to the day, like two weeks in a day, right?  Yeah.  It's almost over, man.  Quarter four is almost done.  That's crazy.  I say this every year, dude.  But it's like it feels like I just set my goals for 2024.  Yeah.  And here we freaking are.  Okay.  So let's talk about it, dude.  I want to...  So in 2024, Ryan, where were you at when 2024 started in terms of revenue?  I will tell you right now.  So January is a little bit weird because I did like trial or like discount rates for people,  like in some areas in the winter.  But I started...  Yeah.  So I came in at 2024 around $37,000 a month.  Okay.  Yeah.  $38,000.  I'm looking at my spreadsheet right now.  $38,000 at the start of 2024.  Okay.  $37,000, $38,000 started 2024.  And so, guys, let's keep in mind, Ryan, still...  Up until, was it like a week and a half or two weeks ago, you had a full-time job?  Still do.  Through the 31st or the 50th year.  I'm still got it.  I'm done.  Yeah.  He's done after this.  Two more weeks, but he's done.  So he has a full-time job, which I still can't comprehend.  He's got kids.  He's got a wife.  And he also does jujitsu.  He's got a dog.  He throws parties at his house.  Not ragers, but like he brings his friends over.  Like he has a million things going on, right?  I'm sure you have a Christmas party because I know you do a 4th of July party.  Yeah.  So my friend group has, like everyone kind of does one of the parties.  Mine are the summer ones.  I've got Memorial Day, July 4th, and Labor Day.  So they're the best ones.  They're the best ones.  Let's be honest.  Yeah, for sure.  So, okay, so let's just think about this.  So in the last 11 and a half months, you've added $50,000 of revenue per month, right?  So you're around, what are you at, 87, 88?  Yeah, I'm at when I've got a couple of people, their own discount rates,  but when they come off of those, I'll be at 89.5.  Okay.  I'm just, you just gave me a thought.  So I want to write it down.  89.5.  So I added $50,000 of revenue while having a full-time job.  And the most impressive part is on top of that, you also built rank and run engine.  Yeah.  Which, of course, he hired developers, but he was very tightly project managing that entire thing.  And so as I sat here and I'm thinking about New Year's, or the New Year,  I'm thinking about 2025.",

I'm like, what better person to have on than the person that had the best year out of anybody,  not only in my group, but in the free group, not only in this group, but in the free group,  but of, I would say any of the people that I know.  So I want to talk about that, dude.  I want to know, let's reverse engineer.  What did you do that made such a difference from the year before,  which you had a phenomenal year the year before?  And guys, for those that are new, like some of you guys that are, reach your first call.  Ryan, two, was it about two years ago?  When did you start this?  I'm going into my third year.  That's crazy.  Two years ago, I didn't know what this was.  Yeah, so 2022 February was the first time that I turned on a Google ad.  I'm not crazy.  It's wild.  And it's inspiring because that's the possibilities of what's possible.  So two years ago, he didn't even know what this was.  Now he's at $87,000, $89,000 a month, built a tool that's phenomenal for this space.  I think it's the best tool out there already.  It's going to be hands down the best tool once he had a few more features  and done all this while having a family, while having a job.  And I just want to know, dude.  So I basically with this, I just want to, what did you do?  How did you start the year?  How did you gear up for 2025?  What was your mindset?  What was your planning?  What was your, did you get rid of a bunch of unnecessary things?  How did you manage all of this?  So I mean, that was like five questions, but we could start with one of them.  So let's get down.  I love the mindset stuff, man.  Like the mindset, I know some people think it's cheesy and they're like,  oh, I'll talk about mindset again.  But I am a, I'm just a huge believer in this business model.  And it doesn't, I was telling my wife this other day, it doesn't feel like work to me.  Like that's, I think one of the biggest differences, like people like, oh, like,  you know, you're up at nine o'clock at night, like working on something.  It doesn't feel like work.  It feels like play to me.  Like when I'm figuring out how to grow, how to expand, how to do the next thing,  it doesn't feel like work.  And I have like pretty good work-life balance.  So I'm not always trying to like, you know, be in front of a computer,  but when I am in front of a computer, it feels like something I really enjoy.  And the other part of it is, is that I think the AI is going to change our future  quite drastically.  And I think that the trades, the services that we help enable  through the lead that we provide are not going anywhere.  And my guess is they're probably going to be the last to be impacted.  Like, how are you going to have a robot put in a concrete driveway?  You know what I'm saying?  So like, I am thinking way forward because I work in tech, you know,  I've worked in tech for years and I know that there's a lot of jobs  that are just like all coming on the chopping block.  But I don't think that the trades are",

No, or a concrete guy, or none of the trades, the roofer or whatever,  are going to be, I think, in the near term impacted by AI.  And so I'm trying to align myself and my company and my finances  and my vision for things that are enduring and lead generation for tradespeople  is, I think, a really, really safe, safe move.  And so I want to grow a business that is future proofed.  Yeah.  So, and that's one of the things when I started this business,  there was a lot of different factors that were, you know, important to me,  scalability, recurring, all those different things.  But I didn't even really consider that piece or the piece that  this is a pretty recession resistant industry, right?  Obviously, we've all probably talked to our business owners,  like I had a business owner during the elections,  and right before that, he kind of got a little shaky on me.  I don't know if people are still buying, and by the way, he's still with us.  Now that the elections are over, I think it was all in his head.  Now he's like, people are finally starting to buy again.  Maybe not, but he's good now.  But outside of that, dude, we really didn't have,  like I don't think we had any cancellations, nothing that was directly tied to that.  But I didn't think about the fact that this is very recession resistant,  a business, a very recession resistant business.  And I've also a very, it has a lot of longevity because it's just a very,  guys, I think you probably realize this too, Ryan,  but like the more I'm in business and just in life in general,  the more I'm attracted to stuff that's simple, right?  Simple scales, simple is sexy.  It's like all these complex things I don't want anything to do with.  And this is such a simple business model that it just makes sense.  So going back to the mindset stuff, is there anything that you can give us?  Like, what do you do?  How did you prepare and how did that have to do with your year in 2024?  And what advice would you give anyone that's on this call  for how to get their mind right going into 2025?  Yeah, so I agree with you about the simple stuff.  I just, I got the chat over here on the left.  I think Tim asked a question about AI chat bots.  And this kind of goes with my answer to this question is that  I think that there are a lot of ways to try to improve your agency  that feel like you're improving your agency, but you're just getting distracted.  So what I try to avoid is things that are going to become a problem at scale.  And so that means, you know, like if there's some plugin that looks cool,  or if there's some AI chat bot, or if there's, you know,  whatever there is the thing that people are testing out  and kind of the SEO world or whatever.  Generally, I found those are distractions is that rarely do I find something  that is so valuable, I will bake it into my agency from the top to bottom.  And I will, if I'm not careful, I'm prone to this.  I'm super prone to this.  I will catch myself testing lots of different little things that are just time sucks,  that are creating complexity in my agency instead of simplicity.  Like",

It's reducing it in some areas, whether that's, you know,  automations or like tying things together with like the finance stuff on the back end  or those kinds of things, making it simpler rather than more complex.  And sometimes maybe AI chat bots will actually make it simpler for you  because you're able to get leads to a business owner  in a way that is actually more streamlined, valid.  But I'm always trying to think about how to simplify.  Even at my current run rate, I'm thinking about how to make my agency simpler  and just smoother in its operations.  Yeah. Yeah, and it's also, I feel like when you first start out,  it's always about addition and how, what do I need to add?  What do I need to start doing?  And then you realize it's more about what, it's about subtraction.  What in this next year can I get rid of in my business  and in my processes and my systems in my life  so I can just focus on one single thing?  And so that was a huge thing for me when I had my biggest year in terms of like growth  when 2020 from 8 to 10,000 up to 100,000, that was a year of simplicity.  And it was getting rid of a lot of distractions,  getting rid of a lot of little micro businesses inside the business,  selling the SEO, selling this service, that service, consulting,  focusing on a bunch of different niches,  trying a bunch of different strategies to onboard customers.  And it was just, I was just cutting stuff, cutting stuff, cutting stuff.  And I would just wake up, same thing.  Get a new area, two areas, put up some ads, go do a deal.  And that was it, man.  And that's how I scaled.  And it was so easy.  It wasn't easy.  It was just mentally, I had a lot of clarity.  So for you mindset-wise, are there, are you somebody that does like,  what do you do for that?  Is it reading?  Is it talking to certain people?  Is it listening to certain things?  Like, what do you do to gear up that way?  Yeah, it's, I read a lot.  I got this book.  It's called Blitz Scaling.  Have you read this?  I've never even heard of that book.  It looks interesting.  It's the founder of, the co-founder of LinkedIn.  He's a partner at a firm called Greylock Partners.  Yeah, Greylock's is venture capital, right?  And the tagline is the lightning fast path to building massively valuable companies.  Interesting.  And I was like, I can't read this.  That I got to read that.  So I'm reading it.  Like one of his big ideas is that you have to, well, you don't have to,  but he talks about growing to optimize for speed,  which you talk about all the time over efficiency.  And the idea is, is you'll figure out the efficiency later.  And so my inclination is towards efficiency,  where I want to have everything like buttoned up, like as I grow.  And so it means my growth is kind of like this.  Whereas if you focus on speed, you'll figure out the inefficiencies later on.  You'll figure out like the, which is more your style, right?  Which is more like you'll grow and then like you'll figure out the pieces  that you got to figure out to make it real smooth. ",

Reid Hoffman and Chris Yeh are the co-authors.  Interesting guy. I like that guy.  It's a good read.  So give us three recommended books for mindset going into this year.  And guys, again, also just as for the person that's going to go and be like,  well, I'm going to go read for eight hours today,  because that's what Warren Buffett does.  No, that's just things to read.  I'm sure Ryan probably reads 10 pages to 30 minutes a day.  He probably doesn't sit and read for three hours.  So let's not go too extreme here.  But anyway, give us three recommended books on mindset that have really helped you.  Three books on mindset that helped me.  The three that come to mind are  Humilitas.  The theory behind Humilitas is the big idea with each book.  And you can decide if you're interested.  Humilitas is the idea that one of the missing things for success in life  is the combination of steely grit and humility.  Those two things are like what drives some of the most successful people in the world.  Great book.  Another is Meditations by Marcus Aurelius.  You can see where my shoulder.  See that guy right there?  See the bust of the dude behind me?  Is that Meditations?  Yeah, boy.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah, dude.  That's the good stuff.  You got it on your desk.  All right.  Yeah, man.  Meditations is the big idea.  It's the Stoic principles.  It's a little bit, it's philosophy, but the ideas in it are really good for business.  I went through Y Combinator.  And one of the things that Y Combinator said when they look for a founder  is they want someone who a bomb can go off.  And they just look at it.  And they're like, huh, a bomb went off.  And they go back to solving problems.  Like whatever the problems that bomb caused.  Like the James Bond kind of idea, right?  Meditations is the operating system for the mind, right?  Your brain, like a computer, needs an operating system.  And if you don't have an operating system,  it means that you're just sort of a kind of a mess, right?  So having a deliberately created operating system for your brain  is the purpose of philosophy.  And Meditations is great for business  because there are no shortage of problems in business.  For example, if I've got a business owner  who I'm killing it for, and I'm getting 80 liens a month,  and he calls me and he cancels  because he is getting tons of commercial job  that I helped him get, right?  I helped him get all that commercial work  and now he's not interested in my 80% residential leads, right?  He's canceling on me.  That is completely outside of my control.  I have no control over that.  And so when I get upset about it, no, right?  I shouldn't anyway, right?  It's out of my control.  Why should I get upset about it?  That's one of the big concepts in Meditations  is it teaches your brain to be like,  oh, this problem happened.  Huh, okay, I'm gonna go solve it, right?  It's really good.  And then the third one was  Never Split the Difference by Chris Voss.",

I'm gonna link up this last one  so everyone can have an easy way.  By the way, there is no affiliate here.  I just went to Amazon to type these in.  I wish there was an affiliate for books.  I need a bigger audience to get an affiliate for.  Yeah, yeah, I agree.  It would be nice.  So those are the three that Ryan recommends, guys.  Humilitas, Meditations, and Never Split the Difference.  I've never even heard of the first one.  I've heard of the other two, obviously, but that's awesome.  Okay, so now tell us like, how did you set your,  what was your goal setting that process like about a year ago?  I guess it would have been December 2023  as you're gearing up for 2024.  What was that like, dude?  Yeah, this is an area that I am not very good at actually,  and I need to do it for this year.  I'm really good at committing today to what I need is required  and what will take to move the needle today.  Like that's my strength.  My weakness is I'm not good at setting a goal  and backward planning with key performance indicators.  I do this in my job, or I did in my job.  I don't know why I didn't do it in my agency.  It's weird, like a mental thing.  So I wouldn't say that I sat down in December of last year  and like planned out this year.  The thing that I did in December though,  is I realized I had like pretty significant chunk of time  under my belt of like really knowing  how to do this business model.  And then realizing that going into next year,  I need to be aggressive.  And I invested, I reinvested back into my agency  a significant amount of money  that I could have taken as profit,  that I just dumped back in.  And I attribute a lot of that to my growth.  So when you started the year, you didn't have in mind,  hey, I want to hit this revenue number or anything like that?  No, that's what's easy.  Bad at that kind of thing.  It's an air of opportunity for me for sure.  That's crazy, bro.  So you didn't have any idea,  in the back of your mind, did you say, hey,  like obviously you didn't sit down and write it down,  but in the back of your mind, did you sit down and think,  I want to hit this revenue target?  Well, you had me on a call with two others a while back  and we all joked about who's going to be the first to get to 83.  And I said, I'm going to be the first.  And so I knew in my brain, I never forgot that.  And I was like, I don't know if I was the first.  I don't know if those, I hope both of them did it.  Both those guys are all small.  Both those guys, I hope they both did it.  I have no idea where their agencies are.  But I was like, even if it's not a competition, I'm going to do it.  And so I think in some ways, that was my goal for this year  is to get to the million recurring.  So just for anyone that hasn't been on any of these calls with Ryan.  So Ryan has already made a million dollars.  This has been months ago, total, since he",

    "pageContent": "started.  But now he's on the run rate to make a million dollars per year.  Which again is crazy because you literally just decided  to start researching business models.  And it's not like anything goes wrong with your job.  It's not like you don't like your job.  It's not like you aren't getting paid very well.  You just saw the writing on the wall and you're like, dude,  I don't want to be in a position of someone else controlling my future  or controlling my paycheck.  And so it's crazy, bro.  It's a crazy...  How many months of research did you do before you actually found this model?  About three.  I started in like, probably the end of 2021,  just getting up in the morning and just reading about different business models.  Like I knew I was going to commit to one going into the next year,  where all year, full year, I was going to commit to one and not look back.  And if I failed, I knew I gave it a real shot.  You know what I'm saying?  Like I really gave a real shot at it.  That's the only way that you can know if something works or not.  You can't flirt with it.  You can't try it a little bit.  You got to go for it.  And so I wanted to make sure that the decision I made  about the industry or business model or whatever that I went into  was informed as much by my goals as possible.  And it turned out all right.  Yeah, I'd say it turned out all right, man.  Yeah.  That's insane.  It's exciting even for me.  By the way, Adair said he just closed a business owner just now for $800 a month.  He'll have to watch the replay.  So you got to love that.  Love that.  Got to love that.  That's okay.  Go ahead.  Fires me up.  I love closed deals.  Me too.  I love that because...  And by the way, guys, if you ever have to come down to  getting on this call or doing that, that is what you should be doing.  So if you have to schedule a call, just schedule the call.  Go close the deal.  You can watch the replay.  We do love having you on here if you don't have that going on.  But that's what this business model is about.  And going back to the simplicity thing,  the way you're going to make the most amount of money,  the most amount of progress in 2025, guys,  is by focusing on how can you ask the most amount of people for money.  Absolutely.  As much as you need to learn the basics,  you need to learn the back linking,  you need to learn the content,  you need to learn how to build sites,  you need to focus on how to get business owners to pay you.  That's it.  I learned that from you, man.  That was something that I can hear your voice in my head sometimes  when I think about that.  I think that is just great business advice is  the more that you can ask people for money,  the faster your agency is going to grow.  That's one of the big things I learned in digital landlords is,  and your calls and you talking about that concept,  and my goal became one closing call a week.  I have to have one closing call a week.  If there's not a closing call in a week, I'm upset.  It's not someone else's fault.  It's my fault.  But I have to have a closing call every week.  And",

    "pageContent": "now I'm trying to get to where I want two closing calls per week.  We've had as many as six in a week.  That's an outlier.  That's by far the exception.  But it's based on that principle that I learned in digital landlords is  you just have to be asking people for money  because if you're not, it's a hobby.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And people don't want to hear that.  Especially people in other groups.  Sometimes maybe I'll go and do a call with people in other groups.  And I'll always ask how many people are making money and whatever.  We'll raise our hand.  I'm like, well, the rest of you guys just have a hobby.  And it really makes people uncomfortable.  But it's the truth.  But yeah, I mean, to speak on that really, really quick, guys.  For me, the thing that changed the entire game  is I just sat there and looked at it.  I'm like, look, there's certain things.  By the way, Gabriel Ryan.  Been a minute, bro.  What's up, dude?  Good to have you on.  Gabriel Ryan is in, I think, Nashville, by the way.  Just from my memory.  All right, 2C, baby.  What's up?  Yeah, he was in Oregon, then Vegas, then Nashville.  But anyway, good to see you on, Gabriel.  But yeah, guys, for me, it was just like this idea of  there are certain things in our life we never miss.  We always find a way to sleep.  Whether it's on the airport floor or whether it's in our car.  We always find a way to eat.  We always, well, not always, but typically find a way to shower.  Even if it's like with a baby wipe, you know?  Even if, whatever.  So then I'm like, dude, if I took that exact...  And for me, another thing that wasn't like a necessity,  but I always found myself doing was going and exercising.  And I was like, dude, I'm so dedicated to this.  And that's great.  But like, what if I took this same commitment  where I never miss, I'll wake up at 3 before a vacation  just to make the gym.  Why don't I just take that and turn it  and make it the same with my business and making money?  I said, man, my business, my bank account would sure look a lot more fat.  And that's what I did in 2020.  It was like, if I didn't have a certain amount of closing calls  every single week, I tried to go for one every single day,  which obviously you have to have a lot of things going,  a lot of things moving to get to that point.  But that's it.  It's like, how do we get...  How do we ask somebody for money every single day?  And if we don't, we're not okay.  And that was the whole thing.  And one little hack, I think I shared this...  I can't remember if I shared this on here or on a WhatsApp message.  But guys, a little thing that I did that was so valuable  that helped me so much is in 2020,  I started scheduling a sales call for Saturday morning  at like 6.37 a.m. every single Saturday.  And the reason why I would do it is the business owner,  contrary to what you might think, the business owner actually is...  That's the time they're actually getting stuff done on their business,  not just in their business. ",

    "pageContent": "They're usually undistracted.  The other thing is you don't really feel like going out on Friday night  if you know you got a 7 o'clock Saturday morning.  So it caused me to have a really disciplined schedule.  And then lastly is what a better way to start the weekend,  not partying, not going out and getting drunk,  but waking up at 7 a.m. and putting new money,  injecting new money into your business.  So anyway, that was something that really, really changed everything for me.  It made me have a phenomenal weekend, got me excited for Sunday.  I would give myself the rest of the day and Sunday off apart from the planning.  But that was huge is just focusing on  how do you get somebody to give you money?  How do you ask somebody for money every single day?  And if you could figure that out, you're going to make a lot of money  because it's just a numbers game, you know?  It is. Yeah.  That's one of the major things I learned here in this group  is you just have to be hitting up people for money as much as you possibly can.  And then I realized that means having all the inventory.  You know, got to have things moving on the back end to do that.  100%, man. 100%.  So for some, let's talk about somebody that's just starting out  or maybe somebody that's like starting out, meaning there's no deals.  Starting out, meaning, you know, maybe they've gotten distracted  and they found their way back and they're like, hey, this is my year.  I'm really going to give this year my all.  What should they, what are some recommendations of what were,  you know, some things that they should do or not do  from somebody like yourself that started two years ago  and in two years, for those that are just joining,  has scaled up to $87,000 a month, built a software tool  and is on track to absolutely obliterate those numbers this year.  What's your advice for somebody that's brand new?  And while you're doing that, I have got to turn down my heat.  I'm sweating so bad. Keep going.  Yeah, if you're brand new, I still like watch the posts of digital landlords  and see people that post stuff.  If you're brand new to this business model  and you started in the last 30 to 45 days here in the group  or started doing rank and rank in the last 30, 45 days  and you're running ads and you're getting like okay performance,  but not great performance and you're wondering about lead flow  and things like that.  If you're getting momentum in this time of year, that's awesome, right?  Because it's only going to increase going into the spring.  Going into quarter one is when you're going to see leads go like this.  I've seen this happen every year for the last three years now.  Going into the spring, the leads are going to increase.  And so my word of encouragement is if you are just starting this business model  and you're starting in December, you are going to see more momentum  going into the spring, right?  I've seen people post like, hey, what's up with lead flow, whatever.  It's like, well, you've got to think about the psychology  of the people who are picking up the phone.  So the people who are picking up the phone  and the people who need things done largely in home services  is my guess is what you're still teaching in the course, Nick,  is like largely in these high ticket niches.  And high ticket niches means that",

    "pageContent": "they're going to spend a lot of money.  And they're thinking right now about spending a lot of money  on Christmas presents, on stuff at the end of the year,  that's the psychology of the American consumer  and homeowner and business owner right now.  Now, business owners may be different  because they're trying to get into the end of the year tax break  and they're putting more into their property or whatever.  But the homeowners, which can make up 80 plus percent of your leads on average,  are thinking about their kids' Christmas,  they're thinking about traveling,  they're thinking about all of these things  that are not related to their property.  And then you go into quarter one and the magic happens.  The magic happens when they're getting tax refunds,  they're getting bonuses from the previous year,  there's cash and capital infusion into a market  and we're also past the election year.  And so despite my growth this year,  I think it could have been even higher  if we were not in an election year  because some of that stuff that Nick talked about  with that squirrely business owner like people aren't buying, I don't know.  I got a lot of that this year.  I think that because we're past that,  there's market confidence regardless of your politics.  It doesn't matter what your political beliefs are.  It's just the decision's been made, yeah.  The decision's been made.  It doesn't matter if you're Democrat or Republican,  none of that matters.  What matters is that we have stability  in the sense of there is someone in the office  and there's going to, every time this happens,  happens every four years,  there's capital infusion back into markets  where money was on the sidelines.  So what happens is, and this is maybe more complex,  but I think this is a point worth bringing in,  is that a lot of the purchasing decisions  for people in this industry  are made by homeowners and property owners  who are always kind of the second money  behind big commercial money,  meaning that a lot of this big commercial money  that's in private equity and commercial properties  and all the growth around those kinds of things  will put money into properties and rental properties  and all that commercial money  that comes back into the market  is generally a good signal  for what's going to happen in the residential market.  And all that money is likely,  because it happens every four years,  going to come back in,  and now that we're past the election year,  we're past the holidays,  and I think you can yell at me if you want to,  but I think next year is going to be  one of the biggest years for this industry  because of these factors at play, right?  We're past the election year.  We're going into a brand new 2025.  There's a lot of money that's been on the sidelines  for the last year that we can all start coming back in  and residential markets are going to follow behind that.  And so I think the pump is primed for 2025.  And so if you're in, if you just started  and you're wondering about lead flow,  think about what time of year it is, okay?  And then realize that next year  we're already primed for potentially  one of the best years in this industry in a while.  There's a noticeable difference.  From right now, December 15th to December 31st,  it can be a bit weird.  By the way, don't think you can't close deals.  By the way, Adair just closed the deal.  Oh, I didn't even say this, by",

He almost hit it in like a year ago,  and then he got to nine and then he dropped to six.  Then this year he went up to nine, four,  and he's lost three deals.  Some people don't know this.  He lost three deals in a row.  I think he was skipping steps, a little too excited.  And then yesterday I got this call.  I was actually on a sales call with Kyle,  and I got this call and I called him back.  He's like, dude, I finally hit 10K.  So anyway, shout out to you, Porter.  I know you've been scraping your way to get to 10K.  But where was I going with that?  What were we talking about?  Oh, the new year.  And so anyway, there's still deals right now,  but what you're gonna see is from now  till the January 1st can be a little bit weird  with lead flow, with business owners being like,  yeah, I'm taking the time off, whatever.  But even though the weather is the same,  generally speaking, the whole mindset shifts January 1.  It's like business, because think about it, dude.  The business owners you wanna work with,  they're having these exact same conversations.  What are we gonna do?  What's our projections this year?  What are we gonna accomplish?  And as part of that, they need more leads.  And so it's like January 1st,  everyone all of a sudden is like, okay, this is my year.  I see a night and day difference January 1 in the mentality.  Night and day, dude.  Night and day.  Completely night and day.  And I think that there's a trickle over,  and I think it's like either they're looking for it more  or they do see an increase in calls  and interest from their homeowners.  And sometimes holidays are up.  Now let's get the house fixed up.  Let's get everything tidied up.  We're gonna have an amazing year.  Everyone's in this new, fresh.  It's such a good time of year.  So guys, I know some of my Australian people,  it's very weird right now.  What I would recommend for you guys is  if you don't wanna go run ads or whatever  because you're worried that there's not gonna be a lot of leads,  that's fine.  Then spend the next two weeks  finding your next five to 10 areas.  Go and get familiar with Rank and Run Engine,  the due diligence tool on Rank and Run Engine.  And go knock out, the next two weeks,  go knock out 300 due diligence.  And go have your next 15 areas lined out.  Get your ads ready to go.  And January 1, kick those things on.  I'm speaking for Australia because I've got this little,  by the way, if you're from Australia  and you're targeting Australia,  send me a message.  I've got a group chat specifically for Australia  that I'm kind of trying to learn  some of the more nuanced stuff there  that I can add you to.  But a lot of people there have told me  it's a bit weird right now.  But January 1st, everything changes.  So if you're feeling a little weird  or you just joined whatever,  you could still get deals.  But just know everything's about to change January 1st.  So you got two weeks to",

I agree.  I'm gonna use the word night and day difference.  And I couldn't agree more.  It truly is night and day.  Some of these business owners  are already thinking about January,  but they're not actually doing anything yet.  They're waiting to get past the holidays.  January hits and they're thinking like,  how do I grow my business this year more than last year?  And then when you show up as the guy or girl,  it's like, hey, I've got something to take you  to the next level.  They'll listen.  I'm also, I've got, we've had two closing calls this week.  We've got another one tonight at five o'clock.  You can close deals in December.  There's still deals happening in December.  What I'm getting at is if you feel like things are,  the momentum isn't quite where you want it.  It's common is all I'm saying, right?  That momentum is a different speed going into quarter one.  One thing I would recommend to you guys,  I know some of you that just joined,  you guys probably just went through this,  but for anybody that's like,  that doesn't know where to start or kind of,  you know, what should I do?  I definitely think it would be worth you guys  go and check out the video that we did  that you guys are supposed to watch  when you first joined called Exhausted But Satisfied.  Watch that video, set your targets for 2025.  And again, this isn't just financial targets.  This could be any target.  And then reverse engineer and break it up by quarter  and by month and figure out exactly that your roadmap  for how to get to that goal.  And you're gonna realize as you do this,  that the map to get to any goal is really not that difficult.  It can be a straight line.  You make it a zigzag because you get emotional  and you get distracted and all these different things.  But if anyone's looking for like some direction there,  go and rewatch that video.  It's called Exhausted But Satisfied.  And go and set your targets because I know for me,  I have to have that clear map to keep me on track.  And admittedly, this year, I, yeah, this, this,  I even think, I think I posted about this  or I think I did a live about this.  But we, you know, I've made, this year I made more money  than I've ever made, I think.  But it wasn't, because there wasn't like insane growth  like there was, you know, in 2020, for example,  those years always feel better  because you have this, this huge growth.  Even if you make the most amount of money ever,  but you only made slightly more than last year,  it doesn't feel near the same as going from zero to 10  or from 30 to 87.  And so I was, you know, in a lot of ways at my own fault  because I made my road zigzag.  I got distracted by a number of things.  And I, you know, a lot of the stuff I blamed  on personal stuff, which you can't bring into it.  But I'm going back to the drawing board,  back to creating my map,  back to getting even more simple than I am  because I've noticed I've let a lot of stuff creep in",

Why not?  Yeah, dude, for sure, man.  Yeah, I'm excited about 2025.  I think it's gonna be the best year  in this industry for a lot of us.  For everybody who's doing it,  I think it's just gonna be off the rails.  Like, it is crying for it.  Pretty excited about it.  What's your, let's speak it into existence.  What's your revenue target by next year?  Don't be shy.  By the way, for anyone that thinks  I'm sitting here going,  oh, I don't want Ryan to pass me,  no bigger compliment than Ryan destroying my,  my highest was a 121, I think,  121 to 124 in a month.  It was one month.  We didn't have the systems in place.  We dropped back down.  But I've been like an average hundred.  I hope you obliterate, just so you know.  And that's, I mean that from the bottom of my heart.  So tell me the number now.  Um, I want to be, I want to be at, um,  my, my dream goal,  the one I would push for is 2 million ARR  by the end of 2020.  But I love that.  And that's my goal.  I don't know.  I don't know what that would be for my net.  I mean, yeah, 2 million top line.  Yeah, that'd be a great,  that'd be amazing, bro.  And it totally doable.  I think it can be done.  Yeah, guys.  One of the reasons why being in this group  and in groups like this is important  is just being around people  that have these big visions.  And so I know some of us are sitting there.  Oh my gosh, I got to get to 10K.  And then we've got people like Ryan  that's trying to get to $2 million this year.  So when you find people like Ryan,  keep them close to you.  Yeah.  Love this group.  Love visual landlords.  Learn tons here.  You guys are an awesome community of people.  I made probably lifelong friends in this group.  Nick knows what he's talking about, you guys.  Nick is the greatest resource  in this industry that you could find.  He does a phenomenal job  of making it very relatable and understandable.  And this is where I got started.  I was homegrown first in AOP  and then art of digital real estate now  and then digital landlords.  And there's so much that's possible in this industry.  So thanks to Nick and digital landlords  for having me on these calls  and for this great community of people.  Because honestly like the community  is what one makes it fun to do the business model  because you got people doing it with you.  And you learn from people that are in the group, right?  They try things and they work  and you add it into your agency  and you get better and they get better.  And people that it's not cheap to get in here  to get in this group, to be on this call ain't cheap.  And you'll find that",

There are miniature transitions in between each step and then this is the big transition.  This is the transition where we go from kind of pitching them and hooking them into, alright  let me grab your information and actually send you some leads, okay.  So what I like to do is after I explain the deal, which is I give you a couple leads,  we talk in a couple days, then I just transition really simple like okay cool what's the best  number and email to send the leads to, okay.  And they'll start giving it to me and they'll say oh well you know here's my email, okay  cool and then here's my phone number and this is then what we're gonna dive into.  Then what we're gonna do guys is we're gonna explain how these first couple jobs are going  to be handled.  They're going to be live transferred over.  So they just gave us the email, they just gave us the phone number and they go like  this.  Alright Jack so how this is gonna work, I need you to save and by the way guys, if this  is you that's gonna be transferring these first couple leads, which it probably will  be, tell them to save your number.  If you're gonna use a different number, tell them to save that number.  If you're gonna use a service, tell them to save that number.  If you're gonna use an in-house person, tell them to save that number.  Tell them the number that's gonna be calling them, but say something like this.  Alright Jack so how this is gonna work is these first couple.  I need you to save this phone number and save it all caps, name my company's evergreen,  put Nick, put answer, put money, put something because for these first couple what I'm gonna  do is I really don't want you having to spend a bunch of time doing this.  So I'm actually gonna call you with the customer on the phone and I'm gonna hand her directly  off to you and I'll make it easy, I'll just pretend that I work for you or whatever so  it doesn't seem like we have to explain a whole bunch of stuff.  But next time I call you and this phone is ringing, it is going to be me with the customer  on the phone and I'll just make a really smooth transition, introduce you guys, I'll step  out and you can schedule her for an estimate.  Sound good?  And by the way Mr. Business Owner, this isn't how we always do it, but just for these first  couple I don't want you having to chase leads around, call them, etc.  I wanna make this as easy on you as possible.  I want you to just get a taste of what this is like.  And that's how I explain it.  I don't ask, hey do you, like guys this is one of the mistakes I'm seeing people make  right now is they're saying, hey do you care if I live transfer?  We typically like to live transfer, are you good at that?  Do not ask questions, do not give them the option or they're just gonna confuse them.  Just say hey, here's how we roll baby.  First couple leads I'm gonna be calling you so save this number, tell them what to do.  Save this number, when I call and the next couple calls when I call you, I am going to  have a customer on the phone so do everything you can and look I understand you can't answer  all of them but do everything you can to answer because these are gonna be hot leads that  really, really want estimates,",

That's how you explain the live transfer process and the biggest mistakes I've seen is people  asking for permission, hey do you care if I live transfer these?  Nope, you tell them what you're gonna do.  People love being told what to do, I promise you, I know that sounds funny like I'm just  being hilarious, no, they like it.  They like when you sound professional, when you're bold, tell them what you're gonna do  and let them know, hey this isn't gonna be forever, I'm gonna do this for the first couple  so you can get a taste of what this is like after we put something together, if we end  up doing something, don't put too much pressure, after we end up doing something or if we end  up doing something, I'm just gonna send these directly to you or directly to someone that  scheduled your appointments but for these first, I just wanna hand them off live to  you so you can get a taste for it.  Guys, that's it, that is the transition process from who you are, we transition into what  you're doing, damn good reason, same thing, the deal which we just did in the last video  and now this is the actual transition step into getting the name, or sorry, getting the  phone number, getting the email, explaining the live transfer process and we're golden.",

OK, because this is the part that makes the business  model really sexy. OK, the business model is sexy even if you just do the arbitrage thousand bucks  a month, 500 and ads take the difference, but it becomes really sexy if it's a thousand bucks  a month that you're getting paid and you can turn the ads to 100 bucks a month or to 50 bucks a  month or completely off and you can make 90 plus percent profit margin. And OK, it also this is  another thing that's so dope about SEO is it mitigates your risk, right? If we're only relying  on ads and all of our leads are coming on ads, coming from ads, and then something changes with  ads, we're screwed. Right.

We need to be we need to get. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We need to be  getting all of this special delivery. Thank you.

It's not that if they sign a six month contract, you're even going to take them to court like let's be real, the amount of money it's going to cost you to take them to court and how much you're going to get it's not really worth it.  The fact of the matter is when they know that there's a contract and they physically or or they intentionally sign it.  That is them committing. Okay. And I always use this analogy. Is it easier for someone to end a relationship that is like a boyfriend girlfriend relationship, or a marriage.  You might have like some real shit going on in your marriage but because you've committed because you've gone through that process you've signed that shit.  And because it's not as easy to get out of without having a little bit of like shit happen.  People think twice man people think twice three times four times sign that thing, even though you know damn well that like at the end of the day you're probably not going to get anything from them in court.  It's them signing it's them committing and here's how I pitch the contract gene. I say look yeah of course there's a contract. I'm committing to you I'm 100% exclusive to you. I can't talk to any other business owners.  So if we don't do an agreement, then that's like me being committed to you but you can quit at any time, right. I'm committing to you I'm not I'm ceasing all conversations with business owners.  I'm not calling on you that's like having a marriage where only one person's married the other person could do whatever the hell they want. Doesn't make sense. Yes, there's a contract it's six months at the end of six months if you don't like me I don't like you we end that shit.  Okay, but my guess is that at the end of this thing, you're just going to ask me if I can keep the price of the same and not increase the price because I'm going to be killing it for you.

You are going to give an answer from a client  Let me repeat that when you answer an object when somebody asks you a question  Okay, a client asks you a question. Hey, how are you different the home advisor? Hey, how does your pricing work?  Hey, how do you guys do flat fee?  Etc or when you are doing your screencast or you're overcoming an objection, you know is going to come up  Instead of answering it just blah and this is what this is the answer  You're going to take a little bit more time and you're gonna answer that question  By using a client's answer to answer that question.

You're hooking the business owner  Like we talked about in step three or sorry step four module four  I'm losing my numbers here in module four where you're actually hooking the business owner  You call them they're interested you go through the script and you're kind of at the end and they're one of those people that starts asking  Questions, right they keep asking questions and you're trying to like avoid it, but they keep asking  Okay, so business owner for example, they would say something like  Okay  So tell me real quick before we end this like how are you different than home advisor?  Okay, most of us would start rambling on well  We we don't we don't do shared leads number one, sir  well, I  Mean whatever the 17,000 different reasons and canned responses are we we work exclusively with one company  We make sure the leads are qualified but whatever whatever the reasons are that you give of saying you're different than home advisor  Once you respond they expect you to have a certain response like they know you've been asked  So when you say it it is what it is  But here's what you're gonna do is instead of answering that  You know answering that question just the way that that you hear it or the way you understand it  You're gonna use a client. Okay, so for example  This is how you're gonna answer instead of saying yeah  Well, we don't do exclusive leads you could say well, and this is kind of the response  I like to give is if somebody says something like that and say hey, what's the difference between you and home advisor?  Well, and I'd say something like well, basically the only thing that's the same as we work with contractors  No, but for real and then this is what I would say I'd say so I'd say no  But for real like we have a guy his name is Joe  He's he's our duct cleaning client in Chicago. You can look up his site as Chicago duct cleaning  And his biggest thing because he was working  He was actually working just like you with home advisor for like three years  His biggest thing and we just talked him last week is he's keep saying over and over is like dude  Just the fact that I don't have to worry about  Competing with four other companies in town and I have the lead exclusively to myself has made all the difference in the world  So just so you know, we work with one company exclusively and we don't share the leads  You say that guys you use it like that  It's a little bit it takes a little bit more effort of thinking and it gets it gets easier  But you use that and now it's not me saying it's Joe. It's Joe the duck cleaner in Chicago  It not only does it hold way more weight, but it also builds authority",

    "pageContent": " Hey, guys, we're shooting this extra video clip to go over using keyword planner, a Google keyword planner to set your CPC limit for your bids in the original video that you saw when we did it for whatever reason, it was showing really not a lot of great data for Bentonville, Arkansas for concrete, even though we all know that there is CPC and we can see it.  So we want to just make an extra one just to show you what you'll more likely see so you understand what to do when that is happening.  Okay, so in this example, I just did Val Dosta, Georgia tree service tree removal and tree trimming ran it and you can see here.  These are my metrics that I'm getting.  We have our three main keywords tree service tree removal and tree trimming.  We have some search term here tree service near me.  We have some search term and you can see here you have top of page bid and low range and the high range.  Okay.  And then when I go through here, I look at my CPC for my main keywords and I have 781.  I have eleven dollars that have eight forty seven.  I have five seventy five eight eight twelve eleven ninety one.  That's for land clearing.  So that may not be relevant to my my my customer or my client stump grinding is really cheap.  And tree pruning as well eight forty seven tree stump removal.  That's eight eight twelve.  So you can see most things are in that eight to nine dollar range, which isn't too bad for tree service.  Okay.  You have a few bump ups into eleven dollars.  So some of this is going to be when you have this kind of variance in your limits, you you kind of have to decide what you want to do.  And my advice is always going to be I take my my highest top of page bid on the high range.  And I bid one penny more.  Now, here I have eleven dollars and down here I have eleven ninety one.  But this is for land clearing.  And I don't really want to get into that unless I have a client that specifically wants that.  So I'm not going to use that into my factory in here.  But everything else is in this eight dollar nine dollar range, a few that are a little smaller.  And then I get to the eleven dollars for tree removal near me.  Now, again, that's a very valuable keyword.  So Google's telling you that's a premium keyword, right?  So if I was setting this up, I would set up my max CPC bid to eleven oh one.  If for some reason you said that's way too expensive for me and I'm not going to do it, that's OK.  You can see that you still have potential to win a bid here in the range.  The low range is three twenty.  The high range is eleven.  OK, I can tell you from most of my experience, you rarely see a top of page high.  The high range of the top of page bid, unless you're in a very competitive competitive niche and a competitive area.  But with that, if you wanted to take out the eleven dollar one, then I would just drop down to my next highest one,  which I think might be this tree trimming one at eight forty seven.  Let me verify that.  And that would be that.  So I would bid eight forty eight.  OK, and that would give you most of these main keywords that you want.  You may lose out on some of these premium ones right here, but you're going to be in the hunt for them.  OK, so that's how I would deal with that.  That's a common question we get.  So we want to just make this video to address it for you",

So instead of obscure niche its obscure city  And so what I argue is instead of the riches are in the niches  I believe the riches are actually in the cities  So what you need to realize is as you're going through and we're gonna pick our niche in this section first of all  We're not gonna overthink this because a lot of people get hung up wouldn't it should I go into oh my gosh  You know the world's ending. I don't want to make the wrong move. No, we're not gonna do that  Okay, but you either need to go into a really obscure niche that you can then go into most any city because no one's done it  Or you do what I did which is you go into some regular niches that we know work  okay, and I'm gonna go into some of those are getting a couple of examples and  You take these regular niches and you spend your time finding cities that nobody has thought of heard of or would even  Consider going into but you know because I'm gonna teach you that this this this and this all match up and you are going  To have success. Okay  So you need either need to pick an obscure city and a regular niche or an obscure niche  And then you can go into regular cities  All right  so it's when it comes to niching there's a couple of criteria that you need to look at and that I  Really really really really strongly feel that need to happen  so  Number one is the niche that you select needs to be medium to high ticket now the way that I define this is  Where oh by the way, we're talking about what the customer charges to the the homeowner  Okay, so customer goes in your customer goes in talks to the homeowner performs the service performs the job  What did they charge that needs to be medium to high ticket?  So I would consider medium to high ticket at the bare minimum a thousand dollars. Okay gross  So they're charging the right in an invoice for a thousand bucks up to  1015 K and I'm not gonna go too deep into this  But I actually don't like it to go much past that because then we get into a long sales cycle  And it's a little bit more difficult to do  However, I would err on the high side rather than the low side and it's very simple  The reason that we do this is if the customer can charge high prices to their customers the homeowners  There's gonna be more money  For us to charge higher retainers  It's also gonna be easier for",

    "pageContent": "us to justify a higher ticket price when we go and charge them monthly or weekly for our service  Okay  Second thing when we're talking about niche criteria is there has to be good demand  There has to be good volume and what I mean by that is there has to be a certain amount of people  Actually searching for that service in that city. Okay, because for example  Let's take the niche artificial grass, which actually is a really good niche  It's one I'm gonna I'm gonna explain here in a moment that niche is excellent in some cities  but if you were to type in artificial grass in  For example the city that I grew up in which is this not even a city it's a little town first of all  There's not you know that many people there. But secondly  People there don't spend that much money on their yards  And so if you started looking at the metrics you would quickly see there is not that many searches  There's not that much demand for artificial grass in the city. In fact, I don't know one person in the city  I grew up that has artificial grass. I can't think of one house  So we do need to make sure there is  Good demand good search volume. I'm gonna show you how to do that. Don't stress about it  The third thing is there needs to be no brand loyalty  What I mean by that is with let's take a niche like concrete  Okay, when I got my concrete done, I extended my pool deck. This is last summer. I  Went in and I looked at well, this is actually a little bit different for me because I had some clients  But I went and got a couple of estimates. Okay, and I did not check if they had a license  I didn't have them send me previous projects. I didn't like I didn't care about any of that  I just said hey and I had one of them was my client. I had him come give me a bid  I had a couple other people give me bids. I  Didn't care what they're I didn't even know what the company LLC was called or their their business, right?  So we want those type of niches because when we build a site  That is branded very generically right or unbranded  We want to be able to make sure that people are still gonna call us  So an example of this is like for for like solar  Solar panels, right if you're gonna put solar on your house, you're going to check out who the company is  You're gonna check out the reviews. You're gonna want to see the projects  They've done you want to see the license and this then blah blah blah blah, because that's a huge business  It's a big commitment. So that for example is a niche that is very brand loyal  So just to recap on those two things number one is you want to make sure it's medium to high ticket  You want to make sure there is good volume and you want to make sure there is no brand loyalty  All right  Let me give you some good examples of good niches that I would recommend going into and some examples of bad niches  So good examples  Concrete and these are all by the way  I don't give you examples unless I've made money concrete one of my favorite niches tree service great niche  artificial grass awesome niche spray foam insulation awesome niche  Masonry block wall awesome niche. I'm trying to think if there's anything else comes to my mind  Duck cleaning is is kind of in that gray area. It's a little bit too low ticket. I won't do duck cleaning anymore  It's not terrible. You could probably sneak, you know a decent sized deal, but it's it's an okay niche  I don't love it. Okay  bad examples, okay, so those are good",

There's so much money in roofing that people are spending ridiculous amounts of money on advertising  They're buying billboards. They got custom wraps in their cars and I'll bet you as you're watching this  There's probably one person if you think who's the roofing boss in my town  There's somebody that comes to mind  Whereas with concrete there's not really like, you know  The guy or the company the girl that's out there. That's like that's the the concrete person, you know  It's there's very little brand loyalty. So dentistry  roofing solar  Another one I found to be very difficult as HVAC. That's a pretty brand loyal deal  Electrician for whatever reason has been not great  So good ones tree service spray from insulation concrete, etc bad ones  Dentistry anything medical roofing solar  Whatever. Now one little caveat is if you're gonna look at a niche like roofing don't do it  However, I have made a decent amount of money in roof repair because it's more niche more niche  More whatever you want to call it then roofing not as many people want to go after it  not as many people care because they're just coming to fix a tile or coming to fix this or that and so those are  The good examples was the bad example  So guys I'm gonna show you a couple of examples of some niches that I have gone into and made some money  Some decent amounts of money in these niches. So  First one is tree service  As you can see st. George tree service  I'm actually what's interesting about this one is I have made over  $20,000 in this specific niche and this specific city. So this website, okay, and  What's interesting is I'm not even ranked number one. I'm ranked one two  I'm ranked number six. Okay. Here's my website. I'm ranked number six website doesn't look that great  I've made over $20,000 here. Okay  incredible, okay that this blows me away my  What's even more fascinating is my GMB. I do have a GMB. It's verified for whatever reason  We just can't seem to put it in the maps. It kind of you know ebbs and flows, but we're still making money  We're making a thousand dollars plus per month for the last couple years. So I'm not complaining  okay, another one that I mentioned as a good example was concrete and  We have you know made a good chunk of change in this niche as well. So st. George concrete st. George concrete  And here you have it. Okay this outside same format. We did get some nice photos taken and  That's it. So those are just a couple of examples. I love concrete. I love spray foam insulation  I love tree service as I mentioned and  You don't need to overthink this guys  What I want you to do is in this module and actually before you move on to the next lesson  I need you to pick a  Niche, okay, and I don't want you to overthink it and I don't want you to spend a week on this  I don't even want you to spend a day on this and I'm gonna tell you right now if you're somebody that's like  Analysis paralysis you're gonna hesitate you're gonna overthink it  I'm gonna just go ahead and tell you pick concrete pick concrete right now pick that niche because it's amazing. It works  I've made tons and tons and tons of money and think about it every city  I don't care where you grew up what village I grew",

I would make sure to do everything you can,  get this sucker ranked, manage those expectations, and get ready to get that business owner into a  sixth month to a year contract as soon as possible. What I would do is after month two,  I would start, I would figure out maybe we need to bump up the ads a little bit.  Maybe we need to like check in extra, whatever, because I know that between month two and three  is when I need to renew. And if you don't renew for at least six months in October,  there's a good chance they're going to cancel. If you go to a month to month,  by December things slow down and it's Christmas and all these different things,  it's going to be a problem. So what I would do is I would crush it for this person in both areas.  In between months two and three, I would really up my game so that you can get those  re-signs into the six month a year contracts. And then you could kind of take a little bit  of a deep breath and go back to your strategy. But from experience, that's what I would do.  Also a friendly reminder, guys, I would not be recommending a six month contract right now.  August, September, October, November, December, January, that's going to put you in a really  weird spot. You're going to have a contract ending at the end of Christmas. And unless you're in the  snow removal niche and you're in a city that has snow year round, which I don't know if there are  any, it's going to be a problem. So guys, I know the training says six month contracts,  but we have to also use our head. Right now, I would do what Edward is doing. I would either  do a three month or I'd do a nine month. I would definitely push for the nine month before the  three month. But keep in mind, if you do a six month, the contract's going to end in the middle  of the freaking winter and it's going to be a problem. It's really hard to renew contracts,  relatively speaking, in the middle of the winter.",

    "pageContent": " I want to remind you guys that as we're getting into SEO,  as we're talking about SEO questions, and by the way,  this is the part after you get the deal and I've had this question asked like,  can you not build a website? Can we just have the one pager? Can we have the ads running the  one pager and we charge a thousand and we spend 500 and take the difference? Yes, we can. I've done  it. I did it on accident and I've made money for a whole year, made whatever, $600, $6,000 net,  because it was $1,500, made 500 bucks a month times 12, $6,000 net, didn't even know. Yes,  you can. However, I would highly, highly, highly, highly encourage you that once you get the deal  and you get enough deals that your bills are covered and you are like, okay, now it's time  to go and build these properties that you take the profits and you actually go and build the  properties because this is the part that makes the business model really sexy. The business  model is sexy even if you just do the arbitrage, thousand bucks a month, 500 and ads take the  difference, but it becomes really sexy if it's a thousand bucks a month that you're getting paid  and you can turn the ads to a hundred bucks a month or to 50 bucks a month or completely off  and you can make 90 plus percent profit margin. This is another thing that's so dope about SEO  is it mitigates your risk. If we're only relying on ads and all of our leads are coming from ads  and then something changes with ads, we're screwed. What I recommend is if Google has  a way to get leads, let's try to tap into all. Let's try to get leads from ads. Let's get leads  from GMB and let's get leads from the organic. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.  We need to be getting all of this special delivery, thank you, of the monster. I told  my wife to bring this thing up because you just never know when I'm going to need that. Thank you.  Thank you. We want to mitigate our risk. We want to have leads coming in from ads,  we want to have leads coming in from GMB and from organic. For those of you that are freaking out  going, oh my gosh, I haven't got any GMB, blah, blah, blah. Guys, I've gotten tons and tons and  tons of deals where all I had was organic leads coming in. No GMB, no ads, but again, if we can  get leads coming in from all three different areas, it mitigates our risk. Number one is that.  Number two, this is the last thing that I wanted to cover is with SEO. Number one, make sure that  we do build the website because that's what changes it from a great business model to an ultra sexy,  the best business model with the highest profit margins with low risk. We mitigate our risk.  We secure ourselves in those positions and we keep our clients. Make sure we build those websites.",

No, no, no, no. If you have a site that's getting leads and it fits the due diligence,  passes the sniff test, go sell it. And if you can't sell it, because whatever reason,  you tried a couple of times and you're just kind of stuck, set it down. That doesn't mean  you need to go onto your next one.

They're not trained in sales, not always.  If you find one that are good at plumbing  and business people, those ones are really good.  Typically you don't find that.  So you have to remember, it's kind of like,  like I guess, so Aaron, Aaron is currently single,  just FYI for any of the ladies out there.  At some point, Aaron's gonna start fricking working  the field, Aaron's gonna start hunting, you know?  He's gonna start fricking prowling around  and he's gonna wanna have a list of things,  even if it's in his head of things that he's looking for.  And as much as he'd like to have every single  one of those things, which he could,  he may be looking for a long time.  And so you kind of have to have this list  within your head of like, what do you want  that business owner, it's your partner.  What are the things ideally you'd want  that business owner to have?  And then in what order are they most important?  And to me, the most important thing is a hunger for leads.  Because if they're hungry for leads,  then they're gonna do their very, very best.  And they may not be perfect on the phone.  They may sound really gravely and scary  and they might have not great customer service,  but at least they're hungry, they're following up,  they want that business.  On the other hand, they can be the best talker  in the world, they can be the best whatever communicator.  But if they're not hungry for the leads,  they're not, like Francesca said,  they're not gonna call them.  They're not gonna address them.  They're not gonna, you're gonna really,  really get frustrated.  So to me, the number one thing I look for  is a hungry business owner.  And how do we know that guys?  Aaron, how do we know someone's hungry typically?  When they actually are responsive?  They're responsive, but also going back  to building the list is-  Oh, they're already paying for it, yeah.  They're already paying for it.  Because if they're already paying,  they're either A, hungry for more leads,  or B, they're allergic to money, right?  And the chance of it being B is low, right?  So, great question.",

And a lot of you guys, I know it's like, oh my gosh, content, it's the worst, it sucks.  Back to what I said.  This is one of those areas, if we can get good at it, if we can master it, this is going  to give us that edge over the competition.  So again, change your mindset from this is a burden to how do I master it, how do I get  good at it.  And that segues perfectly into when should you outsource your content.  It's the same answer as when you should outsource anything after you master it.  If you do not know how to write content yourself, how are you going to outsource it?  How are you going to know that the person that you gave it to wrote good content?  How are you going to know that they didn't plagiarize it?  How are you going to know that it's decent content?  You're not unless you personally know how to write it and you're not going to be able  to know how to train on it.  Number one, don't start or try to outsource something until you first have mastered it.  We are going to be coming out with some resources if you decide that you want to start outsourcing  content in the future, but for now go master it and let's go rank these websites.",

    "pageContent": " Alright guys, congratulations. At this point, you've gotten your first deal and if you're  watching this and you haven't, it's okay. Keep doing the process. Keep putting the reps  in and you will get a deal. But I want to cover what do you do after the deal, right?  You get the deal, the business owner gives you the credit card number, they give you  their information, all that stuff. What do you do then? What I like to do, the last couple  things that I like to do once they've given me the credit card before I end the call is  I let them know, hey, so here's what's going to happen. I'm actually, Mr. Business Owner,  I need first of all, what's the business address? Because I want to have the business address  for the contract. I want to know the legal business name. I'm going to write that down.  And I'm going to tell them, I'm going to be sending over two documents. I'm going to be  sending over an exclusivity agreement, which is how I phrase it, which basically will tell  you that this is 100% exclusive. It indicates the price. And by the way, and I'll say this,  by the way, most people, I know it's 2,000 bucks a month, most people just like to do  the 500 a week, so it's not as big of a deal. Do you want to do 500 a week? 2,000. Doesn't  matter to me, okay? Let's do the 500 a week. Cool. I like weekly, by the way, guys, because  I can monitor it more and you actually make a little bit more money over the course of  the year. So I prefer the weekly, but it's up to you. And I'll say, I'm going to have  two documents coming to, what's the best email? Let me grab that. I'll grab the email. Okay.  I'm going to send over the exclusivity agreement and I'm going to send over a credit card preauthorization.  All that's going to do is that's going to legally allow me to charge your card every  week so I don't have to bug you every single week. Okay. So all I need is those two signatures  and then who do you want the leads going to? Okay. Like what email, what address, et cetera?  I just grab it right there. So, okay, so it's going to go to you. Cool. What's the number?  Okay. Cool. And what's the email? Cool. So awesome. This sounds good. All I need you  to do, I'm going to get this going immediately. We'll have calls coming to you. Could be as  early as today. It may take a day or two depending on what comes in, but I'm going to get those  two documents. All I need is two signatures and we are ready to rock and roll. Awesome.  Thanks Brian. Thanks Jack. Thanks Tara. Thanks Tracy. Whatever. Boom. End the call. Okay.  Immediately. I don't go take a pee. I don't go get a drink. I don't treat myself to lunch.  I get the credit card signed. I get the deal run. So first thing I do is I run the card.  Okay. I set up the, I create the customer, set up the subscription, run the card, which  I'm going to show you how to do. Then I send over the contract and I send over the preauthorization  before I take a deep breath because this deal ain't done yet. Okay. You do have the card,  but the deal ain't done yet. So let's hop over",

Go set up a Stripe account. If you have questions,  by the way, they've all been asked in the Facebook group, go and Google Stripe and you'll  see people have had some very specific questions. You can go look at those. Okay. Not difficult.  I like Stripe. I know the fees are a little high or whatever. I don't care. I believe  money loves speed. I'll take that for the speed, the convenience and all that. I love  Stripe. Okay. So what you're going to do is once you come in, you're going to go over  to the customers tab. Okay. And you are going to add a customer and you're going to put  the customer in here. We'll just use this example. So we'll call it John Doe. Okay.  John Doe. I only fill out two things. I do the name and then the email. So John at Doe.com  add customer. Okay. That's step one. Step two is you need to come over and you need  a product. Okay. And what I do is I go and I push add product. Okay. And I'm going to  call this Queen Creek Concrete Leads. Okay. I leave the description blank or you can copy  the same thing down. It doesn't matter. And if you're going to do monthly, you're going  to put in 2000. If you're going to do weekly, you can put in 500, but do not forget to change  this to weekly. Okay. Because if you do, if you don't, you're going to be charging 500  a month and not realize it. Okay. So change it to weekly and just save it. Very simple.  So we've created the customer. We've created the product. Now you can just go back to your  customer list, click on John and go over where it says subscriptions and push create. You  can do it there or you can go to actions and push create subscription. Doesn't matter.  It's the same. And what's going to happen is you're going to search for first of all  the customers there, then you're going to search for the product, which usually pops  up first. Stripe smart enough to know you're probably going to be setting up that product,  that subscription, click on your product says 500 a week. And now here's what you're going  to do. Okay. You're going to go over and it's going to start on today's date and I'm going  to put it to go forever. I'm not going to have a stop on it because I don't want there  to be a stop and me losing money. I would rather the customer hit me up and say, Hey,  you overcharge me and me refund it. And I lose a couple of bucks then to not get paid.  So I leave it as forever because I plan on working with these guys forever. Just so you  know, six months is just the beginning. Okay. You don't have to mess with any of this stuff,  blah, blah, blah. Okay. And then what you're going to do because you already have the credit  card number is you're going to go over and hit automatically charge a credit payment  method on file, push add a payment. And guess what? You put in the credit card number, you  put in the month and the year and you put in the CVC and you push add. Okay. And once  you do that, I'm not, I don't have a credit card here. You're going to push",

It will continue to build them  every single month forever or week. And you were done. That's how simple it is. This is  why I love Stripe. That took me 30 seconds. Okay. That's it. That's it. And this is what  I love about this too. I like to run the payment first before I worry about the contract because  that card, it'll say insufficient funds. And now you're like, okay, this guy, this gate,  this lady, she's yanking me around or this guy, this lady, they don't have money. Okay.  Or they gave me the wrong card or they're messing with me or whatever, but you're going  to know right there. So payments done. Okay. And it's set up. Then I'm going to go over  and this is going to be, it's going to be included as a download. It's also in the file  section of Stripe. You're going to fill out the lead generation and exclusivity agreement.  Now, the only thing you're going to need to change on this because this is just a template  is you need to go and change your information and just do it once and have it saved. Okay.  So that's your company and all that, all that good stuff. And you're going to need to change  down here in the governing law. You need to change this to your state and your county.  So it should not say Washington County and it should not say Utah. Okay. That is it.  And if you want to make sure you can search Utah, but those are the only two places is  those two spots, change those, change your information. And then what you're going to  do is you're going to drop in your customer's information. Okay. So I'll typically go file,  make a copy so I can save my template. And then I'm going to put John, sorry, client  is John's Concrete. Okay. Name of the company as I put, or sorry, name is John Doe address,  blah, blah, blah, whatever, email john at doe.com. Okay. And only other thing I add  here is I will put location is Queen Creek AZ industry is, and if you want, you can just  do flatwork concrete if you want to, if you guys just agreed to flatwork and not decorative  and change the term. So six months, whatever, put that in there. And then the monthly fee  or you can change it to say weekly fee. So in this case, I'm going to put weekly fee  is going to be 500 a month or 500 a week. And that's it. And then what you're going  to do is you're going to go file, download as a PDF. Okay. That's it. You're going to  come over and I like to use doc hub. Okay. The reason I like to use doc hub is because  you get five free signatures. It's very simple. But you can use doc. You sign. It doesn't  matter what you use. I've always used doc hub for my lead generation clients. Okay.  You're going to come over here and you're going to sign up for the free. I'm going to  sign in really quick with my account. So give me one moment. All right guys, here we are  in doc hub. Very simple. You're just going to go new document. Okay. You're going to  upload it and you're going to go to your downloads and you're going to find that download  that you had. Okay. And you're going to want",

And then I'll put, um, like John's concrete dash  flat fee lead generation agreement, blah, blah, blah. I want this to be very, I'm thinking,  okay, what happens if this client does a back charge or tries to refund? I want this to  show like, I want striped look at this and go, okay, this guy could have never been confused.  The document is called lead generation agreement. So he can't claim he didn't know. Okay. So  just, just overkill, but I like to name it something there. It's also easily searchable.  And then you're going to go and do a couple of easy things. Okay. You're going to hit  this a tool and you're going to go drop in the date. So today's date is 23 June. Okay.  Make it look good. Don't just slop it in there. Okay. And then again, June 23rd and 23 June,  which clearly I'm being sloppy here. Boom. Okay. 23rd June. Okay. And that is all you  need in terms of what you need to fill out. And then what you need to do is you need to go  push sign. You're going to need to create your signature the first time. But then once you have  it, you can just come in here, drop your signature. And by the way, just for those of you that missed  that, just click sign and it's going to, you're going to grab your signature and draw it down.  Okay. So I signed and then you're going to go to this little thing right here. It says manage  fields. You're going to click on it and you're going to go to the signature one and you're going  to drop it right here. Okay. And you're going to go over to the assignee and you're going to put  john at doe.com and you're going to add. Okay. If you can see his initials, J O, which I don't  know why it says J O, but it should say J D or I don't know, but it says J O whatever,  but it says right here, he's assigned. So this says if that would be not assigned,  I'm going to assign in that field and you are done. All you need to do is push prepare sign  request. And when I push send request, this is going to send him to the email that you put on  file right here. It's going to send him the document that he or she can open up and with  their finger or from their computer sign, and it will send you a copy and you are done with  the contract. That's it. Okay. Very, very simple. You're done. Then what I do is I hop over to the  credit card authorization. So I go to new documents. I already have this thing saved as an  authorization. I'll search for it. I don't know if I have it downloaded, so I might need to do that  really quick. I do not. So let me go over to this. And by the way, this is in the file section. Let  me download this on this computer really quick. Boom. Go back over to doc hub upload and let's  look under my downloads. Credit card authorization is hiding right there. Beautiful. And same thing,  you're just going to fill this out. So again, I'll probably put their company name. I'll put  John's concrete credit card authorization. Okay. I'm going to put the, I'm going to",

Let's call zero  seven of 26, make it look nice. And then I don't know why this one doesn't include it. We need to  just fix the template, but I always add the CBC here just so I don't honestly, so I don't forget  it. Cause I'm going to throw that piece of paper away. So let's say it's six, four, two. Okay.  Billing address eight, four, sorry, eight, four, seven. I know that's mine. We're just using an  example. And then you're going to fill us out for them. So I John dough. Boom.

And you're going to add John at dough.com, push add and assign it to him. You push prepare  sign request. You send the request and guys, you are done. You have the credit card charged.

In other words, what are things you do to help improve Google acceptance?  Guys, I don't spend a bunch of time with GMB anymore, okay, because to me,  can you? Yes. Is it still possible? Yes. We actually recently got a GMB in the last two weeks,  trying some new strategies, but I have not found anything that's tried and true that I'm  confident saying, hey, here's the new strategy. What I've kind of opted to do instead is that  I am going to focus on getting better at ads and getting better at organic rankings faster,  okay, because guys, think about it like this. I've said this before, but you got to realize that  when we have with Google, right, you can get leads from paid ads, you can get leads from  the Google My Business or the local, and you can get leads from organic, and if you can get two of  those three, you're going to be just fine. Back in 2020, when I was just trying to figure things out  on more than half of my websites, or at least half of my websites, I didn't even have a GMB  because it didn't click to me. It didn't occur to me that I could use the business owner's address.  I didn't understand all this stuff, and so I was going along getting deals scaling up to $100,000  a month, not realizing that I even needed a GMB. You don't need a GMB. Now, if you can get one,  does it help? Sure, but even if I have them, I don't like to rely on them for leads because I  feel like they're always problems. You're falling off, you're doing this, you're getting suspended,  you're checking, checking, checking. So for me, I just decided, you know what, I'm going to focus  on getting better at the things that I know how to do, which is ads and organic, and if we can get  the GMB, great, if we can't, then whatever. However, I will tell you that yes, the Facebook  business page does help, the Yelp page does help, but me personally, I'm just focusing on,  I told you guys, I'm in simplification mode. I'm in, hey, these are the things I know that work,  so I'm going to focus on them, and so that's what I've tried to put my effort on. That doesn't  mean you can't, doesn't mean that's not a possibility, but that's where I'm putting my focus.",

    "pageContent": " Now that we have expanded our keyword list, I'm going to give you a list of rules that  we follow when we are writing content.  Whether you're going to outsource the content to someone or you're writing it yourself,  we still follow these rules and they're very basic rules that we follow by.  One piece of advice is I would actually, if this is the first website that you're starting  on, I would actually write the content myself.  I know it's a pain, but by doing so, you know exactly what you're going to outsource and  it's always better to know what you're doing before you give that word to someone else  because that way you can set expectations and you know what you want back.  So here's starting, let's start, I'm going to write a paragraph.  So again, we use Basecamp.  All right.  So I created a new doc.  I'm actually going to, I usually keep them separate for each page.  So we're going to talk about this later, but each page, I would probably keep it a separate  doc.  I'm talking about the content.  So homepage, content, name it whatever you want.  Okay.  And let's just start with a little paragraph so you can kind of get an idea.  So number one rule is the first word of your paragraph, especially on the homepage, especially  the very top paragraph, the one that we put that little corner image, you want it to be  a keyword.  So if you're, if your website is Queen concrete or whatever it is, you probably want to be  saying something like Queen Creek concrete.  Or you can even, cause you always, so one of the rules is you actually want to sound  like you own the company.  So you don't want to sound like a third person or a third party or just in a weird way, you  always want to sound like you are the owner of the company.  So you can say something like here at Queen Creek concrete and remember that your company  name is going to be the location and the service.  Keep it simple.  So in my case, it's Queen Creek concrete.  If it was in Las Vegas concrete, I would just say here at Las Vegas concrete and keep that  consistent because if you change the name within the content, you're going to sound  unprofessional.  So you want to keep it consistent and keep the name of the company that you have assigned  yourself the same as in the header, the same as in the content everywhere, the same as  in the, in the GMB everywhere.  You are called Queen Creek concrete.  Just keep it consistent.  Do not have 10 names because an actual company would have one name only.  Okay.  So here we go here at Queen Creek concrete, we, and again, talk as if you were part of  the company, we at, we offer service, we offer all types of residential and commercial concrete  services and then whether, whether you are looking for concrete driveway or concrete  patio, we have got you covered.  Okay.  I'm going to pause and kind of read you some of the rules that we have.  So number one, again, start with a keyword.  Okay.  Queen, Queen Creek concrete is a keyword because we have the location and the service.  Another one would be to create a bullet list and I would keep it one bullet list or a number  list, whatever list you want to do per 1000 words.  And what that is, is you don't want to start with a bullet list that looks a little silly.

    "pageContent": "Okay.  Here are some of the top services that our local contract, contract tours cover.  And here's where we do the bullet list.  The reason why we do a bullet list is because it's a very easy way to add keywords.  Okay.  We can put concrete driveway, stand concrete, concrete patio, concrete, I don't know, decorative  concrete, whatever it is, whatever your company you really want to rank for.  And you can, you can make it longer.  Of course, don't make like a two, two little items or a thousand, like keep it smooth and  professional.  Another, another easy way to get some ideas on what content to write.  You can actually get on Google and if you type concrete driveway near me, which is what  we're trying to go after.  And I'm sure you guys have seen this before.  If you go down here where it says people ask for, Google will give you an idea of what  people are looking for and their writing.  So you can even write these rhetorical questions within your content.  That's a very easy way you can.  So this one would be a great question because you can, and this is a really easy way to  get ideas on what content you're going to write about this subject.  Okay.  This is a great question.  What is stamped concrete driveway?  Okay.  So you can put that in here.  And again, we'll rearrange the content to run smooth.  What is stamped concrete driveway?  This could be one of our titles in the content and then you go and answer and say, stamped  concrete driveway is a great way to personalize and get the exact look that you have been  looking for in a driveway.  What is stamped concrete?  Our professional constructors will be able to give your concrete any texture.  I think they can do color too.  You want, I think, a type of the card of color, different pattern, textures, and color.  Okay.  We can add pattern as well.  Texture, pattern, and color.  So they can make concrete look like stone, but they can make concrete, you know, have  any type of pattern.  And that's really cool.  So that's a great way to add some content right there.  And this is a great tool.  And the more you actually expand these questions, the more questions come up.  So this is a very, very good idea.  One rule that we also usually follow is try to avoid the word cheap.  So we don't really put cheap concrete service.  That sounds like it's not really good quality.  So instead of using words like cheap, we use affordable.  Just be smart about the words that you're using.  Don't make it sound like you're Walmart, but make it sound like your actual professional  local company.  So then we have do not use more than 10 of the same keywords per thousand words.  That's why we expanded the keyword list.  So do not use the same 10 keywords per thousand words.  And that includes the location as well.  So not just concrete patio, but also don't keep saying here in New York, here in New  York, here in New York, or here in Queen Creek.  Do not keep repeating that more than 10 times per thousand words.  And I'm actually going to show you some resources and tools that you can use to track that down.  And then use both short tail and long tail keywords.  So make sure you are using something very short like concrete patio as a keyword, but  also you're also using something more lengthy like concrete driveway repair here in Queen  Creek, Arizona.  That would be a long tail.  They're both important.  Make",

    "pageContent": "sure after you're done writing your content, if you're writing the content yourself, you  probably know whether you plagiarize the content or you've wrote it yourself.  If you are outsourcing, make sure that you're checking the plagiarism and you're not copying  and pasting content from anywhere else.  This will really penalize you.  And you want to keep the plagiarism percentage below four percent.  Make sure, again, the company name, in my case, Queen Creek Concrete, that it's on your  header is always consistent everywhere.  Include the phone number in your content.  So like something that I really like, I think it's very easy and a good way, a good rule of thumb  would be to add the phone number once, at least once every thousand words.  And that's a very easy way.  You could say something like whether you're looking for a concrete driver or concrete patio,  we've got you covered.  And if you want to receive a free instant quote, get in touch with us by calling the following number.  And here's where you're going to add the phone number that we got from CarRail.  If I can find it.  Anyway, I'll add it in later.  I'll just put X, X, X, X, X, because I know that will mean adding the phone number.  OK, next rule, spell check everything.  A really good tool to have.  It's actually Grammarly.  So Grammarly, I'm pretty sure you have to pay for it.  There may be free tryout, but this is what it is.  You can actually add it on as an extension and it will follow you wherever you are,  whatever you have Basecamp or your website builder.  And not only it will spell check every word, but it will also rephrase the sentences to make them better.  So that's a very easy way to spell check and actually make the sentences.  And it will also correct like the punctuation.  So it's a really great tool to have.  And then again, write as if you were the owner.  Don't make jokes.  Don't try to be funny.  Again, we're not writing this to be entertaining.  Be simple.  Keep sentences short.  Keep it simple.  Don't plagiarize the content.  Make it like it's just a simple description of what the company does and what you do and what you offer.  And keep the keyword density.  What we talked about earlier.  Do not use the same keyword more than 10 times per thousand word.  Another way of looking at it is keep the keyword density less than five percent.  And here is a really good tool for that.  You can also use this to check for plagiarism.  It's free.  So just go on SEO review tools dot com and then you're going to add that one.  Let's do keyword density checker.  OK, it's super easy because you just put in so you can do the text input.  You can also put the domain that you have.  In my case, it would probably be text input because I haven't copied the content to my website.  So I'm actually just going to do this copy and paste it in here.  Perform check.  OK, see, I already need to edit my content because I've said that I know that you're like, OK, well, it's 10 times the actual extension of the keyword or the short keyword.  And I would say the short.  So I said concrete way too much.  The density right here is 19 percent and we want to keep it less than five.  So go ahead and go in and add more sentences, maybe some sentences that don't have keywords just to make it less. ",

Guys, my name is Nick, this is Porter, we're brothers, and I'm just going to share a couple  things really quick.  If you can hear me, let me know, if I'm choppy, Moza can hear me all the way from South Africa,  so that means that it's working, okay?  So we're going to do this in 20 minutes or less, maybe 15.  What I want to talk about today, I want to, I think I titled this, how to make money building  simple websites with zero technical knowledge, okay?  The reason why I want to do this and go live, number one is because I've realized that no  matter how much you talk about what you do, you're going to get sick of talking about  it before people even know what you do.  I talk to people all the time, they're on my Facebook, they're, I think, maybe they  can't stop unfriending me.  I always think they're on my Facebook, they're like, so what do you do for work?  And I'm like, dude, I literally post about it every day and it's really annoying for  me, I can't imagine how annoying it is for everybody else.  So in an effort to let everybody know what it is I do, number one, number two, is I've  realized that when you start a business, when you start doing something that no one knows  about or that's new, there's kind of like four stages that you go through.  And here's the four stages that I went through.  Number one is it was like, I told everyone, hey, I'm going to start doing this thing where  I'm going to start renting these websites and building these websites.  It's kind of like real estate, but it's on which websites.  And I was like really excited.  And then people would just like crap on me.  They're like, oh, that's cool, bro.  But like, is that like, is that a viable business?  You know what I mean?  Like, is that really a way to make money?  I remember specifically somebody said that to me and really just pissed me off when I  was like, dude, I really, you just gave me motivation.  So that's kind of the first stage that you go through.  Then it was like, you start making money and people that they're like, well, he's either  lying or maybe he's making money, but it's because of these reasons that make it so that  he's a, he's an anomaly and no one else could do it.  It's just him, right?  Then what happens is you start to teach or have other people that you know, do it like  you Porter Porter started doing this.  He's making 10 K a month.  Our other brother, Zach started doing this.  He got up to three K a month before he got distracted.  I've had friends do it.  I've had all kinds of different stuff.  And then what happens is people like, all right, I'm going to start paying a little  bit more attention.  Right.  And then the fourth stage, which is what we're finally at, is that people look at it  and they're like, all right, it's legitimate.  If it weren't, then his brother and his friends wouldn't be doing it and talk about  it as well.  And I'm also sick of what I'm doing as a job or as a 95.  So",

    "pageContent": "let me check this thing out.  And so, and how can I learn?  That's kind of the stage.  Finally, I've been doing this for nine years.  That's finally where I've gotten to.  And so that's a little bit more fun to talk about.  But guys, no matter what stage you're at of this, I think you're going to find this  interesting.  And so just to kind of give you a little bit of background, I've worked with single moms,  single dads.  I've worked with millionaire business owners.  I've worked with real estate investors.  I work with doctors.  I've worked with like professional lawyers, college students, broke college students,  corporate American, nine to five people climbing the ladder and everything in between.  And one of those people that I've worked with or that I've like brought into this is  Porter, who like I told you, is my little brother.  And I wanted to specifically bring Porter on because not when Porter started doing this,  which was what, two years ago?  Yeah, like two years ago.  Not only did he had no sales experience, but he also had like negative tech experience.  Like that's right around two years ago.  It's right around the time you got your first like smartphone, right?  Basically, yeah, legit.  Yeah, between the two of us, not really.  I'm not saying that we have a combined ACT score that we're going to put on our Facebook page.  We're not technical people.  Okay.  And so whenever you bring somebody like me or Porter, it's like, all right, these guys  are just simple people.  If they can do it, I can do it.  So now guys, Porter, two years later, he makes $10,000 per month of renting these simple  websites.  We're going to show you one of these websites.  In fact, maybe I'll do that first.  But basically, I brought Porter on.  I want to just like have him share his experience, having no experience, no technical experience,  how he's been able to do it, ask him a few questions.  And then also one thing you should know, I'm going to show you guys an example,  is Porter doesn't do this full-time.  This is something that he does kind of on the side.  He works on the family farm.  He's taken over the family farm.  That's his main priority.  So this is like a part-time thing for him and which I think is very interesting to note  because he's not doing this full-time.  So a lot of you guys might be watching this and you have full-time jobs, which I know  you do because you're on this YouTube live right now, which means you're trying to escape  work and you're getting paid to do it.  But anyway, let me show you a quick example.  And then Porter, I'm going to pepper you with some questions.  Also on that note, Porter, as he's built this $10,000 per month business, he's also  got married.  He has a baby, how old is your baby, four months?  Four months old.  Amazing, dude.  So for those of you that are like, I have kids and I don't have time, whatever your  excuse is, you do have time, okay?  Okay, Porter, can you see my screen?  Yeah, I can see it.  I'm going to give you just a quick example.  This is what we do.  Basically, we build simple websites.  We get them to the top of Google.  And then when people call those websites, we get paid.

Basically, we're putting a customer and a business owner together using a website.  And you're going to see here in a second, we're anything but web designers, okay?  So I'm going to show you one of my ugliest websites I've ever produced my entire life.  If you type in tow truck St. George, Utah, towing St. George, Utah,  all the stuff around towing, you're going to go here.  And this very first listing here says towing St. George.  If you click on this, you're going to come across an absolute banger of a website, okay?  As you can see, this is a template that I use from a platform called Weebly.  And I know there's people on there right now that are probably like, oh my gosh,  how are you even making money on this?  That's the point.  I'm going to talk about that in a second.  By the way, Kevin Saba, my friend from Sierra Leone.  What's up, bro?  Is this come to crypto?  Kevin, I'm going to let you keep crypto because I'm Mr. Shiny Object.  If I get into crypto, then I'm going to go down the rabbit hole, not make any money.  And I'm eventually going to come back here.  So for now, I'm sticking with tried and true steady eddy.  You guys can keep all the money on the Trump and the Melania coin.  But when I come back to Sierra Leone, I do want to talk to you.  So this website right here, basically how it works.  If Porter gets, let's just actually use a different example.  Kevin Sessions.  What's up, dude?  Kevin Sessions from Cedar City driving to Vegas breaks down in St. George last exit.  He goes online.  He types in tow truck near me.  He comes to my website.  He calls this number.  I get paid, right?  That's it.  That's the whole model.  Now, just you guys have a little bit of context because I was curious exactly how much  we're making from this website.  I'm going to tell you the exact number that we're making per month and the exact amount  of money that we've made all time on this little website.  So I am making right now gross $500 per month.  I know it doesn't sound like a lot, but $500 per month.  And I have all time on this little website, which I think we built in 2019.  End of 2019, we've made $25,175.  Not bad for this.  Right?  To put it in context, okay, the last real estate property that I bought.  And when I say the last, I don't have hundreds of properties, I have four.  So let me not make this sound like I have like a bunch of property.  But the last one I bought, it was $415,000, 20% down.  So I put $80,000 into it.  I don't rent it out because there is a long story.  I don't rent it out to anyone.  I just have it.  But I priced it out.  If I were to rent it out, the most amount of money I'm going to make on that is like,  if I'm lucky, $150 a month, right?  So I'm making three times more on this stupid little website than I am on a property that  I put $80,000 into and I pay HOA and",

And by the way, I did a breakdown of it.  You can go to Spotify and type in digital real estate secrets.  You guys can check it out.  I broke down how much it would cost to build it.  $80 to build this.  Sweat equity probably 40 to 60 hours.  That's maybe $25,000.  And it's just on Senate and forget it.  So this thing, while I'm talking right now, this is bringing in phone calls.  While I'm sleeping, while I'm traveling, this is bringing in phone calls.  So the game is what we in Porter do is we just go and find cities and niches  where we can build these little websites, rank them really quickly,  find business owners that want these jobs.  And then we just forward the calls to the business owner and we get paid.  Okay.  So that's the model.  Did I miss anything, Porter?  No, that's perfect.  So I want to ask you some questions.  And by the way, anyone else that's on this call right now,  we've got Abu Bakar Ba, I'm guessing from Sierra Leone.  What's up, brother?  Zane Wilson.  What's going on?  Hope the moves going well, dude.  Tong Yang, Peter Bassi from Sierra Leone, Nick Maxwell.  If you guys have questions for Porter, great.  If not, you guys can just enjoy what he's about to say.  I've got some quick questions for you.  All honest, straight up.  Give me your real answers.  No sugar coating, no fluff.  Okay.  Sure.  Can you confirm how much you're making?  And can you also let people know that I have never helped you on any deal?  And by the way, Simon says hi, Nick and Kyle.  This is not Kyle.  Kyle's about twice as tall as this guy.  And he's like twice his age.  But this is Porter, my little brother.  They're nice to see you on, Simon.  Porter, how much you make it?  And sorry, how much you make it?  And can you confirm that you're doing this part time?  Just so that we were like on the same page.  Yeah.  So I'm making a little over 10K per month.  And what?  Give us an exact figure so people don't think that you're wrong, bro.  Sorry, say that you cut out like what?  What's your exact number?  Is it 10 and four?  Was that what it was?  It's 107, 10,000, 700.  10,700.  Okay.  And you're doing this part time, correct?  Yes.  Doing this part time.  And you, it's honestly, I was kind of mad at first because like, bro, you know exactly  how to do this business model.  Why don't you just like share these little secrets or like give me a little referral  on a few of these business owners?  But it's been so much more, it's been way more fulfilling to do it myself because I  actually am like so bought into it now because it took me as long as it did.  And I don't feel like I would have appreciated it as much if you would have helped me.  So yeah, I've given him no referrals.  In fact, I probably answer his calls less than",

And I will do that for you, but I'll make you pay me for it, right?  I'm sure you know that.  Okay.  Next one I've got is honest, honest, honest.  When you, because Porter, when I first started doing this, for real, Porter was on his  mission in Colorado.  He got back.  He knew what kind of what I was doing.  Truth be told, did you think that this was a bag of crap, what I was doing?  Or did you think it was legit?  Or would you just like, you just didn't know?  I honestly didn't even know what you did.  Like for the longest time, like it was funny.  I always thought you did something like for only one niche.  Like I knew bits and pieces about kind of what you did, but I had zero interest.  I had zero like, oh, that's cool.  You know, my brother's doing well.  And then I came home and then I was like, dude, life's expensive.  Being married is expensive.  Like I got to start making more money.  And then I was like, Nick, like, what are you actually doing?  And probably like most of you guys, you don't really care until you're like, dude,  like you're, what are you doing?  So that was kind of the interest I would say.  Like when I first like heard about it, it was almost like too good to be true.  I was like, dude, is this actually legit?  Like this seems so fake.  Like how do you have this website and you're making that kind of income per month?  Like that just doesn't make any sense to me.  You know what I'm saying?  Like it doesn't, it just seems too good to be true.  Yeah, no, for sure.  Porter Pelfett thought I was up to some shady stuff.  He's like, there's no way you're making money renting out these simple websites.  Um, okay.  I'm just going to go through these as fast as I can.  Cause I see some questions people have, which we're going to get to.  So Moza, I see you.  I've got a question is I'm going to address her in a second.  Um, truthfully, how has making an extra 10 K per month changed your life?  And I'll mean that in a cheesy way, but I mean like, what is, has it,  has it been like a breath of fresh air to giving you more flexibility?  Has it given you more confidence?  Like what was it?  Has it done for you personally, been able to make an extra $10,000 per month?  Which by the way, for somebody that, how old are you?  23, 24, 24 years old, married kid.  Uh, just 10 K on its own is, I mean, it's not, it's not the end all be all,  but that's not a bad thing.  You didn't go to college.  You don't have a degree, you know?  Um, so that even without the farming stuff, that's, that's not a bad little gig,  but yeah, how's it, what's it done for you and the family and your life?  It's been game changer.

And then I was like, dude, life with like a couple hundred bucks.  I'm like, dude, this is not okay.  Like this is stressful.  So to be able to make that kind of money, it takes a little bit off my shoulders to  make me feel like, okay, like this is good.  But also like I've got way more confidence in my ability to be able to make money.  Like I think my biggest thing was again, being in this bubble and not being able  to realize like the kind of money that's actually out there.  Like all you see is what's in front of you until you actually start being around  other people that are making this kind of money.  And it just like made me realize that like, dude, I can do more and I should expect  more out of life than just the use.  Yeah, I like that.  Did you have any experience building websites?  Did you even know how to log on like search?  I had some party on my phone for the longest time.  You gave me crowd for it because Chrome was the way to go.  But no, I had zero tech experience.  Like I didn't even have a lap.  I didn't own a laptop until like two years ago.  Seriously, or like anything like I didn't have anything.  And so I still am like.  I was just going to say this is one that a lot of people, I think they get intimidated.  They're like, yeah, I don't mind talking to people, but I don't know how to build a website.  I don't know how to do this thing called SEO.  I don't know how to any of this technical guys.  This business model isn't near as technical as you might think.  When I started, I actually didn't know what SEO stood for, which you might not either.  It stands for search engine optimization.  I didn't know what a domain was, which by the way, is just the website, the www dot whatever.  That's the domain.  I didn't know any of this stuff.  And here I am.  I'm like, yeah, I'm going to go start renting simple websites, building and renting simple websites.  So now I look back and I can see why people were like, dude, you're crazy because it made no sense.  But neither of us had any technical experience.  So Porter, from somebody really speaking, let's say that they're, I don't know.  40 to 50 years old, never built a website, probably not been at social media,  you know, whatever has to have their wife or husband log in for them.  How realistic is it for them to be able to be, to build one of these like websites  if they've gotten no experience actually like.  I think easy.  I definitely it's literally drag and drop depending on the platform you use.  I mean, you literally could go look at someone's website and say, hey, this looks good.  And then kind of like mimic how it looks or whatever.  But it's so easy.  You really don't need to over complicate it.  It's such a simple process that a lot of us get so scared.  But yeah, you could do that easy.  Okay.  Guys, I second that.  I think if I took my son, he's 11.  Oh yeah, he's going to be 12.  I think without question that I could put him through my training and ",

Did you have doubts about building and renting simple websites  when you started like what or what were your doubts?  Because for me, it makes to me, it makes total sense.  I made I make all my money doing this.  It's provided my lifestyle.  I bought real estate, real estate properties, all this kind of stuff.  That doesn't even cross my mind.  But I think when I started, I looked around.  It's not that I thought people were lying.  I just thought like, maybe everyone else can do it.  I can't.  Did you have any doubts when you started?  Yeah, well, dude, the only job I ever had was working on the farm.  And so to kind of be for you to be able to say,  you could make money on a computer or whatever.  Like you almost just think like, yeah, that's good.  But like not from from from my personality or this type of lifestyle.  Right.  So like when I did it, I was like, it's just it's just too complicated.  It's like I would do it.  But I also was afraid because I was like everything that I  the money that I made, I worked for.  Like I literally physically went and did it.  And then I got paid for it.  And so like to have that that like reincorporating income  was kind of like mind blowing to me.  And also starting out at however old I was and to have that money,  I was scared to like.  And this is like my first venture, you could say.  So maybe someone.  Oh, but for me, that seemed pretty big to be able to spend me.  And then expect to get it back.  Right. Because you don't have much to begin with.  And then to hopefully get it back, like if I make it work.  Right. And that was my I think.  And then finally, when it changed was when I was like, dude,  I'm going to do exactly what everything that you say,  exactly how it's supposed to be done.  And I don't care how long it takes.  And it finally just like every, every, every month or every day I did it,  I got more and more like bought into it.  And it finally just clicked for me.  And I was like, I'm just going to give everything I have.  And you just starts to fall into place.  So Porter, somebody guys that he has a really hard time sitting still.  If we're playing more games as a family, which I do not like to do, by the way.  So it's very rare nowadays.  But back when I used to semi enjoy this, he'll literally in between every turn,  he has to stand up.  He's walking around.  He's on his phone.  He cannot sit still.  So I remember your concern at the beginning was like,  how am I going to sit at a computer and do this?  How have you been able to do this?  I've never even asked you because it's very tough for you to like sit down and do this.  You're more of the go out, be on the tractor, move pipe, do that kind of stuff.  So this wasn't, I know you were worried about that.  How have you been able to, I mean, if you're taking Adderall or something,  you can just go ahead and let us know right now.  But what's the secret?  Oh, dude, I honestly, it's weird.  But I feel like",

But anyways, I honestly do better when I actually, it's funny because I farm full time.  I feel like that honestly is the best thing for me because I need to be able to have that kind  of escape of like do something with my body, get outside, like get my mind clear  and come back to the computer.  And it's like those like couple hours, like people that are watching this,  it's like you have such an advantage because like you're so dead.  That's what kind of pushed me was like, hey, I don't want to get out of this,  but I want to be able to like not rely on this source of income.  I want to completely like live my life off this.  And so like that kind of motivated me, but like I would do it for a couple hours a day,  but I felt like I got more out of the two hours at night after I got done farming,  then I did the eight hours of sitting at my computer because I can't focus for that long.  Like I literally can't just sit down for eight hours.  Like I have to do 30 minutes, go do something, 30 minutes, do something, but I can't do it.  So for me, it's just like do something, go work out, do whatever I need to do, sit down,  say, hey, I got two hours and I get so much more done in two hours than I did eight hours.  I agree.  I'm a little bit like that too.  Okay.  I have just a couple more questions and then I want you to show one of your websites that you built  and you can tell us, you can be one you're most proud of, the one that's the ugliest.  And I want you to tell everyone how much you're making for that website,  but a couple of quick questions.  How long did it actually take you to build your first site?  Probably took me like realistically, probably like to build it out like a month  and then to do all the other jazz, you know, it was just kind of slow.  I'd say like a month.  And working on that, that was like two hours a day.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  I already asked that question.  What do you think is the biggest reason that people don't start doing this?  So I have people all the time.  They're like, I'll have people message and again, this isn't like a ton of people,  but occasionally people will message me and say, hey man, I see what you're up to  and I'm wondering if it's something that I can do.  I'm interested.  I hate my job, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And then I like, I never hear back from them.  So I guess at some point they just like get spooked or they get sidetracked or whatever.  What do you think is the biggest reason people don't start doing this?  I think it's a fear of failing.  I really do.  I think it's like, I don't want to try something and then it's worked for us.  And so like, if it doesn't work for them, it's going to be maybe embarrassing in a way.  Like I almost just feel like it's this lack of trust in themselves.  In securities and it could be the money, but like you really can't argue with the  fact that it costs",

But to someone, I just feel like it comes down to the excuse of like,  oh, well he's got sales experience or he is Nick's brother or he's whatever.  But it's like, if you don't make it work, like it's on you.  It's not really the idea.  You know, that's what I feel like why a lot of people fail.  And a lot of people are just in their heads.  They overthink the whole thing.  And I think if you could just kind of dumb it down a little bit and just be like,  dude, you could figure this out.  It might take you a little bit longer than some of us, but like you'll figure it out.  Yeah.  What do you think is the biggest reason people fail that start doing this?  We've all, by the way, just everybody knows.  Not everybody that does this goes and makes 10K.  Not everybody does this goes.  I mean, we have extremes.  I have one guy that he started working.  We started teaching him two years ago.  He's doing $87,000 per month.  Insane.  We've also got people quarter knows.  I know that come in and every reason to succeed and then they fail.  Why do you think that is?  What's the biggest reason people fail that the ones that do start doing this?  What's the biggest reason they fail?  I think they get shiny object syndrome.  I think they, they joined the course excited.  They realized that, hey, it's, it's harder than they expected, which I think.  Yeah, it's simple, but it's not like, you know, you have to do some work.  It's not like it's, hey, as soon as you build a website, like,  no more, you don't have to ever look at it.  Like there, there's definitely some things you have to upkeep, right?  It's a business.  So there's like pullbacks and setbacks, but I think a lot of people will join  and they don't see results right away.  And so they jump ship.  They find something else and they're like, I could maybe do this like a lot faster.  When in reality, this took me two years and I'm making 10K.  That's really not that long.  Really?  When you think about it, like, I know a lot of us want to make it like  in the next two months, but it's like, I mean, I'll take it.  Obviously, I want to do a lot more than that.  But like, even if I was to do 10K every two years, I mean, I'm pretty happy.  You know, for sure.  I mean, if you're comparing that to like a job,  let's say you're out of school and you're, let's say your entry level  position is 10K a month, which means you have a really good degree  and you're probably living in a city that you may or may not want to live in.  And your costs are probably really expensive.  You're definitely not doing 10K a month working at a job  in Peru and Utah.  That's just for sure.  Yeah.  But let's say you do, like, for you to get to 20K, for you to double your income  is almost impossible.  If you do, it's going to take you 10 years kissing a lot of butt,  shaking hands, going to all the meetings, not pissing",

So here's what I want to do, finish your thought and I've got two things  I want to do, we'll end this live and then if anyone has questions.  No, I was just going to say, I think that if you guys actually had a desire  to start a business, I think if you guys really checked all the boxes  that you guys want in a business, I think you guys would really realize  that this could work for literally anybody.  We have people that do this that are firemen that are, I mean, I'm farming.  Police officers, like whatever you can, you can possibly name it.  That's what's cool is I get it.  You get to rub shoulders with people that, you know, wouldn't normally  rub shoulders with and that every personality out there from 80 years old,  what's our oldest person that does this?  I don't know, but like pretty old, you know, and then down to we had  a 16 year old that was landing deals.  Yeah, I mean, definitely a few in the 60s.  I think we had one guy in the 70s.  I don't know 80.  Maybe not 80, but 80 might be a little bit.  You might be over the hump at 80.  No, I'm kidding.  If you're 80 and you want to do this, I promise you I'll work with your hands  on it because that'd be a sick case study.  We start slinging this to a whole new audience.  You know what I'm saying?  No, it doesn't matter what age you are.  If you're willing to learn, it's cool.  It's doable, right?  Especially for two people coming from Parawant, Utah.  Evil waters, baby.  You know what I'm saying?  Shout out to Parawant, by the way.  It was an amazing childhood.  So I just, you know, just having fun.  So Porter, I want you to show one of your websites that you've built  with your own hands, your own money that's making you money.  And I'm going to ask you a final question as we sail off into the sunset.  It's 848 where I'm at in Dubai.  Porter's in Parawant, Utah.  What time is it there, dude?  It is 948.  948.  You're starting today.  I'm just really getting done.  So I'm going to give you co-hosts.  I want you to show one of your sites.  Okay.  Real quick.  I could even give you one that I'm building right now.  Let's show.  Do you have one that's, show, just show us the site real quick.  Go look, what's, oh, you want to give me the domain?  You want to give me the domain?  I'll log, I'll check it out.  Yeah, do Lawrencevilleconcrete.com.  Lawrencevilleconcrete.com.  Okay.  Let me see if it goes to it really quick.  Then I'll share my screen.  I can guarantee you Porter just gave you his best site.  So whatever this is, just guarantee this is the best one.  There's no way he gave us his ugliest.  Just kidding.

It's not, you know, obviously isn't a web design beauty or anything like that, but  it looks better than mine.  I'll buy a long shot.  He's got his tracking number here.  He's got his little quote form.  He's got his content.  He's actually got some really, if you, you might not know this because  you wouldn't know what to look for, but he's actually done a really sound SEO.  I can just tell with some of the stuff he has up in the heading.  I'm sorry.  In the page description up here.  But actually this is pretty solid.  So how much is this little website making you per month?  This one right here is making me 1600 per month.  $1,600 per month.  Where's Lawrenceville by the way?  Yes.  That's in, uh, it's kind of outside of Atlanta, like a little suburb.  So this is in Georgia.  Okay.  Lawrenceville concrete.  Every time that phone number rings.  Porter's bank account gets a little, gets a little dingle.  It gets a little, a little bumpy every time he's golfing.  He's on the tractor and that phone number rings.  He's getting paid.  Right.  I kind of look at this like, um, kind of like, uh, Porter, you've seen  despicable me, obviously.  So I can get these minions, dude, that are out there and they're literally  just doing work for you.  But the difference is the minions have like feelings and stuff like that.  These guys have no feelings.  They don't need holidays.  They don't need vacations.  They're just working.  You build them, you set them free.  They go make you money and you could, you could build as many as you want.  So, um, yeah, that's it guys.  Super simple.  So we got Zach, uh, Zach Porter.  Sorry, dude.  Sorry, by the way, um, sorry to call you that, bud.  I got a little confused a little later here.  No, it's okay.  What advice would you give somebody watching this right now that is  contemplating jumping into this?  And then I'm going to go to Moses got a question, but what advice would  you give somebody that's contemplating got a little toe dipped in the water  thinking about jumping in, but they're nervous for this, that, whatever reason.  What advice would you give them?  Uh, I would, I would tell them, look at your life now.  If you're happy with where you want to be great, then stay there.  But I think most of us want a little bit more out of life than,  then sometimes we put out, put out to be, I would say, if you're thinking  about doing this, I would say, do it.  I said that there's no other bit.  Maybe there is a business model, but nothing that I would be interested in,  but like, that is going to be able to make you the amount of money that you  can do with being able to do something that you love.  For example, I don't know if I could do any other business model while  in love and this passive is a work to it.  But like, you basically are checking every box that you possibly could do.  I would say, don't overthink it.  If we are literally as you do it for sure, there's plenty of people out  there that are testimonials of",

So I just, I would say, don't overthink it if I can do it.  But I don't go out there.  Yeah.  I like that.  That's good advice.  Okay, bro.  Moses said, how many customers are rent?  By the way, I know that we're getting a little choppy here.  We're about to end this, but he said, how many customers are renting the site?  That's one customer, Mozo.  So you don't, you could do this however you want.  You could rent this to multiple companies.  The way that Porter and I structure these is we work with one company per area.  So for example, I know you're in South Africa.  Let's say that you wanted to build a Johannesburg tree service site.  You would want to work with one company locally and send them all weeks.  Now you could split it up, but in my experience, working with one company,  giving them a great service is the best way to do it.  And then this follow up question said, is just one customer renting  or many renting your site Porter's website?  That is, yeah.  So one customer per website.  And there's a lot of reasons why we do that, which I can share with you.  So anyway, guys, that's all I wanted to share.  If you guys have any questions, Porter, actually, this is one thing  that Porter has been really helpful to do.  If people have questions and they just want to ask you,  do you want to just, how can they reach out to you?  Because he's been a really good, I know a bunch of people  in some of the other groups have reached out to him that we're a part of.  And he's really cool to just jump on like 15 minute call.  Do you want to drop your cell phone number and they can text you or,  and this is, this is actually your cell phone.  This isn't like a, this isn't like a trap phone, right?  No, this is my personal cell, dude.  All right.  Just checking this.  Thank you.  Sure.  But that'll keep you on your toes.  Okay.  By the way, I'll send you a $10 gift card.  If you go put him in one of those drawings in the mall  for like the Harley-Davidson, just so he gets spam and dollars for every person.  Or insurance, dude.  Put me in for that insurance marketplace.  Anyway, also, oh, I forgot to do this.  Two things.  Well, I'll just say one thing.  I have a bunch of free stuff.  I have a YouTube channel and I have a free,  I'll drop the free training really quick.  It's, it's called rentsimplesites.com.  Just to give you guys an idea, like an overview of what we do.  And then we actually just launched this rankandretire.com,  which is a community of people that are just kind of getting into this,  want to get their feet wet, but aren't quite ready to pull the trigger.  I'm like doing this for real for real.  You guys can go to rankandretire.com and I don't know if those links pull up for you.  Can you see them on your end quarter?  I don't think it works.  Can you see them in the chat?  Okay.  No.  Awesome.",

And I'm going to pull  it up on my screen right now. Guys, this is the perfect prospecting script. And at the  top, I'm just going to go through this really, really briefly so we can put this all together.  At the top, I've kind of just put this as a way to just mentally see how this works.  So the way that this was explained to me when I first got into sales, when they were teaching  me like, okay, here's the steps to a perfect approach. Here's the steps to a perfect door  approach or a perfect cold call. They described it, the managers, and I had really, really good  trainers, people that really knew their stuff. So I love sharing this stuff, but it's the sizzle  and the steak. So the sizzle is you call them, you grab their attention, you break the ice.  The steak is, hey, here's the step. Here's exactly what I'm doing, why I'm calling, the deal,  and the transition. The sizzle is grabbing their attention. So just maybe as more of a visual,  think of it as a sizzle and a steak, just like you would when you're grilling a steak. So you  got that sizzle to grab their attention. Then you got the actual, the thick of it, the steak.  And that's the way that I think about it. So I just listed here, the sizzle is to grab the  attention, break the ice, get them to ask in their head, what the hell is this guy doing?  You're getting their attention. And then the steak is the steps. Who you are, what you're doing,  what's in it for them, what's in it for you, and transition. This is one step combined,  that's the deal, but I just separated it out. So guys, the funny thing is, or not the funny thing,  but the ironic part is, this doesn't look like much. This has every step that we just covered.  The who you are, the what you're doing, the deal, and the transition all built in. So  if you guys choose, and you need to, for these first couple calls, guys, read this verbatim.  It doesn't matter. It does not matter. And if you read this verbatim, you actually will get  people on the hook. No shit. You will get people on the hook. That's how good this is. It is deadly.  Now, once you master it and you can just start speaking like a normal human, plus say these  things, you're going to be dangerous. Let's just go through this. So again, as we talked about,  first thing you're going to do is, hey, Jack, this is Nick. Do you guys do ex service? Do you  guys do patios? And again, this is going to be a slight variation of what we talked about,  the same exact concept. Do you guys do patios? Cool. Or do you guys do patios here in Little Valley?  You can combine it. Great. And then they're going to respond. Okay, great. And do you cover  this area, which we talked about? So, hey, do you guys cover Little Valley? Do you guys cover  Henderson? Do you guys cover Summerlin? Do you guys cover Norcross? A suburb of whatever, wherever  that lead is at. Do you guys cover 84790? And they're going to respond. Cool or excellent.

    "pageContent": "you guys? You can even make a joke. Can you guys actually do  something in 2022 or in 2023? Are we looking at like in a decade? I mean, this is getting crazy.  Oh yeah, yeah. No, we're a couple of months out, but we can get, we can take care of you. Okay,  cool. Okay. And so then, and you'll notice here, like I make, this is a little bit different than  what I explained, but it covers the exact same thing. And so I'm not actually going to reshoot  this. Okay. Because I want to prove a point here. It's about hitting the steps, not about having it  in the perfect order. It's about hitting the main point. So in this script, this is the script I've  been using forever. This is how I have it listed. Ironically, as I was teaching and training the  last few times I've done it, I put this at the end and I want to keep it this way because I want  to show you that it doesn't matter. You just need to hit the point. So in this script, it says we,  we, we can say, Hey, I've got this lady. I got Janet here. Janet here in Little Valley. She needs  tree service or she needs a tree removal. And I just wanted to make sure you could help them before  I wasted any of your time. Guys in the, in the last couple of videos, I mentioned this at the end.  It doesn't matter. Okay. This is just how the script is right now. Okay. And feel free to make  some tweaks to this. It fit this, fit this to your style, but realize it's just about hitting the  points. I just want to go over that. Okay. And then I put to which you will continue. And guys, I,  I left out what the business owner is going to say in return, but you can kind of just interpret  the business owner is going to say, you know, who the hell are you? What, whatever, right? Who's this  guy? Like, what are you doing? Et cetera. Oh, sorry. Like I said, my name's Nick and I have a  website and phone number here in blank city in St. George. That's getting a ton of, or getting three  to five concrete jobs every week. Notice how I said jobs, not leads. Very important to, to notice.  Okay. And then I put here I, and guys, again, you could read this verbatim. It will work. Okay.  I was planning on sending you a couple for free before I take any of your time,  but to be candid with you, I am looking to find a partner here in Austin to work on an ongoing basis  or just here in Austin. Okay. Doesn't need to be perfect. Okay. I want you guys to see that this  doesn't need to be perfect. Okay. Continuing. I noticed, and again, you can probably just guess,  Hey, I transition right there. I noticed you're already paying for Google ads. So I know you're  hungry to take on more work and figured since I already, since I already have to work, why not  just work with you directly? Guys, it's just a different order of what we already talked about.  Okay. Again, so, and then you can imagine the business was going to respond. So let me send  you this lady. Let me send you Janet real quick, maybe one or two more. And then all I ask in return  is a conversation in a couple of days. How does that sound? Is that cool? Same thing, right? Just  in a little bit different order.",

And I even said right here, that's it. Do not discuss, in fact, I'm going to put asterisks  by this. Do not discuss price. Do not tell them you were looking to do a flat fee contract, blah,  blah, blah. You will lose the deal. We talked about this at the beginning when I said, do not,  you're selling dinner. You're not selling marriage. Okay. If they ask repeatedly,  and this is one thing I want to point out. Okay. And one thing too, I want to just add into this is  we need to add transition. Okay. Let me grab. What's the best email and phone number to send leads to  explain. By the way, I'm doing this real time. So you let's, I don't even, I hope this isn't  even getting edited out. I want to keep this in. Okay. Explain the live transfer  and then pull back if necessary. Okay. There's a couple of things I want to add. Okay. Last  thing I want to mention on this, cause guys, that's it. There's nothing else to talk about.  If you need to read the damn script, read the damn script, this will work. This is like,  this is why I call it the perfect prospecting trip. Read this shit word for word. It'll work.  Read it word for word. It will work if you need to master it, learn it, put it in your brain,  and then say it as you would say it. And you're going to be a deadly human being. You're going  to be a savage salesperson. Okay. You're going to be hooking people freaking left and right. Like  you're using some illegal substance. Like they do out on the, on the lakes where you use corn,  or where you use like WD or DW, whatever that stuff 40, where you spray it on totally illegal,  but it works like a charm. That's going to be you. Okay. Last point is this. Okay.  If they ask repeatedly about price, which they can and sometimes will, I mentioned here,  and I said this at the beginning, just push it off till the end. Hey, look, I'm not actually  worried about that. I do all kinds of different deals. Like honestly, that's the, that's the  wrong question. We're putting the cart before the horse. Let me get you a couple of jobs  before we even get to that. Okay. And if they keep going to like, Oh, just give me a ballpark.  Here's my response. Okay. To be honest, I have, I have somebody right now that's paying me around  three to $400 per month. And I also have a company that's paying me $50,000 per month. So it's going  to be somewhere in there. No, but seriously, that's not that like we'll, we'll work something out.  Don't worry about that. Okay. And we're just, we're just kind of, we're just saying, Hey, look,  it's going to be, it's too hard to tell at this point. Stop asking that question. Okay. But if you  need to satisfy them, cause they keep asking, I like to use that. And that's true. Hey, I got  somebody paying three, $400 bucks and I got somebody paying me $50,000. I definitely can tell you  you're going to be way closer to the bottom than the",

And back into it, back into the process, right? That's what's cool about  having a process. You have your steps and your transition. And if you deviate and start asking  questions outside of that, you can answer it and come right back to where you were at. If you, if  they cut you off in the middle of explaining the deal, cool. Answer it. Come right back. Like I was  saying, I want to give you a couple of free leads. Let's talk in a couple of days. Why don't I just  give you the leads in exchange for, we work something out. I mean, I don't know about you,  but unless you have some kind of a romantic relationship with Google or Larry Page or  Sergey Brin, I don't like, I would love to work with someone local. And I'm sure you would too.  Okay. Just address it. But the point is, and I mentioned this at the first, don't sell marriage,  sell them. Okay. Guys, that's it. This is the script. This script has been working like a charm  for me for years and years and years. And yeah, I had a couple of tweaks. You guys just saw me real  time. Add a couple little tweaks. Okay. The important part is that we hit the steps necessary.  And just to recap who you, first of all, the sizzle, okay. Pattern interrupt who you are,  what you're doing, which is a damn good reason why you're calling. Okay. And I like to make sure  that you remember that the deal, what's in it for them, what's in it for you, stressing more on  what's in it for you and the transition and drop in a pullback when necessary.

I prefer to stick with one business owner because again, remember what I said to  Jean or yeah, to Jeannie said, talk about retention, which by the way, Eugene or sorry,  Jean, your issue, you need to get these guys in a contract.  I think that's going to solve a lot of problems because if they're month to month,  there's no commitment. There is zero commitment. Okay.  I do a six month contract and it's a 30 day notice of cancellation type of thing.  So it's like, yeah. So Rudy, I don't like sharing them with other people.  I like to give them to one company because again, it comes back to this.  If I can get a business owner to make money,  I know I'm going to close that business owner. Like I better close that business owner.  So I prefer to just give two or three leads to one person and just focus on that one person.  What I found is when you start sharing the leads, like this guy gets it,  this guy gets it, this guy gets it, and you kind of do the round robin,  the lead gets overwhelmed. The lead's like, what is this? They're confused.  And the person that closes the job might not be the person that you want to work with.  So I like to just find the person I want to work with, hook them up,  make them money and make it work. Okay. That's just my two cents. You can.  I've done it not on purpose.

Luke, make sure that you let them know, because that's an objection,  right? Every objection that you're going to get, you want to, you want to eliminate it in the setup  and the setup. Part of the setup is the screencast. Part of the setup is getting on the phone with a  business owner. Sometimes I bring it up on the phone call before. I sometimes bring it on the  screencast. Sometimes I bring it up on both, right? But if I'm getting that every single time,  I'm definitely bringing that up. And I'm going to construct it in a way that doesn't feel like  I'm going to force them to do it, even though I am going to. And then if when push comes to shove,  we get to the call and they start telling me, Hey, I need to think about it. No, no, no,  I told you it's not, we wrote, man. You, you heard me. I told you on the phone. I told you  on the screencast, we don't do that. So, and then I'm going to hear them out, but I'm going to,  at the end of the day, I'm going to hold them to the fact they got in this call, knowing that I  don't do that. That's all I asked them and they agreed. And I'm going to get a decision. If they  say they want to think about it still, I'm going to say it's a no, I'm not going to let you think  about it.

Don't worry, you're not stuck with me for the next hour.  Can you guys let me know if you can hear me?  I'm trying to get Facebook on my phone, but should be able to hear me.  Let's see.  All right, so see we got a couple people on.  Can you guys hear me?  Make sure I can't hear myself.  Nick's going to be on in just a few minutes.  He is on his way to the office.  So just hang tight real quick.  Thank you, Aaron Smith.  Appreciate that, bro.  Coming in loud and clear.  All right.  And dude, Aaron, I think, aren't you, didn't you just join?  I think I saw your post on digital landlords.  That's awesome, bro.  I'm super excited to have you.  How this normally works is Nick will just go live here at 7 a.m. MST.  But again, he just asked me real quick to jump in  because he's going to be a few minutes late on the way to the office.  But we're going to get this thing rolling.  It's going to be a fun topic.  It's going to be talking about second money.  And what's cool about that is some people might be like, well, I got a first.  Let's see, Stephanie says there's no link.  Stephanie, are you talking about our group message with like Kyle and fix it?  Or I'm not sure what you mean by there's no link.  I did message you, by the way, in our group chat.  But Matthew says, I hear you, Aaron.  Nice to be here.  Yes.  Thank you, Matthew.  Nice to be here as well.  I just sent Nick the zoom link, so we're going to get this thing rolling.  And again, we're going to be talking about second money.  And what's cool about second money is that even if you're still working on that first deal,  anytime you're learning about sales or just like business principles  or just pricing structure in general,  it seems like can be so applicable to just every aspect of whatever stage you're in in business.  So I'm looking forward to talking about it.  And so we're getting a few more people on.  Just as a quick recap, guys, Nick's going to be on in a few minutes.  So hang tight with me real quick.  And we're going to get this thing rolling.  Let me check my messages from him.  Awesome.  He says he's going to be there in a few minutes.  So while we're waiting, I don't want to have dead air.  I can do a quick little story of the Daniel says good morning.  Good morning, Daniel.  Good to see you, brother.  So again, we're just waiting for Nick right now.  He's going to be on soon.  But so as of right now, I don't have any active deals.  That's like 100% on me.  Like I've closed deals in the past.  I've done a complete A to Z on my own.  And then with winter, because it was in Michigan,  and we had to put a pause on it. ",

    "pageContent": "Anyway, that said, I've had deals.  And looking back on it, it's so important to qualify your business owners  because you can waste a lot of time.  Oh, Stephanie says, I thought this was a Zoom, but I hear you.  Yeah, I know this is just going to be the live.  I mean, if Nick has time, I know we've done this in the past,  but I'm like bring people on for Q&A, like onto the Zoom.  So we can actually see.  We'll probably be a little short on time today.  We can even see about starting to do that at the end of each live call each week.  Anyway, so what happened was when you're calling these business owners,  I would usually come from the perspective or the mindset.  I'm inconveniencing them.  I'm asking them, please take my leads.  And that's just the wrong way to approach it  because we're the one who's actually delivering the value.  And so this was like a year ago when I was still pretty insecure  about all this stuff didn't like sales, that much didn't know what I was doing.  I mean, I knew what I was doing, but just didn't have much experience.  So I called this guy.  It's his Hispanic dude, right?  And he was like, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.  He was super excited as he should be.  It's free leads.  And so I don't ask him any questions though,  because I'm afraid to lose the deal.  I mean, looking back on it, it's absolutely ridiculous, right?  You should be asking like, hey, man, I'm happy to give you a couple of free leads,  but just to make sure I don't want to waste your time or my time.  Can I ask a couple of quick questions just to make sure this is going to be a good fit, right?  And so again, that's when it talks about the pullback, right?  And so I'm just reliving this in my mind.  Bottom line is I send this guy a couple of leads.  We go to hop on the Zoom call.  And by the way, for the few of you that just jumped on,  Nick's going to be on in a few minutes.  He's on his way to the office.  Anyway, I've sent this guy a few concrete leads at this point, right?  They're good leads.  I've live transferred them.  He goes, we have a Zoom call scheduled.  I start the Zoom.  I'm excited.  I'm ready to do this thing.  He doesn't show.  I text him.  I don't hear anything back.  Few hours later, this was scheduled for the morning.  He texts, sorry, bro.  I was late at a party last night with my brother and I slept in.  So that's a bit of a red flag, right?  Anyway, like, okay, whatever.  And I didn't like do anything to like do a pullback or whatever.  I was just like totally getting walked all over.  And I was like, okay, well, we can do it tomorrow or whatever when we schedule it.  So we go to schedule it.  And I had prefaced this when we, the day before, said, by the way, bro,  if you could be at your desktop or laptop, that'd be great.  In case I need to share my screen, it'll just help the call to go by faster, right?  So he's like, oh yeah, that sounds great.  So we have the scheduled Zoom call.  The dude shows up on his phone at",

We're here to do business or whatever, something, right?  Because he just did exactly the opposite of what I asked him to do, right?  Plus I need to share my screen, like that's a real thing.

He's just stringing me along the whole time, right?  Go to find out.  This is where prospecting qualifying comes in.  The guy is, it was actually, it was crazy.  I go to hop on, turns out he, he doesn't have a green card.  So he's an illegal alien.  And like, I was like 16 at this point.  And so it was actually kind of funny because I was kind of like freaking out internally,  like, oh my goodness, am I going to get in trouble for doing business with like whatever?  Like, you know what I'm saying, right?  And so bottom line is I just kind of looked past that still see if we can make something work.  So I go to drop price and what do you know?  Boom, he's out.  I was going to charge like a thousand bucks a month.  And we were getting like, if I remember, it was like at least 12 to 15 leads a month.  What a nightmare.  If I was one year younger, I probably would have started crying.  And yes, Eman, that is the proper emoji for that.  So the moral of the story is to qualify these people, right?  Now there is a little trick.  Like if you ask too many questions on the cold call, it does seem like you will lose them.  But what I found to be helpful is that when you hop on the cold call,  depending on where they're at, it can be helpful to send them one lead to just like,  so you show you're legit and then they're interested in that and be like,  hey man, I'm happy to send you a few more.  But hey, let's hop on a quick like chat today or tomorrow or whatever.  And just so we can learn more about each other, right?  In case we just want to see if this is a good fit, right?  So then you're giving them permission to learn more about you.  That way they're not scared of like, who is this guy and have zero dollars.  Like we can be transparent with them, right?  And then vice versa, right?  So, oh, Eman says, just call me E homie.  Thanks, bro.  Appreciate it, Eve.  Um, yeah, dude.  Um, anyway, so let's see.  Like it's a few minutes late, but anyway, that's it guys.  Qualify these people.  We're the ones who bringing, like we are looking for a win-win partnership, right?  But we're the ones who are bringing the value to the table, right?  And so it's really important not to get walked over by these business owners.  I've lost a lot of deals from that.  It's taken me a lot than that.  Yeah.  Anyway, so prospecting is a really big one.  And I guess",

    "pageContent": "the biggest thing is like, just don't be scared to lose the deal.  Number one, you probably won't.  Number two, if you do, they probably aren't a good fit anyway.  As long as obviously you don't be like super like interrogation style with it.  But Jason, good morning.  Glad to have you here, bro.  Let's see.  Nick should be on moment Tito.  Sorry about this guys.  Oh, thanks, Mahmood.  Yeah, man.  Um, hope that call goes well, bro.  If you put in reps, I know you're crushing it.  That's really cool to see all the lives you're doing in the group.  So, yeah, that was probably like the worst sales experience.  Um, yeah, that was pretty crazy.  Um, all right.  So, okay, well, may as well.  May as well relive another sales story.  And what's really cool about this though, guys, is when we look at the sales process,  obviously when, when dealing with people, there's always variables, right?  Just with responses and this or that or triggers or whatever.  Right.  But there is like when Jordan, love him or hate him.  When Jordan Belfort says like every sale is the same, there is a truth to that.  Right.  Like when we look at the sales process that we have, it is a straight line.  Right.  And so all we gotta do is like check these boxes.  And it is really like, think talks about in the modules, baking the cake.  When we add these ingredients, 99% of the time, we should get a cake out the other side.  Right.  And so what's really cool about that is usually in sales, it can feel super overwhelming.  But for us, all we gotta do is just make enough cold calls to get someone on the hook.  Right.  All we gotta do is just live transfer enough leads to get them ready for the zoom call.  And then all we gotta do is the zoom call.  It really is like a three-step sales process.  Right.  It is the prospecting, the setup, and the close.  And so what's so cool about that is some of us are better than others at different parts.  Like I was really bad at all three.  I've gotten a little better at the closing.  But I still need to get better at the prospecting and the setup.  Right.  And qualifying these business owners and just not getting so nervous and all that.  Right.  But what's so cool about that is once we check off all the boxes, that's when it does become  a machine.  Right.  And that's when we can put in the certain inputs to get the outputs.  And that's when we can predictably grow our business.  Right.  So that's the state I'm in right now.  And by the way, for the few of you that just hopped on, Nick's gonna be on any minute.  Hang tight.  I have texted him the zoom link.  He's gonna be on soon.  So anyway, it's funny.  Like a lot of the, it seems like with this group, the main issues isn't, most people  struggle with the sales in this business.  Right.  Like so many people know how to rank a website or get leads.  But a lot of people just struggle with converting that to specifically flat fee deals.  Because that's really where you scale.  I mean, you can make money with commission and pay per lead, but there's just so much  maintenance per client.  It's really not, it's really difficult to scale",

    "pageContent": "that way.  But I was going to say the biggest issues, it seems like even me personally is just on  the tech side with getting Google ad set, getting the due diligence, which is actually  kind of cool to some degree, because once we get those things dialed in, then for our  personal agencies, it is just so much easier to scale because we have just the sales process  works.  Right.  And so I'm excited to be getting back into things.  I actually got another lead yesterday for my ad campaign.  So I need to be live transferring that over.  And so yeah, guys, it's a good business.  Like I was actually on a zoom with Jason Oliver the other day.  And it seems like a helpful perspective when looking at this is to look at it as somewhat  of a game, right?  Not that we want to be cavalier, irresponsible about it.  But when we look at it as a game, it seems like, for me at least, it helps me to kind  of like lower the emotional, like tension or anxiety or whatever, and just like look  at this as a game again.  Moving pieces like, OK, I got to check these six boxes.  What's the one thing that's holding me up?  OK, I need the ads are holding me up or whatever.  Or like, OK, I just can't get someone on the hook.  Right.  And so whatever it is, that is the dragon to slay at that moment.  Right.  And so Nick just said he's getting on now.  So anyway, guys, I'm just excited to be getting back with things.  And I mean, if it takes me a year to land a couple deals, the amount of progress you  can make in a three month period in this business once the processes are dialed in  makes it so worth it.  And so just because it's going slow now or for me like, man, a couple of months.  And to be fair, I really haven't been taking the action I should.  So that's on my end.  But again, just like looking at long picture, like a six month sprint, you guys have no  idea.  Like the people that are making like 10k plus a month in this business, a lot of them  got there really fast once they kind of got through the weeds or got through the mud  of the first couple of months or whatever.  Like I know that's what happened with Jason.  And I mean, obviously, we've all seen Ryan Dalton and his insane scaling in just a few  short year or two.  So Nick is stopping on now.  All right.  Aaron, can you hear me?  I can hear you.  Let's see.  Can you hear me?  Yeah.  Let me try the mic.  Hold on.  How about now?  I can hear you.  Yeah, you're good.  Everyone, can you hear Nick?  You should be able to.  Let me know as soon as you can hear me.  I'm gonna pull up my notes.  Yeah, yesterday, my mic wasn't working.  I don't know what's going on, but good to hear.  Yeah.  Awesome.  They say that they can hear you loud and clear, which is great.  Let me see if I get my camera.  Let me check on Facebook.  I'm not seeing your screen on my screen.  It might just be the.  Oh, no, hold on.  There we go.  Can you see me now?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  So not to cut anyone off.  Are you recording?  Not yet.  Here we go.  Amazing. ",

Just reliving some sales deals and all that.  Beautiful.  Okay.  Well, that said, guys, welcome to the call.  If this is your first call, then just know we're going to be doing this forever.  You're going to see this call at this time forever.  I know it's a tiny bit early for some,  but it's the best possible time we can do to get as many people as possible.  So, Aaron, are you going to be able to stay on for this call?  Yeah.  Okay.  So real quick, before we get started, did you talk about the podcast?  Not yet.  I'm just going to leave that to you.  All right.  So, guys, we decided that it would be beneficial for...  I would say it's a bit selfish as well,  but we decided that it would be a good idea to do not the classic,  let me interview the random people in my town who are nobodies  and let me have interviews with people that are not interesting.  That's really bad.  I hate those.  We decided that there's so many nuanced things to this business model  that it would be a good idea to just have an entire podcast,  entire series, an entire show dedicated towards every single nuance  and every single facet of this business.  So we have launched the Digital Real Estate Secrets podcast.  It's just basically 100% all things this business model.  We're going to be talking about everything that you could think of,  every single angle, whatever of this model.  Obviously, we're not going to be teaching what we teach in the program,  so don't think that that's going to be the same material  or that we're going to replace or we're going to be talking about that,  but we are going to be talking about high-level stuff.  There may be some interviews-style stuff  where we bring on guests that are in the space,  but for those of you that want to check that out,  you're going to see a new episode every single week.  So, Aaron, I actually have the link.  Let me go ahead.  Hold on.  Let me see.  This will work.  You can still hear me, right?  Yeah, you're good.  Okay, let me just make sure this is going to work here.  By the way, while you pull that up, just a little shout out to Adair,  locked in a 2,000 a month, six-month contract just this week.  Okay.  Making moves.  A little $12,000, not a bad gig.  I like that a lot.  Okay, let me see if I can get this going.  All right.  Hold on.  By the way, I see a few new faces  that look like this is their first call,  so welcome to the call.  But anyway, congrats on the deal, Adair, by the way.  That's what this is all about.  It's getting that first deal.  That's the most important deal,  and then getting the next, and the next, and the next, and the next.  So anyway, guys, check that out.  Appreciate you guys, if you want to check that out,  great if not, no big deal.  But I may be asking some of you guys to come on,  share your experience, share some of your tips, strategies, et cetera.  So if we reach out, that would be super, super",

I'm warning we can't talk about that though, but...  No, no, no, no, no, no problem.  That's fine.  That's completely fine.  So last thing real quick, and then let's get started.  I want to give away some stuff, dude.  Let's give away a few things really quick.  Aaron, I'm going to have you choose...  So for those of you that don't know,  we just have some items that we put together that you guys can use every day.  We have these mouse pads.  We have an AirPod case.  We have a coffee mug.  We have a...  What am I missing?  AirPod case, coffee mug.  What's the last one?  Besides the shirts.  The...  Is that it?  Mouse pad, AirPod case.  I think that's main four.  Well, what am I missing, bro?  The mouse pad, the coffee mug, the AirPod case.  There's a fourth one, I thought.  And the shirt, yeah, those four.  Okay, I thought there's another one.  I could be crazy.  Bro, are you sure?  Shopdigitalandlords.com, I guess we can take it.  Yeah, let's look, dude.  But while you're doing that, just keep the ball rolling.  I will just have to give it to Aaron Smith.  It looks like this is his first call in the game.  So congrats, bro.  Good to have you back.  Jared Bell says, Fanny Pack.  Gotta talk to Ashley and get back.  It's the sticker, bro.  Oh, I gotcha.  Yeah, yeah, okay.  So Aaron, what am I gonna have you do?  I'm gonna go turn on my AC because I seem to forget every single time.  Will you go ahead?  I want you to choose, let's just say five winners.  I want you to give away, or four winners.  I want to have you give away a sticker, an AirPod case, a mug,  and a mouse pad really quick.  And then let's get this call rolling.  Okay, so real quick, let's just see.  You know what we'll do is, I'm not sure what you guys want.  So we'll say, Aaron, you can just message,  message fix it Felix in the group.  And he'll hook you up with getting you a promo code for the merch store.  So Aaron Smith, you got it.  Let me just quickly reply.  We'll say, and then we'll get this ball rolling with, again, 2D.  Usually the intros don't take this long, by the way, guys.  We had a few hangups with getting the call going, but it's all good.  So we'll say, message fix it for your swag.  Your swag.  Okay, congrats, Aaron Smith.  We'll say, Matthew, you're always here, bro.  Let's give you something.  Matthew Torres?  Yep.  Yeah, he's always showing up.  I like that.

We appreciate people that have the can do,  I'm going to make it work attitude,  not everyone else's fault that I'm not making a million dollars a second.  Yeah, that makes sense.  Nick, it might be a little late.  If you do want to do the everyone tag,  you have to do it on your mobile phone, I guess.  So I can't because I'm not logged in.  I'm not even, I'll download Facebook on my phone,  but you know me, man, I'm like a drug addict.  I have to take everything off my phone or I just spend all my time on it.  I'll tag everyone as soon as it downloads.  Did we give away four?  We did do four.  Yep.  So I just messaged the winners.  Let's get this thing going.  Okay, guys, today we're going to be talking about the truth about second money.  I get a little bit fired up about this topic  because I felt like I was given misinformation.  And so I am excited to talk about this.  And I'm also excited for Aaron to give his feedback as well.  So let me go ahead.  I'm almost logged in now.  I may as well just go ahead and finish this off.  Hold on.  Let's see.  Okay, we're in the world groups.  By the way, guys, life hack, if you want to get stuff done,  just to get social media off your freaking phone,  I promise you guys, even if you don't think it helps,  just not just knowing you can't,  you don't even have the ability to click on the stupid app  is enough that I swear to you, it gives you superpowers.  So what I try to do now, I fail weekly at this  because I'll download it to post and then I'll leave it on like an idiot.  But I just try not to keep the apps on my phone.  And it's amazing that you start to use your brain.  You start to think creatively.  You start to have real conversations.  You start to plan.  And I think social media is such a powerful tool.  I'm never going to be the guy that's like, don't use it, don't be on it.  I think that's stupid, too, because you need to use it.  I've made a lot of money from social media.  I'm going to make a lot more money.  I think you should be building a brand and an audience.  However, I think that you should be like,  hey, if I'm going to be on social media, I'm producing.  I'm putting out content.  I'm creating networking opportunities, et cetera.  To sit there and scroll.  And again, I fail every week, so I'm not saying I'm perfect,  but it has been a huge deal to just delete it off my phone.  So that said, guys, second money.  Aaron, I'm curious.  When I say second money, what do I mean?  Do you have any idea what I'm talking about,  what I'm saying with second money?  I'm assuming you're saying something to the effect of an upsell  or selling a current customer more.  Correct.  So when I say second money, I'm talking about  you have a client and you go and you get a second money from them,  a third money, a fourth money, a fifth money.  They're already your client and you're going to go get money.  Now, guys, I want to",

    "pageContent": "tell you that the idea and the theory of second money,  it sounds so genius on paper.  It makes all the sense in the world, right?  Because they say getting a new client is the hardest part.  I don't know who's they.  I don't know where it's said, but I've heard that many times.  The hardest thing to do is get a new client.  The most expensive thing to do is get a new client.  So in theory, taking a current client and just selling them something else,  getting another chunk of money makes total sense.  And it's kind of like paper lead, right?  For those of you that are brand new to this group,  we hear about, you know, I always talk about how much I dislike paper lead.  And some of you guys are like, well, why?  You know, you get paid according to how many leads you produce and blah, blah, blah.  And I'm telling you guys on paper, paper lead sounds so good,  but in theory and practice, it doesn't work.  And I'm telling you guys on paper and in theory,  second money sounds amazing, but in practice, that's not how it works.  So long story short, guys, is like, I think it was back in 2000.  I don't know.  It was early in my career doing this.  It was like 2018, 2019.  I was in part of...  Actually, let me back up just a little bit.  Let me give you guys really quick the game plan of what we're going to be discussing today.  And I'll start by saying that my goal with this live,  my goal with this training is that by the end of this live,  I want to basically expose to you the truth about second money, okay?  And give you guys enough information to show you that it's not exactly how it appears  and you need to consider all the costs before just going and focusing on it or asking for it, okay?  So here's kind of the things I'm going to cover today.  I'm going to be talking about this theory of second money and how genius it sounds on paper.  I'm going to be talking about why I decided to try it, okay?  And what I learned from it.  Then I'm going to be talking about my experience and how it went.  Then I'm going to be talking about what happened when I stopped doing it.  Then I'm going to be talking about how I actually tried to do it again  after I did it the first time.  Then how to properly...  Sorry.  Yeah, you know, how to properly do second money  because there is a proper way, I believe.  Then I'm going to share a friend's story with second money  and then I'm going to give you guys a challenge, okay?  So that's kind of going to be what we're going to cover.  I'll get through it pretty quick and then if we have questions,  we're going to get through those at the end as well.  So basically the theory of second money is you have a client, you go ask them for more money.  You have a lead gen client, you go ask them to do their SEO with you.  You have a lead gen client, you go ask them to go and use your white labeled software  that you're doing with go high level.  You have a client, you ask them to manage their Facebook account where you post every...  And guys, Aaron, doesn't it make perfect sense?  Literally on paper, it's like we don't have to go call.  We don't have to go cultivate any new relationships.  We just get new business. ",

    "pageContent": "We just get new money from current clients.  Am I wrong or does that not sound attractive to you?  It's attractive.  Have you tried it?  I have not.  To be fair, I haven't had that many customers to test it on, but I still hopefully wouldn't  because I know what you're going to say.  I believe it.  So I just want to say this and just real quick before we get into why I decided to try it.  Guys, going for second money, third money, fourth money, fifth money,  any money outside of your original lead gen money before you are printing  money with your first money.  Okay.  Obviously, if you're in this group, you should be focusing on lead generation.  Now, I know some of you guys are in a situation where you need to get some cash coming in  so you can quit your job, in which case I think the best way to do that is to do SEO,  just FYI.  And that's why if you guys heard me bring in Zach Powell, he has a really good process  for getting SEO clients and getting that.  But that should just be to quit your job.  And if you don't need to quit your job immediately or you have enough money,  I just think the long-term strategy, it's so much easier to just build a business  where you quit your job on lead gen money because I was in a position  where I didn't have money coming in.  I had to go and do SEO and it's very easy to get sucked down the SEO trap.  As sexy as it sounds, it's not scalable and it doesn't have the longevity that lead gen does.  There's just, I don't care how you set it up, it's just not the same.  But you guys are shooting yourself in the foot.  You guys are crazy.  If you guys are trying to go for second, third, fourth money  before you are printing money with your first money,  before you have your entire process automated and dialed in to the point  where you don't even have to be involved.  Because guys, what ends up happening is like this second money concept,  you know, it's actually the same as starting another business.  It's actually the same as distracting yourself with a completely separate business,  but it disguises itself as a complimentary service.  And I'm going to get into my experience doing it,  but I'm just going to start and tell you upfront that splitting your attention,  splitting your focus is so detrimental to growing your business.  It's insane and sometimes you don't even recognize it  because you won't see it immediately, but it's taxing to your bandwidth,  it's taxing to your focus.  And it's going to be the death of you.  It's going to come at the expense of you hitting your goal, okay?  So anything that I say for, I'm going to use the term second money,  but it goes for third, fourth, fifth, sixth money, right?  Second money would be like SEO.  Third money would be like social media management.  Fourth money would be like white label software.  Fifth money could be doing swag, you know, I don't know what I'm on,  sixth, seventh could be consulting.  I mean, there's so many different layers to this because again,  the theory is businesses spend money on all these different things.  Let's go and get as many pieces of the pie as we possibly can.  And again, we look at some of these examples like a Warren Buffett, right?  And Warren Buffett, I think they said when you go and buy something at the store,  he's making money on the credit card.  He's making money",

    "pageContent": "on the Coke.  He's making money on like four or five different things.  And so we want to sit there.  We want to mimic people like Warren Buffett, but we forget that Warren Buffett,  he made his initial money by focusing on one thing.  And then he's now diversified into how many income streams.  So we confuse that when we hear we need seven income streams.  No, you need one to get rich and you need to then diversify to keep your money  and to grow your money.  But you need one and you should focus on one to get that initial capital, okay?  So again, guys, I want you to know that I understand that the theory of second money  sounds sexy.  It sounds fun.  It sounds like, hey, I've got 10 clients.  Like for example, Adair, I know he's gotten three, four, five deals  because I've announced all of them.  And congratulations, by the way, bro, that's no small feat.  But it becomes very attractive to stop doing what we know works because it's hard.  It's hard to go find new areas.  It's hard to pick up the phone and do another cold call.  It's hard to go and set up another ad campaign.  And it sounds amazing to take our five clients or seven clients or 10 or 20 clients  and say, hey, bro, hey, Joe, I'm going to do your SEO.  It sounds very, very, very attractive.  And I'm probably going against things I've said in the past.  But that's the beauty of business is that I'm evolving and I'm growing.  And maybe I'll even talk about this on the podcast this week or next week.  But this is from experience.  And that's the thing that I can sit here and tell you with conviction is that  I've tried this and I've tried it multiple times.  And this is how it works.  So guys, I'm going to tell you now why I decided to try it  and then what I learned from it.  So again, back in like 2000, I think 17, 18, 19, somewhere in there,  somebody that I was in another group, I was in multiple groups,  but I was the course guy.  I bought so many programs.  I think I spent around 23,000.  They have calculated 23 to 30,000 somewhere in there.  That's only on rank and rent programs.  That's only on marketing.  That doesn't include any type of like one-on-one coaching or whatever.  This is just with rank and rent specific marketing programs.  And there was a piece of advice that I got from somebody in one of these programs.  And that was that I was a fool for not going for second, third, fourth money.  And the thing that tricked me, the thing that confused me is this person  actually does make a lot of money.  They just don't make a lot of money doing this.  They just don't make a lot.  And they never did.  And that's the thing that we need to distinguish, guys,  is that there's a lot of people out there that are making money  by teaching things and not doing the thing that they teach.  That's basically every other person out there teaching rank and rent  because I know all of them.  There's an exception or two.  But majority of them, they made $10,000 one time  and they decided, hey, I'm going to throw together a program  and I'm going to teach people how to do this, which is cool.  That's great.  But how do you coach somebody past your skill level?  I",

And so be very careful because I know some of you guys  are in other groups.  Some of you guys are in multiple groups  and especially those of you that are in free groups.  I see you.  I see some of you guys pouring yourself out  and jumping at every single free piece of information, free PDF.  It's from some no name in a group.  If they're in the model, you don't even know if it's a human.  You don't even know if they even know what money is.  You don't know any of this stuff.  And I see you guys getting all these free things.  And guys, just because something's free  doesn't mean you should take it.  I had a dog took a freaking dump in my front yard.  That cost me no dollars.  I'm not going to keep the dung and sprinkle it on my garden.  It was free.  I was so pissed.  By the way, Aaron, I know you have dogs, right?  We doubt.  I thought you had a dog.  OK.  So I was going to make this announcement.  Maybe you guys could tell me.  I was so pissed yesterday.  We brought the boat in and I saw three piles of shit.  And I'm sorry because I wasn't going to curse.  But I saw three piles of shit on my front yard, right?  Is this on the artificial grass?  On my artificial grass, paid for by Dre, by the way.  But on my artificial grass, thank goodness  it was artificial grass.  I could spray it off.  But I swear to you, I have a Facebook group in my community  and I'm going to put on there.  And if you guys love dogs, you could be offended.  I don't care.  I'm going to take a picture of all three piles.  And I'm going to post it on our community group and say,  we just installed new cameras.  If I catch your dog taking a shit on my front yard,  you could pick it up at the crematory.  Ha ha ha ha ha in an ash box.  OK.  So don't eat shit on my front yard.  Anyway, just because it's free does not mean that you guys  should actually take it.  OK.  So I listen to this guy.  He gave me free advice and the dude makes a lot of money.  But he doesn't make it doing this.  That's the whole point of this conversation is that, guys,  if they don't make money doing this, why are you listening to it?  OK.  Why are you listening to it?  Dave Ramsey, perfect example.  Everybody listens to Dave Ramsey.  Dave Ramsey does not make his money by following his own advice.  That's the irony behind good old Dave and his program and his radio show.  He does not make money doing what he preaches.  So I don't know how that guy goes to bed at night.  It would feel really weird to me to be making a lot of money  and have never made a million dollars.  That's why I just shake my head at people that are like,  I'm going to start a program.  Good.  That's your choice.  Good luck.  OK.  Anyway, I decided to give this a try.  And the mistake that I made, guys,  is that I followed somebody's advice that wasn't in the game.  I followed somebody's advice that was making money  by doing something",

    "pageContent": "different than what they were talking about.  And so that's the biggest thing that I learned, guys,  is that you have like the number one thing I learned,  apart from the fact that it's not a good idea,  is that it taught me that I can't listen to anything  that this person is saying past $10,000 a month,  because I think this person had made like $24,000  in one month or two months,  but they hadn't made anything past that.  And so that was the biggest thing it taught me,  is that just because the thing that they're teaching me  worked for them in this other business,  it's not necessarily applicable to this business.  And so I want you guys to remember  that if nothing else inside this group, guys,  I've been to the place that you guys like so far,  no one has passed where I got to.  I got to $124,000 per month.  I do not know anyone that has gotten to that point.  And I know I see people on social media  talking about making $140,000.  And dude, in fact, there's a couple of brothers right now,  they live in my hometown,  and they have a program apparently, okay?  Never heard of these guys, never heard of them.  And they're posting about making $140,000.  So they watch all of my stories.  They follow me, they have for years.  And I've tried to reach out to them a couple of times  to just have a conversation  because I think that they're a scam.  So I'd messaged them literally the other day.  And I was like, hey guys, Nick here.  Love to hop on the phone and chat  and see what you guys got going on  since we're in the same town.  This is my second message.  And it says active like four minutes ago.  These guys don't read my message.  So I just messaged them like, hey, it's ironic  that you guys watch all my stories.  You guys are fanboys, but you can't,  you're pretending not to see my message.  Anyway, long story short,  these guys aren't making $140,000.  I promise you that.  I posted my tax returns inside the free group, okay?  My tax returns are inside the free group  for those of you that doubt the money that I've made.  Because it really bothered me  and does bother me when people just make false claims.  So that's the biggest thing that I learned  and that's what I want you guys to take away  is it drives me nuts when I see you guys commenting  inside of these other Facebook groups  and inside these other programs that I'm also a part of.  And you guys are just getting free stuff.  I just got an email today from another rank and rank group.  It's a program that I bought.  It's a friend of mine.  And he's like promoting this.  The dude doesn't make any money on this stuff, okay?  So just freaking listen to people that you are like,  if they haven't been somewhere you want to go  and stop listening to them.  So anyway, that's why I decided to try it  and that's what I learned, okay?  Now, let me tell you about my experience.  When I did this, when I implemented this,  what ended up happening is first and foremost,  I became very relieved.  Because I remember sitting there thinking,  wow, I hate cold calling people.  And yeah, I've made it to this point,  but I don't like to call people.  And if I didn't imagine,  if I",

Even to this day for me to pick up this phone  and call strangers, it's still uncomfortable.  It's always gonna be uncomfortable  because it's always easier to talk to people  that you know, right?  And so I remembered my initial reaction to this is like,  I had a big sense of relief because I was like,  oh my gosh, this is gonna be so nice.  I'm not gonna have to talk to anybody new.  I'm gonna take my 10 clients.  I'm gonna sell them SEO.  Then I'm gonna sell them social media marketing.  And dude, I'm gonna triple my revenue, Aaron.  I'm gonna triple my revenue.  I'm gonna go from, you know, 10,000 a month.  Then with that first hit, maybe not even quite triple,  but let's say I sell 70% of the people on SEO.  You know, I'm gonna go from 10,000 to 17,000 like that, right?  And then I'm gonna sell them social media.  Maybe I'll only get 50% from there.  So I'm gonna be at like 22,000 bucks in a month  by just selling them these other services.  Aaron, what do you think happened?  You didn't triple or even double.  Not only did I not grow, my revenue actually went down, dude.  It actually went down.  Why?  Because, well, number one is I took my eye off the main thing  and the main thing is Legion  and that's the only thing that scales.  And so my service, my core service suffered, okay?  And because my core service suffered, guess what happened?  My referrals that I wasn't once getting  that was helping me grow my business completely dried up  because now those little tiny touches that I was making,  those checking in here, checking in there,  you guys saw me post this recently,  sending flowers to my customer's wife  because I had the mental bandwidth to do it.  Not that that's gonna necessarily grow your business.  Getting clients success and getting them results  is the number one thing,  but just those little touches,  I didn't even have the bandwidth for them.  So not only did my business not grow,  but it actually went down.  My core service suffered.  My referrals completely dried up  and I actually had and struggled to have a hard time.  I had a hard time retaining the clients that I did have.  My current clients then became a challenge to even keep those.  There was literally no growth and there was just frustration.  And actually my bottom line number went down  because guess what?  I added another service  and here's one of the services I offered.  I was so smart, guys.  I was like, I'm gonna do white label Go High Level.  Aaron, you haven't done that?  I barely know what that is, yeah.  So Go High Level is a software that used a CRM.  They have this program, it's genius.  You can go and you can pay to white label their software  and anything you sell above a certain price point  you get to keep and it's so scalable  and you're gonna promote it  and all this different stuff, right?  So that was a really cool service that I offered.  Curious, is there anybody that's like confident enough  or secure enough to admit in the chat  that they've tried that scam of a business model?  Has anyone done that?",

Yeah, if not, you guys are, I'm happy  because you guys are smarter than me.  But guys, guess what?  I didn't know how to do Go High Level.  I didn't know how to sell soft, like that kind of software.  I didn't know how to set it up.  I didn't know what, like whatever.  So guess what I did?  I went and hired somebody that was familiar  with Go High Level and I paid them, wasn't crazy  but I think I paid them like, for me at the time  it was really crazy.  It was like 3,500, 4,000 bucks a month.  So I basically, 50K a year to do this whole new service.  That was 50K that I had to make up  just to be at the same point net.  So that was just one service.  I also was offering SEO, third money maybe.  Then I was offering social media management.  Hey Joe, yeah, we actually are pretty good  at managing Facebook.  Check this page out.  We've grown our evergreen page to a thousand likes  and we're getting a lot of views on our videos.  We can actually give you a quote  on managing your Facebook page.  What do you think?  Six service, huh, Aaron?  Yeah.  Six is better than five.  Dude, we were an all encompassing agency.  We offer every service, bro.  A to Z, soup to nuts.  We were the full pack, dude.  We were the Michael Jordan of agencies, bro.  You come into our agency, we got you, dude.  We're getting you leads.  We're building you a new site.  We're going to do your SEO.  We can manage your Facebook.  Need t-shirts, we got you.  Need a CRM, check that, baby.  Dude, you want consulting, call your boy.  Dude, it's so funny because you think I'm joking, dude.  You want merchant services, got a solution for you, dude.  We're a full stack marketing agency, bro.  That's it, dude.  That's what I thought.  How long were you chasing the non-leash end services?  Stop, bro.  Stop, stop offering these services.  I like seven businesses, seven, dude.  And I was telling myself that I was just a full stack  marketing company, dude.  A to Z, bro.  Come in, dude, I got you covered, dude.  There's something else.  Oh, there was a point.  Hold on, hold on, 2020.  We were offering masks, masks, bro.  I can't make this stuff up.  You guys think I'm making this for like comic and dramatic effect?  I promise you, you go ask anyone that was working with me, Francesca.  Kyle wasn't with me at the time, but Francesca, go ask Francesca.  This is real stuff, dude.  This is pathetic.  Luckily, I've moved past the point where I can like laugh about this stuff.  Dude, I thought-  That wasn't long ago, 2022?  That 20, it was, so 2020 was the year we started doing this.  Sorry.  So 2019, so this is the embarrassing part that's funny, right?  So 2018, 19 is when I first started doing this.  And then 2020, not to cut ahead of myself, is",

Then I just did it again this year and it was a completely,  and I'll talk about that here in a second.  Anyway, guys, long story short, I didn't grow.  Now, the interesting part, I know there's probably somebody on here  that's like, yeah, I actually just did that and I made some money.  Cool.  But I guarantee that it's coming at the expense of a much bigger payday  that you could have got if you would have just focused on Legion.  Because guess what?  I initially got a deal or two too.  I got one or two people that said yes to me.  Yeah, I got a couple SEO clients and that's what gave me the confidence  to offer the next six services, okay?  So here's what happened.  2019, you guys know the story, I almost quit.  I was tired of this.  I was like, you know what?  I'm not cut out to be a marketing agency.  You know, six months earlier, I was full stack, baby.  I was offering everything, dude, everything.  And then six months later, I was like,  I don't know if I'm ready to do marketing.  I don't know if I should be in business.  I think I should just be a sales guy.  So you guys know the story, 2019,  I just about walked away from doing business for myself.  I was going to be a sales guy for somebody else,  had everything lined out and I luckily pulled my head out  and I was like, you know what, Nick?  No, you have to figure this out  because that's how you're going to get rich  is you have to have your own thing, right?  It's back to the Naval Ravicon, his book.  And he talks about like how to get rich without being lucky.  You have to own the business  or at least a part of the business, right?  That's the only way to get to the true money.  And then I was like, well, this also is recurring.  This also is asset-based.  And I started checking all the boxes and I'm like,  yeah, this is the right business.  I just have to figure this out.  So 2019, beginning of 2020, that's what I did, right?  Is I got rid of everything.  I got rid of every single thing except for Legion.  And ironically, eight months later,  I hit a hundred thousand dollars a month.  No BS, no like it wasn't, you know,  August, it wasn't June, it wasn't October,  July of 2020, we hit a hundred thousand dollars per month.  And eight months earlier, 2019, December,  we barely hit like eight to 10, okay?  So you'd think I would learn, but that's what happened.  As soon as I got rid of everything, I started growing.  Now I'm going to jump ahead a little bit.  One of my buddies, I guess I'd call him  more of a business acquaintance.  You guys probably saw this photo I posted recently  on my personal page, maybe you didn't,  but I did a podcast with this guy named Dan Henry.  He's a really sharp dude, whatever.  It was when I was in Dubai and he shared this reel  just the other day.  And he said that when he started in business  and he did really well, he got up to $250,000 per month.  He had one program or one service  or",

He got to 250 and he's like,  I'm going to add more products so I can get to a million  or whatever he was trying to get to.  And I think you might've heard me say this yesterday, Aaron,  but dude, he went down from 250.  He added 12 or 13 products and it dropped him to 70,000 per month.  Which is still a lot of money,  but when you're making three and a half times that much,  it's a kick in the pants, right?  So apparently he joined this mastermind  and the guy's like, tell me about your business, blah, blah, blah.  He's like, yeah, 13 different offers.  The guy was like, get rid of 12.  Or he had 14, he said, get rid of 13.  And he's like, okay, he got rid of everything but one.  And he scaled up to 500,000 a month.  Okay, guys, he's done it.  I've done it.  Hermosy's talked about it.  If you guys are offering multiple services, you're stupid.  And I hope someone could clip that and whatever, that's fine.  But until you are printing cash,  until your first service is an automated cash juicing machine,  you guys are losing and costing yourself  thousands and tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of dollars  by offering multiple services, okay?  So 2020, I scaled.  Beginning of 2021, I started to think about the same idea again.  And that's why you guys hear me talking about selling masks, right?  2020, 2021, everyone is starting to make money and selling masks.  I had some friends that were making supposedly big money in masks.  And I think some of them actually did.  And so I don't know how,  but I forgot that that was the thing that caused me not to scale.  And so I started offering services again.  And I started doing this whole BS again, guys.  And in 2021, what ended up happening is this time I made more money.  So I went from 7,000 or 7 figures, like just over a million, to 1.4, 1.45, 1.5 million.  This has nothing to do with this program.  This is just on my business.  But I actually did not make any additional money, bottom line.  I made the same amount of money.  I did 50% more work.  And I made the same amount of money.  How much more time did I spend away from my family?  How much more stress did I have?  How many more employees did I manage?  How many dinners and golf trips did I miss?  And I made no extra money, like literally no extra money.  I could have done the exact same thing I did the year before,  and I would have made the same amount of money,  and I would have had 50% more time.  So guys, I've heard Hermosy talk about this.  He talks about this concept of the woman in the red dress from The Matrix,  where it distracts you, and it's the very thing that will kill you.  And he says that as you get bigger, as you grow,  the woman in the red dress becomes more attractive, becomes more sexy.  And I will tell you that that is true,  because guess what?  When I did it in 2021, I now had 30 clients.  And the idea of offering a new service was way more attractive to",

And it was actually in 2021 that I did offer the Go High Level White Label,  and it sounded like such a good idea,  because now I have 30 clients instead of 8 or 10,  and it became more attractive, right?  But guys, all that it was was a freaking distraction, okay?  So I want to tell you guys really quick in these last few minutes  is how I think you should properly do it, okay?  Number one is you need to make sure that your core business,  your lead generation business,  again, for those of you that are trying to get out of your job,  I'm not necessarily talking directly to you,  because I would rather you do SEO to get out of your job and buy your time back,  and then do lead gen to replace that,  then I would have you stuck in your job.  But for everybody else, if you're just building lead gen  and you're okay in your job and you have a pretty good schedule  or you work from home or you don't mind it,  I would highly recommend you just build your income on lead gen only.  And basically what I'm saying is until that money,  that first money pays your bills and a lot more,  like it's spitting off cash,  it's to the point where mine is right now,  where in the last six business days,  we've gotten two deals.  I haven't talked to the clients.  I don't know the client's names.  I can't even remember the second one.  Francesca got like a small $300 a month deal.  I have no idea where it's at, what kind of service it's in,  what the business owner's name is.  I don't know what state it's in,  because I don't have to touch it anymore.  Francesca does it.  The only thing I have to do is approve when we spend money on new stuff.  That's the only thing that I really do in the business anymore.  Until you've gotten to like that point, then don't touch it.  Now, that's number one.  Number two, I personally think that you shouldn't go chasing second money.  I think that with second money, when it starts to come to you,  that's when it's the time.  When second money comes to you, not one time, not two times,  but like five times, that's when you start to go,  all right, I have an opportunity here.  Let me give you an example.  I didn't start digital landlords.  I didn't start this program until 2021 and at the end of 2021.  And guys, it was literally, I'm not saying it was by force,  because I clearly chose it.  And obviously, you guys can do the math.  There's great cash in it, and I'm never going to hide that.  But I didn't seek it out.  I was completely content.  Of course, I thought it was a good idea.  Of course, I knew that it would be a good idea.  But guys, I had five, sometimes 10 people a day reaching out to me,  asking me questions about how I was doing what I was doing,  asking me specifics, asking me if I could jump on a call with them,  asking if they could pick my brain.  And I'm not saying this to sound cool.  I'm saying it because I was trying to just send people videos and answer questions.  I had this opportunity knocking at my door,  and that's when I realized it was the time.  So the way to do it is get your first money,  humming like a machine, firing at",

And then, guys, what I would highly recommend is if it's not something  that you have to be involved in, obviously in this,  I have to be heavily involved because it's my process.  It's my face on this thing.  But let's say it's SEO.  Let's say for some reason you got people just knocking at your door for SEO  because all of your clients are so impressed with how you rank  and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  You just have droves of people asking you for SEO.  If that's the case, because SEO is not scalable  and you're going to have to add new employees,  you're going to have to add new systems and processes  and all this different stuff to scale,  guys, what I would highly recommend you doing  is finding a strategic partnership  that you can literally just refer the business to  and never talk to them again.  This is what I did in 2020 is I got rid of my SEO,  which made up almost half of my business,  about 4,000 out of the 10,000.  I created the partnership.  I went to someone and said,  what if you start your own SEO company?  Here's the split.  I don't even want my name on the company.  I just want you to give me 50% of the net profit.  I don't want to talk to them.  I'll sign the deals.  I'll refer you to business.  What do you think?  They said yes.  So when I'm talking about making seven figures in 2020,  that had nothing to do with SEO.  I made $6,000 to $10,000 a month that year,  and that was completely on just basically commissions.  That was basically on splits.  I didn't talk to the clients.  I didn't deal with the clients.  I didn't do anything like that,  and that wasn't included in that seven figures.  That was completely separate money.  That was just gravy money.  That was blow on golf money.  That had nothing to do.  So I didn't have to deal with it.  I didn't, and it's not even that I didn't have to do the service,  but I didn't have to deal with the headache or the bandwidth  or my customers being pissed off that I wasn't ranking.  It wasn't even attached to me.  They called me and tried to complain about it.  See, I'm like, that's not my deal, dude.  That's him.  That's not my business.  I just told you he's good, and I'll text him for you,  but that has nothing to do with me, sir.  And I would text him like, yo, this person's unhappy.  Can you deal with it?  That's the way I think you do second money.  That's the way that I found that works.  Get your business firing.  Wait till the second money is knocking at your door  and then find a strategic partnership.  Now, in the case of this program, it is scalable.  I can create the videos.  I could create the training, and then I could sell the training.  Obviously, we have to do the support and all this different stuff,  but I've committed to doing this.  I figured this out.  It's been a work in progress.  It is a work in progress.  It's a big commitment, but the opportunity was knocking at my door.  That's how I think you do second money.  And",

Nine months of 2017, I got distracted, but I did part of 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021.  I did it for five and a half years and made over a million dollars two years in a row  before I even thought about this.  So for those of you that are like,  I'm going to go rip some all-encompassing services.  I'm going to go do the full-stack marketing agency.  Could be a stupid, okay?  So guys, here's my challenge to you guys is get focused.  Get stupid.  Get simple.  What's this kiss?  Keep it stupid simple, right?  Keep it stupid simple.  Focus on one service.  Stop doing second money.  One service, one offering, one niche, one deal structure, one sales process,  and a bunch of money.  That's what I want to recommend to you guys.  That's from experience, not from theory.  Thanks for being on the call, guys.  I will see you guys next week.  Thanks, Aaron.  All right.  Take care.",

Okay, we've got one person on.  Maybe that's me.  I'm going to wait a second.  My chat, Facebook's terrible.  I can't even see who's on.  It's awesome.  If you can see me, hear me, please comment below, okay?  In the comments.  I'm going to be quick on this.  I'd like to have a few people on live.  If not, I'll just go anyway, but let's go ahead and see.  I'm going to wait one, two minutes and I'm going to hop on.  Can you hear me?  Let me know in the chat.  If you can, make a comment, make an emoji, do something, but I just want to, just real  quick, I'm going to be five, 10, 15 minutes.  If you're lucky, it's going to be much less than that, okay?  Can you hear me?  Okay, see a few people on.  Beautiful.  All right.  Unfortunately, I can't see your comments come in real time, but I do see some comments  that keep refreshing.  Kevin, what's up, dude?  Nicholas Kudlick, what's up?  Kevin says, what's up, homie Nick?  What's going on?  Laura Shepard can hear me.  Guys, welcome to the call.  This is going to be a quick little live.  I hadn't even planned on doing this.  I had planned on doing something else, but I just want to say something as a follow-up.  Jason Allred, what's up, dude?  Guys, it is, what is today, March 19th.  For me, it's almost 5 p.m., it's 4.48.  We're almost done with quarter one, which is pretty wild, pretty exciting, also scary  if you're not doing anything with your business or your life, but guys, I was thinking about  this the other day and I've been thinking about it and I want you guys to really put  yourself in this frame of thought and then also I'm going to tell you why I'm bringing  this up to you right now, but imagine if the deal structure that you had, imagine if there  was no flat fee, if there was no paper lead, if there was no commission, if there was no  joint venture.  Imagine that the only way you got paid as a marketer, as a lead generator, as somebody  who owns a lead generation agency, imagine if the only way that you got paid was if  and when your customer made money.  Not when they got the lead, not at the first of the month, not on the 15th of the month,  not every week, only when your clients made money.  If that was the case, how differently would you attack it?  How differently would you treat the relationship with your business owner?  How differently would you be in your selection of the people that you choose to work with?  It would be radically different.  For me, if I think about that, it would be radically, radically different.  What would you expect out of your business owner?  Would you tolerate your business owner not answering the phone?  Would you tolerate your business owner or even think about working with somebody that  didn't show up to the Zoom meeting or show up or respond back to a phone call or treated  a customer like, crap, would you do that?  No, because the only way that you would be getting paid is if",

If you guys didn't see it, go check it out, guys.  Last week I went live.  I can't even remember what I called it.  I think I called it Porter's step-by-step guided 10th, 11,700, whatever it was.  Basically, I just went on a rant about what the heck are you guys doing?  Why is no one making money?  Why is no one doing anything?  And thank goodness from that I saw a bunch of people make posts.  They are doing stuff.  For some reason people just don't want to talk about it.  By the way, thank you.  Shout out to AJ.  Shout out to Gina.  Shout out to Vaughn.  Shout out to Porter.  Shout out to all these people that are actually posting their deals and doing stuff.  The point is, guys, is that basically, well, not basically, going off of that live that  I did, I'm sitting here and I'm not thinking about this as much with my rank and rent clients.  I'm not thinking about this as much as my agency.  But I'm thinking about that with you guys is I'm sitting here going, sometimes I let  you guys come in here and, of course, you guys pay to be here.  Thank you.  I appreciate you putting your trust in me.  I appreciate you giving me your hard-earned cash.  And I will not disappoint you.  I will show up.  I will be here.  I don't care if I have to miss something.  Tonight I've got to get on an 11 o'clock thing because of the time zone.  I chose to be here.  That's part of the game.  I will deliver.  But then once I let you guys in, I haven't been that good about holding you accountable.  I haven't been that good about sticking it to you guys.  And I think part of the reason is because I'm like, well, they paid and it's really  their decision if they want to make money.  And I'm just tired of that, right?  I'm super, super tired of that.  And I want to start treating you guys as if I don't get paid until you make money.  And maybe I'm going to start charging that once you get in for the first five deals,  I don't know, maybe we'll start restructuring the payment.  You're going to pay the same amount to get in, then you're going to give me a percentage  of the, I don't know, well, I don't know.  Maybe not.  Maybe probably not.  Okay.  But I don't know.  But I'm just, I just want you guys to hear me and hear my enthusiasm and also my frustration  that I'm guys, we're adults.  We're adults.  I've read every one of you that's on here right now, every single person that's commented.  Thank you.  I read your application.  I probably got on your call.  I saw the pain that you were going through, the reason why you're in this group, the reason  why you want to become financially free, the reason why you want to make money renting  out simple websites so you can stop letting your kids down, so you could take care of  your mom, so you can stop having regret and you're not going to wake up one day and have  a bunch of things that you wish you would have done.  You told me all these things. ",

What are you doing?  I know some of you guys that heard my other live here are like, oh, here he goes again,  but guys, what have you done in the last week and a day?  What have you done in the last eight days since I came on here and tried to blast everyone  and said, what have you guys done?  How many times do you have to be reminded?  If you guys didn't see that, please go watch it.  I'm talking to grown ass adults and I swore I wasn't going to curse, but I'm talking to  grown ass adults here.  You guys aren't kids.  You're not in high school.  You're not forced to be here.  You guys paid to be in this group.  You guys forget that?  You paid me money to be in this group and now you're not doing shit with it.  What have you done?  What have you done in the last week?  I want to know.  I want to know somebody that's brave enough.  Tell me what you've done in the last eight days to make money.  It doesn't include dicking around on Weebly and doing this.  I'm talking about how many people have you asked for money?  Last week, Porter asked somebody for money Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday,  Saturday.  He asked people for money six days of the week.  No wonder he's at $11,700.  Francesca, if you guys didn't know this, was it last Thursday?  I can't remember.  No.  Sorry.  Monday, she got on a call.  She lost the deal.  She lost.  Tuesday, she got another call.  That one went sideways.  Yesterday afternoon, she got on another one and got the deal.  It's little wonder that she's landed deals three of the last four weeks and she will  land another one this week because I will make sure that she does.  What are you doing?  This is a rhetorical question, but I also would love for somebody to be brave enough  to answer the question.  By the way, I can't see your comments, so whatever you're commenting, I'm going to try  to refresh it here in a second, but what are you doing?  What are you doing?  What are you doing with your business?  When is enough going to be enough?  When are you going to stop?  Are you going to really see how pathetic it is that you not only paid money to be in here,  but you're actually not doing anything?  You're actually not ... What I think I should start doing is when you come in, you pay the  money and you give me some ridiculously embarrassing piece of information that I can blackmail  you with, and if you don't hit your damn goals, I'm going to post it online.  Maybe that would be the thing, but guys, it's like every day I'm sitting here and I'm looking  at certain people that keep talking, I'm going to do it.  I saw a bunch of comments, oh, I got the kick in the pants from Nick.  Cool, what have you done?  What have you done?  I hope you understand, some of you guys are probably sitting there going, well, Nick,  what does it matter?  You've already gotten paid.  It means everything.  How do I keep growing this group?  How do I get feedback on what's working, what's not, if you guys aren't doing",

To be honest, I feel like I'm like my football coach back in high school when everyone just  wanted to grow their hair out and be cool and they didn't really want to hit the gym  and eat good and they cared way more about being cool than they did about actually winning  football games.  I was like, dude, this guy's psycho.  I'm the psycho now.  Read the slide edge.  Read 10 pages of the slide edge every single day.  Do that and implement what it says in that book.  I gave you guys the book.  I know Porter's reading it because I'm following up with him.  I hit Kyle up today.  I said, Kyle, are you reading your book?  Yes.  Are you doing your sales training every day?  Yes.  Are you hitting the gym every day?  Yes.  Boom.  Little wonder.  He's only lost three deals this entire month.  He's closing above 90%.  Go figure.  Go freaking figure.  Paul King says he converted two commission clients to flat rate, got a referral, charged  them a set up fee to build himself.  Beautiful.  Paul King doing work.  Post it, bro.  Post that crap, bro.  I want to know.  By the way, for these that are shy about posting, people are going to judge who cares.  It's way ... You're going to get ... That's awesome, dude.  You're making moves.  You're shaking moves.  Some of you guys are like, oh, I want to get a post.  By the way, most of the deals that we've been landing lately are just smaller deals.  Guess what?  We're building that muscle of asking people for money on landing deals.  Paul, great job.  Make a post about it.  Let's let people know about it.  Let's get people excited.  What are you guys freaking ... I'm so glad that Paul said something.  I'm going to give Francesca a shout out.  I'm going to yell at her for not posting about it if she hasn't already, haven't checked  the group.  Francesca's doing work.  Porter's doing work.  Kyle's doing work.  My inner circle's doing work because I'm making them.  I'm not making them, but I'm hopefully inspiring them.  I'm telling them, like, hey, I'm going to hold you accountable.  I texted Kyle this morning, like I said, and I'm like, I'm holding you accountable, bro.  Have you done this, this, and this?  I have a group chat with my two brothers, not just Porter, my other one.  I'm like, hey, are you guys reading ... They're also reading the book.  What are you doing?  You paid to be here.  You paid great money to be here.  I'm showing up every single week.  I'm constantly giving you guys new things to think about, new things to work on.  We have amazing support.  You guys have somebody that helps you with ads.  You guys have somebody that helps you with all tech issues.  You guys have Kyle.  You have myself.  You have Ashley.  You have Porter.  You have Jason.  You have the exact blueprint that we used to close three other last four weeks closed  deals that Porter's using.  He's at $11,700 per month.  What are you doing?  What the heck are you doing?  I want you to think about it like that.  Before you get angry or get frustrated that I keep coming at you, I'm going to keep coming  at you because I want you to feel",

I don't care.  I know when I was coming up, I was working Saturday mornings minimum and I have kids  and I got other stuff too, but I was working Saturday mornings doing sales calls.  I was doing something sales related every single day of the week.  You may not have the ability to ask somebody for money every single day because you don't  have enough deals in the pipe.  Every single one of you should be on the phone doing prospecting calls every single day,  but Nick, I don't have a campaign that's generating leads.  Who cares?  Go pick a random city and practice.  Get good at doing it while you're waiting or go hook somebody in advance.  Find the area that you want to go into and hook somebody while you wait for the leads  to come in.  I mean, heaven forbid.  Guys, the work that actually moves the needle is talking to business owners, doing sales.  That's the work that matters.  How much have you done this week?  My guess is that 99% of you guys haven't done jack shit.  That's the truth.  That's the truth.  Well, I watched some training videos.  I watched the live.  I spent an hour looking at due diligence.  Cool.  Good job.  Go do 100, then outsource it.  Go do 100 due diligence.  Master the process of finding a city and niche.  Go hire someone for pennies in the Philippines and get that off your plate and focus on sales.  Oh, but I wrote content.  Awesome.  Get 20,000 words of content for your first five websites.  Train somebody for the Philippines or Africa or whatever.  Create a process.  Outsource it.  Spend more time on sales.  You want to make more money?  Spend more time on sales.  Don't sit there and think that you're doing work because you're watching videos or you're  listening to freaking Joe Rogan or you're listening to Jocko Willink talking about  getting in the ice bath.

But don't sit there.  Oh, my campaign.  I'm just waiting for my campaign.  Just waiting for you to come in.  Let me message Fix It Felix and ask another question.  Go do some work.  Okay?  It's been a long 10 cents.  I dropped the F word on this and I'm getting close on this call.  Go do some actual work and quit talking about the work you're going to do and start doing  the actual work.  I'm going to start treating this as if I have not made any money and then until you guys  get a deal, I have not made any money.  I'm going to have to frame my mind like that and that's how I'm going to start treating  you guys.  And the reality is that the way that most of you are acting and if I had structured this  program as I only get paid if you guys make money, 90% of you I wouldn't have let in this  program.  90% of you I wouldn't have let in here because",

It's literally completely transformed my entire world.  It's allowed me to do things I never thought I'd be able to do at this age.  It's allowed me to go places, buy things, take care of people I never thought I could  do at this stage at 34 years old, okay?  It got me out of debt.  It's given me confidence that I can't even describe, that I can take care of those around  me.  It's done everything for me, this business model and this exact program, these steps,  these scripts, these niches that I'm going into, these things that I'm talking about.

Here's my tip, never send more than five leads, but as soon as they close one, go for the  close.  You send them one lead, they go and run it that night, they close it, go for the close.  Get on a Zoom call, go close it, go for the close.  Now at the same time, do not feel that or think that the business owner has to make  money before you can go for the close because they don't.  And I've got tons and tons of different examples where I have sent two, three leads, the business  owner scheduled one for tomorrow, one for Friday, one for next week, and I just feel  like it's time to go and I've gone and closed the deal tomorrow morning.  They don't even run the leads, much less close the leads.  So don't think that they need to make money at all.  Now if they make money, even better, but if you don't, you don't have to send them leads  until they make money.  You just need to send them leads so they can see the quality and the style and how you  operate and what it's going to be like working with you and make sure it's a great experience.",

What would you recommend in that?  Things are going good, getting good impressions, gets a suspension unsuspends and now he's only  getting five to 10 a day. Is that something where he needs to just go recreate it because  he's kind of got a black black X on him or is it just time of year and some other factors?  Probably other factors. Go check population, budget, CPC, go look at the edit, make sure there  hasn't been increases. That's probably more it than that. Typically once you're done with the  suspension you're fine. They don't really hover over it unless you're being a jerk and you continue  to push the buttons then they'll flag you but none of us here are trying to do that so once  you're through it you're good.",

Hold on just a second, all right, guys welcome to the call, welcome Craig just joined, maybe.  I'm not really sure, okay, now he's back, let's see.  Let's see what we got here, there's Craig, all right Craig welcome to the call man, good  to have you on, I've got this thing recording, let's jump right into it, I just want to pull  up a couple notes to make sure I don't miss anything and it's gonna make me sign in, hold  on one second guys, I hope it's not making me do the two-step note, we're good, okay.  Just want to make sure we don't miss anything, I've got a few things I wanted to make sure  just to cover really quick and then let's dive into some Q&A, go over anything you guys  want to talk about, I've got a few things I want to cover and let's start off this  Monday morning, I guess it's 7 a.m. for you guys depending on where you're at, all right,  here we are, okay, as long as you guys can hear me let's get started, so guys, Craig  is here, what am I seeing over here, okay, all right guys, March 3rd, we're two months  into the new year, crazy hot times flying, I would highly encourage you guys if you haven't  made a habit of doing this is take the first Monday of every month, Monday, Tuesday and  look at how your month went, did you hit the goals that you set, your revenue goals,  if you didn't hit your revenue goals, hold on, letting people in, there's Frank back  in the house, okay, if you didn't hit your revenue goals, why, did you not do enough  appointments, did you not do enough Zoom calls, if you didn't do enough Zoom calls, why is  that, did you not get enough business owners on the hook, what I'm going to be doing today  in about an hour after this call finishes is I'm going to be going through, got my  goals in my notebook here and I'll be looking at what, you know, where we actually ended  up for the month versus where our goal was to end up and then just course correct, guys,  it's very simple stuff but it's just like if we were trying to go from, just like the  example I always like to use, if our roadmap, if we started in Washington where Paul's at  and we wanted to get to Miami and Miami would be representative of our goal of $20,000 per  month by July 1st or by December 31st, right, you want to take inventory and find out, okay,  it's two months in and we're all the way over in Idaho when we should be down in, I don't  know, Denver, I don't even know where the path would be but okay, that's fine, you guys,  we can still get to Miami but now we got to take a different direction, we've got to speed  it up, we can't take as many breaks, we've got to, you know, maybe increase the speed  that we were going to go by five miles per hour for the next, you know, two months, whatever,  but guys, you have to be taking inventory.  One thing I did not do last year is I set my goals and I just kind of like, just did  my thing.  I didn't check on them, I didn't, you know, audit where we were at",

This year so far I've done a really good job and at the end of last month I went and I  just took my notebook, looked at my goals, we had our biggest month of the last 12 months  was January and I was like, what do we do right, what do we do wrong and anyway, just  a simple thing, you guys, just take an hour, look at your goals and by the way, if you  don't even have your goals, go watch the, we have a mini course called Map Your Goals  or I think it's called Map Your Goals, go watch that, set your goals.  You guys, what we use, I think I talk about it in the training, but I use this book, Think  and Grow Rich, one of the sections in here, one of the chapters in here talks about basically  goal setting and we use the framework from this book to set your goals, okay, that's  what I like and I think it's chapter, I think it's chapter, what chapter is it, let me just  tell you guys in case you want to check it out.  I think it is chapter, dang, these chapters are a little bit beefy, hold on, hold on,  I think it's chapter seven, I think it's chapter seven, I could be wrong, but anyway, I'm almost  positive it's chapter seven, maybe somebody can back me up there, but anyway, yes, under  organized planning, I think this is the chapter that you're going to want to use.  Anyway, if you guys haven't set your goals, please do that, please do that, it's going  to be huge for you guys, okay.  Other thing I want to say really quick and then we'll get into Q&A, a couple weeks ago  I shared a link inside of the group, inside of the school community and it was a link  to a book called The Slide Edge, okay, free link, free PDF and I just said to you guys  this book, I think I said this book will change your life and I want you guys to know that  I started this book around, this is my fifth time reading it, fourth or fifth time reading  it, I started this book around the last week of January, I just finished it on Saturday,  okay, I was on the treadmill, finished the last pages, guys, this book, it's such a simple  book, it's such an easy read, but I promise you and it's not an affiliate link, it's  none of that, it will change your life.  If you just read the book 10 pages a day, you read the book, you do the actions, I've  recommended my little, I've recommended everybody in digital landlords to read it, I've personally  asked my little brother Porter to read it, which by the way, I think he's like a fourth  the way through, I bought multiple copies for people, it is a phenomenal book, if you  feel like you're stuck in a rut, if you feel like you can't quite get that momentum, if  you feel like you're just, you're right there on the cusp that you can't get it, go read  this book, okay, slide edge 10 pages a day, it'll freaking change your life and I'm telling  you that again, I have no, I'm not getting paid to say that, whatever, okay, but guys,  what this book's done for me, it's just allowed me, it just helped me to have a number one  realize that it's literally this game is about doing all these little things correctly and  doing them again and again and again and again and when you start doing the little things  in one",

This year, I'm very intentional about, hey, I'm not missing work days, I'll travel on  the weekends and I'll miss my weekends, I'll sacrifice going out on the weekend so I can  travel, I can get to my spot, get set up, get rested and get ready to go.  So I was coming to London, I think I already said that, I came to London and I was trying  to figure out when should I go, when should I go, when should I go and I literally made  the decision to come here on a Friday, like a Friday afternoon so I could work the morning  and then I could work a little bit on the plane and then guys, I got here, the room  wasn't ready of course, it was like 12, I hadn't slept much at all, I was so tired  but basically what I did is on Friday, I planned my day Friday like I was going to run the  whole day and then I said to myself, whatever I miss, whatever I don't get on Friday when  I'm traveling, I'm going to move it to Saturday and I'm going to take care of it and it sounds  like a great idea until it's actually Saturday and you actually have to do it and you actually  have to work and you're tired and your room's not ready but needless to say guys, Saturday  before I took a nap, before I did anything, I got here, I went to a coffee shop, I busted  out a couple hours of work, got some food, finally got checked in the room, did another  30 minutes of work and then I finally let myself sleep, okay.  I woke up before I went out, did anything, I went to the gym, these little teeny, these  little things guys, they are all adding up and it's crazy because they're all contributing  to like I've never, I feel momentum like I haven't in years, okay, again, this all comes  back to one thing, reading 10 pages of The Slide Edge every single day for the month  of February and it's completely transformed my entire business, I feel so much momentum,  I feel excited, I'm pumped, so I want to, I'm giving you guys a gift, there's a PDF,  type in Slide Edge PDF, it's completely free, you guys read 10 pages, they will change your  life, okay.  All right, that's it guys, that's all I want to share, let me turn the AC off, it's blowing  right on me, hold on.  And let's get into it guys, one quick thing, if you guys haven't already, please go and  update the map, I think I showed you guys last week, but let me, if I could just show  you really quick",

I'll give you guys an update on my agency here in a second, but let me see what questions  you guys have.  By the way, well, let me go start at the top here, okay, Craig said, goal setting for me  is the easy part, translating into data execution seems to be the gap in moving the needle,  lead lag activities, suggestions in changing that, so Craig, answer this in the comments  for me, is do you not know which daily activities you should execute, or are you just having  a hard time actually doing the thing?  Give me that clarification, we'll keep moving along with that thread, okay?  Okay, Paul says, are the videos you guys were putting together for Rare available yet?  Great question, that's something that Ryan's taken care of, let me message him right now  and ask, I know you asked a question about Rare last time, Paul, and I appreciate it,  and if you didn't get the",

So let me ask Ryan really quick, I'm just gonna send him a quick text, okay, I will  have an answer for you, Paul, as soon as possible, there's Porter joining right now, okay, Francesco  says, how would you structure a Google Ads account and how would you organize keyword  ad groups, one group for a concrete contractors on or multiple services?  Okay, so I think it was you, Francesco, I think, I'm pretty sure I made a comment on  your post, you asked, I think you asked a part of this question, or maybe it was a bigger  part of this question, so I'm gonna give a little bit of guidance here, but I want you  to understand that I want you to be, I want everybody to be very careful with Google Ads,  okay, you need to understand that yes, Google Ads is a great part of the puzzle, it allows  you to move faster, it allows you to go and put up a one-pager today, run Google Ads,  get the things sped up and hopefully get a deal, at the same time, you have to remember,  I have spent $1.5 million, I have been doing Google Ads since 2020, I have lost a lot of  money and this is not even including the amount of money, guys, in the last year, I've spent  probably close to another 10 grand just on, listen to this, I've spent close to, maybe,  no, it's probably more than that, let's say about 10 grand, just in the last year, because  I was like, you know what, I think we can make our Google Ads training just a little  bit better, I'm talking about Inside Digital Landlords, I went, I found this guy that was  supposed to be really good, highly recommended and said, hey, give me a proposal, I want  to work with you, I want you to show me what you can do, I'm gonna let you run my campaigns,  I'm gonna pay you to run my campaigns and this individual ran my campaigns for months  and, long story short, they weren't really performing any better than what we were already  doing and I was paying a lot more money and it was a lot more difficult to set up and  all this stuff, so I spent $10,000 and all that I learned was that that guy didn't have  anything that I didn't already have, okay, so I'm telling you this because sometimes  we get in, we hear about running ads and we just think we're gonna throw up an ad and  leads are gonna come in, or I'm gonna give you one little answer and it's gonna change,  just understand that you either have to pay the $1.5 million to learn it or you need to  get proper training, which is what we do inside of Digital Landlords for Google Ads and I  want to say that because there's no way I could cover, now, why don't I cover more Google  Ads inside of the RankinRant Academy, well, the reason why is because I don't want this  to turn into a customer service nightmare, okay, once you commit to actually doing this  business for real, for real, for real and you're inside Digital Landlords, I know that  you're gonna do the business, I know that you have to make it work because you've committed  with your money, with your",

Well, and I know that's not what you're asking, but if somebody asks,  what should you set the daily budget at? Well, it really depends, you know, should I let it go  higher than five bucks per cost per click? Well, what are you, what factors are we, what's, what,  you know, what niche are we looking at? What city, what kind of budget, what kind of a deal are you  looking to sign? How much budget are you going to have? You know, how, like there's so many  different factors, so if you want, you can message me privately on school, I'll see what I can  do to, in terms of pointing you in the right direction, but that's the stuff that we cover  more into the more in-depth training, okay? Okay, let's keep going. Craig says, I think I just  answered my question clearly defined why. Okay, he's talking about executing. Sorry,  I'm jumping ahead here. Okay. What's that?

I want you to answer this question for Michael, just because this is something  you're currently dealing with, but he says, how do you overcome the objection of track records?  You get on a call with the business owner. It's your first deal. They don't have any other proof,  you don't have any other websites to show anybody of, hey, I did this for so-and-so.  How do you deal with that at the business owners asking you for references or whatever? How did  you get your first deal that way? When I have anything, I honestly was just super transparent.  I wasn't like, you're my first deal, but in a way I was like, I want to build this relationship  off trust. I understand you probably want proof and all this, but I've sent you three or four  leads. You've quoted them. I'm getting the jobs. I want to build this out of trust. If you have any  second thoughts now, then I would rather you tell me, then we get into this some months.  I almost just play that card because, again, I don't want to lie to the guy, but again,  you want to work with someone that's not always questioning you. If he's questioning you, it's  most likely you've maybe done something in the past. You haven't quite earned their trust enough  for them not to, because when I did it right the first time, no one asked me about it, but I've  been asked that when I haven't gained enough trust before the call. Does that make sense?  Yeah, it's true. This is one of the things to remember, Michael, is if you are getting the  same objection again and again and again, it's usually something that at a subconscious level  you have an issue with. For example, people that I always hear are like, how do you get around price?  How do you get around price? Dude, I never get objection of price. I think one of the reasons  why is because to me, if you tell me, hey, it's a thousand bucks a month, that is not to me personally  because I've been in business. I know what stuff costs. I know what it costs to pay for employees,  to pay for an office. A thousand bucks a month is just another bill,  right? But sometimes when we start business and we're used to a $4,000 a month salary  and every hundred dollars counts, and I've been there and we're asking people for a thousand bucks  a month, and you know that if somebody asks you for a thousand bucks a month, it would scare the  crap out of you. What you're doing is you're selling out of your own wallet, and so you're  projecting whatever. I never get price. I never get price objection. I never get contract objection.  Why? Because I've resolved these objections in myself, and I've seen this with sales reps.  I've seen this with people that I've trained in all kinds of different areas. If you are continually  getting that, I don't know if you are, but if Michael, if you're getting this again and again,  you have to realize that you're probably somebody, I'm guessing, that has to see a track record or  whatever, but I like what Porter said, and I think it's really true, is you just be transparent. You  probably",

    "pageContent": "don't go in like Porter's saying and be like, yeah, this is my very first client ever.  Congratulations. However, I think it's fine to just be very transparent and be like, hey,  I'm actually pretty new to this, but look, I've already sent you three leads. The proof's in the  pudding, and I'd love to earn your business, and you can even frame it like you're giving them a  bit of a deal as long as they give a testimony like, hey, I'm normally going to charge $1,500  for this. I'm only going to charge you $1,000 if you'll give me a testimony once this is said  and done. That's one way. Another thing that you can do is you can borrow off of other people's  success. I'm more than happy if you guys want to use one of my websites, like Bentonville Concrete,  and show them, hey, this is one of our partner sites, blah, blah, blah. Can you come back in  20 minutes? Hold on. Porter, keep going. Yeah. No, and that's a good point. For my first deal,  I actually used Bentonville Concrete as a site that would say, hey, this is the goal. Obviously,  I don't have one that I've ranked organically myself because I'm pre-sold by pre-selling,  but I have used Bentonville Arkansas to close my first deal. Again, if they're wanting like, hey,  do you have other reviews of a website for your company? It's like, no, I don't have a website.  I don't have any other clients. You're my first client, but you don't say that. Yeah,  I think it's totally chill. Up until just recently, I started using my own sites,  but I was using Bentonville Arkansas for my first five deals.  It's not a big deal if you guys want to do that. Guys, when I first started knocking doors,  you know what they trained me on? They said the same thing. They're like, well,  when you knock on the door, you want to name drop a couple of people you've started working,  you've done deals for, and I'm like, well, this is my first deal. They're like, well,  I just closed this lady named Susie, and there's this other guy named Danny, so you're going to  use those names, and they gave me their last names, whatever. So I'd knock on the door,  keep in mind I'm in Arkansas, and I'm like, hey, you happen to know Lucy down the street,  or I can't remember if it was, anyway. I'm like, do you know so-and-so? I've used the full name,  Lucy Smith. Oh, you don't know Lucy? Meanwhile, she's in Utah, right? They're customers,  but I'm like, yeah, we just set them up, which we did. They're just in Utah.  We kind of just leveraged that confidence. Anyway, you could do it any way you want to do.  You don't have to be shady or anything like that, but just be transparent. It's the same  thing when people always ask me, what do you do when the business owner asks you  how you're getting the leads? I'm like, you tell them? You tell them. What do you mean?  Well, you want to show them the website? Yeah. What if they ask you if you're running ads?  Yeah. What's there to hide? Yeah, I'm running ads, dude. I'm getting you leads. You got a  problem with that? It doesn't matter. Same thing, but it's",

    "pageContent": "a bit nerve-racking when you  don't have your first deal. Just use Bentonville Concrete. Use any of my websites. Be transparent  with them. Again, coming back to what Porter said, if you give leads up front, that's going  to overcome most of the objections. That's going to help eliminate the biggest objection,  which is the trust issue. That's what you're dealing with is the person doesn't totally  trust you yet because they're asking for reviews. I would say to them, Mr. Business  Owner, what do you need to see? My leads is my credentials. You're getting leads. What  else do you need to know? You know what I'm saying? Usually they don't care. Even if you  ranked organically and you're getting them leads and they're not making money, they're going to  stop working with you regardless. Or you could be paying for Google Ads and be sending them the  same leads and they could be making money on them. They don't care where they're coming from. As  long as they're making money, they're not going to ask questions. Very true. Very true.  Let's see. This is a good question here. I want to address it.  Craig was talking about, he's like goal setting is the easy part. Then he's like,  how do you translate it into daily execution? I asked him, I said, is your problem with  figuring out what to do or actually executing on it? He said that he answered his own question.  He said executing. Then a little bit later, he said, I think I just answered my own question,  clearly defining why. Porter, let me ask you about this. You've been doing this about two years.  You've probably had times where, because you've set your goals, you know exactly what you need  to do. This week, I need to hook two business owners, whatever. Let's say that's your activities.  How have you been able to get more consistent with actually executing on the things  that you need to do? What would you say your advice is? Because I know that there's been  times when you've kind of sloughed off or gotten distracted. Then recently, this year,  if you guys weren't inside of digital landlords, me and Porter, was it last week? I think so. Maybe  last week we talked about replacing business owners. Porter actually lost two business  owners in the same day and replaced them the same day. Then he also hooked somebody else. Then  he had them on trial. Porter gets a lot more nos than he talks about. He's got somebody else  on trial. Anyway, how have you been able to stay consistent with executing the actual activities?  Hey, I need to hook a business owner every week. In order to do that, I need to call  five business owners. Not call, but talk to five business owners. How do you get yourself to  consistently do that? It's easy to put it down. It's hard to actually do. What are some tips?  I think the first thing is to share your goals with somebody else, whether it's the group or  someone that you feel like is actually going to hold you accountable. I think as soon as I told  people within the group that I was making 10K, the last thing I want to do is to either get on a call  and not be at 10K when we're talking about making money at 10K. My standard was, oh, I'm just kind  of below 10K to now. I've hit the 10K and my pride is I don't want to get below that. It's crazy  what your mind and what you can accomplish when you are like, hey, I'm just not dropping below",

    "pageContent": " this. Me and Nick talked about this before, but it's like a thermostat. As soon as the temperature  drops below a certain point, the AC unit or the heater kicks on and then it gets to a certain  point. Then we get comfortable and then it kicks off. I think that was my biggest thing is I'm  still trying to figure this out, but I want to consistently be going this way and not just feel  like this comfort. I just think for me, it's like share your goals with people and set your  standards of this is just who I am. This is what I do because I think that's the hardest thing is  I was doing this consistently, but was I actually bought into it? Was I actually doing it to make  money or was I doing it to say, hey, I was just doing this business model every day? I wasn't  really moving the needle. Like last week, I had this guy that I had hooked that Nick was talking  about. Basically, we didn't make it to the call and I immediately got back on the phone and I  called someone and I have a Zoom call scheduled for Saturday, which they had to push it today,  so I rescheduled it. It's at 430 today. Before that, I felt like it would have really discouraged  me because I would have lost that deal technically, but then it's like I could  have waited a week to call somebody else, but you just get back on the phone and you're like,  I want to get past that 10K. I don't want to be just barely over 10K. That's just my standard now.  That's probably the best way that I can explain it now. I'm still working on it. I'm not perfect,  but that's just kind of what has really driven me recently.  Good. Yeah. I mean, at the end of the day,  it's like, and I think you answered your own question. He said clearly defining his why.  It's like when I wake up tired and not excited about stuff, I'll be honest, this morning I woke  up. I'm still a little jet lagged. I don't know why, but I woke up and I woke up at 630.  I did my regular stuff. The first hour, I wasn't jacked about sitting down,  planning out all my employees' to-do lists, and then planning my team meeting.  I have the same Monday pretty much every single Monday. I wasn't super thrilled about it,  and I didn't feel that great either, just for the record. But I know, and I remember thinking  there are certain things that I want to do this year that's going to require a certain amount  of capital. There's been some investments that I really, really want to make that's going to put  me in a position to be very, very set in terms of passive income. And in order for me to be part  of these projects, I'm going to need to bring a lot of money to the table. Because I know exactly  what I want to do, where I'm going to put that money, how much money I need to bring in,  when I start getting tired, I'm like, dude, Nick, just pull out of it for a second, go walk around  the block, whatever, do some press ups, drink some water, get back to it. It's all going to  be worth it in the end. So yes, defining your why and exactly why you're doing this. And then  also just think about the alternative. If that doesn't inspire you, if you don't have a why that  inspires you, think about the alternative. Think about what life is going to look like if you keep  on the same path that you're on",

    "pageContent": "right now. Just like, let's say we even were Porter's at. Porter's  making 10K a month. That's great. He's in a much better position than he was making $0 per month  and just making money from his full-time thing. But if he stays the same, he's going to just be  at 10K per month in five years. That's not exciting. That's terrible. So I always think about,  if you know exactly what you want, why you want it, but then also just look at what's the  alternative. For me, I'm so terrified of waking up and realizing I just wasted it.  And not only I just wasted it, but I was just another average freaking dude that's like,  yeah, he was a good guy and he was a hard worker. And it's like, so? Everybody's a good guy and a  hard worker. I want to be somebody that actually did something huge and did something that changed  a lot of lives. And I'm so terrified of just blending into everybody else. And so these things  drive me. And sometimes I'm using negative things to drive me. Sometimes it's positive things. But  I guess the quote is, I don't know the exact quote, but  you do what needs to be done when it needs to be done, regardless of how you feel. That's it.  You map it out. You set the goal. You map it out. And then you do  what has to be done that day. And guys, you're most of the time not going to feel like doing it.  That's just the truth. When I got here on Saturday, I think I was sharing this at the beginning,  Porter, you missed it. But when I got here on Saturday, I had things that I missed on Friday  because I was traveling. And I told myself, if I'm going to miss those things, it's about three  hours worth of work. I'm either doing it on the plane or I'm doing it when I get to the hotel  before I do anything. And I was so tired. I had not slept crap. I got like 30 minutes to an hour  done on the plane, got here before I slept because the room wasn't that I cranked out the work.  And I wasn't inspired by it. I was tired. I was just like some of it. I was quite honestly  going through the motions, but I had to get certain things done. And every part of me wanted to,  I'll just do it on Monday. I'll push it till next week. I'm like, no, I've committed to doing this.  And then I woke up from my nap and I'm like, Hey, I got to go to the gym. And I didn't want to go to  the gym because I was supposed to go out at, you know, meet my friend at a certain time for this  event. But I'm like, dude, I've already committed to doing it. I've got certain fitness goals that  I've got to hit. And that's it. So get clear about your wild, think about the alternative,  and then just do it. It's just a habit of doing it, even if you don't feel like doing it, I think.  And it's, and it's also comes down to like, when you say you're going to do something like the night  before, it's like, you're so motivated to do something. And then the next day, it's like,  you don't feel like it. But if you keep telling, like, if you don't, if, like, if you don't do what  you tell yourself, you're going to do it. Like your confidence just goes down. It's",

It's like, you're shooting yourself in the foot. Like, you got to fall through with  what you're going to say you're going to do. And when you do that, it's like a domino effect.  It's like, you just want to keep checking things off your list and you feel really good about  yourself.

I, I passed the part where, uh, the, the penny and the, the million dollars.  So are you, what percentage are you? Uh, 20, 25%. Nice. Phenomenal book guys. Um, I told you,  you can go type in slide edge PDF. You can get it for free at that. You could also go pay seven  bucks on Kindle or you could buy the, the, uh, the soft copy. I have all, I've read the book five  times. Um, it's a very simple book, but basically it just talks about this doing simple stuff.  And I'm telling you guys, and I said this before I even read this book this year,  I'd read the book in the past. My, my theme of 20, 25 is simplify and eliminate, right?  Get simple, eliminate the crap that doesn't matter. Okay. Get rid of all the extra fluff  and the meetings and the, this, that, and the rest and just focus on my core business  and growing it and being very simple and just doing it again and again and being really good at  it. And then I started reading this book and it just talks about, again, simplicity,  doing the little simple things every single day. And I promise you, they add up. So guys,  just one more plug, go check out this book. It's not my, not my, not my, I'm not getting  the commission on it, but it's a great book. Okay. Kevin Williams says business owner misses  the zoom call. What do you do? Porter, you've had this happen. Yeah, that's, that's a hard  conversation, especially when you think that they're solid. I mean, I would just message them,  say, Hey, Mr. Business owner. Like I, I see that you missed our call at such and such time. Like,  you know, I was really looking forward to chatting with you, but it seems like you're either,  you know, have enough work or maybe something came up. Like, please let me know so that we  can either reschedule or, you know, I just don't want to waste your time. So I think giving them  a little pullback, I mean, stuff does happen, like stuff emergencies do happen, but like very  rarely does it actually happen. Sometimes it's just, they're just blowing smoke, but you try to  give them the benefit of the doubt. Maybe they just need more time to think about it. But that's  what I like.

I'd rather sit,  tell you, have you tell me no than for me to just be, you know, just waiting on the zoom call day.  So I sent him a message and then he basically fired back and was like, Hey, I watched your video.  Like, I only want to do a paper lead model and whatever. So I was like, you know what? It's,  it's totally fine. Like, thanks for the conversation. We'll, we'll, we'll revisit this  later. So anyways, left it to that hook somebody else. But that's what I would say. Just have a,  have a conversation with them. I always try not to come out guns a blaze in the first text,  but like at the same time, you got to lay it across like, Hey, I'm looking to partner with  someone, whoever I partner with first, I'm going to go with. So if you want this, like let's  reschedule this for later today or, you know, really soon. Yeah. I think too guys, you need to  what's, what, how do I say this? Whatever you tolerate is what, what people will do to you,  right? It's, it's what you're going to receive. If I've sent you three leads  and I know you've quoted them, right. And you don't get on that call, dude, I'm, I'm pissed  and I'm not, I'm going to be a little more tactful than maybe what I'm saying right now, but  I'm, I'm not going to be super happy. I do this too. Like I've, like this happened about a week  and a half ago. This happens when with business owners happens with people that try to buy our  program. I think this, this was, I think again, about 10 days ago, we had this guy that whatever  he, he applied and then he traveled and whatever. And I, I told him, I said, I'm going to be on the  call just to say, hi, I want to meet you. And I literally had like planned my day. There was like  three, four calls that day that we had to do, but I shifted my calendar so I could be on the call.  And the guy, my team was like, yeah, he canceled. And I was like, give me this guy's number.  And I text him and I was like, Hey, this is Nick. I said, you missed the meeting. I don't, I'm not  sure why. And he's like, yeah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Gave me some reason. I said, look,  I said, I've, I literally, I moved my day around to be on this call. I said, the least you could  have done is like jumped on the call and give me an explanation, right? No pressure, but like,  that's not cool. That's how you do business. And the guy's like, yeah, you're right. Blah, blah,  blah. I just don't tolerate that. And so if somebody misses a meeting, it's, it's usually  indicative of how they're going to do business in the future. I'm not super interested in working  with people that can't get on a meeting. So, and I'll tell them that like, Hey, I've got other  people to work with. You're, your, your money spends the same money as freaking Susan's down  the street. And I'm like, I'm moving on.

Okay. Don't forget that.  Okay. Paul says, fake it till you make it. He says, kidding using the community sites  is legit. Oops. Being that you are using the same tactics and part of a network. He's talking about  using other people's sites. It's kind of for that first deal, by the way, if you are in digital  landlords, we have a thread in there. If you search for it with a bunch of people that have  listed their website and the name of the business owner and the deals, the deal size where you can  name drop some of these first deals to get your first day, you can name drop some of these other  deals. Okay. And that's true. That's part of the community that we should be leveraging. Okay.  Michael says, makes sense. That's, it's coming from my own personal issues of the consumer  needing proof, talking about his objection that he's getting about what needing, needing a reference  or seeing case studies or whatever. If you're sending leads, they shouldn't need it. That's the  fact. It's Kevin, the solid advice. Okay. Titus says, how can I find a business owner's name in  public records? The internet's wild guys. There's so many ways. If you just do some digging,  I will tell you that like we give specific strategies and techniques. I'm not sure if  Titus is inside digital lands. If you're in digital landlords and you go into module two, building  your list, we walk you through exact tactics. Okay. But if you're not, then some things that  I would recommend is here's a little hack. Go to Google, the Google listing or the Facebook listing  and look at the reviews and start reading through the reviews. A lot of times in the reviews,  these small businesses, the business owner's name will be mentioned in the reviews, right?  The person will be like, we had a phenomenal time with Carlos was really great. He was really  professional. And then the next one's like, awesome job. Had a good exchange with Carlos. I see Carlos  like three, four times, right? So then I start going, okay, Carlos. So I type in the business  owner's name plus Carlos. And all of a sudden, there pops his name. Now I got his name. Then  I'm into Facebook. I'm looking at what he's into, blah, blah, blah. And I'm down the wormhole.  That's just one way of finding the business owner's name. But guys, there's so many tools out there.  You have freaking, I mean, with AI, unbelievable. By the way, I just barely got done. My buddy works  at Google. He's on one of the, he's on the AI, one of the AI teams at Google here in London.  And the kind of money that Google is putting into AI right now is mind-bending. It is freaking  mind-bending because ChatGPT is posing a real threat to Google's main product, which is Google  Ads. I don't know if you guys knew this, but Google Ads, and I literally just confirmed this  with him. He's like, their main revenue stream is Google Ads, okay? So anything that's a threat to  Google Ads, they're going to try and protect. And so ChatGPT, where people are going in and asking  ChatGPT questions, it's pulling away from people searching in Google. So that's why they came out  with Gemini.",

Because as soon as you get to objection overcoming and you start trying to  do your techniques, your tie-downs and stuff, they're very quickly like, no, I don't want to  do it. Just as in door-to-door sales, whatever. I will tell you, we've worked with business  owners in the past that are women. We have one right now that's a client that is a woman. Great  business. Been working with them. I think they're in Colorado. I think I snuck one in the springs,  but not going to tell you about it. My hometown, dude.  Porter gets this deal. That's going to put Porter at $1,200 per month. For those of you that are  just starting, Porter, two and a half years ago, Porter didn't know how to run Google ads. He  didn't know how to build a website. He didn't know anything about SEO. He didn't even know how  to get on Zoom, nor did I. Literally. Yeah. Actually, we're still having problems with Zoom.  If you're struggling getting your first deal, you're over-complicating the process.  Literally just the other day, Porter, when he was telling me about this deal,  I asked him, I said, hey, is this somebody that got an existing website? Is this whatever he's  pre-selling? He's like, I'm just following the training. I'm like, yeah, go figure.  You get your first deal sometimes, guys, and you just think you're smarter than the process. The  process is the process for a reason. The process works. I use this example in the training.  It's like a perfect recipe for baking a cake. Sometimes we build a cake or we bake a cake,  aka we get a deal, and we think, hey, instead of adding the flour here, I'm going to wait until  it's mixed, and then after the milk, I'm going to put the flour in. You forget that there's a reason  why you put the flour in before you do the milk or whatever the case is. There's a reason why  I made the recipe exactly like I made the recipe is because it freaking works. If you don't think  I've tried putting in the chocolate chips at the beginning, then you're crazy because I've tried  all the different combinations, and I'm constantly trying to figure out, hey,  how can we make the same cake in a shorter period of time? How can we make the same cake  with cheaper ingredients? That's why I spent 10,000 bucks on Google Ads from a guy who it  didn't even work. It",

So anyway, Porter, by the way, we also are pitching a deal today. I'm not doing it.  Francesca's doing it. It's not going to be huge. I think it's going to be probably between 500  and 1,000 bucks a month for excavation. I'm not sure I would recommend the niche. We had a referral.  We built it a few years ago, and the guy only had one piece of equipment, and I don't remember  exactly how we lost. We ended up only keeping it for three to six months. Websites have been  sitting there. It's pumping out a few leads. So me and Francesca were getting scrappy. We were like,  dude, we've got to sell some of these websites that are not making money. So we started doing  some Facebook little techniques, and sure enough, dude, we already sent a lead over on the weekend,  guys coming in to meet with Francesca in person, and then she's going to send a screencast. So  we're going for an excavation deal, and then we're going for another deal that I can't tell  you guys the niche because I want to make sure it works, but it could be a very lucrative niche  that you guys have not thought of. So that's the plan. And by the way, I'm not doing any of these  deals myself. This is just me advising Francesca. So hopefully we snag at least one of these deals  this week. So anyway, I can't remember who said they were in. Was it Francesca who said he's in  UK? Let me double check. Francesca, if you're the one that's in the UK, dude, hit me up. I'm here for  another day or two. Let me just see if I can find that. I think it was him.  Yeah, he's in the UK. Beautiful. Yeah, shoot me a message on school. We'll talk about Google Ads.  I'm here. Maybe if I have time, we can meet up for coffee or something. But I am in London for  the next day and a half and I'm going to Paris. So anyway, guys, one last thing real quick.  Starting next week, I'm going to be doing these Q&As slightly different. I'm either going to have  a theme, a Q&A theme. So I'll say, hey, this is all sales Q&A, or I'm going to do a little bit of a  training with a specific topic for the first half and then we can ask questions going off of that.  OK, so you can come with any questions that you want, but I'm going to try to send out a reminder  email Sunday night to remind you guys that, hey, Monday morning, we're going to be doing the live  get on it. And this is the topic that we're going to be training on. Then you guys can jump on and  we can go over that specific topic. So anyway, guys, that said, happy Monday, happy March. Go  over your goals. Review what happened in February. If you fell short, make your course corrections.  And we got one more month and quarter one is done. And then we got three quarters left in the game,  baby. That's it. So anyway, thanks for jumping on Porter. See you guys. Yep. We'll see you guys.",

    "pageContent": " Guys, before we get into the Costco sample strategy too heavily, I want to remind you  that every single thing that we have done up to this point leads to this moment.  The reason that this process works is because we give results in advance.  We give people value and the goal is to give more value than they can pay for.  We want to give our free stuff, we want to make it better than their paid stuff.  There's no coincidence that that's what I'm doing in the free group.  I'm trying to give this as an example.  I'm trying to show you guys if you give free value that's better than most people's paid,  people will buy.  That's the reason you're here.  I don't want to overwhelm you.  I don't want to freak you out.  I don't want you to overthink it, but I do want you to remember everything leads here  and I've seen a few people in the past.  They've done everything right up to this point.  They've hooked the business owner and they think the deal is done.  They think it's over.  Guys, it is not over.  You do not skip this step.  You do not gloss over this step.  You do not do this step differently than I'm going to teach you.  There is a correct way to send these samples.  There is an incorrect way to send these samples and I've done all of them.  I've tried all of them.  Trust me.  I'm going to teach you the way and some of you guys are going to listen to this way and go,  oh man, that takes a couple of steps.  Yes, it does, but it's going to speed the deal up.  It's going to overcut.  I'm going to get into all that in a moment.  I just want to stress the importance that this step is so important and this isn't a  super long module, but I want you to do this exactly as I teach it because this is key  to everything.  First of all, what I want to talk about is what is the Costco sample strategy?  Why do we call it that?  Costco is what they call a big box retailer.  Basically, for those of you that don't know, it's like a huge grocery store,  but the difference is you go in, they sell huge quantities.  Instead of selling a candy bar, they sell packs of 30 candy bars.  Instead of selling cheese, they sell bricks of cheese.  Instead of selling laundry detergent, they sell cases of it.  You have to have a membership and all this stuff, but what they do is on Saturdays,  every single Saturday, you can go in and at the end caps in different places throughout the store,  they position these booths.  These booths have these different products that they're trying to sell.  It's juice, it's cheese, it's sausage, it's bread.  They stick somebody behind these booths and all they do is they cook this food or they  pour these drinks and they hand samples out.  These people don't have sales experience.  These people are typically seniors who are literally just trying to make enough money  to live.  They're not high energy, young salespeople.  These are just people just doing their job, handing out samples.  I don't even think they train them on sales experience at all.  I don't think they train them at all.  Okay, but Costco's figured out that if you have a product that is good,  if you have a juice that tastes amazing, all you got to do is get people to try it  and they will buy, okay?  And it is exactly what we're doing, right?  We know our",

    "pageContent": "product's amazing, but we got to get people to try it.  And we want to do it with no risk.  We don't want them to have to pay for it in advance.  We want them to try it without having any type of payment without any type of risk, okay?  So that is why we call it the Costco sample strategy.  We are going to give the samples, okay, without asking for anything in advance.  We're just going to give them results in advance.  And this does a couple of things that I want to go over really quick.  The number one thing that doing this does is it overcomes the objection of trust.  I'm telling you guys, after having done sales for almost 10 years now,  the number one objection that's going to kill deals is trust.  If someone can't trust you, they will not buy, period.  And I could say that 100 times and I probably wouldn't say it enough.  You can do everything correctly.  You can have the perfect product.  They can need it.  They can want it.  They can have the budget.  Everything can make sense, but if they don't trust you, they will not buy.  If there is any doubt in their mind that your service is going to work,  they will not buy, okay?  So by sending these results in advance,  it is the quickest, fastest way to overcome the objection of trust.  And a lot of people think that the way to overcome trust is having a fancy website,  you know, having these little blurbs of customer testimonials at the bottom,  having reviews.  Guess what, guys?  I have never had an agency website.  And I've worked with companies doing $500 million in a year, okay?  They own multiple companies under their umbrella  and they have never looked at my website.  And you know why?  It's because I overcome the objection of trust by giving them results in advance, okay?  Those of you that are in this program watching this,  notice we never had a landing page.  Notice there's no page that has the fancy this and the fancy that  and it's laid out and it's sponsored by this  and it's approved by this and a stamp of approval by that.  You guys know that this works because you have seen how good my free content is  and so it only makes sense that my paid stuff is that much better, okay?  So the number one thing that this does by sending the results in advance  and by doing the Costco sample strategy is it overcomes the objection of trust.  The second thing that it does is it demands,  actually it demands and commands attention, okay?  Because no one else is doing it.  Nobody else is doing it and especially the way that we do it, okay?  I had one of our students, we recently interviewed her  and she said something to the effect that she got talking to this business owner  and she said, hey, you know, we do leads, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And the business owner cut her off and said, yeah, everybody does leads now.  Home advisor does leads and this and she said, yeah,  but do they give you free results in advance before they ever ask for a dollar?  And the business owner just kind of stopped  and didn't really know what to say and said, well, no, okay?  Guys, you have to realize and I think sometimes we forget because we do it  and we do it so often, we are literally giving them liquid gold,  not liquid gold, digital gold, right?  We're giving them jobs that if you're in the right niches  can be worth and are worth thousands and thousands of dollars, okay?  So",

    "pageContent": "second thing it does, it commands and demands attention.  The third thing this does, it shows the business owner,  we're not messing around, we mean business, we're calling them  and we are giving them results in advance, we mean business,  we're here to do a deal, we're not here to mess around,  we're not here to play around, we are here to get it done.  And so those three things are what allows the deal to be sped up,  it's what allows us to overcome the trust  and it's what allows the business owner to know, hey, this guy, this girl, this lady,  they're messing around.  Last thing guys, we are going to be doing these Costco samples live, okay?  We are not gonna be doing a text message,  we're not gonna be doing an email,  we sure as hell aren't gonna forward the calls directly to them in the beginning,  we are going to be doing these live, okay?  And the reason why we do it live is because we,  I personally and many of our students have experiences in the past  where they hear of this concept, they're like, yeah, that makes sense.  You give people results up front and you go and close them.  What happens is if you do this incorrectly and you just send over the leads  or you just forward the leads,  you'll jump on the call, the Zoom call at the end  and you're jacked, you're like, dude, I've sent 20 leads to this guy,  20 leads to this lady, she's gonna be closed.  You get on and you find out they've gotten a hold of one,  they've gotten a hold of two  and they haven't even given estimates to those two yet  or they've scheduled estimates  but they haven't even gone out to the estimates.  And literally, it doesn't, like you sending the 20 leads did nothing, okay?  And so the reason that we do it live  is it allows us to control the entire process, okay?  It allows us to hand them a hot lead.  It allows us to hand it off so they don't say something wrong.  It allows us to show them exactly what they're getting, okay?  And so doing this live is such an important piece of this puzzle.  We're gonna get into that later  and if you can't do it live and if you have a job, that doesn't matter.  We have solutions around that  but I do wanna tell you, if at all possible, we want to do these live.  Doing this live is the equivalent of Costco.  This is something they don't do.  This is the one thing I think they could do even better  is imagine if Costco that gives these free samples,  imagine if they came and they said,  hey, you can have this sample, this cookie is free,  this drink is free, this cheese is free  but you need to stand right there and I need to watch you eat it.  And that'd be a little bit weird  but the truth is sometimes I remember and I still do this,  I'll go and I'll grab the sample and then I'll kind of smell it  or I'll look at it or I'll give it to my kid or I'll throw it away  and if I don't taste it, I'm never gonna buy it, okay?  So it's almost like a waste of the sample  but if Costco said, hey, you can have a sample,  in fact, I'll give you three of them  but I want you to try them.  I want you to eat them right here  so I can see that you taste it, that you can try it, okay?  Because",

    "pageContent": "if your product is good, it's gonna sell itself  but they have to try it.  And so the reason that we do it live  is it forces the business owner to try and to taste our samples  and what's crazy and what's cool is we actually know  they're already in the market for this, okay?  This is like somebody already being in the market for cheese  and somebody at Costco being like,  hey, I know you're looking to buy cheese, come try this one, okay?  They don't do that, they give every sample to everyone.  We're only giving our samples to people that are looking  and already paying for a product or service similar, okay?  So just before we jump into this,  I wanna stress the importance.  Do not skip this step.  This step is an absolute game changer.  Doing it correctly is a game changer.  Don't breeze through this, don't rush through this,  don't think that the deal is done, it is far from done.  Do this correctly and we will close deals  and we'll close them fast.",

    "pageContent": " Alright guys, it's time to jump in to the core content.  It's time to get in, pick our city and niche and get going and get deals coming in and  close that first deal.  But I want to share really quick, this is how I want you to attack the content, okay?  I know I've been in other programs where they tell you, hey, watch the whole thing and then  come back and watch it again and do it.  I know I've been in other programs that just tell you all sorts of different things and  I'm not telling you that.  Here's what I want you to do.  I want you to watch a module, okay?  So we start with module one and then I want you to do the thing.  So module one talks about picking the city and picking the niche.  So you're going to watch that module and then you're going to pick the city and the niche.  And you're not going to go to module two until that's done, okay?  Then once you've picked the city and the niche because you've done the homework and the whole  deal, then you're going to go to module two and you're going to learn how to build a list.  And guess what?  You're going to build a list before you go to module three and you're not going to go  to module three until you build the list.  Because what I know is that in the times I have just gone and gone through all the content,  what happens is I listen to all this and I'm like, oh, cool, well, I'm just kind of like  passively soaking things in and I'm like, I get done, I'm like, oh my gosh, that's a  lot, that's a lot.  But if you take it in bites and you watch the first module and you don't allow yourself  to go to the next one until you've done the thing, done the actual action step, you have  a lot more, you go a lot quicker because you're just, you're tacking it in chunks, okay?  So I do want you to watch the module and then do it.  And then watch the next one and then do it.  And then watch the next one and then do it.  Because then by the time we get to module seven, we are pitching the business owner,  okay?  And we're getting a deal.  That is my advice.  Another little piece, I've had people that have gone through all of this in one day.  My recommendation is to watch a module a day and consume this over a week's time or maybe  even a little bit longer.  It's up to you, but I've had students that have literally watched every module in one  day and I'm telling you right now, even though it's my own stuff, I would probably want to  blow my brains out and I probably wouldn't retain much by the end of the day.  So I think the very best way to do this is watch a module and do it and do one module  a day and do it well, okay?  So guys, let's freaking do this.  Let's jump into module one, watch it, and then do it.",

    "pageContent": " How can I sell a hooked business owner within consistent leads, working on the first deal?  Trey, this time of year, it's all in the setup. This time of year, and for anyone listening,  this is what you need to do, at least from now until it gets to be about spring,  you need to make sure not to pigeonhole yourself. What I mean by that is if you call a business  owner, you hook them and you go, hey, I'm going to get you three leads, and then we're going to  talk in three days. Well, guess what? If you don't get three leads, you look like a dumbass.  So what I do at this time of year is I call the business owner, I'm just really open about it.  I'm like, hey, I'm going to get you a couple of leads. It might be in a couple of days,  it might be in a couple, it might be a week, it might be 10 days. I want to get you a couple  really good ones. So let's talk once I do that. And I just leave it at that. That way, I'm not  pigeonholed into it. But typically, the question you're asking, I'm guessing what happened is you  call the business owner, you hook them, and you're like, hey, I'm going to get you a couple of leads,  and you almost made it sound like you're going to have them three leads in three days,  which during the spring, winter, or spring, summer, and fall might be realistic. And it's  like, okay, it's winter. And now the business owner, you're like, shit, is the business  thinking I'm just lying? Does the business owner think I'm full of shit? Whatever.  And so that's the position you're in. So for the specific deal that you're doing,  and maybe you're referencing a deal that you have hooked, you're going to need to just get  gritty, man. You're going to need to go, and what I would do is use some of the Facebook strategies,  go into groups, go into those cities, and search for specific keywords, and see if there's anyone  you can just kind of hustle for. That's what I would do for that specific deal. And if you  have more context that you can share on this thread or DM me, let's talk about it. But I'm  talking about for future deals from now until the spring. Guys, don't pigeonhole yourselves.  Don't make it sound like you're going to get them three leads in 24 hours or in three days  when you don't know. Okay? Keep it open. They don't know that you've given other clients,  they don't know that you gave somebody two months ago three leads in 24 hours or three leads in  three days. They don't have any context. So it's not a big deal. If it's not a big deal to you,  it's not going to be a big deal to them. So if you're talking about a deal you already have hooked,  then my advice would, you're going to have to do some strategies, and you can message me or  comment here or post in the group, because I know a lot of us have talked about these last winter.  But for deals going forward, and this is for everybody, don't pigeonhole yourself in. Do  not pigeonhole yourself in. Do not make it seem like you're going to get three leads in three days.  Just keep it, whatever. Hey, I'm going to get you a couple of leads and then let's talk.  Okay? It might be a couple of days. It might be a week. It might",

    "pageContent": " back to your question that you had for me, which is this tree service deal. So he's wanting to do  600 bucks a month. How much are you doing with ads? 20 bucks a day? Yeah. So we wouldn't make  anything for the first three months. The thing is, he's a killer business owner. The dude's  crushing it. And so I know he's going to like, that's why he closed that one lead. I mean,  I know he's going to close deals. It's just like, really, like for me, it's kind of, to me, it makes  sense. It's like, yeah, I'm not going to make anything for these three months, but for one,  once I get his site ranked and for two, if I do what I say I'm going to do, he's, he's going to  pay me more. Do you think he would have any, would he, would he wiggle at all? If you said, hey bro,  I'm actually going to be spending like that or more than that in ads. Could you do, I was going  to come back at six 50. Yeah, I would. So here's what I would do is I would go to him and I would  just be straight up with them and I'd say, Hey, look, just so you know, the, the long-term strategy  is be like, I don't want to go too in depth, but long-term strategy, we're going to get you  ranked on page one. Okay. And what's going to happen? What's his name? Mark. You ready for  his last name? Yeah. Ingram, Mark Ingram. Of course. We're about to sign on Mark Ingram.  I love it, dude. You're going up to celebrities. So, okay, Mark. So this is what I was,  this is the exact conversation. I say, Mark, so here's the strategy. We're going to rank you  long-term just so you understand that this works. Once you're ranked, it's not going to cost me near  as much to get these leads in the interim while we're ranking. I'm literally going to be spending  $20 a day. And the way that Google does it, it's $20 times 30.4. It's going to cost me $608  just to run the ads. It's not even including my time. So Mark, what if we did this? What if you  help me out a little bit? What if we do this? And I would, I would go higher. I would say,  what if we do something at like just a three month deal? We do it for 800 bucks a month. You  know exactly how much I'm making. And at the end of the three months, if you can help me get a  Google My Business, which I just need an address and whatever, whatever, whatever, my goal would  be to help get us ranked organically. That's the play. And then as we start to get some organic  leads, then I'll try my very best to keep that price at or around 800, even once we're ranking.  So I would just shoot him straight and be like, dude, at that price, I would love to do it,  but I'm not going to make, I'm actually going to lose money. And that's not even including my time.  However, if you would be down and you, you know, have a good feeling about this partnership,  give me a little bit more. So I have a little bit to cover my time and let's do a three month deal.  We'll do everything we can to get you leads. And also it's going to pick up because the season's ",

I hit him at like  800 and just hit him and say, dude, I'm going to be, my hard cost of this thing, $608 without  even paying for hosting or my time. So you're going to tell them that. And then just, would you,  would you though, like, would you like, if they're like not, not budget, would you stay, would you go  with a, would you do that other deal though? I might do that other deal. And then what I would  might do is I might bump the ads down to like $15 a day. And then I would just, you know,  do everything that I could to get the Google My Business listing going, get it going. And I mean,  I'd have to be making a little bit of money to make it worth my time. But yeah, if he agrees  to 600, cool. Like then I'll drop the budget to, you know, $15 a day and, and focus on my ads or  whatever and just get, you know, Google My Business. So yeah, I mean, but you can DM me,  we can talk a little bit more. I'll get a little more context, but that's, I would first start at  the 800 mark and just explain. And everyone gets weird. They're like, Oh, I don't want to tell the  business owner that I'm running ads. Dude, who cares? It's like, was this guy running ads when  you called him? Yo, he's spinning, like he did this to see the heart that he's like all he he's  canceling some newspaper ads. So he's spending a lot, like it ain't the money. That's not the  objection. It's, it's, and I understand, cause it's, it's just been so slow. He's worried about  spending 800 a month and only getting three leads. So say this, or you could say this,  you could say, you could do something like this. You could say, let's do a hybrid. Let's do,  let's do a six month deal. We'll do $600 for the next three months. And then the last three months,  assuming that this picks up, let's bump it up to a thousand and you could do some kind of like a  escalated like a contract. Okay. Yeah. No, not, but, or the hybrid is, let's just do 800 across  the board. And you're going to get a few less leads for the next three months,  but you're going to get a lot more than that last three, but I'm not going to charge you more.  Yep. So cool. That makes sense.",

    "pageContent": " Guys, I'm going to ask you to become private investigators at this stage of the list building  process.  So what we're going to do here is now that we've built a list of multiple business owners  paying for Google Ads, Home Advisor, Angie's list, Angie's leads, whatever it's called,  and on and on and on.  Now what we want to do is we want to go and find specific pieces of information about  this business owner so that when the leads come in and we go to make the call, when we  go to make the hook, we have specific information about this individual that's going to give  us, and it's going to increase our chances of getting the deal.  Biggest piece of information that we need is we want the business owner's full name  and cell phone if possible.  Because there's a huge difference when you call in, and let's say you hit a secretary,  or let's say you call them specifically and you call in and you say, Hey, is this the  business owner?  When you call and say, Hey, is this the business owner?  Sounds sketchy.  It sounds scammy.  It sounds salesy.  Okay.  But if you call and you say, Hey, is this Mike?  Sounds way different, right?  You call the secretary and say, Hey, can you pass me over to Mike?  This is Nick.  Sounds way different than, Hey, is the business owner in?  Right?  Totally different.  So what we're going to do in this module, or sorry, this lesson, not module, this specific  lesson is we're going to find specific pieces of information about this business owner.  And some of you guys are going to go, man, this is a lot like to look up.  Yes, it is.  But no one else is willing to do this stuff.  And that's why we're doing it.  So I'm going to have you jump over to the screen with me.  Okay, guys, here is what we're going to do.  I'm going to show you.  And again, as we've talked about this specific city, there wasn't a lot of people paying  for Google ads.  And I just want to show you how we find this information.  So I didn't build out the full list.  I'm still going to go for it simply because it's such low hanging fruit and the position  I'm in.  So it's totally fine.  But I want to show you with this McDowell landscaping old Mike, how we're going to find  information.  Now, the only reason I know it's Mike, going back to the previous videos, because his voicemail  said it was Mike, if it didn't, what we'd have to do is start getting creative.  And so one thing I want the first thing is, as far as finding the business owner's name,  because I think that is super important.  And that's a good starting point is finding their name is I like to check the website,  obviously.  Okay, so go to the website.  I like to check the about page.  And if that that's usually an easy place to find it.  So kind of scan here, that that that that I don't see anything, Mike, I'm going to search.  Yeah, I don't see.  Okay, that's funny.  So I don't see anything on the about section.  But because I knew what the name was, I control after it, which is, you know, you could search  the thing.  And one of the reviews said, you know, Mike right here.  So you can look at their reviews on the website.  But that was the next thing",

    "pageContent": "that I was going to say is I like to go to their Google reviews.  And you can really easily read inside the Google reviews.  And people like to act like they know the business owner.  They love acting important, and whatever.  So they'll always say, we hired Mike to expand our patio.  So maybe it's Mike, maybe that's the crew member, I don't know, okay, Mike and the McDowell  landscaping team.  Oh, okay.  So his name is Mike, Mike and his crew.  So we can pretty quickly see that his name is Mike, okay, so Mike McDowell, really simple.  That's how I usually find the business owner name.  Next thing I like to do is I like to find their Facebook page.  So right here, this one was easy.  It just popped up.  So McDowell landscaping, you can tell it's the same, make sure they're in it's the right  city and everything matches up.  So click on this, and I'm just going to drop it over here into the Facebook page.  Okay.  What else?  Facebook, let's see, email, let's grab the email, I didn't see it on the site, nope,  but usually it is on the Facebook page.  So go to the about section, I think, on here, or it's just under the home, yeah, home, look  at that.  And it also says in his email, Mike M, like he's just given it to us, super easy.  This one's very simple.  We've definitely had some other ones that have been more difficult, which I'll go over  here in a moment.  Current position, you can honestly skip that, I might even take that out.  That's kind of where they're ranking, but they weren't ranking, so I don't need that.  Only other thing I would like to add is the business owner Facebook profile.  I think it's very interesting to find their profile, their Facebook profile, and just  learn one or two things about them.  You can learn a lot about someone based on their Facebook profile.  So how do we find the Facebook profile?  Well, first thing you're gonna do is you could just simply search it, okay, so you could  go Mike McDowell, okay, and that's got a lot of options, so I would type in the term landscaping  as well and see if that pulls it up, okay.  Nothing here.  Okay, I'm actually glad this is doing this so I can show you how to find this, okay.  It's not pulling anything up, right?  So here's a really easy way to find the, not an easy way, but a good way, and sometimes  it takes a little bit of work.  One way that you can find the business owner's personal Facebook profile, if they have one,  is I like to go to the Facebook page, okay, and as we know, Facebook pages suck.  They're not fun to look at, no one follows them, whatever, right?  So one thing you can do is you can go to the Facebook page, make sure it is the same one,  and then go down and look at their posts, and I want you to look at people that are  liking their posts, okay.  First of all, they typically are the only ones that like their own posts, so I'm gonna  look for McDowell, nope, okay, so there's no one with the last name McDowell that liked  it, sometimes the mom, the wife, whatever, will like it over and over, but I want to  pay attention to these names, and I'm gonna start looking for commonalities, the people  that",

This is for a patio cover and we're going to just kind of show you how we set that up.  So the big thing that we use to set that up as we go through the training is what your  CPC is and bidding your CPC using tools like the Keyword Planner here is where we go and  we learn how much the keywords are going to be and that will typically set us up for what  our daily budget will be.  When you go and you set up your ad and you set up your daily budget, you will have like  right here we set up our daily budget of $45 a day and that was based on what our CPC was  going to be and what we wanted to do for that area.  So you can see here that this gives me a bunch of different options which anywhere from $23.26  all the way up to $292 a day and it will give you how many clicks to expect and the cost,  the impressions and how much to get to the top impression.  So that is one way to look at it.  We try to keep it between typically between $25 to $35 a day.  This area is San Antonio, Texas so it's a little bit more but you can see here that  we've been getting good results at $45 a day for our client and you can see here that Google  is wanting to push us all the way up to $300 a day.

    "pageContent": " As I said in the beginning, if you're going to run ads, you're just going to need to go  ahead and expect and accept the fact that you are going to have an ad suspension.  Okay?  And if you're watching this video just to watch this video and you haven't had one yet,  no problem.  It's totally fine.  I've had people that have seen people have ad suspensions and they ask, and it's a good  question.  They say, hey, what can I do?  What are the top two or three things I can do to avoid ad suspensions?  Okay?  My advice is don't worry about it.  Okay?  Now don't do something stupid.  And if you see somebody comment on something, like try your best to avoid it.  But what I'm telling you right now is that it happens to everybody.  It really does.  For example, I have run a one point, at this point, time I'm recording this, $1.2 million  in ads.  Okay?  It took me four years to get an ad suspension.  Four.  Okay?  And I had actually spent over a million dollars.  And I was like, you know what?  I'm good.  I'm not going to get the suspension, whatever.  And I got four in one single day after spending a million dollars.  So Google doesn't, it's not a respecter of persons as they say in the Bible, right?  They don't care.  They don't care how much money you spend.  They don't care who you are.  They're going to suspend you at some point.  And here's my theory is Google, and you got to look at it from Google's perspective, right?  Google's a massive company.  We talked about this a little bit at the beginning.  They're trying to protect their own butts, okay?  You can't really blame them.  So I just want to say, number one, it's going to happen.  And so the first thing is, when this happens, I want you to, if you're watching this video  because you just got a suspension, take a deep breath, okay?  Breathe in, exhale, and realize you ain't special because everybody deals with them,  okay?  So just realize everyone dealt with them.  Up until this point, and at the time of recording, I know we have a couple students that are  currently under some suspensions, but I, to my knowledge, okay, again, to my knowledge,  at the time of recording, with how many students, I don't even know how many students we have  right now, but we have not had one student that's come into this program that has had  a suspension that we have not been able to find a solution for, okay?  And for the people that are in one right now that are going to watch this going on, oh,  that's me, I'm going to be the one, I promise you're not going to be the one.  You're not going to be the one because we haven't had that happen with anyone.  You are going to go through it, it's going to happen, and the way I look at it is two  ways.  Number one is once you get through it, I've seen that Google doesn't hit you again with  a suspension.  Typically, it's like they give you the suspension, you get through it, and they're like, okay,  that guy, that girl, she's good.  That's a real business because they appealed that many times.  No fake clown would do that.  They're good, we're going to let them through.  I haven't",

I didn't learn my lesson, I didn't get slapped on the wrist and go, oh, I'm not going to  do this or that because Google doesn't even know what you did wrong.  You go ask their people, you get on a hold of their team, which is almost impossible,  they can't even tell you.  Take a deep breath, relax.  Everyone's been through it.  No one's not gotten through it.  There's always a solution.  I promise you that.  Let's talk about these suspensions just really briefly.  I want to talk about the two types of suspensions really, really quick.  Number one suspension is, well, it's not in any order, but what you're going to see more  often than not is the suspicious payment suspension, which happens to be a little bit more difficult  to unsuspend from, at least compared to the second suspension type, which is something  around circumvention.  They'll say, hey, you circumvented systems or circumvented this.  I don't even remember the verbiage, but they're going to tell you, you got some kind of circumvention.  Those are the two things.  Most people that are watching this, most people are going to have some kind of suspicious  payment suspension.  Guys, what you're going to do if you do have a suspension.  The game is really, you just want to make sure there's nothing weird.  Some of the things that when I say weird that I've seen is, let's say three years ago, and  if any of these trigger thoughts, oh yeah, yeah, that's me, go and fix these things.  I know we had a student that years and years ago, they had set up an ad really quickly  and they're like, oh crap, I forgot about it.  They went, they checked it out, and there was a balance of literally like $2, or maybe  it was even like 20 cents.  They went and they paid it, and then a couple days later, a couple appeals later, voila,  they're going.  That's one thing I've seen.  Other thing is, I've seen people, they've used weird cards.  They've had cards on multiple accounts.  What I would tell you with suspicious payments is we need to diagnose the problem.  If you have multiple accounts, go and check all of those.  Make sure there's no balances that are outstanding.  It might be something as dumb as 20 cents.  Who knows?  Then also, how many accounts, how many Google ad accounts is your card linked to?  I know that it seems like, again, I don't know, but it seems like that seems to be a  big factor.  What I want to tell you not to do, what I don't want you to do, the first thing is do  not go and create another ad account.  Do not go and create another ad account.  You think Google is that stupid.  They understand how people operate.  They know how people think.  That is not going to do anything.  Don't go and create another ad account.  All that you're going to do is you're going to try and make sure there's nothing else  that's weird out there, no extra accounts, no outstanding balances.  Ask yourself, what kind of a card am I using?  Am I using some weird one-off card, whatever, some prepaid visa, whatever it is.  I don't even think they would allow that.  Go and close all those things up.  What you're going to do is you're just going to",

You're just going to do this process and I know that you're going to be like, oh my gosh,  this sounds terrible.  It is.  It sucks.  You're going to do this process and I have seen, there's one student I can think of off  the top of my head, they did this seven times before finally Google's like, okay, you win.  Here you go.  You're good.  Until you've gone seven, eight, I would venture to say, until you've appealed 10 times and  you're still running into the same thing.  Keep appealing.  Now, if you're not doing anything and you have accounts that are out there and you haven't  checked to see if there's any weird stuff, then yeah, you might appeal forever, but as  long as you shut all that down and go and check that and go do a very thorough, what  would be the word?  You want to go and just make sure, an audit, a thorough audit of accounts that you may  have set up.  Try and think.  Was there a time when you watched a video in another group and they told you to go do  and you wouldn't set up this ad account and think like, what emails?  What I do is I go and search on my phone, I have all these emails linked up, I go and  search Google ads or payment successful and I look, oh, and I look at the email, it said  it too.  Oh, it looks like I had my ad account set up under that email and the reality is in  this business, we set up a lot of emails, we have a lot of burner emails, we have a  lot of accounts and it kind of sucks and if you're not good at organization, you can get  stuff kind of spread out, go and shut all that down and you're just going to appeal.  You're going to fill it out properly.  You're going to appeal.  You're going to fill it out properly.  You're going to appeal.  You're going to fill it out properly.  You're going to appeal.  And",

If those don't answer your questions, reach out to people, make your own post, tag the  people that have gone through it.  I know there's people that have gone through the freaking wringer and they figured out  a way to get out of it, but what I would tell you is this.  If you want to get out of the suspension, you will get out of it.  If literally a Google ad suspension is enough to throw you off, maybe you should consider  the fact that maybe you're not cut out for this.  I love the fact that there's ad suspensions because I know it's going to eliminate half,  if not 75% of the people that want to be successful and they're going to have an ad suspension.  As soon as they get it, they're done.  They're not going to try to do the ad suspension because it's too much work and they just don't  want to deal with it and they're just going to stick with ranking and waiting six months,  not me.  I'm going to figure it out.  I'm going to get to the bottom of it and I'm going to go.  That's with the suspicious payment.  With circumventing, it's the same exact process.  Click the appeal, fill it out, send it.  It seems to me in my experience and talking to students, if you have a circumventing issue,  it seems to get appealed a lot quicker because it's more cut and dry whereas suspicious payments  kind of out there, but guys, you're just going to appeal.  You're going to fill it out.  You're going to appeal after you've closed any doors that are weird, cards that are on  multiple accounts, et cetera.  Guys, once again, when you get a suspension, take a deep breath, exhale, realize you're  not special.  Everybody deals with them.  I deal with them.  You deal with them.  Every single person deals with them.  We're going to get through it.  We're going to keep appealing.  It doesn't matter if it's going to take 10 times, we're going to appeal and then once  we get on the other side of the appeal, we're back in action.",

What I would be doing is if I have a couple ads live, I would be thinking like okay, and I'm gonna let you answer your own question but if I had if I was in that case, and let's say that like they're just not getting clicks and leads are coming in  whatever right.  I would be thinking, let's assume that once these start popping off, I'm going to have to, you know, I'm going to have to replace them right like what let's say I sell these two, these two deals that I'm that I'm running ads for.  What would then be your next steps. Okay.  You probably have to go and find more niches and cities and get those landing pages ready, and the ads ready. So what I would be doing if you're waiting it's like, have the next three or four in the pipe.  Okay, that's what I'd be doing. Okay. But for those of you that are in that situation I like to have if one of them you got one going, and there's nothing coming in, you're cool setting up another one and then once one of them starts to go pause the one focus on it  So that's what that's what I would personally do camera is like have the next few ready to go.",

    "pageContent": " And then it also, I think the other thing too, it depends how many leads have you sent him?  Is this your first lead? Is this your fifth lead? Because if I've already set this guy three,  four leads, you got to remember guys, you don't need to wait until they close a job,  until they close a lead to go and run the call, right? Like Porter, did that guy close any of  those deals you sent him? No, his estimates are today. So he hasn't even done one.  I was just going to say, and sometimes you're going to send them a few leads. They're not even  going to get to the leads and you're going to close them. And you could just tell one of the  reasons Porter, Porter's got a really good example right now of momentum, the power of momentum. You  get that deal and you get that second deal and you get that third deal and you get that fourth  deal. Then you get that fifth deal. And my guess is his sixth and seventh deal. He's two deals away  from hitting 10 K guys in two and a half, three months. So that question, Theo, it depends on what  lead number you're at. And if you're asking like, like, are you asking because you're worried that  it's going to sound like you're desperate or are you asking because you think you should just send  it before he actually talks to the homeowner? I'm not really sure what you're asking, but just  remember you don't need them to close a lead. You actually don't even need them to run the lead.  You just like, if it feels right, it feels right. And you just go for it. Okay.",

Let me show you. Well, I can just share my screen and show you this.  Okay, let's look at this.  Population, Queen Creek, Arizona is 59,000 a couple of years ago. Let's look at we say if we type in 2023.  Okay, 78,000. Let's do the same thing for Jacksonville, Florida, almost a million.  Okay, so let me just say this, Enon. The more population, usually the more business owners,  usually the more variables. And so I would go as far as to say that the lower population cities,  it's going to be more cut and dry. And that is why I mentioned in the training,  I have done very, very well in going into this as small of city as possible that still has the  search volume. So I start at the 50,000 or the 40,000, and then I look and I'll look at 20 cities  and find the one or two that actually have enough search volume. And then I'll start doing due  diligence instead of like my rule of thumb is if I look at a map, and I look at the map, and I look  at the map, and I look at the map, and I look at the map, and I look at the map, and I look at the  map, and I can see the city, everyone else can see the city, and that's probably on their list to  go and look at first. That makes sense? So I understand the frustration is like, well, obviously,  Nick, Queen Creek was cut and dry. Go look at cities between 50,000 and 80,000 across the US  in pavers, and you're going to see stuff that's a lot more cut and dry. The bigger the city,  the more competition, the more variables. And that's just the reality. Now, also in that same  breadth, usually the bigger the win. If you can get ranked, like I would love to see somebody that  has SEMrush, go and type in that Jacksonville paversfl.com. Go look at the amount of traffic.  I bet they're getting a hell of traffic because it's such a big city. But I'm telling you, Edward,  I would not be going into that city. It's too competitive. It's too big. The CPC is too high.  Okay. Hopefully, that answered your question, Ema.",

First and foremost, just to get really, we're  going to get right into it today. But one thing I wanted to say is I wanted to thank  everybody who was part of our beta test group. We appreciate you guys. I'm going to be bringing  Ryan on here in a second. We appreciate you guys putting trust in the product and knowing  we'll make sure that it's a great product. We're trying to implement. I'm giving Ryan feedback. I  hear you guys. I have my team working on it. We're trying to get as much feedback as possible.  It's not going to be perfect, but we're going to work our way towards it. We're going to allow you  guys to help us build this tool. And I'm going to be able to help take your feedback, give it to  Ryan, and create the best rank and rent tool on the internet. Okay? So anyway, I wanted to  let you guys know that we appreciate you guys being part of that beta test group.  And yeah, that's basically all I wanted to say before I bring Ryan on. I'm going to bring Ryan  Dalton, Mr. $87,000 per month. If you guys do not know Ryan Dalton, maybe you just joined the group.  Ryan joined back a little over two years ago and has scaled up to $87,000 per month. He is a master  of systems. He's a master of organization. And this was a perfect project for him to take all  of his skill sets and put it into creating the perfect tool, the only tool that you need.  And today, specifically, we're going to be talking about search volume and what the minimum search  volume needs to be for you to have confidence to go into a city, any niche. And on top of that,  we're also going to be answering questions, going into more of the tool itself for any of you guys  that had questions. I know we had the call earlier. I guess it was last night for you guys. It was  earlier today for me, and we had a bunch of really, really good questions. So any questions that you  have related to the software we want to answer, clear up, et cetera. We're going to talk about  search volume. And then if we have any time for anything else, we'll do that as well. So let me  bring Ryan on really quick and we will get going. Hold on. Three, two, one, admits.  And apparently, oh, there we go. We're working.  Yo. Can you hear me? Yeah, I got you. Beautiful. Okay. Ryan Dalton. Welcome to the call, dude.  Hey, everybody. Yeah, I know some people that they were on the call that was for me this morning.  This has been the longest day of my life. I got two hours and 11 minutes of sleep, exactly per  the watch here, per the whoop, two hours, 11 minutes. But I did get a little nappy on the couch.  Good to be back. We had Ryan on a few times and you guys should know who he is. If not, then you  guys need to be a little more active in the group. Mr. $87,000 per month joined a little over two  years ago, full-time job, family, kids, the entire thing, all the objections that people used to have  don't have time. I've got kids, blah, blah, blah. Ryan basically ruined that for all of you guys  because he's got all of those objections and he still did it. So",

    "pageContent": "anytime anyone tells me any of  these things, I just send them the interview with Ryan. I'm like, well, this guy did it. So it's  possible, which means it's possible for you. So what we're going to do today, guys, as I mentioned,  I want to get right into this. I want to specifically talk about search volume because  it's something that we've been talking about. We haven't been putting it off, but I've really  wanted to make sure we get it dialed in so that we don't give you guys bad advice or something  I'm not a hundred percent confident in. So over the past few weeks, since we launched this tool,  what's it been, Ryan, four and a half weeks, something like that? Yeah, about four and a half  weeks. I've been going in looking at not just one of my projects, but I've looked at like four or  five, six of my projects that are ranking very well consistently for years, looking at how many  leads they have. They're ranked really high, looking at what the tool says to them and then  saying, okay, if I was to make a guess, what's the minimum search volume that a city and niche has to  have? Okay. So anyway, Ryan, anything that you want to cover before we get started on that front  or anything that you want to chat on other than that? I just think it's a super important call.  This stuff is not static. I mean, it changes over time. So revisiting some of the fundamentals of  local lead generation is always a great way to spend some time. Search volume I've found  more and more with my agency is king, right? Where everything for me begins with search volume. So  having conversations about what people see as working and what isn't is very useful.  And search volume, guys, it's part of due diligence. And I will stand by this forever.  Due diligence is the most important step in the process, right? Because no matter how good you  are at sales, if you do a bad job on picking an area and there's no hungry business owners,  your life becomes very difficult. If you pick a really good city that's low competition,  great search volume, lots of hungry business owners, you could be a mediocre at best salesman,  not even a good salesperson, and you're going to get deals. So I truly believe that due diligence  is actually the most important step in the process. And this is part of due diligence. Now,  I did notice that there was a couple other questions like what about this, that, and the  rest. Some of those things, if we don't know the exact, we don't have a very solid answer yet per  the tool, because this is going to be our staple tool going forward, then I'm going to let you guys  know that. But specifically on search volume, we are going to address that today. Okay? So  really quick, though, just to welcome people in the call, we've got Simon, we've got Nicholas  Kudlick, we've got Beau, we've got Kevin Mijo, we've got Corey Gilbert, Mr. St. George Utah,  Ryan Martez, we've got JC Crozier, what's going on? We've got Jason Allred, Mr. Utah, Ryan,  the best example of F your excuses, a hundred percent. Corey says, Ryan Dalton, I have that  same safe. If you want to go shoot some Tannerite, let me know. Dude, let's go. Let's go, man. I put  some 556s and Tannerite with you. You guys and your Tannerite, dude. You know, it's funny. I  actually met Corey in",

    "pageContent": "person and we actually had the same conversation about Tannerite. So  I have a feeling he's got a few stacks of that stuff. It's good to have someone stand by. Yeah,  you have to. You have to. Okay. So guys, let's start with this. I want to start with how we  used to recommend the search volume. Okay. Now I want to go very basic. Search volume. And Ryan,  I know that for you, you do look at population a little bit. You've kind of kind of a slightly  different process. But for me, I kind of just go sheer like basically almost exclusively off of  search volume, because in my mind, it doesn't really matter. I do think population matters  to an extent because the bigger the population, typically the more competitive. Would you agree  with that? Yeah. I mean, certainly there's a correlation. I pay attention to population  insofar as I'm interested in if it's a growth area, right? Where maybe other people are not  looking because I'm able to look there and see like, all right, two years ago, this was the  population. Now it's this population. If it continues at this rate, it's this population.  And if there's people moving there, people building homes or whatever, that's going to  increase search volume over time and I can get in early. But aside from that, search volume is king  for sure. That's a good point. And when I disregard search or population, it's in the sense of like  I've been in other programs where they don't even talk about search volume. It's just like  go into a city with this kind of a population and that's it. I like what Ryan's saying and I'll give  you guys a good example. Bentonville, Arkansas, Bentonville concrete. You guys have heard me  share this example many, many times. Bentonville concrete was a very low population when I started.  The reason I was confident going into that city, guys, is because I had lived in that city for  three summers in a row and I had watched every summer that we came back. There was new  neighborhoods popping up everywhere and I had heard that Walmart had implemented this rule  that said if you want to sell to Walmart, if you are a vendor, if you are somebody that sells  jerky, for example, to Walmart, you have to have somebody from your office living in that city.  I'm like, okay, that means that if people are going to keep selling to Walmart, they have to  have somebody that lives in the city, naturally the city is going to keep growing. That was just like  an intuition gut instinct type of a decision that I made and I knew the area. I think that's really  important and we may end up adding that to the training. Real quick, how do you look at,  do you just go ahead and search population growth over the past five years for the specific city?  Yeah, so I'll use chat GPT and prompt it with a question about population growth and it'll  give me instances of cities that are growing. Then I also do what you do where I live in Tennessee  and I know which areas are growing because I know my area and then I know areas where friends live  and I just listen. I'm always thinking about local lead generation. They're talking about their new  you know move to some area in Tennessee and they're talking about how everyone's moving  there and how it's the new like little darling hotspot. I think probably a good spot for a site  and so I'll go look at that and see like, okay, the numbers are not quite what I want them to be  just on its face but I know this area is growing so I'm going to see what happens and",

    "pageContent": "usually turns  out pretty good. I like that. Give us an example. You don't have to give us too much your secret  sauce but when you say a prompt with chat GPT, what do you mean? Do you say, hey, what are some  of the areas, what cities in the US, what cities in the Midwest have a 200% increase in population  over the past five years like something like that? Yeah, you can't really go wrong with your prompt  if you're trying to get it population growth. I start pretty wide. I start just in the United  States and I say give me the suburbs in the United States that have the greatest population  growth over the last, over the previous two years and it'll think for a second and then it'll spit  out you know however many, right? I can tap it and say give me the most recent 20 and that's where  I'll start my due diligence, right? Where I'll look at, okay, these are growing and maybe these  are off the radar of other lean generators. They're not looking at these yet and that can  also filter by population size. So if I think that you know the population is too big and it's growing,  I could say give me populations under you know 100,000 and then I'll take that and plug it into  search volume tools and look at, okay, what is the actual search volume? Because I don't really care  like you said about population being like the metric. I want it to be what is the actual search  volume but I will start with is this an area that is trending because trending growth means  that there's people that are buying things. They have to build. They have to you know refurbish  homes. There's people that are probably going to invest in those markets that are looking to  replace their driveways and their brick and those kinds of things. So genius. I think that's really,  really smart. So anyway that's just something to think about guys. One other little wrinkle  and guys, the answer that we're going to come give you here in just a moment on the search volume  side per what RankinRent Engine says, there are going to be some caveats to it, okay?  So let's, I'm trying to think. I don't think we necessarily need to show this on the RankinRent.  So what I'll do, maybe I'll just discuss what I think is going to be the, I'm trying to think  what would be the best way if I could, do we think we need to show this or we could just kind of  discuss it and then we can get into the tool after? Yeah, let's talk through it and then we  can show it. Okay. So I'm going to pull up some of the metrics that I found. Let's see. Let me go to,  so here's what I did guys. All right there. So as I told you was I was coming up with this  and again, the thing that we're addressing is what, when you're doing your due diligence,  what is the minimum search volume that can give you the, at least in that area that says, hey,  I know at the very least there's going to be enough volume because some of the issues that  people run into is they go into a city, it looks good, it's low competition, it's the right niche,  you know, whatever, and they start running ads and they get a couple leads and then it's like,  it just dies, right? Or I don't know, have you ever had this happen, Ryan? You build a website,  you rank it and you're still only getting like 10 leads and you're like the number one person.  Have you ever had that happen",

    "pageContent": "or have you never gone to a city that has that low search? Many  times, many times. And the mistake, the number one mistake that I made when that's happened  is I get impatient and I need it. I did that in, I'll just say, I did that in Selena, Texas,  the suburb of, I think it's the Dallas, Fort Worth area. And it was not getting what I wanted. I  thought it's going to go great. And I just got impatient and I was like, I'm not renewing this  domain. I'm getting rid of this domain. I don't just nuke the site, just get rid of it, right?  I don't want a bunch of riffraff in my site portfolio. The mistake I made is that that city  is still growing, right? It's still like, there's only so much space in the Dallas, Fort Worth area.  And so it's going to eventually be within my parameters, right? And it might go from,  10 leads to 20 leads over the course of the next couple of years per month. And I should have kept  it, right? So I just let those sit because all that's going to happen is that domain is going to  age. It's going to get hit with some more backlinks. It's going to, and it'll be number one forever.  You can't beat that very easily. That's so hyper local that you're glued to the top at that point.  Glued, glued. So that's a good point. And I actually have a situation like that as well.  And just because I don't check it long enough, it was kind of pissing me off. It wasn't getting  enough leads. We got a deal, but it was very low. And then the city just started growing. It's a  city in Utah. And it's kind of like, over the past, this year, I'll give you an example,  looking at the data right now, this is a city of the population of 35,000. And it's averaged,  there isn't concrete. It's averaged 13.1 calls per month. This is through October 30th. And it's  averaged another 3.7 per month with the quote form. So I'm averaging close to 18 leads per month.  And I almost ripped the city. It's not making me a ton of money. It's making me like 600 bucks  a month. But dude, 500, 600 bucks a month, go find that on a real estate deal right now.  You know what I'm saying? Yeah. And where else is that business owner going to get leads?  Exactly. What other option do they have? If you're getting 18 leads a month in that area,  and you're number one, and you're running ads, and you're doing everything right,  what other options do they have at that point? You're locked in with that business owner.  100%. 100%. So here's the projects I looked at. I want to give you guys kind of a range.  I looked at, let me see. We got one, two, three, four. I looked at five different projects.  And when I did the training before version one and version two, I basically just took one project  because it was ranking really well. That was Bentonville Concrete. And I said, okay,  I know how many leads this is getting. It's ranking in the GMB. It's ranking in the maps.  And I want to compare that with what the tool says. Well, one thing that happened that I didn't  even think about is as we start to talk about Bentonville Concrete, the people in the group,  and",

    "pageContent": "maybe even in the free group, are searching Bentonville Concrete. So I think, I personally  think it had an effect and kind of skewed the numbers a little bit on that city. It drove the  cost up significantly on the cost per click and everything else. So I ended up looking at five  different projects. Of those, one, two, three of those are in concrete. One of them is in towing  and one of them is in duct cleaning. I kind of wanted to get a little bit of a mix.  We had a ranging population. One of them was a 35,000 population. All the way up to the highest  was a 95,000 population. So nothing that's too big, okay? But here's what I came up with. And  this is what Ryan and I, after discussing with his research, my research, is that we don't have  an exact, exact, exact, but we have a range. And what we mean by that is if you go into a city  that is very low-hanging fruit, very non-competitive, low CPC, not much competition,  that you can just tell the people that are in the, that are ranking for those keywords,  brand new websites, or they're not very old, they don't have much content, they don't have  much backlinks. It looks like just a bunch of hillbilly freaking people ranking against you.  In those situations, we can safely say 50 on it, again, using the rank and rent engine search tool,  due diligence tool. If it says 50, you're in good hands. That's on a low competition  area. If it's on a medium competition area where, okay, a couple of your competitors on,  you know, for your main keywords, they have a pretty good website. Maybe you're going up  against a rank and rent person that's a medium competition. You could still rank,  but it's going to be a bit more difficult. Maybe the CPC is tipping closer to five,  maybe even slightly over. You want to make sure you're at least 70, okay? And again,  this is on your main keyword, your main keyword. What was the other thing? Oh,  then the last thing I was going to say, and on those cities that are high competition,  you shouldn't be going into anyway, you freaking dummies. No, I'm just kidding.  But if it's high competition, you shouldn't be going into it. So if it's medium competition,  make sure it's 70. If it's low competition, 50 you can get away with. And that's good. I  feel pretty dang confident about saying that. Now, keep in mind, if you're running ads,  the ads during the winter, during certain times of the year, it's going to be up and down a bit.  But we know that if we can get the ads going, if we can get ranked organically,  and you know, in some cases, maybe grab a GMB if you get lucky, then you're going to be in  great shape. So anything you want to add to that, Ryan, I know that's like a bit anticlimactic. Maybe  you guys expect it to be something different, but again, this is not with any tool because we're not  before it was use any tool. We're specifically talking about rank and rent engine with this.  And that's why we wanted to wait to come out with this. So go ahead, Ryan.  Totally. I think Nick nailed it. I agree with this. This is my assessment as well.  These things change over time. This is why Nick's group, Digital Landlords, you know, why you're  staying on the cutting edge of the trade craft",

    "pageContent": "of this industry is really important because these  are not, it's not static. These are things to revisit and these things to look at. But there  are some things that are like timeless principles. One of them being that search volume is going to be  the largest like driver for success for what a market looks like. And so really paying attention  to what's succeeding and what isn't matters a lot. Those numbers are, I totally agree with those  numbers. The only little thing that I would add to that is that, and I think I saw a question kind  of getting to this in the chat, that the search volume for the primary keyword should include  variants of that keyword. So for example, concrete contractor, contractor near me, right? Those are  going to, if you have like 40 for one and 20 for the other, that's showing 60 between the two of  those. That's like, that's your primary keyword and a variant of it. That's going to get you the  results that you're looking for. Okay. I have a question for you. I'm curious your thoughts.  Let's say I go into rank and run engine. I'm doing concrete. I have concrete contractor,  concrete, concrete sidewalk, concrete driveway, concrete company, all the main keywords of our  keyword list. My main keyword has 50 and all my other keywords show zero. What are you going into  this? Low competition. If it's low competition, I'd try it and see what happens. It's generally  not a good sign if the core keyword list has zero as search volume, because I found that those are  likely often true. However, the caveat that I give on this is that if it shows zero for those and you  go into it and try it, there are examples I found where it has turned out awesome. So it's worth  trying is what I would say, especially with you guys that do the pre-selling method. It's worth  trying because what do you have to lose, right? A little bit of ad spend to know if it works or  it doesn't, and it's a place that others will overlook, right? Because they're saying like,  oh, this is too low, whatever. But these tools, even the very best like rank and run engine pulls  directly in from Google. Google Keyword Planner is the best, right? That is Google saying, here's what  we're seeing in our search ecosystem. And that is the standard, right? And so we're pulling in API  data from them. And so if Google is saying that, sometimes they don't always know perfectly. And  if Google doesn't know, these other tools sure don't know. So you might be able to find one where  you're going to be able to win and you're not going to have anyone that's going to come in and try to  catch you before you can close the business owner. So I've had that happen before as well. So it  doesn't deter me. That's another thing that I like. When I was using SEMrush before, it seemed  for whatever reason I would type in, let's say Bentonville concrete, it would show nothing. And  then I type in concrete Bentonville AR, and it would show 50. And it was so confusing. But the  way that I kind of went after it, I was always like, I was guessing a bit, but I was like, well,  if I see at least two keywords, two variations, and I have all these different variations I would  try, okay, then I'm good. Like with St. George, for example, St. George, people spell it S-T  George. Some people spell it S-A-I-N-T George. So I'd have to try all these variations. So anyway,",

    "pageContent": " it's just nice because I'm able to just go and look at all the keywords at once if I'm like,  okay, I want to try just a slight difference. Yeah, I can go change it all at once and run them  instantly. But I definitely agree, guys. That's the beautiful thing about doing the pre-song.  I was just going to say, Ryan, if I were to ask you, hey, with that same scenario, 50 search volume,  zero on the other keywords, would you go and build a website there by the domain, do the whole thing?  I bet you your answer would be no, because you're not 100% confident. But I'd be willing to try it  for 100 bucks, right? Throw 100 bucks ads out. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I don't think there's a wrong  answer there. Some people will put up sites just to put up a site and see what happens and then  let it sit. And then the worst case scenario is, is two years later, you've got a domain age  of two years that no one can touch you on if they try to come in there, at least on that,  on your domain age. But it makes way more sense if you're optimizing for speed and just trying  to see which one is going to land to, hey, throw something up there, run some ads to it. If it  doesn't work, move on. 100%. And I would argue, guys, if you are going into a niche like a concrete  and you find a city that's really low-hanging fruit and it's questionable, you know that this  example I'm giving you guys with the 35,000 population, it's slowly started to grow.  You know people need concrete. So even if you build it and there's not a ton of leads,  there's always a deal to be had. But because I believe in pre-selling, because I only sell  using the pre-selling method, I know that some of you guys have been frustrated in the past  because you go in, it looks good. It's low-hanging fruit. It's kind of on that teetering edge  of volume. You do the ads and then all of a sudden you start like, it goes like a week and  you don't see anything. So if you want to be very, very, very, very conservative,  I would say 70 and above, as long as it's medium competition or less, you're good to go. But again,  if it's low competition, I think you could go as low as 50 and be pretty safe. But again,  there's variables. It's hard to just give a black and white. If there's no volume for the  ancillary keywords, that could be a red flag. If there's just all kinds of different little  tiny factors that you need to consider. So a couple of questions I want to address really quick.  Gina says, I know a city near us in Georgia, but there is not a great search volume.  Do you still go into it? I think she's referring to probably a city that's growing.  She said there's not great search volume. I think in that case, just like what you just said,  you can kind of get an age domain going, kind of make a long-term play, but you're probably not  going to see a lot right out the gates, even if you run ads, if there's not much search volume.  What are your thoughts? Yeah. It depends on your perception of that city, I think. So I've got a  city in Tennessee that is really small on the search volume numbers, do not look good. But I  know that that city is growing. I know that there are people moving",

    "pageContent": "there, that people want to live  there, that it's got a upward trajectory that is unmatched by any other city really in Tennessee  right now. So I put one there and that site kills it. It's doing great. So Gina, I'd say like, look,  it depends on the way that you build your agency and your own personal approach to  your risk assessment, right? Are you willing to see what happens if you put a hundred bucks  of ads into it? Because it could mean that you find something that no one else is looking at  and no one else is going to find. And if you do, that's a win, right? In my agency, I tend to go  for those things. I tend to just say, hey, let's try it out. Let's see what happens and experiment.  A lot of this business model I've found is try it, right? Just see what happens. And if it works,  you've got a winner. And if it doesn't work, at least now you know, and you're not going to  just always be wondering about it. Right. I think that's solid advice. Richard says,  for the main keyword question mark, what about the long tail keyword? I think we addressed that,  right? Maybe he said that before we got into it, but we kind of addressed that, correct?  Yeah. Yeah. I think it's helpful to understand why would someone search for a long tail keyword?  In your own search habits, why would a person search habits? Why would they search for a  long tail keyword? And think about if I'm living in Memphis and I want a concrete contractor,  I'm just going to search concrete contractor, right? Because I don't need to search. Google  knows where I live. It's going to pull up local search. If someone searches the long tail keyword,  concrete contractor in Memphis, Tennessee, they probably do not live in the Memphis area. So  they're looking from outside. Who looks from outside of a city? General contractors, builders,  investors, people that are looking to do projects in the city, commercial, people looking for  commercial work that manage a commercial facility in the city. So I found that if the  long tail keyword has search volume, it probably is a high growth area because it means that people  from outside the city who have money, who want to invest in properties in that city by doing some  kind of project related to that keyword are searching for it, right? That's kind of the  psychology behind long tail keywords that I found has been indicative of a growth area.  Okay, let's keep moving along. And guys, if you have any questions related to the search volume  topic before we get into more of the software side. By the way, I didn't even mention this  at the beginning, which is bad, but we're going to be, again, I said this at the beginning,  we appreciate everyone that did the beta stuff. We're like one month, our original deal, we gave  everybody two months of free beta, right? Was that what it was? Or two months of 20% off.  And anyway, we just appreciate that feedback. And I know we've implemented, you've implemented  quite a few of the changes already, haven't you, Ryan? Yeah. Yeah. So thanks to everyone that did  beta. Some of these are here. So Richard particularly has been super helpful. He submitted  a bunch of tickets. You guys, this is made by the people that do this business model. This isn't  made by some corporation that's sitting in Silicon Valley. This is made by people that are doing  rank and rent, people that are industry leaders in this area that have built agencies that are  successful, what works, what",

If you're a user and you're like,  hey, be cool if it did this, be cool if it did this. We have a feature request that you could  put in and that goes straight to my inbox. And I look at those and I'm like, you know what?  That'd be great. Let's do that. And then I just task out the developers and they go and they create  it, right? We add it to the product roadmap. So over the course of beta, we found edge cases  and things like that that were important for you guys to have it in the platform.  And we made those updates. And so it's been really, really useful. And part of the,  there was a discount for the first two months for people that were the early signups for beta.  And we really appreciate you guys. Yeah. Quick question, just a clarification, Ryan.  The people that did do beta, if they want to, are they able to tap into an extended  discount based on what we set up or do we have to, or is it just, is it done?  Yeah. If they've already made an account and they took advantage of the beta pricing,  that was for early access for the folks in the beta. And so they've got that.  We'll have deals and things like that in the future. They'll get access to things that come  out later on just as a gesture of saying, thank you. But they got locked into that early pricing  from the job. Also for you guys that are in this, we're going to make sure that we take care of you  guys above everybody. So just keep that in mind. And again, we just want to say we appreciate the  feedback. Okay. Bo says, okay, this one I'm going to read the question. You can give your feedback.  I'm going to give my feedback and I'm going to tell you what my answer is. But he says,  can you touch on CPC on Rare? Before I read the whole question, I'm going to let you know this,  Bo, is that I have a pretty solid answer because of course we're looking at this. There's another  question that's related to the backlinks. There's a couple different components of due diligence.  We're just making sure that we're dialed in. On the CPC, I'm at the same place I was a few weeks  ago with the search volume, which is I'm in, this campaign's performing well. How does it look  inside of RankinRen Engine? Okay. Now I can confidently say this is what it should be. So  I don't have a solid answer. Do this every time. Is it the average of this for you just yet? But I  just will answer by saying that's what I'm working on now. Now that we have the search volume piece,  now we're working on what the CPC should be according to Rare, as well as the backlinks  as well. So I don't know, Ryan, do you have anything else you want to add on that?  Yeah. I'd say that you're trying to get on the high top of page to get the most leads,  but it's not the end of the world if you don't. This goes back into like, this is a little bit  squishy, right? You're going to have to try it out. You're going to have to see what works for you.  And then see what kind of results that you're actually getting. So if I see a high top of page  bid that is like 20 bucks, I'm not going to even",

    "pageContent": "fool with it, right? But if I see one that's $10  and then the low top of page bid is $1 and it's averaging at five, I'm totally comfortable with  that, right? Because what I'll do is also run ads that are a little bit off hours as well. So starting  at 7.30 in the morning through, I don't know, 7 p.m. at night where others are not running ads,  I'm going to take advantage of that high top of page bid when others are not running ads. Maybe  there's end at 5 p.m. and mine runs until 7 p.m. I'm going to get cheaper ad clicks in that two  hour delta between those times. So there's strategies and tactics that you can deploy to  take advantage of the less expensive clicks. But I don't worry about the high top of page bid if I  think that on an average across my keywords that I'm going to do okay for my campaign forecasting.  Beautiful. So yeah, Bo, stay tuned. We'll have more details on that. I would rather let you know,  say that to you than give you some random answer. I have to come back and correct. So anyway,  so guys, that's search volume, okay? 50 on the low end, low competition, 50, medium competition,  70. If you want to be extra safe, do 70 and above. To be honest, if it's your first project,  maybe make sure it's 70 and above. But at the end of the day, guys, make sure that we're following  the exact recipe, right? I've given you the recipe of how to bake the perfect cake.  Can you deviate from it and still have success? Yeah, some of you guys have probably done that on  accident and still have success. And then you get in your head, oh my gosh, this is untrue, but  that's an anomaly. And we've done this a lot of times. I've lost a lot of money. I've made the  mistakes. So the closer you can get to the advice that we're giving you, it's because we've tried  it, we've tested it, and that is what we've seen to work. Can it still work if you deviate slightly?  Yes. But every time you deviate, you're running the risk of messing up that recipe that actually  works. All right. That is, I think, all the questions that we had so far on search volume.  We've nailed that. I know you guys have been waiting on that. If anyone has any clarifications,  keep going. Other than that, Ryan, why don't we open back the tool? I know last time,  I'm going to give you co-host, I know last time we literally only got to talk about  due diligence. We got to talk about the Explorer website, kind of do the metrics on that.  We didn't get a ton into the project stuff, the list of projects, the CRM, that kind of stuff. So  let me give you co-host real quick, sir. Let me see why this doesn't work. Hold on.  All right. Beautiful. Okay, done.  Cool. Fire it up. Where do you want to go with it? Where do you want to take this train today?  I just want you to give them a bit more. Last time when we talked, I always get hung up talking  and talking and talking about the due diligence, because to me, that's the easiest way that I could  just see how valuable this is, because that's how much time it took me to do due diligence  when I was coming up and doing them literally on sheets of paper.

I don't think we had a ton of people on the last time we did it. We  didn't promote it super hard because we were just doing a beta anyway. I think we could also talk  about the Keyword Planner, but let's just get into this. Guys, for those that have no idea what  that we're talking about, this is Rank and Run Engine. This is something that Ryan's been working  on for 15 months. It's the version 2.0 of what he's used to scale his agency. It's our go-to  standard tool that we are going to be using exclusively because it's getting data directly  from Google and because we can control it and we can give Ryan feedback and a host of different  reasons. It's super affordable. It's less than the price of a tool of it, like SEMrush, et cetera.  But that is what this is, and we're just going to be talking about that a bit today. For those of  you that did not get the beta code, you can message me and I have a code that you guys can use as a  launch code that you guys can access as well. If you were not part of the beta and you're  interested, message me. I'll send you a code. We can go from there. Ryan, let's go into some  of these different features, some of these different benefits that this tool has.  For sure. Let's talk about Bo's question. Bo asked about the difference between the low  top of page bid and the high top of page bid. This is Keyword Planner. We're going to do the  keyword masonry and we're doing it in Knoxville. You guys that are building your agencies need to,  one of the most important things you can understand about this keyword tool is some of them are going  to have local cities that are smaller. Some of them have DMA regions, which are much larger.  You can go into bigger markets sometimes if you know that your search volume is good and your cost  per click is really low. This is an example. Brick related things in the Knoxville area.  I'm not saying that this meets the population requirements. I'm not saying that it's low  hanging fruit. I'm just using this as an example to answer Bo's question. I had this pulled up.  He was asking about the difference with low top of page bid and high top of page bid.  Google's saying, hey, it's $1.43 per click for the low and $3.92 for the high. That's awesome.  That's a great keyword. Some of these, though, guys are more expensive. I'm going to do masonry  and masonry contractor near me. You can see that the difference between four bucks and $33 almost  is pretty significant. There's other keywords in here that are going to be gold mines. Let me just  do bricks, veneers. This goes to Gene's question a little bit about building a good keyword list.  Look at this. 140 search volume and less than $2. Just because an industry has those really,  really high dollar amounts doesn't mean that it's not viable. You can find these keywords  that people look for brick veneers. That's a really high ticket service. You get to re-brick  a whole house with brick veneers and it's going to be really expensive. You can get that click  for less than two bucks. Until you and I talk, I didn't even know what that was.  If somebody's searching brick veneers, they are buying the service.",

Brick veneers is a specialty brick service that  it's not a DIY thing, man. You're not doing DIY brick veneers usually unless you're  Bob Villa, right? It's just not happening. Another is tuck pointing.  Hold on. Is brick veneering just like doing veneers on your teeth? Do they whittle your  teeth down so you look like a gremlin and then they put the caps on?  Yeah. Yeah. They do that to your house. That's crazy, dude.  They put brick veneers on the outside of the house to give that timeless brick look. It's  really popular. You can see just on the search volume here how popular this is.  That's another money keyword that ... There's these variations here, right? Brick paneling.  People that search this don't know to call it brick veneers, but they know what it is.  Thin brick, brick veneers. You can see that even though if you do masonry contractor and you're  mean, it's 30 bucks a click. The people that are looking for brick veneers are looking brick  paneling and these other brick-related overlay type keywords. They're looking for a masonry  contractor. You don't have to get totally hung up on, oh, it's $30. This isn't going to work.  This is just another way to search for that primary keyword.  I have a question, Ryan. Let's say that we were looking that up. Let's say we're in masonry.  We find out masonry is 30 bucks a click top, the high end. You're like, okay, I could go and target  terms like this on my ads. On your SEO side, would you still be targeting the term masonry  as your H1 on your page title, that kind of thing, or would you change that strategy at all?  100%. This is still going to be masonry near me. They're looking for a brick masonry contractor.  That's the expensive one. It's $18. It's a cost per click average. This is still what I'm targeting.  This is still my primary keyword. It's still going to my H1. It's still going to my landing page,  but if I run ads to it, it is probably not going to make the mix.  The reason I wanted to bring that up, guys, is that the thing that's interesting is when you see  high CPC, it's terrible for ads, but nothing's better than when you have organic  leads coming in for those high CPC terms. That usually means that they're very highly sought  after. The good strategy is get your clicks for the low cost terms, start ranking for the high  cost terms, and between the two, you have a freaking smasher of a website. It also looks  like the freaking hooptie of websites, the Geo Metro of websites while you're at it.  Yeah, absolutely. That's a great strategy. You're able to take advantage of these other  keywords that are overlooked. Let's see. Did I misspell that? Tuck, oink, ding.  Okay. Spelling is hard when I'm doing it live. All right. This one is another good example of  a keyword that between tuck pointing and tuck pointing near me and some of these others,  there might be 40 or 50 searches a month, but it's going to be super cheap clicks.  That's not a DIY thing. Someone's paying a mason to come out and do that. Be mindful of,  just because",

They're just  not using the specialist primary keyword that has that high cost per click.  Gina had a really interesting suggestion. I don't know if you want to wrap up this thought,  or if you're done, but maybe you could show ... You don't have to show a full,  but maybe we could pick a niche and you could show us how you go about building a keyword list  using rank and run engine, coming up with ideas, seeing what's highly searched,  that kind of thing. I don't know if that's something you could show us.  Yeah, dude. Let's do it live. What do you got? Give me a niche. What do you want to do?  Let's stay away from the regulars, but let's keep it still. Let's ask Gina. Gina, what do you got?  Give us something that's not concrete, tree service, spray foam insulation, and we'll do it.  If it is one of those, then let's keep going. I love those niches. I still make money in those  niches. We're still closing deals in those niches, but I guess I'm just a little tired of talking  about concrete, personally. It's only because I've been doing it for three years. I'm still  going to do it. I just am tired of talking about it. I love some demo.  Yeah, exactly. If you're watching this car right now, demo, I've got some demo clients and they do  not bat an eye at $1,500 a month. They don't think twice about it because the demo jobs,  entry-level demo jobs are high ticket, but they'll get jobs that are like,  I had a demo job come in for one of my clients that was a quarter million dollars.  Crazy. Yeah. Let's do some demo. Let's do demo.  Just to answer Gina's question really quick, she says, are we not using the Google Trends?  No, guys. We want to see how Ryan's using this to build his keyword list. Remember, we're redoing  the training 3.0. In the meantime, you can still follow everything the exact same. The training is  still how I build my keyword list. You got to remember, this tool just came out three,  four weeks ago. I'm still taking my strategy using how I used to and then how am I going to  use it here, looking at what Ryan's doing. But no, for anybody that's confused, just keep following  the training. It still works as how I've continually made thousands and thousands of dollars, but we  want to see how Ryan's using Rare because we want to utilize and just beat the heck out of this tool  as much as possible if we're going to have it. Let's do demolition and let's build a keyword  list. But anyone else that's confused, keep doing what you're doing. This is just to see how Ryan's  doing. This could also be a good way to generate additional ideas if you're hung up trying to find  and build that keyword list. Let's see how you do it, man. Yeah, 100%. Guys, we're showing you a  part of the keyword analysis process, Nick, and the training starts with Google Trends.  You can look at the national, are we in the right ballpark for the cities we're looking at?  That's very similar to talking about the chat GPT approach, looking nationally at what our  search volume is. We're a little bit further along in that part, and we've got some areas  that we're looking at",

    "pageContent": "now. This is not removing that part of the training. That's still essential,  but we're just zoomed in a little bit here. Let's say that we see demolition is trending  in Tennessee, and demolition is interesting, guys, because there's only so much real estate  in a city, and there's only so much good real estate in a city. If there's old properties that  are in a blight district or there's an area that is growing, but there's old properties there that  people are buying up, they have to demolish those old properties to build new ones. It's required.  There's only got so much space. Demolition is a really, really good one to go into. I'm a big fan  of demolition. Demolition, let's do Tennessee. Let's just see what happens with some Knoxville.  Just already in here, so let's just search it and see what happens.  You guys can see 260 searches, probably three bucks a click.  3F357 for demolition. Let's see what happens. That's more expensive. Demolition companies near me,  though, is a good one. That's six bucks. What I'll do is I'll go through demolition-related  keywords, demolition, demolition contractor, demolition company, demolition services,  and I'll start looking at what these look like. As I build up my keyword list, I'm going to have  my core, my primary keyword is going to be demolition or demolition contractor,  and then I'm going to start adding these in as part of my core keyword list. It's also going  to depend on what my vision is for this actual site. Do I want other services related demolition,  because demolition guys will often also do excavation and trenching. It just depends on  how you want to eventually build out the site. If you're wanting to just specialize in just straight  up demolition, there's a lot of good keywords here that when you add all these up, there's  probably another 100 or plus or more searches per month in this market just for demolition.  Let's do another city. Let's do some nationals growing. These are bigger areas, but you can see  that there's a lot of opportunity in these areas. Six bucks a click, six bucks a click,  demolition companies near me. I will go and I'll build up my keyword list by looking at the primary  keyword, making sure that it's got solid search volume standards that Nick and I talked about a  second ago. Then I'll add in all these additional ones as part of my secondary keyword list where  these are not primary, but they're variants of the primary. When you add all these up,  you're going to get calls where other people are not optimizing for these keywords, and you're  going to get the call for house demolition companies near me or pool removal contractors,  because the guys that do demolition will also do some of these specialty services  related to demolition. You can add these in commercial demolition contractors. That is a  great keyword, and people are probably not looking for it. Build these out right into a sheet,  and just add these in, or I'll go straight to my due diligence tab and I'll make a due diligence  record where I'll add in these keywords that I see coming up over and over with good search volume.  Yeah, what's up, Nick? I know a couple of different ideas that I would find this,  but for somebody that may be asking, let's say that Gina thinks of a brand new service. She's  like, I'm going to go into excavation or demolition. How do you go about finding out what's the main  keyword? Do you just go off of what it's called and use your intuition and say, well, if it's ",

    "pageContent": "excavation, it's probably excavation. Let me look at the difference between excavation and  excavation contractor, excavation company. How do you determine that main keyword? I'm curious  how you do it. I'll let you guys know how I would do it and how I would find it really quickly.  Yeah, I would love to hear Nick's answer to this. I think this requires just a little bit of  speculation, but making just sort of informed guesses. For example, there's a difference  as in industries. If I just type in concrete, that is not going to give me the results that I want.  If I just do straight up concrete, if we just use a tried and true example, there's 1900 searches,  but that's not what I want because people are going to use that to find ready mix and delivery  by the yard or whatever. But if I do demolition, and I know this because I've had campaigns that  run ads and I've seen my organic clicks, demolition is likely going to, you can't buy just a demolition  product. You know what I'm saying? It's not a product and a service. It's an action. It's a  service. You're doing demolition. Now, what do they mean by that? Do they mean interior  remodeling demo? That's very different than destroying a structure, removing it away,  and then clearing the land. That's going to be more likely to be a demolition contractor.  But in this case, that keyword or demolition company is a good one. In that case, I will look  at the keyword and I will make a judgment about, okay, this is not a product. Concrete is the  product, but it's also a keyword that is going to be used in concrete contractor. I want to make  an assessment about whether this is going to be likely someone calling for someone to do this  specialty service. In this case, demolition would be one that I would add. A demolition contractor  very often would add that to. Concrete would not add that. Concrete contractor would be a great  one. It varies by industry. I just really make a judgment call about really what the search volume  looks like and how I would search for it, frankly. What would you do, Nick?  I would be lazy and just tick-tapping other people's work. I'd go to some major cities,  type in what I think it is, type in demolition. I'd look at the top three results in the organic,  and I would look at the page title because those guys most likely are paying SEO companies. Make  sure it's big cities, competitive cities, Atlanta, L.A., whatever. I guarantee the page title, the  thing that shows up in the SERPs, the first word or the first two words is going to be demolition  service, demolition service. That would be an interesting one to look at right there, demolition  contractor. I would look at three, four cities and then I would come up with two, three ideas.  Then I would go pump it into RankinRent engine and I would see which one. Again, this is just when  you go into a new niche. This is why it's so important to stay in the same niche because  concrete, me and you, we can just go off the top of our head and know our keyword list.  I'm curious to see what demolition service is.  It's going to pull up 10, but let's do a bigger...  So it's going to pull up these related keywords and there's...  And that's just to generate ideas. I would go in and do that in like three, four cities and I'd  look, okay, I keep seeing demolition service, I keep seeing demolition contractor and then I would  just look at that inside of this tool and",

Full service demolition. Is that a Legion?  I don't know, man.  It almost looks like it, but then it's, I mean, it's kind of got a brand. They did a good job  with it is. So again, these are just some ideas, but once again, this is the reason why you guys,  if you go and you take the time to learn a niche, you don't have to keep... There you go.  That's a Legion site.  Yeah, we've built that for one of my students.  Oh, there you go.  This is a lead generator in Atlanta and you can see that he's made it in, right? So look how...  Then that's a good looking site. Go up again, it's best demolition service.  Oh, you're looking at the...  The headline, yeah, right there. Demolition contractor, sorry. Yeah, that's another good  thing. If you could find a lead generator, it doesn't necessarily mean they know what  they're doing, but usually they know what they're doing more than everybody else. And if they're  ranking, they probably know what they're doing. So these are just ideas. You could also ask in  the group if you want. That's another idea, you know? But these are just when you're going  into a new niche. And I just wanted to bring that up because she asked to build a keyword  list from scratch. So again, guys, you could stick with how we do it until I'm continuing  to do it, but I might, based on this, now that we're using rank and run engine, the version 3.0  might have a slightly different way that we do it if it's faster, if it's more accurate, et cetera.  So that's why I was curious to see your process.  Totally, man. Yeah, it's great being on this call with you guys. Looking at the  the fundamentals and constantly revisiting the fundamentals. I think that there's a lot  of entrepreneurs that are very, very successful that I listen to that talk about, you know,  revisiting your business model from first principles over and over and over and over again,  right? Because there's people that are not doing that. They're getting left in the dust because  the world changes, search changes, search volume changes. And I love that Digital Landlords is  always thinking about like, how do we make sure that we're going to consistently get results for  students? It's cool talking about this with you guys today.  Gina, just to clarify Gina's question before we end this, she said, I'm just a little thrown off  by her searching for it, I guess. Do you always search for Tennessee or do you choose a large  city? I think it kind of goes back to the whole concept of like, people are people are people.  The thinking with the Google Trends is that you can kind of cast a wider net.  And so I think for now, I still like the, let me ask this, can you search on rank and  rent without putting in a city and just go globally or nationwide? Or do you have to put  in a city? It's made for local search. Okay. So maybe what you could do, Gina,  to start to start to get ideas is just use trends to find those main terms and then come  into rank and rent in the city you're looking at and then start going from there.  Yeah. Yeah. I think, again, let's talk about earlier, like we were",

And then we zoom in the next part and we look at, you know, at the city level, right? The state  city level and see like, okay, what is it actually? We know what the trend is and saying, hey, here's  the trend, but what is in reality, right? Because we got to make a decision about whether it's a  Bible market based on the very specific data as we have it for that area. Yeah.  Yeah. Anyway, beautiful. Well, Jahil just joined and then Corey helped him out. He said 50th low  competition. If you want to be very conservative, Jahil 70 is the very bottom of the list if you  want to be very conservative. But, you know, this is what we found right now. As we roll out version  3.0, I'm going to keep testing. I'm going to keep looking at this. Now I can go into rank and rent  engine, refresh it and see if anything changed right before I release it and see if those numbers  are any different. But as of right now, standing November 5th, 2024, 50 with a low competition  and 70 with a medium competition. And that is that. So I also want to just mention one more thing.  I do appreciate, I see those of you that post your wins and share your success and everything,  I know it takes time. But I know, I don't know about you, Ryan, but when I was in these groups,  like just learning the ropes, dude, I would feed off of these posts. When I saw people, even if  they just got their first lead in, they just got their first website up, they just, you know,  sometimes hearing about somebody's like failure even gave me encouragement. Like, hey, I just  cold called this business owner. I got kicked in the teeth and whatever. So anyway, I just want  to let you guys know, I really appreciate you guys sharing those wins in this group and the free group  and that it's complete social proof. It helps us a ton. And just to want you guys know that I  noticed that. So anything else you want to add, Ryan? Thanks for having me on, man. I am always  happy to be with you guys and Digital Landlords. I love this group and I agree with what Nick said.  You know, I think that I have my failures. I have, you know, to get to $87,000 a month was a bumpy  road. I screwed up so many things, made so many mistakes, got told no so many times, lost Bo's.  This is part of what we do, right? Like you're going to have success look like this, you know,  and it's fun to watch people getting closes and wins and things like that. But behind every one  of those, there's no's and there's, you know, people that are, you know, laser focused and  don't give up and then they post their wins. So it's fun to be on this journey with you guys. And  I'm glad to be on the call today. Well, Ryan, appreciate you, bro. And guys, again, for those  of you that did not get the beta discount, if you guys want to give RankinRant Engine a try with,  again, just for, just so everybody knows, you do not have to use this tool.

But what I'm telling you is from experience,  it's better to just start and build a proper foundation and scale it up than throw together  a duct tape business and try to retroactively fix it. That is very, very difficult. It's so  much easier if you build it from the ground up, you have your projects lined out, you have your  tasks lined out, you have your freaking due diligence. It's all in one place. You log in,  boom, boom, boom. You have one tool you need, done. But again, I don't want anyone to feel like they  have to. But if you guys are interested, message me.

Thanks for having me on. Go close and flash. Go get some deals. It's  only freaking Tuesday. We got time, man. It's Tuesday morning for you guys. We got time to go  sling some freaking deals this week, man. By the way, let me mention one more thing.  Today's Election Day, everyone's kind of been weird because it's like, I don't know what's going  to happen. Well, hopefully after today, maybe by Saturday. I know I was reading earlier, like  the George Bush Al Gore one took a couple weeks. But it seems like after this, whatever happens,  people at least have some clarity. And I feel like that things start to become a little bit normal,  at least until the holidays. And then it gets a little weird. But I know that the economy's weird,  people are uncertain. So I'm super optimistic because no matter what, people are always anxious.  After today, tomorrow, this week, we should start seeing things normalize a little bit. So  I'm kind of looking forward to that. A hundred percent. A hundred percent.  Okay guys, talk soon. Appreciate it, Ryan. Thanks for having me on, man. See you.",

Maybe I'm speaking to you that have been in this group for a minute.  You understand the model.  You might even have started building your first project, or maybe you've even landed  your first client, but you haven't really seen how passive this can become.  It's really important, Kurt Thomas, welcome from Cleveland, Ohio, welcome to The Call.  It's very easy for people to toss around the term passive, passive income, passive income,  passive income.  First and foremost, everyone's old enough and mature enough, and hopefully has enough  experience to realize there's really no such thing as 100% passivity, okay?  There's varying degrees of passivity, but there's not passive or non-passive.  It's just degrees, okay?  Even regular real estate is not completely passive.  You got to evict people sometimes.  You got to fix this.  You got to fix that.  You got to raise prices, re-sign contracts.  It's never 100% pass, okay?  Nothing is, and I'm not going to lie to you guys, for those of you that are new, for those  of you that are exploring this model, or for those of you that have gotten into it but  haven't quite gotten that website ranked, I'm not going to lie and say it's completely  passive because nothing is completely passive, okay?  So we're going to start there.  Also, what I would like to do is give away a little bit of swag.  Let me see if I can show everybody, let me see if I can show everybody what we got, okay?  First and foremost, some of the stuff that we have, we have the t-shirts, we have the  mouse pads, we have the AirPod cases, we have the coffee mugs, we have the stickers.  We got a few little knickknacks, whatever, that can sit on your desk.  We got some hoodies, some hats.  So we're going to be giving away some swag today.  So I appreciate you guys being active on the call.  I'm going to be choosing a few winners and give away some stuff, okay?  So just stick with me.  There's Nick Bass, Nick Bassaraba from Canada as well, and we're going to be talking about  a bunch of stuff today, but I'm going to also be doing that, okay?  So for those of you that maybe are new to this group, Kurt, some of you guys have heard  my story, some of you haven't.  I'm not going to share it again, but if you watch any of my content, you'll hear the story.  Been doing this eight years.  I've made by renting, by building and renting simple websites, have made well over a million  dollars for the past four years, with the exception of 2020 and 2021.  Those years, we made a million in 2020, just over.  We did 1.45, 1.5 in 2021, but it's been well over that since, and we will never go back.  But I want you guys to know that we made this money, we're making this money doing the model  that we're teaching in this program, which is building and renting simple websites.  And that's what you need to know about me.  That's what you should be asking yourself is why the heck should I listen to this guy  who's just another, you know, somebody full of crap, whatever, you know, it's",

And my, I have, I have a Lamborghini Huracan parked in my garage.  By the way, I waited until I could pay completely just cash for this thing, or else I wasn't  going to do it.  And this, I bought this thing.  It'd be a year on October 31st, like it's been almost a year guys in 2020.  I've driven it three times.  Okay.  One of those times was about five weeks ago, my son was going to school.  There's only two seats.  You can't even take all the kids, but he's like, yeah, let's take the car, drop me off  in the Lamborghini.  I'm like, okay, cool.  Pull up, drop him off.  His friends are going crazy, whatever.  And I was talking about their school and he goes, yeah, my buddies, my buddies, they asked  me if you rent, if you were renting the Lamborghini.  And I just, I laugh and he didn't even know that was a thing, which is good.  But he's, he told, I said, what'd you say?  He's like, yeah, I just told him, I don't think that's even an option.  The point that I'm making guys is there's so much fake stuff out there that even people  that are even these 10, 11, 12 year old kids, they see a sports car and they just assume  the person's fake.  They assume that they're renting the Lamborghini.  They assume that they're full of crap.  And so you can look at that as a bad thing or a good thing.  I look at it as, as who cares?  I want you guys to be distrusting because if you trust me and just take my word for  it, you're going to trust everybody after me.  So I want you to listen to what I'm saying.  When you get to be in business for a little while, you can tell if somebody's full of  crap or if they've actually been there and done that.  And I want you to like, does, does your gut tell you like, does you feel, does it feel  natural?  Does it feel like I'm making it up?  And if you don't feel like what I'm saying is true, I don't, I don't want you to be on  these calls.  I don't, I don't want you to have to pretend or to fake or whatever.  I want you to question everything and every group you are online and every person that  you hear.  And so I wanted to start by letting you know, I've made millions and millions of dollars  doing the business model of building simple websites and renting them out for passive  income.  That's why I'm here talking to you guys.  Okay.  Not because I think I'm smart.  Not because of this, that or whatever, it's because I've actually done it and I'm continuing  to do it.  Okay.  So what I want to do, my goal by the end of this call, we're going to do like, I'd say  about 20 to 25 minutes.  I'm going to talk about this passivity.  How passive is this model?  And then we're going to go into some Q&A stuff.  Also throughout this call, if you guys have Q&A that's relevant, I want to answer it as  we go.  I know we're not on a",

Okay.  But again, my goal for this, this episode or it's not really an episode, but this, this  call today is that I want you guys by the end to know exactly how passive this model  is and then you can base your decisions off of that.  Okay.  No BS, no fluff, et cetera.  Okay.  So here's some of the stuff that we're going to cover, guys.  We're going to be talking about how nothing's truly passive.  Just a tiny bit more.  I've already talked about that.  We're going to talk about where most of the work with this business model comes.  Then we're going to be talking about the most important step of the process.  Then we're going to be talking about different clients and how each client is not created  equally.  Then I'm going to show you guys and talk to you about some of my most passive websites.  Then I'm going to talk to you about why I believe this is the most passive, what, sorry,  why I believe this is such a passive model, why it's, why it can be that passive.  And then I'm going to give you guys a little bit of bonus at the end and we're going to  wrap this up and do some Q&A.  Okay.  So I want to get into it really, really quick, but as usual, I completely forgot to turn  my AC off or on, so give me one second.  It's still like a hundred and freaking something here.  Give me one sec.  Hold on.  All right, guys, let's talk about passive, the passivity of this business model.  Okay.  As I already mentioned, nothing is completely passive.  And by the way, I actually want to ask this question.  If anybody on this call right now, there's 10 of you guys on, if anybody knows of a model  that is completely 100% passive, I would love for you guys to let me know in the comments.  Okay.  Because to my knowledge, there is nothing that is passive, 100%.  Okay.  Does anyone know of any, any business model out there?  TikTok shop, from TikTok shop to whatever, does anyone know of a business model that  is completely passive?  Matthew Torres, welcome to the call.  I'm going to wait.  Does anybody know of a business model that is completely passive?  John, John Galenvo, I think.  Sean Sean is also in.  Kurt says just failure.  Yeah, that's passive.  Luke Pritchard, what's on, or what's going on, man?  Luke Pritchard was our winner of our recent scholarship.  Shout out to Luke in Australia.  So guys, as I'm continuing, if you guys can think of anything that's 100% passive, please  let me know.  But to my knowledge, there's no such thing.  Okay.  As I mentioned before, there's, there's nothing that's completely passive.  There's varying degrees of passivity.  And on the one hand, there's something, there's things that are not passive at all.  On the other hand, there's things that are very passive.  And we're going to talk about where on the scale this business model actually ends up.  Okay.  For those of you that have never done this, what you need to understand about this business  model is that all of the work of this business model is front loaded and",

    "pageContent": "it is very, very  front loaded.  Okay.  It's not like you do a certain amount here and then you do a certain amount in the middle  and then a little bit at the end.  It is almost entirely front loaded and it seems like a lot in the beginning.  But if you can get to the point where you can get the client, get the website ranking,  get the ads turned down a bit, you can create something that is pretty darn passive.  Jason Allred says nothing is passive.  I don't think so either, but if somebody can correct me, that'd be great.  Okay.  Guys.  The reason why this is such a front loaded business is because, I'm going to say this,  the biggest thing which we're going to, I don't want to jump ahead too much, but the  biggest thing that you got to start with is you got to pick the right city and you got  to pick the right industry.  If you don't pick the right city and the right industry, you're dead in the water.  Okay.  I know some of you guys have been in this long enough.  You're like, yeah, we already know this, but I don't know if you actually understand how  important this is.  What happens is when you first get into this model, you're so anxious to get your first  website up.  You're so anxious to just get going, which I respect and I love, but you go and you go  into the wrong city, you go into the wrong niche and then you're like, I can't get my  website to rank or my website's ranking, it's not producing leads or my website's ranking,  it's producing leads, but I can't find a hungry business owner.  Any one of those options does not equal money.  So guys, you have to know how to do due diligence.  You have to know how to pick a city and how to pick a niche.  Some of you guys think that just because you research something and the CPC is below $5,  which for those of you who have no idea what I'm talking about, I'm coming, just chill,  that you're just going to go into it.  That's not the case, guys.  It took me from 2016 to 2020, mid-2020, before I felt like I had a process for picking a  city and a niche, that was bulletproof and the only reason I was able to develop it is  because I went into so many of the wrong cities and so many of the wrong niches.  I went into 50 different cities in the wrong niche, okay, 50.  I don't know how many times I've been into a city and a niche that looked good and I've  come to find out it's not good, okay.  I've made the mistakes, I've done all those things and that's how I know what the model  is.  So you got to, you know, it's front-loaded because you got to pick the city, you got  to pick the niche, you got to make sure that's perfect.  Then you got to also, you know, let's say you got to land the client.  The way that I teach it is I go, I get a client first, I get the contract, I get the credit  contract, you got to get the client.  Then once you get the client, you got to build a website and after you build the website,  you got to do the SEO and the content and da-da-da-da-da and then you got to do the  backlinks, you got to get this ranked, you got to keep the client happy.  But guys, once you get to the point where you've",

    "pageContent": "built the website, you got the deal,  okay, and these are not in any specific order because you guys know that I get the client  first and then I get the website.  But once you get to the point where you do those things, you have a website, you have  a client and the client has been with you that initial six months, okay?  What I do at that point is I roll them into another contract.  So they're with me six months and then I'm like, hey, does this sound like, is it going  good because for me it looks good, I would like to continue with you, are you going to  continue with me?  Yes, okay, sounds good.  Here's what we're going to do.  We're going to extend this out a year and I'm going to lock in your rate for you.  And guys, I'm telling you that if you can just get business owners, keep them happy,  get them to that six month mark and get them into a second contract, even if it's six months,  but I try to get them into a year contract right away.  So then I'm always on yearly contracts, right?  Once you get past that initial contract, if you can get them to sign into another one  and you've done your homework, you've done your SEO, you've done your website, this is  where the business model becomes fun.  This is where the business model becomes very, very passive and this is where everything  opens up and you can start to really scale, okay?  But I'm here to tell you that all the work is going to come in that first six months  and inside of that first six months, 90% of that work is going to come inside the first  month, because that's when you're going to be landing the client, when you're going to  be doing the due diligence, when you're going to be sending the leads, when you're going  to be setting up the website.  And then once you get the website, you start doing the content, then you're just slowly  dripping out backlinks or updating this, that, adding a photo, doing a blog, whatever, and  it's not that much.  So in the first six months is all of the work.  All of the work is in the first six months.  Inside of those six months, inside the first month, maybe even say 45 days to be safe,  inside the first 45 days of the first six months is where all the work comes and it  slowly begins to get lighter and lighter and easier and easier, okay?  So you guys need to understand that this business model is frontloaded, okay?  Now Scott Gray asked the golden question.  He said, how do you pick the city and niche?  Very carefully, my friend, very carefully.  I'm going to give you guys a couple of criteria, but again, guys, that is, there's no way  I could answer that on this call.  Even if we had an hour call dedicated to that question, then there's no way I could even  touch it.  It is something that is an exact process.  That's something that we teach inside Digital Landlords, however, you don't have to be inside  Digital Landlords.  You can go develop your own due diligence.  You can go develop your own system for picking a city and a niche, but it's going to require  you to be willing to fail on a lot of projects, be willing to not rank on a lot of projects.  So a couple of things, though, guys, on the niche.  I'm a big believer, you guys have heard me say this before, go into the boring, tried  and true niches until you get till",

    "pageContent": "your bills are paid.  If your bills are 10K a month, you probably need to make about $15,000, $16,000 gross  to net that because you're going to have some ad spend in there if you're going to pre-sell.  So until you get to like $15,000, $16,000 per month gross, I wouldn't even worry about  changing niches.  I would stay in the basic niches, the concrete, the spray foam, the masonry, artificial grass,  the fencing, the, you know, duct cleaning, the gutter installation, the basic tried and  true niches first.  Okay, that's what I'd say in terms of the niches.  Picking a city, I'll give you a couple of tips.  Number one, population does not matter, search volume does, growing areas, if you know that  it's a growing area because you've lived there, you have family there, you have some kind  of intel, maybe you're a lumber salesman and you like know that the top performing reps  are in Bentonville, Arkansas and you're like, oh, that's weird, it must be a huge boom.  That's interesting, you're going to be, there's a lot of population, so that means that most  of the time for these basic services, there's going to be an increase in demand, right,  because the area is growing.  Another thing on city is typically the lower the population, the lower the competition,  but that's not always the case.  What else can I say in terms of city?  I would definitely highly, highly, highly and strongly recommend that whatever city  you go into, that the average cost per click is less than $5 and if that doesn't mean anything  to you, it doesn't make any sense at all, you haven't watched enough content, but it  will, those are some of my criteria, but everyone wants to talk about population and this, that,  the rest, oh, the other thing I would mention, try not to go in cities and states that are  super seasonal, okay?  I try to stay out of North Dakota, I try to stay out of Minnesota, I try to stay out of  stuff that's so extreme, Chicago, it's very hot, it's very cold and it's swinging and  all of a sudden you've got these contractors that don't want to work and all this stuff,  that's just some of the things I would recommend without giving you all the secret sauce, okay?  There you go.  Scott, does that answer your question?  Okay, we've got another question.  Munib Kashif says one question, if there's no ads running in your niche and also there  are businesses ranked organically, is it a flag not to get in there, especially if you're  beginning?  If there's ads in your niche and there's also businesses ranked organically, there's always  going to be businesses ranked organically, dog, somebody's got to be ranked organically,  so that's not a red flag for me, if I see businesses ranked organically, then that's  just part of Google, somebody has to rank at the top of Google, you know, even if it's  crappy competition, they're still taking your traffic, so I don't worry as much about that  and also if people are running ads, no, that doesn't scare me at all.  If people are running ads, you know what that means?  That means that they've got some hungry business owners that I'm going to go sell to, I'm going  to go sell my service to these hungry business owners, so absolutely not, is that a red flag  in my opinion, okay?

    "pageContent": "question.  If anyone has any more questions, keep dropping the questions, these are good questions, they're  relevant questions, I appreciate them, okay?  Next thing I want to talk about really, really quick, guys, is just to reiterate a little  bit more, is if you pick the right city and you pick the right niche, once you are ranked,  this business requires very little work, it's kind of like climbing a mountain, okay?  And what I mean by that, if you guys have ever climbed a mountain, it's like this huge  steep ascension and you get, you're climbing, you're grabbing branches, you're falling down,  you're getting dirty, whatever, whatever, you just claw your way to the top and it's  a real pain, and then once you get to the top, to stay at the top is very easy, right?  A lot of times these hills, they're flat at the top, whatever, once you get to the top,  to stay at the top, it's easy, it's very, very easy, right?  It's the climb that's so hard, and so you guys need to understand that even though you've  got all this front-load of work, you've got six months of hard work and probably 45 days  of really hard work in the very beginning, guys, once you get to the top of this mountain,  once you get to that six-month mark, websites ranking, clients in the year two or the second  contract, this business model becomes very, very passive, okay?  And I've got plenty of different examples for you guys that I can share, but I just  want you guys to understand that you've got to remember that picking that right city in  that right niche is so vital because it changes the entire freaking game, and if you don't  pick the right city in the right niche, from experience, everything becomes harder, okay?  Now let's talk really quick.  I want to let you guys know that not all clients are created equally, okay?  Not all clients, and the truth is that once you get to the top of Google, you're pretty  well going to stay ranked at the top of Google.  Unless somebody comes in, it's like a really popular city, it's a big city, and you attract  some big competition, most likely you're not going to get overtaken, and even if you do,  you're going to get bumped down one spot, you do a little bit of SEO, you're back up,  okay?  It's not going to be that difficult once you get ranked to stay at the top.  However, okay, however, business owners are a different story, yeah?  Business owners are a different story.  You could be at the top of Google, you could be producing the most amount of leads, and  you could have the most high-maintenance business owner on the planet, and that is going to  make this one of the most least passive business models on the planet because of your business  owner, okay?  I've had some of the best business owners that I don't talk to ever, that I literally  talk to once every two years, once every three years, and I'm checking on them to see how  their wife did when they went to surgery.  You could also have the business owner that literally thinks that they can text you every  single day and ask you where the leads are if things are slow for one day.  So you guys need to understand, you hear a lot of these older veterans that are in my  program that have been here a while, and they always talk about picking the right business  owner, picking the right business owner.  And a lot of you guys that are brand new, you're so desperate for",

    "pageContent": "money, you're going  to go get the first business owner that offers you money, even if they suck, and it's going  to come and bite you in the butt, okay?  And it's going to bite you in the butt because you're going to be dealing with that person  when you could have been dealing with someone that's way less maintenance for the exact  same price, okay?  Also just so you guys know, you've probably seen these memes, you've probably seen these  things or you might have heard of it, maybe you don't believe it, maybe you do, but I  promise you guys the cheaper, the cheapest clients that you have that are paying you  the least amount of money are always the hardest ones to deal with.  I don't know why it is, I don't know what it is, but that is the truth.  The business owners that are the hardest to deal with are the business owners that pay  the least.  And I don't know why that correlation is, but I think it's because that small amount  of money means everything to them.  And when you deal with the big companies, when you deal with the successful companies,  they don't care because they're willing to test the file, okay?  So just understand that not all clients are created equally and the degree of passivity  your website is going to have is going to largely depend on the client that you're working  with, okay?  Because that client, if you set expectations from the beginning and the client's low maintenance,  the client's chill, you just have to worry about ranking your website.  Once you rank the website, you're going to be glued to the top for the most part.  And if you have a website glued to the top and a very low maintenance client, you have  a freaking, just a gold, a piece of gold sitting in your lap, okay?  It's the best thing ever.  You have a low maintenance client and you have a website that's ranking.  It's the best business model in the world.  If you have a high maintenance client, oh man, or you didn't do your due diligence properly  and you're just doing SEO backlinks, blah, blah, blah, blah, guys, those become very,  very, very challenging.  Okay.  We have a couple of questions here.  Scott says, how about competition in the search results?  Which lead gen in the top 10, do you try another?  That's such a good question.  I've answered this question a few times.  No, I do not run away if that's what you're asking.  If I see another lead generator in the top 10.  And guys, first and foremost, if you guys are looking at competition, which you better  be looking at competition, because if you don't look at who's ranking for the terms  you want to rank for, you have no idea who you're going against.  If you have no idea who you're going against, you don't know how well you need to prepare,  how dialed in you need to be.  So my first tip for you guys is if you're looking at competition, make sure that you're  using five to seven keywords.  Okay.  Don't just go and type in.  Let me see where somebody was living, hold on.  Let's see.  By the way, Luke just asked a question.  He's about to hop out of the car.  Luke, go ahead and ask that question inside the digital landlords so that we can answer  it there since you're going to hop off because I got two more questions that are coming before  you.  Okay.  So ask that.  Great to have you on the stream.  And looks",

It's 75 degrees upstairs here in my office and it's October.  Now, granted, I know it's hot outside, but my goodness, the AC just doesn't want to crank.  Maybe we should use my house as a lead.  Too bad that's not my favorite niche.  Okay.  Okay.  Hold on one sec.  Let's see what we got here.  So going back to Scott.  So what I was about to say, guys, is that you need to make sure you're using multiple keywords.  Imagine if I used somebody said they were in Cleveland, Ohio, Kurt Thomas.  Then I go into Cleveland and I type in tree service, Cleveland, Ohio, and I look at it  and it looks super competitive, right?  Because it is.  And everyone there is pretty, you know, these websites are juicy websites, lots of content,  old websites, older domains.  You know, I've got a good backlink profile, good, well-written content.  And I look at the term tree service, Cleveland, Ohio or concrete, what'd I say?  Tree.  I can't remember.  We'll use tree service.  And it looks super competitive.  And I'm like, yeah, I'm out.  Dude, this looks way competitive.  However, what if I went in and I looked at instead of one term, I looked at seven terms  and that term tree service was the most, there was very, very competitive, but tree removal,  tree company, tree cutting, tree service company, tree company near me, tree service company  near me, on and on, tree, tree lopping, whatever, if you're in Australia, all of those terms  are wide open.  There's not much competition, right?  That would mean that I've missed out on a huge opportunity.  On the flip side, I've done this before as I go and I look at one term, I look at foundation  repair Savannah, Georgia.  And dude, that term right there looks amazing.  It looks like it's wide open.  It looks like I can go in, I can rank it.  And I'm like, dude, this is a great opportunity.  The CPC on that one term is good.  I go in and I decide to build a project.  I decide to start running ads, but I forgot to look at the other six keywords, the other  five keywords, and I don't even realize it.  And I get in and I'm getting my butt handed to me because I didn't look at all the keywords.  So the answer, the short answer to your question, Scott, is no, I do not care if I see another  lead generator in there.  All I do is I view that as another competition, as another business owner that's stealing  my leads.  And I got to get in there and steal them back.  That's it.  Okay.  Whether it's a lead generator, whether it's home advisor, whether it's the local concrete  tree service guy, they are stealing your spots.  They are taking your leads and they are competition.  But I'm not going to treat a lead generator as any different of competition than just  Joe down the street.  I just need to look at his website.  If his website is very juicy, very highly ranked, high domain authority, high, really  good backlink profile, I might not go into that.  But if it's garbage, then I'm going to pretend I don't even know",

    "pageContent": "that's a lead generation  website and I'm going to go into it anyway.  Okay.  Good comments.  Lars Shepard says, do you have any red flags you look for when you first talk to a B.O.?  Yes.  Number one red flag is they're rude to their clients.  Okay.  This is why I like to live transfer my first few leads, guys.  By the way, we're going to be talking about some of my most passive websites here in just  a second.  Then we're going to get into Q&A.  But if I hear them talking poorly to their clients, don't have good customer service,  you know what I can automatically assume  is that they're not going to retain clients.  And they're probably not gonna close deals.  And if they don't close deals and they don't make money  and they don't retain clients,  they're not gonna be with me very long.  They're not gonna have money.  It's not gonna be an ROI.  Even if my leads are good, there's gonna be no ROI  and I'm going to lose that client.  So if I hear you talking to a client poorly,  if I hear you being rude or short  or non-personal with a client,  I already can tell you  that even though they're willing to give me money,  I'm not gonna take it.  Because I'm looking to build relationships  with business owners that want to be with me  for 10, 15, 20 years and make millions of dollars together.  I'm not looking to get a client today,  three months later, switch it out for somebody else.  So if I hear them talking poorly,  that's a huge red flag for me.  Let's see, I'm in the car on the way to work  so I need to balance my interest to know  once you have finally ranked organically,  are you still drip feeding the sites  with backlinks to content or is it okay?  So he's asking guys, once you rank the site organically,  do you keep dripping on backlinks, keep adding content?  And the answer is you can.  What I've done is I've done such strong due diligence  on most of my websites that I do not even worry about it.  I don't even log into my website.  It's kind of like, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.  We have websites, we don't even,  I mean, we could find the password,  but we don't know the password.  It's not even part of our regular account.  We've got Towing St. George, my last towing project.  I'm never gonna do it again.  We don't touch it.  We've got Bentonville Concrete.  No way I'm touching that.  We've got a handful, 10, 15 sites  that are ranking super well,  and there's absolutely no reason for us to go in  and mess with it because we're already ranking.  So that's the approach that I've chosen to take,  but it's up to you guys.  Okay?  Kurt says good stuff.  So guys, here's what I'm gonna do.  Let me see if I can pull up a couple of websites.  Let me see if I can pull up a couple of websites  for you guys.  Here, show you some of my most passive websites.  And we're gonna do, which ones did I wanna do?  We got that one.  All right.  One more, one more.  Let's see which last one we're gonna do.  There it is.  I'm gonna show you guys my screen here, by the way. ",

Let me show you a couple of my most passive websites  on the interwebs today,  and I should tell you guys exactly how passive they are.  Okay, share my screen.  Boom, boom, boom.  Okay, I don't know if you guys can actually see this,  but I'm gonna start off with Bentonville Concrete.  If you guys have heard me talk about this,  kick it out of my face.  So this is us right here, Bentonville Concrete.  We're in the maps.  This is also us, rank number one.  You can also type in Concrete Contractor Bentonville AR.  Rank number two here, rank number one here, okay?  This is my website.  Guys, I'm going to let you know,  the last time I messaged this person  was on about business,  because once in a while we'll talk about random stuff.  Like he just randomly sent me something a couple weeks ago  about some completely random thing.  But the last time he asked about business, guys,  was on November 10th,  Friday, November 10th of last year.  He said, hey brother,  I've sent a bunch of emails back and forth.  I'd like to get together and talk and figure out  how I can really expand this business.  I know you guys are good at what you do.  And so are we, I want your help.  Let's figure out how we can do this together.  So the only reason this guy even texts me  is because he was asking me for more business, okay?  This is one of my most passive websites.  It's glued to the top.  We haven't logged into this thing in years.  Haven't changed it in years.  I haven't talked to my business owner since November.  There you have it.  And even then I never even got on a call with him, not yet.  Okay, that's my first one.  My second one is one called St. George Epoxy.  If you type in St. George Epoxy, Epoxy St. George,  it's all called stgeorgeepoxy.com.  Check out this beaut.  This guy right here is an absolute,  just pile of you know what, super basic whatever,  but it works.  And I'm gonna look up the business owner  so I can show you guys, or tell you guys at least.  The last time I got a text from him,  I have three unread messages from him.  March 15th, two messages on March 15th,  and a message on March 16th.  The last thing he said is,  we still need to do your pool deck, LOL, okay?  Homie's still trying to scrape my business, no problem.  Come and give me a quote on it.  I don't really mind, okay?  This website right here,  we also have not logged into in years.  We talked to the business owner.  What did I say the date was?  July, it's been over a year.  That's 2023, it's been a year.  July, August, September, been a year and two months.  Haven't talked to the client, okay?  Let's give you guys one more.  We'll do St. George Concrete, type this in.  You're gonna see us, we are running ads.  She's sponsored here, us.  We're ranked number one underneath the map,  or",

So look at this, guys, okay?  We got, this should give you guys  so much freaking excitement.  So we got ConcreteStGeorge.com,  which has been there for a long time, okay?  They're actually outranking me.  I'm StGeorgeConcreteCO.com, okay?  That site looked a little too nice for it to be mine, okay?  This is my site in all of its glory, it's a beaut.  And this website makes me $375 per week.  This client, let me just go ahead and check.  What the hell is his name?  Oh, this is gonna be a problem.  Is it, shit.  What is his, ah, yes, I just remembered it.  That's what it is.  Yep, okay, November 18th, 2022.  I got one text from November 18th, 2022.  These guys have spent with me.  Let me look.  What the hell?  Okay, not that, not that, not that, not that.  Okay, not that, not that, not that, right there.  Ah, no, that's, is that it?  No, that's not it, dude.  Okay, oh, right there, there it is.  Okay, this client pays me $375 a week,  has paid me, to date,  five, five, oh, sorry, $57,000 on the nose.  Okay, been with me since November 3rd, 2021,  the website you're looking at.  Not ranked number one, not ranking in the maps,  don't even think I have a maps listing.  This thing is churning out leads, $375 a week.  Unfrickin' believable.  This is some of my most passive websites,  and I just grabbed those ones for fun, okay?  Just to give you guys a bit of an idea,  and guys, here's why I think this model is so passive.  I think this model's really passive  because it's such a binary transaction.  I give you leads, you give me money.  You give me money, I give you leads.  If you stop giving me leads, I stop giving you money.  If I stop giving you money, you stop giving me leads.  Done, done, done.  There's no reporting, there's no this,  can you do this stuff, yes?  Do you have to, no.  Okay, no other business model I know  that's such a cut and dry transaction  that's you do this, and I do this,  or else we're done because the arrangement,  there's no room for fluff, right?  When you're doing SEO,  you could do almost nothing for the client.  It took you no time.  Or you could go hire somebody in the Philippines  to do backlinks, do 100 backlinks,  and you come to the business owner and go,  dude, look, I did 100 backlinks for your website,  and by the way, blah, blah, blah,  it doesn't even make sense,  but you're able to show them and craft it  to make it look like you want it to look.  The downside is, with this business model,  you can't fake it, man, and I think that's an upside,  but you can't fake it.  You can't fake work you didn't do  because if",

It's leads for dollars, okay?  And then lastly, guys, I just wanna let you guys know  that just because you don't have to talk to your clients,  just because you don't have to call them every five minutes,  because you don't have to send them a report,  I want you to picture a business that you have  that you actually do that,  that you actually treat them like they're your last client.  You treat them like they're all of their money  pays all of your bills and then some  because they're that big of a client  and they're all you have to worry about.  Imagine what your business would be like.  Imagine how excited they would be.  Imagine how they would grow with you.  Imagine how many people they would refer you to.  If you just made the decision,  hey, I'm not required to really follow up with this person  or treat them a certain way,  but I'm gonna do it because that's how I do business.  Imagine how many referrals you'd have  be coming down the freaking pipe, a lot, okay?  A lot.  Guys, this model is one of if not the most passive models  on the internet, no questions asked.  And this is the reason I'm able to travel to Dubai  for a month at a time, two times.  We've been in Africa for three months,  been to London twice,  been to a couple of different places in the US,  including Tuscaloosa, Georgia, Alabama game,  getting ready to potentially go to Arkansas  in a week and a half.  Or if not, I might go back to Africa  during that same time.  All of this is possible because this model is passive  and there's different levels.  Okay, just because you have an online business, that's great.  But if that online business is not passive,  you could travel anywhere you want,  but you're gonna be stuck at the hotel  making sure that business is as usual  or you can't keep living that way.  With this, you can do it, you front load all the work  and then you set it and you forget it, okay?  So guys, that is what I truly believe.  This is how passive these things are.  I will tell you that that website I showed you,  Bentonville Concrete, I don't think we're running any ads.  We have a 20 something dollar a year GoDaddy bill.  Cool, we're paying for a tracking number five bucks  and the domain, sorry, the hosting and the domain.  I think that the domain is the thing that's 24 bucks  and then we have the hosting that's like 13 bucks a month.  So guys, all in on less than $50 per month on a website  that's making me about 900 bucks a month.  That's the case for all of these websites.  That's how low cost these things can actually be, okay?  So that said guys, let's see if we have any questions.  If we do, great.  If we don't, then we will go back to making money.  Let me just pull this up really quick.  Give me a sec, where you at?  Dog, oh, he's just hiding from me.  Okay.  Ah, where is this at?  And by the way guys,  I really appreciate you guys being on the call.  I know you guys got a lot of places you can be.  I know there's a lot of things",

Okay, so let's see what else we've got going on.  Oh, all right, let's go like this.  How important is it to occupy more real estate  multiple websites on the first page  for our keywords to hold a monopoly?  I don't have any websites  that have more than one piece of real estate.  I've had websites in the past that I ranked the homepage,  I ranked the service page, we had like two,  plus we had the maps.  But guys, most of my deals  are ranking a website organically.  I don't mess with GMB at all really anymore.  I have some paid ads coming in,  I got some organic coming in,  I keep the client happy with that.  Okay.  Kirk says, how important is GMB and how do you acquire it?  No, it's not, I don't do it anymore.  Guys, in 2020, when I scaled up to $100,000  a month in eight months,  half of my websites didn't even have GMB.  We think that they have to have GMB  because we think somehow the clients know about GMB.  The clients don't know shit, dude.  I'm sorry for the language, but they don't know anything.  So don't think that just because you don't have a GMB,  you're not gonna be able to charge $1,500 a month.  Okay, that concrete website I showed you guys,  let me see if I can even try to find, hold on.  Let me see if I can share the screen really quick.  All right, let's see if we can even find,  I don't even think we have a map listing, dude.  This is $1,500 a month deal  that's paid me over $57,000 so far.  And I'm telling you right now,  we do not have a St. George concrete site.  I think we did, I think it got pulled.  So to answer your question,  I don't worry about it at all, okay?  Laura says, do you feel like Flat Fever's commission  is really important to make this pass?  Yes.  No questions asked.  I can't even imagine doing passive income for one deal,  or sorry, passive.  Commission deals for one deal,  much less a bunch of deals.  That sounds like a nightmare.  That sounds like I'd rather pull out my teeth,  pull out my toenails,  do something like that,  rather than put a rat on top of my head  with a woven basket and let it eat down in my skull,  than doing commission, guys.  Commission does not scale.  They have nothing in the game.  They have no reason to go to these leads.  They have no reason to be better than average.  And most of these guys are very, very average or less, okay?  You have to do flat fee if you want to scale.  If you don't want to scale,  you just want a couple bucks coming in here and there.  You can go to everybody to say yes to a commission deal,  but just know upfront that commission deals don't work.  They don't work long-term.  They don't scale and it is very, very cumbersome.  So that said, if you don't want to believe me,  then go try it.  Kurt says, RIP GMB.  Yeah, RIP GMB, RIP GMB, but you know what?  It is what it is, man.  We're",

    "pageContent": " Okay. So guys, welcome to the call. It is October 22nd, 2024. We're almost a month into  Q4, which is going to put us at like, you know, we have like two to less than two and  a half months, like 10 weeks left in the year, probably less than 10 weeks left in the year.  And it's just crazy how these years are flying by these months are flying by. But anyway,  I just saw the date really quick. Couple things real, real quick. Number one, I hope you guys  are having as much fun and as excited about this new RankinRent engine tool as I am. I'm  not in there every single day. I don't want to lie to you, but I am doing this multiple  times a week. I'm, you know, blocking out time where I can go in. I can run due diligence.  I can, you know, we've added all of our projects in there. We're testing the search volume  tool. We're looking at our, what's it called? Our project management side. And we're doing  everything inside of RankinRent engine. So if you guys have no idea what I'm talking  about, you probably were not on the live that we ran a couple of weeks ago with Ryan Dalton.  And basically in short, we now have an official tool that we can say definitively, this is  the tool that we're going to use. This is the standard. This is the metrics we're going  to go off of. This is going to be when we say, here's how much it needs to be in search  volume. It's going to go off of this tool. And that is exciting because up until now,  it's kind of been like, hey, use whatever you want. And you have to kind of figure out  the numbers on your own, which is good and bad. But I'm excited because I've never been  able to like endorse any tool or say this is the one because I didn't have control over  it. Right. And so, you know, we've used SEMrush. We've used Mangools. We've used, we've talked  about keyword planner. We've talked about, what else? There's a bunch of different ones  that we've talked about with Ahrefs, like all kinds of different stuff. But now we have  one RankinRentEngine.com and we are in the middle of a four to five week beta test. It  is a paid beta test and we've gotten some really, really good feedback. We know it's  not perfect. We weren't expecting it to be perfect. And that's why we asked you guys  to help us. And so I know for me and my team, we're in there between all of us. We're in  there every single day and we've already done a bunch of, we've given a bunch of feedback  to Ryan who he's taking to the developers and we're making those adjustments. And yeah.  So anyway, if you guys don't know what I'm talking about, you missed that, go to RankinRentEngine.com  what I would actually encourage you to do. And I'm saying this because I had somebody  message me, it was this morning or yesterday that said, hey, so do you recommend that I  use SEMrush? And I said, no, that's not the case at all. I recommend that you use RankinRentEngine.  And so I want to drop this live that we did. Let me see if I can find it really quick.  Hold on. Tool Ryan Dalton. Check out this live that I did with Ryan Dalton. And from  this, hold on. Okay. Pause that. From this guys, you can",

I'll drop that in as well. Here we go.  I think it's Ignition24 and it's like a 20% off discount for the first couple of months.  But I am stoked about the tool. Just because it does all the stuff that I was, I had like  all kinds of tools. I had Google Sheets. We had Pipe Drive. We had a custom tool that  our software guy built for us. We were using, at one point using Asana. We were also using,  there's another one. I can't even remember what it's called. I mean, we had like five,  six, seven different tools that we were checking out, trying with Google Drive, this, that,  the rest. Now we have one place. We have our team members. We can assign tasks. We can  keep track. We can see what we need to do. And it's pretty dang cool. You can see your projects.  It saves all your due diligence. If nothing else, the thing that I love the most, guys,  is that it's saving me a ton of time on the due diligence. So anyway, guys,  if you don't know what I'm talking about, then check out that live. Use that code if you're  interested. If not, we're going to be doing an official launch the first or second week  of November, but it is going to be full price. So if you're interested, I would check that out  as soon as possible. Okay. Last two things, guys, really, really quick. I made this post  inside of the art of digital real estate, our free group. And I did that because I didn't want  to confuse anyone. I wanted to wait and explain this to you guys. But guys, if you do not already,  hold on one second. Let me get rid of these stupid notifications. If you do not already,  hold on, hold on. Give me one second.  Okay. If you guys have not already seen that post, me and Francesca and our agency are in the process  of really trying to scale. And we are looking for people who have websites, projects that are  ranking, that are producing leads, but that do not have clients yet. Maybe you guys have built them  and you've tried to get a client. You haven't been able to. They're getting leads, whatever the case  is. And you want to turn those into cash because you now, first and foremost, if you, I encourage  you to keep your assets, right? Because an asset is something that's going to pay you again and  again and again. And if all you need is a renter, I want you to keep trying to get them in. I don't  want you guys to do this, to hook me up. I'm talking about those of you that may have a  website that you've tried to sell it. You can't sell it, whatever the case is, or maybe you need  some quick cash. I want you to message Francesca, let her know. Now this needs to be a website that  is consistently producing leads that does not have a business owner. Okay. It's ranking and  producing leads, not with ads, because guys, I can go set up my own. We have our own projects  running with ads. I'm talking about projects that are already ranking that do not have clients that  you want to potentially turn into cash. And by the way, we are going to make an offer to you. If we  look at it, it looks good. We'll",

But I don't want your website as a client because I can go find a client, right? That's what  I do. It's not that difficult. But if you are somebody that has a project that is ranking,  has leads coming in, then message Francesca if you're interested in possibly offloading that.  Okay. Last thing I want to mention, guys, is we are in the process of outlining version 3.0 of our  training. So this will be the third time that we've actually shot the training. We're outlining  right now, looking to shoot it and finalize it in quarter one of next year. So don't get too,  I don't want everyone to ask me every five seconds when it's going to be done.  Where there's a few things that we're testing, there's a few things that we're making sure,  like for example, we are actually trying a new strategy, a new kind of wrinkle to our ads set up  and our ads process, which we are now in the week, probably six of testing. And we're probably going  to be doing it for three, three, four more weeks. That's going to be something that we include in  version 3.0. I'm bringing this up because if you guys have things, feedback, suggestions,  please DM me and fix it Felix on a group message and let us know. But we like, I'm not going to  sit here and pretend like it's perfect. I know it's not perfect. There's things that have changed.  There's things that I'm doing differently that I wasn't doing. We understand that there's a  few things that may be a little bit confusing that we didn't realize. So rather than making like  a post that says, oh, I don't understand this, this and this, just message us and we're going  to add that to the outline. It is okay if you guys ask questions, but we would just appreciate  the feedback and just know that we're working on it. We hear your feedback. We're excited to make  the version 3.0 and there's also going to be a 4.0 and a 5.0 and probably a 10.0 because we're  never going to be done with this business because I'm in this business just like you guys are in  this business. Okay. That said guys, let's go into the call today. Let's talk about taxes. Let's  talk about how to save money. Let's talk about how to keep as much money as possible that we're  actually making. So I want to give you a little context. My buddy, Cale Goodman is going to be  joining me here in about two minutes. Cale is a guy I met back in 2016. Ironically, I met Cale  right when I started my agency, right when I started doing my own ranking, right? And this  is at the point where I was just trying to get clients and I didn't understand what industries  to go into, what a good city looked like, what a good niche looked like. And I was literally in  the process of reaching out to all my buddies. Hey, do you know anybody that owns a business?  Do you know anybody that owns a business? And I got introduced to Cale Goodman. We went and actually  had sushi with another buddy of mine and he owns this amazing company called Easier Accounting.  Now, I didn't realize at the time this probably wasn't the best industry to generate leads doing  the method that we use, the",

I went to the office and I sat in front of him and three of his, sorry, two partners, so three  total people across from me. And I pitched them on this idea of doing rank and rent,  building a website, ranking it and sending them leads. And when I walked out of that meeting,  I walked out with a thousand dollar check and he shook my hand and he put his faith in me,  said, go get me some leads. Now, I didn't do a flat fee deal. I did like a paper lead, whatever.  And to be very honest, I got him a few leads and I knew it wasn't going to work. He knew  it wasn't going to work. He was cool about it. He gave me a chance and I didn't know that that  wasn't the greatest. Now, funny enough, I actually generated leads. I had a website called like  reddesertaccounting.com, something like that. And leads actually came in. The issue was they  weren't the type of leads that he was looking for because he has a very specific type of person  he wants to work with and that he does the best with. And so it wasn't the best use of  the rank and rent model. However, that's the first thing. A couple of years later, that was 2016,  2017 guys, or sorry, end of 2016. Many of you guys know I went and tried to start a software company.  I thought I was too cool for school. I thought I was too cool for the rank and rent model. I  went and tried to start a software company, which I failed miserably at. After that was done,  end of 2017, July, end of July, I started getting into SEO. I needed to pay the bills. I needed to  pay the bills. I was trying to get money coming in and I needed SEO money because I needed as  much as possible. I needed to keep, you know, those high margin deals. Well, a few months after,  maybe six months after I got really heavy into that SEO, you know, aspect pitching deals and  everything, I had a guy that I was partnering with on this SEO stuff. And I said to him, I said,  hey, I know these guys, let's go meet with them. It's going to be tough. You know, the SEO in this  space is difficult. And there we were, what is a year and a half later, sitting at the same table,  this time pitching an SEO deal. And I will be, I'm happy to tell you guys, I walked out of that deal  with a $4,000 per month retainer doing their SEO. And we did that for about six months, I believe.  And then this guy, Cale called me and he's like, dude, I'm doing the math here. I'm thinking I'm  just hiring somebody because I'm paying you guys like 4,000 bucks a month. So he's like, I just  want to let you know, you guys have been great. Said, no problem, man. I totally get it. Obviously,  it killed me to hear that, but I was like, whatever. And funny enough, he ended up taking my  partner. My partner called me. He's like, dude, I need something that's very, that's like more stable.  He's like, I think I'm going to apply for this job. So they ended up basically pulling him out  of my hand and hiring him for that",

I'm excited  for you guys to actually get to know him, get some tips, get some tips and tricks, some strategies  from him. And I want to say one thing. What I've learned about accounting is this can either make  you or break you. I was sitting with a guy that's worth over a hundred million dollars and he said  to me repeatedly, he said, it's not about what you make. It's about what you can keep. The second  thing my dad always, something my dad always used to tell me is he said, there's two things that you  do not want to be cheap about. And this is somebody taught him this. It's your attorney  and it's your accountant because you never want to scrimp on that. And so guys, from the day that I  started making money on my own, I've been paying professionals. I've never tried to do attorney  work on my own. I've always paid someone to start a set up my businesses, whatever. And I've always  paid an accountant to keep my books. I've spent, you know, heaven knows how much money on it, but  I know I've made five, 10 X what I've spent. So I'm excited. I'm going to be Kaelin right now.  And guys, the very last thing I'll say, if I heard somebody say this a few years back and it really  resonated with me, if you want to make professional money, you need to treat this business professionally.  The reason some of you guys are making side hustle money is because you're treating this  like a side hustle. The reason I make professional money doing this is because I treat this  professionally. I don't mess around with this. This is my business. This is my baby. I don't,  I'm not freaking doing this for my mom's basement. And even if I was, I'm treating this as if I'm  sitting at a skyscraper in a corner office. If you want to make professional money,  treat this professionally. And this is a way that you can do that. So let me bring Kaelin  really quick and we will get right into this call. One second. Let me see where he's at.  Hold on. There we go.  All right. Let's see if these guys can hear me. Kael, let me know if you can hear me, bro.  Got double Kael. I think it's Kason coming on with him.  Hold on. One sec. Oh, there he is. What's up, bro?  Dude, we're trying out something new today. We got the, like, the vibe board up over here  so we can share some stuff with you guys over there. We got super cool stuff for everybody  today and we're excited to be here. Amazing. Kason, what's up, bro? How are you?  I'm good, dude. Are you guys trying to join from another link as well? It says something's  connecting the audio. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, okay. Cool. I'll grab it. Yeah. No, no, no. You're good. You're  good. I just want to make sure there wasn't somebody else. So, Kael, what's up, bro? How  you doing? I'm doing great, man. Thanks for having me on today. For sure, man. I'm stoked  about this. I was just kind of giving a little preface introduction and told everyone that when  I first started doing this business, I came in and I was pitching you and I think it was JD  and",

That was cool. By the way, you just muted yourself on accident. Hold on.  Yeah, just unmute yourself. Okay. There you go. I can hear you now. You're good. You're good.  Okay. Oh, you have that one. Okay. So yeah, just me, one of them. And let me know. You can hear me,  right? No, we're good. We can hear you just fine. Do you hear an echo? Yeah, I'm here to echo.  You're good. You're good. Take care of it. And then we'll go through. So guys, real quick,  while they're getting that stuff set up, I want you guys, if you have questions related to taxes  and accounting related to this business, you guys can start dropping them in the comments.  We'll hit those at the end. Kael, you still got me? Oh, shit. I can't hear you now, bro.  Dude. There we go. I could see myself twice. I can see myself on the, but I can't hear an  echo anymore. So I think we're good there. Beautiful. Can you hear me? Yeah, we're good,  but no echo. So we're good. Sweet, dude. So yeah, that's dope, dude. So let's start off by just  doing like an intro, how the hell you got here into this space. Then I know you guys got some  stuff you want to share. I've also got some things that are interesting for me to kind of just throw  out there, but yeah, let's just kind of, let's start rolling. All of it, man. So to give you a  little background. Well, first of all, uh, me and Nick, you know, we, we talked for, I don't know,  dude months at the gym. That's where I first met you is at the gym. And then you were kind of like,  dude, I want to come in and show you some stuff. Right. And then he built a kind of a competing  company that did generate us leads. What wasn't it? It was just a competing company on our,  on a Google. Anyway, the whole thing worked is all I was going to say. And so it's kind of cool  to see years later, how you spun this up. You're teaching other people how to do it. You're getting  people results. And I really like it because it's a business model where people can get out and they  can make money. Anybody's got a little hustle to them and anyone's got like, you know, some,  some charisma about them. Like they can get out and find these deals all day long with people,  you know? And so, um, so I really like it because you can instantly be what they call open for  business, which is a tax term. I want to talk about with these guys today as well, which is huge to  open up a ton of tax savings, no matter what happens with business. And so, um, so that's kind  of a really cool thing that I like about your business model as well as like, literally you  can get people instantly open for business by IRS terms to help them really keep a ton of money in  the building phases. And so, uh, but, uh, but to give a little background, dude, so I, um, I,  so I actually came from a household growing up where all we did was fight about money in our  house, right? My",

    "pageContent": "parents were like constantly battling because my dad was a self-employed  blue collar contractor, he did siding, rain gutters, you know, solve a patient. He's just a,  just a contractor guy, but he was an independent guy. He had a crew, um, and he never understood  the money side of business and he never wanted to prioritize it. Um, so all I heard about my entire  household, my whole, my whole upbringing was, you know, this fight about the IRS, right? And so my  mom, uh, and dad were constantly fighting about money. And eventually after years and years and  years of them always fighting about this IRS, I didn't know what it was. I'm just a kid, right?  But as I got older, I started understanding more. And then the IRS finally, after a while, they  came in and started taking things, right? So, um, they, they literally came in and leaned my dad's  house. Um, they levy did his bank account. So I remember I helped him finish a job up in Salt Lake  City. Um, just as a young kid, I think I was like 13 or something working on a big apartment complex  up there with him. He was so excited to come put this big check in the bank, pay all his guys,  pay some money to the IRS because they'd been on his back before the second he put that money in  the bank account before he could use any of it. Boom, levy took it all out. He's like some $40,000  check, you know? And so now they're levy his bank accounts. They're leaning his home. My mom goes  and gets a job as a grocery, you know, a checker at Albertsons here in town. And they end up  garnishing your paychecks after like a month or two of working there. And so now, now they just  really squoze my parents to where like literally my dad had to just work for cash under the table,  you know? So in my mind, I was like, why would anybody want to be a business owner? I don't  ever want to do that. Like, heck no. And so, um, but I always wanted to make money. I always want  to have a great, great life. I always wanted to have financial abundance. And so, you know,  and I was just a hustler at heart. And so, uh, one of the best things that ever happened to me  is I ended up getting recruited as a sales guy by a guy that owned a tax and accounting firm to come  and do business development and sales with his entire, uh, accounting company. And so I got  really good at that. I became his top guy. I really, because of my upbringing, really threw  myself into it. And so I spent more time with the CPAs than I did the other sales guys, constantly  just trying to learn as much as I possibly could, because I finally understood like, wow, the IRS  didn't take everything from us. My dad just didn't understand it. He didn't want to put the  effort into getting the knowledge and creating the systems and the habits around the money side of  business, the tax side of business in order to really become successful. And so that gave me the  courage to start my own business. And then it gave me the courage to start my own accounting firm  and partner with some really great CPAs. And so here we are over 15 years later, and we've got  an awesome accounting firm. We got multiple CPAs and EAs and accountants with masters  that are in here serving our clients. And so our whole thing is like, Hey, we want to serve  business owners the way they need to be served,",

    "pageContent": "right? Cause anybody can do it. My dad did where  they went down, they just had a CPA and they brought them all their stuff every year and they  guessed. And then they, and then they, the accountants really just doing what the business  owner brings them. And then they ended up getting behind the IRS and now they're overwhelmed by it.  So they ignore it and all these problems just, you know, start to compound, you know? And so  that's basically what we try to avoid. And so even though our company has evolved and we've got  companies that are 20, 30, 40, 50 million dollar companies that we do high level tax planning for,  I have always stayed very passionate about helping people kind of in that startup mode. And they're,  they're really just, you know, doing their first side hustle or they're, they're just throwing  themselves into their first business. Cause I know that all the magic happens by helping them build  the foundation correctly in the beginning stages. Because what I've seen, even with successful  business owners is five, six, seven years in, they realize like, holy crap, man, I made  a ton of mistakes. I didn't know I shouldn't have brought in a partner and we did an S corp together.  I didn't know I should have, you know, had an LLC and just stayed a partnership there and then  created an S corp later individually. I didn't know C corporations were a thing and that there's  tax advantages to that once I hit certain levels and I have certain goals. And so, you know, and  then what happens is they have to redo it. And so, and that's what, that's what we like to do is  like really help entrepreneurs, like get the information they need, inspire them to start  creating the right habits, tax wise, get the right foundation laid, you know, and, and that way as  they scale, you know, cause everybody wants to scale, everybody wants to become really scalable.  And it's like, they always focus on sales and marketing, you know, and then they focus on,  I don't know why it's doing that. They focus on sales and marketing and then they focus on  operations and then the money's part always comes last. And so we like to inspire people like,  Hey, do it all right now. Like get the foundation laid so you can focus on those things and not  scaling your money doesn't become an interruption of your business growth, you know, later when you  are trying to, you know, when you are doing great numbers, now it's super costly to redo everything  later on. So, so anyway, that's kind of a background as well as like what I want to talk about with,  with your community today is like really laying that foundation properly.  Okay, bro. And yeah, what I said right before you hopped on is I heard somebody say this a couple  years ago, they said, you know, a lot of people that do side hustles, they get frustrated because  they're just making like a little bit of money. And it's like, if you want to make professional  money, you need to treat this professionally. And so a lot of times we get into this, we treat it  like with something we're doing out of our mom's basement. And even if you are literally in your  mom's basement, or something equivalent, you could still treat this like you're sitting at the, you  know, at Kale's office at a corner office, and then this really nice building. But this is one  of those things where you need to have your, your, your, what is it, your I's dotted your T's crossed.  And so fortunately, my",

And so even when I was barely making money, like when I first started doing  business, I always like I set up my first business, I had it done with a professional,  like I never was. He always put that in my head. He's always, you're the you know, are you going  to lose the most money is like, I'm like, where he's like doing the turbo tax and the QuickBooks.  And so I never even questioned it because he ingrained it. But I know that that's not how  everybody grew up. I know a lot of my friends grew up. It's like, Dad, you know, he was a school  teacher. And so he just went on the turbo tax and it was 200 bucks. Like, no, you just lost money  because you're an idiot. So anyway, that said, dude, I want to give you the floor to do some  training on what you want to talk about ways that people can save money in 2024. And then if there's  time left, I've got questions on other people got questions. But yeah, let's, let's get  I would definitely love to open up some q&a. And I know Casey will jump in here as well. Because  I mean, Casey's on the front lines all the time, man. He's always staying up to date on  cool deductions and tax strategies that are counted as the CPAs are, are, you know,  implementing for our clients. And so but but yeah, dude, to get to get kind of started. I mean,  that is that is one thing I want to start off by saying, I kind of iterated it there in the intro  was like, really, we want to we want to get to a point of like financial security and abundance  as quickly as possible. And we and we want to scale to that to that level as soon as possible.  And so obviously, one thing I've realized with entrepreneurs is, do they they don't ever just  want one stream of income, they want multiple streams of income. And so what happens is,  they they end up creating all these different buckets of income. And then they sometimes  end up partnering on things like, for example, your business model is a beautiful business model.  There might be opportunities in the marketplace that come up like, hey, maybe they're sending  you more business and they've created a new stream of income, or maybe they end up building  a team where they're out there helping a bunch of other people in their community do what you're  doing. And you know, I mean, so it's like, there's all these different streams of income entrepreneurs  do once they start making more and more money, like, how can I scale? How can I scale? And so  let me see if I can bring up this one slide, I want to kind of do a little training on  Let me give you co host, then you want to share your screen? Are you going to show it on that  screen over there? Let me see how it looks real quick on on just the laptop. Okay, cool,  because either way, I'm not used to the whiteboard thing, man. I'm like,  this is so interesting, you know, but I want to learn it.  It's all good, man. And I'm gonna do this. Hold on, let me see if I can give you like  spotlight so that it shows just your face alone. Yeah. Okay, it's spotlighting the whiteboard.  But I'm getting, I'm getting that like 1000 different tiles showing into eternity, you know,  let me try some here.",

And then kind of give them a good I want I want people to understand kind of now and  the future and why it's so beneficial for them to get all structured properly, you know, so  can you see that slide? Yeah, that's that's I can see it. Guys, let me know in the comments,  you can see it. I can see it pretty well. So I think I think it's pretty solid. Yeah.  Okay, so I'll walk you through some of this stuff. This is this is important stuff. I  really hit home, I've went and talked to some groups before. And you know, we spend a lot of  time on this, because, you know, really, the first understanding that we have to create as we are  starting a business is like, there's there's different kinds of income that the IRS looks  at, right? And one of them is, you know, active income, which is all your business activities,  and then business owners, they either want to go create multiple streams of income, because they  get good at business, or they want to start diversifying and building passive streams of  incomes, you know, which is buying assets and, you know, things that are taxed at capital gains  rates. And so we have to we have to have an understanding of like, what, what am I making?  What am I doing right now? It's like, okay, well, you're doing active income with your business  model, Nick, like this, what they're doing, they're doing active income. But as you if you want to  become scalable, you really want to create security, you know, one day, you're going to  have to start investing. Well, when you start buying stocks that you hold for over a year,  you start buying assets that you hold for over a year, like rental properties or whatever,  the appreciation on those gains is taxed at passive income. Well, we don't want that to pass  through to us as active income, you know, because then we're going to get taxed at earned income  rates, you know, which can be, you know, well, it can be 15% up to 37%, right? Plus your stake  taxes. And, you know, and then there's a lot of double taxation, we got to look out for on the  active income streams as well. Like right now, when you're not making any money, or you're just  starting to make a little bit, you don't obviously start paying taxes until you start becoming  profitable. Okay, once you become profitable, if you're just set up as a single member LLC,  or a sole proprietorship, which is just doing business in your name, you know, the income's  all passing through to you directly, and you're going to get taxed your earned income rates,  which is the 15 to 30%, plus your state taxes, if you're in a state where there's state taxes,  and then you're going to also pay the self-employment taxes. And the self-employment  taxes are basically the, the social security for both the employee and the employer. Well,  they're saying, well, hey, you're self-employed, it's all flowing through to you. So you need to  pay all of it. So it ends up being 15.3%. Right? So, and so, so people start doing the math,  and they're like, man, like, I'm paying 40, 45, 50% in taxes on this income that's flowing  through to me. Then",

    "pageContent": "they're like, I started this as a side hustle, so I could quit my job. They're  like, man, I'm never gonna be able to quit my job when I'm, you know, literally having to give  half of it back to the, to the government, you know? And so one of the biggest tax savings that  we can create for people is helping them understand where to start and when the right time is to  switch to an S corporation. Okay? But we don't want people to do it incorrectly. And so I built  this little diagram to give people kind of an idea. And, and this is a little outdated. Some of these  companies that have sold, like I'm not a part of RBO anymore. I've sold that. I sold you tax over  here. I am still owner of these other companies. And then, you know, I have some other things like  coffee shops now that me and my wife are doing it. So this is outdated. This isn't, this isn't my  exact situation anymore. I need to jump in and update it one of these days. But if you look at,  if you look at what we got going on right in the center, it says KG3 Corp. KG3 Corp is an S  corporation. All these other entities are either LLCs or LLC partnerships. Down here, my rental  properties at the bottom, those are all holding LLC companies. Okay? So some are flowing directly  through me. Some are flowing directly to my corporation, which is then where I pay myself.  And so a lot of people are asking question when they get started, like, do I even need to set up  an LLC? Right? And I always tell people like, absolutely do. Like there is no reason why you  shouldn't set up an LLC. An LLC doesn't really do a whole lot to save you money on taxes because  it's taxed just like a sole proprietorship is. Okay? But a sole proprietorship, the money flows  directly through you. Same with an LLC. And then there's also the S corporation. Okay? And so  the S corporation is taxed as a corporation. The benefit of that is you don't have to pay the 15.3%  self-employment taxes, but there's some rules. Like, first of all, you have to pay yourself a  fair and reasonable salary. And what the IRS says is they say it's fair and reasonable. That's all  they put in there. They don't give any stipulations or guidance on it. They say you just have to pay  yourself a fair and reasonable salary for your duties of the job. So somebody could be, let's just  give an example. Let's say you start this business and you decide, hey, I want to set up as an LLC.  And here's the benefit of setting up as an LLC. First of all, you get to create separation between  you and the business. Okay? So now we can establish a lot of really good habits, right? Like we can,  you know, separate the business transactions from the personal transactions. We go down to our bank,  we take our EIN, we set up the bank account numbers, totally separate from us. There's liability  protection. If anyone tries to sue the business, they can't sue me as long as I don't do any  commingling. If they try to sue me, they can't sue the business. So I've got separation between me  and the business. So there's all these benefits. I tell people, absolutely, you should always set  up an LLC. There's very rare situations that you should not set up an LLC, right? And so I always  tell people, LLC is great, okay? And they're usually super affordable. Some",

    "pageContent": "states, they have  high state fees, but most of the time they're super affordable. It's worth setting up just  to establish the right habits and the separation for the legalities, okay? But we're still being  taxed at earned income rates and we're still being taxed like a sole proprietorship. We're still  liable to pay those self-employment taxes, but that doesn't matter until we're profitable,  okay? Well, what pass-through means, Nick, is pass-through means the deduction, the income  flows through directly to you and that's where you get taxed, but then so do all the deductions.  So we like to teach people like, hey, set up an LLC, create as many tax deductions as possible.  We don't want to become super profitable until we absolutely start outweighing all of the  deductions that we possibly can. We want to pay as little as possible as far as taxes go.  Anyway, so we like to set up the LLC to start, okay? And then we like to educate people. When  is the right time to switch to an S corporation? Well, because an S corporation does have a little  bit higher cost tax return and it has some compliance, things like setting up some payroll  and there's a little payroll cost to pay yourself a fair and reasonable salary to get out of those  self-employment taxes. We like to tell people like, hey man, as soon as you start outweighing  all your deductions and you start getting to the point where you're making $20,000 a year profit,  it's really beneficial to start looking at switching to an S corporation. But there's a  lot of mistakes that happen along the way when people go to CPAs or attorneys to do this because  a lot of times CPAs and attorneys, they're just looking at it as a tax law. They'll tell you to  switch too soon or they'll tell you to switch too late because they're just looking at it from  a taxation point. And so they're not looking at it like from a business owner perspective.  And so a business owner perspective, we want to have sometimes multiple structures created to  create the best tax savings opportunity and get out of the self-employment taxes, maximize as many  deductions as we possibly can. So to break it down in kind of simple math, let's just say,  easy for math, you go start the side hustle, you're a couple of years in, boom, you're making  $100,000 a year profit. Well, you're probably going to end up paying about, on the profit,  just as an LLC, you're going to end up paying $35,000 to $45,000 after the self-employment taxes  directly to the IRS. And so that's a huge tax liability people don't want. But if you switch  at the right time to an S corporation, well, then you're eliminating the 15.3% right off the top.  And you've created the separation between you and the business to create a lot more different  tax strategies to reduce the taxation even more. And so I built this diagram just to break it down.  So I keep all of my partnerships and all of my single-member LLCs,  all, which are all the ones that have the arrows pointing to the KG3 Corp. I keep all those LLCs.  I don't switch any of them to S corporations. And then I flow them all to my S corporation,  which is there where I pay my, that's where I pay myself a fair and reasonable salary. And that's  where I end up taking most of my personal tax deductions that aren't tied to all my different  partners and all my different business ventures. And so this is the foundation we like to lay with  entrepreneurs early on so that they can gain an",

    "pageContent": "understanding of like,  okay, when is the right time to switch to an S corporation? How can I flow my money to me without  being double-taxed? And so this is the best way to do it, depending on your situation. Some people  are in different situations. We've had people come to us where they have disability or they have a  high-income earning spouse, or they have a partner that's overseas and so they need a S corporation.  So there's different situations for different people that we have to take into consideration  that we do consult on before we do anything. But this is like a good broad diagram that we built  just to help people kind of understand the benefits of LLCs, creating separation, maximizing deductions,  flowing it to you personally so you don't get double-taxed to keep majority of the money that  you're making as a business owner. So just to understand your setup is KG3 is an S Corp  and these other entities are LLCs that flow into KG3, but KG3 is what actually pays you.  Yeah, exactly. And I know I like to paint this future picture, Nick, just to give people  understanding of like, okay, like this seems like it could be a complex thing, but people are like,  where can I start now? Do I need an LLC right now? And so I like to paint this picture  for people because I don't want to see them make the mistakes that a lot of business owners make  later when they do get to the point where they're like, hey, I'm starting to become profitable,  and I have a partner and they go to talk to an accountant or a CPA and the CPA is like,  well, you're going to save 15.3% by switching to an S Corp. Well, now your partner and you have  an S Corp together, but now you guys have joined each other together on this corporation. When you  didn't have to do that, you could have kept your business in LLC and you could have just each set  up your own individual S corporations. And now you guys have the independence, right? So this  partner over here can go and build other multiple streams of income and assets that flow to him.  And you can go and build multiple streams of income separately, but you still have your thing  together in the LLC, but you each have your own individual S corporations. And then that's  where you kind of fully control your tax liability. And so that's like one of the biggest mistakes I  see for people as they scale and grow a business and create multiple streams of income is they end  up forming their S corporation when it's time to switch to an S corporation and they keep their  partner on it. And so that's a big thing I like to educate people on the future side of things.  But right now, while we're just getting started, I like people to understand the benefits of just  getting an LLC, maximizing as many deductions as possible to keep as much money as you possibly can  and then switch to an S corporation when the time is right based on you and then doing it properly  by keeping it S corporation solely under you and not tying yourself to any partners with that  down the road. So I like to paint that future picture, but then I like to help people  understand the benefits of setting up an LLC right now for the legalities and all the tax  incentives and the separation that they can create or the, you know, incentives that they  do create by creating that separation. So anyway, does that make sense so far?  Yeah, no, no, no. So, and I think it's smart because you guys, once you, you know, some of  you guys are brand new to business, first time ever. And you realize what, like, I'm sure",

And the hardest part is just not getting shiny  penny syndrome, to be honest, but you are going to find you're going to have multiple streams of  income. That's just inevitable. One of the questions I had, and I think you just nailed  it just to clarify. So your suggestion would be for anybody that's new, a good first step would  be set up an LLC slash start getting as many tax deductions as possible. That's like an amazing  first step. Totally, totally. And honestly too, like just having that entity set up properly,  because here's the thing, like you're going to go out and you're going to start establishing like,  okay, so I'm in digital landlords. I'm going out to find my first client. My first client,  he's like, Hey, I want to, I want to pay you on my, my MX every month for this deal. We've created  it. Well, now you need a merchant account and a merchant account doesn't want to, you know,  they don't, you know, like, you know how merchant accounts are Nick, they're pain in the ass,  you don't want to go set up a merchant account right now in your name. And then later be like,  Oh, I actually need a new merchant account because I want to set up an LLC because I figured out,  I have all this liability and I want all these tax incentives. And so then they're like, Oh,  cool. Now you need a whole new merchant account. Now you're trying to make a new, you know,  you're trying to make your, you're trying to season another merchant account, right? And you  have to kind of start over. And so, you know, that's just like one example of like, why not  just set up an LLC now if it's affordable for you, right? Cause like some States are 25 bucks,  right? It's like 25 bucks, state filing fees, set up an LLC. Now you have an EIN number. Now  you're protected legally. Now you can go start establishing bank accounts, merchant accounts,  contracts, agreements with your clients, like all these things under this company,  which is totally separate from you for the liability protection. And you can start taking  all your deductions, keeping your books totally separate from you. There is no, as long as you  really do a good job at setting up bank accounts and keeping those expenses separate, set up a  QuickBooks account or set up some spreadsheets. And now you're keeping everything separate from  you. And you're establishing really, really valuable habits early on in your business to not  only help you keep more, more money that you make, but, but really like, you know, like you're,  you're getting it all set up properly in the beginning stages. You don't have to redo it all  later. Cause if you set up your structure, you're flowing correctly. And then later you figure out,  you know what, I should, I should have been a C Corp or you know what I set up on as a C Corp  on accident. Now I need to go back and do this in LLC. Well, now you have to go redo all those  things. You have to get new merchant accounts, new agreements, new insurance policies, new bonds. If  you need bonds with your state, new like everything under this new entity, because everybody views an  entity as a totally separate entity. It's, it's not you anymore. And it's not this other company  anymore. So if",

    "pageContent": "you have to redo it, it's like, man, that causes a huge interruption in your  business. So starting with an LLC is very wise because one, if you're the sole owner of the  business and you decide to switch it to an S corporation later on, you can, or if you decide  to switch it to a C corporation later, you can, you know, and like, and that's, and that's necessary  at times as well. If you scale really massively and you'd be end up becoming, you know, creating  this business venture to something very large, you can switch to a C corporation and avoid paying  taxes on the first $10 million that you make in the sell of your business later on. But you have  to be a C corporation for five years. And so I tell you all that just because an LLC is very  versatile. Start now, create the habits, get the EINs, get everything set up properly. And then later,  if it makes sense, switch it to an S corp or set up a totally separate S corp if you have partners.  And then later, you know, if you, if you decide I'm gonna switch it to a C corp, because I want to  sell this business one day for 20, 30, 40, $50 million, well, you want to make that first 10 million  totally tax free, you know, so there's all these cool benefits that you can do from being an LLC  and switching later on or just adding entities like I've done for later on as well. So if I  ever sold, for example, easier accounting, I would, I would, I would just flow that to my,  my S corporation, or maybe by that time, hopefully I've switched to a C corporation,  you know, so there's just there's benefits that you can do to, to  just from starting as an LLC and keeping it very simple, and then understanding these things as you  grow. We have a question that is pertinent to what you just said. It said, Stephen says,  for those just starting out, do you recommend getting the LLC in the state you live in? He said,  Pennsylvania for me as an example, having Google or YouTube this once I get ads now for all sorts  of states, LLC is now algorithm. So yeah, should they do it in the state that they're in?  I want to, I want to save people a ton of money by not getting scammed. Okay.  When you get on the, when you get into business and you set up your first LLC,  you're going to start getting a lot of advertisements and stuff saying, Hey,  set up in Delaware, set up in Nevada. Okay. Now there's benefits to that. Okay. However,  they don't usually apply. Okay. The IRS is if you ever get audited, they are going to treat you  based on where your taxable presence is, you know, so if you're in Pennsylvania and you got sold by  somebody who says, Hey man, set up a Nevada corporation because now you don't pay state taxes.  That is a big audit waiting to happen that you will lose because they're going to be like,  do you have no taxable presence in Nevada? Why are you trying to say you're in Nevada?  You know, a business paying about a taxes plus as an LLC, it all flows to you directly anyway.  So I get probably, I don't know, a hundred people every year that are like, Oh man,  I set up in Nevada. I'm like, okay, cool. Why? And they're like, well, because I don't pay state  taxes. I'm like, well, that's not true. Okay. Or I talk to people in California that",

Well, I set up in Nevada and I got audited.  California, they're like ninjas, man. They will find you. Cause if you put anyone on payroll  in Pennsylvania or even yourself on payroll in Pennsylvania, but your entities in Nevada,  there's like all these things that will trigger them to investigate that. Right. And so your  taxable presence is where you're at because you're the business. And then as the organization grows  and say, you remove yourself from the business and you, for example, wanted to move to Nevada  and become a resident of Nevada or Puerto Rico or Florida or wherever there's no freaking state  taxes. Well, then you can set up your S corporation as a consulting company, consulting your other  entities and flow money to you without paying state taxes. Right. But you got to go live there.  Right. Because now you're a consultant out of Florida, you're a consultant out of Nevada,  you know, and you're, those are the states that you're actually in where your taxable presence  is. And so I hate when people fall for that scam. Now there is anonymity. So in Delaware, Nevada,  Wyoming, there is anonymity saying, well, sorry, can you, sorry. Oh, yeah. Okay. Sorry. My screen  changed. Okay. And so I just have you on this conversation. Oh, just me and you. No, everyone  can see you, but I just changed. You're the spotlight and I'll change it back when you're  done talking. Okay. Okay. So basically, and so basically to save you a ton of money,  I always tell people, like, dude, just set up in your state. That's going to save you a ton of  money. Not it's going to, you know, avoid a ton of headaches later down the road. There are very  cool strategies later that you can create by setting up entities in other states, but the whole  anonymity laws are great because, you know, like it shields you. Like if somebody was going to sue  you, like, let's just say you had a crazy ex wife. It's like, I know he's got like all these assets  he's bought with this new business. He started in digital landlords. And like, let's say you wanted  to hide a piece of land from a crazy ex spouse or, you know, or an ex business partner that's always  trying to sue you or whatever, right? Like you could go set that up as just a holding LLC that  owns land in Delaware or owns land or Wyoming or Delaware LLC that owns land in these other states,  but it's just shielding you from them, but you got to set them up properly. And so most people,  even when they set up a Nevada or Delaware corporation, they don't even set them up properly.  They end up setting them up and then they list themselves as an officer. So now they're public  information anyway, you know, so you have to actually go set, like hire an attorney to set  up the entity act as the officers of the corporation or the entity to totally shield you from the entity  and then all of your ownership is basically created in agreements with that attorney or  that law firm in order to fully shield it from you. So when you get to the point of where you're  really wealthy and you're starting to set up trusts and land trusts, and you want to hide assets and  really keep your name off of them, then you talk about like Nevada, Delaware, Wyoming entities,  but when you're just starting a business, there's a money trail",

So I know that gets a little bit long,  but there is, you know, a lot of that I want to help people avoid by not getting scammed because  I know there's companies out of Nevada and stuff that will call and sell you Nevada corporation  and they'll charge you five, six, $7,000 for this corporate package, making it sound like you're  never going to pay state taxes and you're going to have all these privacy laws and then they don't  even set them up properly for the privacy laws. And so typically 99% of the time you don't want  to set up out of your own state. Makes sense. Okay. So here's what I want to do really quick  in our last few minutes. Because I know some people might hop off right at the,  at the hour mark, whatever, but I have a couple of questions that people did ask that I think  are really interesting that we should answer. But if like, I would suggest guys, this is what I did  when I first got started is like, you got to talk to somebody, figure out what your situation is,  what the best, you know, like way forward is whatever. So what's the best way that somebody  didn't want to reach out and like, for example, we had a question just barely asking about a  specific situation. How can people get in contact with you if they want to call and just kind of  talk through their situation? Yeah, we put together a link just for digital landlords. I'm gonna have  case and pull this up. So you guys can scan a QR code for it right now off the other screen.  If you want to highlight that one, Nick, but that's just, it's really just a QR link going to  link that we built just for the digital landlords community. That way it's tagged to your community  where we give you guys a full, a free tax assessment, because I know we're getting in,  we're in the fourth quarter of the year, first of all. So if you guys jump on the phone with our  team, you know, we're not going to talk about just LLCs and everything. We're going to actually talk  about you guys, your goals. We're going to talk a little bit about the future stuff, but we're  going to talk about all the things you can do right now this year to start saving money because you  started this business in this year, which means we can take a ton of deductions this year for your  home office, for your vehicle, for your business bills, for your travel, for your laptop, your  cell phone, your cell phone bills, your utilities, like all these things that you spend money on  personally every year anyway. We want to show you guys how you can deduct those and pass it through  to you. Whether you're an LLC, whether you're a sole proprietorship, whether you're a corporation,  we want to help create an assessment for you guys where we can help you understand like, wow,  this business is really benefiting me this year because when people go spend money to start a  business, dude, they're like, holy crap, like it takes a little time before I start making a little  bit of money. How can I get more money to put back into the business or how can I put more money back  in my pocket to recoup costs? Well, when you set up an LLC and you strategize, all these deductions  pass through to you directly anyway, so we offer this free assessment where people can literally,  we can get on our phone with our team, we can look at your lifestyle, a broad estimate of all  your",

So we can show people in  this assessment how much money they can really save. Can I jump in real quick and say, we typically  charge $400 for this assessment. We're doing it for free just for digital landlords. So like,  if you're on this call right now, seriously, I can't tell you how many times I've been in an event and  pulled up the QR code and thought, I need to go talk to my business partners. So I just open up  the window thinking of it back to it when I get back in town and coordinate with my business  partners. Don't do that. Click on this QR code right now. If you've got friends, family members,  or business partners that are involved with you, just put your information in. My team will reach  out. That way it's not an afterthought or something else you forget about. Now, another thing, I have  not made this free offer since January. And the reason for that is last time I did this,  people screenshot it, which is great. But there was 150 people at the event and we had 300  scheduled appointments. And so it got a little bit crazy. So again, this is for you, your friends,  family members, and business partners that are involved. But my team knows digital landlords  very well. They understand your business. But again, we need to get on and really assess what  your specific situation is and what your goals are to point you in the next right direction.  And I promise you, you're going to leave this call with better information when you got on this call.  So we're excited to work with you and appreciate everybody's time today.  Yeah. One thing I want to say on that is I know for me, when I was looking to get a new attorney  to potentially set up my trust, I reached out and I think it was like $250 or $300 an hour.  And so I did pay that just to do an initial consultation. So what these guys are offering  is like, hey, get on a call, let's look at your situation, see where you can save some money,  see if you should set up an LLC. And anyway, I would just recommend if you guys want to make  professional money, as I said in the beginning, you got to treat this professionally. So this is  just a free thing that you guys can check out and then you can just go from there. And they  just literally just scan that with their phone and then they can put in their information.  I think I actually shared the link with you in our chat, Nick, if you want to share it in the  comments or something, because I don't know if I have that ability, right? And if you want,  we can give you the link, you can email us all of them or however you want to do it. But yeah,  the QR code is in the same place. It's just for us to grab the information so we can reach out  and just get you on the calendar. And then at the end of the day, man, it's like, yeah, we love  earning business. We love helping people and going ahead and doing the structures for them. We do it  all very affordably. But at the end of the day, we really want to provide enough value to where  if somebody even can't hire us right now, it's like, we still want to head you in the right  direction, give you direction this year to save as much money as",

It's an awesome consultation, customized around you, your goals  for the business and show you how we can to show you how we can help you save money now  and down the road. So so I just barely dropped a link on the in the comments and I'll try to  include the link as well. I'll edit the live and post it there. But yeah, we'll try to like email  this out. Let me just see one more thing. Let's just answer two questions quick and then pop off  you can. Is that okay, Kale? And as you want, man, we'll answer any questions you have.  Okay, so real quick, Nick, Nick, I'm gonna ask this one because he's actually in St. George.  He went to Utah Tech and stuff. And he said, random question, is your firm well versed in handling  1031 exchanges? I'm seeking a reputable local firm to assist me in the process.  Yep, we can do 1031s. We do cost tags, real estates, one of one of the fields that we do,  we do a lot of work in and very, very well. Yeah, most of our most of our clients are  e commerce or real estate, you know, and so, yeah, we're pretty well versed in all of that. So  made absolutely. Okay, another one quick says, I set up my own LLC in Nevada and filed. This is  more just a comment. Nevermind. This is just stating something. What this is a question  that says from Juan says, What about creating a trust and having all the LLC inside the trust?  And it sounded like based on what you were saying is that's like when you get into the big money,  it's not necessarily right off the bat. But what do you want to talk about?  Very, very careful, because there's a lot of different ways that trust or structure,  there's a lot of different ways that the trust can own that business. And if it's done wrong,  you're going to wind up paying trust taxes, which is the absolute highest tax rate that there is.  And so that's one thing where great idea to be to be thinking at that higher level.  But do not like, please do not do that without a lot of consultation with a tax professional  and an attorney. Okay, I hope that answered. Let's see, Matt Torres said, he said, so starting  the business as an LLC first, then later converting to an S corp or forming an S corp separately is a  better strategy rather than leaving it as an LLC for the long run?  Well, I mean, it depends. Like, so for example, if you do have a business partner, or, you know,  like, let's just say you're a personal trainer, and you're an LLC, and then you meet somebody,  and they're like, Hey, we should build gym equipment together. And you know,  now you have a partnership and, you know, like, it's, it's, it's best to leave them all in LLCs  when you start involving other people. And then just forming a totally separate S corporation  that you now are flowing the money to. So for example, if me and Nick are in business together,  and we go create an entity together, but we have all these other things, it's, it's not wise for us  to go switch it to an S corp. Once it becomes profitable, it's wise for us to actually just set  up our own S corporations. And instead of flowing the money",

    "pageContent": "directly to us, now we float to our S  corporation, which is then where we pay ourselves. However, staying in LLC long term, that's totally  fine. Until if you're even if you're a single member, until you start making 30, 40, $50,000  a year and up, if then it's wise to switch it to an S corporation, right. And so, but  if you know, you're just entrepreneurial, and you know, I'm going to go start other companies,  I tell people it's best to just leave it in an LLC and go form a separate S corporation,  and start doing that flow right now. Because you already know, you're going to go create these  other LLCs, and you'd rather them all just flow to this S corporation. So, so it really just depends  on your goals and the situations. If you know, like, I'm not going to do anything else, this is  it, you know, then let's just switch that LLC to an S corp. You know, no, and you don't have  any partners in it. No sweat. You're like, hey, I know, I just want to make 15, 20 grand a month,  I'm good with that. You know, I just, you know, I don't want to have partners, I don't want it,  I just want to keep it super simple. Well, then we can switch it to an LLC, LLC, to an S corp,  and you get the same tax savings, you know. And so, so it really just depends on you, your situation.  But I hope that answers the question. It just there is somebody. Yeah, I think it just I think  if anyone has questions that specific like that, just jump on and talk to case and talk to kale,  they'll answer it for your situation. So it's pretty simple. The other thing, this is a side  note that I never realized is like, down the road, if you guys want to, you know, buy real estate  with your company or whatever qualify for certain things, when if you're LLC, or your business is  like brand new, I mean, it's really, really difficult. So you want to get it set up now,  get it seasoned, get however many years of tax returns, because they're going to look at a brand  new business. And basically, you know, they're, they're not even going to consider it. So  that's another thing that you you have to you don't even think about these things until you  get in a situation, you're like, man, I wish I would have set that up five years ago.  Yeah, I always tell people when you set up an LLC, and this is another whole benefit of why you  should set them up early on, instead of waiting, is because you can you go get a DUNS number,  you start building credit to your corporation. And like, you know, and there's a lot of misleading  information out there, like, oh, yeah, once you set up, you know, you get corporate credit, you can  just transfer all the debts to the you know, off you to the business, and you're not liable to pay  them anymore. And it's like, that stuff's not true. There's, there's always like, a way it's  going to come back on you if you try and like, just walk away from a debt or something. But  there is a ton of benefits to corporate lines of credit, even if you are a personal guarantor,  there's loans you can get just through the company where you're not a signer on them.  And so and sometimes it takes a good couple years to really season",

So anyway, that's another benefit  of starting to set up an LLC now is you can open up more lines of credit and access to capital  through that entity by starting to establish some credit through it. Beautiful. I'll say this guys,  and what I'll try to do, Kay, I'll try to get an email put together and send it out to everyone  that missed this. But the thing that I like about these guys, for everyone that's watching this is  that, you know, a lot of times you deal with accountants, or you deal with these type of  firms, it's just like that, that old guy that's friends with your dad. And you guys are actually  business owners that understand business and accounting. And so I think that's important,  because I've had you know, I had an accountant for a while when I got started, he used to do my dad  stuff on the farm and everything. And he was good, but you had to tell him, hey, what about this?  What about this? What about this? He was an accountant, he was just like one of those purists,  he didn't really know business, if I don't even think he was making that much money, although he  knew the accounting, he wasn't a business owner. So that's one benefit with these guys is they're  actually business owners that happen to know accounting very well. So anyway, we're going to  put together an email, I did drop the link. And we will, yeah, guys, just jump on, check out what  they can do. If anything, suggestions, if nothing else, you guys get some ideas and go from there.  Yeah, no, we appreciate it, man.  Beautiful. I'm sure we'll come. I'm sure we'll do another one, where we can just like maybe we can  gather a bunch of questions and just have like, I bet we could spend an hour just on q&a, which  could be a cool part to this. So I'll message you guys will chat and see. This has been really  beneficial. And I actually learned quite a bit. And I've been trying to piece this stuff together  for years. So appreciate you guys.  Well, it was a zoom call. So I was like, trying to bounce around.  It was good. You know, for sure. Well, don't appreciate you encasing up and on. And yeah,  guys, you feel that out. They'll reach out schedule a call and see, you know, what you guys some  of the next steps you guys can take if you choose to do so. So awesome. Thanks, guys.",

    "pageContent": " Okay, Franco says question, how many campaigns should we launch simultaneously when starting out to increase chances? So this is my rule of thumb, Franco really, really quick answer is, as long as you're not going to trigger, you know, whatever, Google to spend your account, doesn't matter how many you start as long as what I what I my rule of thumb is like if you have five that are set up right now right as soon as they start going popping off.  I like to have like I would recommend in the beginning having one that's going so if you want to set up five and then have the ads on and then all of a sudden once one takes off you pause the other great.  What I don't recommend is having five or 10 I know you guys want to get like some of you guys want to be at 50k today, which I love.  But you also got to realize that you just started, and you got to, like, you got to take these steps, there's going to be steps to get there. And so, you can't short like you're not going to shortcut you still got to put in the work so don't go set up 10 campaigns  and be spending all this money you're going to chase, if you're chasing I hate this saying but like you chase multiple rabbits you don't catch any right.  So, I've noticed there's a threshold for me even that is very very I'm very good at managing multiple campaigns. When I get over five.  I get it. I stopped giving attention to each campaign, and it in it, it kills me quite it kills me period. Okay. So my advice is if you're on your first deal.  Okay, and if it's not producing get another one set up and then once if the first one starts producing pause the second one. Okay, go get one folks on one period if you guys have ever been in a situation where have you guys ever been in a situation where you have  like three deals and they all end up lining up on the same deal.  And you're so excited that you rush through the first one and you just barely miss it but you're like, ah, it's okay because I'm going to go on this other one.  And then you get on the other one, and you kind of do the same thing and then all of a sudden you're at the end of the day and all three of them were like, eight out of 10 but none of them will close right sucks.  The same exact thing like sometimes I if I feel too overwhelmed. I'll just schedule one sales call and that day if I'm feeling really tired or whatever, give all my energy I'll close it, I'll schedule the next one the next day because I want to focus on that one.  Okay, so anyway, that should answer your question, set up one.  Close it. Then once you're comfortable getting a deal with one, go to two, and go to three, and I would say the threshold as of right now with what I've experienced it's like four to five, but I've been I've been doing this for two years.",

The reason why is because you want to make sure that you are protected legally in the  future for your website.  And so we go to the very bottom, right here, where it says Side Power by Nick Wood, you're  going to click in this section that Weebly automatically creates for you.  So this is not a section that we made previously in our framing asset video.  This is something that is automatically created for you.  So once you have created this, this is where we're going to add the terms of service for  your website, the privacy policy, and this is where you're going to add the fact that  you're affiliated to your client and you can also add, and it would suggest you're doing  so to avoid any trouble, you're going to add the contractor license of your client  right here at the bottom.  So let's get it started.  You're going to drag the text right here, okay?  You're going to add another text right here.  Alright, and we like to use this free tool called Terms Feed that generates privacy policies  for you.  It's very simple.  So I already have this pulled up, you're going to search for app.termsfeed.com and it's going  to take you right here and we are going to generate the terms and conditions first.  So click on here, click on start, select website, okay, the URL is whatever we bought earlier  from GoDaddy.  So make sure you copy and paste that in here.  The name of the website is in my case, Queen Creek Concrete, payment individual, oops,  individual, okay, enter, make sure the correct country is selected, select your state, no,  no, okay, this is going to be by visiting a page on our website, which again, put the  domain in here and the phone number is whatever you purchased on CallRail.  Let's see, hopefully I don't have to pull that back up for you.  Okay, your tracking number, so copy and paste it, next step, email address, so wherever  you want this privacy policy to be sent to, okay, generate and boom.  So you're going to copy this, now open a new tab, paste that in there, click search  and it's right here.  So copy this link again and you're going to, right at the bottom, you're going to type  terms and conditions, select all of it, insert a link, a website URL, you're going to paste  that same link, click out of it, reselect, let's bold it, underline it and let's make  it a color so people know that they can click on it, can make it red, perfect.  And now we are going to, let's align this, okay, actually delete the spacer right here  and again, make sure you add there, you're an affiliated company with your client and  put the license and contractor, okay, we're going to name this privacy policy, okay, back  to terms feed, so we can close this out, click on the logo, it should take you back to the  homepage, okay, perfect, privacy policy start, website, same thing, phone number, I would  just keep every tab open with everything that you need because these keep reoccurring and  you always need them so I would just leave it like it is, same as earlier, individual  United States, make sure you're putting every information correctly, email first number,  first name and phone number, visiting, same, oops, that's fine, put that phone number,  next step, no, we just want the basic one and generate, oops,",

So here's my thoughts is the same thing with tree service at some point, like if we looked at concrete today. Right. And we said is concrete more saturated with lead generators today than it was a year ago.  Yes or no. Yeah, obviously right it's the same thing with tree service couple years tree service was like this thing that was ready to go and take, take by the throat and whatever right.  In 2020, I made a money, a bunch of money on tree service. I haven't built a tree service site in 18 months. So, do I think there's going to be certain niches that we're going to want to say okay this niche is getting hit pretty hard.  Sure. Yes, 100%. And I have a YouTube video if I can if you can message me I can share it with you, where I talk about this with tree service as an example.  But here's something we're not considering.  Just because you guys got to hear this, just because you see another lead generator in your city does not rule it out.  I thought for the longest time, I will do my research I'm like oh, okay, let's look at this city, and I was like, I would type it in I'm like concrete St. George.  And I'm like, I'm blinking I'm like please tell me there's not only generated I'm scrolling up I'm scrolling up like, oh, gosh, dang it. And I would go and look at when it was index and I was like, dang it I missed it.  I should have done it last year I know I should have done it last year.  And I every time I would see a lead generator I would just run.  And then one day, this is in my own backyard, I started looking at tree service in St. George, Utah.  And then I saw there was a site and I thought, dang it and then you know what I did is like, I'm like, you know what, I'm going to call this site, and I called the website did not call the ads they weren't running ads and guys if you start calling  people's ads I'm going to freaking knock you out do not call someone's ads, especially if they're running ads, and you know they're in this group because they probably are. Don't click on someone's ads that's messed up.  Okay.  I clicked on their organic listing, and I call them. And no one answered I was like dude these guys are on a client, I could tell no one answered I was texting whatever.  And then I found out who it was I think they left their name at the bottom I looked them up on Facebook we had some mutual friends because they were in one of my other groups and I said hey, I saw that you own this site.  Would you be willing to sell it because it looks like you don't have a client. And I don't know if that pissed them off but basically it was like, Nope, Nope, Nope. And I said, Okay, cool.  And then I thought, Dude, even with that website in the top five or three whatever it was.  It's still low hanging fruit. There's still not that much competition.  I'm just going to build it anyway. And my thinking was honest this is when I started to get like the abundance mentality Brian, as I started thinking, dude, there's more than one trade company in this area that's willing to pay for leads there has to be.  And those guys don't even have a client, but even if they did, there has to be more than one company that's willing to pay for advertising.  And so I freaking, I just",

So, long way of answering your question do I think there's going to be some niches course, there's going to be some, but you also have to remember just because you see a lead generator doesn't mean that it rules it out.  Okay, that's number one.  Number two.  We're always going to be discovering new niches so just so everybody knows, I am currently testing out four to five new niches, and I will probably have kind of my, my breadwinner niche for 2023, that I will be able to say hey this is what I'm focusing on this year in  In 2021, it was artificial grass, and then this year it's been concrete. Okay.  2023 is probably going to be something else but guess what you guys know about me.

Okay, yeah, I'm a spoiled princess for sure, so.  Yeah, all right, what's up, man, what can we help you with?  Yeah, I got a couple of questions, and I don't know if I'm still going through the training, I'm not sure if this is in the training.  Keyword near me.  Is that a legit keyword? I know it's expensive, but what do you think?  Towing, not towing, like tree service near me.  So, okay, it depends on, like, in bigger cities, it's a very valuable keyword, and they charge, like, well, they're always going to charge a premium for that, and it's nothing, what's interesting about the near me is like, you and I never type that.  That is always an auto filled world by Google, so when you're typing it and you see it, you're like, yeah, near me, like, yeah, of course, like, I want to go, you know, I want to get sushi near me, yes, near me, I don't want to drive 15 miles, right?  So it's a premium term that's like auto populated typically by Google, so they charge a premium on it because there is like a little, like a location signal, right, like an antenna from your website or your address or your Google business profile.  So they're always going to charge more for it.  It's a very valuable word, so if it's in your budget to do it, what I would recommend is you running, if you're seeing a good or a decent amount of search volume for that term, I put the brackets around it to make it an exact match just for that term.

And typically, you'll see a big difference between the two. Yeah. Is it necessary? It's not necessary. If you guys are targeting, you know, lower population cities and there's not like a crap ton of competition out there.  When there's a lot of competition, that's where that's like that. That might be where I put that differentiation in of doing something that's going to have that a little bit, a little more dialed or focused. Does that help?  Yeah, yeah, no, it totally makes sense. So, so, okay, kind of having an idea, do I need it if I'm in a high competition kind of area or whatever I'm doing.  So that's the question I have to ask. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And it's not necessarily something that you have to have. It's just, it's a nice thing to have. Yeah. Can I show you, can I share my screen and show you my current deal?  I should be able to, it should be open to.  How about that? You see that? Uh huh. Okay. So, this is a campaign, let's see, started just a little over a week ago.  So we're just coming out of that learning phase. Yeah, yeah. So, hitting about only 375 and click through rate, nine clicks. I've had a couple of calls.  In fact, I was working, trying to sell, trying to rent this out to a local guy, but I lost him. He was stuck on this Google ad thing.  But as I go through here, and again, I'm pretty new with Google ads, the question I have under the ad group, I can click on ad group and then take a look at each of the terms, correct?  Uh huh. So these terms are ones that Google is adding in the searches. Is that correct?  So like here, let me get, actually, let me back that off. I don't understand that question. Okay.  So like, let's go to like tree removal search terms.  Okay, so these are under the search terms. I'm getting impressions on them, but I didn't, I didn't put these in here.  Okay, so yeah, so there's a different, okay, go back to keywords. Let me, I think I can explain this to you in a better way.  You're on it though, but okay. So when we, when we say like you have an exact match and you have phrase match keywords in there, right?  Yeah. Okay. So obviously exact match, like tree removal is only going to be tree removal, but like tree service with a phrase match.  So like typically any query within that area that you're throwing your ads to that has the term or phrase tree service in it is going to have the potential to throw your ad out to it.  Okay. So it, so it's so the search term report, if you go back to that.  What was I on tree trimming?  Actually, if you think you can actually get it on your left, cause you're just, so you're just looking at it on one word right now.  But if you just go, that's right. But look in the left column. Now go up, go up under insights and reports, go up, up, up right there. Search terms. See that?  Go down a couple right there. That will give you all of them if you don't have it. So you have a filter turned on. So turn off the keyword tree trimming.  Yeah. Get rid of that. So this will show you all of the",

But like when we don't know and we're just trying to see what's out there, we get that list of like our core keywords and we throw them out there as a phrase match. Right.  And so with that becomes a little bit of like broad match is terrible. So phrase match is better.  And so what you, but this is part of the first week and the second week is caving into your search terms here and getting rid of ones that you don't want your ad showing to. And a lot of them will be like, like able tree service. That's probably like that's a branded search term.  You already excluded it. So those are like, that's what you want to do the first week. And what that does is that helps train your ad to start getting better for that second week. And you do this again. And then by that third and fourth week is when it really starts getting better results.  And so over, over time though, let's say two, three, four months, like if you keep doing this and dialing in your ad and like you can get rid of, you can get rid of keywords. If you're like, this is just not producing or Hey, I got a bunch of like this, this and this, like three or four keyword searches.  that I'm getting a lot of impressions for, I'm going to make those an exact match and add those to my keywords. There's nothing wrong with that. Right. Okay. But it's a little beyond like the beginnings of it. This is just as you get into it and learn it.  Okay, yeah, that makes that makes sense, I guess. And I told Nick this on Monday, I'm just kind of impatient. So, so you know, eight days in, it's like, why am I not getting 10 calls a day? You know, so  yeah, it's Google is I say this, like, they're the largest advertising company in the world. They're there to make money first. And at the same time, like, you can only imagine the billions of amounts of like, or attempts at fraud every day that they get. So like, they're all so a lot of  times there are tweaks and adjustments could be a pain, pain in the butt to us. But they're doing it for a certain reason. So used to be able to kind of launch ads and within a couple days really get it going. And now it's like, that first week is just like, it's terrible. But it's designed so that what because what used to happen, a lot of people would do. So they would get an ad going. And as soon as it started, like, getting relevance and clicks, and this and that, people would go to the landing pages, and they would like redirect  certain like links and stuff. And so Google's now like, I'm going to make you sweat it out for a couple weeks now. Right? They want to make sure you're legit, make sure nothing's changing. So it's kind of like, like I've been saying for a while with the group and on the office offices, like, don't like, you should really reduce your expectations for the first two weeks. This is just where you manage and massage your you massage your ad to point it in the better direction to fine tune search terms  fine tune keywords, and make sure your butt because sometimes like, even a keyword planner, you're like, okay, this is this, here's the",

And you're like, holy crap, like that, that cost per click is like three times as much as what I just saw two weeks ago, that's sometimes that just happens. But that's why we try to spend those first week or two like, dialing in the ad, because then by week three, four and beyond, it's it's producing way  better quality leads for you and your business owner.  Okay, okay, that that makes sense. One last thing, still this. So instead of going down to campaigns and ad group to look at these search terms that they're adding or testing out, this is where I should go or should I because I or should I go?  So they're not they're not adding or testing these out. These are people in that area are actually searching this into Google. And because you have tree trimming, because you have tree removal, because you have tree services, tree trimming, tree service, tree removal, like all of those are in phrase matches. And because they're in phrase matches, they're going to show up in those queries that people are actually typing in, in the area you're running ads to.  I got it. Okay. So yeah, okay. So I'll go back through those and maybe for the next week, still keep chipping away at some of these.  Yeah, and I would I would more focus like, I think you have some good words there for trees, like, I would more focus on, like, monitoring what search terms those phrases are showing up for. And part of that will be like, let's say you see a lot of like free or cheap or price or how to's or whatever, like you can add those terms into a negative keyword on your negative keyword.  List. So if you want, I can quickly show you how to do that.  Yeah, I think I know. So like tree removal search terms, let's say I pick one cost of tree removal, and I just add it right there.  Yeah, yes. But okay, two things on that. That is correct. But that will add that 12345 word phrase as an exact match negative keyword.  Ah, okay. But let's say that when you're inspecting all of your search terms, you see like, not like like how much might be something but like how to free cheap cost pricing, like maybe things you don't want. You can go into if you go to the left and go down to keywords. Oh, sorry, it's right here. You're already on keywords right here. So you're already on keywords.  Here, go to the top and you'll see negative search keywords. See it? Okay, so these are ones that you've added. You see how they're bracketed. So those are exact matches, right? Yeah. Okay, but now let's let's go hit the plus sign.  Now let's add down there. Let's write. Let's just do example, you can go through this later, but add like how to because you don't want someone to be like, you don't want your ad running to someone who types, how to, how to trim my trees, or how to remove my tree, you're like, I don't want to spend my money or you're right. Okay, so do like, just type in that phrase, how to  as a bracketed. No, just type it in. How to. Good. Now go down. You'll hit save. Okay, and then as you go up there, did it save? Yeah, right. Okay, and see how it's a broad match? Yeah. Okay, so anything",

Same thing with the word free. Yeah. DIY. Yes. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So I don't need to do exact or phrase matching. It just well, I think that there's you got to do. I think there's a little bit of both. Like, if someone's typing in like, Kirk salsa tree service, that's a branded term, like I'll just throw it away because I don't want that competitor on there. It's an easy click and send it over. But if I'm seeing like, if I'm seeing, like,  I'm seeing, you know, and you don't have to do this, because  sometimes there's value in it, but it's up to you. But like,  you have one that's how much would it cost to remove a tree?  So that's a big, that's a big, exact match one, which is fine.  But let's say that you're like, I'm getting a lot of like, how  much or cost and I don't want my ads running to that. I want to  run that for SEO or whatever. You can just type what you just  did for how to you can do how much, how much you can do the  phrase cost, you could do free, you could do DIY, you could do  cheap, you can do whatever. And you could add those in the  negative keyword list. And you could be that would be a valuable  possible, that's a way to manage it. So if you go to search terms,  and you're like, I don't want that one, I don't want that one,  but oh, god, I'm seeing a lot of free or I'm seeing a lot of how  to or I'm seeing a lot of like, whatever Home Depot or Lowe's  or something, you could just type that you what I like to do  when I do that is I like to get it, I just, I'm kind of old. So  I'll just have a pad of paper next to me. And I'll just write  it down. And I'll just write down those like little one or  two word phrases. And then when I just add them, and then that  way, I don't have to go through every single search term and  decide if I want to click it. Because when I do that, it's  just an exact match. So but if I'm like, well, how to is coming  up a lot. So I'll just put how to and now I'm going to  eliminate all of the how tos that can come up in the future.  Oh, god. Okay. Yeah, gold, man. Thank you so much. That gives me  some homework to do this next week.  Yeah, and it's something that we go over. We've gone over a  bunch of office hours, still trying to get a lot of these  loaded into the training for you guys. And I know they're trying  to work on a 3.0. And I think it's just kind of getting the  videos done. But also, I think they might be moving to a  different platform. And there's a whole security. So we're just  in the background, we're trying to like, make sure that that  stuff's good. So it might just take a little bit longer. But a  lot of these things will come out eventually and be better able  for you guys to find.  So yeah, and I don't I",

Yeah, I'm that that'll be the my first  first upgrade. So thanks, man. I gotta get to work.  No problem. All right. Take care. All right. Hi, Cindy. How  are you doing?  Hey, Jeff. I'm good. How are you?  I'm great.  That was helpful already. I've been watching a lot of your  videos. So I don't I don't have a specific question. Like, I  have the answer. But I went into like a medium competitive market.  Okay, as we had a business owner for that market, right. So my  goal is to be number two there. And when I started the ads, it  was great. Like the first, I don't know, three, four days, we  probably got three, four leads for this. And now it's been like  three weeks, and it's been like completely dead. So I changed a  couple things, like, I first I set up some ads in like the  neighboring areas that were less competitive, which is okay, like,  they're kind of new. So I haven't seen much from that yet.  And they're smaller populations.  So let me stop it. So you expanded your ad area out.  I actually set up whole new ad in another city.  Okay. Yeah.  Under under a different ad, whole different separate ad or  under the same campaign,  completely separate ad campaign.  Gotcha. Okay.  Yes. And then, and then Google got to me, because they were  calling trying to tell me to switch to conversions and ad had  been up for two, three weeks. And I thought, okay, maybe since  it's not producing, I'll give that a try. So I know, I've  watched a lot of your videos this weekend, never listen to  Google. So I need to undo this. So I did, I switched to  conversions on the main ad. And the next day immediately got like  a call. So I was like, oh, maybe this is good. The call costs a  lot of money, obviously. And they will maximize, they will  maximize the crap out of your budget when",

But should I just  we might be able to salvage it if you can. You can share your  screen if you want. And then we can. Sure. Yeah.  Where do I go to? Oh, I see. I see. Yeah, I see at the bottom  of the window.  I see open system settings.  Should just hit share and then yeah.  You can't see it yet, right?  Nope.  Oh, I think I had to give okay to Chrome.  That's okay. Yeah, there's like sometimes you even have to like  restart it and all that. So if you do just I'll be here if you  if you need to, it gives you a warning.  Yeah, it's saying quit and reopen. Yeah, that's fine. Go  ahead and do that. And I'll still be here. I'll wait. I'll give  you 90 seconds. Okay, thanks. All right. Okay. All right. Let's  see here.

Hey, yeah. Oh, okay. This is  you. I'm talking to you. So let me get me to get rid of the  other one. I have you twice. If this gets rid of you. I'm sorry.  Hang on. If he gets gets rid of you, come back. No, you're good.  Okay. Still here. Yes. Okay. Good deal. All right. You had two  different views up there. I'm like, wait a second. That's  okay. That's just because you restarted. It's all good. So I  think it's working now. All right. Green share. Can you see  my screen now?  Yes.  Okay, so yeah, can you see that there?  OK, so yeah, can you see that there?  Yes.  So I've only got one keyword here for some reason.  My negative ones are there.  Hang on, go back to search keywords.  Go back to that.  OK, you have four filters turned on.  I do?  Yeah, so hit the three more.  Do you see where it's at?  Right there, see what you got turned on.  Just hit X and see if you can get rid of those.  No, OK.  OK, go to where the little martini glass is.  It has the number four on it.  So you have it turned on to only show concrete point.  OK, how do I turn that off?  You should be able to.  You should be able to where you're at,  but it's not showing you that.  Go ahead and click the ad group thing.  See what that does.  Here?  No, no, no, where it gave you that.

Is it okay to have it a bit higher  if it's like a little bit more?  I like to do a penny higher than what I see.  That's my normal plan.  Yeah, it's a penny higher than the highest.  The top of the pitch.  Okay.  Yeah, I'm gonna go back and check that out later.  Okay.  And then I don't know, just in general,  do you think like,  should I just focus on targeting the neighboring areas  that are smaller and see how that goes,  or just spend more of the budget on the main guy  and shoot to rank number two?  I don't know.  So I guess what I'm trying to understand is like,  you have an ad set up in your main area,  and then you set up, is it separate ad groups,  or is it like completely separate ad campaigns  to those other areas?  Completely different campaigns.  Different websites, the whole thing?  Yeah, one website that's more specific to like,  just DriveWife, and the other is general,  but just to a landing page,  because we possibly had another business owner,  they both wanted the same area.  So it was like, I'm gonna keep them separate,  and then just in case like the, you know,  BO number one doesn't want three areas,  and maybe they're all producing leads,  then I have someone else, right?  Yeah, you can do that.  Okay.  I mean, if you're running,  so you're running like three different ads,  as long as you've done the math and they're all like,  set up to optimize in those areas, you should be fine.  I would just try to limit any overlap.  That's probably the biggest thing.  You don't want your ads competing with themselves.  And I think they are.

So that, but maybe those are still gonna compete  with the other people advertising in the main city.  I get, do you wanna look at your locations?  Maybe we can see where you're overlapping possibly.  Okay.  So this one's Lakeland,  and I think I have a radius set up.  Unless I changed that.  No, I do.  You can still see my page, right?  Yeah, so I've got, looks like 13 miles around Lakeland.  Do you wanna see the actual map if I click on it?  Okay, so are you writing a call only ad as well?  So, no, I shut it off immediately.  Okay, no problem.  Yeah, okay.  Yeah, after you posted on, I had posted,  and you commented that you weren't a fan,  so I shut it off.  Yeah, when we were, that video is from when we were going  from what were smart campaigns to this expert mode,  and at the time, like everyone was like,  at the time, like everyone in the group,  it wasn't as many people, but at the time,  everyone had been trained like a really specific way,  and it was very, it was a lot easier.  And now we're jumping into like the big boy,  big girl territory of the expert.  There's no like medium area for Google ads.  So when we taught, it's like, hey,  like call only is the easiest one to teach people  because it's a lot more simple.  So yeah, I kind of wish maybe we didn't do that  because it creates confusion, but it is an option.  It does work, but it works for like immediate,  like I need help yesterday, or large areas  where there's not a lot of competition type of thing.  So, but anyhow, it's okay.  All right, and one of those, like when you're trying  to figure out what's the best way to roll something out,  and later you're like, it probably wasn't  maybe the best moment.  No, it was fine, the business owner wanted calls.  He's like, I don't like the forms, I want calls.  So I was like, okay, but.  Some people are weird with that.  I don't understand that.  It's like, I don't want to have money.  I think when I replied back to you,  it's just, I find that a lot of them,  they just like, I don't check my emails.  And I'm like, okay.  So I just sent them a text and they're like, thank you.  That's easy.  I'm like, cool.  Yeah, I think that's what it is.  By the time you get there, they're not answering the phone.  And I just got a call earlier.  Yeah, and some of them, I will say this,  over the years, I mean, sometimes there's people  that are just really, really busy  and their hands are dirty all day and they're like,  I'm not getting on the phone, I'm busy.  So sometimes that's like, okay, cool.  Well, who else would you trust to get this  and do these calls?  So sometimes it's their spouse.  Sometimes it's like, some of them might make  some of them more legit guys and gals may have an office  and they have somebody",

And then that sometimes helps because  I have a couple of contractors that are clients of mine  and they don't even wanna be bothered with it.  So it goes to, one of them has an assistant that does it  and the other one has a sales manager.  And so I just funnel things that way  and it works great for their business.  And because the owner is at a place where they're like,  I don't even wanna deal with that.  I have people for that.  So it's more of like, okay, who do I need to point it to?  So, yeah.  Yeah, we've got to dig a little deeper on that  because like he answers the phone.  Like if it rings, he's picking up and so he's doable.  Maybe, yeah, maybe we can, someone had suggested,  I think it was Jason suggested maybe we can like  add on the service where a form comes in  and then we call them.  So now we give them the lead over the phone if they answer.  So now-  Yeah, you can do that.  It just becomes, it's good to do that to get a deal.  But it's something that you can like have  as an additional cost, additional service costs to people  because it's gonna cost you.  But like just think about long-term scalability of that.  It's not, yeah.  It's not.  It is, I mean it is, but you have to hire somebody  at some point to manage that.  Yeah, exactly.  I get it.  So, okay.  So, yeah, so-  Okay, so the areas.  So areas, yeah.  What do I show you?  Do you want to see like the map?  Well, are you running both Lakeland  and 13 miles around Lakeland?  Yes, because I think I had-  Are one of them turned off?  No, no, they're both on.  I think I added the radius after when it went quiet  because I thought I needed to expand.  What's the population of Lakeland?  Show me Lakeland on a map real quick, if you don't mind.  I'm kind of familiar with it, but I'm like-  I think it's 200.  There we go.  Yeah.  Okay, what is that to the left?  That looks like a metro area to the left there.  What is that?  Not Plant City.  What's more like towards Brandon, Bloomingdale?  What is, what's that?  Beyond that, it's Tampa.  Tampa's over there.  Tampa.  What's the distance, do directions  between Lakeland and Tampa?  How many miles is that?  See on the left, you can just do directions.  See right there?  Probably like 40 minutes.  Yeah, how do I, okay.  Yeah, and just do that to like Tampa.  I think it's like 40 minute drive.  Oh, I'm right on, there we go.  40 minutes, 35 miles, okay, cool.  All right, and then Winterhaven  is a suburb of Orlando, right?  And Winterhaven is very close.  It's like immediately to the right of Lakeland.  And that's actually where my business owner is.

Yeah, so, okay, so when you go,  so 13 miles outside of Lakeland  is picking up Winterhaven and all these up,  so you're, by blowing your ad out more  than just those city limits right there that we see,  you're running your ads to all of those other people  in that region.  So you could be at, so that will,  that, if you don't adjust your budget for that,  that's an easy way to like sabotage yourself.  Okay, so maybe that was my-  Yeah, yeah, so it's not that you can't run outside,  you just have to just make sure that you understand,  like in some areas where like Tennessee's a great example  of a state where like you'll have a city  of like 50, 60,000 people and that's like the big city,  that's the town, the grocery store, all that,  then you have this rural area around it  for like 10 miles, 15 miles,  and there's like a couple thousand here, five, eight, 10,  there's not like 100,000 population  somewhere next to that city.  That's where like that rules,  ruralness works for you to do that.  But in areas like Florida, California, New York,  except unless you're like way upstate New York,  those are areas where like there's so many damn people  that you just have to be really mindful of  when I just throw out a radius to throw out a radius.  I think like North Carolina and Georgia are like that too,  because they're just not that big territorial wise,  so when you throw out a map like that,  you could easily like double the population  without realizing that you just doubled the population.  So is that, is it bad though if I'm maximizing the clicks?  Like if my target is the biggest city there,  which is Lakeland, and then when I throw the radius,  like it increases population,  because yes, it's adding the smaller towns,  versus, so the other campaigns I set up  were like Winterhaven and Poinciana,  which is even more East, and I didn't put the radius,  at least not at first,  because I didn't want that to count Lakeland,  but then it was small, I don't think I got any hits.  Right, some of that is probably because like  when you expanded that Lakeland one,  you probably didn't increase your daily budget, right?  I did a little bit, but like not enough to.  Yeah, you just need to do, you just wanna look at,  like if you go to the map and look at that radius,  if you wanna go back to where the locations are.  Sure.  And then that, yeah, show that spot where the road,  where the radius goes, not there on the ads, yep.  Yeah, let's see what that looks like.  Okay, let's zoom in",

    "pageContent": "on that and let's look at, so, okay.  If I was to overlay that map with zip codes of that area,  okay, so I want you to imagine that,  that line, that 13 mile radius line,  that's not like, that doesn't like cut through a street.  If whatever zip code that's touching,  you're running ads to that, a whole zip code.  Yeah, it's pretty big.  So you're actually, yeah,  so you're including more people than you realize,  because you probably are kind of touching a zip code  possibly related to Tampa, maybe not.  You're definitely running ads to pretty much  all of Winterhaven, probably all of Lake Alford.  Like, does that make sense?  So like, even though we think, oh, okay, it's not,  that line is not like a definitive line.  Any zip code that line touches,  you're running ads to that whole zip code.  Okay, so yeah, so if you were,  if you were gonna target this area then,  so just knock out the radius and let it run,  or together, like, should I just forget Lakeland  and just go Winterhaven without the radius,  Auburndale, Lake Alford, like just pick up the smaller guys?  On my other-  It seems like you have like another ad for,  you said a whole other ad for Winterhaven and other areas.  So you can run like individual ads.  If you just wanna pick up like around Lakeland,  there's that, there's a little city to the south  and there's a little one to the southeast.  Like, you can just add those cities into it  and you'll see the map just kind of grab that city limit  and grab the other city limit.  That's a way to better control that just random radius.  And, but keep it all in one ad.  So you wouldn't exclude Lakeland,  Lakeland because it's kind of competitive?  Like I'm-  I'm not afraid to, 200,000 is not that big of a deal to me.  That's a good sweet spot, uh-huh.  Okay.  It's just that outside of that area,  there's like bigger cities  or cities that even have a hundred thousand people in it.  So that's where you go, ooh, okay.  That could get really expensive really fast.  Cause now I'm running my ad to 400,000 people  or 500,000 people, which isn't terrible,  but I have to make sure my daily budget  and my bids and everything else are aligned  to be successful to run ads to that many people.  Right, okay.  Okay, thank you, yeah.  We need to put it all into one ad because yeah,  it doesn't make sense to have three campaigns going.  I was like just trying to test it out,  but now my budget is all over the place  and it's getting complicated, so.  Yeah, the only thing with that is like you'll have your,  like Winter Haven's its own little spot  and it's got a decent enough population  that like maybe they're not,  they may not respond to a Lakeland concrete site.  Right. Maybe they will.  So that's something, it's not that you can't do that,  it's just a thing to think about.  Okay, yeah.  I would just run numbers, run numbers for both cities.  That'll, the data directs me.  So like if there's good population, good data,  I can make some ads, there's competition.  Like I might just set up a Winter Haven concrete site ",

Appreciate your help.  All right, good luck.  Thank you, bye.  Bye.  All right.  Let's see here.  Okay, Boya, I'm gonna,  remind me how to pronounce your name again.  I'm sorry.  Hi, ladies.  Ladies, okay.  Did I say that right?  Yes.  I was like, there's like four ways to say that.  I don't even wanna attempt to blurt it out.  It's fine, it doesn't matter.  That's okay.  All right.  And you were having issues with your,  trying to set up your conversions, right?  Yeah, so I'm new.  This is the first time I'm gonna set up a campaign.  Nice.  Managers accounts.  And I also have a Google account.  Okay.  I don't think the Google account,  it's not a sub account, it's just a Google account.  So I tried to set up a sub account  under my managers accounts.  Yeah.  And I noticed that the questions that I get to set it up  are different than the ones explained in the training.  So I was like a little bit lost.  I didn't know.  Yeah.  So maybe I can share my screen.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, let's do that.  Yeah, and there's been some changes.  And that's why I asked you if you can hop on  because there's people that are,  I've been getting more and more of these same questions.  So what, I think I said it last week too,  is like what I suspect is happening  is that Google is rolling out a new interface for people  and maybe a new setup,  but it hasn't fully flipped across the board  because I just set up seven new ads this week.  I didn't run across what you're talking about at all.  So it's like, okay.  So it just maybe hasn't hit my interface yet.  So, and these are like normal things that happens.  Like it's not a huge issue.  So, okay.  Do you see my screen?  I do.  Okay.  So the first, the initial problem I had like disappeared.  I don't know what happened.  So my initial problem was that it showed a screen  where I had to enter like a sub page.  I had to choose, first I had to choose  the goal of my campaign.  And I chose views, page views, like you told me to.  It asked me to enter a sub page.  I sent you a screenshot.  You have like everything turned on though.  It looks like YouTube, Gmail, search, display, discover.  Like we don't want any of those.  We just want search.  Okay.  So, all right.  Let me...  Can we go back to the beginning?  Yeah.  Just say discard.  Yeah.  All right.  So I'm in my,  I'm in my...  This is a regular Google account.  Manager's account.  Yeah.  I'm in my manager's account.  Okay.

Oh, so this is,  this is my sub account that I made.  Mm-hmm.  Hold on one second.  Okay.  Okay.  All right.  Let's do this just because...  Okay.  This is a manager account and that's fine.  There has been some changes to the MCC stuff.  You would, since you don't have an ad already,  let's go to the one above that, that 931.  Let's just start with a regular Google ads account  because what?  There's this like thousand dollar limit  that's really weird that Google's done.  So, okay.  Is this the account that you're asking questions about  or this is a sub account?  No, so this is, this is just a,  now I'm in my Google accounts.  Yeah.  This is regular Google ad account.  This is, this is fine.  This is a regular Google ad account.  All right.  So I don't need to make a sub account.  I just go straight to make a campaign.  Well, we can, well, not here.  This is, this was a campaign you already set up  and it looks like it got suspended.  Where does it say?  Oh no, you know, you remember that I,  that I know that's another camp.  You remember a couple of weeks ago  that I asked you how to see the exact search volume  and you helped me set up a campaign,  just like a fake campaign.  That's the one.  Okay.  Oh, that's the fake one.  But it's unsuspended, it's already unsuspended.  Okay.  All right.  Okay.  Okay.  So in this account, you have something happening.  You have a campaign, right?  So this is its own individual account.  Under the MCC, this would be considered a sub account.  This is just a Google ad account.  But this is not a sub account, right?  Okay.  This is a regular Google ad account.  Okay.  This is the same thing as a sub account  and a manager account.  Okay.  All right.  So as far as like the setup and all that stuff.  Okay.  What's happening in the, with the MCCs,  the manager accounts is like,  they're limiting how many ads you can create,  how many sub accounts you can create up right,  you can create right now until you hit a thousand dollars  and another, another account under the Gmail.  Okay.  So what you'll wanna do is you're gonna,  so for like your first, say five, six, seven ads,  you're just gonna wanna set up individual Google ad accounts  and then you can bring them by invitation  under the MCC to be managed.  Is that necessary or no?  You don't have to, but at some point you'll hit like,  I can't remember if it's 14 or 17.  You can set up like 14 or 17,  like Google ad accounts under one Gmail  before you have to have another one.  Yeah. Okay.  But I'm not there yet.  So. No.  So",

So we're just, this is the best way to adapt.  It's one of those things we've covered on office hours.  I've asked for it to be put into the training for you guys.  So I'm just still waiting for it to get uploaded  for you guys, cause I know it's something that's changed.  I think like you weren't, I don't think you were on yet,  but I've been where I know they're in the works  of getting the 3.0 stuff done and dialed in,  but I know there's been some like security issues  and other things like that.  They're trying to like work out.  So can I ask you something?  Yes.  So how many campaigns can I make  under this one Google accounts?  It's like, I can't remember the exact number.  Well, okay.  Under this one, one.  Okay.  One to one website.  So you can set up different campaigns  as long as it's going to the same website.  So let's say that you're doing like,  I don't know which one this is,  but let's say this is a tree one and you're like,  well, I really want to focus on like a tree trimming,  like whatever.  And then I want to do tree removal or whatever.  You can set up different campaigns to the same website,  but you don't want to set up a new campaign  to a different website under this one.  You would create a whole new Google's ad account for that.  Okay.  So only in case, for example,  I want to expand my ad to neighboring areas.  Yeah, you can set up a-  And I need the same websites.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And otherwise I have to make a new Google accounts.  Yeah, and that's easy.  You just go to where your icon is, the A,  and then you just go to set up new Google ads account.  Okay.  Yeah.  If you have a full website,  the other thing is if you have a full website,  let's say you want to go to like your neighborhood  to the right, to the east of wherever,  you can just make a landing page.  So let's say that I have like Jeff's Tree Service  and I have like my main location is like Farmington,  whatever.  And then I want to go to like,  I want to run ads and like, you know,  Gold Beach or something.  I just set up a landing page that'll say  Gold Beach tree trimming services or whatever.  And I just run my targeted, you know,  if I want to target Gold Beach community,  I set up a landing page and I just run my ads that way.  You can set that up under here if you want to,  as long as it all falls under the same big website.  Does that make sense?  So if I have a proper website  and I make an extra landing page  for the same niche but a different area.  Yeah.  I can do it.  I wouldn't be like, I wouldn't run my like,  I wouldn't jump off the bat and run like one in one state  and one in another state.  Cause that would be weird.  But if it's like, if I'm in Farmington,  I don't know where Farmington is, I'm just making it up.  And Gold Beach is the community right next to it.  That would make",

Can I just talk with you,  if I start making a campaign that it looks,  I suppose it's going to look more or less the same  than what you explained in the training,  but I'm not really sure.  I think it has to do with the fact that my,  my location is, I think my location.  Yeah.  I think the last time that, I think that's an issue.  Yeah.  I don't know about, it was the manager's account.  I don't know about his Google accounts.  Right.  I think there's a,  I really think that there is a,  there's an interface issue with what you guys have out there.  Like when I go here, like if I click website traffic,  and it's asking you, like it's,  I'm sorry.  It pains in the butt.  Like, okay, like here,  it's asking you to like run a tag on your website  and do all that.  I just hit continue.  And then what is it asking?  The one action, I just leave it?  Yeah.  It just means, you're just telling it like,  yeah, I hear you.  I'm just going to ignore you.  Okay. Okay.  And then you go down to select your campaign  and it's typically search, right?  That's what we want to run.  That's what we want to run.  And then you hit continue.  Just hit continue.  Okay. Don't enter my website.  You can name it if you want, whatever.  It could be a tree tree or whatever it is,  whatever you want to name it that you remember.  Concrete.  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay. So this is all,  these are all the same steps that you encounter as well.

I mean, I don't have the data.  Let's put it in.  I mean, what do you mean with data?  I mean, I have the CPC that is the minimum  and the maximum that is mentioned in the Google ads.  What's the maximum CPC that you saw for this campaign?  The maximum was 1538.  Okay. So I would put my max CPC at 1539.  Okay.  Is that a period or a comma?  Sorry, I can't tell on my end.  It's a comma.  Okay.  So this is, I just leave it like that?  Okay. Yeah.  You see here, I have to change.  Okay. I know. I hear you.  Hang on.  We want to get rid of the search partners  then display network.  They're always going to auto fill that.  We always remove it.  Both. Okay.  Okay.  Now we go to look, enter another location, right?

This is it asking you  if you want to just let them kind of run your,  like, this is like allowing AI Gemini to,  that's Google's AI is Gemini,  to let them like set everything up.  That's your headlines, your description,  instead of how we have it.  I'm like, I'm not convinced yet,  but I'm not like, I don't hate it either.  So I'm still trying to figure it out.  So this is that where if you want to put your URL in,  you can put it in and it might help you generate  a bunch of headlines and keywords and all that,  or you can hit skip and just do it manually.  So it's your call.  I'm going to try.  Yeah.  Okay.  So you, you've done it before.  What makes your product service unique?  So I have to-  Oh, interesting.  All the ones I do, it actually pulls it in.  So what you can do is go back to your homepage,  your one pager.  Yeah.  Yeah, go to your one pager.  Let's go down to what, what's your intro paragraph?  Let's just see what that looks like.  Right. And then just copy that,  like just copy and paste that into the description  and see what it does.  Yeah.  Like a part of it or how much should I-  Just the whole thing.  Just the whole opening paragraph.  Right there.  Yep. Just that.  There you go.  Copy that and then paste that in there.  Let's see what it does.  Hit generate.  And again, I don't know if this is like  going to be awesome all the time,  but it is something I'm kind of like interesting.  Now I'm not,  I don't really trust them on all of their keywords.  I don't know if that's going to be up to you  to set your own keywords,  set them up as phrase match.  These are set up as broad match right now,  but like, but we can, like we can just,  let's just leave them for right now.  You can do this later and then go down.  Right.  Okay. Just a question here.  Yeah.  Enter products or services to advertise.  We don't have any that we're running services.  Yeah. You can leave it blank.  And then another question about the keywords.  So the, the keyword that is in,  that's having the most searches  is concrete companies near me.  I don't see, so I can add it.  Yeah. Okay.  Is there a difference between the, for example,  concrete companies and concrete companies near me?  Is the near me making a difference?  Yeah. Yeah.  I talked about this with the first person today.  So like, this is where,  like no one types in concrete companies near me  or concrete contractors near me, right?  Google auto fills that for us.

I might type in sushi  and it's going to auto-populate near me.  And I'm going to be like, yeah, near me.  I want that.  I want to know what's near me, right?  Yeah. So, yeah.  Okay.

And then now let's scroll down  and let's see what it filled in for you.  Keep going, keep going.  Oh, it didn't fill in any headlines for you.  Really interesting.  Okay. What I think this is,  is because it's a, because it's a one pager,  it's recognizing Weebly.com.  I bet you that's wrong, which isn't a big deal.  It just means we just manually have to do it.  So the AI may not be working for you guys right now  because you're using Weebly.com, right?  So much is fine.  AI is not that smart yet.  But I mean, this kind of sets you up,  concrete contractors, concrete company,  like you just, this is where you got to go back  through the training and nail those things down.  So then once you're here, you just kind of set it up.  You just follow the training from here.  But you can see how it didn't take us through  any of those other steps that you were asking about earlier.  And even that one with the page view, I just ignore it.  Okay, fine, great.  I'm gonna ignore you.  All that is, is a tracking mechanism.  The problem was I couldn't ignore it.  I couldn't skip, I couldn't continue.  I know, but I also, when I looked at it,  you were trying to run ads  to like five different Google platforms.  So I think something happened in the setup,  which is probably why it directed you to say,  no, I need this, I need this, I need this.  And you're like, I don't have it.  Well, it's because you're probably,  just like when you went in  and it auto-populated display and partners,  it's an easy one to forget, but that's most likely why.  So.  Okay, can I just, or as I go back to the keywords,  that were mentioned, like automatically by AI.  Yeah, I don't really trust them,  but you can just trust and verify.  Just, you can look at them, but.  Does it make a difference?  I mean, do I need to be very, does it make a difference  that there's like five keywords generated automatically  and I don't think they're gonna show up?  I am not, I have not been a fan of any of the keywords  that the AI has recommended to me.  I just delete them.  I'm the expert.  I know I've done my own research.  I looked at the Google keyword data.  That's the stuff that I'm gonna do.  Yeah, okay.  What I was saying is",

So it's like, yep, I'm gonna use that one.  I'm gonna use that one.  Nope, nope, nope.  Yes, yes, yes, no, no, no.  So I call that trust but verify.  So just look at them.  If they look good, yeah, oh cool.  I was gonna run that ad anyways.  Great, if not, I'm out and you're out.  You just make your own like you should, right?  All right.  When is the next time that you're gonna be online  just in case that I have?  Good question.  Let me see.  What does next week look like?  Tuesday'd be cool, but I know Nick goes on Tuesday mornings.  So let's see, it'll probably be Thursday the 27th.  I typically try to come on between 10 and 10.30 a.m.  my time if I'm here in Los Angeles.  So that works for me.  Okay, all right.  Thank you.  Yeah, you're very welcome.  Bye-bye.  Bye, take care.  All right.  Let's see here.  Hello, Jeff.  Hi, how's it going?  I'm good, I'm good.  So yeah, I'm from, I'm in Australia.  Okay.  Yeah, I just, I mean, I don't think I have,  there's no issues yet, but I just want to make sure  whether I'm just on the, that I'm not doing anything wrong.  So I'll just quickly share my screen  because what's happened is, where's the share button?  Yeah.  Best of three.  So in my, you know, the normal Google account,  so once again, just press the share button.  Is it even sharing?  It's not yet.  I'm not seeing it yet.  Yeah, because I'm just clicking the share button,  but it's not seems to go.  Okay, I don't know what's going on.  I'll just explain it.  In the normal Google account, I've spent more than $1,000.  Okay.  And now I have to pause the ad  because my client here, she has gone on a holiday.  So, but she is just going to start when she comes back.  She's gone on a three week holiday.  So the crew is not, they're not working.  It's in the tree service space.  Now that I, since I've crossed $1,000,  I've gone back to my MCC account  and added this account as a sub account.  Now I need to, when I try, like what I don't know  is I'm also doing a due diligence on another",

In terms of like, when I try to look at, okay,  just to see if I've got everything,  it says I can't add like the payment or stuff  seems to be there.  Because I'm just not sure if my,  if I can link the same credit card to my MCC account,  like this, like how I've done for the other account.  And do you think the card's be there?  Yeah.  Yeah, I have all of them set up on all of the same,  either PayPal or credit card right now.  When I have, I have multiple MCCs.  I have, they're under multiple emails or multiple gmails.  Like I very rarely, once in a while I get a problem,  but for the most part, it's like, hey, what are you doing?  I just hit it.  I just send an appeal and it gets appealed.  So yeah, I haven't really had any issues.  Okay, cool.  I'll just try it and see what happens.  I was just, it was slightly fearful  the fact that it might ban me or suspend me or something.  So I just didn't want that.  You know, if it does, it's typically,  it's typically just because like it,  it happens so fast and it like,  it might trigger just an auto like,  oh, something's happening.  So your bank and everyone just hits stop.  And you just, typically those are easy ones.  You just appeal and it comes back within a day or two.  So typically that's what I see is that.  And that's it.  That is like, I mean, that could happen to me at the store.  You know, it's like, those aren't really big issues.  It's like, I get a notification.  Hey, are you using your card?  You're like, yeah, that's me.  Okay, your card's fine.  Go ahead and use it again.  It's kind of the same thing.  I wouldn't be too worried about it.  Yeah.  All right.  Okay.  Yeah.  And generally with, when the client comes and says,  I will go with chatting shop,  we're going for three weeks holiday.  I mean, my initial reaction was, yeah, of course,  if you can't earn money, how can you pay me?  So we'll pause it.  I mean, I just said, I'll just stop sending leads to you.  I didn't say all the other details.  I mean, usually like, you know, if I'm doing this,  if I'm earning money through this and that's my only,  like, do you just say, yes, I'll accommodate that?  Like generally for people.  Have you had an instance like this  where they've gone on holiday and you had to just stop it?  Yeah.  Yes, I've had, I've had, yeah, I've had, you know,  you know, deaths in the family, you know, recently,  like fires, like someone lost their home.  I had a guy who like, you know,  not saying this in a political stance,  but like in our country, my country, like, you know,  we're, they're like mass deporting a lot of people  that are like undocumented workers and my friends.

Like I've had people now for like four or five years  that are awesome.  You know, so it's like, it just kind of depends.  If it's like the very beginning  and they're kind of like, kind of a difficult client,  I'd be like, I'm just going to find, like, you know what?  I got three weeks to find somebody new.  Yeah.  Like I'm firing you, you're just not worth it.  But if they're a really good client and it's whatever,  I got you.  I got you.  I'll see you when you get back.  Okay.  Yeah.  Does that help?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean, with this client, it's still early on.  Like they've been with me for a month, solid.  Yeah.  So, but it's, and they just, and she didn't mention it  even before I engaged, I brought her on  that they might be going on holiday in late February, so.  So it's not like a surprise or a shout out.  Yeah.  No, no, no.  So, yeah.  I just, see how it goes, so, yeah.  All good.  Thanks.  Thanks for the word.  Unless you're getting, oh, you're welcome.  Unless you're getting like a weird vibe from them,  it sounds like they were very upfront with you.  So what I will say to that is like,  what we should be charging these people  is not all Google ad spend.  So if you think this is going to be successful,  whether with this business owner or there's others  that are potentially out there, like, you know,  in the future, I would be more like maybe,  because you're trying to do SEO as well.  Yes.  You're like, I will say that,  kind of thinking of something similar  to what you're talking about,  like I've reduced my monthly fee for people,  but I'm still going to have you pay me while you're gone,  because I'm still doing work on yours.  I'm still doing things.  Now, if it's the very, very beginning  and you haven't fully moved into building a full website yet,  and you're pretty much just running Google ads only,  then maybe you could be like, all right,  I'm just going to be cool about it.  I'm not going to be a jerk.  But like, as time goes on, let's say this,  let's say you're with this client,  this time comes around next year,  and they're like, hey, I'm going on.  You're like, that's cool, I got you.  I'll tell you what, for the next month,  I'll just reduce half your fee for this month  while you're gone.  That allows me to still work and do this stuff  on your behalf while you're gone.  But I'll turn off some of the paid stuff  I have going da-da-da-da-da.  And basically you're telling them like,  I'll give that savings to you.  Like enjoy a beer while you're out on me type of thing.  And then, so that's setting up a good tone.  And it's not like, right?  Because we're not just running Google ads.  Like your goal, the main play is SEO.  Exactly.  Okay.  So in the very beginning, I",

You have more questions?  I stayed.  Yeah, I sent you a message.  Yeah, just, I'm new to this.  What I still try to understand with the Google ads  is I did the training with Shift before.  They don't work with Google ads, so this is new to me.  What I'm still trying to understand is  how come that we can spend less money on Google ads  than the business owner?  Because we're focusing on business owners  that are running Google ads.  So the sales argument that you're gonna have  is you're gonna be better off with me  than keep on running your own ads,  or I'm gonna send you,  or is it just I'm gonna send you extra clients  on top of your own Google ads?  I don't really understand yet what the...  Okay.  Have you had that objection yet,  or are you just thinking about it?  I'm not there yet.  I haven't had a business owner yet.  Okay, so, all right.  So I would say don't get too worried about things  that maybe haven't happened yet, right?  And just think of it like this.  If I was, I think you mentioned tree trimming.  Let's say that I had my own tree trimming company,  and I have my own website, I'm running my own Google ads,  I'm doing my own SEO, and I'm killing it.  Am I gonna talk to you?  I'm probably not.  No.  Right, unless I'm like, hey, yeah, you know what?  I'm doing really well here,  but I don't have enough time to go over here.  Do you have anything in this area?  No, I know.  The business owners, for example,  that I'm now listing, they have a Google ads,  but they have a website on page 10, or something.  But what I'm saying is if I'm running Google ads  and I'm successfully doing it,  I'm not going to talk to you, typically,  because I'm doing it fine.  Why am I gonna pay you for something  I'm having success with?  So you mean, okay, so you mean-  It's the people that are running ads  or paying some shit company, some shit agency, SEO,  and they're like, yeah, I'm not getting results  for these people at all.  Those are the people we end up selling to.  Okay, okay, got it.  It's not the people, the people that are doing it  and are successful and are kicking butt,  they're probably not even gonna answer the phone.  And if they are, it's probably gonna be like,  oh yeah, yeah, I already did that, I don't have,  I'm good, I already did a click.  Unless that person's like,  actually, I wanna expand to this area,  but I don't have the time.  Like, yeah, if you can do something for that,  we can do business.  Because that business owner understands it already.  You're already pre-sold.  So if they want something from you or",

But the business owner that's comfortable  with where they're at, they're not gonna talk to you.  So don't worry about that.  They're not gonna wanna buy your stuff  unless they want to expand.  So I have a guy, I had a guy,  I shouldn't say I have him anymore.  He's since retired, but like, he was,  he did a lot of things,  and he wanted to really focus down on one thing.  And I was like, okay, so I was like his expert  for that like silo, that type of specific service  in his business and his overall business.  And basically what he did is he basically had,  he had a few people internally, and then he had me,  and he had someone else doing some type of like  social media, like retargeting, stuff like that.  And I mean, the guy was probably spending  80 to 90 grand a month.  Like that guy was making millions of dollars,  but he's also spending like 100 grand a month  on marketing his business.  So like that business owner understood it.  He was fine with me coming in and buying the stuff for me.  But those business owners, you might, you'll find them,  but they're not typically who we're gonna sell to.  Yeah, okay, okay.  Typically the guy we're selling to  or the girl we're selling to is the person  that's like, you see, that's why we wanna talk to them  because there's a barrier.  If I'm just a guy who does concrete and you call me  and I'm like, I already have a website.  I don't know that stuff, click.  We're not, good luck.  You have to really convince me it takes a long time.  If I'm like, yeah, I'm trying and I'm getting my butt kicked  or I was paying these guys $5,000  and they're not getting me anything,  and I'm now a frustrated business owner.  The thing about that is like,  when you call me and talk to me,  I'm either having a problem with it  or I'm not.  If I am, I'm gonna talk to you.  And if I'm not having a problem with it,  I'm not gonna spend the time talking to you.  So don't worry about it.  Don't worry about that objection that you have in your head.  Don't worry about it because that person's gonna tell you  no thank you or buzz off or I'm good and click.  What about from your experience with business owners,  do most of them run their Google ads by themselves  or do they hire an external company?  Hmm.  I don't know how it is in the US.  And in my country in Europe,  I would say everybody does it, they don't spend money.  They're gonna do it themselves.  I don't know in the US, the majority of the business owners.  The small guys, yes, it's the same.  I mean, I have a guy who I just picked up that's a,  he's in Austin, okay,  which is like seven and a half million people.  And he had an issue and he went on full panic mode  and blew up his whole business on Google.  Like, I mean, it's like, so when I'm talking to him,  I'm like, you did what?  Like, oh my",

    "pageContent": " What would you do if you happen to have a client in an area where search volume for any keyword is 10?  Only way I was able to make it work was by expanding radius to 30 miles around the city.  Do you just focus on surrounding area service pages? What is the best strategy to rank to  get enough volume? That's going to be a tough one, especially because I don't even know,  like 10 is going to be extremely tough. Biggest thing you're going to have to do is set expectations.  And then I assume because there's only 10 that the city size is not that big,  which means it's probably not super competitive unless it's carpet cleaning,  which means you should be able to build a website in the main city and service page, or sorry,  location pages in the surrounding cities and rank those fairly easily. So picture it like this,  right? Let's use a city like Nashville because it's easy to explain. Although this wouldn't be  the case because these surrounding cities are actually bigger, but just so you guys can picture  this. Let's say that Nashville only had a search volume of 10 for carpet cleaning,  which would never be the case, but let's just say it. Or we can even say something else. We  could say excavation, which again, wouldn't be the case. Nashville is huge, but let's say it did.  And you're like, crap, I need to figure out how to get more leads in some of these outskirts in  Clarksville and excuse me, Murfreesboro in Lebanon and whatever the case is, right?  What's some of the other cities? Why am I having a brain funk here? What's the other one after?  Anyway, it doesn't matter. What I would tell you is that assuming that this city that you're  targeting only has 10 volume, I'm guessing it's not a huge city. And I'm guessing the outskirts  cities are not big either, which means they're probably not competitive. So what I would do is  I would build the site. Let's say it's tree service Nashville. Maybe we should use it as a  different example. Let's use a different example actually, because everyone's going to go and  think this is the case. Let's use something everyone would know. I'll use Salt Lake City.  You guys won't know what that is, but I can explain it to you. So Salt Lake City,  I'm going to pull up a map here to explain this. And you guys can do the same thing.  Type in Salt Lake City and go to a map. And I'm going to show you what I mean.  So if I was trying to do this in Salt Lake City, what I would do is, and let's say Salt Lake City  was only 10, right? The volume was 10 in whatever it is, excavation. What I would do is I'd build  the main website as saltlakecityexcavation.com, whatever. And I would focus tons and tons and  tons of energy on ranking there. Now, what I'd also say, Shane, is that if this deal is not a  guaranteed done deal, I wouldn't mess with it, right? Is this a deal you're pre-selling or  somebody came to you? Because if somebody's coming to me, it's one thing, but I'm not going to go  into a city on my own dime that's only got 10. But let's say somebody did come to you.  What I would do is I'd build the website in that main city that has a search volume of 10.  And then I would have location pages. So it'd be saltlakecityexcavation.com forward slash  bountiful. And in",

That would be like a homepage because you  are going to be ranking that page against everyone else in bountiful that's doing excavation.  Then I'd have another location page would be saltlakecityexcavation.com forward slash west  valley. Now, for those of you that know Salt Lake West Valley is not somewhere I'd build a website  in because it's just not the spot. But just to give you an example, and I mean that because  it's kind of a sketchy city, west valley, you know, west valley, saltlakecityexcavation.com  forward slash west valley. And I have another one that was saltlakecityexcavation.com forward  slash, let me zoom in a little more, we could say West Jordan, Salt Lake City, you know, and  I'm looking at all these little pockets and I'm trying to do research the best that I can. You  could have one forward slash Kearns forward slash Murray forward slash Woods Cross forward slash  North Salt Lake. That's how I would do it to try and, you know, get as many leads as possible. But  again, I wouldn't even go into the city knowing there's only 10 volume unless somebody came to me  and was like, hey, I really need leads in the city because if somebody came to me and said they  just need leads, I would just say, well, what other areas do you cover besides this city?  Because it doesn't have that much volume. I'll do it for you. But can you do other cities? Can  we look at something else? That's what I would do. Okay. Hopefully that made sense.

I don't know if that means live is breaking. Oh, great.  Well, let's just try it.  Let's just try to do it, Zach.  It is what it is. It's it's live, dude.  That's the point. It's supposed to break.  It's at least you guys know, completely polished.  So we're we have four people watching.  If you are on this live right now, I'd love to hear just comment on it.  Just say something. You can say that.  Say, what's up? Say you can hear me just so I know who's on.  The funny thing about YouTube is it's a username.  So we got like Hustler 80.  You got all kinds of different names, but I'll call you guys by your name.  So we're just going to jump in.  I want to get I wanted Zach to get on this call today.  If you guys don't know who I am,  go watch some of the other YouTube videos that we put out.  I've been doing this business model of building simple websites,  ranking them on Google and renting them out for almost nine years.  Lost a bunch of money, made a bunch of money.  But I think it's one of the best business models on the Internet.  OK, I want to bring Zach on  because Zach does things a little bit differently.  Zach is somebody that I started working with like,  I think it was like two and a half years ago.  And he he needed to get out of his job.  He needed to replace the income from his job.  And Zach, at that time, you're making like six thousand gross, right?  After taxes, my job, I'd bring home like forty six hundred.  So, yeah. OK.  So he's making forty six.  The taxes are crazy.  It's making forty six hundred bucks a month.  But he's like, I need to get that replaced as soon as possible  so I can keep building my dream.  And many of you guys are in that same situation  where you want to do digital real estate, you want to do something online,  but you need to get that initial jail be nine to five, whatever it is.  Maybe it's even a business.  It's just not bringing in a lot of money.  You need to get that income replaced so you can then focus on other things  like building digital real estate.  So I want to bring Zach on because I've realized that sometimes people need,  you know, different ways out of the the rat race.  They want to get out.  And I think the best thing you can do as quickly as you can get out  is the method that you should take.  And so Zach has found this really, really interesting way  of of selling simple SEO services  where he has been able to scale.  Zach, are all of your deals, your fifty eight thousand dollars per month,  is that one hundred percent SEO?  I have one lead client.  For five hundred a month, everything else is SEO.  Yeah, that's crazy, bro.  I'll buy it from you.  We'll talk later.  So OK, so fifty seven.  I missed fifty seven thousand five hundred dollars all from selling simple SEO.  And I'm I'm I'm enunciating and I'm putting the emphasis on the simple  because Zach's strategy is very unique when I and the reason  I was a big you guys watched me for a long",

    "pageContent": "time, I was a big hater of SEO  services because I did it wrong and I tried to go land a bunch of big clients.  I had clients cancel on me.  I had this really bad experience and I was like, no, don't do it.  Don't do it.  And then Zach started scaling and I was like, well, obviously  he knows something that I don't.  Let's take a look.  And so we hopped on the phone and I realized, oh, he's doing this very, very differently.  So Zach does this in such a way, guys,  that he doesn't put himself at risk of like losing a bunch of business.  The other thing is he has his team that he's built doing this for him.  And on top of that, he actually has if he were to go in right now today into his.  Let's call it 50.  Let's call it because your deals are smaller.  So you probably have close to 100 clients, right?  Yeah, there's like a hundred and seventy some hundred and seventy.  You do like really small.  So, guys, you've got this business brick by brick, right?  Well, imagine he goes to half of those clients  and pitches them on a lead generation deal.  He's got a ton of money sitting on the table.  And so you can do this in a really strategic way.  Excuse me, that I have never seen done before.  So as a way to just add value to you guys and to show you guys  something a little bit different, I want to bring Zach on, talk about his overall strategy.  And then also the other reason I like talking about this is because SEO  is a part of what we are doing inside of lead generation,  inside of digital real estate, inside of ranking.  We have to rank the website at some point, whether you do it at the beginning  or you do what I do, you sell it and then rank it.  You have to do the ranking part to complete the process.  So Zach just happened to focus on the ranking of other people's websites.  So, Zach, welcome to call, man.  Let's just get into it.  I know you you've got we've got like twenty five minutes  and then you got to hop off.  And I think that's perfect.  So kind of explain to everyone.  High level, what it is that you do, like the type of clients that you have.  And then maybe we can talk about your process from like,  like, again, like a ten thousand foot view.  And then if people, you know, want to check more of your stuff out,  whenever we can let them know.  But just I want to inspire people that there's you can get your life  can change in a matter of 12 months.  And so let's let's just start there and let's talk about  let's talk about what you actually do, your business does.  Yeah, so pretty simple.  I started out actually 100 percent focused on lead gen,  building sites, ranking those sites.  That's why I still have a client like that I've had for years.  And then I realized there was this opportunity  because my dad owns a carpet cleaning company where  I built his website and ranked that well.  And then his friends wanted me to build their websites.  And it was the same skill set.  And I was like, man, I could see the path to quit my job  if I just stacked these easy website builds plus SEO clients.  So that's what I started doing.  I already knew how to build the websites.  I already knew how to rank the sites.  Now, instead of building",

    "pageContent": "my own sites and putting the money into that  to then land the deals later, I would just go  make money day one, which I liked.  I would just go get the deal.  They pay me day one.  Then my team and I build the website and help it rank.  And they just keep paying us every month.  And it was low stress because I would start out, just charge  three hundred to five hundred bucks a month per client  and just stack those clients is easy wins, easy wins, easy wins  until I was able to quit my job quickly.  Like, I started doing that  about four or six months later, quit my job,  and then just grew it a much more from there.  But it's essentially the same concept you talk about all the time.  I just tweaked it where I didn't own the site.  They own the site and they just pay me each month to build it and improve it.  And that's how I got the easy wins  because I needed the fast, easy wins to to quit my job.  And so that's that's the route I took and it's worked really well.  And then from there, you know, build the systems to get more sales faster,  more websites, build faster and just build it up.  So that's kind of the high level overview.  I want to go into questions I know everyone's asking.  Number one, does it worry you?  By the way, I've asked you these questions.  So I know you're going to be like, do I ask this again?  But from somebody that's just hearing you,  does it not worry you that your clients have the control  where they can just cancel at any point?  Why doesn't that worry you or does it worry you?  How are you kind of like hedging your bet against that?  Yeah, that's a great question.  Business owners need a website  and they need someone they can trust.  Most business owners, they're too busy  doing plumbing or electrical work or cleaning carpets.  They don't have the time and they don't want to worry about their online,  their website, their stuff online.  So they know they need a website.  They know they're going to get the website will pay for itself.  And if it ranks better, it's going to weigh more than 10x pay for itself.  As we'll go on Google, people just like when they need their carpet  cleaned, when they need a plumber, they're just going to Google it.  So business owners, they know they need a website.  And they're going to pay someone for that.  So it might as well be me, right?  Very rarely do I lose clients because as long as they're in business,  I've had, I've lost some clients where the guy's like, hey, I'm retiring.  I'm not selling the business.  I'm not, my son doesn't want to take it over.  The business is done.  And it's like, okay, now the website, you know, I lost that client,  but man, that's so rare because people are going to be in business  for five, 10, 15, 20, 30 years, and they need a website.  But it's, it's a pretty solid business model where when you explain things  well, people trust you and they just know like you're their go-to guy.  Um, now for these hundreds of businesses and they're like, oh yeah, it's just  like, it's a monthly expense.  It's like my phone bill.  It's like my TV subscription.  It's like my website.  It's just like, it's just a subscription that",

They're still going to have it up.  And there's, you know, I might give them a reduced package, but they're  still going to be with me because they need that website.  They realize it's critical.  So that's, that's why I like it.  So essentially guys, Zach's using his brain.  He's targeting people who are already planning on and used to spending that money.  Right.  If you've watched any amount of my content on this channel, I always talk  about go after business owners who are already paying for leads.  Why?  Because they don't need to be sold.  You don't need to convince them to spend money on leads.  They already believe in the concept and the idea of spending money on leads.  You just need to show them that your leads, your, uh, services are better  than home advisor angels, whatever.  So Zach, um, explain to everybody, cause you had a very similar experience  as I did doing door-to-door sales, by the way, Zach did door-to-door sales.  He sold a dish network and I wanted to tell you why he stumbled into this  idea of selling to people that were already using the service, but I also  want before he does that before anyone goes, oh my gosh, I, uh, I have  to have sales experience.  That's why these guys are, are no, no, no, no guys.  We, we, we just happened to do door-to-door sales, but we've seen, I  would say at this point over a hundred or hundreds of people that have taken  what we teach and without any sales experience and it made a ton of money.  In fact, um, Zach and I were just barely on a live like an hour ago with somebody  that had zero sales experience.  He's making $44,000 a month.  Did Vinny have any sales experience?  None.  No.  Okay.  So I just want to say that because I know that's what everybody's thinking.  Oh, it's cause they have sales experience.  No, we're, we're the anomaly.  So why should people, why should people target, target, uh, well, not why should  they cause everyone knows that, but what made you decide to start targeting  these kinds of people?  It makes so much sense, dude.  But when I was doing SEO, what I was doing is I was trying to target everybody.  Right.  I was like, well, I know this person has a business.  Let me see if I was pitching these deals where I had to convince them.  They needed, they needed SEO and they needed to use me.  And it was like such an uphill battle.  And then even when you got the deal, the first thing that went wrong, they were  getting ready to cancel the service because they weren't used to paying that bill.  So just tell everyone how you discovered that.  And, uh, I mean, it's genius.  And, and if you're doing it, Legion, if you're doing door to door alarms, door  to door TV, if you're selling SEO, you should freaking follow what Zach's about to say.  Yeah, this is like the golden nugget for me that finally clicked and everything  went buck wild, essentially.  I realized when I was in college and I was selling door to door, um, I was just  getting people to switch from dish network to direct TV or Comcast or AT&T U ",

    "pageContent": "verse, whatever they had, I would just get them to switch.  I never watched TV.  Like I didn't care about TV at all, but I knew that I could rebundle people's  packages or I could switch them over.  And they would go from paying $150 a month to 70.  I would cut their bill in half and they would get the same channels  plus NFL Sunday ticket, right?  And so like they're getting more for half the money.  And it was so easy.  I would just, I would make about 250 or $300 a sale and get like three sales  a day on average as a college student for a hundred days, I ended up making  like 70,000 in three or four months doing this and the whole idea was if  someone didn't have a TV subscription already, I would never make that sale  because you got to sell them on paying 70 bucks a month when they're spending  zero, that's a tough sale, but I could sell people, I would just sell savings.  I would, I would transfer people and save them money all day long.  So then I entered this same thing.  And that's what I figured out, right?  People that are already paying a company, a big marketing company, whoever,  their local dude, they're paying yellow pages, they're paying whatever for their  online presence, their website, they're paying, um, I don't know, Yelp, people  pay, Angelo's people pay for their websites, people pay all sorts of stuff  online, right?  I would just find people who are paying for SEO and give them a better offer for  the same price or a lower price.  And people would just switch to me all day, same concept.  And that's how I built, um, my whole company is just giving people a better  experience.  They're already used to studying the money, but why not get more bang for your  buck and just start paying me instead of these other guys that don't care, don't  know what they're talking about, aren't attentive to the details, don't have good  systems built like, man, I'm just going to serve those people all day long.  And it makes the sales easy and it makes your growth predictable.  You're just like, of course I can add five, 10, 15 new clients a month.  Um, because everyone I talked to wants to do this.  They're already paid just like direct TV.  They're already paying one 50.  They might as well pay 70 and get more with me.  Oh, they're already paying 500.  They might as well pay 500 with me, but get a way better website, a new built,  newly built website.  It's going to rank better.  I'm going to do their Google business profile stuff, which isn't being done.  Like there's going to get a better service than they have for the same price.  It's a no brainer and you just win people over all day long.  So that's how I think about it.  Makes sense.  And it's the same.  I had the same experience.  I won't bore everyone, but I had a very similar experience.  And that's why I always preach and say, target people that are already sold period.  Um, real quick, before we keep going, um, hustler 80 says, Zach is  selling low ticket SEO services.  I thought SEO was around 1500 a month.  Can you clarify if he is selling low ticket to get them to buy more services from you?  So in hustler eighties mind, that's he's never heard of SEO being that cheap.  Can you clarify exactly",

    "pageContent": "what you're offering?  Which, uh, I think is a good question by the way.  Yeah.  Great question.  A lot of people charge way more.  My expenses are lower than those companies because I have international people  working for me, um, which is awesome.  And so our profit margin is insanely high because our costs are low and  we deliver a great service.  But yes, we build websites and do their SEO and their Google business profile  optimization, usually for like around 500 bucks a month, some clients are more if  we're doing additional things and yes, we can then upsell them to, um, other  things that we offer, um, Facebook ads, like we've added other things on over  time, um, but it's those easy wins and then they stay with you forever because  you do a good job and you're like a great price and then you make great  money because you're smart and have international talent that, um, is  phenomenal and not as expensive as, as expensive as us labor.  So great question.  It's a business model that works super, super well because, um, most SEO  companies charging 1500, 2000, 5,000, they see a lot of churn.  I just have a lot less churn.  People are with me for years and years and years.  And I just, I just had a thought, bro.  It's kind of like what's, and this is to answer your question,  um, Hunter or hustler eight.  It's kind of like insurance, right?  So you, I'm sure everyone's act.  Have you ever been pitched on whole life insurance?  Yeah.  Okay.  Everybody has, right?  It's like everyone pitches whole life insurance because the insurance  guys get paid crazy commissions.  Basically whole life insurance.  There's a bunch of perks.  You can, you can take out a loan against it.  You can all kinds of different stuff, right?  There's that, which is what everyone wants to target because they get these  big commissions and these big jobs, whatever.  And Zach's basically the guy that's like, Hey, you guys can go and chase all that.  You guys can go fight over all the whole life insurance deals.  I'm going to go target everyone that has life insurance, just a policy, a term  policy, which is 50, 60, 70 bucks a month.  Why?  Because I know for me personally, I have a policy with Northwestern mutual.  That's like 50 bucks a month.  I've been paying for it since 2018.  I don't touch it.  I don't think about it.  It's just a bill that is, and I will always keep Zach would be the person  would come along and say, Hey, I know you already have term.  Let me show you how I can, you can work with me and it's a better option.  And I've already, I'm used to this bill.  He's not selling me on this additional bill.  He's just targeting people like me that already have term.  He's going for those low ticket, set it and forget it bills that are just a bill.  And he's just figured out a way to use international talent, AKA VA is to go  scrape the internet, find a whole bunch of people that have it go and, and sell  them on using his service, put him into, put them into his system and rinse and  repeat, is that, is that a pretty decent way of describing it or is that my way off?  Yeah, man, you nailed it.  Um, and the other thought there is like, you're building durable",

    "pageContent": "revenue.  That's what I love about this business model is it's a subscription.  Most businesses, service businesses, they got to go out and like earn  the next dollar every day with this.  It's like, you have a recurring client base that trusts you and likes you.  And that creates the foundation, but then, yeah, as you build your company,  you can upsell to other things.  And then it's like, you have no sales cost.  It's like all of a sudden, boom, you upsell them on Facebook ads or on, um,  your CRM system on, you know, whatever you want to offer in the future.  And you have these clients that trust you, you're in the door.  You got that easy win and you can stack that and make an amazing company.  And then if you want to crush it even further, like we're doing is like, cool.  Now these people that trust us, when they ask about whatever, boom, we can fulfill  that need and we grow with those clients and it's pretty phenomenal.  I think the hardest thing is getting the first deal.  That's why there are less entrepreneurs in the world than there could be is  people don't get like that first deal.  And so you want the bar, the barrier of entry in my mind.  I was like, how can I lower that bar?  So I'm going for the easiest wins possible to start stacking the money.  And that's how I quit my job.  And now we just keep stacking and then we stack and expand.  And that's how we build the empire is little by little easy wins.  Boom, that expand.  Cause now you have the trust and easy upsells wherever you want.  So.  Amazing.  Um, another question, what strategies do you recommend for attracting and  retaining clients in the competitive field of websites?  Well, first, just to clarify, this is the, we're not, I, if Zach reached  it out to somebody and they do have a crappy website or they need a website,  he'll offer it, but he's targeting people that are paying that monthly fee.  And maybe working in that, uh, that website as part of it is not just  targeting people that just need a website as a one-time bill, but I get your question.  So Zach, what are, what are some strategies that you recommend?  By the way, I dropped this already.  I'll drop it again.  If you guys want to check out more of what Zach's up to, he actually does  have, uh, some stuff that he, that he trains and you can check it out on  this website where he goes over like his A to Z process, but for the sake of  this call, what, what are some strategies that you use to attract or reach out  to those people that you want to target those easy wins?  Yeah, I love this question because the gears are turning, right?  And I think the biggest obstacle is irrelevance.  People don't know that you exist.  There's millions of business owners that if they knew you had the skills and knew  who you were and knew your price, they would go with you, but you are, you,  they don't know you, you are invisible in their minds, right?  So the biggest thing is just contacts.  I've used cold outreach a ton.  I have teams in the Philippines that call business owners and they  just find people that are unhappy.  Do they have accents?  Yeah, a little bit, but that's fine.  They're finding people who are unhappy with their current situation.  They set them up for my closers or used to be me.  They set up the appointment",

    "pageContent": "for me.  I talked with that business owner who I already know is unhappy with  their online presence, their website.  They're unhappy and that's an easy win.  So in the beginning I would do the, I would do the cold calls.  You know, I would just call business owners and talk with them.  The thing is just asking them questions and digging in when they answer the  phone to start a conversation.  Hey, see that you're in this area.  Um, I help companies.  I live local, whatever.  Um, what are your thoughts on like how you guys are doing online?  What are your thoughts on your website?  What do you guys want to do better?  Do you guys want to grow?  And if you start having conversations, it can be over the phone.  Um, it can be over email, but just learning about companies.  Now they know that you're even an option.  So I think that's to answer your question.  What strategies do you recommend for attracting and retaining to  attract, they need to know you.  So you need to do way more outreach.  You need to, if you're talking with five companies a day and not having much  success, go talk with 20 comp, 20 business owners a day, and it's  just a numbers game, right?  If more people know about you and know what you do, you'll get better at reaching  out.  So your conversion rates will get higher and higher over time, but  we'll even know that you're an option.  The biggest thing is it's like irrelevance or, um, not even knowing  about you, right?  You need to be known.  So you need to do outreach every day.  You or your team calling business owners, emailing business owners,  reaching out and Facebook groups, however you want to reach out.  I don't care, but you need to talk with people.  You need to care about them.  You need to listen to them.  And if they feel heard, then they'll listen to you.  First, you listen to them.  You understand them.  And then you're able to say, Hey, here are my recommendations based on what I  saw and what I found with your website and your online presence.  Here's what I recommend.  What's your current situation?  How much are you currently paying for everything online?  Oh, we pay this for this.  We pay this for this.  We pay this for this.  Okay, cool.  What if we do this?  Let's do this all way better for this price.  We'll start here.  Uh, once we know that down, we'll then work on your ads and we'll do this.  And boom, now you have another client.  So, I mean, a lot of cold outreach, if you join, you can join local BNI groups,  you can do whatever, but you just need to be talking and connecting with business  owners on a consistent basis.  And then your growth is automatic.  And one other thing too, just as I think I mentioned at the beginning, the thing  that you can be very, you can do is you can be very strategic too, at the type  of clients, the type of businesses that you actually go after and you work with.  So if your goal, you're on this channel, your goal is to actually own  assets and to rent them out.  That's great.  Go and get a handful, go get 20 clients that pay you 500 bucks a month.  You have a $10,000, $10,000 per month.  Your margins are going to be ridiculously high.  You're probably going to be making",

So if you have a bunch of clients in the concrete space or the duct cleaning  space or the masonry space, et cetera, you can now go and you can sell them a  lead gen as well on that note.  What I was going to ask you is, shoot, I had a question regarding that.  Oh, uh, I guess one of their thought, one other thought I'll add to that is like  over time you'll get a better and better at reaching out.  Now I have very targeted campaigns to reach out to, you know, people that are  already paying big marketing companies and I'll get lists of big marketing  companies and we'll target those people.  Find unhappy ones, switch them over, switch them over.  I'll find people that are local to where I live in certain niches that I like to  work with, you know, maybe it's like HVAC companies are good.  Maybe I have experienced cleaning carpets.  My dad owns a carpet cleaning company.  I'm able to speak that language really well.  I'm going to pull a list of local carpet cleaners in Arizona where I live.  And now we have connections that those are easy wins.  So think about your strengths and think about how you can get easy  wins and easy switches to you.  And you'll just stack a monthly recurring revenue.  The other thing about SEO is every single person on this planet that owns  a business you can sell to right at the right price, you can sell SEO to anybody.  And I'm not saying that you should, but you could sell SEO to the person that  owns this company that makes these water bottles or the person that cleans this  office, you know, with lead generation, you have to be a lot more targeted.  So it is nice because anybody that you talk to, even if let's say you, you, you  find somebody, you can sell them SEO, but it's a really competitive city.  It doesn't matter because as long as you charge enough money for that SEO,  you're you it's still money.  Um, so anyway, that's number one.  Number two is I remember when I was going to ask you real quick, and I know you  got to get off for a second, but what is your pro on an average client?  What's your profit margin?  Let's say you make it 500 bucks a month gross.  How much of that are you putting in your pocket out of your 58,000 a month?  How much of that is, is actual profit?  So, yeah, great question.  In the beginning, it was a lot higher, um, because I was doing the sales.  I was, um, involved in the business more.  It was like 70 or 80% profit margin.  Now, um, I have like an SDR team, a sales team, um, website building team, SEO  team, everything's built and just runs.  Um, you know, I have the support team, everything is just dialed in, um, day  to day, there's not honestly a ton for me to do except new things that I want to  implement margin is like 30, 40%.  Um, so, and on top of that, we cross sell our clients to other businesses with  high profit margins, more like the 70, 80% profit margins.  Um, so yeah, it's a pretty good, pretty good system.

You could probably have 90% profit margins.  Like that's not unrealistic.  You wouldn't be doing the work.  You wouldn't be doing the updates on the websites, but that'd be manageable.  Once you start to scale, you're going to have to bring on people.  You're going to have to put in systems.  You're going to have to do some of these things.  And as you scale, your profits going to go down, but you're also scaling.  And, and I know Zach, for example, he doesn't have to do a lot of  the actual work himself.  So anyway, Zach has got to jump onto another call here in three minutes.  I'm going to let him go.  But guys, if you want to check out more of what Zach's up to, go to Zach pile.co.

Either that's crazy or this guy's messing with us, but either way, that's cool.  He might just, he might be feeding us, but, um, yeah, hustler 80 reach out to Zach.  Maybe mention that your username is hustler 80.  Appreciate you being on.  Appreciate everybody being on guys.  See your 20, 25, get out of the rat race.

Welcome to the freaking live digital landlords call that we do every single week at 7 a.m.,  every day, every week of the year, unless I'm on a plane or unless I'm in the bush with  no internet, okay?  One thing that I do need to do, before I forget, hold on.  I do need to get a piece of paper because I always, when I'm doing these calls, I get  all these great ideas and then I need to write them down, like I just barely had one.  So give me just a second, I'm going to write this, it's the 26th I think, no, it's the  25th?  Dude, it was the 26th or 25th yesterday.  Um, all right, okay, guys, can you hear me?  Can somebody give me a comment and let me know if they can hear me really, really quick?  Stephanie, Richard, maybe my, dude, that's, I bet you it's my, uh, I bet you it's my stupid  Facebook.  Let's see here.  Yeah, it is, that's really crazy, I can't even see the comments as they come in.  So I'm going to have Porter read the comments because it lags.  Kevin Williams, what's up?  Kurt Dahlstrom, what's up?  Gina Benson, what's going on, Adair, um, I don't know why there's no notification that  I'm going live.  Sorry about that, Kevin Moss, I'm glad that you found me.  Maybe what we should do, Porter, if you're listening right now, tag everyone, uh, actually  let me just let Porter know really quick.  Yo.  Hey, what's up?  Can you hear me?  Yeah, I can.  What's up, dude?  How are you doing?  I'm good, man.  Hey, um, I just want to see, first of all, if they can see both of us because this has  been a really weird thing with Zoom.  Oh, great.  I want to see me.  That's a phenomenal.  Okay, bro, here's what you're going to do.  Hop off and, uh, and then I think if you get on, I should be able to just bring you on  live.  Yeah.  Hop off and just, just watch it as a guest or make a comment.  Let me see if I can bring you on that way.  Cause for some reason, something's up with my stripe or my stripe, my, uh, my zoom, by  the way, welcome Erwin McKenzie.  Yeah.  Hop off and just join as a guest, dude.  And I'll try to bring you on.  Cool.  Okay.  I'll hop off.  Cool.  My comments are finally showed up.  Erwin McKenzie.  What's going on, dude?  I think this is your first live call.  Welcome to the call.  Clellan Bradshaw.  What's up?  Uh, from Beaver, Utah.  Good to have you on, dude.  Mahmood.  What's up?  Stephanie can hear me.  Fine.  Uh, some people got the notification.  Some people didn't.  I have no idea what's going on.  Laura Shepherd morning.  All right.  We're going to try to get Porter.  Hopefully Porter can, uh, join.  Okay.  Let's see if I can get Porter to come on here.  Why doesn't it give me the option to bring Porter on?  It gives me the option to bring on other people. ",

Yeah, basically.  Um, I got a little preventative, uh, dermatology done guys.  I got some spots burnt or frozen off my nose.  So I'm in just recovery phase here, but it had to happen at some point.

I'm going to have to, I'm going to have to, okay, there that is, that's going to work.  It's going to say, I think it's giving me the option.  It says I can, it says I have the little green button there, bud.  All right.  Let me see if I can pull it up from my computer.  Let Porter on and then we'll shake and bake here.  Let's see if I can find myself live.  It shows the, aha, there we go, wait, Porter, did that send you notification, bud?  I think we're good.  I think we're going to be able to do it.  Your audience is set to custom.  What is going on people?  Audience set to custom.  Why are there so many settings?  Why can't we just go live?  Ah, boy, audience.  That's crazy.  Porter, it says I'm, I'm, I'm letting you on.  Nick Ford, what's up, dude?  All right.  If I hold on to your name, dude, it's given me this option.  If anyone could tell me what to do here, it says your audience is set to custom.  So many people you select can watch this live broadcast.  That's great.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Okay.  One more thing.  Just give me one second, guys.  If this doesn't work, we're going to, we're going to improvise here, how to change my  audience from custom.  Just see really quick.  There's a way on the menu, top right at Facebook.  Okay.  This should be just a second here.  All right.  It says on my post, hit the buttons, oops, hit the buttons, whoops, whoops, whoops, whoops.  Tap your name, scroll down to the post, tap my name, scroll down to the post.  Oh, boy.  Okay.  I think this will work.  Let's hope.  If not, then we're just going to go anyway.

Let's just do this thing.  Try to jump back on that link here.  Let me send you one more link, and then we'll just get going, guys.  Apologize for that.  While Porter's jumping on, I'm actually going to do this.  Porter, I'm going to send you a link.  I'm going to share a couple of things.  Matthew McClellan, what's up?  Wouldn't Porter be a presenter?  Yeah, I don't know.  I'm going to try to send him.  That's wild.  All right.  We're going to send this one more time, but I'm going to, I got a couple of things I want  to say without Porter jumping on anyway.  Okay.  Here we go.  One more time.  All right.

Exciting and also terrifying, right?  Uh, I, it's exciting if you're actually doing the work, if you're, if you're on track to  hit goals, if you're seeing yourself progress, it's really exciting.  And I've been on the other, last year, I'll be honest, I was on the other side of the,  uh, by the way, Porter, I'm going to let you on just a second.  Let me just finish my thought.  Yes.  Last year I was on the other side of the coin where I was like, oh my gosh, time's slipping  by and I don't know if I think I've done anything.  Right?  Um, and I've said this a few times, guys, admittedly, last year I, uh, I was in a, in  a weird mental fog, but, um, I'm, I'm ready this year.  I'm, I'm here.  I'm ready.  I'm pumped.  Um, one thing that I draw, I want to just remind you guys of, I put this in the, uh,  the group.  I made a post about this.  If you guys have not already, I have a, uh, PDF that I share with you guys with a book  called The Slide Edge.  Go and start reading that book for just read 10 pages a day.  Do it on your phone.  That's probably the equivalent of like four or five pages on a regular book.  Just go read 10 pages of this book every single day and start to make tiny implementations  of what this book is teaching you guys.  And it's going to freaking change your business.  Okay.  Um, I don't, I don't have a kickback from this book.  That link is a free PDF.  This isn't some kind of weird affiliate thing.  It is literally just completely given me so much momentum.  Go check this book out.  I've made Porter.  Watch this or start reading this as well.  If you guys didn't see my post, go and search my name.

It's your life, but it's, it's been one of the best things I've done.  I started it almost exactly a month ago and everything is completely changed in, in the  better.  And I sincerely mean that.  It sounds a little bit like a cheesier over the top, but I'm dead serious.  It's been amazing.  Okay.  Um, another thing that I was going to just say really, really quick, and this is before  Porter hops on, um, Richard says, can you send that link again?  I'm not really sure what link you're talking about.  My friend, uh, I sent the link to Porter, but he's, he's in the waiting room.  So I'm gonna let him on.  I don't know which link you're talking about, sir.  Um, you know what I was thinking about yesterday?  I was sitting on the treadmill and I have a couple of buddies that I know personally  that are in this group.  Okay.  And, uh, you actually, anyone that knows me is going to think I'm talking about them,  but there's some, there was two specific, there was actually one specific person I had  in mind.  Um, and I was sitting there thinking in my head, like I was about to text them last night  and, and say, cause I went to the gym a little bit late.  I was about to say, uh, where are you at?  Why are, why have I not seen you get a deal recently?  Why are you not, um, posting that you got to win?  You know, and I, that's how my thoughts started.  And then I just started thinking about like Porter, who I'm about to bring on, who's,  uh, at 10,700, he actually went up a hundred dollars after replacing these clients.  And I wanted to just, then I started to just get pissed off.  And I was thinking, like, guys, if you're watching this stream right now and you, like,  you're not annoyed that me and Porter are making the kind of money that we're making  from renting simple websites.  Like you don't know, like the, the, the, the basicness of our personalities, of our education  level, it should, it should piss you off.  Okay.  We are not by any means, oh, it's, you know, like we have, we have no tech experience.  Okay.  We've never done websites.  We didn't grow up doing that.  We grew up literally working on the farm and, and not everyone, I know some of you guys  are beating Porter, but he's beating a lot of you guys.  Like he's kicking your butt.  He is at 10,700.  He replaced two of his clients on Saturday.  He's got another deal in the works this week.  And some of you guys are, I see you every week on the stream and you're still not getting  a deal.  Like, what are you doing?  What are you?  Are you like, are you going to ever get a deal?  Are you ever going to get the next deal?  Are you ever going to, or is it just going to be a constant blame everybody else and  the time that you don't have and the weather and the fact that you got so much going on?  It's like, so does he dude.  He's Porter's got a kid.  Porter's got a full-time thing",

Porter's kicking your butt.  Have a little bit of pride.  Get pissed off.  Doesn't mean you have to hate on Porter or wish bad on Porter.  But guys, I remember when I was just starting, I would see people posting in the group that  were making money.  And to be honest, I think they were lying because now looking back on it, those people  are, I see sometimes their Facebook friends and stuff.  I'm like, dude, they were never making any money, but that's another story.  And I would see these posts and I would just piss me off.  I'm like, and I wasn't like, oh, they took money out of my pocket.  It was like, Nick, pull your freaking head out, dude.  These guys, I'm looking at them.  I'm seeing the post, whether it was real or not.  I'm going to their profile.  I'm like, dude, this guy, I'm better than this guy.  And I don't mean that in like a arrogant way, but like, dude, I know that if this guy can  get a deal, if this guy's at $10,000 a month, this guy's at $20,000 a month, what are you  doing?  Like, what are they doing that you're not doing?  Come on.  Have a little bit of pride, guys.  I want you guys to get excited.  I want you guys to get on these calls.  I want you guys to have good energy.  But like, when is enough enough?  When is it like, dude, this is too much.  I've got to get a freaking deal, right?  Like, when are you going to draw a line in the sand and say, look, I paid to be in this  program.  I'm here.  I'm getting on the lives.  I've gone through the training.  I've chosen this as the business model.  It's time to get a deal, guys.  You might have to get scrappy.  You might have to call every single person in your phone and tell them that you do lead  generation and tell them that you can get them more leads to get your first deal.  And you might have to follow up with that with that same list.  I think Hermosy talks about this in $100 million leads.  You might have to reach out to every single person and follow up with them every single  day for the next month.  But if you took every contact, you know, that owns a business and you followed up with them  every day for a month, you cannot tell me you couldn't squeeze a deal out of that.  You could not.  You cannot tell me you can't get a $300, $500, $750, $1,000 a month deal by just squeezing  your contacts.  You cannot tell me that.  Okay, guys, me and Francesca are getting scrappy.  We're doing stuff.  We're posting.  You guys saw my post yesterday.  We're posting in yard sale groups.  We're posting here.  She's going to the Chamber of Commerce looking at this, shaking hands, kissing babies, going  around town.  We're doing all kinds of stuff, testing all",

He's at $10,700 a month with a full-time job, with a baby, married, has every excuse not  to be making money, and he's running circles around some of you guys.  We've all got stuff going on.  When I started, I had a full-time thing doing door-to-door sales.  I had a kid, one on the way.  I had a team to manage.  I had church responsibilities, all that stuff.

That's all I got.  Okay, let's get Porter on here.  You're not even going to be able to see him, but who cares, because some of you guys...  Porter, can you hear me?  Porter.  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, I'm just going to pin you, because apparently this is the dumbest thing ever.  I don't know.  I'm going to make you the co-host.  We're going to start with that.  Then I'm going to pin you, and then we're going to just go.  Guys, you're not going to be able to see Porter.  Sorry about that.  We're just going to roll.  Listen to his voice.  My Facebook also is lagging.  Facebook has some of the crappiest tools on the internet.  They don't want to work with anyone.  They're like Apple, but at least Apple has good products.  If Facebook wasn't so convenient, I'd get off of Facebook in five seconds.  Screw you, Mark.  All right.  I'm just annoyed right now.  By the way, slide edge.  Sorry.  That's what Richard was talking about.  Thank you, Nick.  He was talking about...  Can you share the link?  There's the slide edge.  You guys can't see Porter.  We're just going to go.  Porter, I'm going to give a little bit of a backdrop.  Porter, he was at $10,600 about a week ago.  He had a client that wasn't paying.  It was one of those deals where they're missing a payment and all this different stuff.  By the way, guys, if you do have clients like this, don't just accept it.  Don't just let them walk all over you.  Realize that you're the one that holds the keys, the leverage.  Anyway, he had this client that wasn't paying, and he knew he had to replace this client.  It's a scary thing.  No one wants to replace a client.  Sometimes we're sitting there going, man, I'll keep dealing with it.  No.  Then he had another one that I think that's another one canceled, right?  No.  He",

I apologize, but we're just going to go with this because we want to get the information.  You're going to see me.  You're going to listen to Porter.  Porter, tell the story about how you lost the clients, dude.  Yeah.  The first one, it was actually my first ever client that I landed three years ago, or two  and a half years ago.  Yeah, old nester, dude.  Anyways, it was in Concrete, and he was behind three payments.  He always gave the mentality of...  He always paid.  I always knew he was going to pay.  He was never on time.  It was always two or three weeks past.  I was like, bro, this is so annoying.  I felt like he was almost like that weak link in my business.  I was like, dude, how am I supposed to do this if I had five or six of these same guys?  I was like, I just got to cut the fat.  As hard as it was because I was at 10,000, and I was like, dude, I don't want to drop below.  I was like, he's not paying me anyways.  I'm like, what am I doing?  I'm just sitting here.  That guy basically told him, hey, I got to go look for somebody else.  Sorry.  The next guy, I literally sent him over a lead, and then he called me or texted me.  He's like, hey, when's our four-month contract up?  I was like, oh, it's up.  We need to renew it anyways.  He wasn't closing as many jobs anyway.  He was one of those business owners where he was satisfied to get the jobs.  He was quoting them high because he was busy.  His excuse was, dude, I'm so booked out that I literally can't even take on any more jobs.  I'm basically pointless.  I'm like, well, that's a good thing.  That's what you want.  Anyways, the whole thing, I didn't even try.  Most of the time, I try to make something work.  I try to sell through a client and try to say, hey, let's try this.  This might really help you if they're not selling type deal.  This one, I was like, you can't really argue with that.  I don't know what to say.  That was Saturday of last week.  Both those happened.  Two in one day, I was like, are you crapping me?  It just takes the breath out of you when you lose two clients like that.  That's how I lost them.  Okay.  Porter went from $10,600 per month down to what?  What did that drop you to?  Well, one was $1,200.  The other one was $1,600.  That puts you at $9,400.  You were at $8,800.  Yep.  Porter went from $10,600 to $8,800 overnight.  What a way to start a Saturday.  Love that for you, bro.  What a great Saturday.  I had no idea this was going on, by the way.  Guys, first thing I",

Then I saw this.  I opened it up.  Dude, I went through it.  Every single one of the little coupons that was a business, that was a home service business,  I put it on the side.  Had a big old stack of them, and I think my kid threw it away.  I think Riggs threw it away.  I put it on top of the stair rail to go up to the office, and I can't find it.  But that's a great way.  Guys, they're paying for freaking leads.  They're paying money to try and get leads.  That's what they're looking for.  Those are great, warm leads.

Porter, if you didn't know how to do this process, you didn't know how to run ads,  don't you think if you took a list of all the people you know that do concrete, all  the people you know that do fencing, all the people you know that do tree service, that  if you called them and text them and did something every day in 30 days, you couldn't get a  deal?  Oh, for sure.  Through your contact list, I guarantee you get a deal.  Dude, go through your Facebook friends.  Every person that has a company, write it down.  Go buy Hermosy's book.  He talks about it.  He's like, you just reach out to him.  Here's what you say.  And guys, it's literally that's how simple it is.  If it's been 60 days you don't have a deal, shame on you.  Have some pride in yourself.  It's enough is enough.  Guys, we're two months into the year.  Now I'm down just getting annoyed that it's on you.  Borders using the same training that you guys are using to get deals, to replace deals.  So is everybody else out there.  Francesca, who doesn't even speak English as her first language.  Guys, she came to the US as a 16 year old kid that didn't speak English.  She's landing deals.  Not with my help, not using me.  She's landing deals.  You guys need to land deals.  Have some pride.  It's enough.  It's done.  Okay.  So first thing, guys, once you do get deals, just know that you're going to lose a client.  Okay.  I don't care how good it is.  I don't care how many good leads you send.  I don't care how many, you know, whatever.  How many reports you send.  How many times you send them a card in the mail.  You're going to lose clients.  That's just the fact of the matter.  Why?  Because guys, sometimes these clients, they don't know how to close.  And that's not always the case, but that you lose them.  Sometimes it's your fault.  But sometimes, guys, they just suck at closing.  They should",

So just accept the fact that you are going to lose clients.  That's just it.  Okay.  So Porter, when that happened, what was your first reaction?  Because I've done this before and I've lost clients and it's made me sick.  But I'll tell you, it's a lot worse when you're doing SEO.  But go ahead.  What was your first reaction?  What was your thoughts?  What was your feelings?  Well, the first reaction, I was kind of like, I was pissed off, first of all,  because I was like, this has happened to me before.  And I'm like, I'm providing the leads.  And you kind of just want to just say, I'm just going to take the day off.  I'm just going to lay in bed.  I'm just going to just chill.  I'll start hitting it Monday.  But I actually started hooking my clients Saturday.  I immediately got on the phone and I started calling business owners because  the last time that this happened to me, I remember it took the air out of me.  I almost stayed at two or three deals for a couple months because I literally  was being such a pansy about just getting back on the phone.  I was taking it so personal that these business owners dropped me.  And this time I just had a better mindset.  I was like, dude, I'm not letting this affect me.  Like 10K is where I'm staying.  I'm not dropping below that.  So it was just like the standard of like, I got to stay above this.  Like this, you know, you hit something, you're just like, dude, I'm doing this.  And it's crazy what you can do when you have like the willpower or just like  the, I don't know, the urgency.  I don't know if that's like a better word, survival.  In that book, it talks about being like survival.  And you're like, when you need to like do something, you will do it.  And that's kind of where I was at.  I was like, dude, I got to, I got to get some deals.  Yeah, guys, it's just about standards, right?  So this is a really simple analogy that I've heard.  You've probably heard a million times.  I'm not trying to pretend it's my own.  It's not original.  It's like we have this financial thermostat, right?  And how a thermostat works is how the analogy goes is when you have a thermostat  set at 70, if it gets to 68, the heat kicks on, right?  You go back to 70.  If it gets to 72, the cool, the AC kicks on to go back to 70.  We have this thermostat of what we think we're worth.  And as soon as we go below it, we're going to do everything we can to get to it.  It's crazy.  Like we start scrapping our way and we start going into like, I can't breathe mode.  We start going into like, this is the only thing that matters.  Nothing else is important.  I got to get back to the certain baseline and you'll do everything.  You'll get scrappy, creative, everything.  And the reverse is true, too.  You think you're worth 10K a month and you make 15K one month and all of a sudden you  start self-sabotaging.  You start",

    "pageContent": "taking the day off.  You start doing all this stuff.  So the key is like, how do you get your standard hire?  Some of you guys, and I'm not trying to be rude here, but clearly some of you guys have  a standard of making no money, right?  Like in this business, your standard is zero because you're not urgent.  You're not doing whatever it takes to get a deal.  You're content sitting there watching the training for the third time in a row and  tweedling around with your website when you need to just pick up the phone and call  somebody or walk into a business or go on Facebook or call your uncle or whatever.  But get a deal.  Make something happen, right?  So it's a good point.  Once you get to a certain point, guys, and I feel like when you get to these really good,  even numbers, like you get to the 10K and you kind of have this identity.  And it's really good, too, because everyone wants Porter hit 10K.  We're like, hey, Porter's at 10K.  Last thing he wants to do is drop below 10K.  He's now a 10K person, right?  When I made seven figures in 2020, it was the weirdest thing in my mind.  I was like, oh, I can't go.  I can never make less than a million dollars, right?  I can never make less than a million dollars no matter what happens.  And guys, even like, for example, last year, it was a weird year.  A lot of personal stuff took my eye off the ball in some ways.  Maybe you guys saw it.  Maybe you didn't.  But I did.  Even then, I still made far above a million dollars, like well above a million dollars,  because even with all the distraction, even with all the personal stuff, I knew, hey,  I don't make less than a million dollars.  And so this year, I sat down and I was like, it's time for me to change that standard.  Like, a million is no longer even close to acceptable.  And the same way that I'm telling you guys you should get annoyed that Porter's at $10,600,  $10,700, is I'm looking at people around me that I know that are making a million dollars a month  in one of their businesses.  And I'm like, dude, there's nothing different between that guy and me.  Why are they beating me?  What am I doing?  Why am I still content at making a couple million bucks when I should be making five figures?  I should be at $10 million a month.  I made my first million five years ago, four years ago.  You know, I should be at 10.  I should be at 10 plus, period.  What am I doing?  What are you doing, Nick?  Big wake up call.  Roll my goals down.  And this year, everything's changing.  Changing my standard.  Getting around different people.  So Porter, how did you how do you think people can change their standard of what they think they're worth?  And I don't want to get too much into like this mindset stuff because I want to keep this on tactical stuff.  But also, how does somebody that's never gotten a deal or that's barely making two, three thousand, four thousand bucks,  barely paying the bills at their regular job, how do they get the mindset of like, hey, I have to I have to make a certain amount?  Like, how do you create that?  How did you get to that point?  It definitely took a little",

    "pageContent": "bit of time.  I wish I would have gotten there faster because now that you've gotten there, you look back and you're like, if I would have just changed a few of these things,  I think the number one thing is I just think I was so analysis paralysis or I was too afraid to like make a jump in like spending money or doing certain things.  Like it's like you kind of just dabble, you know, for a while you're just dabbling.  You're like, I'm going to run a website, I'm going to run an ad.  And then you're like, I'm going to call a business owner.  I'm also going to call like five of them.  If one of them pick up, I'll do it.  But then it becomes like it's like, no, I'm going to do this until I get it.  I'm going to get someone on the hook.  And then it's like, no, I'm going to run this ad until I get leads.  Like, there's no reason I shouldn't because I've seen it work.  And it's like there's too many people in the group.  The thing that changed it for me was, again, seeing people in the group get deals that I knew that I thought I was better than them in a humble way.  But like I thought I could do better than them.  And so I think seeing other people get deals, I knew the process worked, but I knew it was my insecurities and my personal feelings of like what I thought I was capable of.  That was the biggest thing holding me back.  So I think I honestly for me to get to that point, I think I had to fake it until like I literally had to say, hey, I think I'm worth this, even though I necessarily don't feel like I am, but I'm going to be this.  Like, you know what I'm saying?  Like, that's kind of what you have to do until you feel that way.  Yeah, I agree.  And another thing, guys, another thing that will really help you is getting around people that are making a lot more money than you.  And I'm not saying that that should be the only thing that you look for in friends, right?  Because if they're just crappy human beings, that may not be worth it.  But we are talking about money in this group.  This group is not necessarily a group we're talking about, you know, whatever.  We're talking about money.  We're talking about money.  So in that regard, guys, one of the easiest ways to really get your standards changed or really to shake up your to really mind after yourself is start getting around people that are making way more money than you.  Right.  Because all of a sudden you start to see the way that they live their lives.  You start to see the way that they don't even think about the decisions they make aren't based on price.  They're based on convenience and time and, you know, things like that.  Like, I remember when I started hanging out with one of my only friends, I don't have a lot of friends that I really hang out with one of my only friends.  And I started to make I was starting to make a little bit of money.  I think this is around I actually became friends with them before I made my first seven figures.  But I remember that the first time I made some decent money, he's we went to Mexico and I'm like, so where are we going to stay?  And he just sent me the link.  He's like, I booked here and I pulled it up and it was like, you know, five hundred six hundred bucks a night, not all inclusive.",

So, you know, I went there for like a five, six days.  It was like two, three, twenty five hundred three thousand dollars.  And I was like, dude, if I want to continue to be this guy's friend where I get invited to go to do stuff.  I mean, the guy's talking about like, hey, I don't let's just let's just split a private plane to go down there so we can just go straight out of, you know, St.  George Airport.  He started to make these kind of comments.  I got me like, OK, I got it.  I got to pull my head out.  What am I doing?  I'm sitting over here thinking I'm hot crap making, you know, a hundred grand a month.  This dude's making a million dollars a month.  Like, I got to step this thing up.  So, guys, you start getting around people that are making a lot more than you.  I guess I should say this, they have higher standards than you and you are naturally going to have higher standards.  Porter, how do you do that?  Because Porter lives in a town.  And by the way, there's some people in this in that town that are in this group.  And guys, welcome.  I know there's a couple of you guys that joined recently.  Dakota.  I don't know if you're on here, Dakota, but if you are, welcome, dude.  He's in a town where there's some people that are doing some things.  But a lot of the people, I would say the average income in that town, it's got to be like four grand.  Right.  Maybe monthly.  Maybe maybe four to six grand.  And people are really content with that, which in some ways I actually really respect because it's like, yeah, money doesn't make you happy.  I get that.  But it's also it's tough when you're around that type of people all the time that like you're the big frickin dog, man.  You're you're making 10 grand, dude.  You know, your your donation at church is fat, dude.  And it's like, no, you're tricking little small chimp.  You're like, you're just a little fish.  Right.  And I'm the same way compared to a lot of people, too.  How do you do that?  How do you how do you have the high standard of, you know, hey, by the way, Porter, 10 grand, you're still making baby money, bro.  Let's go.  I know.  You are, dude.  Come on.  I mean, let's see.  Twenty.  What are you?  Twenty five.  Yeah, it is unacceptable.  Twenty five, twelve.  So you're like you're ripping like 120 a year.  I mean, dude, at twenty five, I'd be like two hundred and ten.  Just no.  I mean, throw your face a little bit, a little bit, a little salt in the wound.  You got it.  You get you're not.  You got to pick this up, dude.  Twenty K.  Then we can start, you know, flexing a tiny bit.  But how do you do it, bro?  Because I know that what it's like, like and that's one of the reasons I like to be around people that are successful. ",

I don't know if it's drug money, but nonetheless, they got cash.  Dinner, seven hundred and fifty dollars for two people.  That's you got to have cash.  What what do you do when you live around people that are at a lower standard to raise the standard?  I think I try to do that that same mindset, but it's got to be online.  It's got to be within the group.  It's got to be like I'm rubbing shoulders with with obviously you.  I talked to Jeff like you talked to Francesca like you just talked to people that you know are making money or landing deals constantly.  Like Mahmood making good money.  And it just kind of just makes you wait.  Sixty five K a month. He doesn't talk that he doesn't.  Yeah, as much as that sixty five K a month.  He's a sleeper. Keep going.  Yeah. But like that, it's just like, dude, these guys are making a lot of money.  So it's like I have to like be around those people in the group.  So like, yeah, if you can't be there physically, try to be there, you know, socially on their rub shoulders with them.  Comment like I for the longest time, I hated posting because I just didn't want you.  You don't know. You don't want people to know you.  You know what I'm saying?  Like, especially I'm your brother, too.  So I'm like kind of like hiding back and whatever.  And then I'm like, you know, then you kind of change.  You're like, what's so bad about people knowing your business in a way?  You know what I'm saying?  You kind of switch the mindset.  And so I think as soon as I started doing that, I kind of just was like it was like this eye opening thing.  It's crazy when you really start to think that you're you're actually this like right now.  But you're a big fish in a small pond, but but you're really a small fish and, you know, a massive pond, right?  That's kind of what you need to be.  So I just try to do it online and the Facebook group post be around people that can motivate you.  Yeah, guys, that's one of the reasons that you you maybe you didn't even join for this reason.  But this is one of the best things about this community is think about where we all came from.  We all have our lives. We're all in our situations.  We're all surrounded by people that are living average lives.  Maybe we were in the free Facebook group.  Maybe you came from the school community, you know, whatever.  And we basically sucked all the people out of there that are ready to do this for real.  Right. And so we filtered everyone out.  And these are the people in this group that are here to do this for real.  And you are surrounded by all the winners.  Right. Ma Moon's making sixty five thousand dollars a month.  Mike V's making forty thousand dollars a month.  These are U.S. numbers, by the way.  I'm not going to say this guy's name, because I don't know if he wants me to.  But there's a guy that just joined. This is not Ryan Dalton.  He makes one hundred and twenty thousand dollars per month.  He's not talking much, but he's in the group. He just joined.  We got Ryan Dalton six hundred thousand dollars a month.",

Guys, you are surrounded by people that are making some freaking cheddar in this group.  So go and be of value to these people.  Do not message them and say, hey, can I jump on the phone with you?  Because I'm going to not let them. OK, they're not going to.  But like, add some value.  If you see one of them post and you have an answer or you find something valuable, share it with them.  Go and make yourself known. You don't have to be super loud.  But like Porter's been doing a really good job.  He's been sharing his wins, sharing where he's at, sharing his losses. Right.  And then people can say they know who he is.  And that's not a bad thing, because now Porter's like, I'm the 10K guy.  Well, if you're at eight today, we'd just be freaking roasting you, dude.  You can't go below ten. Right. You can't go below.  Guys, go read freaking Porter. Tell these guys about slight edge.  I had Porter start the slight edge. Give it give it a review.  What are you on page like 80?  Yeah, I'm on page like 80. But it's it's totally like when you first like the first.  It's one of those books that it's not you don't have to wait a few chapters to get into it.  It's like it like hits hard and like the first couple of pages.  Like it's insane. Right. Yeah.  It is so cool. But it just makes you like this.  It's all your mindset. And it's like you already know what to freaking do, guys.  It's just us. Yeah. You just got it. It's all these little things.  Guys, if you want to skip to a chapter talking about this, this specific topic of, you know,  learning a specific skill, Chapter 13 talks about mentors.  And that's anyway, just as a quick note.  And I know that because I've been recommending this book to a lot of people recommending certain chapters,  screenshotting pieces.  This is just a very simple book about a simple strategy that if you'll just do these things,  guys, everything's going to change for you.  Like just simple stuff. Reading 10 pages a day.  Just all like just these little tiny things. Right.  If depending on what your goals are.  For me, it's like I need to make a post every single day on certain social media channels.  I need to do.  I mean, obviously the gym to me.  That's just the standard at this point.  I need to make a certain amount of money.  But in order to make that certain amount of money, I have to do these little tiny things.  So guys, go freaking just just 10 pages on your phone every day.  What does it take you 10 minutes?  Oh, not even that.  You know, sometimes like yesterday I was eating Chipotle after the gym, which that's it.  That was a decision, right?  Like, hey, I'm going to eat this 600, 700 calorie bowl instead of going and smashing Buffalo Wild Wings and waking up groggy.  You know what I mean? Like those little tiny things.  Drinking water.

Your boys get that dialed in sleep.  These are all little things that are contributing.  Anyway, guys, so we're going to get back into the tactical.  So I just wanted to go on a little soapbox on that, but go check out that book.  So guys, to raise that mindset, get around people to raise the standard, get around people that are making a lot more money than you.  And this group is a perfect way to do it.  You can do it by getting on these calls and listening to the mindset, listening to the like, you know, people that have, you know, options, people that have freedom.  You get around that. It gets infectious.  They have the ability to go and do stuff that you can't.  And it's exciting and it should piss you off a little bit.  So, okay, Porter, let's talk about what you did.  So as soon as you got the news that you're losing the deals, you decided.  So you actually got the news on Saturday morning that you lost the deals.  Or does it Friday?  No, it was Saturday morning, dude.  It was the chitiest Saturday, dude.  My heart hurt. It was like my dog died or something, dude.  It's so sad, dude.  And it's worse when you have kids because you're like your kids.  You're like, dude, that just took some opportunity out of my.  We could have taken a little forward to Disney.  You know, dude, I felt so bad a little bit.  Okay.  So so you got the news on both or you the one you kind of knew was coming, but the one you hit hit you on Saturday, right?  Yeah. So it was like one.  I was like, okay, I could drop below a little bit.  Right. And then.  And so I had so I had one deal that was going to be a new deal.  So I was working on him. I had a business owner hooked.  Then I decided to just cut the cut the fat with the other guy.  And then, bam, Saturday morning, three business owners that I was like, she is broke.  Okay. So so this is an important thing, guys.  Well, soon as Porter lost the deal, he got right on it.  He got pissed off instead of being like, oh, what was me?  Oh, my. I'm a victim. Oh, oh, of course.  The Porter, you know, guys, everyone's lost deals, dude.  I lost a four thousand dollar deal at SeaWorld.  And I was making eight grand a month.  Like, dude, that's that's when you go.  That's when you're like, yeah, I don't know about that churro.  You can't tell that you can't tell wifey.  You can't tell the kids they can't have the churro.  But you're like, how am I going to pay for that?  Pay for the churro.  The churro is like eight bucks, dude, pretty pricey.  We're going back for round two.  You know what I'm saying?  It goes a long way when you just lost a four thousand dollar client.  Been there, bro.  First and foremost, guys, you this is why you build assets.  This is why you don't do you don't trade time for dollars.  You build assets because now Porter's like, OK, screw you, Bob.  Screw you.",

Did you even have any leads to send?  Did you like did you just start rip?  Like did you have your old list or what was the first thing you did?  You go lock yourself in your office. You go on a drive.  How did you make the calls?  So, yeah, dude, I do.  So, dude, I could just rip calls in the truck, dude.  So I just get in the V10, the gas log, dude, and I start trailing the farm roads, dude.  And then I was taking these leads because this guy wasn't calling these leads because he was so booked out.  So that was the one guy.  So I was literally calling leads back like weeks and weeks.  And some of these were like, yeah, I'd love a quote.  So I sent over like two one day and then like I waited a little bit, sent another two.  So it was fast. That one was to cake.  And the other one, this one was a little bit slower.

And I was like, hey, like I work with a couple of different contractors, whatever, me and this other guy working together.  But I could also send you another guy like I don't want to step on anyone's toes.  But like I could give you another option. And they're like, yeah, send them over.  So I sent them over the same lead and I let the business owner know because I didn't want him thinking I was giving this to two different guys.  But I was like, you know, I was working with this other guy, whatever. He didn't have a problem with it.  So anyways, that's what I was doing. But yeah, I was I just went in my truck, dude.  I just was like, I got to go take a little breather. And I just and I had a list already.  So I knew that like I had it already prepared because I think I hooked one of the guys like that first client I had.  It was the first call I did. So I had this whole list ready.  So I just went and started making calls right after.  Dude, one one little hack, guys, is I agree.  I definitely recommend you do your closing calls from your Zoom.  But for some reason, getting in your car and driving around and doing calls, I think it's because you're not this is not safe.  I'm not saying this is the top safety protocol here, but use your Bluetooth, whatever I get in the freaking Tesla, dude, just I recline that seat like I'm basically about to take a nap.  And, dude, I got the thing on on the Bluetooth.  And, dude, for some reason, being distracted and looking at the way I'm driving, I'm so much more calm like I'm not.  Don't get me wrong. I'm still sweating.  I'm still freaking pouring sweat down my back and my face when I'm calling, even doing it this long.  Sometimes for some of you guys that are terrified, jump in your car, go on a drive and just take your list with you and call them while you're driving.  Call them",

You're sitting there taking your feet and you're like, I don't know.  But if you're moving and doing something, it seems to help.  So Porter, thank goodness he followed the process, right?  He had the list already built.  He knew who we wanted to contact.  One thing that I like that you did, he went and called some of the old leads that he that the guy never quoted or the guy never closed.  Whatever the guy's not paying him this this guy Nestor.  So it's like he's not obligated to do anything.  He went and called him and he hustled.  He didn't say, well, I'm going to wait for some more leads to come in.  He just went and called him.  So how do you what's the pitch like to a business owner?  You have somebody you know they're going to cancel.  You can just see it.  You can smell it, right?  They missed a few payments.  They're a little unhappy.  You've got a Zoom scheduled next Thursday.  They want to review things.  You have a good feeling.  You kind of know they're going to cancel at some point.  How what do you say to the new when you're calling the new list?  What do you say to the business owner that's different than when you don't have a business owner?  I guess the only I guess I ask him different questions.  I think it's like, OK, that business owner that I just lost, what is one quality that that they have that I didn't know they had?  You know, when I started working with them, so I think I started I asked a little bit better questions.  Like maybe it's like, hey, like I really started to focus on like, hey, how much you make and how long you've been a business.  Like, I think that was his problem was he just wasn't making a lot of money.  Like he wasn't he didn't have any source of lead flow.  It was just me, which, yeah, you're fine with just doing this.  But like most other guys have their own brand or mouth, all these different things.  And so like one of the guys I quoted, dude, this is hilarious.  I got on the phone with him and he I was like, hey, how much are you making like per month?  And he's like, two. And I was like, like, two hundred thousand.  He's like, no, two million. And then I was like, OK.  And then he's like, hold on, give me one sec. And he walks out of his house and he's like, sorry, you mean my wife for going through divorce.  I don't want her to see the numbers. I don't want to hear that.  Somebody you're working with. Yeah, this is one of my clients, dude.  He was hilarious. So dogs make it two mil.  And you thought he was making way less. Yeah.  And so I literally I was like, because you just don't know, like you talked to him on the phone.  You're like, this guy is probably making a couple hundred thousand a year.  Right. And this guy takes me outside.  He's flexing all he's got, like, three fifties, like trailers, like everything.  And so in my mind, I was like, dude, I think I'd get a little bit more.  But I was like, I'm not going to be greedy.",

He's like, honestly, I probably won't even know what's coming out.  That's awesome. Just got or somebody you got before.  No, this is the client that I got Saturday.  I love that. Guys, if you could ever get your business owners talking like that and they like to flex a little bit,  let them flex, stroke the ego a little bit.  And also, even though they're making a bunch of money, yeah, you might be able to charge them a little bit more.  But also, I'm a big believer of leaving some meat on the bone.  Charge a fair price because you could go back to that client and get the second, third, fourth, fifth deal.  So really good things that I want to point out there.  OK, Gina says we are getting deals. I love Gina's got a little pride.  She's like, Nick, you're talking smack. I'm over here getting deals.  She says we have deals in the works right now. We're on track for our quarter one goals.  This is perfect timing because we do need to replace a business owner.  We'll post some wins. I love it. Post some wins.  I would love to hear about it, Gina. Sean Sean says Gina is super scrappy.  I love that. Porter, get close to the mic.  Well, that was a little late, but Porter, get close to the mic.  I don't think you have. Porter, you need to get yourself a mic, dude.  No, I know. You have those lights still that I gave you?  Yeah, I got them. Are you using them right now?  No, I haven't got them on.  Get yourself a blue yeti. A hundred bucks, dude.  Listen to this. This is awesome. Nick Kudlik.  His warm network is what got me to $9,300 a month.  Nick Kudlik is somebody you guys don't know because he doesn't post.  Frickin' post, Nick, I want people to know about you.  This dude's been just working his warm network and behind-the-scenes silent killer is at $9,300 a month.  And I think he even lost the deal. I think he got over $10K just using his warm network.  You have deals in your back pocket, guys. Go fricking hit them up.  You guys know all the people with like the Mary Kay and the doTERRA and the Sensei and all these things.  Dude, you got some of these housewives that are hustling harder than you guys.  Frickin' running these shows, dude. Selling Tupperware, making more money than some of you guys.  And you guys are actually selling something that can make them money, okay?  Go get scrappy. I'm not saying to send a fricking Facebook post that says, hey, you'd be a great...  No. Follow the process the best that you can, but you got people in your warm network.  Okay, my mood. Agree, Porter. You got to hook a better B.O. immediately.  Otherwise, your heartbreak will live in your head rent-free.  A hundred percent. You got to take action quick. You got to use that...  Guys, whenever I was on the doors and I would get a no, I would never take a break, dude.  It was like next door. And I would take out all my anger on that door.  And even if I didn't do",

I'm back on the phone today and excited that I will help another offense contractor make some serious money.  Exactly. And that's the beautiful thing, guys, is you have assets that are paying you 30 leads a month, dude.  That that's you could I think you guys could charge up with fencing 30 leads.  That's a $2,000 a month deal. You guys can count it as a win.  Get him under a six month contract. Good to go.  Okay, Laura Shepard, Adair said, What's the book?  Slide Edge. Read it. Do 10 pages a day. It's taking me about a month.  I'll probably finish it this week. And it's phenomenal.  Okay, Adair says I just lost a $3,000 a month deal from SEO.  They hired in-house and let me go. Had that happen, my $4,000 a month.  Same thing. They're like, yeah, I can pay somebody to bring them in-house.  Okay, Porter, what's your what's your current status?  You got another client on the hook?  I got another one on the hook. I've sent him one lead so far.  I kind of put him on the back burner just because I really want to replace these two clients.  So he's still in the works. Message him.  I told him, hey, it's not personal. I'm just busy this last week.  So this week, as soon as I get some leads, going to pass them over, going to close them.  Also, I will say I was nervous to get these people on the phone because one of these clients,  the guy that was making $2,000 a year, I didn't feel like I'd send them enough leads.  Like, you know, you ever get to that point where you're like, I don't know,  because if you don't send them enough leads or you don't gain enough trust, they just won't.  There'll be objection after objection. So I was nervous.  But that Friday, I was like, and you had talked about, you're like, dude, you got to have deals on the weekend.  I was like, dude, I'm just going to send it because if they're going to say no,  I need to find somebody today and get something else rolling.  So anyways, I'm really glad that I pushed that client.  The other one, I'd send him really good leads. I was really confident in.  But this one, I was like, I don't know, it could go either way.  But I'm sure glad I did because I did send him enough leads and I felt like I communicated enough that he wanted that.  So don't be afraid. Take imperfect action because, dude, it doesn't need to be perfect.  Everybody's different.  I love that. I've sent people one.  There's people I've closed. I sent one lead.  I sent one lead. They didn't even, not only did they not close it, they didn't even quote it.  But that was enough. Guys, sometimes when you do this long enough, you start to feel it in your gut.  You start hearing things they're saying. They're really friendly with you.  They're",

So, guys, in closing, because it's eight o'clock, it's eight o'clock MST and we've got to go make some money.  I got 20 minutes with the kids and I'm back here for the next eight hours at this desk.

    "pageContent": " What is SEO and why do we do it?  So I'm gonna go very basic here and some of you that are experts and have been doing this  for a long time, just bear with me, I'm all about the fundamentals because fundamentals  wins basketball games, ask John Wooden.  Okay, so SEO, I know this is very basic but S stands for search, E stands for engine,  O stands for optimization, search engine optimization.  In layman terms, it is taking a website and getting it to the top of Google.  Okay, that's it.  Very, very simple and there are certain things that we have seen and tested and proven, at  least in theory, that they will get you to the top of Google and I say that at least  in theory because nobody really knows the answers.  This is Google that's messing with us.  Google basically gives these little breadcrumbs and says, hey, this is what we say helps but  we don't actually know if that's true and it's just a big giant game for them but here  we are, we're playing the game because this traffic that will come from SEO is worth gold.  So this is the part where we are going to turn a deal into an asset and I'll tell you  right now if you're watching this video and you're like, hey, I don't really care about  the assets, I just want to have my deal at 1000 bucks or my deal at 1500, I'm gonna spend  the $300 or $400 or $600 on ads, I'm gonna make the difference, cool, shut this part  down and keep doing deals.  However, I would highly recommend you continue these modules, you continue watching, you  continue learning, you continue growing because if we can nail this part, this is where we  can get the website to rank at the top of Google and when a website ranks at the top  of Google, we start getting what's called organic traffic.  That is traffic where people will search for Concrete Queen Creek using our example and  they will look and find our website without us having to pay for ads, they will call us  without us having to pay for ads and therefore that traffic is essentially free, those are  free leads for us so it costs us $0 to acquire and then we can turn around and be charging  that same 1000, 2000.  So the game is very simple.  We're going to use SEO, we're gonna build up the website, we're gonna use SEO and we're  gonna rank it at the top of Google and as the organic calls start to come in, it's gonna  allow us to shut down the ads little by little and our organic continues to increase and  there's gonna be this shift so every time we decrease our ads by $10, we make an extra  $10 because our price stays the same.  We make $100 so we're doing this, okay?  I highly, highly, highly recommend doing this part of the process.  This is the final piece because this is where we go from a deal to an asset.  One of the other benefits of doing SEO, of getting your website ranked is it solidifies  the deal and it mitigates our risk.  What I mean by that is if we only have leads coming in from ads, we run the risk of Google  messing with the ads and us being affected.  But if we have leads coming in from SEO and the ads, if Google messes with the ads, well  we still have the SEO leads, right?  We still have the organic leads.  So doing this is going to solidify the deal and mitigate our risk.  What I've seen in my experience is the leads that come in from SEO, the organic leads,  meaning leads that weren't paid",

I don't know if it's because the buyer, the person that's searching for that service is  a little bit more savvy and they see the ads and they go, hey, you know, that's an ad which  means that that company paid to be there, I'm gonna go and look for the organic.  I don't know.  But pound for pound I have seen that the leads that come from organic seem to be a little  higher quality and by higher quality I mean they convert a little bit better.  Again, this is just a gut thing, but I really, really like the organic leads.  Even though we don't necessarily need them, they're super, super nice to have because  again they mitigate our risk and they just allow us to sleep better at night.

    "pageContent": " Guys, let's go ahead and build our list. So hop over to the screen with me really quick.  Okay, now that we're here, what we're going to do is obviously need to open up,  hit the download, you know, open up the prospecting list template. And what I recommend doing is  having it on your Google Drive and just having the template and making a copy every time. So  that's what I've done is I made a copy of the prospecting list template and then I just name  it accordingly. So what I'll typically do is like, I'll do this for multiple cities. I'll do one of  these for like a state or a niche. So for example, this one would be, maybe I would do this one for  concrete, right? So I would do prospecting list template, concrete, niche, right? And then down  here, I would name this just a simple way to keep this straight. I do Queen Creek AZ, something like  that. You can do it however you want. I've done everything, all the above, okay? Next thing you're  going to want to do, it's very, very simple, very cut and dry, is I want you to put your keywords  in here. And again, just tying this all together, if you remember when I talked, when we talked about  the keyword list and why it's so important to have that dialed in and I really hope you guys  didn't skip that part or didn't breeze over it. But if you did that correctly, everything else  becomes easier. We use it over and over and over and over. And so hopefully you guys listen to what  I said. Take that keyword list, take your core keywords and put them in here because those are  what we're going to use to search to find these businesses. And then what's very, very simple is  if you remember when we were doing the due diligence market research, we typed in the terms  with the city. So concrete contractors, Queen Creek, concrete patio, Queen Creek,  Queen Creek concrete, yada, yada, yada. So type all of them in just like we did in the beginning.  Again, take your keywords, type them in with the city and state. And then it's really, really simple  is we're just going to start looking, okay? We're going to start looking for businesses that are  running ads. So for example, for those of you that aren't familiar with how this works,  it's going to say ad. It's going to say ad. And once in a while, you're going to see an ad here  in the, what's called the Google local listing or the Google my business or the Google business  profile or whatever it's called at the time of you seeing this video. Sometimes you'll see an ad  in here. So if there's four companies inside of this, that's because somebody's running an ad.  Okay? So pay attention to that. And what you're going to start doing is start looking for businesses  to add. Now one thing, number one, do not click on people's ads. That pisses me off when people  do it to me. And I'm just really weird about that. Don't click on people's ads. So just because you're  being lazy, don't do that. Okay? So it says, if it says the diamond solutions, what I did is I  literally went and typed in the diamond solutions.com. Okay? And you're just going to start going through  and you're going to start adding businesses to your list here. Okay? So you're going to want to  do the business name, the URL. And again, we're trying to make this easy. Keep in mind the reason  we're building this",

We could just call. So we want to make this as easy as possible. Business name, URL, reason added.  So for example, this would be like Google ads, current position. You could put where they're at  organically. Just kind of some notes, those types of things. We're going to get into a lot of this  stuff. Like for this first bit, okay? All I want you to really focus on is the business name,  the URL, why they were added. Okay? Those are the things. And in a future video, we're going to talk  about their position, their email address, their phone number, their Facebook page, notes, business  owner name, business owner Facebook profile. We're going to get into deep depth there. A little bit  of stocking, a little bit of Facebook stocking, you know what I mean? But for this one, I just want  a list of business names, URLs, reason added. So we're going to go through Google ads. We're going  to go through home advisor. We're going to go through Angie's list, et cetera. Now with Google ads,  I do want to let you guys know that you need to be careful. Because a lot of these people, they look  like, you know, for example, this person, the Diamond Solution, they are paying for ads. But  if you look at it really closely, these guys do not do residential concrete. These guys do  massive parking lots and massive parking lots are usually a referral based thing. So this is not  somebody I'm going to want to put on my list as much as I would like to. Another company that I  found, Gold Family Contractors, when you look at it, you're like, oh, it's whatever, whatever. And  then you start realizing, okay, this is a stock image, free quote. This looks a lot like a,  um, yeah, this looks a lot like a lead generation site. Oh my gosh. Um, you know, even though he's  got a picture of himself, whatever, this is actually a lead generation site. And you've  read down here, it says, tell us about your project. We connect you with trained professionals,  et cetera, et cetera. So this is a lead generation site. So I'm not going to add this one. Okay.  So you're just going to start going through, you're going to add anyone that's paying for  Google ads. It looks like a good option. Okay. And then I want to show you, um, once we get to  the home advisor stuff, what you're going to do is you're going to click on the home advisor.  Again, if they're, if home advisors running an ad, do not click on their ad. I know they suck and  I hate them too, but guys, I just, I'm a big believer in this karma thing. Don't click on  their ad and then people won't click on yours. At least that's how I feel. Okay. So if you want to  find home advisor, you're going to go to that. They're listing in the organic results, which is  really simple. Click on this. Okay. And they're just going to, you're going to start seeing, uh,  people in this. Now, one thing to be really, really careful of is to make sure number one,  it's the right niche. So for example, this darling house is, it says something, lift my house. This  is probably a, it is",

Looks like  I'm searching a lot. So I think I'm a robot. Okay. J and B construction. This looks like a real  company. Let's go ahead and look at their website though. First. Okay. Okay. These guys, Arizona  based full, full service contractor. Yeah. These guys look like they do a lot more than just  concrete, which is fine. But a lot of times when they're doing more than just concrete,  you are going to have people, they don't, they don't want the concrete. They want,  they want the whole job. So this isn't really someone I'm going to, I'm going to hold on that  one. I'm going to keep looking Arizona foundation solutions. Again, that's the foundation company.  No, thank you. McDowell landscaping. Okay. Perfect. That would be somebody that would be  interesting. They're, they're a landscaping company. So I'll check them out and guys,  take your time. Treat these like these are people you're going to be working with for a while.  Now, one thing to note here, McDowell, look at their, their deal here. If you're wondering like,  Oh, does this company actually cover this area? It does say, you know, McDowell landscaping in  Queen Creek. So it does cover there, but make sure it's in the right area. Again, this also  kind of looks to me, this puts off a little bit of a, of a lead generation vibe. So here's what I  want to tell you guys. Okay. I want you to look for lead generation companies, be aware of them,  but if, when in doubt, pick up the phone and go like this 480-878-9569. Okay. We're going to call  them. Okay. So I have a weird area code. I'm sure that's why I answered. He did say Mike McDowell.  So he's a real company. This looks like a real company to me. I'm seeing a lot of stuff about  Queen Creek. This to me looks like a real company. The only thing I would be hesitant of is making  sure that they actually did concrete. So what I'll probably do is I'll text them and say,  Hey, do you guys do patios and driveways? Okay. And you'll probably call me back,  but I want to make sure. So this is somebody I would add. Okay. And so what I would do here is  I would add it's McDowell landscaping. You got to be a little bit careful because a lot of these  guys, they just want like specific type of jobs, especially in this market. But what I'm going to  do here is I'm going to put, you know, okay, I'm going to put the McDowell McDowell landscaping,  and then I'm going to put home advisor. Boom. Okay. So I'm just making a list. Okay. And again,  we're going to be coming back and also why you're, while you're here, what I would say  is grab the phone number so you don't have to come back. So you're",

    "pageContent": "already on the site.  Do grab the phone number. And if you see an email, grab it, don't go searching too hard,  but grab the phone number so you don't have to come back to the website. So there's the phone  number and he said, and also he said Mike McDowell. So I'm just going to write it down  because he said it in his voicemail. So no reason to track that down later. So anyway,  we're just going to start building the list. Again, use your intuition.  Um, look for lead generators, look for people that, um, you know, they're not in your area.  That's one big thing that I've noticed is, and they're going to be in California.  They didn't check the setting that says, you know, to not show them other places. You click  on their thing. They're actually in San Francisco and they're running ads in it in Arizona. It's  ridiculous, but it happens. And then when in doubt, I think the biggest thing I would say is just  when in doubt, just call, just call and ask, say, Hey Mike, this is, uh, this is Nick. Just curious.  Do you guys cover Queen Creek? Okay. Cool. Um, was curious. Do you also do, um, do you do flat  work? Do you do patios and driveways, that kind of thing? Okay. Awesome. Well, I have, you know,  you can say whatever I have client, like you don't need to pitch them right there. In fact,  I would recommend you don't pitch them right there, but you say, okay, sounds good. I'll give  you a call back. Let me talk to my spouse. Something very, very simple. But what I want  you guys to do is I want you to start off and I want you to have, I want you to start building a  list of people and my, as I said in a previous video, get as many people as you possibly can  from Google ads and then go to home advisor and then goes to Angie's list, et cetera, et cetera,  et cetera. And in the next videos, we're going to talk about what happens if you can't find a bunch  of people running Google ads? What happens if you can't find a bunch of people running, um,  advertising on these different platforms? What do you do then?",

And Mike V is at $40,000 a month, and he just posted his Stripe screenshot in I think it  was the free group, which I really appreciated.  And because I know sometimes it's scary to share, I know sometimes you think, dude, what  are people going to say?  What are they, you know, it's not even what they think, but what are they going to say?  And if you're not the braggy type, then maybe they're going to think I'm like that.  And so I do appreciate it because I think you'd be surprised how much people really  get inspired by those posts, way more people get inspired than get jealous.  And the people that get jealous are going to just blame the program or me or everything  else and quit anyway.  So it doesn't matter.  But Mike V is at $40,000 USD per month.  And I just want to ask him questions personally about how he got there, what he's doing.  And like, these aren't to fill time.  These are like genuine questions.  So I just want to basically jump right in.  Aaron, I'm going to let you ask any questions you have, I'm going to let you also, if you  guys have questions, start dropping them in the comments, I'm going to have Aaron kind  of moderate when there are questions that when we get to the end.  So Mike V, in 42 minutes, I'm going to let you off the stream.  If you can give us 42 minutes, I would appreciate that.  And we're just going to get through as much as we can.  Is that cool?  100%.  Beautiful.  First and foremost, you guys need to follow Mike V on his Instagram page.  He has two.  And he just followed me on his like business one.  He has some really amazing content ideas.  And by the way, I just saw the most awesome post you made where someone is massaging your  head while you were working and you had someone who touched your feet and like he based it  like six.  I don't even know what what nationality these girls were, but you just look like a king,  dude.  Yeah, it's it's one of the hacks is when you when you're printing, when you make money,  you got the massage, you get a foot massage, you get someone doing your head and you're  just sitting there, you know, checking strike balances, doing SEO makes for a good experience.  Dude, if you're not checking SEO and eating like some type of exotic fruit, you're you're  really not living, you know.  For sure.  That's a good time over here in Thailand for sure.  But yeah, I think things have moved pretty quick this year.  It's been good.  What's your Instagram, bro?  I want to guys, I'm serious.  You guys should get inspired by what this guy is doing.  And yeah, what's your Instagram, your personal or that one or whatever one?  People should follow you should check out what you're doing because this guy is making  moves and he's just getting started.  So what is it?  And then I'll have or I can even have Aaron go go to Instagram, find Mike V and just share  share his link.  I'll do that for you.  Oh, he already did it.  Marcus, we understand the chat.  There you go.  Beautiful.  Beautiful.  OK, you can drop me a photo there to see what",

We've already interviewed you before, so I'm not going to backpedal too much.  But just real quick, tell us when you started and where you're living right now.  When I started digital landlords.  Yeah, when you started the program, I know that you had a little bit of digital  marketing experience. Yeah.  Just when did you start in here?  I started in digital landlords about 26 months ago and I'm currently in in Thailand.  Can you guys still see me?  Yeah, you're back. Can you hear me?  Yeah, yeah.  That we cut out for a second.  OK, we're good. OK, I heard 20.  You said 26 months.  Yeah, 26 months in digital landlords.  At that time, I was back home in my corporate job and we're in Bangkok now.  OK, beautiful.  So that's just to give a little bit of a of a backdrop.  So basically a little bit over two years.  So here's the first question.  Go ahead, go ahead.  Yeah, two two years in digital landlords.  OK. That's crazy, bro.  I was in programs for four years and I was barely scratching 8000 a month.  So I admire people like you, Ryan Dalton, like that.  You guys are able to pick this up so quickly.  I'm the type of person that just takes a long time to learn stuff.  So I love it, dude.  OK, so remind me, because I don't remember when we talked last time,  did this did it click for you right away or did it take you some time?  I know I do remember you getting to 10K relatively quickly,  but like, did that very first deal?  And I'm saying that for the people that just started, like, did it click quickly?  And if so, why do you think that was?  It clicked pretty quickly compared to what I was doing for the previous four years,  because I was trying to figure out how to make money online for four years.  And I was making a thousand dollars a month for four years.  And then I joined the program and I just worked as hard as I could.  And it clicked pretty quick.  I mean, it was pretty tough up until the first deal.  Just trying to believe in it and, you know, having the faith and everything.  But I just, you know, read the book, the Thinking Grow Rich book.  And, you know, once that first deal got over the line,  it was pretty smooth sailing from there.  Like you said, you just need to repeat it, you know, eight more times  or 40 more times or whatever you want.  Why? How long did it take you to get your first deal?  I think it was four or five weeks.  OK, that's maybe six.  I think five.  That's good.  But it's not like, you know, you've got some guys like a week or two weeks.  Like, that's good.  But it's not like overly like that's doable.  It's repeatable for anyone that gets in.  Like, you know what I mean?  Like anybody could come in and get a deal in five, six weeks.  So that this is what I'm trying to figure out.  And the reason I'm having you on, dude, is like,  I'm trying to figure out why it is that some people are so successful.  And why some people",

But you're at 40K and there's people at zero that are blaming everybody else.  Why do you think there's people out there that have been in for 90 days,  you know, six months and have no deals?  I think they might be comfortable, you know, not kind of want it bad enough.  I remember when I joined, I was already going to quit my job  and and leave the country and, you know, pursue my dreams.  So my back was against the wall.  So I don't really have a choice but to make it happen.  And I knew I knew really deeply what I actually wanted,  like from digital landlords, I knew that it was going to be the avenue  to live the life that I have now.  So I think just understanding exactly why  they'll get you through like the trench phase,  because there's a trench phase to every type of business model  and everything you do, like whether it's learning to ride a bike, close deals.  You have to get through that trench phase.  And that's basically impossible  unless you have like a  why and perhaps like forcing yourself to do it.  And if I wasn't going to quit my job, I probably wouldn't have worked as hard  because I knew, you know, I've still got my my paycheck coming in.  So you don't have an element of risk, I think, to go.  So how do people that because I do know what you're saying.  And essentially what how I interpret that is like when people are  I swear comfort is the scariest thing ever.  Right. Because when you're comfortable, you don't want to do  you don't want to move because it's like you're just  it's like being in your freaking bed and it's cold outside.  Like you're just you're you're you're just content.  You're just laying in those sheets and it feels so good.  But you know, you're going to feel regret and you know,  you're going to feel these things.  But it's so hard to get out because you're comfortable.  So how do you like?  You know, I'm kind of like you, bro, I think, because for me,  that sounds like you had already made up your mind  that you're going to quit your job.  You're going to go pursue your dreams.  That's just what was going to happen.  And so you're going to force yourself to make it happen  because you're going to make yourself uncomfortable.  What do other people do, bro, that aren't that type,  that they're not the type that's going to go quick  because I did that same kind of a thing.  I just kind of quit what I was doing before.  And I'm like, well, I have to figure this out.  So but maybe they're not everyone's that type.  That terrifies people.  Do you think there's a way that people that aren't that type,  that are comfortable right now in a job, in whatever,  that they can force that discomfort without, like, completely just,  you know, throwing caution to the wind?  Yeah. You know what I mean?  Yeah, for sure.  I don't recommend everyone does the same approach I did,  you know, especially if you've got family or something like that  or other commitments.  But I mean, I'm teaching a couple of people,  local business, lead generation myself.  Some of them are in fairly comfortable positions, ",

And I think what works for those people  is kind of setting goals for yourself each week  and having, like, a bit of a timeline to make your first,  you know, $2,000 to $5,000.  And then once you break that down into, like, weekly KPIs  or things that you need to tick off,  you know, at the end of the week and say,  hey, did I do it or did I not do it?  And I think it just comes down to discipline  as well as a bit of that mindset training as well.  And I'm sure you're still telling people  to read that Think and Grow Rich book.  So I think a combination of, yeah, your mindset  and having the discipline with, like, a set goal,  that's what I'd recommend  instead of just throwing caution to the wind, perhaps.  Okay. I'm writing notes, dude.  And I'm not, again, I hope you can tell,  I have all these questions,  but I'm genuinely, like, having this conversation  like we're just sitting there having the conversation  because I would love, I'm trying to extract  out of your brain how we can,  and sometimes it's hard because for me,  I just do it a lot of times.  And so sometimes it's hard for me to relate to other people  because I've always thrown caution to the wind, dude.  When I got my first sales job,  it was door to door, 100% commission,  with a baby on the way, I was recently married,  I had no money coming in and I was like, yeah, sign me up.  I can make, what's the potential?  What's the best guy?  What was the best guy in the company last year?  They said 90 grand.  Okay, awesome.  So that's the, I can make at least 90 grand.  Okay, sign me up.  I know I'm as good as that guy.  And that's just how I think.  And I quit my job and we moved across the country  and I made it work.  When I started this business, I bought a program  and I stopped doing that job to do this.  And I just, sometimes I find it hard to relate  and I don't know how to tell people  to make themselves uncomfortable because they just,  they're just gonna die in their discomfort, I feel like.  Aaron, do you have anything you wanna add on this?  Because Aaron is, dude,  this is one of the sharpest kids I've ever met.  Very persistent, by the way.  One of these days we're gonna go live  on how persistent this guy is.  Aaron, anything you wanna add on this?  No, I mean, I think you're right on, Mike.  It seems like we always do the thing we desire most  in the moment and just we live life  generally choosing comfort.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  And- Yeah, for sure.  And we trade temporary comfort for future regret,  which is scary.  I don't know.  I think I'd add on that,  just thinking about how to put early,  putting yourself in financial stress  or family stress or whatever is,  just having a true understanding  of the shortness of life.  And I was reading a lot of stock philosophy  leading up to joining the group  and also going home with the travel side  and actually kind of meditating on that a bit  and just pondering the short life  can motivate you in a way of, for me is like,  there's so much to explore in",

And you can't really appreciate that  until you kind of understand that,  hey, we only really have 80 years here.  So that's another way to kind of motivate yourself  to work harder.  Yeah.  This is a personal question.  You said you would already made up your mind  to quit your job and chase your dreams, right?  Yeah.  What are your dreams?  What is it that you,  because I think people are either motivated  by they're running away from something they're scared of  or they're running towards something that they want.  What are your dreams that you wanted to quit your job  and use this to achieve?  I think you should do it now,  but training Muay Thai, waking up whenever I want.  I ride my scooter through the mountains  to the beach every day.  Got a pool villa with a nice blue pool in it.  I'm hanging out with other guys doing the same thing.  Now I don't have to go to my corporate office  and like sacrifice my authenticity.  You know, I don't have to live in anyone else's shadow  and do stuff that's inauthentic,  which I think can just impact the quality of your life.  When you have to go to a job that you don't like  and supplicate to a boss, like it chips away your soul.  And I'm living my dreams now, so I'm happy as.  That's sick, dude.  So you're living in Thailand.  You basically every day you wake up when you want  and then you, how many times a week are you going  to the beach through the mountains on a scooter?  Every day I drive into Starbucks,  get a coffee, hang out with some friends  and I still work extremely hard.  I think last month I worked 30 days straight,  just because I was so excited about the business  and I had a lot of momentum going.  That's crazy, bro.  I love stories like that.  Stories like yours, they are inspiring  because it's like you are literally,  it's like you're like literally living  the Tim Ferriss 40 hour work week,  not necessarily that's how much you work,  but like just the, you're doing, is it called Muay Thai?  Yeah, Muay Thai, yeah.  I love it, bro.  Had my first fight recently, which was fun.  Yeah, tell us about that.  How did you do, bro?  Yeah, good, it was, I mean, I've always done Muay Thai,  I've always liked combat sports  and I was like, hey, I've got free time now.  Like, yeah, so I signed up for a fight, super nervous,  but I was like, hey, let's, you know, the fight's signed,  we've got to train hard now, we've got to prepare for war  and, you know, because I had digital landlords,  I had all my money coming in,  I was able to train twice a day,  I was working like an hour or two,  just keeping the lights on and had the fight,  went well, no injuries and got the win.  So that was an awesome moment this year as well.  That's crazy, I love that, dude.  Yeah, there was a student that we had on,  his name is, I think it's Jordan,  and I remember something that he said,  we were talking about, he was talking about  some of the stuff he wants to do with his son and stuff  and he was talking about this mountain  that",

And it's just insane that like,  there's so many things to do,  so many places to see,  so many like problems to solve,  people to meet, experiences to have,  foods to taste, cultures to experience  and all it is is on the other side  of like just doing the freaking boring work  of what we have in front of us.  It's, I mean, you're an example of it, bro.  What like, what was your life like 27 months ago?  The trenches, I was working 40 hours a week.  I was working two hours after work on the business,  on the side business, on the hobby, you know, at the time.  I was training an hour a day in the gym,  so I was flat out, I only had Sundays off just to recover  and then we'd be straight back in the trenches  and like those are the points I look back on  and kind of like revere and like whole daily,  like sitting at the desk,  like looking out the window and like,  sitting at the desk and looking out the window,  just like dreaming of just an absolute trenches  but like enjoying it, like, you know,  knowing that it was gonna work out  because all of the work that,  all of the mindset stuff and think and grow rich,  that's such a massive part of it.  And especially it is hard at the start  when you don't have that mindset  or you don't have other people around you who are doing it.  But I think just listen to your advice  and jumping on the live calls and just like embracing it.  Look at there in the end.  I think going back to what we talked about  with like discomfort,  you know, one way I've found to make yourself uncomfortable  is purposely putting yourself around people  that are playing at such a higher level than you.  That you will feel uncomfortable  because you know, you're gonna see that like  for them to go and buy a brand new Range Rover  or a brand new G wagon tomorrow cash is an afterthought  or to book a charter, a jet to go down to Mexico  for three days and spend 20 grand is just something  that you decide to do over a drink one night.  And you're like, oh my gosh,  if I'm gonna keep being friends with these people,  I gotta start being like playing a different game  because if I get invited to these things,  I can't be the guy that's like,  dude, what's the price of the jet?  You know what I mean?  So I think one thing that we can do  to force that discomfort is get around people  at a higher level of very, a much higher level than us.  And it makes us, it kind of makes us realize  just how small we're playing compared to other people.  Do you know what I'm saying?  Yeah, a hundred percent.  I mean, eight to 10 weeks after joining your landlords,  I was on around 10K a month.  And I was cruising on about 10K a month for about a year,  like traveling around a bit.  And it got pretty lonely just traveling by yourself.  So I joined like a bit of a network  of like other entrepreneurs.  And like Nick says, like a lot of them  were making some great money,  like much more than myself.  And just",

And that was actually a key part  because at the start of this year  is when I joined that group,  when I was on 10K and then fast forward,  nine months later, we're on 40,000.  So I attribute most of this year's success  to almost all of it, to that group of people.  And even the converse, and I agree, bro.  And even the conversations,  the way that they talk about things,  like I've recently kind of like formed this relationship  with this guy and it's like, just the,  it's like casually like, oh, I'm gonna buy a house.  This guy in Dubai, you know, I think I'm gonna,  he has, I don't know,  I think it's like 14 places here in Dubai.  And he just wanted to buy a villa.  And he wanted to buy a villa.  And there wasn't a budget.  It was just what's the villa that we want.  And I started like to dig in a little bit.  And it was like, and he ended up getting one.  And it was like, it was like 6 million or 7 million.  It was just cash, no loan, no nothing.  And you're like, okay, that's cool, man.  I like, it's just, it's the game is levels.  And you just start going, oh my gosh,  this guy's so much more,  he's doing so much more than me financially.  I gotta keep up.  So anyway, for those of you that are sitting there  going, I feel comfortable.  And I don't know what to do  because I'm making $15,000 a month.  Guys, that is a lot compared to, you know,  your brother that works at Starbucks.  That's great.  But like 15,000 a month,  I don't know how people live on 15,000 a month  that have a family.  And I don't mean that being at all condescending.  I'm genuinely saying like when you look at gas  and if you have a pool and you're paying to heat the pool  and the pool guy and the vacation,  I mean, dude, you can't live on 15.  I don't know how you live on 15 grand.  And I know people that are living on like four grand.  So those of you that are uncomfortable,  one thing that you could try  is getting around other people  than your same friends that you go and, you know,  do, you know, whatever drink on,  at the bowling alley on a Wednesday, whatever.  So, okay, two more questions for me,  three more questions.  And then I wanna go to Q&A.  Mike, these are just random.  And I wanna know this because I swear to you,  I'm trying to like,  I'm asking everybody these questions.  And so they're really kind of out there,  but I'm just, I'm curious.  And there's no wrong answer.  There's no right answer.  But it just, I'm gonna keep asking these questions  because I'm trying to find commonalities.  But are you a spiritual and or religious person  or would you consider yourself neither of those things?  Yeah, definitely.  And open to religion.  I think agnostic's the word.  Definitely believe in some sort of high purpose  or something, you know,  that we can't quite perceive in the",

Yeah, there's no, it's just, I'm observing,  I'm looking at other things because, you know,  you see things, you're like, oh yeah,  all the people I know that are successful,  they do these, but these are things that are like,  I'm just curious.  Other thing I'm curious about is,  do you, are you actively involved with your time  or money in any kind of like a charity at this point,  or is it something that you plan on doing in the future  or is it just like not something on your radar  that doesn't make you a good or bad person?  I'm just curious.  I don't have any charities,  but I always tip like very, very heavily.  Excuse me.  You know, especially at the villa,  like you've got people cleaning the pool,  people are coming through like plan maintenance,  people come clean and like,  I always tip like, you know, a really good amount.  That's cool.  And that's not only to kind of give back to people  with less opportunity,  but also just building like an abundance mindset  when it comes to money.  And it's funny how it works  is when you start tipping more and like giving more,  you know, deals just landed on your lap,  money is just comes to you.  And yeah, I think that's a charity  in whatever sense it is, it's really good.  You can't be stingy or you can't be scarce with money  because you maintain that reality if it is in your mind.  You know, it's funny.  You guys, I don't know, maybe you do, maybe you don't,  but the guy that does all of our YouTube videos,  he's also a student inside here named Isaac.  He's 21, 22, I think, maybe he's 22, maybe he's 23.  I don't know, he's young.  He taught me something and it pisses me off  that I had to learn this from him  because I always just, I kind of treat him  like little brother, you know, I would kind of rough him up.  But this one day we went to this gym,  we were down in California and we went to this gym,  like we did like a late gym session  because we went to Disneyland and he'd never been  and my family went and I invited him,  went to Disneyland and me and him decided  to go to the gym at like 11.  And he went and bought like a energy drink before the gym  because we were so tired, he bought like a whatever.  And you know, when you buy something  or you go to a restaurant, asks for a tip, right?  He tipped more than the drink.  It was like a $4 drink and he tipped or the same.  It's like five bucks, he tipped five.  And dude, he came over and he was like,  he told me about it, he's like,  you should have seen how happy this guy was.  He was like, thank you so much, bro.  And this kid, I'm like, what?  Why would you tip the, he didn't do anything for you, bro.  Why would you tip on that?  Because I always used to get pissed  when it would be like, you know, do you tip?  And he taught me that he's like,  dude, I always choose the most.  And I'm like, you're stupid, dude.  And I was like, all right, I'm gonna",

If I'm on my DoorDash or like in Dubai,  it's called Deliveroo or if I'm at a restaurant,  I always choose the highest amount.  Like if it's like five, seven or 20,  I choose 20 every time.  And I swear sometimes I hesitate cause I'm like,  oh, that's like, especially if it's like $500 bill,  you're like, I just spent an extra whatever, 100 bucks.  I swear to you, there's something about it though,  that if you are, you know, abundant,  then abundance flows to you.  It's crazy.  It's, I don't know.  I don't know how to explain it.  It's like when you go to his tech to the 20 bucks,  for example, like when you go through with it,  it's, you're basically telling yourself,  I know I'm implausible because I know more money's coming.  And that's, that changes the whole way you operate.  When you're on sales call, it's like you're more relaxed.  When you're doing your due diligence,  you're more motivated.  And just touching with the DoorDash,  on the DoorDash, we have Grab here in Thailand.  And this dude rocked up a couple of days ago,  delivering the morning coffee.  He's like freshly broke his hand.  You know, and he's driving his bike.  He gets off his bike and he hands me the coffee.  And I'm like, whoa, this is a poor fellow right here.  And he's still in the trenches, you know, grinding.  And then he came back another week later.  I tipped him 20 bucks, like the max I could in the app.  Then he came back the next week  and he showed me his doctor's certificate.  And I was like, man,  there's some really unfortunate people,  but this guy's still out here, like, you know,  putting food on his family's table.  It's in the way that, yeah, anyway, it's so true, bro.  So anyway, you guys don't have to do that.  But for me, I found that it's like a big thing.  So kind of out there a bit, but it's true.  So, okay, dude, let's get into some Q&A.  I'm gonna ask this last question  and I'm gonna have Aaron kind of like,  be the person that kind of coordinates all the Q&A,  so I don't have to look at it.  But the question that I'm having coming into this,  and I'm just gonna ask it to you  because it's the question I'm trying to like,  think of the, I'm thinking about this the entire time  and this is why I wanted you on this call.  But like, how can we help students in this program  inside of this group replicate your success?  Is it something that we can do,  like my team, me, Aaron, Ashley, Isaac,  and I'm sure it's a combination of both,  and if so, what?  Is it on the students, like how,  dude, what can we, I wish I just knew the answer  and we could do that thing.  I'm trying to extract like how in the world  do we get people to have even a quarter of your success  to just go and do it because there's no reason,  if Mike's at 40,000 in two years per month, US,  why do you guys, why do some of you not",

    "pageContent": "have a deal?  I don't get it, I don't get it.  So Mike, how do we replicate your success, dude?  Yeah, I think everything's, I think everything's there,  like, you know, I did a bit of marketing before I joined  and I was going through the course  with like a beginner's mindset  and just following everything exactly as training suggested  and I think the training's perfect.  You know, you follow it enough times,  you're gonna get deals.  I think a big part of the training  that maybe people neglect in place of the technical stuff  like the SCR and due diligence is just the mindset side,  the think and grow rich book that you recommended  and some of the goal setting, you know,  like how many cold calls are you gonna have to do  to hit your $5,000 a month target  or whatever your target is?  And if you don't have your target,  then you need to set a target.  And when you mentioned Tim Ferriss's for our work week,  the first chapter of that is D for definition,  which is to actually define your ideal life  and you might be surprised at how many deals you need.  You only need, you may only need two,  I only need one or two deals  to live my dream life at the start  because that was the price of three meals, a scooter,  you know, a cheap villa in Thailand.  So that's what I would suggest.  I love that.  And just so everybody knows,  we know that we can make improvements  and Aaron kind of alluded to that at the beginning.  There are some massive, we're gonna be,  by the way, we are in the planning stages of redoing  to version 3.0, the training.  And without giving too much away,  we have some really, really interesting stuff.  So just know that we know that like we can improve.  It's not like there's not things that we can do better.  The fact of the matter is though,  that with the exact same training  that is currently available,  Mike has managed to get to $40,000 USD per month  while also fighting and training for a fight,  while also riding his scooter to the beach every day,  while also getting head massages  while he's checking his stride.  Let's not forget about that.  So anyway, bro.  Dude, it's been-  Send the picture for the group.  Yeah, send that picture.  You should post that picture, by the way.  That's an epic.  I saw that on your story and I was like,  I love that story.  That's a really good story you posted.  So I wanna get into a little bit of Q&A,  but I do just wanna first before we go in the last 10 minutes,  just thank you for coming on  because I know your time is super valuable.  $40,000 per month, guys, his time is worth a lot.  And so I hope you guys listen to what he's saying.  And I've heard you say a couple of things.  You've repeated a couple of things,  which I've made a note of here.  And you've inspired me to go and reread Think and Grow Rich  for the third or fourth time,  even though I was probably the one that tried to get you  to do it in the beginning when you watched the training.  But you've mentioned that a couple of times,  which has got me thinking, you know what?  I really should dig back into that.  What a powerful book.  So I hope you guys are listening to Mike.  He is somebody, if",

Or what is he, as Hermosy always talks about,  what is he not doing that I am doing?  And go do that.  It's extremely simple.  Yeah, that's a huge part of getting from the 10 to the 40  and beyond is, what are you not doing?  Like you say, in the YouTube videos,  it's simplification, just focusing on ranking rent only.  Say no to everything else at the right time.  And focusing on the one thing is how you're gonna really  scale this business.  And to be honest, like today I worked a couple of hours.  I've got 38 active retainers.  And I literally got not much to do.  It's all systematized.  That's because I'm focusing on one thing.  Beautiful, bro.  It's beautiful.  Get good at one thing.  Get good at doing a thousand dollar a month  flat fee Legion deal in four or five niches  and doing it again and again and again and again and again.  And you're gonna get rich.  That's it.  So Aaron, let's bust a couple of questions for Mike  if there's any in the chat.  Yeah, we got some good ones.  So Daniel said, Mike, if you had to restart,  how fast would you get back to 40K?  So assuming like knowing now what you know,  like how fast you think you could scale or?  At the moment, I've probably got about five active deals  in my pipeline, my hair table.  So I'm probably closing a new retainer every week.  So about 40 weeks, I'd get back to 40K.  Yeah, that's awesome.  And I would probably add that Mike would probably do that  while maintaining the exact same lifestyle  that he's got right now.  I'm seeing everything systematized.  If you're only around 10K and you're looking to get to 40K,  I definitely recommend a good book.  It's called Systemology.  I've never really been like a super organized guy,  but Systemology has made systematizing the business  like extremely easy.  I recommend that to everyone.  Beautiful, I'm gonna write that down.  Awesome, I'll put that, cool, I'll put that in the chat.  Yeah, and then Kirk Clark says,  and then Kirk Clark says, where are your customers?  Is it U.S. or is it Australia?  Yeah, so all my customers,  pretty much all my clients are in New Zealand.  I've got two in Australia,  and the time difference is about five hours.  So I still wake up at 10 a.m. my time,  which is like five o'clock in New Zealand,  but we're the ones sitting on digital gold,  so that'd be good fun.  But I thought you couldn't do this outside the U.S.  So you have most of your clients in New Zealand,  not Australia, right?  Because you're from New Zealand.  Yeah, dude.  Yeah, weird.  I didn't know you could do this in other countries.  Weird.  Just kidding.  I honestly didn't know that New Zealand was such a market.  That's awesome.  That's great.  I thought it was just like, honestly,  me and the Australian in the U.S., but that's great.  That's sick, dude.  That's sick.  Keep going.

And he says, by the way,  I've got pretty similar goal in mind  with the Muay Thai mastery,  whatever combat sports you're in.  You're really inspiring.  Thanks for the nuggets you dropped so far.  So I guess kind of how you structure to move the needle.  Yes, we do.  Thanks for the compliment on inspiration.  In terms of moving the needle,  I honestly don't have too much structure in my business.  Like my whole mindset is just wake up  and like get in the trenches basically,  but that being said, where I'm at now with the business,  what actually got me from 10 to 40 was,  what does 40K and Mike do?  What does 40K and Mike do?  And I literally embodied that at the start of the year  while everyone was partying for New Year's.  I was reading books on productivity  and it took nine months to catch up with the actions  in terms of hitting the 40K a month goal.  Some key parts of that were also getting my CRM dialed in.  So I've got to thank Ben Van Harten in the group.  He's actually in digital business in Thailand.  So getting your CRM sorted,  that's extremely important.  Getting your lead reporting sorted,  getting some sort of system to look at your prospecting deals  and obviously how many leads your current clients are getting.  And I'm going to thank Ryan Dalton.  He's actually an integral part of the business  in terms of outsourcing some of my web builds  and also his RankinRent engine system.  I wouldn't be here without that.  Beautiful.  And as a teaser,  the version 2.0 of Ryan's RankinRent engine  is very close to being completed.  So more to come on that.  Anyway, keep going.  Yeah, we got some really good comments here.  I'll just mainly go to the questions,  but we got some really cool comments  and a lot of people appreciate what you're saying, Mike.  So thanks a lot for hopping on.  Matthew, he kind of has like a similar question.  He says, yeah, like, what do you do?  What does your week look like in terms of delegating tasks  for grabbing deals?  And I mean, I guess I can just say,  probably put in the way you got to 40K  was by selling $40,000 worth of deals.  So obviously that sales part.  So I'll personally ask, like,  do you still do the closing calls  and like, have you outsourced everything  about the sales or?  So the only thing I'm outsourcing at the moment  is the SEO builds, the SEO website builds.  And I've got a guy that does all my blogging  and I think he employs his cousins in the Philippines.  So yeah, I mean, I'm on 40,000 USD a month  and I don't have a big team.  I haven't got a huge bill of people that I have to pay.  The profit margins are pretty good.  I've got my Google ads bill and then I've got maybe  three to $4,000 of blog post costs  and outsourcing to Ryan's team.  And in six months, those costs,  the profit margins are gonna be even bigger.  So yeah, I'm pretty proud of the fact  that I only have one person that I really outsource to  and the rest is just on autopilot.  So are you still handling all the sales yourself,  like the prospecting and the setup and the close?  Yeah, so I still do all",

But yeah, we'll see if I need to employ some more people  to get to $66,000 in a month.  But I think the way that everything's set up  and systematized and automated,  I think I'll be able to get to $66,000  without having to figure out building a team,  more of a team.  That's awesome, bro.  We got just like one more question.  Nathan, guys, he put in the link to the book.  So thank you for that for systematology, systemology.  Oh, we got two quick questions  and then you can just fire these.  So Jared said, is your technical SEO team  in Thailand with you?  So it sounds like you just got that one guy.  Yeah, so we're a team in the Philippines.  Just one guy doing the blogs with his cousins  and a bit of WordPress work.  Cool, so that's the other.  Did you get them?  Oh, sorry, I was gonna say,  did you get them on onlinejobs.ph  or where'd you find that guy?  Yeah, onlinejobs.ph.  I've been with him for eight months.  He's amazing.  I definitely recommend onlinejobs.ph  for outsourcing really respectful people  with good English and if you treat them well,  they treat you well.  That's awesome, man.  Yeah, we just got one more question.  Nathan says, and I know this depends on  if you ask this question now,  or like you said, in six months,  once a lot of your sites rank,  but how much of the 40K per month is profit?  Just about.  About 60, 65%.  Wow, that's awesome.  Yeah, I'm ranking these sites really fast  thanks to Ryan's team,  and the way they set everything up.  So I'm able to like reduce the ad spins pretty quickly.  And guys, just to add to that real quick,  if Mike were to take everything in-house  and do it all himself and be a solopreneur,  apart from the ad costs that he has,  I bet he would be closer to 70, 72, 75% profit margin,  but he's doing exactly what I did,  which is he's building out a team.  He's got people doing content.  He's scaling it,  and he's also got an incredible lifestyle.  So you can do this as much,  like he's doing it smart.  So yeah, he's got a 55% profit.  Let's say he's bringing in, what is it?  22, $23,000 in his pocket every single month,  quarter million bucks.  That's his money,  but he doesn't have to do jack shit.  That's why he's fighting Muay Thai fights, right?  And that's the beauty of the entire thing.  Some of you guys are so scared to get somebody  because, oh, I'm gonna have a recurring cost,  and I gotta, good, just go replace it.  Your content person right now,  I'm sure you, I don't know, maybe,  how long have you had that person?  He's had eight months.  So you've had them since the time  you were probably at 25,000,  and you probably added one or two of his cousins,  but you guys, we're trying to scale this thing.  We're not just trying to keep every dollar in our pocket  and do all",

So I'm investing and taking over the Google board  and getting these sites,  just printing money every week on all their partners.  By the way.  I put in the work, ranking them.  I love that you call it the Google board.  I heard that on one of your videos  and I was like, I like that.  It sounds like it's like an interesting way  to say it, the Google board.  The monopoly board.  I'm still running the same sales script,  telling them it's the monopoly board and they love it.  I know exactly what you mean.  I just have never heard it called the Google board  and it makes total sense,  and it's kind of a fun way to say it.  So anyway, just kind of just a side note.

And everybody please give Mike a thanks for jumping on  and spending his time.  Dude, when are you gonna hit?  What's the goal to hit the 50?  Like, so a thousand, you're doing about a deal a week.  So what, in about 90 days, roughly?  Yeah, I want to get to a hundred thousand New Zealand dollars  where we'll get there.  And I think that's about 66,000 USD.  And I think after that,  I'm just gonna be focusing a bit more on  traveling more around the world  and getting a bit more systematization done.  I love that, bro.  Unbelievable.  It's unbelievable that we, I don't know.  Do you ever get this way sometimes you wake up  and you're like, dude, I'm literally selling air.  Like you guys have seen the Lorax, right?  Have you guys seen the Lorax, that movie?  Yeah, a while back.  You don't have to, if you haven't,  but you should watch it.  It's hilarious.  A Dr. Seuss movie.  And the guy, that little short guy,  the something O'Hare, I don't know his first name.  He's a little short guy with the most amazing haircut.  He sells air.  Like he's literally like polluting the air  and selling it back to him.  But I always am like, dude,  I swear it's like we're selling air.  Like we're just giving these people the,  but it's also a valuable service because  like you could argue, well, if you didn't do this,  then they would get, no, they wouldn't get the leads.  The leads would go to the home advisors  and the Angie's list and the big guys.  We're fighting between the little guys.  So no, just because we're in there  doesn't mean those leads would go to them.  That's not true at all.  We're taking the leads from the big guys.  We're partnering with the little guys  and we're helping them do business.  So I joke about us selling air  because it",

    "pageContent": " Board. Okay, guys, welcome to officially welcome to our call  today. It is the beautiful month of October 29, two days away  from Halloween. We are almost in the second to last month before  this beautiful year ends. For some of you guys, that's a very  exciting thing, because you're gonna love to close the door on  this, this year. And some of you guys have had the year of your  life. And maybe that's not the case. But time is actually  flying. Lots happened this year, a lot of money's been made, a  lot of money's been lost, I'm sure. And here we are. That's  it's actually crazy. Also, I think I might have said this. But  guys, this is just a quick thing I want to say, get creative with  everything you're doing in your business, you need to let people  know what it is that you do. Porter, I told you what we're  doing for Halloween. No. So what we decided to do because one  of my friends, his father in law has this massive, actually an  orthodontist practice. So maybe you could take this to your  wife's family. But it's a great idea. So what they do every  single year on Halloween is instead of giving out candy, they  give out freaking toothbrushes branded with the company. And I  thought I was thought that was genius. Because think about this  500 1000 kids, they're they're dumping their brand in their  home and these toothbrushes are just floating around their house  for the next 365 days. So I was I was like, that's really,  really smart. So this year, because I keep saying I'm going  to do it, I keep saying I'm going to do it. This year, I  went ahead, and I made, like, to well, I don't think it was 650  of these things, I made $2,000 worth of Rubik's cubes, branded  with digital landlords. They're pretty dope, dude, they got the  digital landlord, they got the smiley, and we're gonna be  popping 650 Rubik's cubes into people's homes. And I'm hoping  that moms are going to trip on them. I'm hoping they're going  to end up in minivans. I'm hoping they're going to end up  at schools. And we're going to spread the gospel of rank and  rent. So just as a heads up, guys, you don't need to go spend  two grand, but get creative and think about opportunities. I got  650 little morons coming to my house. Just kidding. They're not  all morons. But a lot of these are pesky little kids. And  instead of giving them a Twix, that's going to just go go and  ruin their teeth, we're giving them a Rubik's cube, which is  going to get their minds sharp. And it's going to get the  branding floating through the southern Utah home. So anyway,  stoked about that. Unfortunately, I'm not going to  be there. So I got my son I'm hiring to pass those out. He's  going to forgive, forego the candy, make a little make a  little cheddar and hand those out since I'm in Dubai. But  guys, use opportunities that you see fit to talk about what  you're doing. Maybe it's a, you know, it's something in your  town, you can put a booth together. I see these all the  time. And I missed them. Like at my son's school, you can do  like a booth and you can give stuff away and whatever. And  they're just good opportunities",

I don't even care  like, even where Porter's at, it's a population of like 3000  people or less, there is money in that town. In fact, I have a  client from that town, Mr. Porter. So I think you know who  that is. But anyway, so guys, today, we're gonna be talking  about how to almost get to 10k. Porter, why don't you go ahead  and share the story. And we are going to just get into this. Now,  from what I understand, technically, the deals not 100%  lost Porter sitting at $9400 per month, that is a gross nut  net, just so everybody knows. But he's at $9400 per month,  he's touched, he's almost touched the outer the outer rim  of the 10,000 multiple times, and he keeps falling a bit  short. So we're going to just rub it in a little bit Porter,  tell us what happened, where we're sitting, and what we can  expect from this deal. But  Okay, so I got I got one of this campaign going, it was in  fencing, because I got one in another one in fencing a little  while ago. So hold on, is this, would this be the first fencing  deal you've ever got?  No, this would be my second one.  So you have a client for fencing right now? Beautiful. Okay.  So I was like, I'm just gonna do the same thing. So I go into the  area, and the leads were not as heavily coming in as the first  one. So like, it took me a little bit to send this guy some  lead. But anyways, I called him. And it was the first guy I  called, it was, it was like, hey, someone's actually done  this with me before. And actually, it's someone in the  free group. It's fine. I like looked at his Facebook, and I  figured out who it was. But anyways, I figured out that he  had done this. But anyways,  Oh, tell me his name will kick him out right now.  Yeah. So he was, he didn't even tell me his name. But anyways, I  knew he, I knew who he was. So I started sending him like two to  three leads, whatever. And then I was like, hey, let's get on a  call. So I scheduled out for like the next day. And we get  on the call, I call him and I send him the zoom link, he  watches the screencast. I'm like, hey, get on the computer.  I'm trying to get this thing perfect as I can. Let's set up  like I'm making sure that he watches it. I watched my, my  screencast, make sure I included everything. And I sent it to him.  He watches it. And I'm like, sweet, I'm ready to go. And I'm  on my computer. I'm waiting. He called me. And he's like, Hey,  the zoom is not working. I'm like, Oh, my gosh. He's like,  yeah, I like I've been answering. And I'm like, Oh, my  gosh, like, for whatever reason, he couldn't figure out zoom. And  it was a Friday. And I was like, dude, I don't want to get this  half a call. So I just was like, well, let's just do it over the  phone. So this is where I think I messed up was I should have  waited until I got him on",

    "pageContent": "zoom. Because this is what happened is  we I did the call, I pitched him at two or 375 per month. And so  1500, which would have put you at 11,000, basically. Yeah. And  so like, it's perfect. So I pitched him at it. And he's like,  okay, that sounds good. I was like, am I supposed to be so  he's like, I think it's a master card. Like, oh, sweet. So I got  Yeah, I got him so I wrote his card number down. And then he's  like, I see the money on the car. Okay. So I'm like, okay,  whatever he's like, it's a car that I use them like, but now I  think about it's credit cards should be able to freaking charge.  Yeah, that was another car, or for he's on it. Yeah. I was like,  you're full crap anyway. But I didn't think about the, oh, I  got his number? Information? Whatever. So a day goes by, and  um, I keep texting like dude. Are you get the cars? Oh, sorry.  I haven't gotten there. And every day, it's like, why send  excuse, excuse. And then finally, it's so hard to get he won't  even answer my call. So I'm like, dude, this guy's dog. And  so I said, I was like, Hey, did you get my because I was like,  maybe I can just have him sign my agreement or my you know, my  credit card authorization so that I can just like sleep at  night, you know, knowing he signed it. So I send that over.  And he's like, you know, I haven't received it. So I sent a  screenshot of the credit card authorization at the bottom. I  said, he will be charged for 375 per month. And he reads it. And  he's like, wait, I thought it was $349 per month. And I was  like, I was like, what? So he literally he thought it was 349  per month. And so the price wasn't right. And it definitely  so he thought it was $1,500 for six months. So I'm like, dude,  what the hell do you mean? That is that is not right. So I  explained to him and he was on the fence about it. And I called  him last night, talked to him. And I was like, dude, like,  where are you at? And he wants to do it. And then at the end of  the day, he's just he's scared to make money scared to, you  know, spend the money. But anyway, I think the deal is  lost. I sent him a breakup text because I was tired of dealing  with him last night. I was like, dude, shit or get off the plot  because I wasted so much time the last couple days. So I just  didn't want to find somebody else.  It's a heartbreaker, bud. It's a heartbreaker. So all right. I'm  curious in the chat, who the heck has had something similar  to that to this happen to them? By the way, Gina Benson,  welcome to call. Good to see on I saw a few more people popping  in. Who has had something similar to this happened to  them in the in their entire career? Maybe they've only been  in the game a little bit and have had to happen. I've had  this happen, by the way, but this is far from uncommon. And  we're going to talk about this today. And yeah, that deal is  toast, but you go",

And you just chalk it up to a lesson learned. You know what  I'm saying? But we are going to break this down today. But I am  curious in the chat. Has anyone had a similar experience? You  thought you had it? Oh, here we go. Get comments. I didn't even  see. Aaron Vogler says yes, yes, yes. With a triple quadruple  pack. Yes, he has. We got Jared Ochs has had a similar thing  happen twice in the last two weeks. Damn. But Porter, for  real, send me that guy's name. Kick him out of the group, block  him. And I'm going to see if I can get his account completely  span, removed from Facebook. Just kidding. Brandon Shulman.  Absolutely. Okay, so guys, this is a common thing. Porter, you  know, since you're my brother, I'm not gonna say you shouldn't  feel bad because you should, bro. You could have had the  frickin deal, dude. You know, but what it is. So let me start  off by saying this. This happens in any kind of sale  possible. The first time this ever happened to me, I'm not  going to go on story time forever. But you do need to  understand the very first time this ever happened to me in my  entire life. I was in Kearney, Nebraska. Yes, just like you say  Kearney is like when there's the fair, but it's spelled K E A R  N E Y could be an interesting city. Go check it out. It's  it might fit the the pop the the search volume on some of the  niches. Anyway, I mean, Kearney, Nebraska spring break 2013.  Instead of being in Miami trick and chasing women and doing all  that, I had a baby back home wife back home, and I was  knocking doors in the cold. So try that went on for size, but  I'm out in Kearney, Nebraska. And it's a Saturday, and I'm  trying to do my best. I'm trying to make money. It's I'm  frickin drove all the way there. And I, you know, I had a bunch  of deals teed up from Friday to Saturday, come back, come back,  come back, I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm too  young, too stupid to understand that people are full of crap and  they're liars, even though they're humans and they're  adult. So I'm waking up Saturday morning, stoked,  excited, listening to music, thinking I'm gonna have three  deals in the bag by lunch, and I'm going to sail into the  sunset on my way back home. And within about an hour, I realized  I'm gonna have to put on my frickin big boy panties and go  get a deal because all of those deals fell through. First one,  note on the door. Second one, no answer. Third one, don't know  where they're at. All the lights are closed, blinds are closed,  kids peeking through the frickin blinds like don't answer the  door. All of them done. So I'm knocking. I'm scrapping. And  guys, in my mind, I was like, if I have to drive, I don't even  know, it's like 12 hours from Kearney, Nebraska to St. George,  Utah, correction, Cedar City, Utah at the time, I am going to",

And I had the whole  Saturday. So I'm literally scrapping to the point where at  lunch, I told them not even to pick me up. I'm like, I have to  get a deal. So my manager came, he brought me like a Gatorade and  like a disgusting protein bar that I didn't eat. And I sat in  the car for five minutes and went knock. So I knock on the  store, guys from South Africa, I do my pitch, I get in the house,  I do the walkthrough. But I started skipping a few steps.  Like I remember, I didn't let him sit down at the table, like  all these little things kind of like Porter's talking about  where, you know, he didn't do the zoom call. Have I closed  deals before not been on a zoom call? Yes. Does it increase my  chances? Yes. But I kind of got a little bit lazy, because I  was so like, I was like Porter, like I had gotten deals almost  every day that week. And I was just so not desperate, but I was  so anxious to get a deal on Saturday, just like Porter so  anxious to finally cross that 10k mark. It's almost like you  have like this bad juju over your head. And I didn't I just  skipped a few steps and I didn't even let him sit down and I was  kind of rushing. Anyway, I pitched the deal. And he's super  interested in the thermostats because you can control them  from the phone. This is before Nest and everything. This is  very, very like high tech to everybody. And the guy's like,  he says to me, he's like, Well, hold on, like we get done. He  says yes, he gives me his information, like the deal is  done. And I'm filling out the card, just to call in and get  this thing set up. And he says to me, he goes, Hey, real quick,  just as a just a heads up. I have, you know, three  thermostats, not two. Will this work? Okay, or he says something  like that, or I've got this other kind of a system. Will  this work? And I hesitated just a tiny bit, because I didn't  want to lie to the guy, but I never heard this question. I was  like, Yeah, it should. There should be no issues. I like,  yeah, I don't think there's any problem. I said, let me just call  my manager really quick. And I'm gonna let me just double  checks. I really didn't want to like, lie to him or whatever.  Anyway, I think I just text my manager and I was like, Hey, can  you do this? And he was also trying to get deals and he  didn't respond. And I was like, Hey, he hasn't responded. But I'm  telling you, if this doesn't work, then we can just lower  your price, whatever. But I'm 90% sure that's gonna work. Well,  90% was not good enough for him. 90% was enough for him to feel  a little bit hesitant, a little bit queasy about the deal. And  from there, I just lost him. And he's like, Well, you know, I  had this meeting, I'm going to go check the meeting out, you  get the answer, come back, meet me, and then we'll do the",

The other crappy part is I found out that yes,  indeed, that I didn't lie, it did do that thing that I that he  did do three thermostats, whatever. And the lesson that I  learned, and it sucked, because I actually left the house, you  know, went and tried to get another deal. And I came back  thinking, Oh, thank goodness, this guy's gonna be home, and  I'm gonna be able to get this deal. And I got back and met  him there telling me, you know what, I thought about it more.  And this isn't something that I need right now, blah, blah,  blah, blah, blah. So basically, the same exact story that you  have, but in alarms, and I've had this happen so many times  to me, we're doing rank and rent that I'm sick and tired of  even thinking about it. So this is something that happens. But  yeah, let's let's break this thing down, guys. Where do you  guys think Porter went wrong? Porter, where do you think you  went wrong? You think you went wrong, not getting on the zoom?  Or where do you think that we lost this deal? Because I'm  telling you right now, I don't think the guy was confused about  375 per week. I think that was just an excuse. I think he  definitely knew what it was. I think that he came back and that  was just him trying to save face based on what you're telling me.  But what do you think you wrote? You went wrong, bud.  I think definitely the zoom call I this is this is what pissed  me off too, though, as he closed one of the deals. So I was like,  bro, and that's why I told him, I said, did you close one of  these jobs? I sent you like, you're telling me like, I don't  see you three. So I didn't think that was a problem. I feel like  I said enough to be the sender screencast. The only thing that  I didn't do was get I get them on the zoom call. And I  obviously I didn't make sure that the deal went through on  the call. You know what I'm saying? Like, I didn't feel like  I actually like got a yes or no. And I should have just said,  hey, if it's a yes, it's either yes or no, it may be is a no.  And I shouldn't have let him freaking get off. I should have  just, you know.  So let me ask you a question. Let's dissect this a little  bit. You said in three leads over the course of how many how  many days weeks? How many leads? Yeah,  it was like one. It was like a week.  Okay, so every week three leads. Did he close? Which one of the  three leads he closed number one, two or three?  Number three, the third one,  the third one. And that's when you decided to go for that's  that's textbook. Good job, by the way, because you don't need  to send him five if he closed number three. So you did all  that correctly. You sent him the screencast did. Yeah, the only  thing guys, remember that when you lose a deal when you lose a  sale, most of the time, it's the step previous. So you think, oh,  you know, I didn't do a good job in",

    "pageContent": "the presentation. And that's  why I lost the deal. But really, it's typically something if you  lost the deal there, it's probably something in the  previous step, which is the setup. And I mean, I think  there's two things that could have happened. I think number  one is, you know, guys, I ran calls trying to close deals on  the phone for four years. I isn't it's crazy. Porter, did  you know that I didn't start doing zoom closes until 2020?  I did not. It's so hard. I was getting so frustrated.  Now there. Let me say this. I when I say I didn't I didn't  do them like consistently once in a while I would but it was a  little bit more comfortable for me because I felt a little bit  like nervous having to sit in front of a screen and talk to a  human even though it was a computer screen. So I was the  one that was opting usually for the phone call I'd get my card  is kind of like a de stress or I could talk and whatever. But  guys, I for the first first four years of my rank and rank  career, I did not use zoom. And then the only reason I started  using zoom is because it was COVID and everyone is talking  about zoom. And there was like all these memes on zoom and  people doing weird stuff during classes and calls and stuff. And  I was like, and everyone was like zoom, zoom, zoom. So I was  like, Okay, I'm gonna start using it. And then I just shot  through the roof. And I was like, I'm an idiot. Because it's  just like being in person to the point that even if I was closing  somebody in Dubai, and they want to go to dinner, I would choose  to do is I go to dinner, I choose to do to do a zoom call  to close the deal because I can show them things. People are  serious when they're at their desk at their computer. But  that's number one, guys, always, always, always, always, always  get on a zoom call. Now, I'm at the same time, because this is  an art not a science. You know, sometimes you you try so hard to  get on a zoom call that you miss the deal, you miss the energy  and whatever. And so I will say there are times when conditions  can't be perfect. But dude, I would rather even someone be on  a zoom call in a gas station parking lot on their phone,  than be on a phone call, because you ended up running a phone  call, correct? Yeah. Yeah. So that I would say that's number  one. And then the second thing, and it's something I want to  talk about really quick, too. And by the way, Brandon said,  well, let's look at our comments here. Aaron said, Yeah, hopping  on a zoom, probably would have built more trust seems like that  was the issue. I agree with you, Aaron. And that is one of the  things, I would say the hardest thing here, sending the leads  does help build trust. But when people can see you, they can see  this is a real person. And if they have my credit card,  they're actually not going to like scam me. That helps a lot. I  agree. And then Brandon says, what if you would have  compromised said, let's do it for 349 per week for a month or  two, and then it will go to 375. So Brandon, just a little  clarification. The guy's claiming that he thought it was  $349 per month, instead of per week. So it's not a discrepancy ",

    "pageContent": "of 15 or $25. It does discrepancy of 1200 $1,100 of  difference per month. So the guy's basically, in my mind,  full of crap. And saying that he thought it was something else  when I think that's bullcrap. What do you think, Porter?  No, now, after I'm done with this, everything that I'm  thinking about, I'm like, that's so dumb. Like, I showed you the  screencast, like everything that I was pointing at, like, I  didn't drop the price. But during the call, I clearly said,  Hey, $1,500 per month, like, I was not hesitant about that. I'm  like, you, you're, you're, you're full of crap.  Yeah, you can't I mean, it's it did he ever sign the contract?  No. Okay. So yeah, he definitely knew. Here's the other thing  guys. And this is another really, really important thing  is I have a live Aaron, if you're still on this call, I  would love for you to pull this up. And maybe we can reference  it in the comments. But there's a live we have it's called drill  the hole. And there it is so important that you guys getting  a credit card. unbelievably important. You did a great job  because a lot of people say, Hey, call me and I'll give you  my credit card digits. And that's great. But running the  credit card is the key. Okay. And so I have this live, I don't  want to like spoil it. But basically, there was something I  used to do in door to door sales, a lot of the stuff that  I that I learned, that's like the fundamental stuff about  sales, I learned from door to door sales, but it's exactly  the same here. And what I would find guys is that when I got a  deal, I'd close somebody on getting an alarm that was going  to be in their house for the next however many years, five  year contract, I would get the credit, I'd get the credit card,  I'd get the check, I would get the contract signed everything  right, just like Porter did. But sometimes like we would always  try to schedule by the way, we would always try to schedule to  get these things scheduled right away. So if I close you today,  like right now, I would have it scheduled tonight, because I  knew that if I didn't, there was a good chance that you were  going to cancel. Okay, that's just what happened because you  start thinking about it. And it was emotional sale. Oh, man, five  50 bucks a month or whatever that's $600 a year, or more, we  could do something else that but then what I started realizing  is that if I could just get some of the equipment in the house,  even one piece of equipment and charge their card charge their  bank account for that initial deposit, even if it was $100, I  almost never lost any deals, I swear to you, and my technicians  would get really pissed off because they wanted to get to  the house, install the whole thing and not have to come back.  So I'd have to text the technicians and be like, yo, this  lady is not going to be cool with you staying in her house  till midnight. She's a single lady. And you look pretty scary  and you haven't showered in like a year. But I'm going to pay  you whatever 100 bucks or not probably 20 bucks that time  said it wasn't making 100 bucks to throw around. I'll pay you  20 bucks, come",

And just because guys, it was crazy the amount because then  guess what it was real to them. They could see it on the wall.  And most importantly, we had charged the card and the damage  was done. There was no going back even though it was possible  to get their money back. It was so much harder. So what I highly,  highly, highly, highly recommend by the way, Aaron just  referenced it, that is a phenomenal live and it is very  true. And we do this the same with anything that we sell, we  sell is get a payment, send the guy an invoice, say, Hey,  Porter, what I would have done, hey, I'm gonna send you an  invoice, you can put the money on later, but I got to get at  least like $100 down payment, non refundable. And I'm going to  send it to you real quick. And then I'll charge the rest of it,  you know, let's say in 24 hours, but I'm going to charge 100  bucks. So hang on one second. I promise you if you would have  charged even 100 bucks, there would have been an 80. I'm just  throwing numbers out here. But maybe, you know, 80% chance he  would not have went sideways on you.  No, it pisses me off so bad because I was like this thoughts  and you said yes.  Yeah, and that's the frustrating part. And I you know,  Francesca's lost deals like this, Kyle's lost deals like  this, I've lost deals like this. And I'm hoping that people on  this call are not going to lose deals like this guys, if you get  the deal, make sure you frickin run the deal on the call. Okay,  and good. Look, I understand the situations people are lying.  We've had the craziest stuff happen. We've had people giving  the credit card, and they're reading all the digits and they  get to the last four and they cut the zoom and they pretend  that their phone died and you never hear from them again.  We had a guy just barely this is so amazing. We had a guy in  the last couple weeks, about a month ago, get done, we figure  it out, put a deal together. He's pumped. This guy has been  hitting me up for years about doing this. And anyway, long  story short, he gets the credit card information to us. And he  tells Kyle, he's like, Yeah, I'm sorry, he doesn't give the  credit card information. He's a yes, he's I'm good. He's a  whatever. And then you know what he says? He says, I lost my  wallet. Let me I'm gonna have to find it. And then I'll let you  know. It's like, bro, no one lost their wallet. And I don't  know about you. But I have like 15 cards saved on my computer.  And I know my card. And I've got a picture of my card, and all  this different stuff. And dude, Kyle, Kyle, Kyle took the bait,  dude. Kyle took the bait called me got the deal. We got the  deal. Didn't run the deal. I was like, yeah, things done, dude.  Guess what, dude still hasn't done it.  In two weeks.  Oh, it's been like a month. And then we finally got a text back.  We started giving him a hard time. We're like, Hey, bro, are",

We're giving him a hard time. And that  was like, finally, like, oh, sorry, been busy. We had a baby  and I can't make any decisions to after the baby. And it's  like, bro, you already said yes, you said you lost your wallet.  So point is, guys, I don't care if these by the way, Richard  Marches, welcome to the call, my friend, it doesn't matter how  old people are doesn't matter if they're men, women, doctors,  lawyers, frickin, whatever people are full of schnazzle.  And they will lie straight through their teeth while  looking you in the eyes and eating frickin, whatever. That's  just how people are. Do not leave the call. First of all,  always get on a zoom call every single time. Let's talk about  that really good Porter. I couldn't get on the zoom call you  said because he had an Android. Is that a thing? Because he  should know.  I think I was that was complete bull crap. I think he didn't want  to get on the zoom call because he was he was out on a job. I  told him I said, Hey, I need a computer. That was his first  thing I told him I said be on a computer. He was that was this  one thing. And then zoom I called him I was like, we're like,  are you home? He's like, no, I'm out on a job. I'm like, okay,  well, that sucks. Like, so now he's in his truck. And then the  zoom call, which I think you can join zoom, just join in your  browser. So I'm like, I don't think he just wanted to get on  zoom. He was just making that excuse.  100%. So here's the thing, guys, is if I'm doing a call, and I've  tried to get this deal, and the guy closed a job, and I'm like,  hey, look, this guy's hot, let me get on it, whatever. And I, I  could see and I could I could justify like, all right, you  know, perfect scenario, he's at a computer, and he's on zoom. I  could justify though, getting on a zoom on your phone on the job  site, I'd say, hey, can you go in your truck? Let's talk like  that's still not ideal. But it's it's it works. And I've closed  deals like that. But I would rather wait, I would I would  literally tell the guy maybe on the spot, something like, hey, I  you know, no disrespect here. I've sent you three leads, you  already made money. You said you'd be on a zoom call, I need  you to be on a zoom so I can show this to you. Can I like, if  it's not that I need you to be by computer in the next couple  hours, I probably would never get on a call call on without  being in zoom, unless maybe I had tried two, three times. And  I was like, at this point, I'm just losing that momentum, that  steam that energy that whatever, that's when I might justify  that. But I would say it's, it's, you could justify getting  on a zoom on the phone, but definitely make sure you get on  a zoom, even if it's a gas station parking lot on a on a  job site zoom",

Like if, you  know, people, it's, again, when we go back to door to door  sales, guys, there's these little things that the more of  it's, it's like the training, right? Sales is like baking a  cake, we have the perfect recipe, we're telling you exactly  when to put in the flour, when to bake, when to, you know, stir  the eggs, when to add this, how much butter, what brand of  butter, whatever. And, you know, you guys can, you know,  you have to do it perfectly. And you might still have a cake  that's that works, right? But the less of the of the  recommendations, the more you deviate from the exact recipe,  the more variables there are, and the more chance you have of  losing the deal of the cake coming out tasting like garbage,  right? So you do what you can, you know, once in a while, you're  like, all right, ideally, you're supposed to use this kind of  butter. But today, we only have this kind of butter. It's not  perfect. But you know what, we need the cake because it's  somebody's birthday, I'm going to slam it in. That's a good  that's something that you could look past. Something like not  getting on a zoom call. That's like, you know, using baking  powder instead of flour. Like that's tough, right? And yes,  maybe once in a while, you're going to squeak out a deal. But  I'm telling you guys right now, we're gonna we're talking about  this, because it's just for everybody to not lose this, make  sure you guys get on a zoom call every single freaking time,  even if it's in a gas station parking lot, even if it's on a  job site, and just tell the business owner, especially  Porter, you had enough leverage because he you'd you'd send him  three leads and he closed one you had made him money without  anything in return. So I think it would have been completely  fine for you to say like, look, dude, you told me to be on a  call. I need you to like get to a truck and get on a zoom you  sir, you have to push a link. I've done this 100 times. I don't  care if you have an iPad, you just push the link and it's  gonna put you on pretty simple. My grandpa does. Yeah, you can  joke about it. But get on a zoom. Yeah. Okay, so it's okay,  bro. Um, nothing like losing nothing like losing a $18,000 a  year, but could have been pretty nice to when you think about  it like that. It makes you sick, right? Yeah. Dude, I I've been  to the very, very end of deals and been like, I literally did  all this work. It's been it's been weeks of work. And I just  lost at the very end because I was lazy or because I said this  or because I did that. And it's frustrating. Okay. So Trevor  time says not being able to get a zoom call from an Android is  100% BS. Yes, that is absolutely true. Because guys, all you have  to do is click on it. Yes, we know that I enjoy is our  inferior. Just kidding to you Android users. To be honest, I  just think that Apple's got me by the teeth. But you can just  click on a link. And Aaron says, Yeah, someone needs to tell zoom  to get compatible with Android lol. Okay, Corey",

We have a few live calls  that I've done. These are some of the OG calls from 2020. You're  going to see that my process isn't perfect. I'm still  learning. But you definitely can see that I'm a young buck, just  trying to make a name for himself back in the the on the  interwebs. Gina Benson says, What do you think about recording  a video to send to the business owner before getting on the  zoom? Yeah, I do that. I don't know. Maybe Gina's talking  about said like having one video that you can send that could be  a good idea. That's a really good idea. And I'm guessing  part of you said in the zoom that like kind of explained what  the expectations were before, right? Yeah, screencast. Sorry.  What do you think about recording a video to send the  business owner before getting on the zoom? Yeah. So yeah, I'm not  really sure you're saying Gina, but if you're saying because  that is actually a really good idea. I like to do with lead  generation deals, I really like to have, I'll take the time to  manually create a custom video, a custom screen recording a  custom screencast for each one, because then I can say their  name again, and again, and again, I can show their website,  it's very custom, and it's 10 minutes long, five minutes long.  However, with those of you, all of you that are on this call  that joined digital landlords, we do the same thing, we have a  call that kind of sets expectations. It's funny, we do  the exact same process that we teach with you guys, when you  join this program, right, we send you a screencast, it's not  exactly customized for every single person. But that  screencast says, here's the expectations. You know, when you  get to the end, don't don't tell us you need to do this, this,  this or this, like, we are expecting you to give us a yes  or no, if it's a maybe it's a no. And we're going to get on and  show you this, this and this. And we're going to ask you to  make a decision, like, we do the exact same thing. So that's a  good idea. Let's see, Gina says, yeah, like custom for each  one. Yeah, that's, that's what I that's what I do. That's exactly  what I do. Aaron says, Andy, the you can't sell an Android  user truth lives on. It is a little more difficult. I sold  Android users, but I know what you're saying, bro. Okay, Aaron  says to Corey, he's gonna message a few screencasts Nick  has done for real profit. Also, Corey, if you want, like, I'm  going to check this out. Like if I, if you go to, if you just go  to the Facebook group, I'm going to see what the smart search  I'm just I have no idea how I'm even going to find it. I'm going  to go to the Facebook group, I'm going to go to the little  search bar and put live recording. Hold on. Maybe live  sales call. Okay, there's Yeah, right there. Okay, that's let's  see. Hold on. There we go. I got one right there. Oh, that's a  discovery call. Just",

But if you don't want to wait for anyone,  look, there's another one right there. Borhan, one of our  students actually posted his deal. There's a bunch of them  just type in smart searches, live recording, live call. I'm  going to I bet you type if you type in live close, like this  live close Nick would inside of the group search bar. There we  go. Boom, found one right there. There's a there's a deal that I  lost right there on December 7 2022. If you want to see that  one, there is let's see, I bet I can find another one quickly.  Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold tight. See if I can find  another one. There's a picture of Kanye in a boat. You guys  know what I'm saying? That's great. Let's see. Oh, right  there. There's another one. Yeah, anyway, that's just another  idea, guys. Video two of to build your list. Just go do a  couple smart searches. But Aaron, yeah, that would be cool  if you could if you could help him out as well just to kind of  speed things up. Okay. I'm just gonna see if there's one more.  Dude, I by the way, guys, for those of you that have been in  this group. Oh, here we go. I'm gonna here's a $1,200 a month  flat fee close. Corey, I'm gonna tag you in this one right now  just to save Aaron some time. But just guys. Yeah, that's one  thing to know in this group. That's the beautiful thing about  Facebook groups, even though I freaking hate Facebook sometimes  is if you just go in and search for certain things like Oh, what  would Nick probably have done live clothes live this just  type in Nick would and whatever you can find a lot of material  this group is almost three years old and it's chock full of  material. Okay. So anyway, just tagged you, bro.  Your clothes on the guy in St. George the excavation guy right  before my first deal. I watched that the night before just to  get a good feel.  Oh, yeah, dude, it's it you know what I used to do every single  day before I hit the doors. I would listen I there was the  guys the top guys making the most amount of money. They had  their pitches recorded and they were put in like our company  training. And I promise you, I would listen like a 20 minute  video. I would listen to Oz making my omelet. I would listen  to it as I get in the shower. I listen to every freaking day. And  you know, it was amazing. I would get on the doors, I would  get at a closing table, somebody would say something and I would  just say this one liner. And it was like exactly like, you know,  this there's this guy named Jordan Williams, it was like one  of the OGs and he had like 400 accounts made how many $100,000  as like a college kid selling selling alarm systems. And I  would say the exact same lines the exact same ways that he  would. And it was like, okay, I'm like programming my  subconscious. So guys, I'm not saying I'm the only person knows  how to close deals. But I scaled quickly we went we were closing  every freaking deal we were on fire. And if you guys want to go  to my 2020 calls, we have probably four",

I  know it's maybe you don't want to maybe you can get on the  treadmill, whatever and just you're going to start hearing and  saying things that I say how I explain the monopoly thing how  I explain this how I explain that the confidence that I have  when I go for the close and help Corey, Corey Gilbert knows  exactly who Jordan Williams is. That's hilarious. Because he  also did door to door. Okay, let's see. Shane Coogan can also  have the screencast. Yes. So they're not screencast. These  are actually recordings. Corey, since you're on this call, so I  just tagged you if you could hook Shane up real quick and tag  Shane on that video as well. That might push it to the top.  But guys, these are these are not record. These are just  recordings. They're not screencasts of me doing live  closes. Okay. Gina says you're gonna check it out. Oh, there we  go. Aaron just barely had went ahead and posted for us. So  guys, in the next 12 minutes, let's let's see what what  questions you guys have. What? This could be about sales, this  could be about losing deals, closing deals, get a 10k. Any  question you have drop in the chat and that what I'm going to  ask you Porter is what have you learned on this journey of  scrapping your way to $10,000 because it has been a scrap  Porter, he went he got to do I think you got to like 85 one  time. Yeah. And then you got busy with farming, which is  natural, you dump some of your business owners weren't super  solid, you lost a couple deals. There was that like you almost  touched it then I think you're at nine and then you dropped and  then you you like turn it back on you're at 9400 and you almost  just had 10,000 you're gonna get 10,000 obviously but like  now you're like give us what have you learned just trying to  hit that 10,000 it's almost like you got this like dark cloud of  doom hanging over your head you're like oh my gosh, I'm not  sure if I can hit it you obviously can but it's sometimes  it's like when you want something so bad. It's like so  hard to hit but yeah, tell us about that.  I honestly even with the last couple deals that I've gotten I  tried to have a different mindset of getting these deals  like instead of like like that 10k is such a big number which I  know I mean it's a lot of money but like in the grand scheme of  things it's not but like to me I've always made it this huge  deal and I feel like it's like psyching me out a little bit you  know I'm saying like I'm this close but then like I make the  zoom call too much pressure like I'm forcing it too much and  like the last couple deals I was like hey if I get to 10k and  because the goal was hey I want to get to 10k and it wasn't even  to get to 10k before I was on farming but like it kind of  worked out that way because I was landing a couple deals and  then I was like dude I gotta hit this like I want to hit it this  month like I was setting goals and we were like trying to get  these things happening and I think I had sales breath I really  do think at the end of the day I should have just been like",

    "pageContent": " Can you go over why not PPL one more time in the fight?  Yeah, okay, so Josh, he's asking,  how do you get rid of the PPL objective?  So what I do during the screencast  and also during the close is I say,  all right, so as far as the deal goes,  we don't do commission, just so you know,  the reason why is there's literally  no skin in the game for you.  It doesn't work out.  Nope, like you're not gonna have any incentive  to follow up with leads.  I don't wanna track it.  You don't wanna track it.  It's a waste of time.  I don't do that, okay?  And I'll say, and I always say that,  say what we used to do when we first started  is we watched Home Advisor and we thought,  now maybe we'll try the paper lead model.  And we did it because we thought it would be really easy  to sign business owners up  because they only pay for what they get.  But what happens, and this happens every single time,  Mr. Business Owner, and without fail, okay?  And this is why we do not do this anymore.  We haven't done it for years is there is a threshold.  So let's say that I'm sending you 10 leads  at a hundred bucks a piece just for easy math, okay?  And by the way, when you say that example,  use a high number so that they're already like condition  that it's high.  So let's say that I'm sending you 20 leads  at a hundred bucks a piece.  You're cool paying me two grand, okay?  Two grand within your budget, 2000, 2000, 2000.  But what happens when, Mr. Business Owner,  all of a sudden I go from 20 leads to 50?  You know what's gonna happen?  I'll tell you what's gonna happen.  You're gonna start complaining about leads  because you don't have the manpower to run 50 leads, okay?  So now you're gonna start not wanting  to go to certain zip codes.  You're not gonna wanna take certain jobs.  You're gonna wanna hire and raise your minimum price.  And all of a sudden, I'm not gonna make any more money  and you're gonna be complaining about it.  And we're gonna literally have this back  and forth every single month.  And you're gonna take out your red pencil  and I'm gonna take out mine.  It's a absolute headache.  So we do not do that anymore, period.  What we found is a lot better is we just do a flat rate.  And what happens is every single month,  it's the exact same.  We usually charge per week, by the way.  In December, this is a great place to introduce this,  by the way, in December, just so you know,  it is gonna be a little bit slower because it's December.  But the cool part is, is in the spring and the summer  and the fall, when it's higher than normal,  you don't get a knock on your door like,  hey, let's raise the price.  So that's why we do the flat fee.  So let me show you how we came up with your flat fee,  Mr. Business Hunter.  Here's what I call the lead value calculator.  Whatiseleadworth.com.  There you go, Mr. Josh Savage.  Boom.",

    "pageContent": " Sam says, could you do automated check-ins?  Absolutely.  Absolutely could do automated check-ins.  I do think the phone call goes a long way,  like just checking in with them.  I think if you want to do an automated check-in,  maybe like half the time, and maybe half the time  you do a call, maybe you have it set up.  The second and the fourth week, it's an email.  And it's like, hey, whatever, whatever.  The second week is this email, it's already scripted out.  This one's this email, and maybe every month it changes.  Totally.  I think the other two weeks though, you need to call them.  I think at least specifically for this first  three to six month contract, you need to call them  and you need to let them know that you care,  that you're paying attention, that you're focused on them.  Now, after that first contract's done  and you've signed the new one, that's when you can go,  okay, what parts of this can we automate?  That's where they're so much easier to work with.  Like, dude, the only time I even talk to my clients,  let me give you an example, my artificial grass client,  I've had him since 2021, okay, like the first of 2021.  So I guess we're coming up on two years.  I don't talk to this guy, like we just keep doing business.  Now, I talked to him today.  Well, he didn't answer.  I called him today, but it wasn't to talk about business,  it was because I needed a quote on a townhome  that I just bought.  And I had his little patch of grass and it looks like shit.  I'm like, hey, let me get my guy to give me a quote.  So they just become so much easier.  Once you gain that trust, Sam, or anyone else asking,  once you gain that trust during that first  three to six month period, things ease up,  but take your time, be okay doing things.  I heard this once, I loved it.  Be okay doing things that are unscalable  because sometimes the unscalable things  are the things that allow you to scale.  I know that sounds kind of weird.  Let me say that one more time.  Be okay doing the unscalable things  because sometimes those unscalable things  are the very things that allow you to scale.  What I mean by that is it's not scalable  to checking every one of your clients every Friday.  I get it, okay?  However, sometimes those things that aren't scalable,  they show the business owner, hey,  I know this isn't scalable.  He can't possibly do this to everyone.  And that's the reason why it's so effective.  So I would tell you during those first three to six months,  that first contract, be okay making a phone call.  And in the back of your mind, okay,  let's set up some automation so that once he or she  signs that second contract, boom,  it's just an automated system, okay?  Great question.",

    "pageContent": " Guys, before we go any further and before we get, you know, jump into this, get started,  I want to explain to you and stress the importance of the fact that the money is actually made  in picking the city and the niche combination.  And I really, really mean that it's super, super important.  And so I'm going to use an example from physical real estate.  The reason I like to use examples from physical real estate is because we are doing the exact  same thing, but doing it digitally or doing it online.  We want to become digital landlords.  So there's a saying in physical real estate, and they always say this, okay, and by they  I'm talking about the books, the experts, the gurus, the investors, and they always  say the money is made in the buy, not in the sell, okay?  What does that mean?  It means that if you're going to go purchase a, let's call it a duplex or a single family  home for $200,000, okay?  If you go and you buy a property, a duplex, let's say, that's worth $200,000, but you  purchase it for $160,000, you immediately are going to win.  Even if you turn around and you sell it for market value or below market value, you're  going to win because you immediately got $40,000 of equity, right?  You bought it for $160,000, it's worth $200,000.  You're going to win no matter what, and likewise, with digital real estate, if you pick the  right city and the right niche combination, you are almost guaranteed success, okay?  So there's a couple of reasons why this is super, super, super important.  All right, reason number one, by choosing the right city and the right niche, you are  going to be able to avoid very competitive, heavy SEO.  Nothing gets more tiring, nothing burns you out quicker, nothing is more frustrating than  just chugging along and doing backlinks and content and this and that and the rest.  It's very, very frustrating, and especially when you know you could put the same amount  of time into another niche and city combination and yield much higher results.  You could get ranked much quicker.  Number two is by not having to do heavy SEO, it's going to allow you to rank your site  quicker, and the quicker you can rank your website, the less money you're going to have  to spend on ads, the less money you're going to have to spend on ads, the more money you're  going to put in your pocket, and I think, at least me, the reason I'm here is I'm trying  to make money.  All right, number three is by picking the right city and niche combination, you are  going to be able to find areas where your cost per click on Google Ads, and we're going  to get into this, don't stress it, don't freak out if you don't know what that means, and  that's called CPC, but this is very, very simple stuff.  I'm not going to go into it right this moment, but you're going to be able to find cities  and niches where the cost per click is very inexpensive, and what that means is if it's  inexpensive for you, it's going to allow you to get more leads, in theory, for less money  out of your pocket, which means the business owner is going to get more leads by you spending  less money, which means they're going to be happier, and you're going to be able to retain  them longer.  So a huge benefit of picking the right city and the right niche combination is you're  going to be able to find",

    "pageContent": "those combos where you're going to find inexpensive ads, and  that is going to make all the difference in the world.  Trust me, and I have done this correctly, and I've done this incorrectly, and when you  do this correctly, it is night and day difference, okay?  Lastly, by doing this correctly, and it kind of goes back to what I said in the beginning,  doing this correctly almost guarantees your success.  If you can pick a city and you can pick a niche where there's low competition, there's  good search volume, meaning people are looking for that service, there's low cost per click,  means inexpensive advertising, and there's people that are willing to pay for your advertising,  say willing to pay for your leads, let me say it that way, you are almost guaranteed success.  Now, obviously, you have to put in the work because I can't do it for you, but these are  going to eliminate all the pitfalls that most people run into, okay?  And I will tell you this, I have done this incorrectly, and when I first got into rank  and rent, I took a couple of programs, and these programs, they told me how to pick my  city and niche, and maybe at the time that was more up to date, maybe I didn't listen  100% correctly, but I do a pretty good job of doing that, of actually paying attention  and doing stuff exactly, and I did it the way they taught, and I'll tell you that about  four weeks ago from the time of recording right this moment, I went through and audited  all my sites, and I went and I got rid of 125, 125, 125 of my websites that I built years  and years and years ago, that it's going to take me months, if not years, of just solid,  heavy SEO to even consider getting ranked. On top of that, my advertising is going to  be expensive, and for me, it just wasn't worth the squeeze, okay? So, from somebody who's  made the mistakes, do not make the same mistake, do not make the same mistake, take your time,  I don't care if you need to look at 100 city and niche combinations to pick one, I do not  care, it is worth your time, because if you can pick these winners, if you can pick these,  what I call layups, it's going to make everything easier, okay? And I'm going to show you an  example of a project I did, this has been a couple of years ago, and this thing has made me  an incredible amount of money, I put very little work into it, and it continues to produce over  and over and over. Okay, so guys, the project that I did, it was in a city called Bentonville,  Arkansas, and this is a city where it's the headquarters of Walmart, but what's interesting  is this only has a population of 52,000, and we're going to get into the population metrics  and all that kind of stuff and why it doesn't really matter, but it doesn't have a ton of  people that actually live there compared to other cities, right? So anyway, I just wanted  to point that out, but I went in and I built a project in a city called Bentonville for concrete,  okay? And as you can see, I am ranked number one for this term, at least, right? I'm not  probably not ranked for every term, but pretty dang close to it. I'm ranked number one here,  I'm also the number one in the maps, and you can see there's so few competition in this,  there's so few competitors, sorry, that I'm the only one ranking, okay? And so this",

Quit pigeonholing yourself or painting yourself in a corner.  Do you know what I do?

It might be a couple of days.  I just want to send you a couple of good ones.  That sound fair?  Cool.  Then guess what?  In their heads, they're expecting it potentially  to take a couple of weeks.

Now I'm asking Jeff,  what would be your recommendations there?  Right. Yeah. I think your first one about if you have a BO,  just let them know and talk to them. That's the best thing. I've gone over this.  I believe it was in the, the last live that I did,  where you can start manipulating some of the keyword themes,  because some of them are going to be more expensive than others. And so some,  you know, the keyword themes are all really broad matched.  And so what you may find, if you go back through your,  your research and your due diligence, you might find certain,  like a volume of keywords with a lower CPC versus a higher  volume with the highest CPC.  And you can start manipulating and maybe removing a keyword theme or two and  hitting refresh and see if that gets your budget lower so that you can still  kind of get some leads coming in while you're trying to get someone on the hook  and someone or why you're, you know,  why you're trying to get that business owner on a hook and land a deal.  So that's definitely a way you can try to stay in a market,  but just remember like up here, like this is now not a thousand dollar a month  deal.  This might be a $2,000 a month deal because I want to turn the ads back on for  the bigger CPC, but that's definitely a technique.  Several of you that I've helped out in the last couple of weeks, that's,  that's been, that's been very helpful.  And you've been able to keep getting ads and you've been able to stay, you know,  18 to 23, $24 a day in a market that if you were going for the main  keyword, you're looking at like almost $40 a day.  So that that's how I would get around it. It's a little,  I know it's confusing to say here, but the last live that I did,  where we recorded it, I demonstrated how to do that.",

I want to tell you about the pullback because this is going to be an opportunity where you're  probably first going to need to use this.

I'm going to tell you how to properly use it and I'm going to tell you how often you  should use it so you don't overuse it, okay, and if you actually can overuse it.  So first of all, the pullback, what the pullback is, is it's you basically making a statement  that lets them know, hey, it puts them in their place.  It checks them and lets them know, hey, you need this more than I need this, okay?  That's the pullback.  Pulling away.

You need to be in control of the deal and so the pullback is something that you can  use any time, there's a couple different places that you can use this but I will say  this, couple rules of thumb with the pullback.  First of all, you could use this as many times as you need and you're not going to ruin the  deal.  You are not going to ruin the deal.  As long as you're talking to the right people and you're not being salesy and you're doing  the stuff right and you're giving leads in advance, you will not lose a deal by doing  too many pullbacks.  I promise you.  That's the cool part.  You don't have to worry about overusing the pullback, okay?  Here's a couple places I like to use it.  This is a really good point I like to use it at because sometimes, and I've seen this  and you guys have probably seen this in the group, is you get through, you do your pitch  and the business owner, they're all yeses, baby.  Yeah, sounds good.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay, cool.  Sounds good.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's all yes.  No questions.  No objections.  No nothing.  You're like, dude, this is a golden ticket.  This guy is sold.  That's what you're thinking in your head.  Let me tell you what.  Truth is, this guy or this lady is too scared to tell you no and so it's coming out as yeah,  yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Really?  They couldn't be further from a yeah.  So if you start getting the yes guy, the yes lady, I want you to use a pullback.  Something like this, okay?  You get to the end and everything's a yes.  Hey, I'm gonna send you a couple free leads.  We're gonna talk in a couple days.  How's that sound?  Cool.  Sounds good.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.",

You're gonna stop them and say, hey, look, that sounds good.  I just want to double check.  First of all, don't take this wrong, but Jack, shoot me straight here, man.  I'm a grown ass man.  Are you interested in growing your business or are you just too scared to tell me no?  And I know, guys, I know that sounds bold, but I don't got time to waste these people,  okay?  So I'm literally gonna say, hey, Jack, real quick, before I hang up, I just don't want  to waste your time.  I don't want to waste my time.  I'm a grown ass man here, so shoot me straight.  Are you interested in growing your company or you just don't want to tell me no?  Because these are jobs that are coming in.  I only work with one company per area.  So if this isn't something like you don't want to grow and whatever, that's cool.  Just let me know now.  But just don't waste my time, okay?  And I know you're like, oh my gosh, you're gonna ruin the deal.  Nope.  Just the opposite, okay?  Just the opposite.  What you're gonna do is you're gonna wake their ass up.  And if they've been sitting there sleeping going, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, if they actually  are interested, you know what they're gonna do?  They're gonna all of a sudden come after you.  They're gonna go, oh, no, no, no, no, man, listen.  It's funny.  He's like, sorry, I'm driving.  And I kind of sound distracted, but I'm really interested.  Me and my partner or I was actually just talking to my wife or I was just talking to my husband  and I was just saying how much I'm tired, sick and tired of home.  They will start to sell you.  And the other cool part is if they're not following you and they really are the yes,  yes, yes, yes, yes, but they just don't want to tell you no, you know what they're gonna  say?  They're gonna say, yeah, man, like I don't want to, like I really don't want to waste  your time.  And if you have somebody else, like we're good.  We're good.  Okay.  And you're just gonna give them an opportunity to just walk away and you're gonna give them  an out.  Because what happens a lot of time with these yes, yes, yes, is you hang up the phone.  You're jacked.  You post to the group.  I just got somebody hooked, baby.  Let's go.  Okay.  Guess what happens?  You get the lead.  Get them on the phone.  You get Janet on the phone.  You go to call Jack back.  Jack doesn't answer.  Oh, Jack's on a job.  Hey, Janet.  Jack's gonna be calling you.  No problem.  24 hours later.  Jack's gone.  Jack's ghost mode, baby.  Jack is off.  Jack's phone number's changed.  Like guys, that guy's ghosting you.  You will never hear from them again.  And the problem is they were never following you in the first place.  They were too scared to tell you",

    "pageContent": "no.  And yes, I know that sounds funny because we're talking about grown ass men and women  lying to your face.  It happens every single day.  So I love using the pullback at the end of step four, the transition, to just make sure  they are following me.  That's if I, you know, if it sounds too good to be true, use the pullback, okay?  The other end of that is if someone is kind of being short with you, they're kind of acting  too busy.  They're acting like they're doing you a favor, like, yeah, I mean, I'm busy, but like I can  take some jobs if you want to send them to me.  In my head, I'm like, look, bro, you don't understand.  I'm not like, I got too much going on to be doing favors, right?  Like I'm happy to send you some to earn your business, to gain your trust, but I'm not  just like, you don't need to do me a favor, okay?  And I'll use a pullback then and I'll go, hey, just real quick, like, just, I want you  to know I only work with one company.  So if this is going to be a burden for you to take on more work, by like, make no mistake,  I don't need you to take on this work.  I'm asking you if you're hungry to go, are you hungry to go?  And I know that's a little aggressive and do I say it that bold every time?  No, sometimes do I?  Yes, because I'm just feeling it and I'm just not in the mood.  You guys can say this in your own way.  You don't need to be that bold, but you need to convey the fact that, hey, you need to  let them know that they need you more than you need them.  And I need you guys to mentally realize you don't need them.  There are 20, there are at least five to 20 to 50 different options in each city, in each  service that you can work with.  Guess what?  There's only one of you.  And we forget this.  We think that all of a sudden we got one option, we got one option that's the person and if  they don't do it, we're screwed.  No, that's not the truth.  The truth is you're the only person and you're the one that has what they need and you know  that because they're already paying for ads.  So get that in your damn mind and start using pullbacks and be bold.  And I do want to mention this and I'll talk about this, I'll talk about pullbacks later  in future videos.  You're also going to be able to use a pullback anytime during the process where the deal  sounds shaky, where the customer's not answering the phone, where the customer is just wasting  your time or you feel like they're wasting your time, use the pullback.  It is literally the secret weapon and I know it's very, very scary, especially the first  time you're like, oh my gosh, I just got through this really scary pitch and they said yes  and now I'm going to be that bold to just throw it all away.  Nope, you're not throwing it away.  You are just sifting out the crappy from the people that are actually serious, you're sifting  out the people who are not serious from the ones that are ready to rock and roll.  The pullback is a freaking secret weapon, master it, get used to it, I'll try and drop  some swipes but really the principle is you just",

The first thing I want to mention is this, if you are somebody that  has a job, if you are somebody that doesn't have the ability or doesn't want to have to  be glued to their phone all day every day, welcome to the club. I'm somebody where if  I get a call in the middle of the day and I picked up every single call, I would never  get anything done. My mind would be here and it would be here and it would be here. I have  to put my phone on silent. For some of you guys that are trying to get a hold of me sometimes,  that's why. I have to put my phone on silent for this to work, for me to be able to do anything,  to be productive at all. I totally understand that and I don't want you guys to worry.  If you are somebody that can't answer in the day because of a job or anything else,  it's okay. Here's what I do is I wait, I let all my calls go to voicemail or missed call or whatever  and then I put a slot of time in my calendar every day and I on my time go and look at my missed  calls and I call them back. These are the leads. I call them back and do the live transfers on my  time. If you're somebody that's like, oh, this isn't going to work for me because I have a job,  it's fine. You can do it after work. You can do it on your lunch break. You can do it on  Saturdays and if you're like, oh my gosh, I don't get off work until five, doesn't matter.  People actually answer the phone more after work. Don't stress it. It's not the end of the world.  I'm just going to teach you guys really quick the best way to do the live transfer.  First thing I want to mention is a lot of people get confused with this. They're like, well,  do you call the lead and then you hook the business owner with the lead live? Here's the  process that I do. Just a quick overview. If I haven't hooked a business owner, let's say I'm  in my first pre-sale, my first campaign, my first deal or a deal. I haven't hooked a business owner.  I've set up the campaign. I've done my niche research. I'm good to go. I've done my city  research. I'm good to go. I've built my list. I've set up my ad and a lead comes in. What I  will typically do is I will get ahold of the lead. Let's say the lead's name is Janet. I don't know  why I really like using the name Janet for this example, but I'm going to use Janet. Janet calls.  I call her back. By the way, if you do call back, I want you to say the following. Hey, Janet,  this is Nick with St. George Tree Service. You might not know it's Janet. The only reason you  would know it was Janet is if she filled out a form. Let's just say, hey, this is Nick with  St. George Tree Service. By the way, I'm actually calling you from my cell phone. It's been a crazy  day, so I apologize for the weird area code. I'm guessing you need an estimate. If you notice how  I did that, I brought up the objection first because I know she's already thinking, what the  heck is your weird area code? I have the weirdest area code ever. I bring that up first and I assume  I'm like,",

Hey,  I'm guessing you need an estimate. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I do. If you do call back, I want you to  say something to that extent of, hey, this is Nick with such and such company. You're going to act,  by the way, as the operator and you're going to let them know you're calling from your cell phone  because it's been a crazy day or you're on the road or you're out and about or whatever, or that's  just the number you grew up with because you want them to know that we are local. We want them to  know that the website is local. The first step is you're going to call the lead or answer the lead  and you are going to act as the operator, meaning you're going to act like you're just sitting there  answering the phone for the company. You work for the business owner or whatever. I typically,  if I'm answering it live, I'll say the same thing. Hey, this is Nick with St. George Tree Service.  I'm guessing you need an estimate. Okay, cool. Let me grab your information. Okay, cool. What's  your address? Awesome. What's the best number to reach yet? Awesome. Okay, cool. Zip code.  I'll get all the information and I'll say this. All right, Janet. What I'm going to do is the  business owner, I'm going to get a hold of him and we're going to get you scheduled. He is on  a job right now. He's typically out running about doing estimates. Let me get a hold of him and  we'll be reaching back out ASAP. If you don't hear from us for a minute, it's because he's on  a job. Like I said, and by the way, I might be calling from an 854 area code. That's just my  cell phone, so don't worry about it. That's just me. We will be in touch very shortly. Awesome,  Janet. Thank you. Now, Janet, the lead is teed up because keep in mind, I haven't called the  business owner. Now, this is going to change. Once we call the business owner, this live transfer  process becomes more simple because we can immediately just transfer it over. For this  first one, I just have Janet teed up. Okay, so Janet's teed up and now we go and hook the  business owner. Okay, so go back to the last step and you're going to hook the business owner. So,  you're going to use the script and you got Janet and that's the lead that you're going to use.  Okay, so now we got a hold of the business owner and if you remember from last module,  if you didn't watch it, go watch it. We tell the business owner, hey, save this number right here  or save XYZ number, whatever number is going to be doing the live transfer. We are going to be  calling you and there's going to be a live person on the phone that wants an estimate. Okay,  you're going to hook the business owner and then what I will do is I'll hang up with the business  owner and then I will call Janet back. Okay, so I'll call Janet. Hey, Janet, it's Nick again with  St. George Tree Service again. Sorry for the weird area code. I know, I know. Cool. Hey, I actually  have Jim. I just barely spoke with him. He is kind of out and about right",

Okay, so give me one second. Boom. I put her on  or I just wait and I push add call. Now, some of you guys are like, I'm overseas and I don't have  an iPhone or this doesn't work. There's a ton of tools. Guys, search the group, ask the questions.  There are tools. Everyone has found a workaround for this. I do know CallRel has an option where  you can get a phone number so you don't have to use your own cell phone and you can do a merge  feature. There's a lot of ways around this. Do not disrupt your hands and say, oh, it doesn't work  for me because I'm not in the U.S. and I don't have an iPhone or whatever. There is always a  solution so don't be that guy, don't be that lady. That's the first thing. Anyway, just a quick  caveat. Janet's right there and I push add call and I then push add call and I go find Jim and I  call Jim. Now, the way this works with the live transfer is she's going to be on mute and I'm  going to be speaking with Jim. Jim answers, hey Jim. I'm going to use my other hand so we know  we're talking to Jim. Hey Jim, Nick here again. Hey, I actually, like I told you, I had that lead,  that job, her name is Janet on the phone right now. So I just, to make it simple, I just told  her I work for you. I'm going to put you guys on a three-way call really quick and I'm just going  to have you schedule her. Just so you know, she has an oak tree, she needs it removed,  she's gotten a couple estimates, blah, blah, blah, and she's at 84790 just so you know. But again,  I just acted like I work for you so give me one second. Okay, cool. Okay, Jim's good. Jim's good,  Janet's good. Then I push this button that says merge. So I merge the call. Boom. Now everybody's  on the call. So what I say now is I go, hey Janet, can you hear me? Awesome. Hey Jim, can you hear me?  Cool. Hey guys, so Jim, this is Janet. She's the one I was telling you about. She needs her tree  removed. She's over at this street address. And Janet, this is Jim. He's my boss. He's the owner.  He's the one that's going to be coming and taking a look and giving you a free estimate. Anyway,  awesome guys. I'm going to take myself off the call. Appreciate it. And thanks again. Put yourself  on mute, okay? And your work is done. And now what you're going to do is you are going to listen,  okay? You're going to listen and you're going to listen to the business owner. You're going to make  sure he doesn't screw it up. You're going to listen to the business owner. Make sure he doesn't try to  undercut you. You're going to listen to the business owner. Make sure he schedules an estimate.  Make sure he does it correctly and he's not passive in all this different stuff and he's  not dropping price. This is going to give you an opportunity to see if this is a business owner you  want to work with, okay? So you're going to put yourself on mute and you're going to listen,  okay?",

    "pageContent": "You're going to listen to these calls. And I never ever jump back in on the call unless  I have to. So if the business owner, or sorry, if the customer starts going,  yeah, and maybe she thinks I'm off the call or whatever, she goes, yeah, so I thought I called  St. George Tree Service or I thought I called Southern Utah Tree Service, like, who are you?  Then I'll jump back in and go, hey, sorry, Janet, I'm still here. I just wanted to explain this.  The name of the company is Jim's Tree Service. That's just one of our websites. So just to clear  up that confusion. Anyway, go ahead, guys. I'll jump back in if necessary, but it's very, very,  very rare. It's only to save the deal if I can just see it's going sideways. Or if the business  owner starts going, yeah, this guy just called me out of nowhere, then I'll cut him off and be like,  hey, bro, I'm still on the line. I'm going to control that process, that handoff, because,  guys, this is digital gold. I'm not just going to let them screw up a lead, but I'm also not  going to jump in and be all weird. But the biggest thing is you guys want to listen to how these  business owners are handling the customer. All right, guys, the last thing that I want to mention  is what happens if you call Janet and you tell the business owner, answer your freaking phone,  save my number, blah, blah, blah. Then you call Janet, you get ahold of Janet, you go to transfer  the call and freaking business owner still doesn't answer. And it is very frustrating. I totally  understand that because now you're like, oh my gosh, Janet's going to think I look like I'm an  idiot. Here's what you're going to do. You're not going to panic. You're not going to be weird.  You're simply going to tell Janet, you're going to say, hey, Janet, he must have got tied up on  another job or on a call. So here's what we'll do. This is going to be the easiest thing just to make  sure it's okay with you. I'm going to just put you, in fact, don't ask. Don't ask. I don't know  why you even said that. Don't freaking ask if it's okay with you. Just do. Hey, Janet, here's what  we're going to do. He's on another job, whatever. I'm actually going to put you in a three-way group  text with me, you, and him. And he's going to message you and find a time to call you and get  you scheduled for an estimate. Okay? So watch for that here in just a moment and we will be out very  soon. And then what you're going to do is you're going to do the same thing. You're going to have  them both on the group text. Hey, Janet, this is Jim. Jim, this is Janet, blah, blah, blah, just like  you would on a live transfer. But what this three-way text allows you to do is it allows you to  monitor the whole situation, allows you to watch and see if the business owner even gets a hold  of the lead, if he even is taking action, if he's even incentivized to go after it. Because  sometimes you'll send these leads and you think, oh, these guys are calling these leads. They're  not. Okay? So you doing the three-way text, it lets the business owner know, hey, I'm watching  this thing and you better be texting her",

I'll just do three-way text. I promise you, look me in the freaking eyes.  I promise you doing a live transfer is far better. But the second best option, if they don't answer  because it's going to happen, okay, you're going to do the three-way text. All right, guys. So that  is it for how to actually send and actually perform the live transfers. Do it exactly as I say.  You can use the same lines that I've used. You can use the verbiage that I've used. Act as the  operator. Do it exactly as I've done. I've tried. Trust me. And for the third time, I have tried  every way under the sun. This is the most effective, quickest way to get them leads and close  the deal.",

    "pageContent": " Alright guys, let's talk about the 80-20 rule with ranking.  If any of you are familiar with the 80-20 rule, I'm gonna mess this up, but basically  20% of your actions make up 80% of your results, okay?  That's essentially what it means.  And so what I'm gonna talk about in this video is those couple of things with ranking that  make all the difference in the world, that make up 80% of your results.  Because with SEO, there's a lot of little nuts and bolts, there's a lot of little things  that you can do, there's a lot of little things that supposedly help.  But there are three, three core things that make up the majority of that ranking.  And this is coming from years and years of experience, talking to SEO experts, studying  SEO, taking countless courses.  There are three things that really, really, really matter.  I'm gonna cover them briefly in here, we're gonna go more into them in future videos,  okay?  I want to remind you, this is an art, not an exact science, okay?  So this is one of those like soft things, it's not like a hard, okay, do this and this  happens, it's, okay, we're trying to figure this out, Google's doing updates, Google's  playing this ridiculous game, but we know that there are three things that matter more  than anything.  So the three things are as follows.  Number one is the age of the website or the age of the domain.  Number two is the backlinks, I'm gonna explain it.  And number three is content.  That's it!  If you can nail those three things, you can understand those three things and you do your  homework correctly on choosing your city and niche, you will have websites where you can  do most everything else wrong and you will rank, okay?  So let's talk about each of them really quick.  Age of domain, very simple.  How old is your domain?  How old, how long has it been online?  And here's what you need to remember.  The older the domain, the better, okay?  The older the domain, the better, because Google's looking at it and in their eyes,  they think, well, if a website has been around for 30 years, pretty good chance that it's  legit because who keeps a website around 30 years, whereas me and you, we come online  yesterday or last week or last month or last year, we could be fly by the night.  So age of domain is something that you can't fake, it's something that you can't really,  well, you can't fake it.  There are some strategies to buying seasoned domains and old domains.  I don't mess with that because again, we're not talking about national rankings, we're  talking about these super competitive niches.  If we do, this is why I stressed so hard on making sure the city and the niche were on  point in the very, in part one of the training, okay?  In the very, very, very first module, that's why we talked about this and looking for layers  because if we do that correctly, then these things aren't as important.  But age of domain, just understand it's a factor and when you're doing your homework  on cities, if you are going up against a website that looks like garbage and you're like, why  are they ranking, it could be that that website's like 40 years old or 30 years old, whatever  the internet started.  And I've come across those, those are hard to beat.  We cannot fake that part, so we have to do the other two",

    "pageContent": "correctly.  We have to win at the other two, okay?  Next thing is backlinks and I'm just giving a brief overview here.  Backlinks, I'm gonna explain backlinks and first of all, if you don't know, backlinks  are when you're reading an article, right, or a blog and it's like, yeah, we talked about  this in our other post that you can see here and here is underlined, you can click on it,  it takes you to another article, that's a backlink, okay?  Within backlinks, there are two different types, there's a do follow and a no follow,  I'm gonna be covering that in a future module and lesson, but there's a no follow and a  do follow, do follow help, no follow, technically don't, but enough of that.  Backlinks are really simple, understanding backlinks goes like this.  You know back in high school or maybe you're one of the few in our program that is in high  school and shout out to you guys, but in high school, you know, who you hang out with, everyone  judges you on that, right?  And I'm gonna give you an example, if you are somebody that hangs out with the cowboys  or the cowgirls, even if you're not a cowboy, you are dubbed as a cowboy.  If your friend group is the group that goes and gets high on the weekend or whatever,  gets stoned on Wednesday night, even if you're not smoking weed, guess what?  You're one of the pot smokers or the skateboarders or the jocks, right?  Whoever you hang out with is who people think you are, even if you're not and it's the same  thing online.  Whoever you are linked to is who Google thinks you are.  So if the game is really simple, how do we link ourselves to people or not in this case  of websites of higher status than us, right?  Status status.  If we can link ourselves to, in a perfect world, if we could get a link from Forbes  and Entrepreneur and you know, the New York Times, even though we're this brand new kid  on the block, dude, Google's gonna go, that guy's with the, think about it, right?  If you had three billionaire friends and you guys were just out slumming the town, even  if you had zero dollars in your bank account, people are gonna go, dude, who's that guy?  Who's that girl?  She's in this group, she must be special.  That's how Google looks at it.  So we're gonna get into this, so don't overthink this, but backlinks are important.  They're kind of that like steroid, if you will.  So it's something that gives us that extra boost and there's strategies to getting those  backlinks.  You gotta understand that it's about getting linked to people that Google views as trustworthy  and of high status, okay?  And number three is content and that's the one that we're gonna focus the most on because  of a couple of reasons.  Number one, most business owners are not willing to write content and I'm actually talking  about the words that go on the page, okay?  Most business owners, when they think of writing content, they write a paragraph that's 25  words, maybe a little review at the bottom from one of their customers and boom, they're  done.  But guess what?  Think about it like this, Google does not have eyeballs.  Google has algorithms that crawl our websites.  They can't see what's on your website.  They can only read.  So how is Google, if you don't have anything besides 20",

    "pageContent": "or 25 words of content on your  website, how is Google going to know what your website is about?  How is Google going to know about concrete contractors or that you talk about concrete  contractors if you don't have any content talking about concrete contractors?  Or concrete companies, right?  Or the cost of concrete, or concrete St. George, Utah, or concrete near me.  Yet, these business owners don't understand this.  They don't put any content on their website because content is hard.  Content takes work.  Content takes thinking and thought and getting down and doing it and editing it and putting  it on the site.  It's hard.  So we're gonna do it.  We're gonna do it.  We're gonna master it.  We're gonna dominate it.  We are going to win, mark my words and listen to me carefully, we are going to win this  SEO game with content.  We can't do a whole lot about age.  We can't.  But we can do something about backlinks and we certainly can do something about content.  So when we get to the content module and you're like, oh my gosh, he's asking me to do so  much, you're welcome.  Because that is the very thing that's going to make the difference because no one's willing  to do it and it's very, very, very important.  Every word that we put on the page matters.  Every word matters because it's exactly what Google is going to look at.  And when I say look at, I mean analyze because they don't have eyes.  These are algorithms that crawl.  They read the text.  They don't look at the pictures.  They don't look at the website.  So content is super, super important.  So guys, I just wanted you to have a quick overview of these different pieces of SEO.  And the three things that matter again are the age of the domain, your backlinks and  your content.  Now, as we get going, we're gonna be talking about on-page SEO and off-page SEO and within  that there's multiple facets and we're gonna be talking about image optimization and all  these things.  But I want you to stay focused on age of domain, which you can't really control, but you need  to consider.  You need to be focused on backlinks and content.  If you can master content and you can get good at content and creating keyword lists  and writing content, and guys, it doesn't have to be perfect.  We're gonna get into that.  But if you can focus on those things, this is the 80-20 rule.  If you can focus and master those three things, you will rank in the majority of these cities  and niches if you have done module one, looking for layups correctly.  All right, guys, let's go build our website.",

    "pageContent": " Alright guys, I appreciate you being on, welcome to the call, we're gonna jump right back in.  I wasn't recording but now I am. Porter was just explaining about how he's trying to double  dip on one of his business owners that's already buying Concrete Leads for him, from him. This  is a really good hack for anybody that has multiple clients and the easiest place to  get new money or to get more money is to get money from your current business owner. And  I always used to hear this term about second money, third money, fourth money and I was  a little bit confused because I thought with second money, third money, fourth money you  had to go and you had to get it from, let's say you are getting lead generation money.  Second money in my mind was you go and get their SEO, that'd be second money, then you  go get their social media. But I also think second money is when you go and there's a  lot of these business owners run multiple companies, they're doing multiple services  because they have shiny object syndrome. So there's that, but more often what you'll see  is you'll find opportunities to get deals in neighboring cities. And so yesterday I  was talking to Jason, me and Jason and Porter were on Zoom and he pointed something out  that I knew, but I didn't realize exactly how, he said it really well. The thing about  the eastern United States, it seems like more in the east you find cities that aren't just  one big city and then a bunch of tiny little suburbs. You find a lot more smaller cities.  And that's what's nice about the east coast. So to give you an example, let's talk about  North Carolina. North Carolina you have Charlotte, that's a big city, but you also have just  north of it, you have Winston-Salem, you have, what else do you have, you have Greensboro  and you have Raleigh, I believe it is. And so those are three, and those aren't huge  cities, but you have opportunities and most businesses would cover all three. Probably  not Charlotte, but they might cover the other three. So that's one thing to think about  when you're starting to look at areas, guys, is looking at areas, yes, when you get your  first deal sometimes you just want to find that one that's close to home or whatever,  but if you can be strategic and find cities where there's more than one opportunity going  forward, you can, you're literally setting yourself up to get easy second, third and  fourth money. So right now it's December 10th, leads are going to be harder to come by, business  owners are going to be a little bit less motivated to work. I mean, if it's hard for us to get  out of bed, to go from the bed to put a beanie on, to come to the office, it's going to  be pretty tough for Bob to get in his truck and do some actual work. But right now is  a good time for you guys to go and get second money, third money, fourth money, et cetera.  So Porter, really good strategy, it's easy, they already trust you, they already know  you, I can't tell you, I've done this so many times, not as many times with a different  service, although I have done that, but a lot of times with the same service inside  of a different city. So how did you actually discover, by the way, that he did fencing?  Well, I remember last year, it was actually a little bit slower. It was seriously about  this time of year and he's like, and I was trying to prep him because I had lost business  owners at this point. So",

    "pageContent": "I was like, yeah, like the leads are going to be a little bit  slower in December. And he's like, yeah, he's like, we've been staying busy with, so he  kind of was like, yeah, well, we're okay. Like I expected that, like we're doing fencing,  we're doing, you know, we're still doing concrete jobs or whatever. So we kind of like mentioned  it, but I was like, huh, that's interesting. But it's always been in the back of my mind  to do it. But I was always hesitant because I was like, gosh dang, I don't want to, you  know, do all this work and not work out, you know, so I was always nervous, but I was like,  I don't know why I don't just try it. And after losing those two deals, I'm like, gosh,  the leads have been a little bit slow for the niches that I've been going after in the  area. So I'm like, let me just see if I can just get a quick, you know, quick deal. Cause  this guy's awesome. He, and he's like, yeah, just let me know how much it would cost. He's  like, I, I've been getting fencing jobs, like on his business card, he says he does fencing.  So every time he does like a concrete job or whatever, he'll give him his business card  and it says fencing. So he's got like three or four jobs already, just like doing fencing  jobs. So he's like, yeah, if you can get them to me, he says, yeah, I mean, I'll get it.  I'll get a crew together.  Well, there you go. So just like guys, go to your business owners that you, that you're  doing a great job for, and they will spend second money with you, third money, fourth  money. I don't recommend you to necessarily go and get money in different services. Although  if you do that, I wouldn't do the work yourself. Like if you have a strategic partnership set  up where you can take an SEO deal, for example, send it to somebody, they'll give you, you  know, 50% at least of the deal and you don't have to do the work. That's great. But again,  I think it's easier to get another lead gen deal. So anyway, that said, that's a really  good strategy. The other thing, guys, is just to put in a plug and to remind you guys, just  like the fact that we have rank and rent engine and we can do due diligence with rank and  rent engine, it's saving you so much freaking time. I, I just, I don't even know how many  hours I have spent in my life doing freaking due diligence and doing it by hand, doing  it on a Google sheet, whatever. And now we can literally go in. All you got to do is  you got to find the competitors really quick. Boom, you push one button and it's calculated  in two minutes. And if you guys haven't used it, Porter, you've, have you done due diligence  yet with rank and rent engine?  Yeah, it's so, I was so surprised. I was expecting to have to get out white sparks and  we can look at my, my citations.  And the beautiful part is the, the, the backlink tool is getting beefed up where you're  gonna be able to, you know, take a deeper dive into the backlinks. But guys, real quick,  if you are, I want to just share this little nugget really quick and then we're going to  get in to what",

    "pageContent": "the topic is today. But it's very, very easy. What I do is I have my keyword  list, I have rank and rent engine open. And then what I do is I just go clear a browser,  whatever, incognito mode, I have my five to seven keywords, I type them out, I add the  city at the end, boom, boom, boom, push for search on all five to seven searches. And  then I flip through really quick and I look at, you know, now I'm just taking a peek at  the organic. I don't pay as much attention to the maps, but I'm looking who's the top  organic person and do they show up on all five websites? If they do, or at least three  to five, three to five, if they do check the box, boom, I'm grabbing the domain, I'm putting  it in rank and rent engine. I'm doing this for the top three competitors. And I try to  exclude usually the big national players, the not the Zillow, the home advisor, the  Angie's List, that kind of stuff. I'm looking for the local people. And you put it in there,  the three websites, you push the one button, beep, and literally, it's calculated and it's  done. It's frickin ridiculous. So if you're sitting there and you guys are like waiting  for leads, not sure where to go, go look at the deals you already have and look how you  can turn it into two deals, three deals, four deals, those are the easiest thing to  do. Go get the second money, the third money, the fourth money. I promise you that's gonna  be a quick win. And nothing's better, guys, than when you finish the year on a strong  note because how you finish is how you're gonna remember the year. Even if you've had  a terrible year, even if you haven't hit your goals or whatever, if you go and just put  your foot on the gas for the next two weeks, I guess three weeks, you're gonna look back  on this year and remember it and go, man, that was a great year. I promise you because  I've done this with other things too, but it's how you finish is how you remember the  year or how you remember the experience. And also if you've had a phenomenal year, you  go ahead and take your foot off the gas and say, I'm gonna pack it in. That's how you're  gonna remember the year. It's gonna give you zero momentum going into the new year. And  I think it's the worst possible way to start the new year. Now, if you are somebody that's  been very intentional, you've said in your head, I'm gonna be taking off this week, these  two weeks to go and travel and I've earned it, whatever, that's completely fine. But  guys, go and get a deal. Even if you can get one more deal before the first year, two more  deals, it's the best thing you can do to jumpstart your next year. Okay? So let's go ahead, get  started real quick. And let's talk about the topic at hand. Oh, by the way, there's one  more thing I wanted to share. Hold on. I think there's a new code. If you guys, let's see.  By the way, guys, do you guys like in this, dude, look at this mad pic that we got going  on here, dude. This is like three years ago. I'm looking sweet, dude. What's pick are you  talking about? Look at look at this. The the little teaser here. Check this out. Look at  Jason Jason's all fresh",

Just kidding. Okay, so let's get let's go ahead and get into this.  We're gonna pardon Jason off of this call. I'm not sure what came up. I'm hoping he got a deal.  He's very rarely not on these calls. But we're gonna go ahead and give him a little bit of an  excuse. Hopefully pops in at the end. If he did sleep in, you know what, we're gonna give him a  little bit of a slack because he's human. Okay. All right. Here's what I want to do, guys. Oh,  what I was gonna say is if you have not signed up for Rankin and Ninja, and you wish to do so,  and by the way, you don't need to use Rankin and Ninja. You can use whatever you want. Just so  you know, by the way, the way that we train this up until now has been use whatever tool you want,  whatever one floats your boat, whatever one frickin different strokes for different folks.  But it's going to be much easier for you guys if you want to use Rankin and Ninja because our  version 3.0 is going to be built entirely off of that because that's what I use exclusively now.  But if you didn't want to get that or sign up for that, you guys can message me. I have a new code  for those of you that haven't ever signed up for the 20% off for two months. Send me a private  message. I'll give you the code. So just as a heads up, Gina Benson just got into the house.  What's up, Gina Benson? Good to have you. Okay. So the reason I wanted to bring Porter on is,  and we're gonna talk about the commonalities of winners, is Porter's in a unique spot because  most of the people between him and Jason, most of the people that join our program, most people that  join this community now are going through Porter and Jason at some point. They're talking to them  on a phone call before they get on a call with Kyle. And also, for those of you that have been  in this group a while, you guys remember last year Porter was doing, he was the accountability  coach and he was jumping on calls with people who would, basically he was holding people accountable  and he was getting to really know the group. And we actually, there's a good chance we're gonna be  bringing that back because we're redoing the training and going into 3.0 and changing the way  we do everything. He's not doing that this second because we don't want to start and stop. But  anyway, I wanted to bring him on because he has a unique perspective. He's talked to a lot of the  people in this group. And so I wanted to go ahead and talk about some of the things that he's seen  that are the commonalities, and I said it in the group or as the title, the commonalities of winners.  One of the things that all the people that are having great success have in common. And then we're  gonna talk about the things that people that are not having success have in common and we're gonna  kind of dissect that a little bit. I hate when people use a bunch of quotes and that, you know,  oh and so and so Napoleon Hill said this and freaking MJ DiMarco said that and you know that  bugs me. But I will say that some of these quotes, as annoying as they are, I believe",

    "pageContent": "that they make  sense and I've lived by them. And so one of the quotes that I heard many years ago, it was really  cool when I heard it because I hadn't heard it 7,000 times. But the quote is success leaves clues.  So forget about it being cliche, it's true. And it's like if somebody else is winning,  just freaking do what they do, right? If somebody's making a million dollars a month,  then I just need to look at what they do and I need to figure out what are those clues and the  things that they're doing that I'm not. And, and this is Hermosy that really taught me this,  what are the things that they're not doing that I'm doing? I used to think there's things that I  wasn't doing enough stuff I needed to start doing and I realized a lot of times it's the things that  I am doing that I shouldn't be doing. It's the extra stuff, you know, that I just need to cut  out. What do I need to cut out? So yeah, Porter, let's go through that. What's the first thing  that comes to your mind when I ask you like of all the people that you know that are successful,  that you've talked to on an accountability call, on a call before they sign up with Kyle,  what is the one, what is one thing to start that you would say most everyone has in common  out of curiosity? I would say the people that, that you're mentioning, I think they all have  this, this strong desire and like this faith that they're going to be able to make a lot of  money. Like they, they're pretty gung-ho about making it work and they're tired of the  circumstances they're in. Everyone I talk to, they're like, you know, I have this job, it's  not paying enough. I want the freedom. I'm not able to go on the trips. I'm not able to do the  things that I enjoy. And so that's like the number one leading motivator. I feel like for mostly  everyone is just having that, you know, that money. But I think the hardest thing from holding them  back is just their own heads that they're afraid to spend the money to make money. They're so in  their head that I have this money and I would rather go on a trip than, you know, invest in  myself sometimes, even though it's, it sounds stupid, but it's hard to, you know, go out and  start your own business. So Porter used a very strong and interesting word. He said the word  Whoever's read Think and Grow Rich know that that word has got to be used. I bet there's a statistic.  I bet that word's used so many hundreds of times. I'm going to ask Google how many times  is the word desire used in Think and Grow Rich? Somebody out there has, has looked this up.  Okay. No one has put, wow, hold on. I would, I would have thought that, oh, by the way, dude,  if you guys are complaining about Think and Grow Rich, you can literally go online, type in Think  and Grow Rich, and you can get the freaking PDF. So, okay, I'm not seeing any number, but I will  say that there, that thing has got to be used probably in the first chapter 50 times. Just so  everybody knows. The point being, though, to tap into what Porter said, guys, is that  I'm not going to give away Think and Grow Rich, but that's a very important word for this book.  But this is what I say, you know, I used to do all the calls when people",

I said 50. Some of the people that  are on this call right now, I was the one that brought them into this group. And I will tell you  this, guys, is that you would think that the difference between the people that are crushing  it and the people that aren't is like something like they have sales experience, they have,  you know, I don't know, they're, they grew up a certain way, they, their parents are this,  their parents are not that, you know, whatever. But the truth is, guys, and I always used to say  this to people is that the people that succeed are always the ones that have the greatest reason  why they should succeed. And I would also say that you could use the word desire. And I used to always  say to people like, and this is the thing I would look for, I wouldn't get on these calls or look  through applications. And this is the same with business owners, by the way, but I wouldn't look  at it and go, Oh, have they had sales experience? Have they had technical experience? I would be  looking at someone's application. And I was looking to know, I was like, what the heck is  driving this person? What is their why? What is the reason why they want to do this? And the greater  the why, the stronger the why, the more confident I was, and the more flexible I was willing to be  to get them inside of the program, because I knew that they would have success. And on the contrary,  I didn't care if they were making dog crap for money, because I knew that they would start  making money if they had that strong why. And I always used to use this example. And I would say  this to people, I'd say, and I used to say this to business owners, this is a little one, a good  one liner or good little example you can use. When you guys are talking to your business owners,  you want to position it like you're almost interviewing them. Like you have a stack of  people lined up and you're trying to decide why you should work with them. This is, you got to  put yourself in a position of leverage. And I would always say to people, I would say,  if I asked you right now, Mr. Business Owner, or let's say I was talking to a potential student,  I would say, if I asked you, let's say we're at the top of a skyscraper and there's a skyscraper  across from us that's 20 yards like over into the other skyscraper. And I put a, let's imagine  there was a really strong two by four that wide going across into the other building. And I said  to you, I'll give you $10,000 to cross into that building and go across the wood. Important,  if I asked you that question, let's say we're on the 47th floor, we're in New York, we're in Vegas,  skyscraper to skyscraper, $10,000 across the two by four, two by four is going to be sturdy.  You're not going to shake off the two by four, but it's this thin. Would you take the deal?  Yeah. For $10,000?  Yeah. Dude, I don't know if I'd do it for $10,000.  I wouldn't. Heck no, dude.

    "pageContent": "way too valuable. So then I would always ask,  I'd say, okay, let me change the scenario. Same exact situation, two by four, no $10,000,  but your daughter or your mom is in the other building and it's on fire.  And the only way that you're going to save them is if you get over there. Now, obviously that  probably wouldn't make sense in a real scenario because you're not going to be able to fly off  the building with them. But let's just say it solved the problem. If that was the case,  every single person, I imagine, unless you just hate your mom or hate your kid, which I  never really met anyone that hates their kid, but every single person, if it was $0 on the line,  but it was someone's life at risk that they really loved, they would take that deal.  They wouldn't even think twice about it. Right? Very true. Same situation, same risk, actually  there's no money on the line, but the Y is greater. That's the only difference. And guess what? You  are going to see people move mountains to get across there. So the point being, guys, is that  the people that are successful in this business, they have the greatest reason to be successful.  So here's a question I want to ask Porter. And by the way, if you guys have comments,  you guys have input, if you have whatever, go ahead and ask in the comments. I would love to  hear the feedback, but let's just say that you're somebody that's in the group or you just joined,  you've been in a while and you've kind of lost the reason. You've kind of lost the reason for  whatever the case, maybe it's just gone away. The desire has gone away. Maybe you've achieved  a certain level and you're not as motivated like you were. Like it's really exciting to get that  first deal, to get that first 10,000, for me to get that first million, for me to get, you know,  there were certain benchmarks that really got me excited. But let's say you've achieved them  and you don't have that strong Y anymore, or maybe your Y was something that was superficial  and it was like, I want to get that car, whatever, which by the way, isn't a very strong Y because  once you get it, then what, then what? How do you get, how in your opinion, do you acquire  that strong Y if you don't have it? That's hard because I think everyone has their own goals,  because I mean, you join this and maybe it's like, hey, if I get to 10,000, that's going to  supplement me enough. And like, you know, I'm not looking to make a hundred thousand a month.  It's hard to motivate that person. But what I would say is I think goals are so important,  especially like monthly goals, weekly goals, daily goals. I think if you're setting yourself  up for success and you're like, you're always checking things off the list. I know when you  set a goal out for eight months away, it's pretty hard to measure that. You need to set your long  goal and then your monthly goals and then, you know, your weekly and daily goals. But I would  just say like for me in that situation, when I've gotten stagnant and I feel like I haven't been as  focused, it's, I got to come back to the, I come back to the training. I start back over. I almost  rewatch the whole training again so that I can like catch this new fire. Cause every time I listen  to it, it's like,",

    "pageContent": "why am I not doing more of this? Whenever I land a deal and like, if I just do this  10 more times, I'm going to be at this point, you know? So it motivates me just to get that one more  deal. But I would say get one more deal. Just do, you don't need to get to 10 or like 20 more  thousand dollars. Just get one more deal and then one more deal. Like just keep, keep putting that  stuff in front of you. And that may work for some, but I do think goals for me is the only way that  I could ever stay motivated and think about what would my life be like if I stopped doing this?  And then that kind of motivates me to keep doing this, you know? Like I don't want to go back to  where I was. I want to keep growing. I don't want to lose my deals that I have. And so yeah, I would  say that would be like my motivating factor. I really like that a lot. I know that we're not  going to talk a ton about goals, but one thing that really helps, and we talked about this many  times and it's something that I did and I stopped doing and I regret that I stopped doing it, but  not just writing your goals down, but actually reading them and reading them at least twice a  day, one in the morning, one at night. It sounds stupid. It sounds cliche. It is, but it works.  And there's a reason why people do it. Okay. Another thing I want to mention, and this is  something that I think changes everything because some people are like not, let's say some people  aren't motivated. They're like, I don't know. I just don't really have that fire that I used to  have, or I never really had it, or I don't know how to get it. Guys, one thing that I know is that  if you get around people that are playing at a much higher level, you are by force going to  either be inspired or discouraged. And depending on the type of person that you are, some people  get discouraged. Some people get inspired. If you're a discouraged person by other people's success,  then that's probably indicative of your entire life. For me, when I get around people that are  freaking crushing it and just bawling out, it shows me how small I am, how insignificant my  quote unquote success has been. And I'm like, dude, I got to freaking pick this up.  You know what I mean? When I'm thinking I'm big shot because I make a couple hundred thousand  dollars a month, and then I'm around people that are making a million dollars a month,  and I realize that, dude, I'm just to pee on, dude. These people are dropping millions of  dollars into projects and into companies and starting new companies, sometimes quarterly  with multi-million. Dude, that gets me freaking fired up and shows me how small I'm playing.  And then when I sit there and I'm with my same group of friends or I'm with a group of friends  that make me comfortable, that are a bunch of freaking screw-offs that I've known forever that  aren't going anywhere, or maybe they are, but they're just not going anywhere right now,  it's really easy to get complacent thinking you're the big hog on the saddle. You know what I mean?  For you, Porter, you live in Parowan, which is a great spot, it's nice, whatever, but you got to  be careful for those of you that are in towns you grew up in or around. Parowan, the downside  with somewhere like that is there's just not a lot of people",

That's a win, but that's the biggest win of their life. I married  someone not my cousin. It's like, no, dude, no. But it's this complacency of like, dude, you got  a little house and whatever. And so you've got to force yourself to get around people  who are playing at a bigger level. Some of you guys are in situations and in cities and in  environments where it's much easier. I know when I go to Dubai, I see five Lamborghinis a day.  I realize like, dude, I'm nothing. And by the way, I'm not sure if any of that money's real.  I think it's a lot of drug money. I'm not really sure how people make money in Dubai. But nonetheless,  I'm seeing Lamborghinis. They're coming from somewhere. And that inspires me. I'm seeing  the price of a villa being $6 million. Like these things, I see that going out for dinner,  you're spending $300 every single time. And these things inspire me. And some of you guys that live  in cities like that, it's easier to get inspired. Some of you guys that don't, like for example,  when I'm in Freetown, it's like, you don't have to have a ton of money to be the biggest dog in town.  So you have to be careful. And it's one of the things I think can really, really help you. So  as you guys are setting your goals, you're thinking about next year, you know, one of the goals that  I have so far is I want to network with, I think I put 10 people that are making a certain amount  of million dollars per year. Like their net worth is $10 million plus. And that's one of my goals.  And there's different ways that you can do that. And there's different things that you can do.  There's different strategies that you can have. And by all means, please, for the love,  do not start messaging people and asking to pick their brain.  Please lunch. Hey, you want to go to lunch? You want to grab lunch and I can pick your brain  like you're doing me a favor to buy me a $7 meal. Come on. You know what I mean? You got it. You  got to think about what can you do? This is the this isn't a by the way, this isn't a live on  networking, but you got to think about what what do the people that I want to connect with,  what do they all need? And what's something that I can add value to them by doing? What is something  that they all would need? Because there's some people, you guys know this, have really,  really strong networks with high network individuals. And there's certain people  that are in certain businesses that by nature they are in, they have just amazing networks.  There's actually a student in here that just joined. And he does, he goes and he buys  exotic cars. And he has a dealer license and all this stuff. And he has he's super young,  I'm going to try and get him on. He's stud, super young kid. I think he's 21 years old.  This dude has one of the strongest frickin networks that I know he knows that all the  big players in town. He knows he is like, I bet you his Rolodex is frickin ridiculous.  But it's because he's in a business that is attractive. And again, this is there's",

    "pageContent": "a reason  why he's in this business because that business is not recurring. But that's something that he  does. That's like his job, right? That's his business before he got into this, where he's  something that is attractive to people with money, right? There's people that do jet charters.  There's people that are in the luxury watch business. These are all things that a lot of  wealthy people are interested in. And I'm not saying by all means, don't do not go and  shiny object, I'm going to start flipping watches and this and that's not what I'm saying.  What I'm saying is think about how you can add value to these people, start building a strong  network and start frickin getting outside of your little teeny life. One of the reasons I like to  travel is when I do my mind is blown. My mind is expanded. I look at all its levels, man,  and you meet some most interesting people. Like I think I told you guys this story. I met  somebody from the royal family or whatever, the oil family in Saudi Arabia,  looking at their car collection, looking at frickin kids 18 years old driving a yellow  Canary yellow Lambo just for fun. He didn't buy, of course. That gets me pumped and I'm like,  okay, his parents are frickin ballin out. You know what I mean? So anyway, that's a really  important point, guys. What I would do this year as you guys are thinking about your goals  is revisit your why. Revisit your why. Sit down with yourself, turn off the distractions, sit down  with a pen and paper, maybe put on some light concentration music from Spotify and ask yourself  why, why, why? What do you want is the most important and hardest question to answer in  this life? Ask yourself, what do you want? For me in 2019, I said I want $100,000 per month  and I said, why? And then I answered it. And then I said, well, why do I want, why, why to that  answer? And why did that answer? And I just tried to dig like really far down. And by doing this,  I discovered some things about myself that like how I tick, what drives me, all these different  things. And it allowed me to just like, for every time things got tough, I could just remember,  okay, that's exactly why I'm doing it. So anyway, this isn't about a why. So that's really,  really interesting. So basically everyone that you've seen accountability, like in these  accountability calls, on these calls before they joined, they are, they have a strong desire,  but I would guarantee it's linked to a strong why. Is that fair to say? Yeah. Okay. What do  you think on the flip side is the commonality of losers, the commonality of the people that  get in the program and, you know, within a month, they stop doing it. Within a month,  they're distracted. Within a month, they're messaging me. Oh, I can't find the answer to  this. Or I can't, my ads, they're just not cranking. It's like, dude, what'd you expect  it just to work perfect the first time? It's like, bro, I'm sitting over at 1.5 million,  like just relax, it's going to come through. And they want to blame everything else, every other  situation under the freaking stars, except for themselves. What is that the commonality of the  losers, bro? I would say they, I don't know what the right word for that is, but they don't,  they definitely",

They definitely don't  work as hard because I think a lot of people get in this group and they don't find the city within  the first couple of days. And they kind of are like, dude, there's just no cities. Like it's too  saturated. And they've tried, they've tried one niche, they haven't think outside the box. Like  everyone's thinking the exact same thing. And if you can't find a city, you guys start thinking a  little differently to find a city. And so I would say a lot of it's in your own head and it's like  a dumb answer, but it's so true. It's like, you guys are just so afraid to work hard almost. Like  you're afraid to give this everything you have and make this the only thing that's going to make  you money. Like you can do have part-time jobs, but you got to treat it as if this is your only  thing. And when you do that, you really start taking more seriously. Like when I was like,  okay, I'm going to make this work no matter what. And I don't care how long it takes me. I got to  deal with in the first month, you know, but it was just my mindset of like being fearless enough to  be like, Hey, I'm just going to spend the money. Like, I know I don't have an excess amount of  money. Like I'm not just going to throw it against the wall, but like, it's okay. Like if I lose a  little bit of money, it's fine. And when I had that mindset, I, you start to just piggyback off  these deals that you get. Yeah, I agree. I think another thing I want to mention really, really  quick is the people that struggle the most, they have, they have this mindset. I'm going to call  it the, if it works mindset. Okay. That's a, if this works or if this thing happens, then blah,  blah, blah. So, you know, if I'm at a thousand, if I'm at my first deal within 30 days, then I'm  going to keep doing this. You know, if this thing happens by the end, it's like this, if it's like,  no, no, no, no, no, no. If you would just change that guys, the moment that I change this, and I,  I'm trying to not sound like Mr. Frickin rah rah, because I promise you, when I get on Instagram,  when I see fricking YouTube videos and every person is now somehow a guru motivational speaker.  Have you noticed that by the way, just as a side brand real quick? Definitely feel like there's a  lot more in the last couple of years. And I want to just publicly apologize if I ever came across  like that, which I know I did. I really hope at the time I wasn't trying to be that person. I was  just passionate because I literally, last night, even some of these people that have a lot of  followers, like I was listening to, oh, what's his name, dude? Okay. It was, I found this,  I found this podcast. I was looking at my area, St. George, Utah, and there's this podcast  interviewing like, basically it's a hyper-focused podcast on St. George, Utah. And it's like,  because it's only focusing on St. George, Utah, their pool to pull from of interviewing of guests  is very small. And I'm looking and I know, I recognize some of the people and I'm like,  why the hell are we interviewing the fricking",

But he's like, dude, you don't need a podcast, spoiler alert,  you don't need a podcast, you don't need a podcast. It's just annoying at this point. Okay.  It's very annoying. So I just wanted to throw that in there. Guys, we're not trying to be on  here thinking that we're fricking bee's knees, hot crap. We know everything. Dude, we're just  trying to figure this out like you guys are, but we have learned a few things. We've observed a  couple things. So I just, I'm trying to just let you know that I know how cringe some of the stuff  I probably have said. I'm just trying to be the fricking messenger. Shout out to Kanye, right?  He's the messenger. He's the espresso, as he says. But dude, in 2019, this is from experience,  not from me reading a book. 2019, I had my back up against the wall, $60,000 in debt,  thinking about quitting, thinking about going to be a salesperson, which by the way, no shame on  being a salesperson. But the reason why I had shame around it is because I was thinking about  quitting. That's really what it was. I was thinking about quitting. And I sat down with myself,  yellow notepad. You guys know the story. What do you want? Just shared it. And I changed my  mentality because I realized at that moment, this was the model. I had the right model.  I just needed to figure a few things out. And up until then, although I was doing it,  I still had one foot out, one eye kind of on the streets. And I was never all in. I was never  faithful. Let's just use an analogy of being faithful in a relationship. I was cheating on  my main thing. I had my eye in the streets, and I was always looking for that better thing.  And it made it so I could never succeed. I could never go all in. And the only thing that had to  happen is I had to just look at it and go, this is the right model. I just got to figure this out.  And I changed from, I remember, I got this new energy. I got this new excitement. I had this new  energy to like, this is it. I just have to do it long enough. And I have to be willing for this to  take forever. I have to be willing for me to just realize I'm going to be doing this forever,  period. And as soon as I did that, guys, everything changed. The way that I approached  my day changed. The way that I approached doing due diligence. I no longer felt like it was this  thing I was trying to check out the box. I was like, no, I got to master due diligence.  I started looking at my ads, and instead of being annoyed, I was like, I want to master. I want to  become so good at ads. I want to get a little bit better, a little bit better. I want to be able to  do them in five minutes and 31 seconds, which I used to be able to do when we were doing the  smart campaigns. And every fast of the business, I became obsessed with. And you guys know when",

I'm going to do it for  three months. I'm going to do it whatever, until I'm good. I'm doing this until it works.  I just knew deep down this is the right model. And here's the advantage you guys have that I didn't.  I didn't know anyone that was doing $100,000 a month. I didn't know anyone that was doing  $30,000 a month. I saw people posting checks, but I promise you that they were lying. You know when  you can tell someone's lying when they say it and it's like, bro, how much you really making, right?  People in here making freaking $70 million a second these days, according to Instagram,  right? They're full of crap. I didn't have anyone. I didn't have Ryan Dalton making $87,000. It started  two years ago to be like, yo, if Ryan did it with a full-time job, kids and dog and jujitsu and all  this stuff, I can do it. I didn't have that, but I just knew deep down I could do it. But as soon as  I changed that, dude, everything freaking changed. I started just approaching the day different. I  started attacking the day different. I started getting up with a new zeal. I started staying up  late. I cut the Netflix during the week. Dude, everything changed, dude. All the other stuff  fell out, dude. I didn't care. I wasn't looking at other businesses. I wasn't ready to start other  businesses. That was all I had to change. That mindset shift was huge for me, okay?  Real quick, I want to talk about this as well. What do you think? This could be from people you've  talked to, people you've interacted with, but I think that one of the issues nowadays is that we  try to add all these extra things. We try to add... I got to do... And this is an extreme example. I'm  not trying to steal from Formosy or any of these guys, but they do a really good job making fun of  it. The cold plunge and this freaking one-hour routine and the meditation and the affirmations  and all this different stuff. I think it was a really fresh idea when Formosy was like,  you could also just wake up and walk into your office and work. That also works. Anyway, by the  way, I got nothing against cold plunge. I actually think it's rad. I just don't think you need to  post about it. That's it, okay? For the record, Ford, I know you got a cold plunger, but don't  be hiding that from anybody. Dude, consistently, dude. It's good for the joints. Dude, I would do  that. I'm all for the cold plunge. The point is, don't think that you need to do cold plungers to  make $10,000 a month, $50,000 a month. What I want to talk about really quick are what are some of  the things that you see people, they have a misconception about, what are some of the things  that people think they need to be doing that are just distractions, right? That's another thing  that I went... The years that I've really grown, dude, are the years where I sit there and I think,  what can I eliminate? That was another huge thing for me. I know we're talking about the  commonalities of winners, but I'm going to put myself in that. I've got to observe myself,",

I'm going to share some of the things that I simplified, but what do you think, Porter,  are some of the things that people, from what you've seen, need to simplify in their life,  need to get rid of to have the success to become a winner? Guys, it's ridiculous to know. If you're  watching this call right now, and you know that Porter's at $9,400 a month, and he's also farming  full-time, and you're not at five, you're not at one, you don't have a deal, and you've been  doing this for anywhere close to the same amount of time, that should really piss you off. It should  inspire you, and it should piss you off. No way, dude. No way I'm letting Porter do this, and I'm  not. You know what I mean? I used to do this about people as well, dude. It's good to have people on  your radar. Anyway, Porter, what do you think are some of the things that people need to cut out  that they're doing that they shouldn't be doing? Because we always talk about what you should add,  routine, 10 pages of a book, gallon of water, cold plunge, this pill, that pill, freaking  grounding, sun on the face, dude, watching Liver King, listening to Joe Rogan, like all the freaking  cliche stuff that all of us do, but some of us think that it's necessary to have success.  What are some of the things we need to cut? Again, observing other people. We're not being  influencers here. We're not being Tony Robbins here. We're just observing. We're just country  folk that are observing. Dude, I don't know if it was just me, and I guarantee if I say this,  if this is you, comment below, but how many times do you think you have to have this mile-long list  the next day? I would sit down and I would write and I would write down the most small things that  would not do anything to get me closer to moving the needle. It would be like doing due diligence  or like, I mean, that was, but like at the time I was doing so much due diligence that I wasn't  acting. I wasn't actually taking initiative. So I think simplify your list. And if you do a list,  if you do it to do list, pick three things or pick big things that you're going to be able to  do and just do them because you're going to get them done a lot faster. I would say,  eliminate social media. Like during your work, when you're working, I found that I look at my  phone a lot when I'm on my computer, I'll have my phone sitting and I'll be on computer. And if I  don't like set a timer or something to try to work for a certain amount of time. And I know  Hermosa does that. And he says, every time you get distracted, if you pause your timer,  you'll actually realize that you can do the same task in half as much time. And I'm like,  so the other day I was doing, I was setting up a campaign and I was kind of dreading it because I,  sometimes I have to go through, look at the training, you know, go back and forth.  And I really sat down and just did it. And it literally took me 15 minutes. And for whatever  reason, I thought it was going to take me an hour or whatever. It was 15",

    "pageContent": "minutes and I got so much  done. And it just took getting started for me to realize like, what am I doing? Like this is,  this is so simple, but I had to create, I create these long lists. So I think that I need to start  checking things off. And naturally you want to go after the smallest things possible because it  makes you feel good. It's like, make your bed. It's like, go to the gym. It's like, read, read  a book. And those are things that are pretty easy to do and you can check it off, but they're not  really getting you closer to your goals. So I would say for me, and I don't know most of you,  probably simplify your list, get rid of social media and just realize that it doesn't take you  as long as you think to get stuff done. That's a really, that's a really strong point.  And by the way, as you said that, Sean said, my biggest waste of time was doom scrolling. I deleted  TikTok and Instagram at seven AM this morning. Yes, yes, yes. And yes, guys, one of the things  that I do and I, I, I'm not perfect at this. And sometimes I catch myself like going a few days  and realizing, oh my gosh, I wasted a bunch of time. Even at, even where I'm at, I still catch  myself doing this. But one thing that I think is very important is to get, just get social media  off your phone, get it off your phone, turn it on to post, delete it, and then give yourself a  certain time every day where you can go and you can feel, you can not feel guilty by just scrolling  and just kind of unwinding if you want. Okay. But literally you got to set a 15 minute timer.  So what I try to do again, try, because I didn't even do this yesterday admittedly, but I did a  pretty good job last week is I delete it. It's deleted all day. And then I have this little time  timeline where I want to get on and post. I don't even write my post on Instagram.  I write my post in the notes app. And I also think of which stories I want to share  on my thing. So then what I do is I download Instagram, I copy and paste, I put the picture  in, I paste the, the, the, whatever the body of the text. And then I put the location, boom,  I post it. I go share a few stories. And within 20 minutes, I can have a nice post, all my stories.  And then guys, if I just delete it right after, cause I know some of you guys, it's so tempting  to sit there and go, who liked it? I wonder how cool they think I am. Like, let's be honest,  we've all done it, dude. Who's looking at my story? You don't pour it on admit you haven't done that  last week, dude. We all, we all, we're all guilty of it. Stupid dude. Like that gets us anywhere in  life, but we all do it. Right. And you're just sitting there and you're waiting for a little  freaking comment. And it's like, dude, you know, it's interesting. Just delete it. And then you go  in to make your post the next day, make your post, and then give yourself an extra five minutes to  read the comments and be like, Oh, I looked at who liked it in 15 seconds. I replied to the one  comment I got. Thanks mom. And that's it. And I just saved myself, not only the time of",

I'm speaking to myself. So true.  It's freaking happened. By the way, Sean said I give props to TikTok because it's how I found  the program. I just don't need it now. Yeah. A hundred percent. But by the way, when you do your  15 minutes, if you guys assume to do 15 minutes a day as of consuming, there's different levels of  it. Like there's stuff you can add value. I like to go and like listen to Theo Vaughn cause he's  freaking hilarious. Um, that's to me, that's value. That's entertainment. I'll take that over  Netflix. But also I think there's some interesting stuff like you can find on some of these  platforms and you don't just sit there and like consume or, you know, inspiring, interesting  educational. So there's different levels, but guys, let me just share this. Um, in 2020,  when I scaled up to a hundred thousand dollars a month, let me share some of the things I did.  Okay. Is social media. I basically just got rid of it. Okay. Like I don't even, I don't even know  if I posted. I'm sure I did, but I don't think I posted much. I don't think I consume much. I was  just tired of being broke. I got rid of that for the most part. Um, but more than that guys,  I got rid of a bunch of the things that you, they're, they're the silent killers.  Let me give you an example. Lunches with your, but with your business buds. Okay. I was because if  you guys work in an office, it's really easy to be like, dude, let's go meet for lunch, blah, blah,  blah. And guys, you, it takes two hours to meet for lunch. Like it just does. You got to drive  there. That's 10 minutes, 15 minutes, depending on where you live. You're going to order your food.  You're going to want to talk. It's going to be about an hour. Then you're going to do another  15, 20 minutes, get back to the office. And of course you got to grab you a soda, right? Pour  a little swig ski on the way back. There's another 10, 15 minutes. Then when you get in the office,  you got to chat, right? Jessica's at the front. She's got to ask me a question where I'm asking  her when she's going to Italy, dude, I'm two hours of my day to go and get lunch with somebody.  So in 2020, it helped that there was nowhere open, of course, at the beginning of the year,  because, you know, what restaurants were closed, there's only takeout. But even after things  started opening up, I just didn't do it. Okay. So I got rid of the BS lunches. Number two is I got  rid of all the hobbies. And I'm not saying that you need to do this and be fanatical forever,  but if you guys are not where you want to be, if you guys are not free or, and especially if you  haven't gotten your first deal, guys there that you can have a season of your life where you just  go locked in. You kind of do that. Like people call it monk mode or they go away in the wilderness  for a while. But if you just got into this program, you don't have a",

I did not do pickleball. I did not do  fricking basketball. Only thing I did is I went to the gym because that helped me with my business.  But I got rid of everything else. Okay. Another thing I got rid of is I got rid of watching  Netflix. Okay. I, by the way, I got rid of watching Netflix during the week, Monday,  Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday night, Saturday night, I can watch it. And boy,  did I watch, I blew through seasons, dude. I was times I woke up, I was like, dude, it's 4 30 AM,  dude. Eyes wired like I had taken, you know, five packs of Marl bros. I had a Zen in each  little pouch, dude, watch it. Just, I would hit seasons, bro. But at least it was,  it was very channel. Okay. Nothing during the week. Nothing's messing with my week. Okay.  Further than that, I kept eliminating. I got rid of all the extra services. I was done with SEO.  I was done with fricking social media management. I got rid of all of that.  Then I got rid of all my extra niches and I dialed in on one niche and I'm like,  I'm going to go one niche and then I'm going to sell these other websites that I,  that are generating leads. I got rid of all of my deal structures, paper lead gone, commission  gone. It was never really there anyway. Only flat fee. I got rid of all my pricing options,  a thousand dollars plus. I got rid of all my contract options. It's one six months at the  minimum. That's it. Boom. And guys, I had such a simple life. I would wake up,  gym was closed. Luckily my buddy, about a block away invited me. 7 a.m. I'd be at his gym.  We would work out for one hour. I would come back and get to work. I would work. I'd have  some lunch midday. I'd work some more. I'd be at the kids two, three hours. They'd go to bed.  I'd come back up to the office and that's it. And guys, in my work, like Porter said,  it wasn't fricking stupid stuff. Checking boxes. It was literally make calls, find new areas,  hook new business owners, close deals. Like that's what I focused on and everything else,  find someone to do it. And what do you know from 2019 December, eight to 10,000 bucks a month,  July, 2020, a hundred thousand dollars a month. No coincidence.  Simplicity is more simple and more. Yeah. Less is more. More is less. 100%  Gina says, I'm totally guilty of using Instagram, especially as a distraction,  beating myself up right now, along with you right now. It's such a waste of time. I get so much done  when I had my phone. Yeah. And guys, I think if you're intentional about it, like give yourself  some time, maybe if it's 30 minutes at night, say, Hey, every night when everything's done,  I plan my day. I would recommend not doing it in bed, but like, I'm going to give myself 30  minutes. Maybe sip on your fricking nightly lemon and ginger tea with a little drop of Manuka honey.  That'll put you to sleep. That'll put you on your behind.",

And I promise you when you wake up and you don't do fricking check your phone on who liked my post,  you're going to get a lot more done, but Gina, don't beat yourself up. We all do it. I fricking  did it yesterday. It's just one of those things we've got to remind ourselves. Jason says,  setting up a separate device for social media and removing them entirely from the device I  carry all day and the process that I speak. I love that. You know, when I shared this last thing  in 2022, I did this, this worked for a period of time. I don't know why I stopped doing it.  Maybe I should do it. And this isn't something that's necessary, but I actually went and got  a completely separate phone, separate number, everything. I actually got this from dad because  he does it too, or he was getting a bunch of calls from his church stuff. But I had this little  fricking tiny, I had another, it was a smartphone, but it was the little tiny one and it was a  different number and it had nothing on it and no one had my number. That's it. The only one that  had my number. I didn't even have it. You didn't have my number. My wife had my number in case  there was emergency. I think, I think, I think my dad and mom had my number. I think there was like  three people that had my number and guess what? That was the phone I used during the day. So I  knew that there was no emergencies happening, but I was, I was locked in, baby. I was locked in.  So again, that's an extreme example. If you, you can do that, but you don't need to do that. You  can also just not look at your phone. You can also just fricking turn it off. And that's it. And if  you have a spouse or a significant other that doesn't understand that you need to have a serious  talk, cause it's like, dude, we're making money during the day and then I'm going to be with you  at night. Okay. That's it. So guys, I hope you guys are excited as I am about 20 fricking 25.  We have another year ahead of us. We have, we have, we can, we can set new goals. We can go  achieve new things. This can be the year and you guys, your whole life can change in a year. You,  you can go from being somebody that's just getting by, having to calculate every time you take a  flight to literally owning the car of your dreams or owning an apartment complex that makes you  a certain amount of money. You guys, these are like, there's so much possibility and it's  fricking insane how much your life can change in one year. We have a new year ahead of us.  Let's not end this year. Just take our foot off the gas, but let's, let's, let's go strong and  let's get our goals done now. Let's not wait till January 31st or December 31st to have our goals.  I hope you guys are pumped. I hope you're excited. We have things that are making this  easier. We have people to show us Ryan Dalton, myself, you know, Mike V, some of these big  players that are making a lot of money that we can look to as examples, look at them for inspiration,  look at them for wisdom, look at them for what to do, what not to do.

By the way, we also have tools that are helping us  rank and run engine, which again, I'll just quickly, if you guys do not and have not already  messaged me for a discount code, if you haven't used one of those already, there's a new code  that Ryan set up. That, that can get so much more work done in such a shorter period of time,  just with the due diligence feature alone. So we have all these things, all these examples,  all this support. We're going to be coming out with a new version of the training that's going  to help us even more with accountability and everything else. A lot of exciting stuff. This  is the greatest business model on the fricking internet, guys. Let's see. Jason says, so how  many carriers these days give away a free phone with new lines and lines are cheap to add?  That's so true, dude. It's actually really true as you can easily do that. Freedom of time.  Leanne says the Opal app blocks anything you want for whatever hours you choose. That's dope.  That's a good little hack ski. Thanks, Leanne. I like that Opal. Also, if you guys don't already  do that, what's this app that I've had on my desktop for however long the,  hold on, I'll tell you exactly what it is. It's called the  the News Feed Eradicator. News Feed Eradicator. I can't even, like if I go to Facebook because  I have to be on Facebook, I can't see my timeline. It gives me some cheesy quote.  I can't see anything. I'm not scrolling because you guys know how easy it is to get it. And by  the way, Jason just said, oh yeah, brick too. By the way, if RIP, if RIP can use a brick phone,  Porter? With a flip phone, dude? You can do a flip phone and your stuff is bad freaking RIP,  you can use a flip phone. Dude, a flip phone's a vibe, dude. I'm going to go back to a Blackberry  at the very minimum. But yeah, Luke says plus one for the News Feed Eradicator. Guys, appreciate  you hopping on. Porter, thanks for hopping on. Sharing some nuggets. Hopefully we didn't come  across a bunch of freaking guru Tony Robbins wannabes. We're just a bunch of, like I said,  country boys with some moderate to crappy education that just are trying to be simple,  trying to make money, trying to make a little dent in this world. And hopefully you guys got  some value from this. So guys, appreciate you being on. Porter, thanks for being on.  We'll see you guys next time. Yeah.",

    "pageContent": " Like should you, should you not go into it because do you see a lead generator?  Is that what you're asking?  Yeah, exactly.  Because is there, is there at one point, uh, too many or too much competition?  So here's my theory is like, if, if everything checks out, right.  And I do the due diligence from what we talked about in module one and even with the lead  generators site or their, their organic site and their GMB, I do that sheet and it's still  open.  There's still opportunity to rank.  I could care less if you're a lead generator, if you're yellow pages, if you're Joe Schmo  down the corner, I don't care.  For me personally, I've gotten multiple deals where I've noticed one to two lead generators  sites.  Not only do I see their sites, but they're ranking on page one.  I still go into that niche.  I still build the site.  I still land a client that I've had for over two years.  I can think of two examples of done that.  So now, you know, if, if, if, if the lead generators are the only ones running ads,  that tells me that clearly there's a market because somebody's buying those beats.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It looks like it's going to be like a head on competition.  Yeah.  Well, that's the thing is go back to go back to module one though.  It does.  Does it still check the box?  Are those sites really?  Do they have good?  Do they have good backlinks?  Are they ranked?  No, no, no.  So like the backlinks are not there like the other people in the maps on page one as well.  No, then go for it.  Go for it.  Who gives a shit what they are.  I don't care.  I do not care who you are.  If, if that due diligence part checks out, I'm in.",

I like to give them a  lot of soft touches leading up six weeks, a month up. Sometimes I'll bump the ads up a little bit  just to make sure they have a really good month. And then we have the conversation. And I make sure  to have the conversation about four weeks to two weeks out so that if they don't want to renew,  I have time to go find somebody else. But yeah, make sure that that last two weeks,  four weeks before you have the chat is a good one. Okay. And not only that you send them a  lot of leads, but that they're actually closing deals. You got to make sure to stay in touch with  these people. Make sure to have a lot of soft touches during that first six months.

So yeah, I mean, the way I look at it, guys, is this, right?  If you guys get in that situation where you're like, man, of course, Nick can do 24K in a  month.  He's got money to run.  I do.  But guys, remember that in 2019, not only did I not have money to run ads, I had $60,000  in debt.  And not only did I have $60,000 in debt, I had two car payments and not only did I have  two car payments, I had a house payment and I had a wife and I had a couple of kids and  I had this and I had that and I had bills and I think all the stuff and my wife just  because I didn't have money didn't mean she doesn't want to go on vacation and she wasn't  on Instagram and she wasn't talking to her friends who are going to Disneyland.  Guys, I've been there.  Okay.  So my encouragement is that you have to look at it like, okay, first of all, let's not  be stupid.  Let's not go blow money, obviously, but also at the same time, let's just be really good  about where we put our money.  And yes, for the first little bit, it might feel like it's running at a snail's speed,  but guess what?  Once you get that first deal, it opens up a little cash and then instead of taking the  cash and just go blowing it on something stupid, let's put it back in the business.  And now maybe we can run too, but we're going to be smart about it.  We're not just going to go burn in cash and boom, we got two deals.  Okay, cool.  Things are starting to go and now maybe we need to get a VA, right?  So I think the thing I would tell you is like, the encouragement is I was there.  I was there in 2019 when I was figuring this out.  I was like, dude, what do I have to work with?  What can I sell?  What can I do?  Which one of my sites that I built in another program is generating some leads that fits  the criteria and has low CPC.  And yeah, for the first couple of months running this strategy, guys, I was doing them one  at a time.  Literally, it was one at a time until we went and said, let's do 10K in a month.  And then we started doing two or three.  So I think it gets frustrating.  We see everyone else smash the deal, smash the deal, smash the deals.  Trust me, guys.  I know that it could get frustrating, but also you got to realize just because it's  taking you, whoever you are to get your first, it's taking you longer.  I heard this quote one time and it gets over quoted, but like, I think it's we overestimate  what we can do in a year and we underestimate what we can do in five.  And some of you guys are overestimating what you can do in one month or two months or six  months.  Guys, if I would have stopped, I started doing this in 2016.  If I would have stopped, if I would have at the year two mark or the year three mark,  if I would have stopped and been like, well, guys, at the end of year three, I had made  a couple hundred grand in three years.

Or this one's probably one that people get more often  is why do I need you when I can build my own website?  Seems easy enough.  And I guess my clarification,  and I'm gonna make some assumptions here,  but my clarification is like,  are we building websites or are we generating leads?  So I'm assuming that you're talking about generating leads.  And if the business owner,  if that's just wasn't clarified, then that's fine.  But let's say the business owner said,  why do I need you if I can just build my own website  and get my own leads?  Then my question or my response to that would be like,  if you honestly, sir, if you can do that,  then you should go do that by all means, by all means.  But like, why haven't you done that yet?  Right?  Like that makes zero sense.  Like, and so I don't think I've ever got the second one.  Why would like, why do I need you?  Then I guess my question would be like,  well, then why are you paying home advisor?  If you could do it, why haven't you done it yet?  Right.  And I'm not gonna,  I know that like a lot of people want me to go,  probably say, well, you should focus on your business  and I'll focus on mine.  It's like, no, call them out.  Okay, Bob, go do it.  And guess, I'd probably kind of be a little bit,  I'd probably be a little tongue in cheek here  and I'd go, I'd say something like along the lines of like,  oh, I didn't know you had that skillset.  If you have that skillset,  like I'm looking for good people.  Why don't you just build the website  and then I'll buy the leads from you?  No, seriously, because I think I can go get,  sell them somewhere else for hire.  Like, and honestly, if you know how to build them,  then do it A for yourself and then we should talk  because maybe you can help me with some of these webs.  Like they're full of crap, okay?  That's number one.  The first part of it, which was,  what was the first part of that question?  Which was, what was it?  Can you teach me to build my own website?  Is that what you're referring to?  Oh, yeah.  If they ask that, I would just say, yeah, I can.  But like, are you, you just want a website?  Again, is it, can you,  can you teach me to build my own website  or can you teach me to get leads?  Because there's a big difference  between getting leads and building a website.  Because if you just want to build a website,  then why don't you just go to GoDaddy  and throw up a website.  But guess what?  A website for a website's sake is a waste of money.  If your website's not generating leads,  why do you have a website?  Yeah.  Yeah, and the only other thing I'd add to that is,  one, they're probably not qualified.  So it's probably a business owner  that you would want to work with in the first place.  But then it also just goes back to the monopoly model  that we talked about.  Like, hey, the whole goal is to get your property,  our property, and you get as many leads as possible. ",

    "pageContent": " You're overthinking everything.  He says, I guess it's the GMB that throws me for a loop.  Why does that?  And you don't have to answer this.  This is a rhetorical question for everybody.  I have not lost a second of sleep over a GMB, guys.  There's three ways to get leads on Google.  There's paid ads, there's the Google My Business,  AKA the Maps, and there's organic.  Guess what?  99% of the people out there  don't know how to run Google Ads.  All the people doing rank and rent  don't know how to run Google Ads.  So guess what?  Their only chance is organic and maps.  And guess what?  Maps just got taken.  So they have one.  And when I say taken, there's still ways to get ranked,  or there's still ways to get verified, obviously,  but it's not as easy as it was  where you just throw it up and it goes.  They only have one way to get leads, right?  Guess what?  It may not be as easy for us to get the GMB,  but we still have ads.  We still have organic.  So that's why I'm saying focus on  how competitive is the organic?  Because if you can get ranked organically  and you can get the ads to supplement,  you will be fine.  In 2020, I don't know how many projects I had  by the time I was making 100K,  but I will tell you that more than half of those  did not have a verified GMB.  We were making money.  We had contracts that business owners were happy  strictly on ads and organic.  And a lot of the organic was taking a while to catch up.  So guys, stop stressing about that.  Don't give up on it.  Not saying to stop trying to figure out ways  that are ethical, that are white hat,  that are above board,  but don't sweat it.  I've never even lost a second of sleep on this whole,  everyone's in their freaking pants about this.  Like, what are we going to do?  What are we going to do?  Just quit stressing, okay?  And I know that's hard  because I'm a stressor when certain areas,  but I'm just telling you for this,  don't stress, okay?",

    "pageContent": " All right guys, step one of the perfect prospecting script is who you are and the pattern interrupts.  There's three questions that we're going to ask, but first what we're going to do is we're  going to do a pattern interrupt.  What I mean by that is back when I was doing door-to-door sales, as I like to relate a  lot of these stories, is we would knock on the door knowing people hated us.  People hate door-to-door people, just like your business owners.  These business owners that we talked to, they hate people calling their phone.  They just do not like it.  We got to look at what is everybody else doing and how do we do it differently?  One thing that we would do back when we did door-to-door is we knew we were already at  a disadvantage.  People hated door-to-door people, but there was a specific type of door-to-door that they  loathed and that was magazine guys.  I've never seen a magazine girl, that's why we call it magazine guys.  They were sketchy, they were scammy, they always stole your money.  People just hated them.  One of the pattern interrupts I use, and I'm just giving you an example, is I'd knock  on the door and be like, hey, my name's Nick, I'm with Vivint.  By the way, Vivint's the company I used to work for, by the way, I'd say, by the way,  I'm not the magazine guy, don't worry, and I'd put my hands up like this.  If I got a laugh out of people, I knew I had some air time.  I'm like, yeah, let me show you what I'm doing real quick.  I got right into it, transitioned in, but it was all about interrupting that pattern  instead of just being the guy that's like, hey, my name's Nick, I'm with a company called  Vivint, and we're doing home security, like guys, that is so cringe, okay, and likewise,  and this is the first thing I want to talk about before we get into anything, is the  one thing you're not gonna do is you're not gonna call and drop the name of your agency  and be salesy, okay?  This is a bad, this is what you don't want to do.  Hi, Jake, this is Nick with Evergreen Enterprises, and I'm calling you about lead generation.  Okay, bad, stop, do not do that, okay?  Here's how we're gonna pattern interrupt.  We're gonna look at what everyone else is doing, okay?  Think about it, what's everyone else doing?  Everyone else, home advisor, angelist, et cetera, they're calling and they're saying,  yeah, hey, is this the business owner?  Hey, Mr. Business Owner, and they go into this BS pitch about ranking on page one and  this and that, and it's roundabout and it's all this different stuff.  The way that we're gonna be, we're gonna do this pattern interrupt is we're gonna go firing  right in, asking them questions, okay?  We're gonna be direct and we're gonna ask them questions and we're gonna ask them three  questions.  Our pattern interrupt is intertwined with these three questions, okay?  So, first question that you're gonna ask is you're gonna ask if they do a specific service  within the service.  So, for example, if you're doing concrete, you're gonna say, hey, Jake, Nick here, quick  question, do you guys do patios, okay?  Do you guys do patios and driveways?  Or, hey,",

    "pageContent": "Jake, Nick here, do you guys do tree removal or just tree trimming?  Do you guys actually do the removal or do you guys do stump removal, okay?  You're gonna ask a question pertaining to the service, okay?  You almost wanna make it seem like they're gonna think, is this a customer?  Is this a contractor?  Is this, like, they don't know, okay?  Is this a lead gender?  They're not gonna know.  You're gonna pattern interrupt because you're gonna go right into it.  You're gonna take advantage.  Instead of pitching them, you're gonna ask questions, okay?  If someone else wants to pitch, we're gonna ask questions, okay?  Hey, Jake, do you guys do patios?  Awesome, okay?  That's question one.  Ask about the service, okay?  All right, guys, second question.  You're gonna ask that question and then the second question you're gonna ask is if they  cover a specific area.  The best way I've found, yes, you can say, hey, do you cover this zip code, but what  I think is better is knowing the area and using, like, a suburb name.  That's like, it's gold.  So, for example, I live in a city called St. George and if you look at the map, you're  gonna see there's a main city, St. George, then I live in Washington, technically.  It's actually St. George, but everyone would say I live in Washington.  Then there's a place called Santa Clara.  These are technically cities with their own zip codes, but within St. George, okay, I  live in this area called Little Valley, okay?  Everyone just calls it Little Valley.  So what I would say, like, let's say I was targeting Vegas.  After I asked, hey, do you do patios, cool, awesome, and you guys cover Summerlin, right?  Like, I'm targeting Vegas, but I'm gonna ask, do you guys cover Summerlin?  Now what this is gonna do, it's, first of all, again, they're just like, what the heck?  Secondly, you wanna make sure that this customer is gonna be interested in that lead, okay,  because it's in Summerlin.  Now don't ask about some stupid area.  Ask about the area the lead is in, okay?  So if the lead is actually in Las Vegas, go ahead and ask about the street.  Hey, do you guys cover Silver Beach Circle?  That's the street I live on.  Do you guys cover Silver Beach Circle, okay?  They're like, what, where's that?  Zip code's 84790, okay, cool, yeah, yeah, yeah, we do.  Okay, that's question two.  Question one is a question about the service.  Question two is a question about the area.  Question three, you're gonna ask them how far out they are, okay?  Okay, awesome, last question for you.  How far out are you with giving service?  Like, how far out are you to do an actual trigger mobile?  How far out are you pouring concrete?  I know it's really busy, like, are you guys gonna be able  to take anything before this decade's over?  Like, sometimes I'll joke.  Can you guys actually cover, can you get to something  before the end of this fiscal year?  Like, holy crap, like, I'll kind of joke to them.  They're like, oh, yeah, yeah, we are a little backed out.  And they're like, oh, two months.  Oh, no problem, not a big",

We can do that in 24 hours.  We can do that next week, cool, okay?  And these are what you're gonna do.  You're gonna ask these three questions  and then you're gonna do a miniature transition, okay,  into the second step.  Now, I don't wanna confuse you  because I told you that there's four main parts to this,  right?  Who you are, which is part of the pattern interrupt,  what you're doing, okay, damn good reason, the deal,  and then I said transition, and now I'm telling you  there's miniature transitions, there is.  Between each one of these steps,  there's just these miniature transitions  because you don't wanna just pause, okay?  So you get done, okay, cool,  it's 24 hours to give an estimate.  And then what you're gonna do is you're gonna transition  into why you're calling.  Awesome, Jake, so anyway, the reason I'm calling you,  okay, you're gonna get into why you're calling  and that's gonna be, that's gonna segue us  into the next step.  So, guys, don't be, recap, don't be salesy,  don't use your agency name, just get to the point.  Our pattern interrupt is we're gonna ask three questions,  bang, bang, bang, and we're gonna transition  into why we are calling,  and we're gonna be giving a damn good reason  why the hell we're calling.",

    "pageContent": " Guys, welcome to this little impromptu live that I'm running.  I didn't plan on doing this, but I wanted to share a couple things.  So I didn't make any kind of an announcement in terms of me going live or anything like  that.  Okay.  So what I wanted to share really, really quick, by the way, it's December 2nd.  We have takeout Christmas and New Year's Eve and Christmas Eve.  We have like three, a little over three weeks of working time left in this year.  And you know, a lot of people in this group, a lot of people in business in general, a  lot of our clients are a lot of people that we want to work with or potentially work with.  They might be just like taking their foot off the gas.  And so this is a time where you can either take your foot off the gas, which if that's  what you choose to do, that's completely fine.  I used to be so frustrated when I would think about people doing this.  But this business, we do this business so that we can choose the kind of life and lifestyle  that we want.  So I have no problems with that if that's what you choose to do.  But for some of us, like myself, I'm trying to put my foot on the gas.  I'm trying to go as fast as possible to the very, very end so that I start the year now.  Okay.  So let me go ahead.  I want to tag everyone real quick.  Let's go like this.  Come quick.  Come quick.  That's what I said.  So I just barely got done this morning.  I woke up.  One of the things I wanted to do that was on my priorities this week and as like one  of my to-do's this week that I needed to get done is I wanted to go and review my goals,  my 2024 goals.  Now, the first thing, the first problem with this and what I just said is the fact that  I needed to go and review, which means that it's been a long time since I've done this.  And I'm going to be completely transparent with you guys.  I think it was, man, at the beginning of this year, I was, make sure you're checking your  goals every once in the morning, once at night.  I think we had Zach Powell on, I think it was like when I was in Africa about the spring  or something like that.  And he was talking about checking your goals every six hours.  And I love that.  I love that idea of that.  And I did it for a while.  And then I got off path and I got off track and I got distracted.  And anyway, today, it's kind of like, I don't know if you guys have ever been in a position  where you know that your bank account isn't great and you like avoid looking at it, even  though you know what's in it.  You don't want to look at it.  I remember back in 2019, 2018, I hated logging into my account because it just kind of highlighted  the fact that I was in such a bad situation.  And then once I got in there, it was manageable, but it was always like I was trying to avoid  it.  So anyway, today I knew I was like, I got to get down, I got to look at my goals, see  where I'm at, see how I can course correct, et cetera.  And that's what I did.  So a couple of things that I learned while going through those, and the reason I want  to come and talk about this now is everybody waits",

    "pageContent": "until the first of the year to set their  goals.  And then the irony is we set the goals on December 25th, September 26, between Christmas  and New Year's.  And then everybody goes out on New Year's Eve, they get completely drunk, smashed, and  they start the year with a hangover, right?  And that's, it's crazy.  And by the weekend, no one's going to the gym, no one's doing anything, no one's making  their calls, no one's doing their due diligence, no one's doing any of this stuff.  So what I want to do before the beginning of the year comes, I want to get my goals  in place right now and start working towards them now.  So I have a jumpstart in everybody else.  But a couple of things that I learned and I encourage you guys to go look at the goals  that you set early 2024 and just review them.  And it hopefully some of you guys had a phenomenal year.  Hopefully some of you guys like really, really crushed it and you stuck to your goals.  And the disappointing part, guys, at least for me with looking at my goals.  And there was a couple that I hit for sure.  And there was a couple. The ones that I hit were not even ones that I was really that  excited about or expecting to hit, but with a change of fate and a twist of destiny,  I guess, I decided to pick up my slack in some of these areas.  But the crazy part is what I started realizing as I was going through my goals is that at  the beginning of the year, 2024, I set my goal and then I created the map.  Just like when you guys join this group, right?  You you create you set your goal.  And then if you watch exhaustive and satisfied, you go through and it shows you  exactly how to create your map to get to the goal.  And you do this for every single one of your goals.  It doesn't matter if it's a fitness goal, doesn't matter if it's a spiritual goal.  It doesn't matter if it's a relationship goal.  It doesn't matter if it's a business goal.  It's the same formula.  You break it down into quarters and then in the months and then in the weeks, then in  the days and then sometimes in the hours.  And you go and you attack it.  And once you set the goal, all you have to do and you set the goal, you set the map,  you set like your exact roadmap to get there.  All you have to go is it all you have to go and do is just do exactly what's on the  map. You just have to follow the map.  If it says that on Tuesday, December or whatever, you need to do five cold calls or  you need to talk to five business owners, that's what you have to do, even if you  don't feel like it. Right.  Just like the example I always use, if you're in, you know, New York and you want to  get to Los Angeles, you got a map and you know exactly how to get there by.  January 4th, you know how many miles you need to you need to travel, you know which  states you need to go through, you know where you can stop, where your breaks for  the bathroom, where your breaks to eat, to sleep, et cetera.  You have this entire map laid out and all you got to do is do the map.  But the problem is we get distracted.  The problem is we get tired.  The problem is we get, you know, oh, let me go do this.  Let me check",

I'm going to do that. That trip that's going to come before hitting my goals.  So to me, I sat there today and I was like, I set all these goals at the beginning of  the year. The year passed.  This is the part that's like really, really kind of a slap in the face, guys, is  that the year passed, right?  Eleven months has passed since we set these goals, almost 12 months.  And there's somebody out there that created a million dollars for themselves, a  new million dollars.  There's somebody out there that became a millionaire this year.  There's somebody out there that probably for sure that became a billionaire.  There's somebody out there that got the body that they have been waiting their  whole lives to get. There's somebody out there that created the relationship that  they've waited their entire lives to create.  And then there's some of us or some of you.  And I would speak for us in general that like we were in the same spot we were  last year. Right.  And it's weird because even if you improve incrementally.  The improvement from last year to this year feels better than staying the same as  last year, even if even if your last year was better than than my last year, for  example. And I remember this because me going from eight to ten thousand dollars  a month, negative sixty thousand dollars in debt to making my first million  dollars. That was the best thing ever.  Right. That was the best thing ever because I increased.  I did. Now, from twenty twenty to twenty twenty one, we made more money on a  gross level, but I spent more money as well.  And I didn't really make much more money in my pocket.  So for twenty twenty to twenty twenty one, I made almost half a million dollars  more. I made one point four or five something million dollars, one point four or  five one. And by the way, this is not the course.  This is just with lead generation.  I made almost a half a million dollars more than I did in twenty twenty.  But I put the almost the exact same amount in my pocket.  And I wasn't near as excited at all about that because I didn't really improve.  But going from twenty nineteen from eight to ten thousand dollars a month, barely  making it to getting to a million dollars was phenomenal.  Right. Because I improved.  So anyway, all this to say, guys, what I encourage you guys to do before it becomes  the first of the year becomes Christmas and we've got like four days, five days and  everyone's, you know, cold and drinking spiked eggnog.  Why don't we spend time right now, early December, spend time this week reviewing  your goals. Look at where you messed up.  Where did you get off track? What was it that happened?  What what derailed you?  What at what point did you decide to take a different route than the route that was  going to get you to the Los Angeles or the Miami, which is your ultimate goal?  Because all you would have had to do, this is me speaking to myself, is follow the  freaking map, Nick, and you could have been to that goal.  You could have done this thing.  Guys, there was things I was so excited about that I completely got derailed.  And I used personal issues in my life.  Oh, but I'm dealing with this.  Oh, but I got this relationship thing. ",

I had some stuff that I had to take care of, some like legal stuff that was  complete, I think, complete BS.  It's completely handled.  It was it was it was basically a competitor that went and found a loophole.  And anyway, long story short, we dealt with that all year and last year.  And at times when I wasn't, you know, making that progress to my towards my goals,  I was using that.  Some of you guys have a sick pair.  Some of you guys are in the middle of a divorce.  Some of you guys have custody issues.  We all have stuff.  And it's just like when you take a road trip, everyone has car issues.  Everyone has the flat tire.  Everyone has this thing.  And you have to just realize those things are going to come.  But you got to stay on track.  And if those things come, you got to make up for it.  So, my friends, one thing that I was just going to throw out there,  one thing that I'm thinking about this year is as I'm writing down my goals  and I'm writing down my goals in four different categories,  we're going to have probably an entire live on goal setting  because I think it's super, super important.  I know it can become mundane and whatever.  But it's very, very important to write it down and to keep reviewing it.  One of the things I started thinking today as I was writing down my goals,  I was looking at last year's goals.  I'm like, how do I want to take any of those and bring them into this year?  Do I want to start completely fresh?  And I started thinking, you know, a couple of years ago,  when we talked about goals, I would talk to people about the the goal  and then the die goal or the junkie goal, the goal.  That's like, hey, if I don't hit this, I'm going to do something crazy.  I'm going to I'm going to put an embarrassing picture of myself on the Internet.  I'm going to give away ten thousand dollars.  I'm going to do something very, very crazy.  I'm going to publicly humiliate myself if it doesn't happen.  And I also call it the junkie goal. Right.  And the analogy with the junkie is that for some reason, the junkie,  the guy on the street, the gal on the street that needs the heroin hit  or whatever in their arm, they always find a way to get the hit.  They always find a way to get the needle in their arm.  They have no money. They have no home. They have no clothes.  They barely are breathing.  Yet somehow, someway, whether it's diving for tin cans  to go collect enough money to get enough to buy the hit, they always find a way.  Maybe it's sometimes it's not great.  Sometimes it's stealing.  Sometimes it's it's doing some very heinous things,  but they always find a way to get the hit.  And it's like we for some reason just treat our stuff so casually.  We need to treat it. We need to become junkies in a way.  And that sounds so weird and it sounds kind of backwards.  But we we should learn from these people, man.  They figure out a way no matter what comes to to to get to their goals.  And so this year, what I want to do, Stephanie, what's going",

I'm setting goals of like I'm willing.  The goals that I'm going to set this year are goals that I'm willing  to post publicly so that people can hold me accountable,  which means I'm going to think about it a couple of times  before I just throw it on my list of like, yeah, I'm going to do this.  I'm going to run the, you know, the Boston Marathon.  I'm going to qualify for the Boston Marathon.  I'm going to run a sub three, three mile, three hour marathon.  Right. Like, I'm going to think about that before I go and throw that up.  And one thing that I'm really considering and I might ask you guys  to do the same or consider the same is like as you're going through your goals,  you're reviewing last year and you're looking at this year.  What if your goals were public?  What if the things that you're you're writing down were there for everybody  to see and everybody could hold you accountable?  How would you change it? I'm not saying to think smaller.  I'm saying what I'm saying to think very seriously about what you write down  this year. OK, because what I know, guys, is this.  It takes one good year.  It takes one. Put your head in the sand.  Put nothing in the sand.  Put your head down, put your blinders on, get to work.  And guys, in one year, your entire life can change.  One year, I watched it in 2019.  My life was the same. It wasn't 18. It was the same in 17.  It was a little bit better in 17 than it was in 16 because I was broke.  But in 16, it was far worse than it was in 15.  My life didn't change for a long time.  And then guess what? In 2020, I figured it out.  I removed the distractions. I got simple.  I got very basic.  I got Mr. Scrappy McScrappy, where I didn't care about how I looked.  I didn't care about being out with the boys.  I didn't care about playing pickleball, playing golf, being at lunches,  watching Netflix. I was there to make money.  I was so sick and tired of being broke and having a credit card credit card  desk sitting on my desk, looking me in the face that I was like, I'm done.  And within eight months, I was at one hundred thousand dollars per month.  And within 12 months, I was I made my first million dollars,  paid off my debt, was looking at my first rental properties,  looking at it. I think I was in a new house at that point.  My entire life changed.  And more than just the money that I made in that year, guys, was my identity changed.  And one thing that I've realized is that once you get to a certain level in business,  a certain level in income, this is not an analogy that I came up with.  I think it was probably Brian Tracy and then it was probably Jim Rohn.  And then it was probably one of these other gurus.  But they talk about this thermostat that we have, this financial thermostat,  where once we hit a certain level, we become comfortable at that level.  And we can't go below it.  And if we do, the heat kicks on. Right.  It can also work against us,",

    "pageContent": "because as we if we have a really good year,  we make a lot of money.  Sometimes negatively, we kick on the AC.  We come back down to where we're comfortable.  But one thing I've learned about about myself and my identity  is that once I made a million dollars, once I became one hundred thousand dollar  per month person, I can never go back.  I will never make less than a million dollars.  I just can't. I just can't.  Like, it's who I am. It's my identity.  I'm not saying that my my entire self worth is tied to it.  But I do not make less than a million dollars.  That is like the that is the the floor.  And I will never go less than a million dollars.  I can't imagine making less than a million dollars.  And I don't say that like one of these weird people  that's trying to act like they're super rich.  I'm not the top of any totem pole.  It's just it's interesting because, guys, if you will just claw your way  to one hundred thousand dollars per month and see what it's like to be at one  hundred thousand, some of you guys are like, that's not very much.  A lot of you guys are like, that's that'd be amazing.  OK, get to one hundred thousand.  See how it feels. Then get to a quarter million.  See what life's like at a quarter million.  You're never going to go below it.  Get to a half a million.  Get to seven hundred and fifty thousand, three quarter million.  Get to a million dollars.  Get to a hundred thousand dollars per month and see what life's like.  You will never want to go back.  OK, it will completely change your identity.  People will start to talk to you differently.  People will start to respect you more.  People will start to take you more seriously.  Doors will be open to you.  People will start reaching out to you to to pick your brain.  Instead of you always reaching out to pick up the people's brain.  By the way, I hate that sentence.  Everything changes.  And what I'm sitting here and trying to speak,  I'm basically just sharing my thoughts out loud because I'm talking to myself  as I'm thinking through this day, is everything can change in a year.  Your entire life can change in a year.  And right now, guys, I feel like I'm in a decent spot.  Financially, I've been in a pretty good spot for a bit,  but I'm not satisfied at all.  In fact, I'm disgusted with the progress that I've made.  If I look at the progress I made from 19 to 20, compared with 23 to 24,  I'm disgusted because it hasn't been much.  It's been incremental.  And yes, it's at a much higher level than it was in 2019 compared to 2020.  But man, I'm just pissing my life away if I'm looking at it.  If I'm being very, very honest, I just made a post about this on Instagram  and Facebook about like this year, I'm going to just level with you guys.  A lot of the decisions I made, I know nothing was crazy,  but like I made a lot of decisions that were very temporary in the moment.  Like I chose, I put this, I chose comfort over calling.  I chose temporary satisfaction.  I chose temporary pleasure over long term satisfaction  in a lot of different areas of my life, in a lot of different moments of my life,  a lot of different months.

And again, I even said this on my post.  I am not, this isn't a woe me, this isn't a downer.  I'm super excited.  I hope you guys can feel my energy.  I spent about an hour and 10 minutes today on version 3.0.  And I'm going to spend another hour and a half, hour to hour and a half tomorrow.  Guys, I'm so pumped about 3.0 and what it's going to look like.  Now, I don't want you guys, when's that going to come out?  It's going to be out before the end of quarter one.  I'm making sure this thing is so dialed in.  Now, a lot of the, and we'll get into more of the details there,  but like, I'm so pumped about what we have or what's coming for you guys.  And I'm so pumped about those of you that just started,  because you guys have something at your fingertips that you can go  and you can escape the rat race with this.  Your entire freaking life.  I'm texting one of my buddies right now, who's just about to become a digital landlord.  And he's kind of been on the fence for a while.  I'm super stoked. I hope he watches this video,  because we've been talking for months.  And he's like, I need to do something. I need to do something.  Guys, you have the tool in front of you.  You have the, literally, you have the thing that can get you to whatever you want to do.  And I used to think everyone should become this, you know,  let's get to a million dollars a month, every single person.  That's not for everybody.  But every single person should escape the rat race.  Every single person should be able to live on, you know,  money that comes in from assets that they've built and ranked and rented from this business.  You've paid to be here.  The business works.  It's working for me. It's working for Jason.  It's working for Porter.  It's working for, I just got a message from Drew Wolber, by the way.  And Drew Wolber just barely hit $50,000 per month.  Okay, $50,000 per month.  I don't even know when he started, but it wasn't that long ago.  It was like 18 months ago.  He's at $50,000 per month.  He's trying to be on, he's trying to be on Ryan Dalton's heels.  Okay, guys, your entire life can change in one year.  So what I'm asking you guys to do is before the end of the year comes,  we're going to do some more goal setting.  We'll do another live on goal setting.  Maybe I'll walk you through how I'm going to do mine.  Maybe I'll walk you through mine live.  I don't know.  But what I'm asking you to do is before we get to Christmas,  and there's that little week after Christmas between New Year's,  when we're trying to rush our goals and we spend 30 minutes on them,  take time right now, review.  Look where you came short.  How did you get short?  Where did you get distracted?  What distracted you?  Was it worth it?  I'm sure it wasn't.  Okay, but look at what you traded this year instead of your",

Because right now, every single one of us could sit here and be like,  I got that one done.  I got that one done.  I got that one done.  I got that one done.  We'd have the biggest smile on our face.  We'd have the most satisfaction ever.  Guys, back to my live on exhausted but satisfied.  That is the thing that you want to chase.  That is the thing that's going to be with you forever,  is those moments when you do hard things that you don't think you can do  and you pull them off and you have the most satisfied freaking feeling in the world.  I'm reading this book right now.  It's about this guy that bought this freaking gold rush town in California.  And he talks about like he's out there working with his hands  and he just bought this entire town for just under a million bucks.  And he's like, I read this line.  I highlighted it last night.  I was reading it as I went to bed.  And he said, I went to bed, my body went to bed exhausted,  but my mind went to bed at peace.  My body went to bed exhausted, but my mind went to bed at peace.  That's how I want to live.  Every single day, I want to be freaking exhausted.  Even if it's mentally, I'm probably not going to be super tired  sitting in my chair every single day building websites, talking on the phone.  I'm not out there working with my hands, but it still is tiring.  And I might be mentally exhausted, but I want to have peace.  When I hit the pillow, I want to know I gave every single thing that I could give  and I move that needle closer.  So I'm basically doing this live for me to go back and look at later  to see where I was at.  But I thought that I'd share it instead of just keeping it within,  instead of just putting it in my journal, which I will do as well.  I wanted you guys to know that today I went through, I reviewed my goals.  I came up big time short, big time short.  Doesn't even make sense.  I came up short, big time.  It wasn't my year.  It wasn't my year at all.  I traded a lot of things I could have achieved and I regret that very, very much.  But you know what?  You can't look at the past.  Whatever.  It's time to move forward.  Instead of waiting until January 1st and just pissing away the rest of here,  I'm ready to start now.  It's December 2nd.  It's cold, baby.  But luckily we work inside so I can wear a cutoff digital landlord's shirt.  But it's cold outside and that doesn't mean I'm not going to be working.  So guys, go and review your goals.  I'm stoked.  We got a live coming tomorrow.  Me and Zach Powell are going live.  We're going to be talking about leverage, how you can leverage yourself  and create a beautiful team that can help you grow.  By the way, you don't need a teaser.  You don't need that many people to create a seven-figure business in this business  and you don't need to pay that much in payroll  because we have things like onlinejobs.ph and all these different tools.  But guys, get on that live.  Zach Powell's making over $50,000 per month.  He's been doing this for a long time as",

    "pageContent": " Let's talk about building your actual asset in what you should use.  Now I don't personally care what you use.  It can be WordPress, it can be Wix, it can be Weebly, it can be any of the above.  It doesn't matter.  It can be Squarespace or whatever new thing they come out with after I recorded this video.  It really doesn't matter, but what I want you to think about for a minute is this.  Let's talk about a custom home builder and let's talk about a spec home behemoth like  DR Horton or one of these national companies.  Now the custom home builder builds a very beautiful pretty home.  They go in, they get these customers and they're like, hey, where do you want the wall and  what do you want on this one and how do you want the bathroom and they're these beautiful  homes.  But there's so much work into it, there's so much effort into it that they can only  build 10 or 15 of these a year.  Whereas a DR Horton, they're like, hey, we've got four homes and you can choose one of the  four homes, you can choose one of the four finishes, you can choose one of these carpets,  one of these paints and they knock them out and they knock them out and they knock them  out and they knock them out and even though the DR Horton home isn't as beautiful as the  custom home, I would love to see the guy that owns DR Horton, I would love to see his house  and his bank account versus Mr. Joe Schmo custom home builder.  So it's the same thing as McDonald's, in fact, fun little fact here, I was reading this book  last night, The Cash Flow Quadrant by old Robert Kiyosaki, my boy and he was talking  about this and he was talking about McDonald's, right?  Could you or can you think of five or ten places that make better hamburgers than McDonald's?  I can and I don't even like hamburgers but can you think of a single place that has a  better system than the McDonald's that can churn out a hamburger that is the same hamburger  here as it is in Ghana, West Africa or here as it is in New York City or here as it is  in Australia?  You can't.  So the game is we're here to make money and we don't need to get emotionally attached  to how these websites look because that's not where the money is, the money is in getting  the phone to ring and getting another client and getting more deals.  So with that said, I just want you to know it doesn't matter what you use, it only matters  that you master what you do and you figure out how to do it quickly and efficiently and  it converts, okay?  So we are going to show you, I'm gonna have Francesca is gonna jump in here in just a  moment.  She's gonna show you what we use and everything that we're gonna teach you in these modules  is what my agency Evergreen does and has done and has used to go from what we were doing  which is almost nothing to seven figures.  So I'm gonna let her jump in and show you how to get that set up.  We personally use Weebly.  Okay, so I'm going to show you how to create a designer Weebly account.  So you are going to search for designers.weebly.com register and you're going to end up on this  page right here and you're going to fill out this information.

So as we talked about in the last lesson, once we get through, we're going to finish  off the shit sandwich, which is we're going to end on a positive note before we go for  the close, right?  So the bun, which is good, the shit, which is the price, which they can view as a negative.  And then the bun, which is good, and then the price.  So remember, shit sandwich should be pretty easy to remember, right?  So what I do right before I ask for the deals, I lay out everything that they get, okay?  So I like to look at all the things and separate them, all the stuff that they get.  So I'm going to go, alright, so let me just tell you, just so we're on the same page,  Mr. Business Owner, this is what's included in the deal, okay?  So first thing is, it's 100% exclusive, okay?  Like I'm not sending these to anybody else.  As long as you're working with me, you're working with me.  Nobody else in this area, okay?  Or concrete, okay?  We also get, you also get the tracking number on the website.  Guys, I know that you're like, no, that's a no-brainer, but guys, if you separate each  of these pieces, think about, I think Alex Hormozi talks about this in his book.  You separate all of these individual pieces.  If they were to do a tracking number with just a regular service like CallRail, I think  it's like 50 bucks to do a basic plan, right?  So it's a $50 a month value.  So I'm adding that.  So I'm going to go back into it.  So we also get the tracking number option, which it's really cool because, not the option,  sorry.  We also get the tracking number on the website, which is super cool because we can forward  this directly to your number, which is what we're going to do.  And it's going to give you a whisper message to you.  You'll know exactly what calls are coming from this website.  Plus it's going to record everything and we have a bunch of other capabilities.  Like if we want to do a round robin or let's say you don't answer because you're on a job,  we can then send it to your secretary or your sales guy.  Like there's a lot of cool stuff with that.  So you also get the tracking number.  It doesn't cost you any additional money.  And then I'll let them know and you get access to our dashboard.  And I'm thinking in my head, CallRail, right?  And you can let them know.  So with the dashboard, you're going to be able to log in and view all the recorded calls.  You're going to be able to see the call flow.  You're going to be able to check out the leads.  You'll have your own login to our platform, which again is CallRail.  Then I will mention, I'll say, Hey, we also, not only are we going to be ranking in the  organic section for the actual website, but we're also, and I'm going to need your help  a little bit with this, but we're also going to be able to get in that map section.  So we're going to build out a map listing that goes hand in hand with this.  You're going to get all the leads that come from that as well.  And there's companies out there, Mr. Business Center, they only do that.  So they'll charge you just to manage",

This is part of the lead gen deal, but just let them know they get the leads from that  as well.  Okay.  So yeah, we're going to do that.  It's called GMB or I guess it's a Google, it's GBP, Google Business Profiles.  And probably when you watch this, it's going to be something else, right?  We're going to optimize that, put pictures and stuff.  We're probably going to need a little bit of help, but all the leads that come from  that you're going to get as well.  Okay.  So we will handle all that.  I am going to need you to help me with an address.  We'll talk about that in a minute.  And then here's the last thing is I'm going to give you first right of refusal on any  deals that we do in the area.  So like with Queen Creek, we're using that example.  So for example, Mr. Business Owner, like if I decide that we want to expand into Mesa,  before I go and just call another business owner that's your competitor, I'm going to  come to you first.  Then I'm going to say, Hey, Brian, do you have any interest in Mesa?  And you're going to have the opportunity to jump on and sign for that deal before anybody  else before I even talked to anybody else.  Okay.  Just so you know, that is teeing them up.  First of all, you're including it as a bonus or as a good advantage that comes with it,  which it is, but also you're teeing them up to say, Hey, this guy's looking to expand.  And when you hit them up and say, Hey, remember how I told you, I give you first right of  refusal?  Yep.  I'm going into Mesa.  Do you want any leads there?  And you automatically have them teed up to get second money, third money, fourth money  on these deals.  Guys, you see how brilliant this is, right?  Completely laid out perfectly.  Okay.  We are going to ask for the deal.  And here's how I do it.  I use what's called an assumption clause and it's actually kind of an assumption slash  option.  And so what an assumption clause is, and I know some of you guys have been in sales and  you're like, Oh my gosh, Nick, this is very basic.  An assumption clause.  It means you're assuming the sale.  You're assuming the deal.  So guys, what I'll do is I'll end, I'll mention all of the good things, right?  And then a high note, and then I'll just be really smooth and say, cool.  So all I got to do and I'll search around for my pen.  Like you could see me naturally.  I'll grab my pen or whatever.  I'll be like, let me grab my pen.  So all I got to do to get you guys, or to get you going is grab a card from you.  Are you an Amex or a Visa?  Okay.  And I'll just look down like I'm writing or I'll look right at the screen or I'll grab  my pen.  Like I'm getting ready to write down the number and I'll wait.  Are you an Amex or a Visa?  Okay, wait.  And I'm telling you right now, if you've done the setup correctly and if you've done all  the steps correctly and you've sent",

I remember the first couple of times this happened to me, I started talking too much.  I was like, cool.  Yeah.  Sounds good.  So man, the other cool thing is this, the other cool thing is it's like, just relax.  Okay.  Just act like you do this every day.  Okay.  And the first time you do this, you're like, holy shit, I just got this deal, baby.  Let's go.  And you want to fist bump, save it till the zoom calls off.  Okay.  Just be calm.  So yeah, no problem.  I'm actually just going to get everything set up while you're doing that.  And you're over there just biting your nails.  They're going to give you the card.  You're going to, and here's what you're going to do.  If you get the deal right here, and in the next video, we're going to talk briefly about  objections.  But if you get the deal right here, which you will more often than not, if you do this  correctly.  Okay.  And like, I'm talking most of the time.  What I would recommend you doing is just writing the information down and that's going  to lead us to two videos from here where I'm going to show you how to set this up in Stripe  or into another merchant account, whatever, but you're just going to write down their  credit card information, their code on the back, their expiration date, their first and  last name and their zip code on a piece of paper.  That's the easiest way to do it because I know some people where they're like, let me  send you an invoice.  I just asked them for the credit card.  I'm going to write the damn thing down on a piece of paper and I'm going to go set  it up.  Okay.  So right there, if you've done it correctly, you're going to get the deal.  And if you guys have skipped a step, you're going to find out and you're, they're going  to go, yeah, Nick, like, yeah, haha, that's smooth, man.  Haha.  I like that.  Right.  Some of them are going to say that they're going to go.  So here's what I'm going to do.  And you're like, oh, here we go.  And they're going to say, so I'm going to give me about a day.  I'm going to talk to my, my spouse or I'm going to talk to my partner and, and I'll  let you know.  And all of a sudden, as they start saying it, you go, oh shoot, I forgot about the partner.  Okay.  And that leads us into the video that we're going to talk about next, which is about objections.",

I mean, that's a good question because, I mean, honestly, on a lot of the niches that  I do, like a lot of the traffic really comes from the GMB itself, you know?

It's a good question, but I would say this, like, this is my thoughts is, if you have  somebody that's doing them and you have your, it's systematized and everything else, like,  I would definitely just start doing them from the get-go.

For us, we have certain things, like we build a website, then we do the, you know, I'm not  speaking in order, but let's say we build a website, then we add the content, then we  do the page title, then we do the H1, then we do the description, then we do the, let's  say we jump to the citations and then we start doing the reviews and then their next step  is we just have a backlink structure.  It's like, but you know, it's just part of the process because we know that it's going  to speed it up and eventually we're going to be able to turn off the ad.  So in my opinion, I guess by saying that, I would say I would just do it.  I would just start doing it because even if you can rank without it, it's still going  to be an insurance policy for you.",

    "pageContent": " Beautiful. Okay. Let's do this. So guys, welcome to I think this is like the seventh call that  we've actually done with this format. Let me get my mic a little bit closer. Again,  we used to do as many people as we could on the Facebook group vanity metrics. Let's get  a whole bunch of people that also last thing, Jason, please make sure everyone's muted.  I think it's default to mute everybody. But if you see that it just distracts on the call.  Just mute everybody. Anyway, this is I think our seventh call. What we're going to do and what I  always do is if you stay on this call till the end and you have your camera on obviously,  then we're going to screenshot everybody that's on this call with around like the last five  minutes and we're going to automatically create and send you guys a digital resource that covers  the things that we talk about in this call. So it's basically going to be the cheat sheet,  the notes that normally you'd have to take or that you should take the highlights. I don't want you  to sit here and take notes on everything because we're going to send that to you if you stay on  the call. What I would rather you do what I want you to do is I want you to just listen and I want  you to the things that come to your mind, the things that the ideas that you have, that's what  I want you to write down because I'm going to send you the information that I'm going to talk about.  I want you to think about and I want you to write down the things that come to your mind. So as I  talk today, you're going to have these ideas that I'm going to spark because of things that I say  and that's what I want you to write down. Also, I am going, because this is a more intimate  like session, I am going to leave time for Q&A. So if you guys do have questions and you don't  want to forget those questions, just start dropping them in the comments and I'm going to  probably Jason read them for me towards the end. Try to stick to competition questions,  but if you have other questions and we have time, I'll also  fill those as well. So that said, guys, let's get into this. Again, anything that I talk about,  and I'll start with this actually, just for the person or the people that don't know, I know some  of you guys have been on a few of these calls, so this might be redundant. That's fine. This is my  eighth year doing this business. I don't know how many niches, probably well over 30 niches  I've tried this in. I don't know how many cities, probably over 100 cities. I've lost millions,  like literally lost millions of dollars. I've gone $60,000 of debt. I've almost quit twice.  And I mean, seriously, like when I almost quit in 2019, I had another sales job completely  lined out, commissions agreed upon, ready to just shut down my agency, ready to get rid of  everyone on my team and just be a sales guy. And I figured it out and I stuck with it.  And then in 2020, we finally figured this out. There were some missing pieces. For those of you  guys that are in other programs, for those of you that are learning rank and rent, the old school  antiquated method where you build a website, you put in all this time and you wait for it to rank,  you guys are doing it the wrong way. And I truly mean that. And I'm telling you that  you're never going to scale doing it how you're doing",

    "pageContent": "it. You will never scale.  And I know that from experience. So I used to call this the most perfectly broken business  model on the internet because it's broken. It's perfect because it checks all the boxes. It's  recurring. You own the asset, it's scalable, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. But it's broken  because you are rolling the dice. Meaning you're building a website, you're hoping that it ranks,  and if it doesn't, you're screwed. If it does, you're hoping that there's leads. If there are  leads, you're hoping there's a business owner that's hungry. If there's a hungry business owner,  you're hoping you can sell them. And all the while you're waiting six to nine months to even  check this out. You don't even know. That's why it's broken and that's why it's unscalable.  But once you start flipping this on its head, once you start actually selling the deal first  and pre-selling the deal, then you start to be able to scale. You're able to go into a market,  spend a couple hundred dollars, see if it's actually a good market, and then confidently  go in using somebody else's money. That's how you scale this thing. And so I think about it the  same way as real estate. If I was going to build a massive portfolio of real estate portfolio,  it would be very, very, very, very difficult for me to do it if I had to pay for all the houses  myself. Imagine I had to go buy all the houses with my own money, do the down payments or  no, not even the down payments, the construction loan, all of it, and then try to scale. On the  flip side, what if I could go and I could use everyone else's money and I could already have  a guaranteed renter? I could go and build this thing as big as I wanted to. And guys, some of  the biggest real estate companies in the world, there's a company in Dubai called EMAR. This is  what they do. Every single person that comes to that city, they stand in the mall, they send out  flyers, they're hitting you up. They are everywhere. And what they do is basically they bring you in,  they give you the presentation, they tell you why they're the best, and they get you to put  money down on a project, on a specific unit, you pay a chunk upfront, and then they put you on a  payment plan, and they basically have you pay for the project. They have little risk and they know  that it's done and sold by the time it's finished. So if some of the biggest, I think it might be  the biggest or one of the biggest in the world, for sure in Dubai, companies, construction companies  in the world is doing this, then why the heck wouldn't we do this? It's the same exact concept.  So for those that are hearing other advice, I want you to think about that person that's giving you  advice, that program, that whatever, maybe it's someone you follow on YouTube. How much money are  they actually making from this model? What you're going to find is most of the time they're not even  in the game A, and if they are, they're not making any money. And a lot of times you're getting this  advice, build, build, build, build more websites. Why? You shouldn't be building more websites unless  it works. And I've said this example before, but going and building 100 or 200 websites  without pre-selling them is like building 100 units. And then you open your eyes one day and  you're",

    "pageContent": "like, oh my gosh, we forgot to put toilets in these things. And I know that's kind of an  extreme example, but it's like, guys, that's what I did. I went into the wrong niche. I went into the  wrong freaking niche. I built like 50 of these things and pulled my head out and went, oh my gosh,  I just built 50 of these in the wrong niche. I got lucky on the first one and it was complete  fluke. And then I built 49 more in the wrong freaking niche because I wasn't pre-selling.  So that said guys, I've been in the game a long time. Anything that I talk about on these calls  is from experience. And if I haven't done it, I'll tell you. And 99% of the time, I won't even cover  it anyway. Okay. So my promise to you guys, my goal to you guys for this call is that by the end  of this training, you're going to have a solid understanding of competition with this business  model. And you're going to be able to see the signs, especially the telltale signs of high  competition, as well as layups, low competition, areas that if you go into, they're going to be  quick wins. They're going to be really high margins, you know, able to rank really quickly,  not have to spend a lot of money on ads. I'm going to, I'm confident you'll be able to understand  and see those areas. Now, is this going to give you a perfect understanding of competition?  Of course not. I'm not going to be able to do that in the next 40 minutes,  but I'm going to be able to give you guys a good 20,000 foot view, enough to have an idea. And then  from there, you can build on that. Okay. And again, just for anyone that wasn't on the last  couple of calls, guys, these calls, my goal with these calls is to give you value, just like with  the, when we give free leads to a business owner, right? When we call a business owner,  we don't just call them up. Hey, let me, you know, you want to buy some leads? No, that's not what  we do. Right. Well, Hey, you want me to rank you on Google? No, that's what everybody does. What do  we do? We call them, Hey, let me give you a couple of free leads. And then we can talk. Let's talk  about business after I've given you some free leads, right? We're being different. I'm doing  that with you guys, because I know that you guys, if you're on this call, with the exception of like  one or two of you, which I can tell are in, uh, I think, yeah, I think Shane is the only one,  obviously Jason, but Shane's in digital landlords. And by the way, Shane, if you have to hop off,  you're going to get all this, all this stuff anyway. So you don't have to stay on since  you're in digital landlords, but, um, everyone else, I know you're interested in this business  model. You're interested in, uh, in, you know, taking the next step and making this a thing,  not just something that's a, that's a hobby. Um, I know what you guys are looking for. You're looking  for the right information. And so what am I going to do? I'm going to give you that right information,  at least a bit of it for free before I ever expect you to work with me, but make no mistake,  this is the same",

    "pageContent": "as free leads. My goal with my free group is to earn your business. That's,  that's it. Obviously like, okay, I think I'm a pretty decent person, but that's, I'm not,  I'm not just doing this out of the goodness of my heart. So that's why I'm doing these calls. Okay.  Um, and so it's, it's kind of like this example that I gave a couple of weeks ago.  My goal is I'm basically the guy that's trying to get you, um, enough information and enough  confidence with this model to get you to the gym, right? If we're talking about the gym,  I'm going to get you there. I'm going to, I'm going to give you enough confidence to go buy  a pair of shoes or get a pair of shoes, get the, get to the gym and, and not feel dumb when you're  in the gym, right? However, in order for you to have the body you want in order for you to lose  the fat you want to build the muscle you want, there's no way I can cover it on these calls.  So that's where we have the program that comes in. Just like you would have to get a trainer,  they would tell you the diet, they would show you that hold your hand. That's the difference,  but I will give you enough information, hopefully enough inspiration to take those first steps,  get excited and get in the, in the metaphorical gym, so to speak. So here's the plan really quick  about what's going to, this call is going to look like we're going to spend the next 20 minutes,  20, probably 20 top, maybe 18 on what I want to cover. Then we're going to open this for Q and A  and I'm probably going to keep it to the comment section, but if we have time,  I could also bring you guys on live. And I think that's a really good time. And basically  guys, you're, you're basically getting me and there's only what 10 of you on,  you're getting me to answer your exact questions. So take advantage of those. And if I can answer  it, I will, if I can, I'll be honest with you. Okay. So here's the plan for today's call. Number  one is we're going to talk about the factors that actually matter with competition. Number two,  we're going to talk about telltale signs of highly competitive areas. Three, we're going to talk about  telltale signs of low hanging fruit, AKA layups. Number four, we're going to be talking about what  it means and what you should think when you see an Angie's List and home advisor. And then also  what to do when you spot, what to do, what to think about when you spot other lead generators.  So with that said, let's get right into the call. What I'm going to do really quick. Let me close  my door because my kids are still sleeping and then we're going to get, that's going to be two  seconds. Okay. So let's go, let's get right into this guys. Again, if you have comments, questions,  drop them right now, but take advantage of this guys. It's crazy because I, the reason I do my  YouTube channel, the reason I share so much is when I first was getting into this business,  it was so interesting to me. It really caught my attention. I was really excited about it.  There was a podcast that this guy did that was talking about this. And I swear to you guys,  I listened to this thing like, I'll say like three times in a month or something like",

    "pageContent": "that.  I just couldn't get this out of my head. I wanted more and more and more information.  And the thing that I kept running into is like, I kept asking myself,  how do I know like that I should listen to this advice? You know, because this sounds good,  but what is that? And the truth is the person that was actually giving the advice  wasn't even in the game anymore. And the most money they'd ever made was like $30,000 in a  single month. And come to find out, I don't think that was very months in a row, maybe even just one  month in a row. And so I never had somebody who had made a million dollars in this business that  I could listen to. Okay. Much less get on a call with 10 or less people and ask questions. So you  guys need to take advantage of these calls because I'm literally going to answer any questions that  you guys have. Okay. So first things first, let's talk about the factors that actually matter  with competition. I'm going to give you the high level. Basically, there's three things.  Number one is you need to look at the age of the domain. Number two, you want to look at the  content. Number three, you want to look at the backlinks. And I'll add a fourth is you want to  look at the cost per click. Okay. Now, how do you discover these things is I'm going to give  you a quick little tip. And I think I've talked about this in the free group. There is an extension  on Chrome called SEO quake. And you guys can literally just go download that on S on, on  Chrome and enable it. And it will show you, there's a bar that will show you. And if we have time,  maybe at the end, I can actually just show you an example, but that's going to actually show you  how many backlinks each website has. It's going to give you a quick link to the who is where you  can see the age of the domain. And then you obviously can kind of eyeball the content, right?  For CPC, you can go use a bunch of different tools. And also with backlinks, guys, the tool,  this SEO quake, it's literally called SEO and then Q U A K E. I have it on all of my computers.  It's free. And by the way, I always use Chrome. You don't have to, I just found that it's very  convenient because the Chrome store anyway, it'll show you how many backlinks. Now, if the area  looks competitive, right? And there's a good content, the domains are old, et cetera. You're  going to want to go a step further and you're going to want to look at the quality of the backlinks,  because it's not about how many backlinks a website has. It's about the quality of the  backlinks. And what I mean by that, and that we can do a whole training on backlinks. But  if I get a backlink from, let's just say a local review website, right? That's decent. And it might  help if I'm building a website in St. George, Utah, because it's a little bit relevant because  of it's St. George, right? However, if I compare that to a backlink that I get from, let's say,  Forbes, right? Forbes.com gives me a backlink. There's no competition. I would much rather  have one backlink from Forbes than a hundred backlinks from all the little review websites  in St. George, because the quality, it matters and the quality is much more important in quantity.  So guys, number one,",

    "pageContent": "age of domain. Number two, content. Number three, backlinks. Number four,  CPC. Also as a rule of thumb, make sure I'm going to put this in the notes. Hold on.  I'm going to put this in the notes, less than $5. And I could show you guys my Google Ads spending  and my average cost over, I don't think I have it on this phone. Maybe I can check out the exact,  it's definitely less than $5. Let me see if I have Google Ads here. I don't have it on this phone.  So if I pulled this up, my average spend is like $3.50 or $3.70 across $1.5 million spend.  If you guys are going into areas, make sure that the cost per click of the main keywords  is less than $5. And if it's not, don't do it. Period. I don't care how good it looks,  do not do it. Just my two cents. Okay. And what do I know? I've only made millions of dollars  doing this. Okay. So that's the factors that actually matter. Okay. And if you have questions,  these are perfect questions to ask here in about 10 minutes when we have questions. Okay.  Number two, what are the telltale signs of a highly competitive area?  Here's, I'm just going to give you, this is the thing, this is kind of the litmus test.  If I see this, I just don't even touch it. Okay. And what it is guys is when you guys are looking  at an area, because what you want to do is if you pick a city, you pick a niche, you have to make  sure that you're going to be able to get in and rank the website. Because if you can't get in and  rank the website, then this business model isn't what this business model is. This is a rank and  rent business model, right? You need to be able to get in, rank the website so that the calls become  free and the margins become fat. And so if I look at an area, let's just say Las Vegas concrete.  So that's an easy example to use. If I look at Las Vegas concrete, there's a lot of, you know,  we know the niche works. We know there's a lot of people searching for concrete because it's a big  population, but I look at it and it's really competitive. And it's going to be in the websites  that are at the top of Google are really good websites. They have old domains. They have  really good content. They have good backlinks. Even though there's a good opportunity. Once I  rank, I have to be honest with myself and go, what are the actual chances of me ranking? How  much work is it actually going to take for me to rank? And is it going to be worth the squeeze?  And that those are the questions that you have to ask yourself, because sometimes as good as it is,  it's not worth it guys. There are businesses that are really good out there. You know,  that's what's a really good business is solar. I have friends. I have a neighbor slash friend.  It also my kids football coach. He makes a lot of money and he does solar, but he got into the  right area at the right time and he's been doing it for 10 years. And so if I look at solar and  I'm like, I'm just going to get into it. It's so competitive right now. Yeah, I could, I could,  but you know how much, you know, how much competition is in that business. It's insane,  right? Roofing also a good",

    "pageContent": "business, but it's a very competitive business, right? So we have  to look at those things. So a telltale sign that it's a very highly competitive area is you always  want to search. You always want to clear your browsing history and you want to search for the  main keywords. And that's a whole nother training in itself is what are the main keywords? How do  you build a keyword list? How do you know what your core keyword list, all these things we cover,  obviously in depth of the training, but we have covered in bits and pieces inside of the Facebook  group that you guys can go search. But once you get your core keyword list, you want to clear  your browsing history because you want it to be a fresh search as if you're somebody who's never  searched before. And you want to search all these terms. So concrete Las Vegas, concrete contractor,  Las Vegas, concrete company, Las Vegas, concrete sidewalk, Las Vegas, concrete walkway or driveway,  Las Vegas, right? Las Vegas, Nevada, all these things we want to just, we want to do multiple.  This is one of the things that they didn't teach me in my first training. I didn't realize that  you should probably search more than one keyword. I was the dummy that was typing towing Huntsville.  And I would, I would literally made my decision based on that. I looked at the term towing  Huntsville. I searched it. It looked decent. I didn't even really know what I was looking at.  And I based my entire decision of going into towing Huntsville on one term. And that's it.  And literally I got so lucky that it actually was low-hanging fruit. I didn't do it. It wasn't  because I was good. It wasn't because I knew what I was doing. I just got lucky, right? But guys,  you have to look at multiple terms because let's say that towing Huntsville or Las Vegas concrete  is very easy to rank for, right? There's not much competition, blah, blah, blah. But let's say  Las Vegas concrete contractors is highly competitive. Las Vegas concrete company is  highly competitive. Concrete sidewalk is highly competitive. Then out of all the terms that I want  to rank for out of seven terms, only one of them looks feasible. I'm not going into that area. So  you have to look at more than one. So here's the deal is once you search, once you number one,  figure out ability keyword list, and you have that keyword list, you're going to search for those  keywords with the area. Okay. At the end of it. So Las Vegas concrete or concrete Las Vegas plus  the other seven terms. And I'm going to have all the tabs pulled up to what I usually do.  Then what I'm going to do is I'm going to pull all those up and I'm going to look,  this is just a quick way. And I don't know why this is the case, but I can almost  always guarantee that when this happens, it's highly competitive. Okay. If you start looking  at all, let's say you open the first tab and you, what I always do is I look at who's actually in  the maps. Okay. Now I don't spend a bunch of time in maps to this day. I have kind of just  set it aside. If I can always try to get the map, the Google, my business, but I don't spend time  obsessing over it because I realized if I can rank organically and I can get my ads running,  I don't need the maps. The maps is a bonus. So for those of you that think you need map,  but you don't. Okay. Promise you, I",

    "pageContent": "built a million dollar company without even  worrying about maps. In fact, most, most of my projects, when I hit the million dollar mark in  2020 did not even have Google GMBs. Okay. You don't need them. You can make a million dollars  without them. That's a fact. Okay. But so, but for whatever reason, there is a strong correlation  between who's ranking in the maps and who's ranking organically. And so what I look at guys  is I go and I open all the tabs and I look at who's the number one in the maps. Okay. Let's say it's  Bob's concrete. Okay. Then I'm going to open up second tab is Bob's concrete in the maps. Yes.  Okay. Is it in the same spot? Okay. Bob's concrete is ranked the first, the first listing in the maps  for the first two terms. And I'm going to look at the third and I'm looking at the fourth and I'm  going to look at all seven or all five. I would say minimum five up to seven keywords. And guys,  I'm going to do that. And I'm going to look at if that Bob's concrete is ranking for the majority  of those terms in the same spot in the maps. Okay. And I'm going to do that. I'm going to see  what the main, like what are the main companies ranking in the maps? Now, again, I just said,  we're not worried too much about math, but for some reason, this is a strong indicator  of a highly competitive area. Once I do that, guys, I'm going to go and I'm going to look at  those same exact terms. I'm going to open those tabs back up and I'm going to look who's ranking  organically. If you're brand new and you don't know what I'm talking about underneath the maps  is the organic section, the actual listings, right? So now I'm going to look who's ranking  on page one and at the top of page one. So I'm going to go, okay, Bob's concrete.  He ranked in the maps, number one for five out of the seven terms. And he's ranking number one  for five of the terms and number two on page one for two of the terms. This guy's basically glued  to the top. I'm going to make a mental note and I'm going to go to the next one. That's Sally's  concrete. And we do the same thing and we go to the next one. Okay. If you guys see the same three  companies showing up over and over and over for the majority of the terms, if you're doing seven  and that's four of them, or if you're doing five and there's three of them and the same three  companies are showing up for the majority of those terms. Okay. Number one and B, if those companies  are also showing up on the organic on page one, especially at the top for the majority of the  keywords, you need to get the heck out of there. I don't care how low the CPC is. I don't care how  bad you want to do it. Do not do it. And for whatever reason, and this is my theory is that  Google wants to give the business to the local guys. We're the ones that spend the freaking money  with Google ads. We're the ones. And when I say local, I'm representing the local guy, right?  Even though I don't own the concrete company, I am representing the local concrete company.  They know that we're the ones that are going to always be there. We have to, we need Google. We're  the ones that are going to spend the money on Google ads, et",

    "pageContent": "cetera. They would like to give  the spots to the local guy. They really would. And I truly like think that, and that's, we're  going to get into some others, some, when we talk about home advisor, I think if they can,  they like to give it to local. So if I see people that are ranking again and again and again in the  maps, they're also ranking organically. It's basically like Google telling us out loud,  Hey, I've chosen my people, man. These are my recommended people. And when people search in  this city, they've proven that they're the guys, they're the gals. And for whatever reason, guys,  if you see those same companies showing up again and again in the maps and also showing up  organically, especially at the top, it's too competitive. Especially if you don't have any  money coming in, especially if you haven't gotten out of your job. Now, if you've gone and you're  at like Jason, Jason, Jason, what did you just hit by the way in your agency? What are you at per month?  Cool story. I, I closed three deals in the last seven days. So that's crazy. I closed two deals  last night. So we're at almost 14,000, three, we're at 13,000 right now, but closer to the  $14,000 range. Sick dude. Once we get off that call, this call, I want you to post that in the  group, in the free group, because it just inspires people. By the way, Jason, when did you start  this business? Like a year ago? Yeah, much less than a year ago. I actually didn't get my  head underwatered, like actually diving straight into this business model until the end of January  of this year. That's dope, dude. For, and, and just real quick, this is one of his calls about, but  did you, were you previously in digital marketing? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I did SEO.  You did SEO and you decided to convert to this? Yeah. So I'm sure a lot of you guys have found  Nick's YouTube channel, right? Everything makes so much sense. So if any of you guys come from  RankinRent or SEO, this business model makes so much sense. And it's all, it's all paid off.  Literally, all I do is I just follow Nick's steps that he's laid out for me. The next thing I know,  I'm on a closing call and a guy's handing over his credit card. It's really that simple.  14K, that's, that's, that's amazing, bro. Good job. I didn't even know that. So congrats on the 14K.  Thanks, man. And I think you could probably be a testament that like,  when I found this as well, guys, when there's a process that works, if you just follow it,  it works. And if it works once, it's going to work again. And I don't know if you noticed  that Jason, but like, when you first follow the process, it's almost like, you almost don't  believe it can be that simple. I'm not saying easy. I'm saying simple. Right. And you follow  it and it works. You're like, no way. Right. And, and he just do it again and again. And then  I promise you, and I'm begging you, Jason, because everyone does this. I think you might  have even gone through this already, but, and then everyone gets too smart and they,  they try too early to innovate. There's nothing wrong with innovation, but if",

Or when I go to that, you know, you do that four more times,  you're at $60,000 a month. You're probably with, with the profit margin, you're probably making  close to, you know, half a million dollars a year in your pocket, you know, but we get too  smart and we're like, oh, I'm going to go learn Facebook ads or whatever. But yeah, just, I mean,  have you seen, and you could completely disagree, but what I've seen is that when you have a process  that works and you follow it, you just follow it exactly to a T because the person that's teaching  you it, as long as they're credible, they're saying the things they're saying for a reason.  Yeah, yeah, for sure. One thing I can say also is even though I have all of your resources in front  of me, sometimes like I was getting on a roll, right? So there was a few steps that I decided,  oh, I, I got this, like, I'm not going to apply this step, you know, this should be a lay down and,  and I lost the deal because I wasn't listening to that one thing Nick was telling me to do,  whatever it is, there were so many things throughout the process that,  you know, to be honest, I feel like I should be at $20,000 per month  because I chose to ignore certain things that you were telling me to do.  So it's, it's not, it requires a lot of hard work, but you have to do  things correctly. You can't just go out there and just ask somebody to hand you their money or  take these free leads and work with me. Like you have to qualify the business owner  that there's a whole thorough process that you have to go through with vetting your business owner  and qualifying them before they even waste your time in the first place.  Yeah. And it's just like, I've used this example. It's like having the perfect recipe for the  perfect chocolate cake, right? It, you know, you can go and try to put the sugar in at a different  time and you're just risk it. You make, you could try to use a different brand of sugar. You could  try to use brown sugar instead of white sugar. You could try to whatever for glow the flower.  But if you just follow the recipe, the perfect cake is going to come out. If you decide not  to follow it, then you're, you don't know. And you're just kind of up in the air. So  anyway, appreciate you, you jumping in on that. This Salim guy, you can just remove him because  he's too late to the call. That's in the waiting. Oh, he, he said that he had a license issue.  So you can let him in, you can let him in. Okay. Okay. Real quick. Telltale signs that we're going  to get into questions that everybody has. So guys, on the other hand, what are the telltale signs  of low hanging fruit? What are the telltale signs of a layup? What are the telltale signs? If I see  this thing, I'm going in no matter what. And that is really, really simple. It's two things. Number  one is it's the opposite of what I just explained, which means if you do your, your research, if you  clear your browsing history, you search your five to seven terms and you see that the",

    "pageContent": "companies in  the maps are completely scattered. It's different companies. It's Bob, then it's Sally, then it's  Frank, then it's Las Vegas concrete. Then it's super concrete and they're all different. And  underneath in the organic, they're all different. And most of them are on page two or on page three.  And it's just a big jumble, mumble, jumble. That's a good sign. That's a, a strong indicator  that it's actually not competitive because it's not consistent. And so basically the way I view  it is Google's trying to figure out who the best person is. And for each term, they're kind of  sending people to different companies. And so whenever I see a scattering or I see that there's  a bunch of different companies showing up in the maps and there's no consistency and there's no one  company that's dominating. I love that. That gets me really excited. That's number one. Number two,  this is when I get really excited is if you guys are searching your terms, you search your seven  terms, okay, your five terms, concrete, concrete contractors, concrete company, et cetera. And you  have at least one company in the, in the maps that's showing up consistently for the top three  across all the terms. And that company does not have a website. Okay. And what I mean by that is  it is possible to get a Google my business or Google business profile and get it ranked  and not even have a website. It is possible. And if you come across this guys and you see it's that,  that one, let's say it's, let's say it's called a Las Vegas, Las Vegas, number one concrete company.  That's the listing and they're showing up for all seven terms, all seven terms they're showing up  for. Okay. In the maps and you look and you go and you're like, wait, where's their website?  And it's, they don't even have a website. It's literally doesn't even have a link for a website.  It's just a listing guys. I can tell you I'm, I'm going into that. I'm going into it. Cause I know  that I'm going to be able to rank that pretty dang quickly. And I'll tell you an example of when I  did this, um, I had this client in, uh, in, in St. George and I can't, I can't even remember,  but it was in a specific niche and I was doing the research in a city called Cedar city,  which is about 45 minutes to an hour north of here. And I just, for fun, I went, I did all the  terms and guys, I think it was not only one, but I think two of the top three didn't have websites  for all the terms. And literally I don't believe in rank and rent. I truly do not believe in rank  and rent because I think it's a waste of time, but I was, I've done this enough that when I saw it,  I also had enough search volume. It also had low CPC and I already had a client because I had that  client in St. George. I knew they'd buy the leads in Cedar city. I just went and I called Francesca  or I text her, I slacked her and I said, Hey, buy the domain for Cedar city, whatever.com  build the website. She's like, are you sure? We usually do the one page. I'm like, no,  just build a website. We built a website, no backlinks, nothing did. We did our rate,  everything else normal, just how we know what we did, you know, sound SEO.",

    "pageContent": "We built it within  three months. That thing was completely glued to the top and it stayed there. Okay. And I, and,  and so I'm telling you guys, if you see the, the same company showing up over and over and over  in the maps for the top three, for the main search terms, and they have no website, that's a really  good sign. You should get excited because it's going to be relatively easy to rank. Okay. Last  two things. What does it mean? We see a home advisor and Angie's list. It means it's, it's,  it's a good thing. Okay. It's a good thing. Don't get scared. Don't think, oh my gosh,  it's home advisor. It's Angie's list. No, the reason why it's good is because guys,  if you see home advisor, that means that especially obviously home advisor is going to be in the,  in the organic underneath the maps. If you see home advisor showing up for every one of the search  terms, what that means is that home advisor is ranking their page over everyone else's website.  What I mean by that is it's homeadvisor.com forward slash Kansas city or forward slash  concrete slash Kansas. I don't know what their, their structure is, but whatever their link  structure is, it's, they're, they're ranking a page over a website. And that, that is defying  logic, which means like, it's always easier to rank a website. If I have a, you know, let's call  it a Las Vegas concrete.com. And I am, I am targeting Las Vegas only, and I'm targeting  concrete only. And I'm going against somebody who is, you know, best concrete contractor.com  forward slash Las Vegas. They're trying to rank their single page against my domain. And I have a,  I have an advantage. And so if I see that home advisor is ranking for all the terms, I don't  run. I love, I actually prefer. So if you guys see home advisor, Angela's showing up at the top of  Google, good sign. Okay. Lastly, guys is what to do, what to do when you spot another lead gen.  I had this completely backwards. I thought that if I saw another lead gen, I got so upset. I was  like, oh my gosh, that's saturated. This business model, guys, this is back in 2016, 17, 18, 19.  I was thinking this. If I saw another lead generator, it completely put me off. And I was  like, gosh dang it. I should have come here earlier. I missed my, my, you know, I missed  my window, all these different things. And then one day, and I've told the story before,  and by the way, it's the last story I'm going to tell them. We're going to get the Q and A.  We have 10 minutes. If you guys have questions, drop them in the comments or yeah. In the comments  section is I'm looking at St. George tree service. Okay. And I look at it and I find another lead  generator and I'm like, gosh freaking dang it. I was late to the game. So I'm like, all right,  I'm going to go. I'm going to figure out who it is. I go, I do the who is, and they didn't buy  the privacy. So I could, I found their name and I'm like, let me just look. And I looked in one of  my Facebook groups because I could tell it was a website. It looked really similar to mine. So I  looked at the Facebook group for that name.",

So I find the Facebook profile  and I'm like, before I give up on this, let me just reach out to this person and see if they're  because what I did before that guys is I called the website to see if it actually had a client,  right? I didn't call. I didn't click on their ads because they weren't running ads.  I clicked on it. I called and nobody answered. And I did that a couple of times. I was like, dude,  no one's buying these leads. They're not even touching this website and it's ranking.  That's when I reached out and I was like, Hey, my name's Nick, blah, blah, blah. I'm in the same  program. Would you be interested in selling your, your website? Like don't no disrespect,  but I'd love to buy it or talk, talk numbers. And basically this person, they basically got offended  and told me, you know, to go eat sand. And I don't know what it was. And maybe I was having  a bad day, whatever, but I just literally out of spite, I was like, you know what? Screw them.  If you're not going to sell me your website and you don't even have a client, I'm going to build  one anyway. And I'm going to go get a client. And keep in mind at the time we were just now starting  to do rent than rank. I was running ads. So I had this like confidence that, Hey, we can do this in  the city. And I guys, I confidently went into St. George and I landed a client. It was just about  a week after COVID started. I sent a couple of leads, met this guy to coffee shop, totally did  everything wrong. He went and talked to his wife, but because I had sent them the leads and I,  that's when I realized the power of sending leads, by the way that he called me, his name was Tony.  He's like, dude, let's do this. I met him at a Maverick, which is a gas station because it was  COVID outside, literally signed a contract over the hood and had these guys for over three years  before they went a different direction over three years. And I made here, I'll tell you right now,  if I can, if I can pull it up real quick. Oh, by the way, this is nice. I made two, I made  just 150, not much, but I made $150 at 205, which I always love because I love making money when  I'm sleeping. It always feels good. Hold on tree service. Let me see if I can find this company  and tell you guys exactly how much I have made from this website that I almost didn't go into  St. George tree service right there. Where are you at, bro? Okay. St. George tree service leads.  It might not let me, it's going to make me sign in. Hold on. Let me do one more thing. It's called,  um, hold on. I would love to tell you guys the exact amount of money I've made. I just  want to tell you guys how freaking much I would have lost out on if companies, where's that?  Okay. It's not going to let me. Anyway, I know it's, it's well over $20,000 point being is I  almost didn't go into it because I saw another lead generator. I went in, not only did I go in,  I got a client. It was over a thousand dollars a month, had them for over three",

I would have made, uh, over $30,000 and I can find the  number for you, but for some reason, like I, it's the mobile is kind of hard to find. So anyway,  guys, um, when you see other lead generators, what the point is treat them as if they're just  another business, right? As if you didn't know what a lead gen site looked like, as if it's just  another Sally's concrete, Mark's concrete, Jack's concrete, look at the age of the domain, look at  the content, look at the backlinks and treat it like any other website. And if it's still is low  competition, then go into it. Who cares? Just because I have a lead generation site and I have  a client doesn't mean you can guys. I just barely did a YouTube video on Bentonville concrete,  like a couple of weeks ago, maybe a week ago. I think it was a couple of weeks ago. And as I'm  doing the video live, I noticed that the number two result is a lead gen site. So somebody took  my advice. They're like, Hey, this guy has a, uh, a project. This guy has a client, but why can't I  go in have be number two and go and get a client too. And I don't know if they have a client,  but they have a website that's ranking and I'm sure they're getting leads. So just because you  see a lead gen site does not mean it's kind of, it's completely competitive. And so that's the  truth. And that's the things you want to cover. So guys, what we covered today, which we're going  to use this outline to create the digital resource that we're going to set up. So those of you that  are on here in the next seven minutes, um, is number one, what are the factors that matter?  Number two, the telltale signs of a highly competitive area. Number three, the telltale  signs of a low hanging fruit slash a layup area, a gimme a lay down. Um, what also, what it means  when you see home advisor and Angie's list, when they're ranking and what, what, what it means when  you spot other lead gens and what you should do. So that said, guys, are there any comments,  any questions? Jason, if you wouldn't mind, can you go ahead and open that up? And if there are,  let's go through those really quick. Yeah. Yeah. We got a few here. Um, let's see.  So Joel asks, did your view of competition change from your earlier years compared to now?  If so, how? Yeah, because my, I didn't know what proper competition looked like. I didn't have  a formula for proper competition. Guys, if you don't know what to look, what, what, um, metrics  to look at, if you don't know what a good area looks like, you, you can't even do this business  model. Like my, the training I first got, it taught me a lot of basics. It taught me so many good  things and I, I, I spent $8,000 on it. I made a lot of money from it because I taught me things  I had to learn. I had to learn how to do content. I had all these different things,  but I'm going to be honest, the due diligence process, the competition, you know, assessment  part, it was terrible. It was absolutely terrible. It didn't teach me this. So yeah,  it's completely changed and I learned it through trial and error.",

Like, and the reason why guys is the higher the CPC,  typically the more competitive it is. And if you're not, and the other thing is if you're  not looking at CPC, you're crazy because let's just say that winter comes and things dry up or  things slow down or your website, heaven forbid gets, gets pushed to page two or page three for,  for some weird Google update. I want to make sure that if I kick on ads tomorrow to supplement,  I'm not going to lose my shorts. So that, I mean, the other before I wasn't even thinking  about CPC. Now it's a, it's a huge metric that I look at. So anyway, keep going.  Yeah, yeah, for sure. Um, so Chris asks, what are your ballparking,  what are you ballparking for CPC, um, for the UK?  Um, I've never done CPC in the UK, but my, what I would tell you is, you know, obviously less  than $5 because that's what you do in the US, but I would, I would say that you could probably  safely do less than you could probably shave a dollar, maybe a dollar 50 off, because I know  that it's not as competitive. Um, but if you want to be ultra safe, then I would do less than $5  in the UK. Just to say,  if he's using the pounds. Oh, what is pounds? Yeah, just convert it. I don't know. I'll tell  you right now. Yeah, just, just convert it, Chris. Five USD, two pounds.  3.85. So anything 3.85 or less, 3.85 pounds or less per click. You're good to go.  Cool. Swing. Yeah, no problem. Thanks man. Good question.  Uh, let's see, uh, Salim, uh, you said you have a tree service site in San Jose. Nick was talking  about St. George, Utah. I think you're talking about San Jose, California. So completely different  areas. We actually don't even recommend going into California, to be honest. Don't do it.  Don't do it again. This is just coming from experience. I'm like that old grandpa. That's  like, you know, that gives you that wisdom. And they're like, yeah, when I was a kid and you think  they're full of crap and tell you like, go and try it. And they're like, Oh, grandpa was right.  Don't do California, man. I feel exhausted. Like I, I don't even have energy to like really talk  about it because we talked about it. I have a YouTube video about it.  There's too much money out there to be wasted time in California.  Yeah, for sure. Uh, Shane Noble says, Nick, do you use SEO Quake for content?  Where do you get CPC metrics or the keyword planner? CPC, I've always used SEMrush.  However, I think if you've been on my last two, cause you're, he's an indigenous landlord.  The last two weeks, I've kind of talked about it is we've been working for the last year on  putting something together. That's going to be our like go-to golden standard thing. I've put  over, we put over $50,000 into this thing and we're testing it right now. Um, so for right now,  until I show you what I'm talking about, you could use SEMrush. Um,",

Uh, Saleem says, do you suggest using EMD or going, uh,  some other relevant names for domain name? Okay. So for those that don't know what he means  about EMD is exact match domain. Um, you know, St. George concrete, St. George plumbing, whatever  Las Vegas concrete or concrete Las Vegas. Um, yeah, I don't, I try to get it in, but you know,  I don't stress a bunch. So like I do, I still try to get it in. So if I, I always look at,  you know, Las Vegas concrete, second option would be concrete Las Vegas. Third option would be,  uh, concrete hyphen Las Vegas. Uh, then it would probably be concrete hyphen  loss hyphen vague. I try to keep it in, but I don't think it ultimately is that big of a factor  that again, guys, if you look, if you find a city that's low hanging fruit and you do the due  diligence and it's not competitive, that isn't that technically Google says that exact match domain  isn't a factor anymore, but I don't agree. I think it does matter a little bit. And so if you're  going into a highly competitive area, all the tiny things matter, but if you're going into an area  that's not competitive, you can get away with a lot. So my, my recommendation is spend the time  to find a low hanging fruit area, find one of those telltale signs, those map listings without  a website. And then guess what? The exact match domain doesn't really matter. Okay. But technically  Google says it doesn't matter. I still try to get it, but I don't, I'm not too fussy about it.  I don't have to have an exact match domain, but I do try to get at least the keyword in, at least  the city without making it look spammy. Yep. Yeah, for sure. Um, and then she noble says,  have you done any YouTube on CPC? Um, I'm going to write this down. I was going to just think  about making a YouTube on exact match. Um, CPC, I don't know if I've done it too much on that,  but I can Shane. That's a good, that's a good suggestion. I can make a video on CPC. In fact,  what I'd like you to do, Shane, send me a DM with Jason or Donnie Drake. He's also, he's got two  names. Um, send us a DM with your exact question related to CPC. I'll make a YouTube video this  week. I'll post it and I'll send it to you, uh, directly to answer your question and also be able  to, um, have it as a good, you know, piece of information for anyone else has a question.  Also Shane, uh, you're, you're part of digital landlords. Um, I feel like Nick goes over that  pretty well in the training. If you need to go through and review the training or ask people  in the paid group, um, you know, people can help you out there too. So, and also by the way,  I'm going to cover this tomorrow on digital. We're actually doing, we're rehauling the whole  training on ads, which is exciting. I'm pretty pumped about that. But, um, so yeah, Shane,  that's what I would do. I'm happy to make a YouTube video about it. Number one, number two,  like you said, I know this,",

    "pageContent": "we've covered it in, in detail, um, in the training and also in the  different threads within the group. Um, but yeah, and you could also ask that question to digital  landlords. And then me and, um, Jason can go answer it there as well.  Yeah. Um, we got, we got one more, I think, uh, Joel, on average, how long has it taken you to  rank aside with ads in a low competition area? Um, have you already screenshot this that people  are on by the way? No, I haven't. You should be done really quick and I'll answer this. We can  hop off to screenshot everyone with their name. And anyone's on this call is going to get a DM  from, uh, Donnie Dre, which is Jason. He's going to DM you the digital resource that we create from  this call. So appreciate you guys being on. Um, this is, I guess my gift to you for just being on  and then you'd have to take a bunch of notes and, uh, we're going to create that today. Um, average  for me, if I do good research is, is four to six months. Um, but there's always anomalies. There's  always times you go in and you surprise yourself and you get something to rank. I've had stuff  rank in a month. I've also had stuff that looked like everything else and it took me nine months.  So you can only control what you can control. But guess what? The beautiful thing is,  is if you're running ads, you're making money the entire freaking time. And so you don't sit  there and obsessing, not sitting there. Oh, where am I ranked? Where am I ranked? Where am I? Right?  Where's the lead? You don't even worry guys. You just go and you make money and you get the next  one, you get the next one, you get the next one. And the thing I love about it, like Jason, for  example, you know, he's making 14 grand a month, but his margins, because he's running ads to keep,  I'm guessing most of those afloat, his margin is the lowest it's ever going to be. Let's say it's  50% right now because he's spent, he's got some that are ranking. He's got a lot of these doing  ads for, let's just say he's making 7,000 net. It's the lowest it's going to be. And what he's  going to realize if he hasn't already is he's going to look at that. He's going to sit down one day  and go, oh my gosh, if I just focus on SEO, if I just focus on getting this rank so I can turn off  ads, I can go from making 7,000 in my pocket to making 12,000 in my pocket. And that's like the  coolest thing because you don't have to call any business owners. You just have to focus on  technical stuff, which is the easy part. And you can make $5,000 more per month in your pocket,  which is what a lot of people get paid per year at their job. So yeah, for sure.  One thing I noticed too is like, I'm just focusing on just getting that next deal,  hooking the next business owner. And the next thing I know a lead comes in organically and I'm  like, Hey, this isn't from the ads. I go take a look and this guy's number two on Google already.  I have three or four guys who are already at the top of Google without adding a single backlink,  to be honest. So just let it do its thing and focus",

So that's the truth. Guys,  thanks for being on the call as always. And guys, hopefully you guys listen to what Jason's saying.  Jason, for those that didn't hear this, it started in January, just like this year.  He's already at 14,000. This works for everybody. If you follow the process,  it works for everybody. And so when he's in there as Donnie Dre, if he's given advice,  he's actually doing this. That's kind of a rule. If somebody's on my team, they have to be doing  the business model. They have to have already closed deals. Because if not, imagine Jason's  on this call and he's just speaking from theory. So anyway, if you guys see his post, know that  he knows what he's doing.

    "pageContent": " Okay, so I'm just going to cover, by the way, welcome to the call once again.  If you are brand new to this group and it's your first call, welcome to Digital Landlords  Live, which we're going to be doing every single bloody week.  Yeah, every week, every Tuesday, 7 a.m.  MST.  I understand it's not the most convenient time.  By the way, if you guys can hear me, please let me know.  I have my mic plugged in and sometimes it does a little funny business.  So anyway, if you're brand new to this group, you're going to see me going live every single  week.  I think over the course of almost three years now, there's only been two times that I haven't  been live and I got stuck in the bush.  And I literally was planning on being back at my hotel.  I was in Africa and I just couldn't do it.  Every other situation, it's either me or I've got somebody live.  And I think in those situations, I still put up a replay or gave you guys something.  So make sure to set your calendars every single Tuesday, 7 a.m.  You will see me going live, OK?  Real quick, the only thing that I want to cover is I guess maybe two things.  Number one is if you didn't catch, was it last week or the week before?  Maybe it was a couple of weeks ago.  But if you did not catch the live I did with Ryan Dalton, you guys need to go check that  out.  Find that really quick.  Guys, if you haven't been messing around, playing around with the tool, the rank and  rent engine tool, this thing is making business so much easier than when I was coming up.  Let me go ahead and find that real quick.  I'm going to lose my train of thought.  Where the heck is that live?  I know it's got to be right here at the top.  Let me just scroll just a tiny bit.  Where the heck is it at?  Search it.  Hold on.  Oh, that's weird.  That's weird because that thing got a lot of views.  Hold on.  Give me a sec.  I want to just share this live in the chat.  OK, I'm going to search it.  Hold on.  One sec.  Tool.  OK, there it is.  Hold on.  Got it.  And boom.  OK.  If you guys have not watched this, check this out.  By the way, Stephanie, what's going on?  That's the only other person I saw that looks new from what I was saying before.  OK.  If you guys didn't watch that, I'll try to even pin that.  That is such a good live.  Just real quick in a nutshell, guys, Ryan Dalton has built this very cool tool that  has basically taken everything that you need to build and scale your rank and rent agency.  And he's put it into a tool.  Go to rankandrentengine.com.  If anyone remembers the exact code, I think it's Ignition24.  All caps.  I'm going to type that.  I think that's what it is.  Ignition24, I think.  And what that's going to allow you guys to do.  It's a beta discount.  So we're in the week, basically the beginning of week three of beta for that software.  Now I've been through it.  I spent time almost every day.  Yesterday, I spent about 30, 35 minutes doing more due diligence.  And man, that's not perfect.  We're going to",

The thing that I love about it is with some of these other tools, the SEMrush, the Mangles,  whatever, we don't have control over it because it's just a tool that somebody else owns.  And with this one, like real time, we can give Ryan feedback and say, hey, what about  this feature?  What about this feature?  What about this feature?  And it's made for rank and rent.  There's other tools that people use for rank and rent, like high level and lead snap and  stuff like that.  Also, they built it for a wider platform in an effort to attract more people, which is  fine.  However, I think they did it wrong because this was built specifically for rank and rent  and rank and rent only.  And so if you are in rank and rent, it makes total sense.  So anyway, guys, no pressure, but I am telling you, you can, in fact, you know what I should  do really quick?  Is there a way I can show you without giving away my secrets?  Hold on.  Let me see if I open this up, if it's going to just show you my entire freaking whatever.  I don't know if I can do that.  I don't know if I can do that.  Let's see.  Yeah, I'll just do it anyway.  Let me just do this really quick.  I'm going to show you guys two seconds and we're going to get going on this call.  One second.  Okay.  Ready?  Okay.  Hopefully you guys can see my screen.  I just want to show you guys really quick.  So go rankandrentengine.com, but it's literally this dope tool.  You've got the task tracker, which is like, guys, I was paying for this software.  Let's see.  What software was I using?  Kind of like this.  This is a software we were using kind of like, what's that?  I can't even remember what it's called.  It's the one where you just move stuff around, not air table, something else.  Anyway, I was paid for a software that basically did this.  You could just drag your tasks like this.  I think it might've been Pipe Drive, but Francesca's put all these in and yeah, you could just  track all your tasks you need to do inside your agency.  So we've been messing around with that a bit.  You've got your due diligence, which is dope.  You can really crank out due diligence.  I used to spend an hour per due diligence to really look at a city and now I can pipe  everything in and I'm able to knock out a due diligence in like less than 12 minutes.  And I think I can get that down to about seven minutes once I really get the hang of this,  which is incredible.  It literally computes the data like that.  Then you have your site portfolio.  You can keep track of all your sites.  You got your prospecting pipeline and there's literally a software called Pipe Drive that  this does the same thing as you've got your client list, all your leads, all your calls.  You can buy your tracking numbers.  You can analyze a site, which is the same thing that SEMrush does.  You get your keyword planner and this is version one.  So I'm getting pretty pumped about this.  Our goal as an agency, and I don't know if you guys saw this post by Francesca.  We did an estimate on Thursday of last week and I say Francesca did it.  We gave them an option of $7,500",

    "pageContent": "or $10,000 per month.  That was their two options.  Now we may not even get the deal at all, but those are the type of deals that get me juiced  up, get me excited.  Those are the ones I'll get involved in.  If it's 10 grand a month, I'll show up to a call, but I'm not even including that.  Our goal is to add, by December 1st, to add an extra $10,000 per month to our agency.  Not to my digital landlords program, whatever.  We're going to keep growing this.  I'm going to keep focusing on this.  We've got a ton of stuff.  We're working on version 3.0.  We're working on new ad stuff, a bunch of stuff.  But just the agency alone, we're going to add an extra $10,000 in the next 45 days.  Mark my words.  And this tool is making it very, very easy.  So anyway, guys, I'm stoked about this.  I've been playing around a lot with this.  And this has taken the Google Sheet, the Airtable, the Pipe Drive, the Google Doc,  the SEMrush, the Mangools, the keyword planner, and you've got one tool that's  focused on rank and rent.  So if you guys haven't already, go play around with this thing.  There's a free version.  But if you use that Ignition 24, then it's 20% off for the first couple of months.  And that's part of the beta.  And we want the feedback and everything else so we can make this as good as possible.  But shout out to Ryan Dalton.  Great job, my friend.  Okay.  That said, guys, let me give a little preface to this call and let's do it.  Let me just get back to my screen.  I lost it.  Hold on.  I lost it.  There it is.  Okay.  Beautiful.  Okay.  Everyone can still hear me.  What else we got here?  We've got Matt Torres.  What's up?  And Mr.  Kurt Dahlstrom.  Guys, it's crazy to me.  I love this, by the way.  We've got people from all over the world in this call right now.  Like I just saw Corey and Nick.  Corey and Nicholas are like five minutes from me or 10 minutes from me, which is  awesome.  And then we've got on the other extreme, we've got Kurt, who's in China.  He's a resident of China right now.  I think that's what you'd say.  Trying to see if I can recognize anyone else that's in a far flung place.  Some of these people are, some of you guys are in different parts of the states,  but we're all here doing the same thing.  This is the community.  Make sure you guys are in this community every single day.  Make connections.  If you haven't already done your intro post, do it and go find some people that  are in your situation.  You guys can connect.  And like I was saying, Corey and Nicholas, you guys should definitely connect up.  Jahill says, quick question.  What would you say the baseline search volume would?  Okay.  That's the question, right?  So Jahill, I think I know what it is because I've been playing around a lot  with this tool.  That's going to be our topic for our live in the next week or two.  I know I've been saying that for a while, but I really want to make dang sure  that when",

    "pageContent": "I say, Hey, it's 50, then it's 50.  But that is one of the beautiful things about having a tool that we can control.  As I can confidently say, when the tool says this, you can be 95% sure there's  going to be enough volume.  And I was talking to Corey Gilbert about this yesterday real quick, and then  we'll get into this call.  And he was asking me about population and I was telling him, Hey, population  does not matter, which is the truth.  It comes down to search volume.  But generally speaking, the bigger the population, the more search volume  there's going to be generally speaking, right?  Not in every case, but in most cases.  Um, but what I would definitely say guys is on your first project, your first five  projects, make sure you're not risking, you know, you want to get into usually a  smaller city, a smaller population means less competition, but not always.  Okay.  So you always want to have like the lowest competition, the lowest population  technically, because that means the lower competition, but you've got to make  sure that you're, you're getting enough search volume.  You don't want to go into a city, um, where, you know, you're running ads,  you're, you're, you're ranking on Google and there's just not enough leads.  Okay.  That's the worst.  And I've done that before and I've done this in too small of cities.  Um, the search volume has been too low, et cetera.  So I would just recommend on your first couple of projects, make sure you guys  are being safe about going into a city that has enough search volume and you're  not even worried that you're going to not have enough.  Okay.  So I know for example, we're running a deal right now where we have a one pager  in a city in, I think Virginia, and we're having a problem getting leads.  I didn't pick the city, Francesca.  Gosh, dang it.  Francesca picked the city.  It was one of those that looked like low hanging fruit, but it was on the  bordering edge of is there going to be enough volume?  And it's looking like there's not.  And so I don't want you guys to make that mistake.  So make sure there's enough volume, uh, on these first deals.  Don't, don't even risk it.  Make sure you're going to have enough search volume.  Okay.  Okay.  That said, and Jahill, I promise you that's not going to be a question that's avoided.  I'm that's why I'm in the tool so much.  Part of the reason I'm checking out the due diligence, I want to know this  thing inside and out backwards and forward.  So if I'm going to endorse something, then I need to know it every part of it.  And I do know that there's a few little holes and tweaks we need to make,  but we want to hear your feedback as well.  So, um, Lynel says, how long do you run ads before it's a volume issue?  I know if like, I I'll know it's a volume issue within the first couple of weeks.  Okay.  And, but you have to keep in mind, you have to think about the time of year.  You have to think about, you know, other circumstances.  We've got the election coming up.  We got fricking, we're in the middle of a recession.  People are uncertain.  I've got my business owner right now.  Um, just so you guys",

I have a business owner that's been with me a long time threatening, not  threatening, but telling me, I don't know, maybe I should just pause till the election.  And we're like, what are you talking about, dude?  What are you freaking talking about?  So there are some weird stuff going on in the world, but we're still pressing for it.  We just made a $10,000 a month offer, right?  So we're still, the companies that are hungry are hungry.  And, uh, that's just the game name of the game.  So hopefully that answers your question.  Um, Daniel Kelly, what does enough volume mean to you?  We're going to cover that.  Um, but for now I would, I don't even want to give you, uh, I would just say,  make sure that your main keyword, if you want to be safe, safe, safe, safe, safe,  make sure your main keyword on, uh, uh, rank and run engine says at least a hundred.  Okay.  That's being very safe.  Okay.  And I don't think it's going to mean to be near that, but if you want me to do  that without having to go in and check the tool very well, which I'm going to,  if it says a hundred and the CPC is something less than $5 on, you know, two,  three, four of the main keywords, then you probably going to be safe.  Okay.  And if you're looking at population, I know population doesn't matter, but it  can be indicative of how competitive it is.  Um, you know, a hundred thousand plus to be very safe is going to be work.  Now I've gotten deals in cities with 30,000.  Um, so I'm going to try to give you guys the bare minimum search volume.  And then you guys can know that anything above that should work, but for, to be  safe for a quick answer, that's what I would say real quick.  Adair says people are still spending money though.  I just talked to, I just talked to a concrete guy and said they want, they  start three to five pools a week.  People are still spending money in the, in the right parts of the country, the  right mindsets, like people are still spending money, dude.  That's the, that's a great point.  I dare.  Um, okay, guys, let's get in the call.  Uh, today I got a treat for you guys.  I'm going to be bringing on Mr.  Zach Powell.  Um, now I want to just preface this and let you guys know that this call, um,  we're going to take an interesting angle with this call.  For those of you that just got in this program, I don't want you to be confused.  I don't want you to be scatterbrained, whatever.  Zach Powell is crushing it.  Okay.  Now Zach Powell came into this program, I think it was two and a half years ago  and he was in a situation where he was in a job making, and he'll confirm this  thing was like five, six grand a month and he needed to get out of the job as  soon as possible so he could focus on, you know, his business and so he was  sitting there looking like, what's the quickest way I can get out of my job?  And he decided to take this skillset and take it a little bit different angle.  So he's still doing the same thing, but instead of selling the leads, he's  actually just selling the service SEO as a service.  Now you",

    "pageContent": "guys might've heard me talk at length about how I don't like to do this.  And that is the truth.  I do not at the time of, of talking at this very moment, think we have an SEO  client, if we do, it's like a, it's like a $500 a month client because  Francesca signed it.  I, I had a bad experience, um, in the long run with SEO because I did it wrong.  Okay.  So I'm going to bring on Zach today.  Zach has been able to figure out how to literally build a business brick by brick.  And I mean that because he's figured out a way to go and get deals where most  people wouldn't even, you know, consider getting deals with these SEO clients.  And he's literally built a business brick by brick and he has built it up to  56,000 or $57,000 per month.  Um, there is a correct way to do this.  And the reason for those of you, like, I want to stand by my, like my belief is  that the true way to scale this thing, the true way to have a business that's  passive that you can build today, get it ranked and not have to spend a ton of  time on it and go and live your life, travel to Dubai, you know, travel to  Africa, coach your kids' soccer team, go be a service missionary, do this, do  that, coach high school football.  That's through Legion.  However, I do understand that if you're in a situation where you're stuck in a  job and you want it, you need to get out of that job so you can focus on this.  Then in, in certain situations, you know, getting a few SEO deals to get those  bills paid is not a bad option, but there's a correct way to do it.  And there's a wrong way to do it.  So I'm going to have Zach come on today.  We're going to be talking about mindset.  We're going to be talking about his strategy.  We're going to be talking about a ton of different stuff, um, that Zach does, but  I just want to say that, so I don't want anyone to get super in the weeds,  confused, whatever.  Guys, SEO is part of lead generation.  We do SEO to get our leads in the long run.  We do the ads, we get the deal.  Then we do the SEO to sustain the deal to then be able to turn off ads.  These go hand in hand, right?  Um, so I just want you guys, again, I don't want to confuse anyone, but Zach has  been doing this in a strategic way.  And you can go, if you do this in a way where you go after people that are  potential lead generation clients, you can get them on an SEO deal and you can  turn around and sell them lead generation.  And the lead generation is going to be the thing that sticks.  And the SEO might be the thing that falls off, but Zach has figured  out some very cool strategies.  He scaled this thing up to $57,000 per month.  Two and a half years ago was making five to seven grand per month.  And I'm going to be bringing him on right now.  So let's welcome Mr.  Zach Powell.  Here he comes.  Look at this handsome devil.  He's joining right now.  Zach Powell.  What's up, bro?  What's up, Nick?  How's it going, man?  Dude, it's going great.  How are you doing?  Doing good.  Thanks for having me on, man.  Yeah,",

Oh, this is the new office is actually a house.  So we bought like an acre, put a sweet house on it.  And this is the new office, man.  It's like, yeah, a house on some land.  Hold on.  So when you say we, was that you and your wife, you and a partner?  Oh yeah.  Sorry.  Me and my wife, we just wanted some land.  So we bought some land and built basically like a new office on the, on the place.  Dude, I love, I love the humility, bro.  So you bought an, you, you built a new house using money that you made  from freaking slinging deals.  Yeah, basically.  That's sick, dude.  When did you guys move?  It was like a month ago.  That's great.  Well, congrats, man.  Is that the, your, your first, like official house house, or have you guys,  is this like second?  Uh, number four.  Oh, you guys are movers.  You guys are, you guys move around.  Okay.  Dope.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's been good.  That's cool, man.  Well, anyway, the reason I said that guys is Zach's usually in his office.  Um, but nothing like a home office, dude, wake up, you know, get the shower  really quick and you're at work in five minutes.  So anyway, congrats on that dude.  And I was just given a little intro.  I don't know if you were listening live, but I was just telling everyone,  you know, for those that are new, um, well, first of all, you,  you're still in Phoenix, right?  Yep.  Yeah.  Queen Creek, just outside Phoenix, bro.  That's a, that's a, that's a, you know, that's the city that we cover in  the training, right?  Oh, that's it.  Yeah.  It's a great city.  Tons of people, tons of business owners.  Yeah.  So Zach, Zach was, Zach started in here when we did version one.  So version 2.0, bro, it's Queen Creek.  So, um, we'll make sure to go ahead and saturate Queen Creek for you.  I'm just kidding, bro.  So let's talk about your story.  I know you've shared it before, but just kind of give everyone the, the two  minute version of how we got here to $57,000 per month, where you were at.  And then, um, yeah, like how you, where you were at, how you got into digital.  And then, um, maybe the short version of how you got to $57,000 per month  through simple SEO deals, dude.  Yeah.  Good question.  So brief overview is my dad actually owns a carpet cleaning company.  Um, and he was just overpaying for all this digital marketing stuff for years.  So I started helping him kind of on the side of my job, like three and a half  years ago, and then, you know, helping him get reviews, do a better side,  just kind of helping him.  But then, um, yeah, I bought into your course and realized like, Whoa, this  can go much bigger than just helping my dad.  Um, and so then I started going hard and started building Legion",

    "pageContent": "sites, doing  SEO deals, just like anything I can get my hands on.  And then I saw a path to quit my job.  And when I saw that path, I was like, Oh shoot, I'm going to do that.  Um, and I actually got laid off with a bunch of people cause it's like public  company I worked for downsized and I had four months of severance and I was like,  this is my four months to just grind and make as much, get as much monthly  recurring revenue as possible, as quickly as possible to quit my job.  Um, so I was just talking to anybody and any deal I could get, I was, I was  getting my dad's friends and then I'm cold calling and it started just being  where like all these SEO deals were just falling in my lap.  And I was like, I have to do this.  I have to stack these $500 a month deals, $300 or whatever that person wants and  just quickly build their site.  Obviously someone in the Philippines built their site and I'm stacking it up.  So that's what I did.  Um, got to like 6,500 monthly recurring revenue and quit my job or I guess got  laid off, got another job, but quit that within a couple of weeks and just started  going, um, and it's just kind of from there, been explosive.  Like once I hired someone in the Philippines to call businesses for me every  day, now I just talk with business owners all the time and bring them over, bring  them over to me because they're unhappy with their situation.  Now I actually got a year ago, I brought on the sales guy, so I don't do the  sales anymore, but we're growing.  We're at like, yeah, 57,000 monthly recurring revenue, just stacking those  easy wins where it's hilarious.  Like sometimes we do live transfers now.  So like the person in the Philippines will call a business owner and then if  they're like unhappy with their website, they'll just live transfer to my sales  guy and sometimes like within 45 minutes, it goes from cold call deal closed.  Now we have a new client because all the work is after they pay, which that's  kind of fun, but yeah, it's just, it's just stacking.  And now, um, systems are built pretty well and it just keeps growing.  So that's exciting.  That's kind of the story in a nutshell.  Yeah, it's been, it's been a ride.  That's been fun.  Yeah.  And obviously there's so many details that you weren't able to cover there,  but that's in a nutshell.  And that's why I called this live like brick by brick, because, you know, I  think sometimes we see people, they grow really rapidly and sometimes they  land a monster client and it completely, like I've heard of people getting  like these franchise deals and then they add like 20, 30,000 revenue, right?  Um, which is great, but the way that Zach's built his business is literally  brick by brick, $500 a month, $700 a month, $300 a month.  So if tomorrow Zach had five people call him and cancel, that's not really  going to do that much to his business.  He's still going to be at the same spot and that's a really comfortable place to  be. It's a really free, mentally free place to be.  So, um, for those that have never heard you before, I want you to kind of just  give an outline of like your process, what you guys are doing.  You don't need to give too many details.  Um, but just",

    "pageContent": "like how you guys are getting these deals, because right now  you're, you're removed from the equation, which is you've done it really well.  And so now you have this team, you have this system where, and I'm not going to  like, I'm going to let you talk about it, but you guys are, are finding certain  people, you're, you're cold calling using a certain, uh, type of person.  And then you have a, like, just kind of explain how you're going about getting  deals from like a high level overview.  Totally.  So it's actually crazy how many companies are unhappy with just their website and  their, their online presence, their SEO.  And so we just target those people.  Like, we'll just get a big list of like electricians or a big list of  plumbers or a big list of everybody who uses a certain marketing company  that we know sucks.  We go to their website and see, Oh, their pricing is $800 a month and they're  terrible and they have 5,000 clients.  We'll grab their client list, call all those guys and just bring them over,  bring them over, bring them over.  Um, so essentially the whole concept or a big piece of the concept is like  having offshore talent that speak perfect English, calling business owners,  finding people who are unhappy.  It's a super short script that we have, but like, they just find the unhappy  clients, unhappy business owners.  They talk with our sales guys and we bring them over.  Um, and it's, it's an easy pitch because they've already been thinking  about switching, like they don't like who they have, like there's so many  pain points and we just find one pain point and then, you know, we just  transfer them over to us.  So when I was in college, like I sold direct TV door to door.  And when I sold direct TV, all my sales were people who had dish network or  AT&T U-verse and switched them to direct TV to save them money and give them  like more channels.  And so that clicked with me in digital marketing.  And I was like, because the issue for almost everybody, like I guess in the  chat, like guys in the chat, just write down like, what is the hardest part  of growth for you?  I'm like curious, like what people struggle with when it comes to growth,  like in the chat, light it up if you want and I'll read, I have it up right  here, but generally it's in a couple buckets for most people.  But yeah, just throw in the chat what, why you struggle with growth.  For me, it was sales.  And I was like, I'm having trouble like actually collecting money.  And that made me really mad because I was just like grinding, grinding,  grinding, but I wasn't collecting money.  And I was like, this freaking sucks.  I don't want to work for nothing.  And so I was like, what is the easiest deal possible?  And I thought back to my direct TV days and I was like, the easiest sale for  me to quit my job and start getting a little bit of money coming in as I'm  starting out was just a transfer.  If I can save someone money and give them a better product, that's  just like an easy switch.  They're already paying 500 bucks a month, 800 bucks a month, 400 bucks a month.  If I can just switch that to me, but give them better service, it's an easy switch.  And so I realized that there's actually thousands of business owners in the  U S paying big marketing companies and",

    "pageContent": "those marketing companies are doing a  terrible job and why don't I just like steal a little bit of their thousands  and thousands of clients, why don't I just take a little piece and just keep  doing that until I quit my job.  So that's what I did.  Um, Spencer saying sales for sure.  I mean, I think most people think that like the hardest part of growth is sales.  So thinking of direct TV, I was like, if I can make easy switches, that's so easy.  Um, and so that's how we set everything up, calling business owners, finding  unhappy ones, and then our pitch is essentially doing them our research.  Like everyone's doing due diligence, you know, that skill set you guys already  have, it's essentially just doing due diligence for that company and their  business and explaining, oh yeah, your website, your online presence isn't  good because of these things.  Um, we can do a much better job than whoever you have now that doesn't care.  Now they have a small business, this, you care about them and they just switch to  you and you're just stacking that monthly current revenue.  So that's what it's been like for me.  And, uh, go tying that into the training.  It's funny.  So, cause some of you guys may know I had a background in door to door  sales as well, and we, we, we learned the same thing, uh, Zach sold TV.  I sold alarm systems, but, uh, it didn't take long before you realized, Hey, if I  knock on a door that doesn't have an alarm system, I have to sell them on the  idea of having home security, adding a bill.  And on top of that, I have to convince them they should use my company.  And then you knock on that door that already has another company, ADT, and all  you have to do is convince them to pay their money to you instead of the other  company.  And instead of having an hour and 15 minute sale, it was like a 20 minute  sale, not emotional, logical.  Oh, that makes sense.  Same price or less.  And I get all this extra stuff, better service.  Yeah, that's, that's a no brainer.  So that's why, when we talk about building the list, we go after people who  are already paying for these services in a similar way.  Zach's doing that exact same thing.  Those are the people that he's targeting.  So here's the misconception that I always had about SEO is I did it and I  did it incorrectly because when I did SEO, I was such, it was such a desperate  spot.  I didn't have severance pay.  I just like, I was on the tail end of a failed business, right?  So you were a little bit smarter.  You had like a little bit of a runway and you were smart about it.  And me, I just like failed the business.  And I was like, I need money today.  So any money I was taking, I had a restaurant client.  I had a, like a band, like a wedding band that played like music at weddings, dude.  I had all kinds of weird clients and I could never sell them Legion A, B, I  didn't, none of them had commonalities.  There was all these just like unknowns.  They were all over the country.  I had just a bunch of weird stuff.  I was trying to get the biggest deals possible.  I was convincing people who weren't doing SEO to do SEO.  And I just had this weird smorgasbord of, of a portfolio of",

    "pageContent": "SEO.  And I also had big, like I had this client that was, this is when I decided SEO is  not my game, which I've changed my mind on it for sure.  Otherwise I wouldn't have brought Zach on here, but I was in, I was in a SeaWorld.  Zach, you've been to SeaWorld with the kids yet, bro?  San Diego?  Yeah.  I haven't been there, but driven past it to the beach.  Yeah, dude.  It's a scam, bro.  It's a, especially if you've been to Disneyland, you go to SeaWorld and you're  like, bro, this is like the, the wish.com version of Disneyland.  Um, it was cool when I was a kid.  It's not anymore.  No.  Uh, anyway, I'm at SeaWorld with the kids and I get this call from my  client and keep in mind, I only got like six, seven clients at the time.  And this client was paying me $4,000 a month.  Okay.  Also, I was going into really hard niches.  I was, it was a foundation repair client.  And dude, I just knew when I saw the call, I'm like, this guy's going to cancel.  And that's going to be literally at the time that was almost half of my revenue.  It was half of my revenue.  Took the call, dude, missed the whale show, go out over and he's  like, yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm done, dude.  It just ruined my vacation.  Right.  I'm like, you know, you're like sitting there cringing when you're  getting the churros now, cause the $5 churros, like it feels a lot more  expensive than it did.  And I was just like, dude, this isn't going to work for me.  But the mistake that I made is I didn't have a criteria.  Similarly to you guys have heard my story.  I tell you guys when you're doing lead generation, go into the boring  niches, go into these niches that are tried and true.  Zach's does, he has a very strict criteria for who he works with.  He's he, he, he, he's got all these different like boxes that have to be  checked and if they're checked, that's his person he's going to go in.  He's going to get the deal.  He already knows everything about who they're working with, where  the pain points are.  And on top of that, he set up a system where he doesn't even have to do it.  So what I want you guys to understand is if you are going to do SEO, there's  a strategic way to do it and I want you guys to remember people that need  SEO only want SEO because they want, generally speaking, want phone calls.  So if you can get somebody on an SEO deal, you could turn around and you  could sell them lead generation if they're the right client.  Now, if you go get a restaurant deal, it's going to be difficult to sell  them lead generation, if not impossible.  If you go get an e-comm company that you're ranking their website for  this specific product, first of all, that's going to be tough, but it's  going to be tough to sell leads.  But if you do what Zach does, he targets home service businesses in certain  niches that are unhappy at a certain price point, dude, he's just like, it's  like a shooting fish in a barrel.  You know what I mean?  Um, and so anyway, I want you guys to understand that. ",

And I know you're not a flashy person.  So they, they probably took a while for them to catch on, but, uh, they were  like, what are you doing?  And Zach started helping.  I think it was like his brother-in-law and his buddy, and then they  started having success.  And so he ended up starting and he put together a training where he  actually has his own thing.  He teaches people how to do this.  So, um, Zach, I do want you to drop that webinar if you would in the chat.  And then I'll pin that.  So for those of you guys that are like, Hey, you want to learn more and, and  see what Zach's up to click on that, watch the webinar.  It's very cut and dry to the point.  Um, I'm actually, uh, I'm actually in that it's I've been through it.  It's really, really solid.  And there's a lot of stuff that you can also use for lead generation, just the  concepts and the systems and everything.  Um, but, uh, so yeah, drop that.  And then we're going to get into Q and a here in a second, but, um, tell everyone  like what your team looks like.  This is what's, I think so impressive dude is like two questions that we're  going to get into Q and a, what does your team look like?  And then what is your day to day look like right now at $57,000 per month?  Awesome question.  So yeah, first I just put the link.  It's actually just Zach Powell.co.  Um, it's just like a, I built in like five minutes.  It looks retarded, but it has two videos.  So the first one just shows like my strike page.  So like, you guys actually know I'm not just like some fake dude.  It shows my strike page.  And I talk about like each of the steps and kind of what I learned.  Um, and then the next one, um, I explained more about like what I teach  and the success of people, like the first beginning students, whatever.  Um, but yeah, check out that link if you want.  Uh, but yeah, so first my team, um, and I'll kind of answer this in phases.  So when I started out, it was just me obviously doing everything.  And then I hired, um, an appointment center or an SDR in the Philippines.  And he just started calling people every day.  And that's what just really got us going because now I could talk  to way more business owners and therefore close way more deals.  So from there, hired a couple more appointment setters, hired, um,  website builders first, just hourly.  Cause it was super cheap, like four or $5 an hour.  And now these people would build my websites in like eight to 10 hours,  brand new website.  And I paid like 40 bucks for it.  It's crazy.  So I added website builders, then added like citation builders,  um, added, um, SEO specialists.  So now the team, we have, uh, 23 people.  There's like,",

Um, and yeah, so that's, that's basically the team.  About 23 of us for all of that.  Is that all out overseas?  It's all overseas except the sales guy, um, is here in the office with me in  Arizona, and then, um, I actually have like, uh, like general manager basically  in the U S as well, that kind of like manages the whole team.  So my day to day, um, I mean, it's kind of lie, dude.  Cause like we were going to do this call last week.  He's like, I'm out for the week.  And I didn't even ask, but I bet I guarantee you were doing something  adventurous like that, right?  Yeah.  I just went on like a surf trip to Nicaragua for a week, which was insane.  Um, I love not biking, but essentially, um,  like all of these systems are now built where I'm not doing any of  like the day to day stuff that's all covered.  My mind is purely focused on like new strategies and growth and like, um,  and helping my team Excel.  So like, I love training my team because these are people that  are making $500 a month, but now they can have like the best training in the world.  You know, I'm, I pay for other mentors, big money to like learn  the best of the best.  And then I bring that to like my group and my employees.  And so that's what I love doing now is like helping individual cause  they're like, if your employees grow as people, they're going  to help your business more.  So I'm training my employees.  I'm training my group, my connections.  Like I'm just helping everyone elevate and distributing that knowledge.  I love doing that.  And then I love like analyzing businesses or like aspects of the  business and improving those things.  So like now we have a head of digital marketing, like a head of our SEO team,  who's like way smarter than me when it comes to SEO.  And, you know, I talk with him once a week and we just like bounce ideas off  each other and then he goes and implements these new strategies to serve  our clients even better on the sales side.  I love thinking about sales.  I'm like, how can we be more effective?  So we used to, our SDRs used to set appointments for our closer, but  now it's just a live transfer.  They have them on the phone and boom, live transfer and the account  executive takes over and it helps our conversion rates.  So just looking at stuff like that and continually improving the business.  It's how I spend my, my day to day.  And it's pretty dang fun.  Like it's fun in the beginning cause it's like life or death and you  just got to keep adding those deals.  And now this day is more like, um, I got to look inward and become a better  leader because that's what I'm doing.  So I'm really focused on like personal growth, helping my team grow training  and implementing new processes.  And the more I can learn, the more I can implement in my company, which  is a pretty fun spot to be.  So, yeah, so you went from like day to day in the business and now you've  been able to extract yourself and most of your time's on the business, right?  Kind of strategic decisions and, you know, visionary, where's the company  going, all that kind",

I kind of like makes you, you know, like when you were doing door to door sales  and then you were like a trainer, whatever.  And then it's like, it's so fun to get back in with the reps and  like, go close the deal.  Right.  And I still, dude, I still like to do that to this day.  Francesca closes most of our deals, um, you know, on the agency side.  And then for the program side is Kyle, but I'll jump on, I was on the  phone with Kyle yesterday and I just love to hear people's stories and  like, like that excitement and that also that like people are taking  that step into the unknown.  So, um, but that's a really cool spot that you're in, dude.  Um, real quick, your entire team, apart from your U S based people, how much  are you, basically you have about 20 people that are overseas, roughly.  What's your monthly nut on the 20 people rough, like just guess.  It's like, um, nine or 10,000 a month for like bananas, bro.  That's literally the sound they're living.  Great.  Like they're, they're crushing it.  They're, they're making double, triple one.  Quadruple, like a normal person in the Philippines.  Cause she's so good.  And she's no one else in her family works.  She provides for her parents, her siblings, like everyone around another  guy provides for like his parents, his family, his sister, like they make so  much money that they're able to provide for all these people cause they generally  live in the same house and they're like the breadwinner for like three  generations, their kids, them, and their siblings and their parents.  It's, it's pretty nuts.  So that's awesome.  So I would guess based on what you're telling me out of this 57 grant, what  would you say your profit margin?  Cause that's so guys that there's upsides and downsides to different,  like, uh, this is a, this is the same business.  It's just a different deliverable, right?  Instead of selling the leads, you're selling the service of getting the website  ranked same, same thing you're doing SEO.  Um, but the, the, the downside to SEO is you don't have quite as much control  because you don't own the asset.  However, the upside is you have your profit margins from day one are ridiculous.  Like you're making, like if Zach was doing the work himself, his profit  margins are literally like 99%.  Um, what's your profit?  Would you say on the 57 K it's like, it's gotta be like 80%, right?  75, 80%.  Yeah, it was that for a bit.  I just hired like a bunch of people.  So it was probably like 50% now 40, 40 to 50%, but it's like, I have  two expensive us hires a sales guy, bringing all the sales, a general  manager taking care of everything.  And then after and the team in the Philippines and Pakistan, after that,  it's like, you know, I'm doing what I love.  And I still make that profit, which is pretty cool.  If I, when I was doing the sales, obviously and doing, didn't have the  U S labor, then it was like around",

    "pageContent": "80, 75, 80%.  Now it's about 45%, I'd say.  Yeah.  But, and the thing is though, in order for you to go to a hundred K,  you need those hires.  So you may, it may look like you're taking a step back, but you're just,  you're just basically building that foundation so you can go higher.  Right.  Yeah.  We're in, we're in growth mode now.  Like, um, so yeah, we're going to hit a hundred thousand next year.  So  yeah, I guarantee you.  So, okay.  One last quick question.  I'm going to get into some Q and a, um, the people that you're working with,  what's your top person doing?  Cause I know when we talked like six months ago, one of them was doing  like 15 K or something like that.  Is it like, how many people do you have at 10 K or what's your top person  doing that you're, that you've taught us to.  Oh, like in my course?  Yeah.  Um, actually, actually 54,000.  So that kind of motivated me to get things going.  I'm like, man, people are now going to surpass me.  Which one of them?  Um, that's James.  Okay.  I got James Lincoln.  Yeah.  That's dope, dude.  Um, Mitch Mitch is like over 20 or 30,000 Vinny's over 20 and he's over 20.  Like there's a lot of guys crushing it, but when James started approaching me,  he's like a good friend of mine.  I'm like, dude, I gotta ramp things up and not just like coast.  I love, I love that.  Well, that's a, that's always, he started like a year and a half ago.  Um, and like part-time with his doing his MBA and having a different job at  the same time, but he's crushing it.  Um, I launched the course a year and a half ago.  So if, and the reason I'm asking him this guy's again, this, this is,  if you want to check out his site, I pinned it at the top.  I love Zach's thing.  Cause it's literally like, like he said, it's like a video or two.  And, um, he just talked to him.  He just shows the proof and then he's like, here's my system.  And if you guys want to check it out, here it is.  But, um, I've talked to some of these guys.  I know like what they're up to is I get, it's got my stamp on it.  And so I guess I would say anybody that's in a situation where like  you need to quit your job, um, today, uh, that's something you  should, you should consider looking into.  And it's something you can do in tandem with what we're doing again.  I don't want you to just go picking up random SEO clients, fricking  restaurant this and, um, you know, whatever, try to be strategic.  Like if you're going to get an SEO client and your long-term goal is to do  lead gen, think about, okay, I want to get into these niches.  I want to be in fencing.  I want to be in duck cleaning.  I want to be in tree service, et cetera.  Go get SEO clients in those niches because you can then go and sell  them lead generation on the backend.  And one thing that Zach hasn't even really tapped into in",

It's mainly just been the SEO, right?  Mainly the SEO, but it's hilarious how easy it would be.  I just need to set up the systems because people ask me all the time,  like, Hey, uh, yeah, we want to get more leads.  Like, can you help us set up Google ads?  And I'm like, ding, ding, ding.  There's a lead gen client, you know?  Um, but yeah, I just need to implement those, those systems.  We've been working on like a lot of automations and stuff, which is good too.  But yeah, essentially like when you're, if you guys are focusing on.  Like, let's say artificial turf or concrete or bathroom remodels  or whatever your niche is, like.  You can do, this is a, this is a pro tip right here.  There's this thing called outscraper.  Um, and you can, it can pull like thousands of businesses  from Google business profiles.  So use outscraper, grab a list of 5,000, um, concrete companies and have an  SDR call them, and now you're getting a conversation started and you're  building trust with your core market.  And then the easiest way in the door is to just do a better website for them.  They already have a website there to pay for it.  Um, and you can just make it way better.  And now they trust you and now your foot's in the door.  You're already making money from them day one.  Now you can quit your job.  And in your mind, you're like, dude, I already have this connection.  I've already pre-sold it, right?  Like Nick's all about the art of pre-selling.  You basically have a pre-sale because you have this client in your pocket.  They're a concrete company.  They trust you.  They're already paying you.  You know, you have the insights to like how much work they can handle, how  they're growing, like how many jobs they can handle each month.  And you just crush it for them.  And then you're like, Hey, do you want more jobs?  A lot of business owners do Google ads, do whatever.  I actually have leads that are only for you ready to go 10 a month.  And I'll sell them to you for this much.  I'm going to, I was going to sell them to another guy, but I'm glad that  I actually know you because now I can sell them to you.  Do you want them?  You have first right of refusal on these leads.  Of course you're going to take those jobs, right?  It's like the easiest sale up.  So yeah, check out outscraper, check out that system, check out the videos on my,  on my page, I think you guys will get some good thoughts going.  So the other thing, other reason I wanted to have Zach is even if you guys don't  take anything else from this call, because you choose not to, because you  should be taking some nuggets is like, you guys need to realize that there's  like, once you get into a business, cause you guys are in digital landlords.  I've got, I've shown you guys exactly the system that I've used, exactly how I  was able to get to a hundred thousand dollars per month, but as you get going,  you start to see opportunities that you had no idea were",

    "pageContent": "there.  So like, I'm pretty sure when Zach started, um, he, you know, got done with  college or whatever, did you graduate college?  You, you got a degree, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  I studied business at BYU.  Okay.  So yeah, I, I'm guessing you probably didn't imagine yourself like managing  websites for small businesses, like whatever you probably just, it was not  even on your radar, but then you get going, you start doing, and then you  see an opportunity and boom, now you're making $57,000 a month, managing  SEO for small businesses and you have a team of 20 plus people and you're  making, you know, a lot of money, you live in the life you want to live.  And it's just, it's exciting.  So, um, guys, people like,  one last thought that I'll share is, um, it's actually crazy how many clients  we have that don't really care that much about SEO.  They like went with us because they just wanted a better looking website.  And those clients, I saw someone in the chat asked like about our retention.  Um, I've been doing this for like about two and a half years, like focusing on  this and we have clients that we've had for over a year, over two years because  they just like us, they like the look of their site.  They get most of their business from word of mouth anyway, but they  just want to be online.  And so like the SEO is like low priority for them.  So yeah, we're doing it and we're, we're doing the SEO, but they  don't actually care about it.  They are basically in their minds, they're just paying 500 bucks a month.  So they have a good looking website and someone that they can email to  make updates whenever they want.  Um, and yeah, like SEO is being done and they have like our expertise.  They can email and say, Hey, what should we do here?  We give them like their Google review links so they can text it out.  Like we do some things for them, but so many of these people are just like,  Oh, I'm just paying 500 bucks a month for my website, 300 bucks, bucks  a month for my website.  That's not something you cancel.  You want to have a website online.  And so it's, it's actually crazy.  Like I could tell, I could fire my whole SEO team.  We could stop making sales and there would still be probably about 10 to  20,000 monthly recurring revenue that would just sit there for years and years  and years because we have their website lives and that's all they care about.  It's pretty crazy.  So there's some people that really care and that, um, you know, we do  obviously do a great job for them, but we even do a great job for people  that don't care, but I just like talking with them.  I just know they're not going to turn cause they just like how their website  looks and they're going to pay us 500 bucks a month because like we're their  online guys and we're their only connection to like the online world.  And it's really weird, man.  Like you get those, you get those deals and you kind of know them.  And I'm like, this is the easiest craziest thing in the world, but they love  it because they feel confident in us taking care of it all really well.  So  these are like people that have just decided that they're just going to have  that monthly fee forever and they, they, maybe",

    "pageContent": "they haven't even consciously  decided, but yeah, to them, that's just how it is.  That's just the fee.  And that's one of the things Zach does really well is he's strategic about the  people that he targets and he's targeting people that are already comfortable with  this bill and, uh, that's what makes the retention.  So again, there's so many, there's so many commonalities with what I talk  about with what Zach's saying is when I always say, Hey, that, you know, the  money's made or lost in picking the right city in the right niche and picking  the business owner, you guys pick the right business owner in the right  city and niche, your retention is going to be so much lower.  You pick a high maintenance business owner.  I don't care how many leads you're piping them full of.  It's going to be difficult.  So it all comes down to how you do that.  And Zach has a really good system for how he selects those people and how  he goes after them, what he says.  And it's from the second you make that initial call until you close the deal.  But, um, anyway, Zach Powell, thanks for jumping on this call, dude.  Really appreciate it.  57 K per month from, uh, from what were you making before?  Around five to seven gross, um, 70,000 a year.  So like $4,500 a month.  Yeah.  Amazing.  Quite a bit different now.  It's crazy.  That's wild.  And, uh, here we are a couple of years later and I've, I've, I've seen  this firsthand in my life and I always say this is like, you're closer than  you think to getting to your, to the goals that you have in the life that  you, that you want.  And it's like, I think it's in this book at the beginning.  It talks about the three feet of being three feet from gold.  Um, I know for me, what eight months before I hit a hundred thousand dollars  a month, I was, I was $60,000 in debt.  I had no idea.  I was almost ready to give up on, on being a business owner.  And, uh, and I know for you, your, your growth was much more like stable and  consistent, but nonetheless, two and a half years ago, you were just paying the  bills and now you're building a new house, going to Nicaragua on a random  October week to, to go surfing, dude.  That's amazing.  I love that, bro.  The waves were good.  So how'd you go?  Well, guys check out that link.  Zach.  It's Zach.  Is it Zachary Powell or Zach Powell doc CEO?  You see what it is?  Yeah.  Zach Powell.  .co.  Powell with two L's.co go and check it out.  If you guys are interested, hit them up and, uh, go from there.  But Zach Powell, thanks bro.  Yeah.  Thanks Nick.  Appreciate it, man.  Okay.  We'll talk soon.  Thanks everyone.",

    "pageContent": " Alright guys, it's time to close the deal and before we get into the script and we get  into all of that, I want to share something, I want to give an analogy and this is the  way I want you guys to think about the clothes, okay?  And there's a reason why this module is actually fairly short, you're going to find it's relatively  digestible and that is because to stress once again, the clothes happens in the setup.  The way you do the setup, the better you do the setup, the easier the clothes and so that's  why I want to show you guys that this part right here should be easy.  This part should be you guiding them through the process, collecting the card and going  on to the next deal.  This should not be a huge thing, okay, if you've done it correctly.  But I want you guys to think about baking a cake and so I haven't baked a lot of cake  in my days and I really haven't baked that much at all, but I want you just to think  about it because you can imagine, right?  With a cake you have a recipe and the closer that you follow that recipe, the better the  cake is going to turn out as long as the recipe is good, right?  So I want you to think about the recipe being the process and the cake being a sale.  So here's what's cool about this specific process is you have probably noticed as I've  interviewed people and as people have come through this program, you've probably seen  that most of them when I do the interviews, they say just flat out, yeah, I messed up  70% of what I was supposed to do.  I messed up 20%.  I didn't do anything right and I still closed the deal.  So the beautiful thing about this specific process, our process here in Flat View Mastery  is you don't need to do it perfectly.  You actually don't need to do it perfectly.  All your goal is is you want to follow this recipe, which is the process.  You want to follow it as closely as you possibly can and the closer you can follow the recipe,  the closer you can follow the process, the more consistent your results are going to  be.  But what's interesting and what's crazy and what's pretty cool is that even if you don't  follow it exactly, you will still more often than not finish the process, finish the recipe  and you'll still have a cake.  And that's what's so cool about this whole process is we've seen people who do everything  wrong, right?  They don't get both business owners on the phone and they still close the deal or they  don't do the live transfer process correctly or they don't cover certain objections exactly  how they should have.  They don't do the zoom call at the right time, all these different things and they still  close the deal.  So I just want you to picture this, this entire process, but specifically this step.  We're trying to follow this exactly as it's laid out because I've done it enough times  where I know what the recipe is.  I know that if you do these certain things, you are going to get a deal.  So the closer you can get to following everything that I'm about to share and everything that  we've shared, we've shared up to this point, the more likely you are going to have the  same result every time, which is a nice, fat, juicy deal.  Do the best you can.  Don't sweat it.  Just send it every single time and you will get deals.",

I would, but I wouldn't do 60 miles.  I might do like 30 because they say that. But then guess what? As soon as the leads start freaking  coming in, they're going to want to stay close to home. So yeah, I don't think there's anything  wrong with bumping it out. But before you do that, Charlie, I would go and make sure,  is the CPC under five bucks? Is the due diligence correct? Are you in the niches that I'm talking  about? Are you in the cities that I'm trying to show you how to get into? Do you have the ad set  up exactly? Are you running a smart campaign? Are you doing exactly as I trained before you go in  and expand it? That's the only thing that I would say before you do it. But yeah, I don't see  anything. That's a very minor thing. Maybe I start with, you know, from 15 to 20, then to 25 and to  30, but don't go to 60. I'm just telling you from experience, you're going to go to 60, you're going  to get more leads.

For those of you that are like,  well, what happens if Google does this?  Guys, I don't care.  Guys, the strategy is sending leads up front.  The strategy is providing results in advance.  The technique we're using right now is Google Ads.  If that shifts, if that gets more expensive,  that whatever, great, we'll go find something else.  If you have a site that does not have,  that already has leads coming in consistently,  you can skip the ads part, right?  Because the ads is, it's the leads that we're trying to get.  So if you don't have the leads,  you need to do the ads to get the leads, to get the deal.  But if you already had the leads, you don't need the ads.  So technically, you could go to Facebook Marketplace  and pay a VA to go scrape Facebook Marketplace  and get a bunch of leads,  and you could use those to close the deals, right?  Technically, that'd be a technique, right?  Strategies results in advance.  So just quick side note B is, yeah, I agree.  It's stupid, Google, whatever.  I'm always testing stuff because, like, but I don't care.  If Google shifts and it doesn't work as well,  then we'll change.  I'm testing stuff right now  because I would like to find something  that works better, that's cheaper.  And I'm hoping there's something out there  and I'll keep testing.  And as soon as, as you guys know,  as soon as I figure it out, I'll give it to you, okay?",

I'll give you a nice little view, I'm weighing out some trucks right now so I am, oh geez  I can't even.  What does that mean for everyone, for 99% of people I have no idea what that means.  So I'm weighing these trucks into this scale house, this is my guy, I gotta hop out, weigh  him in and then I gotta weigh him out.  This guy, you know what's funny dude, this guy drove clear to Mesquite and he forgot  to get a weigh ticket and then he had to drive back.  Okay you let that guy wait five minutes then, let's do a quick intro then I'll take care.  We got Mr. Moin Gollum, what's up bro, Laura Shepard, you got a few people on, guys in  this video, this little live that me and Porter are gonna do, Porter can you just be on for  like five minutes?  Yeah here we go.  Okay, in this video what I wanna do is I actually just wanna go over, like just, first of all  I wanna explain to you how much money you can actually make from renting a simple website.  And if you don't know what I'm talking about with renting a simple website, I'm gonna  explain that here in a second.  And I'm not just gonna tell you, I'm gonna show you my Stripe account, I'm gonna show  you some screenshots of some of my clients and like I'm actually gonna show you a list  of like part of my clients.  The reason being is because a lot of people that have seen these videos that Porter and  I have done in the past, I think you see these videos and it's like, yeah it sounds  like it's awesome but it kind of feels too good to be true.  Would you say that that's, did you feel like that when you found out like I was doing this  or what was your thoughts?  Because I know that if I was from the outside looking in and somebody's like, yeah you can  travel the world and do all this stuff and pay your bills renting out simple websites,  I would probably be like, eh, I'm not sure I believe that.  It seems like it's just like you want to believe that but at the same time you're like, can  I do that?  Like it doesn't seem like you're qualified enough to be able to make that kind of money.

I actually want to show you guys some screenshots of some clients that I have and that I've  been working with for years.  So anyway, I guess you probably didn't have that thought because you would assume I wouldn't  lie to you.  Yeah.  I mean, I had a lot more.  I had a lot more faith.  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, anyway, so let's just do this really quick, dude.  I want to just tell my story quickly, just catch people up, just literally 15 seconds.  You the same.  We'll tell people the model and then I'll let you hop off.  So I do see Jerry, let's see, we've got Laura Shepard on there, Richard Martez, what's up?  Jerry Ward.  Good to see you, bro.  We need to catch up by the way.  We need to catch up when I was out of the country.  Jimmy Carlson.  Okay.  So in a nutshell, guys, I used to do door to door sales.  That was like the only job, the only real job I had.  It wasn't even on payroll.  It was knocking door to door.  I realized that if I wanted to make real money, and again, that real money is defined by different  people, but money where I would say seven figures plus, I needed to do something where  I actually owned the thing.  I couldn't be a salesperson.  I couldn't be an employee.  And so I'm like, I knew I needed to start a business.  Didn't know what to do.  Didn't know what to do.  Didn't know what to do.  I was asking everybody.  I was taking people to lunch.  All that.  Just being that annoying guy.  Like, hey, what should I do?  What should I do?  I don't know.  And I was making decent money doing door to door sales.  So I came across this business model.  Somebody introduced me to this specific podcast and said, hey, you should check this out.  Looked it up and it was talking about this idea where what you do is you pick a city,  you pick a niche.  So for example, Para One Tree Service, you build a simple website and then you rank that  website on Google.  And from once it ranks, you're going to start getting phone calls.  You take those phone calls and you sell the phone calls.  So you're essentially a middleman.  You are you're like a lead broker, right?  So this is the model.  It made perfect sense to me because they explained like once you do this, it's it's passive.  You have these websites that are out on the Internet collecting phone calls and you're  selling the leads and you're not even involved.  It's passive business model.  So I was completely hooked.  Long story short, I got into this in 2016, been doing this nine years, made all the mistakes  in the book.  I've I've almost I almost quit doing it twice.  Got distracted, tried to start a software company that didn't work.  And then finally in 2020, I was like, you know what, Nick, you got to figure this out.  Like you got to start actually making some some good money from this.  This is the right model.  You just got to put your head down.  And we made some adjustments and we made some tweaks.  We figured out a few things that I didn't know how to do.  And everything changed.  And since 2020, been",

    "pageContent": "making seven figures, one hundred thousand plus per month since  2020. OK, Porter, tell everyone really quick how you how you got into it.  And then we'll get into just showing some examples and letting people see that this  is actually real. Perfect.  So two years ago, when I got back from Colorado, I reached out to Nick.  I just got married.  And it was just kind of that point in my life where I was like, dude, I got to start  making some more money, like rent's expensive, food's expensive.  I mean, just everything in general.  I just didn't realize what it took to, you know, live out on your own.  And so that's kind of when I actually drew an interest in what you did.  I was like, dude, what are you doing?  I remember we had a conversation and you told it to me.  And I was like, it almost like it didn't make sense because I was like, what?  Like, that's all you did. And it kind of just was like this joke.  I was like, are you serious? This is crazy.  And then anyways, started doing it myself.  And for a little bit, it was hard.  It was just like my confidence, getting my confidence there of like, can I actually  do this? I have zero sales experience.  I have zero tech skills.  Like, why should I be able to sell this?  And you had been through summer sales, doing all these things.  So like I knew I could do it and I knew that you were like capable of like,  obviously this was real.  But, you know, until I fully bought into it, that was kind of when I saw the results  and it just changed my life.  And just to just give an idea.  So Porter, what's your what are you making per month doing this right now?  Ten six right now, ten thousand six hundred.  Ten thousand six hundred bucks.  OK, so that's what Porter makes per month.  By the way, this is not Porter's full time thing.  As you can see, Porter is taking five minutes to jump on this call, but he's full  time taking over the family farm, doing that.  He likes to work with his hands.  This is just a side thing for him.  He does it during the winters and then he kind of maintains it during the summers  when he's working on the family farm.  So you don't have to do this full time.  I personally started doing this while I was doing door to door sales.  I've been doing this full time, though, for, you know, five, six, seven years.  But you don't have to do this full time.  OK, so what I'm going to do is this.  Porter's making ten thousand six hundred bucks.  Again, I wanted him to be out here to tell you that just because it sounds like  when you think about the idea of building a simple website, it sound  and then renting it out, it sounds like you're full of crap.  That's that's the reality.  And I understand that.  So I'm going to be showing you a couple of examples on this call.  I'm going to show you some screenshots.  I know Porter's got to go here in a second.  But just so you guys understand how this works is once you rank one of these websites.  So let me just show one site, Porter, that you can bounce.  OK, no, you're good.  OK, let me show you guys this real quick.  I'm going to share my screen.  Hang on one second.  I'm going to go to a",

Yep, I can see it.  So here's how simple the model is.  Somebody goes to Google, they're in St.  George, Utah. They're looking for concrete, right?  They want a new patio.  They want a basketball court.  They want to extend their pool deck, whatever.  They want to put in a sidewalk.  They're going to go and they're probably going to go and type in concrete St.  George. Pretty simple.  St. George, concrete, concrete, St.  George, concrete company.  And what's going to happen is when you type this in, you're going to see these.  These at the top are sponsored ads.  OK, but if you go down here just a little bit, you're going to see these three  listings here and then you're going to see underneath, you're going to have some  more listings. OK, so if you see, I'm going to show you guys where I'm actually  ranking and how much money I'm making from this, and it's going to surprise you.  So if you can see this, this isn't my website.  This isn't my website. This is actually my website.  I'm ranked number three.  I'm not even ranked number one.  I'm also not ranked in the top three here.  If you change this, sometimes it will change it.  If you type in concrete St.  George or St.  George, concrete, sometimes if you switch it around.  So now I'm number two.  So it kind of depends.  But I want you to understand, I'm not the first listing.  OK, if you click on this site, somebody's in St.  George are looking for concrete.  They're going to come to this little website.  Nothing pretty, nothing fancy.  And if they call this phone number right here, I get paid.  OK, this is tracked.  It goes directly to the business owner.  The phone rings. I get paid.  If they fill this thing out right here.  Hey, I want to get an estimate, blah, blah, blah.  I get paid.  And that's it. That's it.  That's the whole model.  Build a site, rank it on Google for things that people search.  When people call the phone number, you get paid.  Is there anything else I could explain  that makes that even more simple?  No, it's literally digital real estate.  If you had an actual tenant in a rental house,  that's the easiest way for me to explain it is like it's  someone's renting the site from you every single month.  So before Porter goes, let me show you guys.  I just pulled this up on my this is my Stripe account.  Literally pulled this up today.  You can see right here, February.  What is the date today?  Nineteenth.  Yeah, this is literally I do that.  I screenshot this right before I jumped on.  OK, so this one website that I just really showed you guys,  you can see right here, I have made from this one singular  client, I have made sixty four thousand one hundred and  twenty five dollars.  OK, I signed the client in November of twenty twenty one.  Looks like we might have either had a pause  or they missed a few payments right here.  You could see my graph over here, my monthly revenue with them.  They pay me one thousand six hundred and thirty dollars  and",

And you could see every single week I get paid three hundred  and seventy five bucks.  Boom, boom, boom.  OK, let me see if I can go back to the site.  Here's the site.  So this little guy right here, St.  George Concrete CEO dot com, in all of its glory, is ripping  down one thousand six hundred and thirty dollars and fifty  eight cents per month.  Three hundred seventy five dollars a week.  I don't know about you, but that could almost cover a house  payment, depending on which part of the country.  And maybe not anymore.  Maybe that's like half a house payment now.  But you get two sites, you get your house paid for your  mortgage paid for.  So this is what we do.  So this is one of my sites I have.  So I'll show one more screenshot, then I'll show a  couple more examples.  But Porter, let me just show you this, dude, or I guess  everybody in here.  Here's a well, actually, I'll let you go, dude.  Do you have anything you want to add?  I know you got to go and do your real job, but it's good to  see that you can like Porter does this.  He has leads coming in.  He's trying to get his clothes and deals working with new  business owners while he's working on the farm.  And he's been able to scale this to ten thousand six  hundred dollars per month in addition to what he's doing on  the farm, which I think is amazing.  Anything you want to add?  No pressure.  But if you do.  No, I would just say anyone can do this.  I used to think that I had to be sitting at a desk and I had  all this free time to be able to make this work.  But seriously, you can do this anywhere.  Like you don't need to be sitting at a desk.  Like I feel like I almost get more done.  Like I'm just doing my everyday life and I'm continually  sitting over leads, hooking business owners, getting on the  phone and stuff like that.  So anyone could do this and you don't need sales experience.  That's like the biggest thing.  I think a lot of people are like, I'm afraid to get on the  phone. I've never done summer sales.  Like I'm fresh out of high school, whatever it is.  And it's like, dude, you don't just be yourself.  There are certain people that you're going to be able to  connect with that maybe I'm not going to be able to connect  with. So anyways.  Yeah. And just so everybody knows, when I first started  doing this, I had zero experience with the computer.  I didn't know how to build a website.  I didn't know what SEO meant, which means search engine  optimization. I didn't know what a domain was.  I knew how to work on the farm and knock doors.  That's it. That's all I knew how to do.  I didn't know how to do sales.  Well, actually, that's not true.  I had done door-to-door sales.  When I started doing door-to-door sales, I didn't know  how to do sales.  I knew how to do sales.  I did not know how to do anything technical.  Porter didn't know how to do anything technical.  And he also didn't have any sales experience.  So yeah, I double whammy.  But the cool part is we've actually",

And they're finally like, dude,  I should have done this two years ago instead of being out  there in the cold and under the sun,  actually doing manual labor,  which there's a hundred percent nothing wrong with that  actually feels really good to do manual labor.  But this allows you to do, to travel, to be wherever,  to be farming.  I like to travel.  I'm in Africa a lot and you can do this from anywhere.  So Porter, I'm going to show a couple more examples,  but you can hop off and go take care of the truck that's  waiting on you, bro.  Okay. Appreciate it.  See ya.  So guys, I'm just going to show you a couple more examples of  some sites that I've done this with.  And then I'm going to hop off.  That's it.  So here's another example.  If you type in, I'll give you one more St. George one.  If you type in St. George epoxy.  So, you know, when you go into your garage and you have like  an epoxy floor where, I mean,  I didn't even really know what this was growing up,  but then you moved to St. George.  I moved to St. George.  A lot of people had it.  So I'll show you the images here.  So this is like an epoxy garage floor right here.  It makes the garage super nice, super clean,  super easy to clean up.  So if you type in St. George epoxy,  you're going to see me right here at the very top.  Again, these are sponsored ads.  So this means they're paying for this.  So I'm actually the number one person here.  This is my website, stgeorgeopoxy.com.  This is my phone number.  If you call this phone number, I get paid.  Okay. And when I say I get paid,  what I mean by that is my business owners I work with,  they pay me a certain amount every single month  for all the phone calls.  You can do different structures where you can have it set up  where every time the phone rings,  they pay you a certain amount.  I don't like to do it that way  because it's a lot of tracking  and there's a lot of back and forth.  I like to just do a flat fee, make it easy.  I'm the business owner, make it easy on me.  But just for the sake of teaching you guys  and showing you guys what the heck it is I do,  if this phone rings, that's how I get paid.  Okay. So let me show you how much money I've made  from this website right here.  Let me see if I can pull up my screenshot.  Let's see here.  Hang tight.  I think it might be this one.  There it is.  Okay.  Nope. That's another one I'm going to show you.  Let me go to this one.  Okay. So this one right here,  once again, guys, see if you can see this.  I don't know if you can see me.  I can't see myself, hold on.  I'm not sharing my screen anymore.  Sorry, guys.  I didn't even show you that last one.  This is the website I was showing you guys, sorry.

If you call this phone number right here, I get paid.  That's what I was trying to say.  So I thought I was sharing my screen  when I was showing you this.  That's another one of my websites.  Here's how much I've made from that website.  So you can see right here, St. George Epoxy leads.  Let's see.  You can see right here.  It doesn't really show the date,  but I just screenshot this right before I came on.  You can see right here, it shows all the way till February.  I don't see anywhere that it shows the actual date.  This one's a little bit lower.  I make $652.23.  Why? Because the jobs aren't worth as much money.  And so I don't get paid as much.  So it's not my favorite niche.  I'd rather go into concrete, but I do have this one.  This guy has been paying me since June of 2020,  and I've made $36,350.  I get paid 150 bucks a week.  Again, 150 bucks isn't gonna make you rich,  but you do that 100 times,  and you're gonna have some nice money coming in.  One thing that's cool about this deal that I did,  I actually, including on top of the money that they paid me,  we actually worked out a deal where this guy did my garage,  and I actually got my garage completely blacked out,  and it looks really, really cool.  So he did that at cost.  I paid for the material.  He actually did the labor.  Okay, let me show you one more website,  and then I'll hop off here.  There's one more deal.  This is another one I did a couple years ago.  Let's see.  Type in Bentonville Concrete.  You're gonna see me here at the top.  You're also gonna see me here.  You're gonna see me that I'm ranked a couple times  on page one, depending on the search term,  but I'm right here at the top.  You click on this.  Another one of my little dinky websites.  Guys, these are not special.  I don't know how to code.  I don't know how to use WordPress.  This is literally built on weebly.com.  This website right here, as soon as you call this,  it goes to my business owner.  It tracks it for me,  and then I send him an invoice every month  and run his credit card.  That's it, okay?  This one, this specific website,  I have made, let me show you here.  Right here.  I have made $52,725.  Now, you see this pass due.  This just means we ran this person's card today,  and it didn't go through.  Maybe he's over the limit or changed cards or whatever,  but what will happen is in two, three days,  we'll hit the card again and it'll run.  So you can see right here, I get paid $978.34  every single month.  It's 225 bucks a week.  I've been working with him since June of 2020.  Ironically, I've actually been working with him longer.  I think I was even working with him the year before,  or six months before that,  but we were running it under a different Stripe account.  But over that",

This website took me probably a week to build,  weeks worth of hours,  so probably 40 to 50 hours worth of time I put into this,  and it's paid me $52,000.  Now, granted, I had to go get the client,  I had to put the deal together.  I do keep the relationship with the client,  but this is, I mean, consider if you knew  you could go spend 50 hours and build something  that was gonna make you $52,000 over the next four years,  wouldn't you do that 100 times?  That's what I've been doing  for the past three, four, five years,  and I've just been stacking these sites,  stacking these sites.  150 bucks a week here, 350 here, 500 there, 100 here,  and these things just continually add up  until you start making quite a bit of money, okay?  So last thing I wanna show you guys really quick,  just for fun, I'll show you a little sample list  of some of my clients here.  I'm not gonna show you their names, obviously,  but I took this screenshot and just blurred out the names.  Just to show you, this is my Stripe account,  did this today, right here, date as of February 18th,  so I guess that's as of yesterday, maybe.  But anyway, you can see right here,  here's my list of clients I'm obviously not gonna show you,  but I've got somebody that's paid me over 132,000.  This one's paid me 64, 57, 54, 52, 47, 46, 36, 35,  33, 32, 29, 29.  This is not all my clients, this is one page of my clients.  You can see right here, these things stack up,  24, 26, 27, 28, all the way up to 132.  And yes, sometimes we have clients  that you start working with,  and then after three to six months, it doesn't work out.  And you go and you part ways and then you take your website.  But here's the beautiful thing, guys,  is when does it work out with the client, right?  So let's say that this specific client  that I'm dealing with here,  let's say this guy calls me and he's like,  hey, I don't wanna buy these leads anymore,  I'm doing something else, I don't have any money,  blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Okay, it's not a big deal because I'm just gonna take  this website, I'm gonna go to my software,  which is, we use this thing called rankandrentengine.com,  and I'm gonna change the phone number  so that when people call this phone number,  it goes to my new business owner.  I'll change it so he's paying me instead of the old guy.  No damage done, it's just like owning properties, right?  If you own a house, you put a tenant in it,  they pay you every month.  If you have to evict that tenant, guess what?  You put somebody else in, they pay you.  That's it, that's the whole game.  Think about this like building houses all over the internet,  but instead of houses, they're",

The way that I look at it is I have, I don't know,  35 to 50 of these websites, I don't know the exact number  that are rented out versus how many we have,  but every single day, while we're talking right now,  these websites are out there collecting phone calls.  When I'm sleeping, when I'm golfing,  when I'm traveling to Africa,  when I'm doing my team meeting,  which I'm about to do here in one minute,  I'm making money from these websites.  It's like, I always think about it like this show,  Despicable Me, and Gru has the minions, right?  And they're literally just working,  and they're just doing stuff for them.  I don't think, if I remember the show right,  they have to eat.  The one thing with these minions is they do have  like personalities and feelings.  These don't have feelings, these don't have personalities,  these don't need time off, these don't need vacations,  these don't need compliments, and you tell them  that they're doing a good job, they just go to work for you.  You build them, you rank them, you set them free,  and they go and they collect dollars for you  all over the internet while you do what you love to do.  So, anyway, for anyone that might have been curious,  maybe you weren't curious at all,  maybe you just think it's annoying that I keep posting this,  I'm sorry, you can unfollow me.  I use these social medias for business,  social media channels for business,  but for those of you that are curious, interested,  whatever, this is how it works.  You build these sites, you rank them,  you rent them out to local business owners,  you get paid, you do it again, you do it again,  you do it again.  You spend your life doing what you love to do  instead of working for somebody else, okay?  That's the whole game.  So, that said, the only thing I'll do really quick,  I have a couple of, if you guys are interested,  I have a free training,  because people are like, how do you learn more,  rentsimplesites.com.  Give me one second.  Rentsimplesites.com, that's a free training.  And then we also have a community,  which is, if you go to rankandretire.com.  Again, no pressure, these are just some resources.  And then I'm actually gonna do this.  I talked to Porter, I have a deal with him,  anybody that he does this with,  I actually make sure he's taken care of,  but I'm gonna drop Porter's number.  If you guys have any questions,  you can literally text Porter, this is his own cell phone,  you can text Porter, and he will text you back,  or hop on a call with you,  and just kinda walk you through it.  So, anyway, if you guys are curious, there you go.  If not, no big deal, thanks for being on the live.  I'm gonna jump onto a team meeting.  Happy February, stay warm,  see you guys on the next one, I'm out.",

So what I would do is do everything that you can  to make sure that they're coming in.  But don't, like a lot of you guys,  I think the leads aren't coming in.  You go and tweak something on Google,  like, oh, negative keywords, change the keywords,  change the budget.  I think every time you do that,  there's like this process, this period of time  that it has to like recalibrate.  Just leave the leads alone.  If you did it right the first time, just leave them alone.  There's nothing else you can do.  And then what I would do is go do what Ashley did,  or not Ashley, it was Tara.  She was right there and she needed like one more lead.  She literally went on Facebook and found somebody  in that area on like a marketplace  that needed a recommendation,  direct messaged them and got an extra lead.  It was the very lead that she used to close the deal.  Nice.  That was very neat.  Like what city is this in?  Richmond.  So go to Richmond, buy, sell, trade, or whatever the group.  Richmond, there's like, you know,  these Facebook groups go in there  and just do smart searches like recommendation  or deck builder.  And there's going to be some posts  and nine times out of 10, you're going to find some,  it's like, hey, who knows a good deck builder,  message them, boom.  It didn't, you didn't come from Google,  but it's a lead is a lead is a lead is a lead.

I mean, there were it was like  100 200 300 searches a month, right? So like, the search  volumes there, but it was getting no impressions after  like eight or nine days. So I just went ahead and pause those.  But um, and I took the number off a call rail, so I wasn't  paying for it. I don't know if that does anything for like  future payments anyway. Um, my question is, do you go back and  test those cities again? Maybe like two weeks down the road,  because maybe like the first time around for for whatever  reason, there was like a glitch in the algorithm or something  happened. And like the second time around, like it actually  performed really well for you. I don't make no sense for those  cities not to be getting zero impressions or two impressions,  three impressions, you know?  Yeah, I definitely will test them out. I'll circle back on  everything. I don't do it two weeks later, though, like I'll  wait a couple months. Okay, because I think it just my head,  I'm always like, I wonder if it has to do because I know, like  on paper, where, you know, you're really close to me. I'm  in, I'm in St. George in Vegas, we're basically like, it's 70  out there. And so I think, like, and I know what the weather is  like in Florida, but also, I, so I'm always like, let's, let's  like, wait till the next season and try it. So I'll pause and  unpause shit. Because, and that's the same way I and I do that.  Because when I used to sell door to door, there would be  neighborhoods that I would give up on, I'd go, I'd knock the  doors, and I had a bunch of freaking douchebags. I'm like,  oh, I screw this neighborhood, I'm never coming back. But then  like a couple months later, I'm like, now I'm going to go back  in there. And then I would get that first deal. And all of a  sudden, I would blow that neighborhood up. And I'm like,  okay, I'm glad I didn't give up on that. So I always serve you  guys, I did a training, like way back when my mood was in town,  on just working your areas. And that's the same for projects,  you guys have projects that like, you want to just pick and  shit on them and like get rid of them and burn into the ground.  Just relax, pause it, go get a deal. Get that momentum, come  back and work on it. And the same with ads, pause it, if you  get rid of your number, whatever, that's fine. And then  just come back, you know, a couple months down the road. So  I would definitely circle background, especially if like  the CPC lines up, and their search volume and the whole  deal, then I would just come back, I would definitely not  give up on that would come back. Because if not, you could shoot  them to me and I'll try them out.  Yeah, I'm definitely gonna try them out again. Because like I  said, everything is perfect. And these are cities that were like,  in between",

I mean, and I have I have a  couple of sites, a few sites in Florida, like Gainesville,  Ocala, you know, Palm Coast, St. Augustine on the East Coast,  I have less population less search volume than those five  did. Yeah, and they were they were getting leads and  impressions left and right. Well, for those five or so, for  whatever reason, they just weren't getting any impressions.  Yeah, I don't know.  Think about it like this. Yeah, I have a site called Cedar City  concrete. I have a site Bentonville concrete, those are  30,000 population. And they're like they're getting 30 like  Cedar City is only getting probably like 10 to 20. But  Bentonville has been doing 30. There is concrete volume in  every city. I don't care where you're at. There's always going  to be some like at least 30,000 plus there's going to be concrete  volume. So yeah, if it's if you're talking 100,000  population, all the metrics are there.

    "pageContent": " And my question is about Google Ads.  So how important is it in the process of this process?  Does it start with Google Ads?  Or is there any other way to do it?  Yeah, so it's up to you guys.  I personally prefer using Google Ads  because I like to pre-sell my sites.  I like to go and get that deal upfront.  However, there's the other way to do it,  which is the traditional way.  I'll call it the traditional way, which is where you go,  you pick a city, you pick a niche, you rank the website,  then you go and sell it.  So if you're somebody, let's say you  don't have a lot of capital and you're  nervous to spend money on ads, I still  would argue it's better to go get the deal upfront.  But maybe you're not confident in your ability  to sell it, whatever, and that's what you want to do.  That is fine.  If you want, you could start at the second half  of the training, build a website, rank it,  and then go and start using the first half of the training  to sell the deal.  So you can do it either way.  I just prefer going into it and getting paid  while the website's ranking.  OK, so when you're running Google Ads,  do you do test out three, four sites or properties,  or you just run with one and then see if it is validated,  or you just stop it, or you continue to sell it off?  So how do you start with three, four properties  at the same time?  When you first start, I would recommend starting with one.  But once you get going and you've gotten that first deal,  you can start adding two.  And then once you figure that out,  you can start adding three.  And then what I do is once one website, one ad  starts to really work.  I start to get leads.  Then I pause the other two and I focus on the one and so forth.  So when you first start, you probably  want to start with one.  Got it?  Awesome, Moin.  Let's go get a deal, brother.  One thing I want to remind you of,  make sure that you're focusing on asking people for money.  Because no matter what you do, no matter how much content you  do, no matter how many backlinks you do,  no matter how many websites you look at,  unless you're asking people for money,  you're not going to make money.  Make sense?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Awesome, Moin, thanks for helping out, brother.  We'll talk soon.  And let's go get a deal, dude.",

Make a comment in the comments that  says, cut on your camera if you want to stay on the call because people are going to join  and not have any idea. So like a good idea. I'll pin that. Yeah, just go ahead and pin  that. Welcome to the call guys. Stoked about what we're going to talk about today. We are,  if you guys can't tell, we're going extremely niche on these topics. We're going very, very  nuanced because this business model is nuanced. There's the high level. And then there's also  the heck. Dude, I got to turn off my notifications, bro. Hold on. I got like all kinds of stuff  coming on, but I've got it. They got, let me just plug this in. But what you'll realize  with this business, what I was saying is that you have the business model, the overall business  model from a high level, build a simple website, rank it, send leads. And then there's so many  nuances and the better you get at the nuances, the more money that you make. And so that's  why we're basically taking this. If you haven't noticed month by month, quarter by quarter,  we're focusing on different steps of the process and going very, very detailed on these steps  of process. So we're still talking about the very first step, which is picking the city  in the niche. But today we're going to talk about the pros and cons of going broad versus  vertical or wide versus narrow, however you want to look at it. So that said, guys, as  always, the reason that we, like I've been saying the last couple of weeks is I think  our, is our fourth call, Aaron, something like, yeah, this is actually our fifth. So  it's our fifth call doing it that this format and I've really enjoyed it. I swear to you  guys, I'd rather have two people on this call that are paying attention than have a hundred  people on a live and Facebook that are not paying attention. So that said, if you guys  stay on this call the entire time cameras on by the end, we're going to screenshot.  We're going to send you guys a digital resource with the notes in like a very easy to digest  manner that you guys can check out. And so then you don't sit there and focus on writing  everything I say down. You can just write down the things that come to your mind that,  Hey, I should do this or here's an idea, that kind of stuff. And then you're going to get  the, the, the digital resource of the notes and kind of the summary of what we talked  about. So that said, keep, make sure once again, keep your cameras on. We want to make  sure that we see your pretty smiling faces. We only let people in here that are serious  about taking action and that's the truth. Okay. So that said, guys, let's get into today's  topic, which is should you go broad or vertical? Aaron, I want to ask you really quick. I didn't  even tell you, I was going to ask you, but when you first started out, I know you probably  know the, what the answer that I would give, but did you start off by going vertical or  did you start off by going broad? Well, I like, and I first found you from this business.  And so I've immediately like adopted your mentality. So it's been that's checked through  the whole time. And that said, it made more sense to get established",

    "pageContent": "in a couple, use  one niche, do that a couple of times to get established. Cause it is easier to just stick  with one niche already know rather than transition. There's different keywords, different lingo,  different pricing, all that sort of stuff, different lead flow. And so it seems easier  to get, get your feet wet, get established with a couple deals in one niche. You don't  want to get reliant on that niche, but get established and then move on with what you  did year by year. Yes, exactly. Okay. Good. Good to know. I'm curious in the comments,  what do you guys think is the best option? And I don't want you to tell me what you think  I want to hear. I want to know what you guys think. I want you to either put broad or vertical  broad meaning you try out a bunch of niches, you, you die, you, what's the word you diversify  or you pick an edge and you go vertical. Which do you guys think again? And by the way, some  of you guys might think that you know the answer I'm looking for. And the thing you  don't know about me or you might not realize about me is I change, I change all the time  because I'm constantly growing and evolving in business. So my answer, you think that  I might be giving you guys, I think some of you guys think you already know what I'm about  to talk about. I might change. I might shock you with the answer I'm going to give you  today because things change, man. Business changes. What worked in 2020 doesn't necessarily  work today. So I am curious in the comments and Aaron, I want you to read the comments.  I've got kind of my notes pulled up here. So I can't really see the comments and I want  to be going back and forth. But let me know what people are saying, narrow or broad.  Yeah. So a paper bully says vertical. So I can focus on building a system. Okay. Kind  of like what I was just saying. Yeah. Depends in France. Theo says I diversify. Okay. That's  interesting. Maybe there's limited cities. So you kind of got to go into different niches  for the bigger cities. Broad in a good city. Shane thought that. No, let me see. Discord  users said too early in my journey. I'm tempted to try broad and local area to start. So yeah.  And then we got one more from Zoom users who said broad to see which niche I vibe with.  Okay. That's interesting. Cool. Okay. Good. All right. That said, one quick thing I should  have started with this. You guys shouldn't listen to what I'm saying. You guys, if you're  brand new to whether it's a Facebook group, the discord channel, and that's how you found  this, you should be asking yourself who the heck is this guy? Why should I listen to him?  And so just my one minute reason why you should potentially consider listening to me is guys,  I've been doing this for a long time. It's been over eight years. Now there was, I always  throw this in because I don't want to make it seem like what it's not, but there was  a eight, nine month period that I had shiny penny syndrome and chased a software company  that completely failed. But for the most part of that eight years, I've been doing this  business model. I spent $1.45 million on ads. I haven't recently checked it, so I don't  know if it's more, but that's the last time I checked. I went $60,000 in debt. I almost  quit",

    "pageContent": "twice. I did the wrong revenue model. I did pay per lead, which I think is completely  the wrong way to do it for a couple of years. I've done everything wrong. And I finally  figured it out in 2020 and realized that in order to scale this business, you need  to presale. That's just how it is. And I know some of you guys are like, Hey, I'm just going  to build it. I'm going to do it the slow way. Guys, the slow way of building a website and  ranking it and then going and selling it is, I don't love this word, but well, I'm not  going to use that word, but it's just stupid. It makes no sense. And the analogy that I  always use, I was talking to one of my friends that's in this business, you going and building  50 websites and then ranking them and then trying to sell them, that is equivalent to  you going and building, let's say 50 or a hundred, whatever, the same amount of houses,  say 50 houses. Imagine going and building 50 houses and realizing that you forgot to  put in toilets. It's so dumb for you to go and do that. And by the way, just so you know,  if you're getting the advice, you should go build 10 or 15 or 20. I would bet the people  giving you that advice are also selling you the tools to build websites. Just a wild guess.  They're probably selling you all kinds of services, tracking numbers, or maybe they're  doing hosting or they're white labeling something. It's in their best interest that you build  more websites. I don't sell any of those services, so I don't care. And I'm telling you right  now, do not go and build a bunch of websites and try to rank them. And this isn't even  what we're talking about, David. We want a little rant here because what you don't know  right now, because you're brand new to this or you're not into this enough, that just  because you build a website does not mean it's going to rank. I have built websites  that have never ranked because it was too competitive. I didn't know what I was doing.  Just because you build a website and it ranks does not mean you're going to get leads. I  had a website in Lincoln, Nebraska in a specific industry, didn't even think to check a certain  search volume and all that stuff. Dude, I never got any leads. I was ranked number one  for all the keywords. There was no business there, right? Now that one, you usually are  smart enough, but I wasn't. Just because you get a website ranked, you get leads, does  not mean you're going to find a hungry business owner. I don't know how long you guys have  been in this business, but for those of us that have been in it and for a minute, we've  all had that situation where you build a website, you rank it, you're getting leads, and you  for the life of you cannot find somebody to take the leads. You couldn't give them away  because everyone in that city is fat and happy and they're just getting tons of leads. There's  a ton of leads or there's not a lot of competition and they're the big dog in town and they're  really not motivated to pay you for leads. So you just went and spent six months all  this time, wrote the content, paid your employees, and now you can't sell it to a business owner,  right? And so what if in a different universe, my universe, you could go, you could spend  a couple bucks on ads, you could go in,",

    "pageContent": "land the deal, get the business owner, know that  there's going to be lead flow, make sure the business owner's hungry, put the deal together,  get the contract, get the credit card, recoup your costs and use their money to build out  the property. And while you're ranking over the next six to eight months, be making money  the entire time. No fool, even a fool would say that's a much better option. So just so  you guys know, that is how you scale. If you guys think you're going to scale by building,  you know, and then by building websites and then renting them, then you haven't been doing  this long enough. And the reason I even figured this out was by force is because I sat there  and I was like, I need to make a hundred thousand dollars a month or I want to, and I'm not going  to keep doing this business unless I can make a hundred thousand. And I started doing my projections  and I started doing my spreadsheets and I started going, all right, it's going to cost me how much  for the hosting, how much for the tracking numbers, it's going to take me how long to rank.  And I've got employees and I've got content, I've got this, I've got that. And statistically  looking at my websites, only 30% or 50% of them actually work. And then I got to sell them all.  And I started doing the math and it just didn't make sense. I was like, I'm going to have to go  another 20 grand in debt and wait six months before I can even start selling these websites,  guys. And that's what I'm like, dude, this isn't going to work unless I can pre-sell.  And that's it. And that's why the big construction companies do exactly this. I was just, you guys  know I'm in Dubai or maybe you don't, I'm in Dubai. I was at dinner with a friend on Saturday night.  He's like, dude, I'm going to this, he's like, I'm going to this presentation tomorrow. I'm like,  okay. It's actually today. He went this morning. He's like, I'm like, what's it for? He's like,  well, there's this company and it's a company called EMAR. It's one of the largest, it might  be the largest or if not one of the largest construction companies in the world. And basically  he's like, you go in there, they're taking everyone's money upfront. You pay for the project  and you pay your down payment. And then every six months you make a payment and then it's  going to be done in two years. And by the time it's finished, it's going to be worth more than  you bought it for. So I'm like, dude, that's really smart for you because you don't have to pay  everything upfront. Plus it's going to be worth more, but it's even more smart for the company  because guess what? They're pre-selling the building. They're literally raising capital  from you, the user. They're saying, hey, I'll build this house once you agree to pay me for it.  It's genius. So if the biggest companies in the world, EMAR that's in Dubai, that's built half  this freaking city is doing this. Don't you think there's a lesson to be learned? And actually,  funny enough, I've been doing this for years and I just barely heard this on Saturday and I made  the connection. I'm like, huh, even these guys are doing it. So if there's just a little bit of  a reason why maybe you should listen to",

And that's why I go and I make all these mistakes and I lose this money. And I'm like,  oh, yeah, that's a good idea. Maybe I should try this. So that's why I'm here. Instead of you  going and touching the stove and making sure it's hot, I could tell you it's hot telling you right  now there's things you need to do. There's things you shouldn't do today. I'm going to do that exact  same thing. So my goal for today, guys, is I want to give you all the pros and cons of going both  broad and vertical. And I'm going to give you enough information that you can make a decision  on which one you are going to choose as you start building your digital real estate empire, or as  you continue to build it if you've already started. Now, one little caveat I want to mention  is I am going to do my best to cover as much as possible. And I do want to leave time for Q&A  because I haven't been doing a good job of that. But I'm going to give you most likely enough  to get started. I can't cover in the next 45 minutes enough that you have all the information  that you can go and make millions of dollars. The reality is I can't.  I'm here to give you enough to get started and to give you some inspiration to get started and  take your first steps. And so I'll use this analogy because I could literally spend 10  hours talking about this one subject today because I've been doing it for so long.  So it's kind of like this. I'm the guy I'm going to give you enough confidence that you're going  to go buy a pair of gym shoes and you're going to get into the gym and you're going to know  enough to not feel stupid. You're going to be able to walk around, know how to do bench press,  do a couple biceps, whatever. That's what I'm doing on these calls. I'm going to give you enough  that you don't feel stupid and you have enough like, okay, let me get started. But you cannot  expect to go into that gym to know exactly, I want this body, which muscle should I work out?  How should the sets be laid out? How should I do supersets? Should I not do supersets? Should I  do this? Should I be humble with my rest days? What's my diet? You can't expect to know that  unless you go and hire a trainer. So that said, guys, those people like me, a couple years ago,  I was like, I want to get the best shape of my life. I went and found somebody that had the body  I wanted my age and was completely natural, hired them, spent 20 grand sick. I literally got six  zoom calls with this person and it changed everything the way I was. I was doing everything  wrong. And I've been training for at that point over 10 years, 12 years, and they completely blew  my mind. They gave me information that they spent 10 years getting. So I want to tell you this up  front, because if you guys want the actual exact stuff, then you got to hire the trainer. That's  why we have the digital landlord program. But I want to give you enough to get started to have  enough confidence to just put one foot forward and get going. Okay. So here's going to be the  outline today. And I am going to leave time for Q&A. I'm going",

    "pageContent": "to cover what exactly I mean by  broad versus vertical. We'll go really quick on that because most people know what I'm talking  about. I'm going to cover my experience doing broad first and then doing vertical. I'm going  to talk about why life and this business is not black and white and varying shades of gray. And  you'll know what I mean when I get to that. I'm going to talk about exactly what I did to scale  and then I'm going to talk about the sweet spot and how is that digital resource.  So let's do this. Aaron, at any point, if we have questions that seem relevant, please let me know.  Is everyone still good? Aaron, can you hear me?  Yeah, everything's great. Everyone's turned on the cameras. It's awesome to see everyone's  faces. I'm just messaging this person who just joined. Love it. Love it. Love it. Love it. Okay,  guys, let's get into it. So what do I mean by, and I want to keep this to 20 minutes tops,  maybe 15. I want to leave Q&A. So guys, if you have Q&A, if you have questions you want to ask,  start prepping them. You could literally throw them in the comments right now so you don't forget  and I'll try to get to as many as possible. So I'm going to keep this less than 20 minutes. What  do I mean by broad versus vertical? I'm going to keep it short. Broad is wide. Vertical is narrow.  Broad means you decide to go into a bunch of different niches and vertical or narrow means  you go into one niche and you go into a bunch of different cities. Okay, that's it. Very, very  simple. Broad I think can be determined by or defined as two things because you could do a bunch  of different niches in multiple cities or you could do a bunch of different niches in the same  city. Okay, so that's what I mean by broad versus vertical. So let me tell you guys about my  experience with doing broad first and then vertical. So when I got into my first training program,  I learned a lot by the way and I needed it to get going. This is back in 2016. I wasn't ready to  get it. I didn't even know I was buying it and then I was like, you know what, rather than trying  to figure it out, whatever. So I bought it and I got this advice that I'm going to tell you,  which I think is the wrong advice. And the reason it was the wrong advice is because it was outdated  advice. And the reason it was outdated advice is because the person that created the program  was not in the business. And that's why I'm always so adamant about letting you guys know I am still  in this business. I am literally, I was just on the phone with Francesca on Saturday, Saturday  at 9 p.m. before I met this guy for dinner. I was just talking about, I was on a call with Francesca  and she was doing a sales call, right? And then we were talking about, she's got, we're still  doing this, man. We're still literally in this business because if we're not, how the heck am  I going to train you guys? So I got this advice from this first training that I bought and they  said go and build 10, I think it was like 10 websites in 10 different niches. That was the  advice. Go build 10 websites in 10 different niches. So that's what I did. I went and built  10 different websites in 10 different niches. Now I didn't do it right away because I",

My second one was this service called  crawl space encapsulation. No, yeah, that was my second one. Then I built, did carpet cleaning.  Then I did landscaping. Then I did, I'm trying to even think. I mean, they were terrible. Really,  really bad ideas. So I can't even remember the other five, but I just did a bunch, right?  And at the time I was living in Alabama. I was living in Huntsville, Alabama, knocking door. So  my first five, three to five were in Huntsville, Alabama, right? Which means that my due diligence  process was terrible because one of the chances that it's low-hanging fruit and not competitive  in the same city, zero. And then when I moved back to Utah, after I got done with that job,  I built the rest of my five in that city. So I didn't know what I was doing, but I got this  advice, build 10 niches, try them out, see what you like, whatever. And I think one of the people  that made a comment said that they want to try it out and see what they like. My advice to that is  I don't care what I like. I like what makes money. Now, you don't have to be like me.  If you want to make sure that you love the niche and you're interested in the niche and it's  whatever, that's more important to you than the money that you make, then that is completely  okay. But for me, I like what makes money. And that's why I do this business. Because even though  building simple websites and renting them out isn't as cool as telling people I do jet rentals  or I do jet charters or I sell Rolex watches or I sell cigars, it's kind of like sexy business.  You know what's sexy about this business? Not working for a month and making a hundred thousand  dollars in a month. You know what's sexy about this business? Deciding you're going to go to Dubai  when you're in Vegas with your friends and driving to LA and taking a direct 16 hour flight to Dubai  to stay for a month and business as usual. That's sexy. So I don't care what the business is. I  don't care what the niche is. If it makes money, I'm passionate about that. That's just my take.  I did the broad thing and my experience in it is that I spent the entire time  learning and relearning all these different niches and I could never become the expert.  It was always really tough. I never got the confidence because the first one I got was  towing. And it was really tough to take my confidence from getting the towing deal  and be like, yeah, but I did this for towing. It's going to work for crawl space. It's not as  easy as if I would have got the towing and then went into another towing and then another towing  and I would have been able to show example after example after example. My experience is I wasted  a lot of time learning new niches and I never became the expert and I was never able to build  momentum because I didn't know the lingo and I didn't know the gossip within. You guys,  it's funny. Even inside big business, even inside industries, there's like gossip and there's big  names and there's rumors and there's scandals and there's all kind of stuff. And when you know these  little things, dude, it goes so freaking far and there's conferences and there's marketing  companies that are always called the same companies and",

    "pageContent": "you know these little things by being inside  of one industry. So in my experience, doing the 10 niches did not work well for me. Then what I  tried to do is I tried to do one niche in 10 different cities. Now because I'm so not that  smart sometimes, I did this. I'm thinking I'm going to do one niche in 10 different cities.  I got the wrong niche. So if you're going to do that, make sure you got the right niche  because at the time I didn't have someone telling me, hey, go into a tried and true niche  and build in 10 different cities. In my opinion, out of the two, I would rather you  choose a tried and true niche and build in 10 cities than choose 10 different niches.  That's just my opinion. But I did, I was like, cool, I'm going to build in the same niche,  10 different cities. Except for guess what, Nick, you forgot to make sure the niche was right. And  I went to do a niche called foundation repair and it was an accident and one of them worked and the  next nine did not. And not only did I go into 10 different cities, I went into about 50 different  cities. And this is one of the things that really got me into debt because I thought I was in this  really good niche. Meanwhile, I was in an uber competitive niche that I was getting my tail  kicked in. And that was a couple deals away from going into debt, which is exactly what happened.  And I went $60,000 in debt. Okay. Finally, what I realized between doing these two extremes is  that it's actually a combination of both that matters. It's about finding the right niche  and then going into the right cities. Okay. But based on the experience that I just told you,  I would much rather you go into a boring tried and true niche, a concrete tree surface, artificial  grass, masonry, fencing, you know all the ones that talk about duck cleaning, go into 10 cities  is a much better strategy than going into 10 niches. Okay. That's just my two cents. Okay.  But also I'm the kind of guy that's like, I wouldn't go and build 10 right out the gate either.  I'd go and get 10 deals by using the pre-selling method. Okay. So that was my experience. And by  the way, here in just a second, I'm going to get to what I would do today because I don't know if  it would be the exact same. The other thing I want to cover really quick is that guys, I used to  think that life was just black and white, right? There's good people. There's bad people. There  was rich people. There was poor people. There was the right and wrong answer to everything.  And then what you learn as you get older or as you get, I guess, burnt or as you get, I don't  know, but you just learned that life is just varying shades of gray. Okay. And so the answer  that I'm going to give you at the end is not going to be either or, just as a little teaser. I'm going  to give you a bit of a hybrid, if I may. Okay. So one thing I want you guys to just remember is  that there are other factors that come into play. So for example, I would never advise anyone to go  into California, any part of California. However, if you live in California and you have family  members that have businesses in California, you may be able to go into California and make money,  right? But that's a one-off. So I just want to remind you guys that",

There are varying shades of gray, and you may have a situation that makes  you uniquely equipped to do something that maybe the rest of us can't, right? You may be a turf  supplier that supplies turf to, or your salesperson or supplier, whatever, that sells turf to local  contractors, in which case you have a completely different competitive advantage than we do. But  so I just want to point that out that like it's not completely black and white. Okay. So one more  thing I want to talk about, and then I'm going to get into what I would do today in the last 10  minutes is, guys, what I did when I scaled, this is in 2020, things have changed, things do change,  but what I had to do is in 2020, I had to get very simple. I had to get very focused. I had to get  very dialed in. And so for me, because my brain, I can't really focus on a bunch of things at once.  I do better if I know I'm going to do this one thing and I'm going to do it very well. I'm going  to do it again and again and again, and I'm just going to get good at it. That's how my brain works.  I had to just literally focus on one niche that was tried and true. And in 2020, that was Tree  Service for me. And I had to spend all of my time focusing on how do I pre-sell? How do I set up  ads and get people to pay me before I actually build a website? A, and then B, how do I actually  have a formula to know that this specific city for Tree Service, I have a 97% confidence that I  am going to be able to rank within three to six months? That was what I focused on. One niche,  how do I pick, how do I develop a formula that is tried and true with a 97, 95% confidence? And then  how do I pre-sell? That's what I focused on. I had to go into one niche. And to be honest, guys,  you guys know my story or maybe you don't, but I think I shared a little bit of it earlier.  That was what allowed me to go from barely making money, barely paying the bills,  $8,000 to $10,000 a month to eight months later, July of 2020. I remember I was sitting at Lake Powell  and my brother-in-law was like, how's business? And we're actually camping. Now we aren't even  on a houseboat, which is awful by the way. It's sandy, it's windy, but I remember just sitting  there. And while I was at Lake Powell, I had my two sales guys at the time had both closed a deal  for a thousand bucks each, 250 bucks a week. I'd gotten two new deals. And if I annualize that out,  thousand bucks times 12, 12,000 bucks times two, I put $24,000 in new revenue into my business. And  I wasn't even there. Things were going well. And yeah, I remember telling him, I was like, yeah,  dude, I think they're going really well. And I did the math and I was like, dude, we did $100,000.  Like we're going to do $100,000 this month. And it was in July that we actually did $100,000.  So that's how quickly this changed. Now that was in 2020, knowing what I knew at that point  with the experience I had in business. And so what I want to cover last in this",

Would I do a combination of both?  And yeah, anyway, and this is what I'm going to tell you is I think that there is a sweet spot.  I think that there is, I don't think you should do either. I don't think you should just do  one niche. I think that there's kind of a combination. And the reason why I'm saying  this is because, you know, I just went into tree service and it worked, but luckily tree  service is an industry. I didn't even think about this. Luckily tree service is a service where  heaven forbid you have a tree falling on your house. But if you do, whether the economy is  good or bad, you got to get it taken care of. You just have to. The other thing in 2020 is  unknowingly I went into cities that didn't have extreme weather. Does that make sense? I didn't  go into, you know, Minnesota and North Dakota and all this stuff where my business completely,  you know, changed during the winter. And so I'm trying to just look at this and let you guys know  it wasn't because I was so good. It was because I did a couple of things right. And then I got  lucky on the rest. I went into the right cities unknowingly. And I mean that like in the right  climates. I picked the right niche unknowingly. Imagine if I had picked a niche that was kind of  tied to the economy. Imagine in 2020 I had picked pool installation. By the way, I don't know if you  guys knew this, but like pool installation in 2020, 2021, I think even into 2022, dude, it was  unbelievable. Unbelievable. Fiberglass pools, shotcrete pools, everybody was getting a pool  because guess what? Not only were they getting stimulus checks or whatever, PPE loans, whatever  we were getting, but also the interest rates were so low everyone was taking out a HELOC on their  house and throwing in a pool. Imagine I had built my business on pool installation. Guess what would  have happened by the end of 2022? My business is gone because nobody's putting in pools now. And of  course people are putting in pools. I'm saying relative to what was happening in 2020, nobody  is putting in pools. My entire street, I think out of like the 20 houses, there's two that don't have  pools. It was insane. I couldn't even sleep after like 6 a.m. because we had jackhammers because we  live on like a mountain, like on a rock and they had to drill through the rock. So I want you guys  to understand that it's not black and white. Just because that worked for me in 2020 does not mean  that if you go into tree service today and today is only tree service, it's going to work the exact  same. It's not. So I just have to let you guys know. The other thing is you have to realize there's  unforeseeable things like the economy. I didn't anticipate the economy was going to do what it's  doing right now. And if I would have gone into pools and built my entire business on that,  gosh dang, that would have been tough. So I like the idea of a bit of diversification so that  I can guard myself against unforeseeable things like law changes, economy factors, etc. Again,  these are things I've learned by being in this business for eight years. And also we can kind ",

    "pageContent": "of like extract, if you kind of like zoom out a bit and you can relate this to business in general,  right? Because I stuck with one business and I just went in, I've been in one business and  I've been focusing on one business instead of eight. Yes, at times I've got shiny penny syndrome.  I've been able to scale this one business to make millions of dollars and I've got friends that have  eight businesses, 10 businesses, three businesses, four businesses that are making a quarter of what  I'm making even though they've got more businesses, right? So keep in mind that this principle I think  applies as you zoom out as well to business in general, okay? Here's what I would do. If I  was starting today, I would go into, for your first two to three deals, I would go into one niche and  I would make sure that that niche was tried and true, okay? One niche, tried and true. And when  I say one niche of tried and true, it's the ones I always talk about, okay? Concrete, tree service,  spray foam, artificial grass, masonry, fencing, da da da da da. They're tried and true. You know  they're going to work. You know they're going to, once you get leads and you get a good city,  it's going to work. Until you get two to three deals, you should not be changing niches. You  should just go get two or three deals. And the reason I don't just say one is because if you get  one, you may as well get two or three because you've already learned all the keywords for that niche.  You already have learned the lingo and what the good services are, where the money is made,  and you can name drop, and you can use the momentum to get two or three. So my recommendation,  what I would do if I was going today is I'd go one niche for my first two to three deals, okay?  That's step one. And that would be in a tried and true, boring niche. Step two is that I would go  into two to three boring niches. So I might expand out a bit. So, okay, let's say I got three tree  service sites. Now, just to diversify a bit, I might add another boring niche. I'm not going  to go into freaking yacht rentals right out the gate. I'm not going to go into assisted living,  which, by the way, assisted living is terrible. I've never done yacht rentals. I'm just giving  you examples. But if you do want to expand, you could also just stay in one niche and go to 10k,  get out of your job, whatever. But to diversify a bit, what I would do is I would add one or two  niches. I'd have max three boring niches. And I would learn everything about those two to three  niches until I get enough deals to get to 10k. And 10k being representative of the amount of money  to live. Because usually at 10k net, you could pretty much pay your bills. Now, some of you guys  live really lavishly, maybe not. Some of you guys, that's probably way more than you need.  But I would stick in the two to three niches until I hit enough to pay my bills comfortably.  And this is my main thing. Because I'm guessing most of you guys, maybe not all, but most of you  guys are probably still working a job, doing other stuff. Maybe it's another business and  you're trying to make this your main thing. So step one, one niche for your first two to three  deals. Step two, either keep scaling that one niche",

You can quit  your job with confidence. Okay. Step three is I would keep scaling those two to three niches  and I would focus on those two to three niches only. And I would not go and test other niches  because now you've already done the work. You've got the keywords, you know, the lingo, you know,  the rumor, you know, the gossip, you know, the companies, the vendors, everybody uses,  you know, what the conferences are, you know, the good times, you know, the bad times, you know,  when it's slow, you know, when it's hot, you know, when people are spending their money on their tax  dollars on doing the service, you know, everything about these niches, why would you go change?  Okay. I'm not changing. I'm not going out of three, three max is my, if I'm doing this today,  I would not go above three until I get to at least $50,000 a month, at least 50k per month.  And guys, I wouldn't test another niche. Even if I'm making $25,000 a month net and I have the  money to spend, I'm a single person. I don't have bills to pay. I don't got baby mama drama and  child support and all these different things that some of us have to do. I still would stick to what  you know. And the only time I would test a new niche, the only time I would never do it on my  own, I would do it when referrals came in. I've talked about this at length, but as you guys stay  in business, this is another great thing about staying in business is as you guys continue to  do this and you're the leads guy, you're the guy that knows how to get business and get the phone  to ring, you start getting people sending you messages. You start getting your clients that  you're doing a really good job for calling you saying, Hey, my brother's in this business over  here. Can you get him leads? When you get those referrals and those are in different niches,  that's a really good time to test different niches. And so instead of me going, Hey, I'm going to try  a yacht rental. I got a call from, I'll give you an example. I had a client I was doing masonry for  in Phoenix, Arizona. Okay. And it was a sub niche of masonry and we crushed it. They're paying us  like a thousand bucks a month and they let us know, we had no idea. They let us know after a while,  they had this other business called cactus removal. And I remember my sales guy called me. He's like,  Hey, he wants cactus removal, removal leads. And I'm like, what? Who knew that was a business  cactus removal? Literally you go and remove cactuses, right? This is why this, this by the  way, guys, side note, this is why this business is never going to be saturated. Cactus removal,  cactus rule, right? And dude, I never would have even thought of it. A B I would have never spent  my own money to go put up a landing page and run ads. And no, absolutely not. Right. However,  I told my sales guy, I said, okay, well, we have no idea what's going to happen, but you can tell  him that if he",

He's going to need to  help us with an address, all that stuff. And it should work, but we've never done cactus. And  that's the truth. And so, you know, and it's probably going to cost a little bit more because  it looks like, you know, we're going to have to learn the this and that and the rest and our team's  going to have to learn the keywords. And so I basically told my sales guy to quote him high.  And so for the masonry deal, we were making like a thousand bucks a month. And he went back to,  by the way, I remember I was on the golf course. I even remember the golf course. I even remember  the exact hole because my sales guy threw me off when he told me cactus removal. And I was like,  what? Because we were trying to hit a goal as a company. And I was like, you know what,  just give him this offer. And he calls me back by about like the eighth or ninth hole. We were just  finishing the round. And he's like, he said, yes, he's in. And I'm like, dope, let's do it. I'm like,  have the team build it. And guys, the crazy part is, is we took the money up front. We had him pay  for the full first month. It was like 1200 bucks. I think it was. And I could be wrong. So it might  have been 1500. It might've been 1100. I don't know. It was over a thousand. And we took the money. We  used his money to build the website, to buy the domain, to build the content. We used his photos,  all that stuff. He basically did everything for us and we own the property. And guys, that property,  that project crushed it. It absolutely crushed it. We got leads left and right. There was no  competition. We ranked quickly. We didn't have to spend that much on ads. And it was just freaking  gravy. And I had no risk, right? I didn't have to go and do my research on, oh, his practice.  He wanted the leads bad enough that he was willing to give us money up front. And I'm like, yeah,  I'll educate myself on your dime. And I did that because I would have been willing to make  zero dollars to know that that niche was not good. Okay. However, keep in mind, the principle  behind this is I did not seek it out. I did not say, you know, I'm not satisfied with these two to  three niches that are making me all this money. I need to go look at another one. No, I waited until  I got that phone call until my sales guy talked to him enough that he's like, yeah, can you get  me cactus removal leads? And I was like, yeah, same thing. Guys, you want to know how I got into  artificial grass? I didn't go into a new niche. I was still comfortable, man. I was doing concrete.  I was doing tree service. Tree service was in, uh, tree service was in 2020, 2021. I was still  kind of doing tree service. Um, and yeah, still doing, honestly still doing tree service. But at  the beginning of the year, I had somebody come to my house to give me a quote for artificial grass.  And they asked me if they could, if, if I could get them leads, that was",

That's like being in a relationship you're  super happy with and everything's flowing. You're like, dude, I'm going to, I'm going to go, I need,  I need to go get a side chick or side guy. Like it's stupid, right? You're, you're,  you're self sabotaging, right? That's just my two cents. So step one, one niche to get your first  two or three deals. Step two, you can expand into two or three boring niches, but pick them wisely  and keep them boring. And when I say boring, tried and true, because you know, they're going  to work and learn them and perfect them and be in those, make them everything to you until you get  to at least those two to three. Like I'm sticking in those until I get to 50 K. Okay. And I'm not  going outside of it until somebody approaches me. Okay. And guys, another thing is as you crush it  for your clients, they're going to refer you to people. They're going to want you to get leads  for their other businesses. They're going to want to tell their, they're going to tell their friends,  their family about you. You are going to get deals if you take care of your clients. Okay.  And then lastly, I put this is like, once you guys get to 50 K plus, if you want to go test new  niches for the fun of it, go do it. And I did do a bit of that. Like I went into golf lessons,  I went and got a golf lesson. I was like, I wonder if this would work. And I did golf lessons.  I got leads. It just, it wasn't enough. It wasn't that the margins were that great. The guy wasn't  super hungry. It was just kind of fun. I did assisted living because my brother-in-law was  in assisted living. He's like, Hey, I think we could do this. There was, I think there were  some regulations. We didn't really do much with that. I think I spent like a thousand bucks  testing that out. I tried, what else did I try out? I tried out some interesting stuff  that a lot of it didn't work to be very honest with you. But once you get to 50 K plus, I think,  okay, you're fine. You want to go do some stuff for fun. Great. But still, as I look at that,  I still didn't really make that much money. It's always better when you have a hungry customer  come to you because you already have the customer in the bag. Now you just have to go with the leads.  Okay. So that said guys, that is the sweet spot. That's how I would attack it today.  Now, the thing that we've talked about in previous lives, these Monday lives, we talked about how to  pick the perfect city, which by the way, we're not talking about today because I've covered that  before. But if you don't, you could do all this and you pick the wrong city. You're screwed. You're  screwed. Right. That's what I did. Right. I was going and I didn't know what the right city was.  And I went and built in all kinds of different cities and I wasn't making money.

So what we're going to do now, guys, is I told Aaron,  because we're going to start doing this for those of you that are on this call and you're like,  like I was when I got into this business, I didn't have time to waste.  I absolutely did not have time to waste. I wasn't interested in trying to piece  all this together. I told Aaron to have the link ready. So Aaron, in the comments, if you want to  drop the link, I'm only saying this because I know that there's going to be that one, two,  three people on this call that are like, Hey, this is great. I want to go fast. I want to get  out of my job. I'm tired of it. I was at that point. And so for those people, if you guys want  to apply, that's the link to digital analysts. You don't have to go find it. I was in the situation.  I'll just let you know this, that I got, I knew I wanted to do this model, but I was probably like  a lot of you guys. I was like, I'm going to do it after I get done doing door to door sales this  summer. That was my goal. That was my plan. I'm going to go make money. Guys, I got to Alabama  and my license to knock doors was expired. It hadn't been approved and I couldn't knock,  like legally couldn't knock. So I had to go with my manager, my co-manager, we co-manage his team.  And I basically had to shadow him. I couldn't even pitch like legally. I was running the risk  of getting in trouble. So I shadowed him the very first day. Didn't make any money. I'm  shadowing this guy. And I remember about two hours in, two hours into my very first day,  I had four or five months ahead of me of knocking door six days a week. I knew I was like, I'm not  going to make it unless I get, unless I get something going right now, I'm not going to  mentally make this for the next four or five months. I'm just not. And that day I went home  and I started watching videos and I started, I'm like, I have to do this. And within a week,  I'd been on a call and I was going through training and I was spending my, I spent my entire summer  knocking doors, doing my job and building websites, learning how to build websites,  learning how to do content and just trying to figure this out. And it sounds exhausting  because I didn't have that much time or energy, but it was so fun because I could not,  I could not even fathom how fun it would be, how exciting it would be to be able to not knock doors  and just make money from my laptop. That, that idea of that drove me so much. I stayed up till  midnight every night and just worked on my stomach, on the floor, on the carpet. After I ate my  chipotle and showered and I was just learning and it was fascinating. I could, I could make money  from my computer. Are you kidding me? So for those of you that are in that situation, Hey,  I'm done with my job or my situation or whatever. There's the link Aaron dropped it. And that said, ",

    "pageContent": "guys, let's go through Aaron. I'm going to have you read any of the questions just because I don't  want to distract my mind. Is there any questions that we need to cover? Yeah, for sure. So let me  quickly just say, by the way, Arunava, he's talked, asked if he could have the recording for,  I think he's talking about the previous slide. We're not giving out those recordings. We were  only giving out like a three of max and we've already given out those to people, but we'll  send you the recording for this live Arunava. So you don't need to worry about that, but also  tell him and let everyone know we are going to be doing a giveaway on Friday and we're going to be  giving away the whole stack of the last five lives. And we're going to get to, you know,  we should do, let's do two, let's do two. We're going to give two people the full stack and then  we could even maybe we could give one away just to somebody in this group. So keep an eye out.  If you're not in the free group, we're going to be giving away the last five recordings.  And guys, we're purposely doing this because people aren't taking this like as serious as  we want them to for the amount of time and effort we guys, we literally have full-time  people monitoring that group that are getting paid. Like go find another Facebook group that  has a paid person, multiple paid people monitoring a free group. What do we have? Three people that  are employed full-time by me that are running that group plus me, plus you. I mean, it's insane. So  anyway, keep going. Yeah, for sure. And so Ed said, do you always go for a $1,000 website rental  price tag? Like is the minimum. When I first started, no, I accepted my first, it was like  $600. But ever since I got my first thousand dollars, yeah, it's unless I, I don't even know  last time I did less than a thousand. A thousand is kind of like the starting point. And that's  before this thing inflated. So I would, you guys should not be charging anything less than a thousand.  You're crazy too. And some of you guys are like, well, if you can't fathom charging a thousand,  you're the wrong niche. Right. There's just too many opportunities, like opportunity costs.  A hundred percent. Theo says, what will you do if you had to do Legion only in your state, Utah,  for scale, stay narrow or go wide? Well, I would ask why that, why you, so he's asked, he's from  France, right? Theo, yeah, pretty sure. Okay. So he's basically asking that because he's in France.  He's in France. He wants to target France. Okay. So that's, that's the real question is if I was  going to do it in France. So what I would do is I would just do the same thing. I would go and figure  out like, Hey, how can I go into two to three really? Well, my first, as my advice was go pick  one niche, get your first two to three deals in the one niche. And then from there become the expert  in that and then branch out into two to three niches and go countrywide. Now, if you're just  going to stick in France and I'm guessing because he's thinking there's a language barrier, by the  way, guys, if you think that there's an accent barrier, language barrier, whatever, it's not,  it's not what you think. If you can get",

    "pageContent": "them leads up front, you can go into any country in the world  just so you know. But I know what you're asking this. So what I would say is for your situation,  this is why I said it's not black and white. You might have to go into a few more niches  than two to three. You might have to be in five. So that's going to be a little bit challenging  because you're going to have to be the expert of five. But if you're choosing to only stick  into France, then that that might be the case. So that'd be my answer.  Awesome. That makes sense. OK. And then Ed said this might be for another day, but please briefly  touch on picking a city. You've also done a couple of YouTube lives on this that are they are different  from the ones we just did with the zoom lives here. But those are also just other angles at  looking at the diamond that is making a city. Yeah. And I'll give I'll give two or three things.  And then also, again, just as a reminder, as I said before, like even with these two or three  things, each one of these things, I could talk for an hour plus on. So I'm going to get the two  or three things, Ed. But just so you know, this is again, I don't know if you were on at the  beginning when I gave the example of the trainer. It's like the purpose of these lives is to give  you enough to get started. And now you're asking the right questions right now. You're like, OK.  And once you get into this, Aaron, you probably realize this, too, right? It's like when you  hear the concept, like, yeah, that's easy. I remember hearing the first podcast on this.  I'm like, yeah, for sure. And I even went, dude, I even went to Weebly and I was like,  what do I do? And then I was like, how do I get a free? And I got a Google voice number.  And then after I wasted like four hours, I'm like, yeah, let me just get the blueprint. Let  me go find somebody that's teaching this. But like, you don't really know how much you don't  know until you start getting into this. And that's the whole point, guys. I want you to get in.  The first step is the hardest. It's the hardest to put on your gym shoes and get to the freaking gym.  And then you could figure everything else out. So my goal is to inspire you to get started.  And then if you guys want to either spend the next five years at the gym, try to figure  everything out, asking this person, ask that person, watching YouTube video, following this,  following that, doing this, make a mistake, not losing weight. That's cool. That's one way.  Or you can just go to the guy that looks how you want to look or the girl looks how you want to  look, say, hey, what's your what's your feet? Can you just tell me what to eat, what to train,  how to rest? Well, that's it. So that said, guys, city, it has nothing to do with population,  has everything to do with volume, volume versus competition. I typically like to go into the  smallest cities possible with adequate search volume. And the only reason I say that is  typically speaking, the smaller the city, the lower the competition, not always.  Other than that, I stay out of certain states.  If cities near me fit the bill, I love it because heck, I can drive to them. I can drop the fact  that",

    "pageContent": "I'm local. I have a local phone number. I also like to look at trends. I like to make sure  like, hey, for example, I'm in Dubai right now. I could tell you right now, for those of you that  want to test out new countries, Dubai is a country. It's not getting less popular. It's only getting  more popular. And there's certain cities in states, Los Angeles is not getting more popular.  People aren't getting more interested in Los Angeles. I'm telling you that right now.  So these are some of the factors from a high overview that I like to look at. We went into  detail that week. Also as a side note, anyone that's on this call that's in Digital Landlords,  this entire library is inside of the training as well. And Aaron, can you make sure that we  let Isaac know to put this library inside of the training? Yeah, for sure. I see Stephanie's answer.  We'll definitely get you taken care of there. What's up, Stephanie? Good to see you, Stephanie.  Any other questions? Yeah, so we got some really good ones. And actually, I'll take a screenshot  for you next so we can address things like if you want to do YouTube videos, but we won't be  able to probably get to them all. Okay. Let's rapid fire for the next three minutes.  Yeah, let's do it. So what is the maximum amount, Theo says, what is the maximum amount  billed per month for a single service for a business owner? Max? I had for a single service  or a single site, because I've charged as much as like $3,000 per month for one single website,  one client. But I've also had clients that they pay me $1,000 to $2,000 per location and I've  expanded and grown them to $30,000 a month. I've done both. So there's no max. It just depends on  the niche. There's a niche called pole barns, I think it's called. I've never done it. It's like  metal buildings or it's like a specific type of metal building. I don't even know what it is. And  we have one of our students that's doing it and he was charging like $5,000 a month retainers  because they're such big jobs. So there's no max. That's the beautiful thing. That's the beautiful  thing. Just be careful you don't sell out of your own wallet. To you, if $5,000 a month seems like  a lot, that doesn't mean it's a lot for everybody. $5,000 a month doesn't scare me because I'd spend  that on one person that's consulting us on one thing inside of our business right now. But to  you, because you're just starting, that might be your entire salary. So don't sell out of your own  wallet. Remember that that's not expensive to everybody. Keep going.  For sure. This one I like super easy from Arunava. He says, for charging $1,000 a month,  that means I need to choose high ticket boring niches. The response would be yes. So like,  okay, like it's, it's easy to get 10 concrete leaves and get like 50 plumbing or towing weights.  Why, why, why, yeah, why, why? Just make it easy.  Yeah. And then also the, I missed this one. Shane says, do you feel that the tried and true niches,  concrete tree service, et cetera, are saturated or will get saturated?  I think that they're more saturated than they were, but I think there's so many deals. Like  I'm",

    "pageContent": "going to give you an example. I just made a YouTube video. By the way, if you guys aren't  subscribed to me on YouTube, I do completely different content than I do in my free groups.  It's, and I'm just saying that because I like, I put, I made a YouTube video before I got on this.  I was making a YouTube video showing a niche literally like a couple of days ago.  I was showing Bentonville concrete. In fact, go guys, go look at this video. It's like my last  uploaded video, second to last uploaded video. And I've made $46,000 from this one website.  And as I'm doing the freaking live video, the second person that's ranked is a lead generator.  And instead of being pissed, I was like, cool. Somebody saw my videos, went and did the research  and realized that there's another opportunity to come in, rank a website and go get a client.  So are you going to run into more lead generators? Yes. Is there still deals? Yes. Would I go into,  would I focus solely on concrete after we've talked about it for two years?  I don't know. Maybe, maybe not, but there's masonry, there's artificial grass, there's  duck cleaning, there's freaking pole barns, there's metal buildings. Like I'm breaking down new  niches all the time inside of digital landlords, Aaron. And there's always new stuff that's coming  up that works. So keep going. A hundred percent last comment. This isn't really a question,  but a comment that we can probably wrap it up. But I said, please do a call on getting clients.  So it sounds like really the sales process, specifically the sales call.  Yeah. A hundred percent. That would be that we do. We have a training on that. It's about  four hours worth of training. So it's like, that's, that's, that is the whole problem. That is the,  that is the most important part. And I'm only saying this because a lot of people think  it's two things, picking the right city and niche and getting the client,  all the stuff in between is easy. Get building a website, ranking it on Google, all the stuff that  you think I need to get tech. Dude, that stuff's easy. Aaron, can you back me up on this? Like  that's the stuff. There's a thousand trainings on how to rank a website. Pick a good city and you  don't even have to be that good. That's, that's the truth. You like, that's literally the game,  right? Like you want to go and like make money on a house, go find the house that's completely  marked way under it's undervalued and go sell it for the value. So the value it's actually  worth, that's the easiest way to make money. Like, so if you can pick, figure out a pick a  city and niche properly, and you know, the sales process, that's the whole game. But to let you  know at the sales process is not just call client there. It's very systematic. There's things you  need to say. There's people you need to target. There's strategy behind it. There's certain ways  to pass over the leads. There's scripts that, yeah, you don't have to know it. You can, you  could stumble your way to a deal, but that's why I do what I do. That's why we, we built what we  built. And so we'll get to that, but it's probably going to be in like Q3 of next year, or maybe it's  Q1 of next year. I don't",

I,  is Ed in Digital Landlords? I'm trying to remember. He's not. I definitely know he's not in the  Facebook group. I'm just giving you a hard time, bro. I love your questions. They're, they're,  they're great questions. They're all the questions you should be asking. It's why I'm curious. So  is there anything else? Maybe we could do one or two more. Yeah. So Ed also does say,  have you done revenue share? No. Why would I do revenue share? So I can, so that there's like,  if I could do flat fee, why would I do revenue share? Yeah. It seems like with revenue share,  like the only way it works is if you have like a super quality business owner who's good at their  job and there's also honest. And the only problem with that is it's not a way to scale because you  can't learn that until you've worked with them for a while. The only time I'm doing revenue share is  if it's a family member or a friend that I'm doing it as a favor or as a bigger move. That's  the only way I'd never do revenue share. I'll never do commission and I'll never do paper lead  again because why, why, why, if it takes five extra seconds, then why I want, if you guys,  by the way, follow me on Instagram. Lately, I've been showing my Stripe account. I just did today.  I love waking up and seeing at five 35 this morning. I made 150 bucks. It's not a lot,  but you know what? I made 150 bucks while I was on sleepy time. That's sexy to me. I love that. I  don't care if it's $5. I didn't have to work for that. It was done. It was time. Just do one more  more. Yeah. Awesome. I think I'm looking through these. I think that is actually it. I hope I'm  not missing a comment. We did it, dude. We did it. Beautiful. That was good. That was beautiful.  Okay. So what we're going to do guys, thank you guys for being on the call. Once again, Aaron,  real quick, go ahead and drop that link one more time for digital landlords. I have no shame in  doing that only because I, I want you guys to understand this is just like with your business  owners. If you're going to give them free leads, the reason you're doing, you're giving them free  leads is to ultimately lead them to working with you. I'm, I'm on this call because I want to work  with you guys. Like I'm not here to pretend that like this is some kind of like volunteer service.  I make money. I like money. You should too. We can all make money and that's great. I am giving you  this live training because I want to earn your business and you might have to get on a couple  of these before you realize, Hey, I'm just, I'm just kicking the can down the road. But for those  of you that value your time, like I did, or they're in a situation that need to get going,  get serious about life and freaking start making some money and realize that like you can wake up  tomorrow and get hit by a freaking bus and your family's not taken care of and you need to leave  them assets. There you go. So Aaron, drop that one more time. Everyone that was on this call,",

And the last thing I want to say is I wrap this up guys,  look at what I'm doing on this call and do it for your clients. Go and give the business owners,  you're trying to earn their business so much value. Guys, I guarantee that you could go,  like what I gave you today is 10 times better than what you're going to get from a Udemy course that  you would have spent 50 bucks on or a hundred bucks on or what, I don't even know what it is.  I don't, I've never bought any of that stuff. I promise you the experience I have and the value  I gave you and including this digital resource, you got more value than you would have from paid  stuff.

    "pageContent": " Hey, guys, we're going to show this this video clip is going to kind of highlight something that's going to happen after you set up your first Google search campaign. And it'll probably happen a few days after it goes live, possibly up to a week later. And you're going to see these optimization scores. You want to have I like to have my optimization scores like above 95% as much as possible. So for anyone that's been around in the group for a while, we we started with smart campaigns, because  it was literally like you set it up and you forget it. And you just it's very light maintenance on it. As those became more and more maintenance heavy, talking to Nick and other people in the group, we said, you know, let's just make the change to these search campaigns. That's why we're doing that. And the reason why we avoided it in the very beginning was because there's a lot of maintenance that goes into them. We didn't have to deal with that with certain with the smart campaigns. But now we're in a new world. And that's what we're doing. So one of the things you're going to see is you're going to see these recommendations. And you're going to think, Oh, my God,  gosh, I'm getting punished or penalized or whatever. And you're not. The big thing you got to think about here is that Google is an advertising company, and they want their money. Okay. And for the lead gen stuff and the services that we're involved in doing, we don't really need all of these things. Okay. We can do some maybe advanced training later to go over some of these. But for the most part, what you do is you come into your ad, you go down to recommendations, and it'll tell you what your optimization score is. And then what it's going to do, it's going to tell you all these things. It's  going to tell you add broad match keywords. We don't want broad match keywords. So what I do is you go to see the three dots right here, we click that I go to dismiss all. Okay. And then at dismiss all, I either put I will do it later. I do not think this will improve my performance. It doesn't matter. And then I hit dismiss all and I want you to watch my optimization score increase. Boom, it just jumped 8%. Okay. So again, Google, what Google is asking is Google is trying to get you to do certain things. I'm not saying that they're all  bad. But a lot of it is trying to get more money and wasteful ad spend. So that's why we're that's why we're showing you this. So you know, so you're not enticed to click this and add it and do that. And then you're going to be wondering why your ads blowing all this money and everything else. So here's another one for site links. Okay, you don't need site links when you start it there. There is a benefit to them. I will we will do another video later once everyone kind of gets on board with this. But same thing I hit the three thought three, three  dots. And then I'm going to put I will do it later. And I hit dismiss all. And boom, now I'm up in 95 and a half. Right? customer match list. This isn't a business that has a bunch of emails and customer data. I don't need it. So I to go up here, or I can put this is not relevant. Okay. And then it's going to want to sometimes they do offer you good keywords. Sometimes they don't. So it's up to you. You can take a look at them and analyze them. And if there's something that you're missing, or you",

But for the purposes of this video, I'm just going to dismiss it. Okay, and then these other ones are just other stuff, but they don't have any score on my optimization. And just like that, my optimization score went from 83 to 99.9. And it's as simple as that. So we just wanted to show you that video. So you guys understand it, because this is going to happen, you're going to open it up, you're gonna be like, I'm at a 77. Oh, my gosh. And Google's telling me to do all these things.

    "pageContent": " OK, Ariel says, why do you not touch the ones that have CPC as NA?  So the reason why, real quick on that, Ariel,  is because typically with CPC, think about it, right?  Supply and demand.  So if the cost per click is zero, that  means there's nobody else bidding on it, right?  There's no marketers, there's no business owners,  there's no one else that's wanting to pay for those ads.  Which I can therefore infer that it's worth nothing, right?  So for example, you're going to have a keyword like cheap concrete  companies in Newport, whatever, right?  That CPC is zero.  Why?  Because no one cares about it.  So if you want to go like those CPCs, the reason why  is because it's typically a waste of time, right?  There's no volume.  It says there's volume, but it's not worth anything.  So if you want to go test it out, cool.  And there's probably a couple situations  where, yeah, it's going to work.  But I'm just using my intuition of saying, OK, there's CPC that's  zero, which means nobody cares enough to pay for it,  which means there's one of many things, right?  There's too much supply and not enough demand or vice versa.  So that's why.  Hope that makes sense.",

    "pageContent": " What about when the client says for us it's all about conversion and to win the and then they through that  Let's see what happens with the free leads you sent us. That's a great question  I've covered this and I'm gonna cover this again. So one I've had this happen. I had this happen recently  In fact, I'll tag you in a video one. There's a video that I'm gonna share with you. So client says  They say hey, let's see what happens these leads. Okay, I did a  Specific lie for this thing was on a Friday two Fridays ago. So here's what I say is I say hey look mr. Business owner  If I sent you let's so let's say you've sent in three leads  I say hey if those three leads that I sent you if you close all three of those  Is it safe to assume you're gonna close a hundred percent of them?  Well, no, of course not. Okay. Well if you close zero of those three leads  Is it safe to assume that you're gonna close zero leads? Well, no  Okay, so the reason I'm bringing that up because  We can't base this off of three leads unless you're a hundred percent closer basing us off of three leads is the most  Short-sighted move we could ever make in the world  because and I say that say I work I've worked with some people in the past where I sent them ten leads they've closed zero and  Then the next ten leads they closed seven out of ten and they average almost 40% close rate  So I'm not sending you like that. I hope you didn't misunderstand me. Mr. Business owner  I'm not sending you guys this just so you could like and so I'm not gonna keep sending you leads for you to close the  Deal I'm sending you these leads so you can see the quality of the lead knowing that it is a numbers game  Okay, so I just don't want you to get confused. I'm sending you a couple whether you close them or not  That's on you. You don't have to pay me. Those are free. That's on you  But we need to talk in three days something like that because guys it's ridiculous  Like think about that think about like and I'm glad you brought this up dude  Like the people like what kind of balls these people have hey, thanks for the free  Like think about this. Hey guys  Hey one appreciate the free leads  Let me see if I make any money from those free leads to add further value to what you've already given me for free and  Then and only then will we talk then and only then will we do business on screw that person  Okay, so to me what that that might be like if you're getting that a lot and some people just have that in their mind  If you're getting that a lot, that's probably something that you're you're doing in the call  That first call where you need to kind of you need to do that pullback  You need to do what we talked about today with like this is a perfect example from today  Hey, like in your own way, you need to let them know that this this is not this isn't contingent upon them closing leads period  I'm sending you the leads so you can test them out  But this is a numbers game and I send you 20 leads  Okay, how many how many you how many free leads you want? Right? You're in business. I don't run a non-profit neither do you?  I'm gonna send you a couple  I'm happy to send you a couple more but we can't wait like if that's the game you're playing this isn't gonna work like  Be bold know your worth like that person right there if they say oh, well then this",

You have the business, the customer's name.  You know the scope of work.  So I think it's more effective,  but have I gotten deals where we've done that?

I think there's a big difference and I don't want you to get to get confused if I'm doing a homework on a city.  And I see a lead generation site. Okay. And the city still looks wide open, I don't see any ads, whatever or I don't see any ads from the lead generator. To me that's just another competitor.  Okay, I don't think that market saturated whatever.  Now, if I go in and I'm looking at Las Vegas concrete and I see that somebody literally has a landing page that looks just like ours they have ads that the same ad copy.  I may want to just consider going on to the next city. Okay.  Now, you could also reach out to that person and say hey what do you think about doing a deal together. So there's, there's different ways you can look at it but for me.  I mean, I probably would not.  If it's somebody from this group I probably would not. Okay, just my two cents. There's too many cities, there's too many niches.

There are a couple pieces of questions or a couple pieces of information that there's  a time and a place, and I want to go over those really briefly.  I've already talked about this, so I don't want to take too much time, but there's two  things.  As you start doing this live transfer process and you're calling them in between, you're  texting them in between, you're starting to build this relationship, they're going to  get comfortable with you and they're going to go...  Some of these guys are going to say, some of these ladies are going to say, hey, tell  me how much is this going to cost?  Just shoot me straight, man.  I'm a no BS kind of guy.  I'm a no BS kind of lady, and they're going to ask you, how does this work?  There are two things that you want to push off.  Number one is price and number two is deal structure because they're the two things that  can scare people.  I do not share either of those until the proper time.  I don't share the price until the final call.  I don't share the deal structure until the screencast, which is going to be in the next  module.  If these keep coming up, just keep letting them know, hey, I don't want to put the cart  before the horse.  We'll deal with that later.  Let me just get you a couple more leads and we can talk about it, but I'm very flexible.  Just so you know, I'm really creative.  I own this company.  It's on me.  I get to decide.  That's my go-to.  Nice.  I've mentioned this before, but if somebody keeps hitting you on price, price, price,  price, price, and it gets to the point where it's like, they're going to need no price,  just say, hey, just to be honest with you, Mr. Business Owner, Mr. Business Owner, I  have customers that are paying me three to 500 bucks a month and I have somebody that's  paying me 20, 30K a month.  It's going to be somewhere in between.  Ha, ha, ha.  No, but seriously, obviously it'll be way closer to the bottom than the top, but it's  a huge range.  There's a lot of factors.  I don't want to get too deep into that until we found out that this is actually a good  fit.  Okay?  This is something to satisfy them and move on.  That's it.  That's what I say if they keep hitting me on price.  Those two things, the deal structure, and this is something you're going to get a lot  as people are going to keep saying, and they're going to be trying to hedge their bet.  They're going to go, yeah, man, this is cool.  I'm just going to raise my prices and I'm going to give you 10% or, hey, this is going  to work out really well.  I'm just going to give you a percentage.  It's going to start to get to your head because you're going to think, man, how am I ever  going to sell this person on a flat fee deal?  Don't let it get to your head.  Don't get flustered.  Don't stop and go, hey, man.  I actually don't do commission.  Hey, man.  I don't do paper lead.  I only do flat fee.  You're going to",

Don't get flustered.  Just realize what they're trying to do is they're trying to let you know that, hey,  They're comfortable paying a commission, but they don't want to do anything else.  But the thing is they don't understand.  They don't understand why paper lead actually sucks for them.  They don't understand why commission.  There's no incentive for either of you, but there's a time and a place.  I just wanted to mention once again, do not drop price too early.  Do not drop deal structure too early or you're going to kill the deal.  And I want to mention it here because as you start doing these live transfers, you're going  to have a lot of communication with the business owner and they're going to start asking questions.

    "pageContent": " The question is, should you keep adding content and how often should you keep adding content?  We are not Google so we can't give you like a specific answer on what is, you know, the  perfect thing that you can do when you are building your website and when it comes down  to content.  But we can tell you what we are doing that has been working for us.  So usually if this is the first website that you are building, you put on the content,  you are doing all the on-pages here, you are setting this up, don't touch it for a couple  of months and then in a couple of months, two, three, four months, do the ranking, see  how your website is doing and then you can add content.  But I would not keep editing, I would not keep touching, just let it do its course,  keep getting other deals, focus on other things and just kind of focus on other things, don't  keep adding or editing because Google is crawling your website, is ranking your website  and so you don't want to mess too much with it.  So I would say wait a couple of months, do the rankings after that, see how your website  is doing.  If it's not doing great, if it's still on page five, six, seven and you are not seeing  it, you know, getting better, then add some content.  And I would start with adding 500 words per page every week.  Do that and then after a month, do the rankings again and see if, and I mean, it doesn't have  to be page one, number one, but it should be progressively getting better.  And again, it's not just about content, you are also going to have to do other things  to rank it if it's not ranking, but content will be something major for your website and  so that's something that you want to do.  You want to be checking it and adding if needed.  If your website is ranking, do not touch it.  That is one of the main rules that we have.  If your website is on page one and it's ranking really well, it's getting leads.  Don't think, oh, well, what can it, how much more better it could be doing if I added more  content, if I touch it up or well, it's kind of ugly.  I don't really like the content I'm going to edit.  Don't touch it.  If it's ranking, if it's producing, don't touch it.  Just leave it because it's working.  It has been working and there's no need for you to touch it or mess with it.  So leave it.  You only go on and add content, edit content if it's not ranking or producing.  And that's it for content.",

    "pageContent": " I had someone reach out through referral and they recommended a city for me.  I got them three leads in four days. They charge high prices and are proud of it.  I got on a call with them both to close and they liked everything until it came to talking about  price. One business owner said 1500 per month is fair but they have to think about it for two weeks.  I wasn't able to use the method where I said I have someone on the hook. I tried to tell them  I'll need to look for another business owner while they consider and they said that's fine.  What could I have done differently there to have gotten them to make the decision on the phone?  So basically, long story short, he wasn't able to close the deal on the spot.  The one business owner said that the 1500 was fine but they need two weeks to think about it.  Just a reminder, whenever you guys are getting objections, this is going back to sales 101,  whether you're selling freaking ridiculously priced bottled water, shout out to Park Plaza  for using glass when they don't need to, that's fine. High priced bottled water, t-shirts,  freaking power banks, it doesn't matter what you're selling. If you are getting an objection  from your customer, it's almost 100% of the time not what you did. It's not where the objection  came that you went wrong. It's the step or a step before. Now, without getting all the context and  without being there as a fly on the wall, without watching over your shoulder, without knowing  exactly what was said and the timeline and all the rest, what I can tell you is that I believe,  based on what you're telling me, that what happened is the setup, which is right before  the close. The setup is where it went wrong. What I mean by that is that the business owner clearly  felt like they could come to you and say they needed time to think about it. We don't get that.  I don't get that. Our agency doesn't get that. We just don't. The reason why is because I know  it's coming. Every person on this earth, every human on this earth is going to say they need  to think about it because no one wants to make the wrong decision. I already know that's coming.  As part of the training, what we talked about is the setup. As part of the setup, we want to  eliminate objections. We don't want to wait for them. This is a prime example. When you  wait for an objection to come, now you have to overcome it. When you attack the objection first,  when you eliminate the objection first, it's so much easier. It takes one sentence. It takes one  quick conversation. It takes one example, and it's not an issue. If you wait for the objection to  come, it is almost impossible or extremely difficult to overcome. It is extremely hard  to tell someone they can't think about it versus telling someone, hey, all I ask is that by the end  of this call, you give me a yes or no. If it's a maybe, it's a no. That is so much easier to do.  Than to wait until they object. I can tell you based on what you're telling me that you went  wrong in the setup. You went wrong in not setting the expectations, not being clear that I need an  answer on this. You don't need to say it like that. Hey, I need you to give me a yes or no. We don't  want to spook them. Sometimes I'll say that if the business owner and me were vibing and whatever,  you went wrong in the setup. That needs to be addressed. You need to either say that",

    "pageContent": "on the  phone. What I like to bring, I like to definitely bring it up in the screencast, but I also like to  bring it up on the phone call. I'm talking to these business owners. If I'm the one that's still  closing deals, which I've removed myself from that aspect, thank goodness, I did that for years.  I say thank goodness not because I don't like it. I love it. I say thank goodness because it's  allowed me to scale now because I don't have to be there and get deals. You went wrong in the setup.  You needed to bring that up in the screencast that you were going to need a decision because  you need to find someone as soon as possible. These leads are valuable. It's money going down  the drain. I'm going to give you some for free, but you need to let me know by the end of this.  That's all I ask. Don't leave me in the whole no man's land or are you going to think about it,  that kind of thing. That's all I ask from you, Mr. Business Owner. By the way, make sure that you  have decision makers on the phone. There's no pressure. I've given you the leads. I'm going  to show you the pricing. I'm going to go over everything. You're going to have every bit of  information. That's it. You went wrong in the setup. Now, one more thing. If you do get that  objection, I want to cover this really quick. Let's say you to get the objection of, I want  to think about it. I need to think about it, whatever. Now, your only option is to try and  overcome the objection. Again, just remember, and I think we even have this in fact almost,  and I know we do, inside of the premium sales training library, which if you don't have access  to it, that is the library that's for those students that are paid in full. There were some  of you guys that before we started doing the funding and everything else, we're on payment  plans when we used to do those internally. If you are not already, make sure you get yourself paid  in full so you can have access to the premium sales training library. If you are paid in full,  message Fix It Felix to get access to all that material. But in there, we have a training on  Feel Felt Found. We want to make sure, just a quick recap, make sure that you let the business  owner know that you feel them. Hey, I feel you. I understand. You don't want to make a wrong  decision, whatever, right? Felt, you want to make sure that you let them know that another business  owner felt the exact same way. You can say, I felt the same way when doing such and such a thing,  but it's more powerful if you say, you know, remember that guy Joe I told you about that  we work with in Cincinnati? Yeah, it's funny you say that. He felt the exact same way. He's like,  dude, I got to think about it. Feel, then felt, and then it comes to found. But what Joe found is  that at the end of the day, he would rather, even though he wasn't 100% certain, he's like,  I can't be 100% certain about anything. He would rather take that slight risk than me go with  somebody else and work with somebody else because I've given him the free leads. He's already looking  to do something different from what he's already doing. He needed to grow and it just made sense.  So that's the feel felt found. And then you go in for the close",

    "pageContent": "again. Okay.  The only other thing I would mention before you do that, I skipped a step, make sure that you  make sure that that is their actual objection. Okay, you need to tie them down. Okay, Bob,  I get it. So you want to think about it, right? So besides thinking about it,  and I'm doing air quotes, because that's a broad thing. Besides you thinking about it.  Is there any other thing, any other question, any other reason that this wouldn't make sense  today? No. Okay. Now I'm going to go a little deeper. Let me ask you this, Bob. And again,  I'm not going to be pushy. I just want to understand what exactly do you need to think about?  Because I know that you know where your budget's at, right? You run the business,  you know where the budget's at. I know that your partners are on the phone. What exactly  when you say you want to think about what exactly do you mean? And they're going to tell you,  right? And you're going to dig and you're going to dig and you're going to make sure and you're  going to isolate that one specific issue and make sure that's the actual cause. Then you're  going to use the feel felt found method. And then you're going to go back in for the close. Okay.  Tie down the objection, feel felt found, go back for the close. And you don't need to be super  aggressive. You could do it in your own way. You don't need to just be super blunt. I like to be  that way sometimes. Sometimes I don't. It just depends on the situation, but you can do it the  way that you want to do it. But again, think about it. The setup, you could have easily just  told them that on the call, right? On the screencast. That would have just been simple.  A line, a sentence, two sentences versus you didn't and now you're at objection  overcoming and now you have to tie it down and now you have to do the feel felt found.  And now you have to go back in for the close and it's a little bit uncomfortable and you're  going to sweat a little bit and you're going to, it's so much easier to eliminate than it  is to overcome. Sorry, that was a long answer, but that's the truth. Okay.",

It's not that much money  Even if you put 10 of you know, 150 bucks, it's not much. I do stock. I do pexels.com. I do Pixlr  Just some of these free image sources, right?  It's and I know it kind of gets hard if you're doing the same niche like oh my heck  I'm doing more concrete photos. One thing that I've noticed too that I've done is if you get a client that's in your backyard  Go and go and send one of your people or you yourself take a camera  Take your iPhone go and take a bunch of photos go to one of their job sites and go get a bunch of photos  now you have to be a little bit careful because if you live in a climate that's like  Different like for example, I live somewhere.

But I'm not gonna be able to use those photos to  Market in Montana because the houses the trees the landscape it's all gonna be different, but I will go to job sites  I've sent my team to multiple job sites to go and take photos and that gives me a bunch of photos  I can use not just on that project, but on future projects in the same niche.

    "pageContent": " Bruce says, Jeff, in the beginning, you mentioned just using your ad account for the first 10 or 15 campaigns before using an MCC.  So my question is, I already have an ad account set up under my name. It is season three plus years. I use it for affiliate marketing so it is not an MCC account.  Would you suggest that I just go ahead with that account for now and transition over to an MCC account down the road?  That's the first question.  So if all of your ads, if you go and you click your icon in the top and you see all of your ads, your Google ads that drop down from that, if you can manage them from there, I would just say I wouldn't mess with it.  But if you, for whatever reason, if you want to create the hierarchy of an MCC, and then moving them all in there, you can, but what might happen is that because all of those got set up under that one, you might have some issues like setting them up separately.  So you can set that up, you can set up an MCC, you can add an account, you should be able to migrate each of those individual ad numbers and bring them in.  Is it necessary? No.  So if you're going to start growing, you want to do it? Yes, you can. What I would say is I would start a different account as an MCC account and bring those over because then it actually creates a legit hierarchy.  That's, you know, Jeff 123 versus my old one, which is Jeff 456. Does that make sense?  Then his second part, I think you just answered. Secondly, when it is time to transition, should I open a new account under my agency name and set up the MCC account there, by the way, thanks for what you do.  Yes, if you're, so you're not that it's necessary, but if you have like an account, like a, like a domain, you register with Google and you're doing like a, you know, domain match email type of thing, then that's the one you want to set up.  And there's a verification process to go through. And, but that's when you're like, you're running a legit business, like you've made enough money to start doing that. So if you're going to do it, that's how I would do it.  Your second part is that's what I would do and suggest, but it's not necessary for what we're doing. It's just like when you start getting the next level, that's why I said 15 or 20. When you start getting beyond that, it's, it's, it is a pain in the ass. I get it.  But yeah, to drop. Yeah, for sure.",

Six businesses, I'd still go for it.  I mean, if you are, it shouldn't,  I mean, look, I've gone into cities  that there's been three or two and I've gotten deals.  What we have to remember guys,  is it is still possible to close people  that aren't currently paying for ads or leads.  That's still a thing, right?  Like I feel like before I started talking about it,  people weren't even looking at that shit.  It was just like, we're just going into whatever.  So yes, you can close people that aren't paying.  It's just easier when they're paying for Google ads.  And then it's easier after that paying for people  that are paying, finding people that are paying  for home advisor and then Angie's leads.  And then it goes down, boom, boom, boom, boom.  So at six people paying for it, yeah, bro, send it.  No big deal, just send that thing, dude.  Gotta get in those reps.  And I'm guessing if there's not anyone paying for ads  or only six people, then maybe your CPC is really low.  And if nothing else, you get your reps in, okay?",

So do you also build out the site if they sign a three-month contract as well, or do you wait until so?  That's a good question, Bruce.  I always build the site as soon as they sign the contract.  Even if it's a three-month deal, I build it out unless it's a new niche, unless it's a niche that I've never done before.  If it's like an excavation niche where I've never done it, I'm not building that site out until I've gone through one client.  They've gone through the three or six months, they re-sign, then I'm going to build it out.  But I don't know if that niche is going to hit, but if it's like a concrete niche or something like that, yeah, even a three month, I'm building that shit.  I'm going to use the business owner's money to build it, and I'm going to build it right.",

    "pageContent": " Okay. So guys, welcome to the call officially. I had a few announcements a second ago, but  welcome to the actual call. We got Porter on the call today. I know you guys have probably  seen him quite a bit lately and that's because he's been having a lot of success and also  because when somebody, you know, gets on these lives and is posting in the group, it forces  them to also have success. So it's a win-win situation. But what I want to talk about today  and why I wanted to bring Porter on is because I want to talk about Porter's path to 10K a month  and also remind you guys that this is while he's been taking over the family farm. And also I  didn't mention this because it would have made the title too long, but also while they just had their  first child, was it back in October, Porter? Yeah, October. October what? October 4th.  October 4th. So for the last two, let's see, October, November, December. So the past three  and a half months, Porter's also, you know, had the stress, obviously the excitement, but the stress  and the non-sleeping and the emotional wife and all that kind of stuff that comes with having a  child. So for those of you that are like, I'm too busy. I've got a ton of stuff going on. We are  all too busy. We all got a bunch of stuff going on. And I want to show you guys that even despite  that, that you can, you can go and get 10K. You can go and everybody should expect to be at 10K.  Okay. That's just the, that should be just the expectation, not to get your first deal, not to  get your second deal, but to get to 10K. And then from 10K, you can move up from there, but there's  no reason why you can't go and carve out a couple of deals. Porter, of your 10K, how many  deals is that? Is that 10 deals? Is it eight deals? Is it 12 deals? How many, how many business owners  are you working with or how many websites is the 10K spread amongst? I want to say it's seven  clients and eight websites. Beautiful. So one of your sites, one of your clients, you double dip,  got a two for one, the old two for, and then the rest of them are just a little bit over a thousand  a month. Yeah. Basically. Okay. Amazing. So Porter, when did you, so I've got, I've got a list of nine  questions that I want to ask you. I don't want to hog all of it with, with my questions. I want you  guys to be able to ask questions. I also want to let everybody know upfront that I know because  Porter's my brother, it's probably easy to be, to think that I've helped him with a deal. It's  probably easy to think that I jumped on a call with him to close a business owner, that I referred  him a business owner. Porter, between you and God, have I ever jumped on a sales call? No, not one.  Have I ever given you a client? No, not one. None. Have I ever, do, have I, do I even,  when's the last time you and I even talked on the phone? I don't even remember actually. Yeah. Yeah,  it's been a minute. Now, obviously, if I see Porter, you know, family gatherings,  dinners, stuff like that, and he asked a question, I'm going to answer. But if you guys, for one  second, think",

In fact, sometimes he probably gets less than anyone else  because I don't want it to seem like that. So I want to just set the record straight. Porter has  done this completely on his own, watching the training, asking questions. I've of course,  answered a few of his questions, but it's not like I just answer. He called me every five seconds.  So let's get into these questions. But I want you guys all to know that if you have questions for  Porter, I want you to be able to ask them. And let's just talk about his path to 10K, how he  did it, raw facts. I will let you guys know he almost hit it. Then he dropped back. Then he  almost got there. Then he lost three deals. It was quite a thing. So Porter, my first question  I have for you, dude, is what took you so long to get to 10K, bro?  I think that that's the, that's the golden question.  So hold on. Let's, let's, let's be completely honest. So you, I, I tried to get Porter to do this  years ago, like, yeah, whatever. And I was like, Porter, you should jump in. You check this out.  I'm making money, whatever. And I think in the beginning it was interesting, but you didn't  do anything. So when did you officially start, like actually went through the training?  So that was, I want to say that was like two, two years ago that I actually went,  went through everything. Like two years ago or last two and a half years.  It was November of, yeah, November of 22 years ago. 22. So just over two years ago.  Yes. So just over two years ago, that's when I got my first deal. So that was right when I got  married. So like, I was like, okay, I got to make some money here. Cause I'm not making enough from  just doing the farm. And so I got the one deal and I was so like excited. Like I remember you get your  first deal. And I just was like, I was like, this is crazy that I got this deal. So I really went  all in at that point, but I still had some, like, I was still nervous because I didn't quite  understand like how emotional it was like to lose a client. And so like, I went to this phase  where I went balls to the wall for like three or four months until farming season. And I almost  got to 10 K within that short amount of time, I got to like 9,000 or something. And I just didn't  know how to keep a client. I didn't know that they needed to be closing jobs. I just thought,  Hey, I'm providing the elites. They're not closing the jobs. And I still was like, I was losing  clients pretty fast. I lost, I lost four clients in two weeks. I was, I was devastated  because all my income was gone. So I remember Thanksgiving 2022, our whole family, we went to  Scottsdale and in Arizona. And I remember you and I did a live there. And I think even by that time,  you had already landed a couple deals because I wouldn't have brought you on live if you hadn't.  So you had already gotten some momentum and then you really, really did well. And I remember what  ended up happening is it was right before I came to Africa, 2023, you were getting really close to  10",

    "pageContent": "K. You were like around nine. Was it nine or 87? Like you were close, right? Yeah, it was really  close. And then you lost four deals in two weeks. What month was that? That was in, it was right  before I started farming. So it would have been like March, March, April. Okay, great. So how'd  you lose four deals in two weeks? What did you learn? How did you lose them? What did you learn?  How can people avoid that? And by the way, this happens. And, you know, I was talking to Drew  yesterday. We were laughing about it. Like we call it the December slaughter, right? If you're not  prepared, if you don't have contracts in place, you don't have business owners that are happy,  if you've sat and rested on your laurels, you can really get smoked. I got hit hard for two  December's in a row. And I said, never, ever, ever again. And thank goodness it hasn't happened  like that again. But yours didn't happen in December. So how did you lose four clients in  two weeks? Did you send them anthrax in the mail, dude? I mean, how do you, that's impressive.  I don't even know. So one of them, it was the craziest thing. One guy just like, he stopped  paying me. And so I reached out to him. He blocked my number on like everything. Like couldn't find  him on social media. Just completely just off the grid. Yep. The next guy, I don't even know. He  just stopped, he stopped paying like one of his charge card. And I was kind of, it was kind of  my fault. I think I kind of was being like, well, I charged his card, but it declined.  Okay. And then you said he had a charge card. I was like, well, that's your sign, dude. You may  as well take it. No, well, yeah. Well, it was just weird, like the whole situation. So he's like,  hey, charge this card this week, charge this card next week. And then I charged the wrong  card one week and he was like, Hey, I told you how to charge it. I'm like, dude, I need a card  that I can just leave on file. Anyways, it didn't work out. And then I, one of the cards declined  and I was kind of like, dude, I need some payment or like, I gotta move on. Cause he wasn't responding  to me. Anyways, we kind of left on a bad note and anyways, lost that client. So a lot of them were  the fact that they weren't making money though. What I didn't realize was that I have to supply  the leads, but I also have to make sure that they kind of know what they're doing and how to handle  these leads because if they don't make money, they're going to drop me. And that's exactly  what a lot of them did. They were getting plenty of leads, but they were answering the phone call  wrong. They were maybe just not as bubbly on the phone with these customers and they just weren't  closing a percentage that would allow them to keep doing what we're doing together. So  what I've learned is even through this winter is just like, you got to start doing more weekly  contact monthly con on a zoom call. Like just always be checking in on them. And it's funny  that the clients that I want, the clients that are easy to deal with, I never talk to them.  Like it's weird because you think you need to have this like tab on them all the time,",

    "pageContent": "but it's the  ones that are like, so they almost get annoyed for me reaching out. Those are the ones that you want  to work with. Yeah. I've said that a handful of times for those of you that have been in this  group from the beginning, if a client does not make money, they will cancel. I don't care how  many leads you're giving them. I don't care how good the leads are. I don't care how closeable  those leads are. I don't care how much they should have closed those leads. At the end of the day,  if a client, if a business owner does not make money, they will cancel, whether it's today,  whether it's next month, whether it's next year, they will cancel it. And unfortunately,  it's not your fault, but it is your business. So it's not your fault that they're not closing,  but you do need to make it your business that they close deals if you want to retain the client.  And so some of us, we get these clients where everything works out. We send them a decent  amount of leads. They're good at closing. It's so easy. We're like, why can't we find more  clients like them? But what you're not realizing is that because they're making money,  it's eliminating 99% of the problems and the issues and the customer service stuff and the  touch ins. And guys, when a client's making money, most of the problems go away. I heard  this quote by Grant Cardone years ago. He said, if you want to keep a client for life, make them  money. If you want to keep a client for money for life, make them money. And I deal with the same  thing in this group, right? Same training that Porter used to get to 10K. I have somebody who  comes in, doesn't do anything, makes no money. And they want to blame me. They want to talk badly  about me. They want to blame the program and it doesn't work and this and that. And it's like,  dude, this is the exact same, literally the exact same training that this person, Ryan Dalton's at  $87,000 a month. And this person's complaining that my stuff doesn't work. How does that work?  Well, this person didn't make money. And unfortunately, it's not my fault,  but it is my business. And so that's one of the reasons why with this new 3.0 training,  which by the way, will be out before the end of Q1 for anyone that's going to ask,  my focus is on how I can hold people's hand to that first deal and make it my business, because  that's just the fact of the matter is they are. And in this case, obviously it's not like you  can cancel because it's not a recurring payment, but you can not give me a good review or not  recommend me to people, which is the same as canceling with a business owner. So number one,  guys, is you do need to make it your business. Business owners have to be making money.  We all have these business owners where they just, you talk to them on the phone.  It doesn't seem quite right. You're like, dude, that guy's never going to close a deal.  They have a scattered operation and we're like, well, let me just close the deal so I can post  it in the group. And we've all, the reporter, you've closed some of these deals, right?  That you're like, I'm just going to get the deal. No upfront, it feels good, but long term,  it's not the move, man. Now",

    "pageContent": "you just locked your area up for six months and that's only,  it's only going to last two months or three months or six months in one day.  And you're going to be back to the drawing board. And so sometimes as you, as you  mature in business, you start to realize that just because you, this is a line that I really like is  just because you can take money or just because there is money on the table, doesn't mean you  should take it, right? Not all money is equal. Not all money is good. Yes, it spends the same,  but there's money that comes with a lot more hassle and a lot more headache and a lot more pain.  It's not worth it. And so that's number one. Number two, really quick is I was talking to  Drew about this because he had his December, he had a few clients come in and he was like,  he had a few clients canceled as well. And guys, what you need to understand is that business,  what's this business specifically, what you're, what a million dollar a year company looks like  is it looks like a bunch of clients that have like been with you from years back.  So I'll give you an example. In 2020, sorry, in 2019, we signed a client. That was my first flat  fee deal ever. Right. That client was a great client. That person was low maintenance and they  ended up staying with me up until like last year. And then they ended up doing their own website,  whatever, whatever, whatever. Okay. But then in 2020, we went and signed all these new clients  because that's when we scaled up to six figures a month. And of those, I don't even know exactly  how many clients, but let's say there was, you know, 60 clients that made up a hundred thousand  a month, or let's say there was 50. I know there was more than that because obviously  they weren't all 2000 a month, but let's just make it, or let's say there was a hundred,  just to make easy math out of those, let's say a hundred clients. The next two years later,  so that was 2020, let's say by 2022 of that original hundred clients that made up my  million dollar a year company, there's probably, there probably was only 25 or 30 of those clients  that were still with me two years later. And what I had to do in year 23, in 2021 and 2022  is I was going and finding tenants or clients that were good fits, right?  Imagine you had a hundred homes, you had to get all of them rented out. You're not going to go  find a hundred amazing tenants that pay their bills on time, that have good credit score,  that are going to keep the house clean, that aren't going to let their dogs pee all over the place,  that aren't going to have sound and parties on Friday nights.  What's going to happen is you're going to go and get a hundred of these houses filled  and 25 of those are going to be the amazing clients that are going to be with you for the  next 10 years. And guess what you're going to have to do with the next 75? You're going to have to go  and you're going to have to go and replace all of those people with the next batch.  And then maybe of those, another 30 stick. And now you've got 50, 55,  really solid clients. Those 10 year, 15 year, they don't even want to buy a house.  They're super happy to pay you rent as long as you treat them",

    "pageContent": "good.  And what happens is over the years, guys, you start to build up this base of clients brick by brick  of very, very low maintenance clients that once you get to where I'm in, I've legitimately been  doing this seriously since end of 2019, beginning of 2020. So now I'm four years, five years into  this. Now I finally have those clients where you guys hear me talking about, yeah, I haven't talked  to that client in two years personally. Yeah. Francesca reached out because his wife got a  surgery. But other than that, we haven't talked to him. So just so you guys understand when you  lose clients, it is part of the game. Think about it when you get tenants. Yeah, they needed a  place to stay, but you're not going to go pick a hundred good tenants right out the gate.  And so that is just the nature of this business. There's going to be turnover,  but understand as you grow, take good care of the ones of all of them, of course, but especially  at the ones that are low maintenance, those are going to be your lifers. Those are going to be  the people like I literally have clients still from 2020. Four years later, it paid me a hundred  and thirty thousand dollars a month in my Stripe account, and they require nothing from me. The  only thing they want to do is they want to talk on the phone. How can we expand? You guys know  my Bentonville concrete project. I always talk about that guy's name is Brooks 2020. We signed  the deal. He has never canceled, and he messaged us like twice this year. He's like,  let's get on a Zoom. Let's see how we can expand. And he's like, well, I need to wait because of  this. So that's it, guys. That's the type of clients that you want. That's what's going to  happen. So Porter, amazing job for setting the record of losing the most clients in two weeks.  But lesson learned is that, like you said, your clients have to make money,  your clients have to make money, and sometimes the money that's on the table isn't the money  that you should take. Okay. So next thing I want to ask you, you started really hot,  right? You started, let's call it October, November. You landed a bunch of deals,  almost got to 10K, and then you took your foot off the gas. Now, I know part of that was because you  had to go full time and with the farming and stuff like that. But what happened there? I mean, I  assume from the outside looking in, you kind of got the wind knocked out of you, kind of got a  little bit demotivated when you lost four clients, or was it mainly strictly to do with just being  distracted by the other, by taking over the farm? No, I think it has everything to do with I lost  four clients. I think being busy was an excuse, but I lost four clients. And it was like, I went  from making 9,000 to making like 3,000. And it kind of was like, it scared me a little bit. And I was  like, I got to hold on to these two clients. So I was almost like, what do I got to do to make sure  they're closing jobs so I don't make the same mistake? But what I didn't realize is like,  that's normal. And it's like, when you scale at a rapid pace, not all those people, like you said,  are going to be solid. So you just kind of have to keep the good ones and be okay with",

    "pageContent": "losing some  of these bad ones. But it was all a mentality of like, I wanted to get to 10K. And it was like,  that number was so big to me, like, because I wasn't, I mean, as far as like relevance with  money and like knowing how much a 10,000 is a lot of money, but like, there's more out there,  and I should expect more than that. I just was so afraid to like, hit that, you know what I'm  saying? I don't even know why it was like a mental roadblock. And then finally, I set a goal to hit  20,000, then I hit 10,000. And then I'm like, I just need to keep shooting my goals higher,  so that the goal that I'm going to hit is seems less than what I'm actually shooting for. Like,  it was just a mental thing. A lot of this is just mental. Like, if you can get over, you know,  spending the money, running the ads, being willing to make mistakes or lose clients,  and not take this so emotional, just say, Hey, this is just business. You're so much better off,  you know, I just was, I lost a trip when I was on a like, you lose a client while you're on like a  trip, or you're not around. And it makes you like, feel like you're, you're crappy, or you've done  something wrong. But it's in reality, it's like, it's probably just the client that you picked. And  it was just a bad time. So so you went down from almost 10k to two clients, right? Yeah. And are  those two clients that you went down to still with you? Yeah, I still have them. Go figure,  right? Just what I was saying, those two clients, if you treat them decently, or good, or heaven  forbid, you treat them really good, those clients will probably be with you for the next five, six,  seven, 10 years. So that's what I'm saying. He went out of let's say, when he got to nine and a  half, he probably had seven clients, he lost five, right? The two 20% of his clients, or whatever  that number is, it's less than that. He kept two clients. That too, is his base that those clients  are lifers, as long as he does a decent job doesn't jack up the price doesn't the leads don't fall  completely off. He does a decent job, those clients are going to be with him. And that's exactly what  I'm talking about. So anyway, that's, that's, that is completely normal to happen there. And the  reason why you felt it so much is because you weren't taking enough action that you were  replacing clients as you were losing them. And again, we're not trying to discourage you and  say you're going to lose all of your clients. Absolutely not. If you guys go and pick good  clients, you shouldn't lose any of them. And if you take the time, but what ends up happening,  as Porter said, is as you're trying to get the next deal, you let off the gas a little bit on  this one, if they're not making money, then you risk losing them. Okay, it's just part of the game,  you got to expect it. How did you manage and how do you manage clients with, you know, when you're  in your busy season, and I'm speaking because I know a lot of people on here have other businesses,  other jobs, other responsibilities, and maybe times of the year, they get very busy.",

    "pageContent": " How have you learned to manage your clients during your busy season, which is basically from  March to October?  Yeah, I think the contact with them is huge. I think at least once a month, I feel like the first  six months are the hardest. After you get past six months, you usually can  stop communicating quite as much. I still check in and make sure that they're getting the calls  they need and saying, hey, can you send me pictures, try and update the pictures, you know,  trying to do things. But I mean, in reality, it's just like, hey, are you closing jobs?  How many of these jobs have you closed? How booked out are you? Because if they're busy,  they're going to be fine, right? It's like when they don't have work, when they don't have stuff  that they can do, that's when they get all weird about paying you. But when they're booked out  three or four months, dude, they don't care that they're just trying to keep up. So I think the  contact is huge. But I really don't think that's even as big as just making sure, hey, are you  closing jobs? If you're not, what's the problem? And is it the leads? Because most of the time,  it isn't. Most of the time, it's something they're doing. Maybe it's the way they're  answering the phone, how fast they're calling the lead back. And I kind of try to help them  examine where that they've gone wrong. Phil felt found with another business owner. And then,  you know, I help them with that. And I've usually, I mean, other than if they're really bad business  owners, or, you know, I really have not had issues with losing clients like I did that first year.  Yeah. And that's another thing, guys, when you when you start touching in with touching base  to your clients, make sure that especially during that first six month window, that you're really  taking the time like that's going to be the most hands on you're ever going to be if you can get  them past the first six months, and re sign them into another year. Your your your chances of losing  them is going to be a lot less, it's going to go way down. So during the first few months,  make sure you're checking in monthly at the minimum by monthly would be better and weekly  would be amazing. And what I usually like to do is I like to check in, hey, here's how many leads  you got. And you'd be surprised how many business owners go, I didn't get that many leads. And you're  like, yeah, you did. And you should like, let's get on a zoom here, you know, whatever. And you  start going through it. And you sent them 20 leads, but they only answered 15. You just lost  five right off the top because they don't know the answer. Right. Just go to their phone. Then  of the 15 that they answered, they only booked calls with 12 because they don't know how to book  because the you know, instead of saying, hey, we're a bit out, but we'll put you on a cancellation  list. They're just like, hey, just so you know, we're 12 weeks booked out. And they completely  discouraged that they don't know how to talk to these people. And then of the 12 they book,  they have two that cancel before they come because they don't have any touches in between.  And then of the 10 that they they get to the house, they give estimates to all 10. And they  only follow up with",

    "pageContent": "none of them. And they end up closing, you know, so you start realizing and you  can kind of start getting into the weeds with these guys and seeing where they're going wrong.  But guys, you got to remember if you guys have read the E-Myth where it talks about most people  that start a business, especially in the trades, in the home services, these guys worked for  another crew. They either got mad at their boss or they were decent at their job. And they're  like, I'm going to go start my own crew. That does not qualify them to be business owners.  Most of these guys, even if they're really good at what they do, they do not know how to  how to run a business. Some of the best craftsmen are the worst business owners because they just  don't know what they're doing. They're just they're just good at doing the thing. They're  not good at business. OK, so anyway, without getting off in the weeds, make sure that these  people are making money. That's the lesson and the takeaway that I'm taking from this.  OK, Porter, if you were starting today, took everything away, all your clients,  you just had your knowledge. You couldn't reach out to any of your existing clients or old clients.  How long do you realistically think it would take you to go from zero to 10K per month if  you started today? Really, like if I did if I did nothing but this, I bet three months I could get  three months. I get to 10K like that's two clients a month. Like I could easily do that.  I've been in a couple of months. I could do that. Yeah, that's two fifteen hundred ish.  That'd be a that'd be a stretch, but it's doable. I'll tell you guys this.  When in 2020 now, this wasn't just me, by the way, this was me. Francesca was managing most of the  sites. I had somebody that was when the leads would come in, I had somebody that was helping  me call and hook the business owners and I had somebody answering the leads and transferring  the leads. And all I would do was once the business owner was hooked and we found that  they were interested, I would come in, I would talk to the business owner and then I would close  the deal. So we had like a four man team in April, about mid April, like April 15th to May 15th. I  think if I'm if memory serves me correct in 2020, I set a goal with my team. I said I want to do  something crazy. I said I would like to add and I would like to add ten thousand dollars in new  revenue in one thirty day period. Ten thousand dollars of brand new revenue, no SEO, no paper  lead deals, only flat fee deals, new clients. And with that tiny little team, we did it. We hit it.  We took team golfing, had a good time. Interestingly enough, that's April, right?  Three months prior, four months prior, my total revenue was eight to ten thousand dollars a month,  most of that being made up by SEO and one flat fee client. So you can do a lot now.  Fast forward to 2021, August of 2021, in a single month, we added twenty four thousand dollars  of new deals, new monthly recurring revenue in a single month. OK, so three months is completely  doable. I think you could do three. I think anyone on this call, if you were actually doing work and  with singular focus and you were actually just focused on getting deals,  I think you could do that in three months. I",

I think for those of you that just started, I think you  get your first deal in three months, but you got to get the first one and you got to get the second  one in Porter. Once you get the first one, is it just me or is the second one come way easier?  Way easier. Well, it's just like a mindset thing. It's so funny. It's just like it just clicks.  It's like you can do it now. And as much as you've watched Porter talk about it,  as much as you've watched me, as much as you've watched Kyle or Jason or Ryan Dalton or whoever,  it's always like, yeah, but my situation is different. And it's not OK. Porter's got a kid.  I've got kids. Porter's got taken over the family farm. He also does stuff at his church he goes to,  which means he's got other responsibilities. He's got in-laws that he has to entertain  and he has to keep. I mean, he's got stuff just like everybody else does. So  don't think that you're special. Porter, what's one thing that you did right that you would do  again? If you started again today, what's one thing that you did right that you would do again?  That's a good question.  And if you want, my next question is what's one thing you did wrong that you would do differently?  And if that one's easier to answer, we can start with that one.  One thing I did wrong was... That one's always easier to answer.  That one's always easier to answer. I think a lot of it was my due diligence too. I think  picking... There's been times where I've just picked the wrong city because I was so like,  I wanted to get a deal so fast that I would say, okay, I got like 10 cities narrowed it down to  five and then I got like two that are like neck and neck and I really didn't know. And it wasn't  like a really like a yes. It didn't really scream yes, but it was still good. And I felt like I  should have just waited. I should have just really done my... Taken my time, got my due diligence  right because it saves you so much time on the back end when it comes to ranking and whatnot.  And it also helps you with finding clients. It's so much easier to find clients when it's  low-hanging fruit. But I will say you'll get caught in analysis paralysis if you're not careful,  so you can't just do due diligence for months and months. But at the same time, I was spending a day  on sometimes looking at cities and I'd make a decision in a day and I should have spent two  or three days going in and making sure that this was a good area. So I would say I definitely got  impatient and I was skipping steps within the course. And if I would have taken that time to  do it, I would have been better off. For example, another thing I did wrong, there have been times  where I've wanted to deal so bad that I thought that going into Facebook and going down in the  Google Maps section to hook business owners was going to be faster than actually creating a list.  And it is so far wrong. I would call business owners and I would get them on a Zoom call  and they wouldn't have money. And I was like, why are they they don't have money? But they  weren't running Google Ads. They weren't doing what you said in the course. But I thought that  I knew better that I could go there",

And then I get another deal and then I start doing something stupid. And then I lose  four deals. You know, like it's just like you got to stick to what works and stop trying to reinvent  the wheel. Yeah, it's that that, you know, the thing in sales, kiss, keep it stupid, simple,  or keep it simple, stupid. It's that whole thing, guys, I promise you. Everybody does this. You  thought that look, I've created a process. And by the way, this wasn't just it just didn't just come  to my mind from nowhere. I created a process from watching thousands of hours of content,  from buying twenty three thousand dollars in courses, from talking to people, paying mentors.  And over the period, a period of three, four or five years, let's say I started in 2016,  I launched this program in 2020 and 2021. So six years, I developed this process that is very  simple and it works. And if you guys just follow it, it will get you a deal. And at the end of the  deal, you can just start at the beginning and do it again. But everybody does that. They get smart.  They get they, you know, I'm going to I'm going to do this. I'm going to do that.  And the reality is, is there's a reason why this process works. There's a reason why you get why I  was able to use it to scale to six figures a month. There's a reason why it's worked for  hundreds of other people. It's a reason why Ryan Dalton's at eighty seven thousand a month using  the same process in two years. Just go back to the basics. I know that's such a such a boring  advice. You know, I always heard everyone talk about John Wooden, how every year he would  teach his players how to put on their socks correctly, because if they didn't do that,  then they would get blisters and that would affect every part of their game.  And then he would talk about the basketball. You talk about the lines and you talk about  the chess pass and the bounce pass. It sounds really dumb, but the fundamentals are what win  games. And so I think a lot of us have gotten away from the fundamentals, which is go into a  boring niche, go into a city based on the due diligence process that we teach you in the  training. And if it doesn't match exactly, don't go into it. And I know it gets frustrating because,  oh, I got to go look at another city, guys. If you're worried about the time it takes to do  due diligence, go use the ranking engine tool. It speeds it up a lot more. OK, but don't be afraid  to look at a hundred cities to find the one good city, because if you do that, that one city is  going to be a moneymaker and you're going to be able to rank it quickly. You're going to make a  ton of money on it and it's going to be worth way better than what Porter's done. And I've also  done where you just jump into a city and niche and it ends up being the wrong way. Guys, when we  started back in 16, I brought Kyle on back in 2018. He used to go, we had no sales process.  Basically, our meeting would be like, hey, all right, guys, go get some business owners. And  literally Kyle was just",

He ended up selling this deal, guys. He got this guy, shout out to Kyle.  He got this guy to buy 50 websites from us that we own. Great deal. It actually saved us from  basically going under because we were not very cash rich at that time. And I will tell you that  we just went and built, we went and built 50 sites. And I can tell you, not with 100% certainty,  but I would say 95% certainty that of those 50, I don't think we have a single one of those websites  that we still have existing on the interwebs. I think we got rid of all of them. We got rid  of the domains. None of them were built in cities where we were ever going to rank because it was  in the wrong niche. We got away from the basics, right? The only thing that got me to a hundred  thousand a month was going back to the basics, focusing on one thing, just like we talked about  last week, guys, eliminating everything else, simplifying my life, just working, not worrying  about the boys trips, not worried about the pickleball, not worried about the golf, not  worried about the Netflix freaking Tiger King and this, that, and the rest, unless it's the weekends  and just working. And that's how I made, that's how I completely changed my life. Okay.  Porter, we got a question for Joshua Archer. He says, Hey Porter, what was helpful as you worked  through the content? Did you watch and take a lot of notes, watch everything all the way through,  then repeat, watch one video, then act on it? Porter, how did you do it? And then I'll tell people  how I would recommend them doing it. Yeah, I can't watch the whole thing at once and then like wrap  my head around it. So like I'd watch a video and then I would do what it said. So like Nick said,  you know, pick a city. That's what I would do. I'd focus on the city and then I would focus on the  due diligence part of it. And then like the list part and then with content, like I guess,  I guess this is just in general, right? The content of the course. He's talking about going  through the course. Yeah. Yeah. So I would, I would just do exactly how fast Nick does it. So like  just watch the topic, do the work, do, do, do like a couple of modules, do the work and just do it  side by side. Just that worked for me. Cause that way it wasn't like overwhelming and I was able to  like see it from A to Z. Yeah. I recommend the same thing. Go through it guys. If I say to do  something in it, this is not because I'm trying to run a dictatorship here, but if I say to do  something, stop the video, do it. Right. If I says, Hey, go watch this video. Go now go. Here's the  due diligence. Now go pick your city in your niche. Do not go to building your list until you found  your city niche. And you guys might be stuck on build, you know, your city and niche for two weeks.  I hope it doesn't take you that long. Hopefully you can do it in a few days, but you might be.  And I don't even want you to move on until then. I don't want you watching the SEO. I don't want  you watching part two, how",

So they get  through the first part and it's like, Oh, now you gotta, you gotta pick a city in a niche.  It's like, well, let me watch how to build a list and then how to call the business owner.  And it's like, no, just do it as you go through it. And then by the time you've watched the  training, you've got a deal. Right. You do not need, by the way, if any of you guys are watching  this, you don't have a deal. You should not even be touching section two of the content.  It is not valuable for you to know how to rank a website unless you have a client.  Right. Oh, but I need to be able to talk the lingo and talk about that. Yeah, I get that. But guys,  you can go get a client without knowing how to do that. Trust me. Okay. If you don't have money  coming in, you got a hobby, not a business. Okay. Two more questions I want to ask you,  Porter. Now that you're at 10 K, what does your average day look like?  So I always try to, I always look at my phone to make sure that my Stripe account goes through.  So I always make sure that the payments, the clients that I do have are still paying.  I think I've learned now, something that I'm doing now is I'm trying to be more on top of it,  like having something ready to go next time. What I was doing before was I'd have a site or I'd have  a city and I wouldn't look for any new cities until that one was closed. But then I was always  a month or a couple of weeks behind because I didn't have anything ready to go. So I think  being prepared, that's something that I would do, like focus on and something I would do better  the next time around is be a little bit more prepared. But an average day, wake up,  make sure my Stripe account goes through, make sure the leads are coming through, whatever.  And then I'm just trying to find new cities because I don't have a team. So a lot of it's  doing it myself. So I'm trying to have cities that I can do, doing the boring stuff when the  calling is not available. And then during the day when the business owners are out and about or at  nights, I'll try to call them. But I try to do the boring stuff when you shouldn't be calling  anybody. But the prime calling time, make sure you save that for like hooking business owners  and trying to close deals. Yeah, I like that. And I would say the prime time should be the time you  have the best energy. When you haven't exhausted, like you don't need to go spend your best hours  right when you wake up and your brain's really fresh to go build a website, right? Spend that  when you're just ate lunch and you feel like you should take a nap. Okay. All right. Last  question for reporter is where are you going to be at by the end of 2025? And if you don't hit it,  we are going to slash your tires, something like that. So where are you going to be at, bud?  I want to be, I want to be at $25,000. I set a goal at the beginning of this year to,  well, it was part of last year, but I set goals like before the year ended, but it's kind of  rolling into this year, but I",

But  even if I go to slow rate, even if I could just have something in the works every single month,  there are still times where I could close deals. And if I have a process set in place where I can  still be able to rank these out and have a team, then I don't think that's too far fetched. But  I want to be at 25 by the end of the year. Totally doable, bro. Because if you can go to  10K in three months from zero, then you should be able to hit another 15K and retain your 10K  and beat up to 25K. So we're going to hold you to that. There are a couple more questions,  but Porter, if you don't mind, if you don't mind, once we get off to go and just comment  and answer those questions on a comment, I think that'd be great. Like Shiju has one.  He asked about search volume. I will tell you, we just did a live on search volume. If you're  using RankinRent, the RankinRent engine, which I think we ended up saying to be very, very safe.  If the tool says 70 searches per month, on the main keywords, with a lower than $5 CPC, you're  safe to go. If the niche is moderately competitive, if it's very, very low hanging fruit,  you could probably get away with 50 searches. But nonetheless, guys, go watch that live. That was  back when Ryan and I did this. I was in Dubai. I think that was when, anyway, we called it the  magic number, the golden number on search volume or something like that. So anyway, Porter, thanks  for jumping on. Appreciate you guys being on, guys. Let's go. Remember, it's January. People  are spending money again. They're excited. They want to clean up their yard. They want to have  that fresh year. They've got goals just like you. Go hit up all your business owners. Let's go ahead  and see if I got a message back from my boy. If not, then I'm going to hit the next one up.  Let's just go ahead and see. I'm going to use that line you just did.  Tell me to eat sand at any point. Oh, dog. Here it is.  Here it is, bud. I'm going to show it to you so you guys don't know I'm not lying.  I don't want to show you the number, but how do I do this? Anyway, he just said right here, he said  it's today at 2.35, which was 25 minutes ago. He said, let's do it. Just got to set up a time.  Boom, dude. He was paying us I think $2,000 a month when we were doing this. This is for my agency,  guys, of course. This isn't for new students. Again, let me go ahead and read that for you  because I do think it was quite nice if you guys want to use that line. I was going to use  something a little more vulgar, but I didn't. I said, feel free to tell me to go eat sand at  any point, but would love to hop on a Zoom or phone call and see how we can work together.  Look forward to hearing from you soon. Just so you guys know, the week before Christmas,  I hit him up with a message. It said, hey, let's jump on a call, see if we",

You can ask it whenever the hell you want, but here's what I found is if I go through the steps  of the prospecting script, as long as you get your main pitch out and they're still listening to you,  you let them know, hey, I'm going to send you some leads. I want to talk in a couple days.  And they're still cool with that. You got airtime and you just have to read it as a human. Like  after that, and they're like, yeah, that sounds good. Okay, cool. I'm going to send you a lead,  blah, blah, blah. Who do I send it to? Now? I got a little bit of time. If they're giving it to me,  I'm going to ask them to say, okay, so just to double check, do you guys, you guys will  do concrete repairs or do you strictly want like new work? And they're like, okay, new work. All  right. And do you do stamp and flat work or just like, that's a perfect time with what Josh is  saying. Make sure, okay, is there any zip codes that you don't cover? Because obviously every city  has some ghetto and I, you know, I can't get, there's going to be some stuff that comes in  just naturally, but it would be nice to know upfront if you just won't go there, whatever, right?",

    "pageContent": " Hey guys, another question that comes in quite often, especially in the late fall and in the  winter for certain niches, is you guys are seeing that your CPC is increasing. So let's say you set  it up and your CPC top page bid is like eight to nine dollars and all of a sudden November comes  around and you're noticing that it's like doubling or tripling in price. We do see this in concrete  a little bit. Definitely a big factor in tree service and part of those reasons is just  understanding these niches and understanding the cycle of those businesses. So I can tell you with  tree service, typically the best time to trim a tree and or remove a tree is going to be in the  fall and in the winter because the tree's not trying to grow, it's dying, it's kind of dead  and stagnant. It's the best time to have somebody come out and lop everything off and trim it up and  all that so that it has a better rebirth in spring. So those bids are going to be more  expensive because this is when people are calling to have that service done. So it's just about  competition, it's about Google making money, Google understanding the market space, but that's why we  talk about you get these people for all year and you'll see that wave. It'll go high, it'll go low,  but there's an average amount as well. So don't get too worried about it. If you see it go up,  you'll typically see things like tree service, concrete, like spray foam, things like that.  You'll see them come in in certain waves, but at the end of the year you'll kind of see that it  kind of averages out.",

So I would say do not use any type of debit card issued by a bank  because I think I said it in a video or something that I posted a group.  When you go and do that initial charge, it's coming from overseas. It's not coming from the  United States. So if you're here and you're doing a charge wherever it's coming from,  it could send a block. Now, they're so fast that as soon as they feel that, done, suspicious payment.  They don't give you that. It's done so fast that you don't get like that. Today I got one on my  phone for my AAH ref's charge. So every five or six months, I get a thing and they're like,  hey, are you approving this? And I'm thinking like, yeah, no shit, it's a recurring payment.  But for whatever reason, every five or six months, my credit card company makes sure  that I approved it. But it's because it's coming from out of country.  But with Google, it happens so fast that you get flagged right away and then there's nobody to talk  to because there's nobody answering those phones. So if you have a debit card, those have a lot  because that's protecting your cash right now. So they're going to have a more scrutiny on the  security features with it.

Dude, Irving, you and Eugene, by the way,  for anyone that doesn't know,  Eugene and Irving are their partners.  You're gonna get to a point,  and you guys have been doing this for a while now,  but just keep making offers, keep doing Zoom calls.  You're gonna get to a point, Irving,  where you're gonna know with like 98% certainty  whether you're getting the deal or not.  And it's like a soft skill.  It's gonna be impossible for me to say,  yeah, when they say this, this, this, and this guarantee,  you're gonna do enough of these.  And I've done enough where I know by the way  they're talking, the way they're texting,  the way they're interacting, the tone of their voice,  how many leads I've sent them, timing.  I know if I'm getting the deal.  And guys, it's to the point now,  excuse me, it got to the point in late 2021  when we were going super hard.  I, like guys, I didn't lose deals.  Like I just didn't like ever lose deals.  Like you, but I also knew what I was looking for  and I only got on Zoom calls with people who were my fit.  So my advice to you would be,  you guys are doing this already,  take really good notes of like, okay, I closed this guy.  What are some of the things that were consistent there?  Okay, he said this, he said this,  we sent him three leads, he closed one.  And it was over this period.  And I know Eugene's really good at keeping track  of that kind of stuff.  But it's just one of those things that's a soft skill.  You're gonna learn it.  It's really hard to teach it without the experience.  But you guys are doing enough deals.

And here's how  I look at it. If you're paying for leads or you're paying for ads and you tell me you're  not hungry to grow, you're a dumbass. That means you're allergic to money, right? So number one is,  I think the biggest telltale sign is they're paying for ads. Now, does it get a little bit trickier  if they're on Home Advisor and you're like, oh, well, are they active on Home Advisor? Did they  have Home Advisor in the past? Now it's shut off. There's a difference between being on Home  Advisor, being on Andy's List and actually actively paying, right? But if they're paying  for Google Ads, it's a pretty good sign. But that's a good question, Spencer. I think, yeah,  Spencer asked that. For me, it's a feeling. For me, it's a soft skill. For me, I got to hear  their tone of their voice. I got to do that cold call and I can tell. And here's the advice I want  to give you is when you are in doubt, when you are in doubt if that business owner is actually  legitimately hungry to grow, heat check them, pull back right there on the spot, okay? Here's  the example. All right, get to the end of the call. Hey, Mr. Business Owner, you got done. You got  the phone number. I'm going to send you a couple of leads. Hey, let me just ask you this really  quick. And I hate to be like, you know, repeating myself, but like, are you hungry to grow? Because  look, I want to work with you. I'm willing to give you a couple of leads at no charge. But if  I'm going to just, if I'm going to call you with a lead that's live and you're not going to answer  the phone, just tell me right now so that I don't waste my time, okay? Because I'm only going to  work with one company. Are you actually hungry to grow? You just tell me what I want to hear.  I know when I say that out loud, that's like, oh shit, that's pretty bold.  Yeah, it is. But guess what? You right there by doing that pullback, you are going to give them  the chance that if they actually are not interested, they actually are not hungry,  they can just run along. They can let you know right there on the spot. Yeah, actually Spencer,  it's funny you asked that. I don't know, man. I don't know if we're like, we're actually that  hungry and blah, blah, blah. Okay, cool. Thanks for telling me. Thanks for telling me. Now,  is it just because you don't understand what I'm doing here or are you like, and maybe like,  don't be afraid to check people, man. A lot of times we get that, yes, yeah, it sounds good,  but we're like deep down, we know they're actually not interested. They're just telling us what we  want to hear, but we're so damn afraid to ask the hard questions because of what we might hear.  Be okay to ask that question, even if it means you might get the answer you don't want to hear,  because I'd rather do that than waste the next three days and three leads on somebody  who's ghosting me.

So what we like to do is put the location back and just put a little divider right there,  put Concrete, alright, search domains, ok that's available.  So perfect.  We definitely never want to switch to .com, we don't want to do .co, .net, blah blah  blah.  So QueenCreek.com, continue to cart, perfect.  We definitely just want to do a year to start off.  And then we always like to add the full domain protection, so get it.  And then I'm ready to pay.  And then complete purchase.  And after we're done purchasing we're going to connect it to our Weebly website, should  be fairly simple.  There you go, perfect.  So I am going to continue connecting to an existing site.  Ok, and the destination is Weebly, right here.  Connect domain.  Ok, and here is going to give you the steps.  Go to Weebly, click edit next to your site, want to connect, click settings and then click  change under site.  So make sure you copy this right here, command copy, go back to Weebly, and what we like  to do is click publish just to save it.  So we're going to click save and publish, we like to just do the pro up here.  The reason why we publish it, it's because that's how you save websites on Weebly.  So anytime you make an edit, make sure you always click the publish, publish, publish.  Then we're going to click exit, now you can click out of it.  So this is our website that we built.  Click, just click right here, don't click on edit website, just click right here, ok.  Click on these three dots and then edit domain.  You're going to click provide your domain and you're going to paste in the domain that  you just bought.  Click save, perfect, and then you're actually going on edit website, ok, domain, click on  settings, we want to change that.  So just name it the same as the page title, queen creek concrete, uncheck that, click  save, enable SSL, ok, it should tell you that, then click publish again, because again we  always want to save everything that we're doing, ok, perfect, and you're done.  And just so you know, right now it says not secure, because when we clicked on settings,  it's still doing it.  So just make sure you check on it later and it is secure and you're done, that's all you  need to do.",

Okay so I went to a close with the guy and I told him the price  and I priced out 1500 bucks a month and from right then and there he just had told me that  he was too far out like he was he couldn't do business so right there it was my fault because  I asked him I was like how when could you get an estimate he told me tomorrow like the next  whatever that week and I was like okay I didn't bother to ask him work-wise he was three months  out so that was that was my fault right there I so I should have dug deeper and done a little  better and I think the pricing was a little too high so the guy basically kind of shuttered that  price right yeah that's what it kind of seemed like like it was either yeah that's the price  was just too high as he might like I should have put it lower and he just buckled as soon as I  set 1500 bucks a month so here's the deal and this is a good point and we were talking about  this a couple hours ago when I was in dylan but guys a lot of times they the the business owners  sometimes not a lot of times but sometimes they don't tell you their actual objection  right so what did this guy do he he dylan dropped price and he shit his pants and instead of saying  oh that's too expensive what did he do he said oh I'm too busy right not to mention he's paying  for was it home advisor yeah he's paying for home advice okay paying for home advisor hasn't ever  said a damn word about being too busy he's not allergic to money so he's lying through his teeth  the real reason isn't because he's backed out bro the real reason is because you fucking scared him  with price which I love because you're pricing correctly but here's the deal the the only way  that you're going to overcome that because it should sting that's that's fine okay the only  thing I would say is the way you're going to make that not happen in the future is on your pre-closed  screencast you need to make sure to emphasize how much value they're going to be getting from  these leads without overselling it right so you're on the calculator you're going to show them hey  like dude look man at five thousand dollars and 30 or let's see 15 leads and 30 profit 30 percent  close you're going to make six thousand dollars of profit twenty thousand dollars of net of gross  revenue like that's insane that's from 15 and like what if I get you 30 so the key is dude you just  need to build more value on when you're doing the screencast so that when you get on you're just  going to like you almost need to get them thinking like dude he's going to charge me three grand or  some shit like that yeah right and so one thing you could even drop in dude is you could say you  know how it says six thousand in the bottom right hand corner when you put the stuff in right you  could say something like this you could go what we typically like to do is we like we like to look  at the worst case scenario and we want to make sure we at least double your money right so we want  to make sure so then if he starts doing the math he's like fuck dude he might charge me three grand  a month right because six thousand divided by two so just little things like that but the only way  is you need to build more value I believe on the screencast with the price calculator but also  I think and that comes with me and you communicating is you probably didn't show  enough social proof with some of these other clients",

    "pageContent": " Alright guys, let's talk about the one pager, what we need to absolutely include.  I'm gonna call this the 1.2 million dollar template and the reason why is because I have  literally spent that much money on Google at the time of recording this and by doing  that, I've been able to test a lot of things on landing pages.  I've been able to test if the picture should go here, if the website or if the quote form  should go right there, what questions we should ask, how big should the phone number be, where  should we put this.  I've tested all that stuff over the course of 1.2 million dollars and I'm going to show  you the template that if you can replicate this, you are going to be fine.  You can add your own little flavors, but I'm gonna go over some of the non-negotiables  that you must include on this one page template.  Again, this is something you have to do right once, so take your time, just like the keyword  list.  Do the keyword list correctly.  Do the one pager well the first time and guess what?  Next time, you just copy and paste, you swap out the, hey, instead of concrete, it's tree  surface.  Instead of tree surface, it's this, okay?  You swap out the phone number, maybe you swap out the colors, swap out the pictures and  the content, done, done and done.  Okay, so take your time and make this really, really good.  All right, guys, so here you can see a quick example of what I would consider a perfect  landing page.  I know some of you guys that are coming from WordPress backgrounds or you have the design  out, you're like, oh my gosh, this?  Like this right here?  Yes, this, okay?  Let me tell you about this, okay?  You're looking at albuquerqueconcrete.weebly.com.  I built this, actually I didn't, my team built this website a year and two months ago, okay?  We did our regular process that we teach in here, we ran ads, we went and found a business  owner, we closed the deal, awesome, okay?  And something happened and that is I forgot to follow up and have my project manager build  the actual website.  We got the deal and we forgot to build the website, okay?  So about, oh, was it about a month and a half ago, I reached out to Francesca and I said,  Francesca, give me a rankings report on these cities, okay?  And so she went through and one of the cities was albuquerqueconcrete.  So I was looking at the rankings report and I said, oh, where's the rankings for that  one?  Because I was just looking at that client.  And she said, yeah, I was gonna tell you about that, she's like, we don't have a website  for that one.  I'm like, what do you mean we don't have a website for that one?  She's like, yeah, we don't have a website for that one.  We've been running ads to the one pager for a year.  So guys, I had done the deal at whatever, let's call it a thousand bucks, I can't remember  the exact specifics on that deal, a thousand bucks.  I was spending 500, and in this case, I think it was even less.  And I was making the difference, 500 to 700 dollars of profit the entire time, even though  I didn't have a website.  I just set up the ads and I was pushing the leads and I had the credit card involved and  I was",

    "pageContent": "arbitraging this thing.  So I know this doesn't look great.  I know it's like, this is very basic.  I know, I know, I know, but guess what?  It works.  It works, it works, it works, and it will produce leads.  So let's take a look at some of the things you have to include, okay?  Number one, I'm just gonna show you, and you guys are free to go build your one pager on  Wix, Wordpress, I don't care, it doesn't actually matter.  And I'm not gonna spend time going in and showing you how to use a web builder, because  guys, it's not hard.  You literally go and drag stuff over, like you drag a picture over, you drag the content  down.  It's not difficult, okay?  Couple things I'm gonna show you, and these are like non-negotiable.  So number one is the phone number.  The phone number needs to be the centerpiece of this website.  So as you can see here on the screen, it is the centerpiece, it's the thing that pops,  and honestly, I think it could be even a little bit bigger.  Do not, and I understand, most websites, they have the big writing, it says Albuquerque  Concrete, like this big, right?  And then the phone number is this little teeny thing, probably not even underneath, it's  up in the corner, because it looks sleek, okay?  And guess what, I don't care about sleek, I care about freaking making money, and in  order to make money, phone needs to rain, okay?  So what I'm gonna do is, you need to start thinking about the customer.  If you have a customer looking for concrete, quit making it difficult for them to call  you.  Quit making it difficult for them to get ahold of you, to ask for an estimate.  So everything that you do, the psychology here is, how do we make this as easy as possible  for somebody looking for concrete to call us, and therefore grabbing that lead?  And one of the things is, making that phone number right there in their face, and the  last thing I want to point out on this phone number, is it's a click to call.  Meaning, I highlighted it, and I did a call, an action button, which means if they click  on it, it's immediately going to call directly to the phone number, which is the tracking  number, which goes to the business owner.  And the best thing to do there is, I like to, so link it up, make sure it's click to  call, and I like to add an underline.  A lot of times on these web builders, when you make it click to call, it adds the underline.  I am going to tell you right now, go and manually add the underline, because it just triggers  in people's brain, oh, I can click on that, it's a link, it's a phone number.  So that is a click to call, you can see.  So add that.  You honestly, I just include this somewhere on the screen, not as important as the phone  number.  Phone number, that's the number one non-negotiable, needs to be big, bold, center, and it needs  to be click to call.  Next thing is this quote form.  And there's a right way to do this, and there's a wrong way to do this.  One thing that I think helps a lot is with the quote form making it pop.  And one thing that I've found to make it pop is to make it have a background.  Okay, so you can see right here,",

    "pageContent": "this isn't just like a quote form that says free instant  quote and it's kind of tucked in the corner, right?  It's not.  It is, it's got a background, it just kind of pops against that white.  So I would encourage you to do the same, okay?  And another couple things about this quote form is make it seem as if when they fill  this out, they put in their information, they put in what concrete surface they need, the  square footage, all that, make it almost seem like as soon as they push get my quote, they're  gonna get an immediate email.  I want it to seem almost like you're gonna open up your email or your text message and  you're gonna have a quote, okay?  That's the psychology behind it.  And guys, we are going to get them an immediate quote because we're gonna call them immediately  or the business owner's gonna call them immediately, okay?  So on the instant quote, make sure it pops.  I like to add the free instant quote, free instant estimate, whatever.  I like to make sure the word instant is in there because I want people thinking, hey,  I can get price quick because they're gonna get price quick, we're gonna call them.  I like to throw a little exclamation point.  You can experiment around with this plus free bonus coupon thing.  I don't even think that's necessary and some people are gonna watch this go, what's the  bonus coupon?  Honestly, I don't even think it's necessary.  So that doesn't matter, okay?  You can include it if you want.  Okay, guys, so there's a few things with this quote form that need to be done right and  you're probably like, I never thought that this much thought went into the quote form.  This much thought goes into the quote form, okay?  So I wanna show you what most people do.  So I just went ahead and I typed in Albuquerque concrete.  I looked at the first person ranking, okay?  It's this company called Duke City, whatever.  Now this is more like a ready mix, whatever.  So I know it's not necessarily the exact same thing but I just wanna prove a point without  spending a ton of time.  If you look, first of all, their quote forms are nowhere to be found, okay?  They're definitely not in that first like fold where you're like, oh, there's the quote  form, let me get a quote.  And side note, good luck finding the phone number.  I don't even see a phone number on here so we're gonna win based on that.  If I wanted to contact these guys, I have to work.  I don't want to make the customer work, okay?  So if you scroll all the way to the bottom, this is what most people do, is contact us,  okay?  Contact us to me as a customer, literally screams, hey, solicit me.  Call me and bug me, okay?  You enter your name, your email, your subject, like that just means they literally put a,  that just means they put no thought into this.  Your subject, what do you mean your subject, right?  And then your message, this is the dumbest thing ever, then it says submit.  This is such a standard BS crap, if you guys do this, I see this, I'm gonna be pissed.  Do not do this.  Contrast that, which is what 99% of people do, oh, good job by the way, Duke, find your  number at the bottom, not click to call, so now I have to go, I have to write it down  and then put it in.",

    "pageContent": " Not a good strategy, but that's a side note, okay?  Go back to this.  Contrast what you just saw with this one.  You look at the bottom, you're looking at the screen, you're like, oh, free instant  quote, okay?  Here's the kicker, instead of just hitting them and saying, hey, free instant quote,  give me your name, your phone number, your email, your address, your this, your that,  your social security number, okay, don't do that, okay?  What you need to do is psychologically, we wanna get them down the rabbit hole a little  bit.  So, the first thing they see is instead of saying, hey, give me your name, we're asking  them a question.  We're saying, what concrete service do you need?  And they can look and go driveway, sidewalk, walkway, patio, okay, well, we were just looking  at, oh, or other, okay, okay, so I'm gonna choose sidewalk.  Approximate size, square footage of project, right, and they're like, I don't really know,  but look, probably more than 100, okay?  Now think about it like this.  The customer's already answered two questions, it says instant, and now we're like, oh, by  the way, give us your name and your phone number and your email, and it says, get my  quote.  This right here is a completely different and psychologically just, it's on point because  we're getting them, and think about it if you're a human, you're like, oh, I've already  answered two of the questions, I may as well just drop in my name and email and get a quote  in the chance that they're gonna just email it to me, right?  They might just email it to me.  So guys, the keys here to look at with this quote is make it pop, okay?  Make sure you ask one to two questions related to that service that almost make it seem like  they're gonna get an instant quote in the form of an email, okay?  Even though they are gonna get an instant quote in the form of a phone call, you almost  want it to be like it's an auto-generated thing, okay?  So ask two questions and then ask for, at the very most, name, phone number, email.  Now I know some people and some business owners are gonna go, hey, can you just get the addresses?  Can you get this?  Can you get that?  Guys, there's a fine line.  You ask too many questions here, people aren't, they're gonna be discouraged.  But when it's the name, phone number, email, things that they literally have memorized  and it's very simple and easy, they're willing to give it after they've answered a couple  questions.  I'm telling you right now, I've tested flipping this and asking for the name, phone number,  email, and then the questions.  I get way better conversion out of this where we ask one, two questions, okay?  And then we go name, phone number, email, boom, get my quote.  Guys, that is the one-pagers.  These are the things that are non-negotiables that have to be included and that is a bold  centered phone number that needs to be underlined, it needs to be clicked to call, okay?  It needs to be the centerpiece of your website.  By the way, at this stage, if you would like to use your cell phone, you can use your cell  phone.  However, I would recommend using a call tracking service so that it's, first of all, not your  phone",

    "pageContent": "number.  Second of all, you know that it came from that website.  Have you ever gotten your phone out and you missed calls and you're like, man, I wonder  if they called me from my company website, they called me from this, call me from that.  You don't even know, especially if you have multiple sites feeding into that phone number,  that's gonna get really tricky really quick because when you call, when they call, you're  not gonna know who it is, okay?  So I do recommend using a call tracking service, but it's not necessary if this is your first  project and you're on a thin budget.  I get it.  So make sure that's there.  And then the quote form, and not only the quote form, make sure it pops.  Make sure you ask at least two questions.  So for example, if it was masonry, it could say, you know, you could say, what service  do you need?  Or you could say something like, you could ask a yes, no question.  You could go, like one of the questions we do is, how soon do you need the service?  And we'll have an option that's like, okay, ASAP, within the week, within the month, or  I'm flexible, okay?  You can ask something like that, but ask at least two questions first and then name, phone  number, email, get my quote.  Anything else outside of this, I would just model over this.  You know, I had a couple of photos, whatever, just make it simple.  Lastly, this content, okay?  You do not have to go and write content from scratch.  You do not need to just go and blast out content, look at your keyword list, do the whole thing.  You're actually free to go and swipe this from this website if you're in concrete, from  another website, if you're in another niche, because, you know, taking someone's content,  you're gonna get what they call black box at some point.  If you copy content, you're gonna get in trouble with Google, they're gonna, you know, not  ever let your site rank.  But we're not trying to make the site rank because if you guys understand the process,  as soon as we get the deal, we're gonna use this one to push the traffic to, we're gonna  get the leads, but once we sign the contract, we're then gonna build out our main website  and that's where we're gonna take the time to build the nice content and the nice photos  and make sure that the site looks a little bit more presentable, et cetera.  This is the down and dirty.  Guys, include these things and remember, and by the way, I do have to say, if you would  like to just go and start testing stuff out, you're free to do that, but what I'm showing  you here, as simple as it looks, is a $1.2 million template and I say that because I've  spent that much money testing and tweaking and dragging and changing and this and that  and I've found that if you do it just like this and include these main couple of things,  you are gonna get leads.",

    "pageContent": " All right, now that we have created the website, we're just missing the images.  So rule of thumb, we get 25 images total for our website that has three service pages and  that does not include the header photo.  So it's 25 plus 126 and the 26 photo is the header image.  So right here where it looks blue is going to be your header photo.  There is usually the best way you can get images is just by asking the business owner  that you landed.  The reason why is because you're going to be the best pictures you can get the most  local, the most like authentic photos for this.  It's going to make the website look really local, very authentic instead of getting stock  images.  So that's what we recommend you doing.  You do need to remember two rules when you're doing that.  Number one is when you're asking the business owner for photos, make sure that they are  not being used on his own website.  A lot of the times when you're pitching and you're selling leads, what happens is the  business owner already has a social media account, a Facebook page or their own website.  So we do not, and again, we do not want to use photos that are already being used by  him or her on their website or social media because that would be copyright.  So any photos that he sends you, they need to be fresh or unused on his own platforms.  That being said, that is the first rule.  Number two, let's say he has some fresh images or he's going to take pictures for you.  And one thing that I personally do is I just say, Hey, if you don't have photos, next  time you do go on the job, just take some on your phone and usually an iPhone camera  will be pretty good.  Take them on your phone and email them to me.  And then the number two rule is make sure that the pictures that are being taken do  not have the company's logo on it.  And just be attention.  Like a lot of the time, the concrete contractors will wear a t-shirt that has their company  logo on it or they'll drive a truck that has the company logo on it.  So make sure that the pictures that you're taking from the business owner do not have  their company name on it because we are targeting this website as Queen Creek concrete.  And if in the future you ever need to switch up the business owner, you don't have to  worry about, Oh, well, it's marketing that company.  So those are the two basic rules for images.  And then one last thing, let's say you cannot get images from the business owner.  You can.  And we do use stock images.  We like to use the free trials.  So for example, just go on Google and type free stock images and we'll have a video on  how to optimize images and get, grab those images.  But right now I'm just showing you very quickly.  We use like stock Adobe, Shutterstock.  They all have free trials that you can use.  So just go ahead and take advantage of those and you're done.",

I'm not kidding  so  The couple calls i've been on recently what i've heard is  Guys, I definitely think it's important to let them know. Hey, please don't leave me in  I don't know zone make sure that like just give me a yes or no  but some of you guys are saying that in such a way that it's scaring people off like  There's a couple ways to say that and you don't need to say hey just just to confirm  You will give me a yes or no by the end of this, correct? Like  That's just adding pressure that doesn't need to be added in a different way of saying that it would be like  Hey, like I told you the only thing I ask is just don't leave me in. I don't know zone. That's all I ask  Okay, i've given you enough references and everything else by the end of this. This is a good fit  Let's move forward if it's not then let's not but that's my only ask. Is that fair?  Those are completely different. One of them is giving a ton of pressure. Oh shit.

I don't want to I don't want to have to go into this high pressure situation  so guys  Take the pressure off the call  Take the pressure off of the customer because that is not going to help you that is not something that helps you get the deal  Okay, even though at the end you're going to ask for the deal and if needed we're going to apply a little pressure  We don't want the whole call them to be thinking about that close and thinking about how do I get them off the call?  so so  Take off the pressure. Okay number one and I just want you to be thinking about that the whole time  and and it's kind of like even like um, I know like with ryan even it's like it's and and and  Mahmood's been doing this on his calls like my whole sales pitch is like hey if this makes sense great  If not, no harm, no foul if not, no big deal  I'm repeating these phrases because I want this to seem like no big deal even though deep down  This is a huge deal for me",

    "pageContent": " Hey, Gene, maybe I need to be focusing my guys in on these contracts.  That's one area I might have gotten too smart.  I just went month to month.  And maybe they're dude, that's a hundred percent, bro.  It's not even about the like, I'm not saying that's a hundred percent,  but like, if you're not doing a contract, you're crazy.  That's like why it's part of the process.  It's not that if they sign a six month contract,  you're even going to take them to court.  Like, let's be real, the amount of money it's going to cost you to take them to court  and how much you're going to get, it's not really worth it.  The fact of the matter is when they know that there's a contract  and they physically or they intentionally sign it,  that is them committing.  And I always use this analogy.  Is it easier for someone to end a relationship  that is like a boyfriend, girlfriend relationship or a marriage?  You might have like some real shit going on in your marriage,  but because you've committed, because you've gone through that process,  you've signed that shit.  And because it's not as easy to get out of without having a little bit of like shit happen,  people think twice, man.  People think twice, three times, four times, sign that thing.  Even though you know damn well that like at the end of the day,  you're probably not going to get anything from them in court.  It's them signing, it's them committing.  And here's how I pitched the contract, Gene.  I say, look, yeah, of course there's a contract.  I'm committing to you.  I'm a hundred percent exclusive to you.  I can't talk to any other business owners.  If we don't do an agreement, then that's like me being committed to you,  but you can quit at any time.  I'm committing to you.  I'm ceasing all conversations with business owners.  I'm going all in on you.  That's like having a marriage where only one person's married,  the other person could do whatever the hell they want.  It doesn't make sense.  Yes, there's a contract.  It's six months.  At the end of six months, if you don't like me, I don't like you, we end that shit.  But my guess is that at the end of this thing,  you're just going to ask me if I can keep the price the same  and not increase the price because I'm going to be killing it for you.  That's how I pitch it.  Don't shy away from it.  Contract's not a big deal.  We sign contracts every day.  We get contracts on our phone.  We got contracts in our houses.  Most people have contracts on their cars.  People have contracts on everything.  We got all kinds of stuff.  Isaac, we just went to the gym.  We just signed a three-year contract in the gym.  Contracts are part of life.  Don't let people tell you, I don't do contracts.  Bullshit.  Ask them, did you pay for your phone outright?  I actually did.  Funny thing is I say that I actually bought the shit outright.  But 99% of people, they have contracts.  That's part of life.",

And then as soon as one starts to pop off, you can pause the other two, okay?  If an ad campaign is set up and running, but it's not getting impressions and it's not  getting clicks, or if it's not getting clicks, it's not costing you, okay?  So get a couple up and just make sure to watch it like a hawk so you don't go spend a bunch  of money that you don't have or that you don't want to spend.  And then you can pause them and just focus on the one.",

A business  owner is not digging it, misses some calls, and when he does pick up, it's spam calls.  Any suggestions for a situation like this? I told him to pick up every call, follow up every call,  because the call he misses out might be a juicy one that he'll miss out on.  I don't know what you're using. I know with some of these tools, you can blacklist some of these,  but I'm going to be honest, I've had this happen a lot, and I think not a lot, but it had to happen  a few times. I think when you're buying tracking numbers, you just got to realize that sometimes  you get a shitty one, and sometimes it's a number that's been spammed out, and so there have been a  couple instances where we've just had to change the phone number, and it sucks because you have  to go and update it on your GMB and the whole thing, but what I would do first is try and do  the blacklisting thing and see if you can figure that out, and then if you absolutely have to,  I think it's worth it long term to just let the business owner say, hey, we're going to have a  little bit of a decrease in calls, but we're getting a new phone number to get rid of this issue,  and now every call that comes in should be a good one. Now you've got to go update your citations  and all that good stuff, but nonetheless, I think that it's worth it at some point.",

Definitely do soft touches, bro.  So here's the thing, guys, we're coming in for all of us that are in this group.  Those are you that were my freaking OGs that joined the for the very first batch of people.  You guys were the first cohort, by the way, shout out to all you guys when this was just a freaking thought in my head and you guys gave me money and you're like, I think this guy is going to pull through, man.  I think I shout out to you guys.  OK, I know I gave you guys a discount, but I can't thank you guys enough for trusting me.  And anyway, I always say that because I feel indebted to you guys.  Thank you. OK, but for those of you that are the OGs that joined back last year, we did this.  We launched this thing in the middle of the winter, in the middle of the quote unquote worst month of the year.  OK, and guys, trust me.  And when I say quote unquote, it's because I think every month is bad in some way and good in some way.  OK, it's bad because it's harder to get leads.  But guess what? The business owners are hungry.  The summer is bad because the business owners are full.  Their stomachs are full, but it's it's easier and it's good because the leads are cheap because, you know, people need the service stuff.  So I believe I say it's bad because everyone looks at it like that's the slow time.  We launched this thing in December and we had people getting deals left and right and all the rest.  So first and foremost, if you see a slowdown, it's part of the game.  And as we start to see these slowdowns, there's weather, there's recession,  there's this whole thing with the opting out of the search networks, et cetera.  Right. We just have to be strategic.  Go back to our the setup, go back to overcoming, sorry, not overcoming, eliminating objection.  If you are seeing that, just bring it up.  So when you get on and you hook the business owner, say, hey, Mr.  Business Owner, hey, Mrs. Business Owner, I'm going to get you a couple of leads.  I don't know if it's going to be tomorrow, if it's going to be in three days.  It might take a couple of weeks. I want to get you some good ones.  OK, so I'll I'll be in touch, but let me get you a couple of good ones and then let's talk.  And then my rule of thumb is I usually get them if they close the first lead,  boom, I'm pitching it or I get them, you know, three to five leads or I just feel that it's right.  So, Drew, all I would say, yeah, for sure, do the soft touches.  You can maybe let them know, hey, you know, whatever.  We've got some some funky calls coming in.  It's pretty normal this time of year.  If it's not a big deal to you, it's not a big deal to them.  We've I've closed plenty of deals in October or November now.  This is a great month still.  And guys, we launched this thing in December and people were closing deals left and right.  So it's it's something we're just got to realize we're going to  we're going to be sending these people",

    "pageContent": " Citations, okay?  What are citations?  I know that wasn't the question, but let's talk about citations.  I know we're going basic, guys, but citations.  Citations have to do with your Google My Business.  The reason why we put that on the due diligence at the top is because citations are,  you guys remember when you set up your Google My Business  and it asks you for the name, the address, and the phone number.  It's called the NAP, N-A-P, right?  That is the core.  That is the basis.  That is the gospel.  That right there, that name, address, phone number,  what Google's doing in a citation is where else around the internet  is that name, address, phone number listed exactly like that?  Is it Yellow Pages? Is it Facebook?  Where, what places are those three things,  name, address, phone number, cited across the web, okay?  And the number of those typically does matter, okay?  The sheer volume of those.  So if you go look at citations, and one person has 5,000 citations,  which I've never seen, they typically have less than 50,  but let's say they have 500 citations,  that's going to be somebody that you need to look at that, okay?  But I want to clarify, citations have to do with the Google Maps,  have to do with ranking in the Google Maps section, not with the organic,  even though technically a high ranking in the Google Maps  will influence your organic ranking.  But when we're talking about citations,  and you look at the due diligence and it says citation,  we are referring to those things,  where is your name, address, phone number that shows on Google,  the exact one on Google, where else is it cited across the internet?  And how many places is it cited?  That's citations, whereas backlinks is how many other websites  are backlinked to you basically raising their hand and saying,  hey, I endorse this guy, and I'm popular, I'm so-and-so, I'm Forbes,  and I endorse lasvegastreeservice.com, right?

    "pageContent": " Hey guys, another question that I get quite often is some of you are asking like how much should you  invest or how much should you spend in Google Ads before you give up on a deal? So first thing is  that's to me is that's the wrong mindset to have. You lose money when you quit, you lose money when  you stop. Yes there is such thing as learning and making mistakes and all that but that's why we  really emphasize hitting good due diligence, choosing the right city, choosing the right niche.  When running Google Ads there's going to be some niches that are going to be a little bit more  expensive than others. That's why we try to have a really good due diligence process and you get  a pretty good idea of that when you set up and run your, when you're setting up your Google Ad  campaign. With that being said, you know if I'm running like say like something like towing  where I need to have a lot of volume to make money, I'm going to probably spend a little bit  more money in the beginning to land a new business owner than something maybe more like landscape or  landscape design where I'm probably going to get less leads than I would for towing and I'm not  going to be spending as much on that. So that question is a little loaded where it just you  got to know your niche, you got to look at the volume. So that's why we use the data of search  volume, CPC and then we set our budget and that'll help understand like where we should be at like in  a month and stuff like that and then that'll give you that expectation of where you should be at.  Hopefully that answers that question.",

    "pageContent": " Jeff, what are the common things, most common things that you're seeing and let's, let's yeah,  what are the most common things you're seeing of why people are getting suspended? Let's start there.  Great. Well, so there are the, one of the common things that I'm seeing is,  there are several of them, but one of them is, is people are setting up  their MCC account and they're, and a lot of them are doing it like on their first time,  fresh Google ads, like first ad they've ever ran. And it seems like there's a lot of guys  that are missing a step. And I know not, I don't know if everybody has access to the 2.0,  but I've been referring, if you have access to 1.0, that's how you should be setting up your ad.  If you have access to 2.0, your video goes over that in really good detail, but I've kind of  referred them all back to say, go back through that and just really, really slow. And a lot of  what it is, I'll use the word like the hierarchy of how you set up an MCC account. So what some of  them are doing is they're setting up, and this is going to be one type of suspension that I'm seeing.  So some people that are setting up their ads, they feel like they're getting some running and  then they have to get that verification comes through. Then they go run their verification  and they can't get verified. And what's, what I'm seeing as a common theme with them is they set up  the MCC. So they set up their, I'm going to call it like their Google ad profile. Like they use  that Gmail to open up a Google ads and they do an MCC. And then they start running campaigns  directly underneath that. And if you go into the MCC, there's actually a spot where it says add  account. And you need to, before you run a campaign, you need to add an account that goes  underneath that, that goes inside of that or under, if this was like your Google ad profile,  you add an account here and then you add a campaign underneath that. And that's how like  the hierarchy of it should go. What's happening is people are setting up that, yeah, you got a  piece of paper. Yeah. Just what you're saying. It's like, yeah, by the way, real quick, for those  that are just brand new today, tell them what an MCC account, I know we're going very fundamental,  but let's just, what is an MCC account for someone that's like, what's that mean?  Well, it's, I would prefer people not do it until they have like 15 or 20 ads because it  gets confusing if you've never done it. But essentially it's, it's an account that you use  to manage quote unquote other people's ad accounts or you get brought on as a verifier. So like I run  a lot of Google ads for some political consulting that I do, and I will get added as the admin  or the manager for them. So my, my account will take over and has access to it. Basically it's  through a proxy that they give me. When you set up your own MCC and you set up the own accounts,  you can do that. But it, if you've never done one, it can be a little confusing for people.  Some people are setting up their MCC as a, like just like, it's like a solo account instead of  just doing an account. And on the right-hand side where your little profile picture is,  it's just adding an account, adding an account, add an account. They're",

Like I have multiple ad accounts for multiple clients  that are not related to each other at all. So guys, essentially if you guys like,  let's say it's your first time you go to Google ads. And I, and to my understanding, Jeff, maybe  you can correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think they ever just automatically give you an  MCC account. It's by default, they just give you a regular account, right? Yeah. You have to, yeah,  you do have to, I think I'm going to use the word apply for it. It's been so long since I've done  that, but I think you just hit it and you like kind of apply for it when you sign up initially  and you can apply for it. But that, that's kind of what's triggering some of these people's  verification issues. And because they didn't set up the MCC right, the way that it's the, they,  they don't have like the account and then the campaign, they have all the campaigns under it.  Well, that, that's supposed to be you like directly who you are. And you try to verify like  all of a sudden five or six websites. And it's like, Whoa, so the Google AI bot that's checking  it just goes, that looks weird. That's not, that's not who you say you are. Cause you all of a sudden  have five or six different like websites or properties you're advertising on. If it was  my property that I registered and I'm running direct ads for me, like say it for my business  and more my domain and everything would match. They might go, Oh, that makes sense. I get it.  You're running your own ads there. But when I'm running like concrete experts and you know,  outdoor kitchen or whatever, I have to set those up in a certain way so that it shows that my main  account is managing that accounts campaigns. Correct. That makes sense. So if you, if you go  in, you've never done ads and you go in, it's, you're going to just set them up. Like he's  talking about, because you're not going to have an MCC account, which is basically a manager account.  Once you, once you convert or apply for an MCC, all he's saying is guys, just make sure that with  each separate property, you guys create an account first as an additional layer. And then  you create the campaign inside of the account. And I saw Marie Marie just said like an umbrella.  It's exactly like that. It's kind of like this. Let's call the top layer is like a grandpa,  right? And then the accounts are your parent accounts. And then you have the child account,  which is the campaigns. So just make sure we're not skipping a step. And guys, with any of these  suspensions, here's how I look at it. You can get mad at Google all you want, but if I was Google,  I would do the same exact shit they're doing. Can you imagine somebody this randomly gets on  and they put in a credit card and let's say it's a word to get into this, it's a gift card or some  random card and they never spent any money. They have a brand new account. I don't know who you are.  I don't give a shit about your 20 bucks a day. I'm Google. I would much rather suspend you.  And then my thinking would be, well, if he's serious about this, he's going",

That's a way better because if not, if they just let everyone spend money,  now I'm complaining. We're dealing with the bank. We've got all these partners. So guys,  you get mad at Google all you want, but at that level, you would do the same exact thing.  So whenever you're doing something, think about it. Is this going to look sketchy?  Is this going to make Google think that I am somebody that's sketchy? Guys, a gift card that  has a finite amount of money on the damn card. Like if you were my client, I wouldn't let you  take, put a gift card in there. So why would Google? So that's number one, make sure that it's  set up properly. And I like the word Jeff used hierarchy. You got the MCC, then you got the  account, then you got the campaign. If you don't have an MCC, it's just going to be your regular  login. And then you're going to go straight into your, I think it's just straight into campaigns.  You can only have one, it's one account, right? Well, so you have like your, it's kind of weird  because Google doesn't do a good job of defining it, but like under your ad profile, let's say  whatever Gmail you use, then you set up a Google ad account. If you go back and hit that icon in  the top right, you can just add another account. You just hit add Google account and it kind of  sets it up very similarly to an MCC. Well, you have to log in and out of these different emails.  No, I mean, you can't set up that way. I have, I have multiple, I have like five emails that they  use. And I have the same, I have the same credit card on them. I have the same PayPal account on  them. Like, yeah. So you're almost creating an MCC account by without having an MCC account,  because you have these, you're separating them by different emails or whatever. Some, yes. I have  like kind of groups. And if you go back to like, if for the ones that, if the 2.0 training setting  up the MCC is confusing, if you go back to the 1.0, the original, I think it's module three,  you'll see how you set up a campaign there. You can follow that method and you'll, and that,  like that will be easier if you've never done it. And it's probably going to give less flags and  it's less opportunity for you to screw up. Like what is an ad? What is an account? What is a  profile? What is a campaign? And so I think that anyway, so that's something I would tell everyone,  just go back to those trainings if you have access to one or the other and just go slow.  And by the way, my thought process there, the reason why I used this new account is because  in version 1.0, we did it that way. So I wanted, cause other people were like, well, what about  when it's this way? So that, if you need to just access both, you get the training, you get this  1.0, 2.0 up till whatever point out. So that's number one. What's what else? What other other  things you're seeing? And that's it. So that, are you seeing that trigger a circumventing or a  suspicious payments? I think that one is mostly triggering verification suspension. So they're not  letting people",

In the land down under, so I'm going to have Levi jump on in just a second here and share he is definitely trailblazing over 40 closes over 15 active rank and rank legions this guy has already done enough rinse and repeat.  He's definitely an og so let's see here without further ado, let me start the recording and then get Levi in.  Okay.  I can also check the volume and the sound. Can you guys let me know if you can hear me.  I want to make sure that this new mic is doing its job.  Okay.  Okay, we are live in the right group. Good.  And I can see myself.  Hey Levi.  How's it going buddy.  Good.  Good. Are you caffeinated.  No, I don't drink coffee. Oh wow, you're just get up and go huh. Yeah, this role role.  All right.  I'm impressed.  So, for those who don't know you Levi, can you tell everyone.  When you got into the space and how it came about, what happened, how did you find yourself in this program.  How I found myself in this program I think someone told me about the group. I think I checked it out. And then I found out he's got a paid course and I'll just jumped right into it.  I skipped all the free stuff and just went straight into it.  I just, I don't know if it's me being lazy or I just, I'll value something a lot more if I put money into it, and I see a better return faster, because it's like I have to make this work.  Rather than doing the free stuff, you kind of skim on by and I'm sure there's a lot of guys out there that would just keep skimming on by and they don't actually take that action to get something started.  Back in 2022, this one I joined.  Yeah, it's like, what is the same, nothing wagered nothing gained, like you put your money where your mouth is, and you keep yourself accountable that way if it's just a free course like, you know, take it or leave it but when you're paying for it, you kind of  make it work to use it.  Yeah, that's a good way to explain it. Yeah, so you jumped on immediately in 2022. And did you start running through the process or did you set it aside and go do something else did you did you dive right in right into it.  I think it was like day 29 or something I got my first deal. And then it was pretty much near like a month after that I think I've got another deal and then a couple months after that I've got another deal and it just kept kind of going from there.  Wow, that's awesome.  Yeah, so you, you definitely don't write in then it took me a while to close a rank and rank deal. I've done so much other stuff when I started.  It took over a year to close anything that has to do with the lead generation or rank and rank so yeah that tells me you really focus like you did not get distracted, and you just hammered that process over and over, rinsed and repeated.  Yeah, so many phone calls, which is good, because that first client is still with me to this day.  Do you care to share the niche.  Oh, really. Yeah, nice. Are you getting volume are you getting",

Yeah, you're definitely compensated with the volume.  Yeah, because it is low ticket just like here right like lawn mowing would be, first of all, reoccurring so when you get an account it's like, it keeps paying so that's a good thing.  But it is low ticket you're looking at, I don't know, 50 bucks every time they do it or something like that here, I just paid $200 to get my yard mode.  Yep. And yeah, it depends. It depends where you live. So for me I pay $150 for the entire month. Yeah, that is awesome that it is expensive over there so it makes sense and the fact that it would be quite like you're quite periods of during, I guess, winter when nothing grows but then right now where it's raining every couple days, the grass is shooting up and the guys are loving it.  Yep. Oh, I believe it. Yeah, when you have that sun rain sun rain, the grass just goes crazy. We have that here too in Florida.  During the summer where you can't keep up with the with the grass anymore. It just goes wild. I love that man so you had this guy this whole time. How does he do when things get scarce like, does he freak out or is he cool with it.  We've gone through, like, I don't know if you call it rough patches where he's caught up saying he wants to cancel.  And it was just a simple matter of just talking and figuring out what's going on and we're able to work something out came to an agreement whether  I'll reduce the payment for a little bit for like, I don't know a month I think I said, but then after that I'm going to increase them. And I think I ended up increasing it, but it's not like a massive paying client like I think it's only like six hundred bucks a month or something.  But yeah, I just I increased it pretty much a little bit from there, and I'll probably end up increasing it again soon ish. He understands he sees the value in it now. A lot of his clients aren't even residential just all the commercial jobs that come through.  So he's got a couple of the commercial jobs and they're like 3k a month and he only goes there. Maybe once a weekend in a month. And you'll do that. There's got a few of those that come through.  Yeah, I mean, he's definitely getting a great deal with you. Is this all organic?  Yeah, all organic now. Yep. Beautiful. Beautiful. It was my first ever site I ever built ever ranked ever did anything with.  Yeah, that's awesome man.  Yeah, I definitely see you increasing your price with him. You just have to nurture him. You know, every year he's going to get more and more convinced that this is this is what he needs.  And I like that he already went through a couple of seasonality cycles. So he knows what the low looks like and what the high looks like.  So yeah, once he, you know, puts all his numbers and goes through his numbers and stuff, he'll he will see that there's a return on investment.  So yeah, your service definitely makes sense to him, especially with the crazy volume you're getting him. That's a $2,000 a month website.  Yeah, it's just a matter of bringing him up there little by little. Every year you can, you know, you can.  As he grows, I'm able to increase the price pretty much as",

That's that's no joke, because if you're paying a couple hundred dollars to to mow a residential, I mean, to mow commercial that's that's a lot more.  And if he just does one commercial job a month that covers for your fee, you know, four or five times over. So yeah, I like it, man.  I like it, man. So you've done the lawn mowing and then you you created you had momentum right after that first deal, you stayed on.  Yeah, kept on. I did the whole let's run five different ad campaigns at the same time and burn myself out really quick.  Yeah, I think everyone's kind of done that.  Um, let my lesson really quick, choose through your money really fast when you're not able to pay attention to every single job coming through.  And you kind of start from the wrong foot where I never had any any list built out. So I didn't know who to contact when these jobs came through.  So I was just all up in the air. That screwed me over a little bit.  And eventually, I think at the right timing to I just canceled, I think, four or three other of the ads out of the five, and I only had one or two running.  And then from that one or two, I was able to just kind of focus on those two and get a client for that and I was in the concrete niche.  Nice. And concrete niche is good in Australia. Is it like a like a year year round thing?  Everything is yearly, like it's all everything in Australia is all year round. I have yet to find something that's not.  Deck building is probably the only thing that's like a yearly like a that that's seasonal. I think everything else is is all year round. I think yeah decking and pool builds.  I would imagine are the only two things that are seasonal.  That's awesome that so Australia is prime for for rank and rent then and because oh yeah you have you guys have the four seasons in one day situation right like you get in rain and sun and so but but it doesn't freeze right.  No, no, no cold.  Down south, there's a little bit of cold and on some mountain peaks you might get snow but I would say 98% of Australia is not like this. There's no snow. Yeah, my knowledge.  I like that I mean a lot of it is an uninhabited and you know Bush and desert and all that stuff but when you go to a populated area, you can run a rank and rent and run it no issues, no seasonality issues or anything for the most part.  Yeah, I like that and concrete is one of them because concrete takes a beating.  It, you know, it expands and it contracts and the sun the water. So yeah, Australia should be prime for concrete because there's a lot of erosion, concrete erosion going on cracks and all that stuff in Australian weather is a little rough like especially the heat, it gets pretty, pretty crazy right.  Well, I think, what was it yesterday was like, see I don't know what it is in Fahrenheit but it was 31 or 32 degrees Celsius it was 8% or 90% humidity. It was like 42 degrees so I think that's in the 90s, I think, and yeah, yeah.  What is it 31 centigrade.  Okay, so it feels like 107 Fahrenheit.  Holy smokes.  Yeah, that's an oven. Okay.  I see why it works.  That's awesome. What other niches or",

What else we got I'm trying to think off the top of my head.  Landscapers.  There's a few, I'm pretty just stuck with fencing and concrete, like the other two that I'm in.  Oh, okay, nice. Fencing is good too.  Yeah, yeah.  Fencing and concrete. Okay.  Nice. So, what, how do you see yourself, handling the deals now versus when you started, what, what has changed since  I don't think so.  Same process.  I've probably adjusted a little bit, but nothing crazy like if you compare what Nick teaches and what I do, it's, I'd say it's very similar, you'll be able to compare like apples for apples almost.  Right. So you're not getting creative, you're just sticking to it.  Yeah, I try and keep my basic.  I don't want to overcomplicate stuff but I'd rather keep it nice and simple and just go with that.  Yeah, I have I have complicated things before and it backfired.  I have freestyled the script before I have done the screen recording differently I've done did things differently and sometimes it works and sometimes it backfires.  I do go off script, when I have like an existing client, like we just I just closed one yesterday and they're already. He was already a client of mine we were doing other stuff like other marketing stuff.  And then we discovered that we could do rank and rent for them. So that one I didn't go through the entire thing. I just sent them, you know, two or three and they're like yeah this is good.  And we have done a call yesterday for like 15 minutes and that was it just a bit more than me, I'll just send him a text message and we just both give each other a thumbs up and go from there.  Really you've done that before you close that way.  Yeah, yeah, we'll just send a text message and just get all right this is what we do. This is how much it costs. Sweet.  Like a friend or family. No, no, just a client that I've probably had for a year now.  Yep. He went from, what was he paying? He was paying like $1,600 a month. Now he's doing paying me $1,000 a week.  Sweet. That's good. That's four grand a month.  I like it. And you, you told me off camera that you are in the, you were in the 40,000s and now that you lost a couple of clients recently, you are in the 30s and the mid 30s. Is that accurate?  Yeah, 25, 30s around there. I would say I'm just kind of waiting to see how it all ends up and go from there.  Yep. That's pretty impressive though. And the fact that you did that in two years, that is, that shows consistency for sure.  Yeah, a lot of those clients will come back on in the new year. It's just personal reasons. I know some had health reasons, but they've hurt their back, they've hurt their foot.  Being as like a, just a, the business being dependent on them, I guess that's like, we call them sole traders. It's hard for them. So obviously with those issues, they've obviously paused, cancelled,",

Yeah, you will get a lot of those now because they're trying to save some money, like a couple of weeks.  I've had a couple call up and I just straight up told them that we just continue on through and it's what everyone else is doing. Just continue on through because you're still going to get jobs coming through.  The jobs don't stop coming through. We're still getting jobs coming through to this day. Like I've already had emails come through now, like one, two, two couple jobs there just now in the past two minutes, three minutes.  So it's not like there's no shortage of work coming through. It's consistently paying. So it's not like you're paying for something and you're getting nothing. You're going to be getting jobs coming through, I would dare say, up to Christmas.  It will stop on Christmas and then continue on after that and then stop on New Year's and then continue after that.  Yeah, I mean, that's a great argument. That's a great way to put it. Like the leads don't stop. Yes, you do want to take a break during Christmas and not pay for a week or two, but or you can just schedule in January and still go to your Christmas party.  Have them there and then contact them when you get back. People are contacting you knowing that you're on holidays. It's not like they don't think you're on holidays. It's just they know that you're busy, you're on holidays, you'll get to them when you get to them.  And if you can contact them, you basically by putting yourself out there, you got that opportunity to then contact them later on. Otherwise, you never get that opportunity. If they cancel now, it means they don't get that lead.  And now that they're starting off on a bad foot, because now they've got to wait for more leads to come through. Rather than keeping that pipeline full, they empty the pipeline.  Yes, yes. That's a great argument. Yeah, hitting the ground running once January comes and you're like, you're not shutting down and then come January, like waking up like, oh, let's start over.  So when businesses cancel, they want to pause. I highly suggest not doing it because of the like, you may save like a couple of dollars, but it costs you a lot more in the long run because you go from having a consistent flow of jobs coming through and you'll consistently smash them out. You may not be making great money. You may think, oh, I need to cancel this for a month while I've got a month booked out. But then as soon as that month ends, you're like, fuck, I've got no more jobs.  And when you start learning jobs, it's not going to be straight away. There's, I think on average three to six weeks is what it takes to land a client is what I found just based on talking to my clients. That's three to six weeks of no work that they have coming through.  And now, now they're, that's a whole month where they're not making any money and they're having to pay me. So it sucks. You'd rather make a little bit than make nothing.  Yeah, that puts it into perspective. Like what you're working on today, you will close in a couple of weeks. You're not just going to start in January and start closing right away. You got to nurture the job. So why not keep the wheel turning, not pause.  What I use as an argument also, in addition to that, and you",

I respect your decision, but I'm going to have to find someone else to pick up slack because I don't want to go through this again. I can't pause the ad. And that's when they realized, oh, okay, this is not up to us. It's we need to stick with this. This is not like a picky choosy, you know, take it or leave it.  I want to use it kind of thing.

What is what is the most deals that that you got canceled on like what is what is the worst cancellation streak you had for me it was, I think, three, three in a row in like two weeks.  Probably seven in the past month and a half. Yeah, that one stings man. Yeah, I had to have some hard conversations with some of the clients because and this is every year I think I need to find like a permanent solution is because as soon as Thanksgiving is over, everyone wants to take a break everyone wants to take a nap.  Everyone wants to stop being charged. And the conversation that I always bring is, do you remember, June and July when we were blowing it up.  You didn't ask you didn't ask to cancel then.  And I didn't ask you for more money.  When we were doing really well but now that we're trickling one to a week.  I see that you want to cancel.  This is not what I had in mind when I said a mutually beneficial relationship. This is not what I had in mind when we talked about a win win situation.  I can't give you all the upside and take all the downside, otherwise I'll be out of business so I do blow it up for you in June and July.  I don't want enough cash to justify going through the slow season.  So that's the conversation that I have with them, and a lot of them get it. Actually, a lot of them understand.  But I tell the other ones, if you want to cancel on that, I'm not going to hire a lawyer for $4,000 to go up to come after $4,000 that's not what I'm, but I'm what I'm going to do is I'm going to go find someone else.  If I go back, I'm probably going to be hooked up with someone else and I don't want you to be in that situation where you need me and I'm already engaged with someone else.  And that they get it that way like oh okay so this is like he's not going to pause just because I want to pause he's going to go find someone else, my competitor, I don't want that.  Yeah, or I think any client that's cancelled understands that. Like I said, there's been a couple like from that seven, maybe half will probably sign up again in the new year.  So I'm not too stressed about it. Obviously they're off, they're not paying or anything, but they're going to continue on in the new year.  The other four or so I think one just",

I'm the one taking the risk on them. If I do go with them and usually they'll sell me and they're like yeah please like let's do this.  When I'm telling them no, I don't think this is going to work out. They're the ones that are like yeah let's do this, let's do this, like I'll work really hard, I'll make this work.  Some get it and it clicks for them and they do really well. Others, it just doesn't click fast enough or they're not able to withstand that pressure of all the stress coming through and I don't sugarcoat any of this shit at all.  I would rather tell them straight up that it's going to stress you out. You're going to feel like the world's going to end and you're probably going to want to quit on this and you end up closing down your business if you do quit on it.  Everyone goes through this feeling, it's just a matter of pushing through it and if you can withstand that push through. If you can't withstand that push through, don't even bother starting too much.  I'd rather you not start, you don't waste either of our time where if you're willing to push through this shit and get through all the crap, all the bullshit, all the headaches, the stress of the clients, the stress of clients not paying your money,  the stress of me coming after you for money, like you having to pay me weekly or monthly or whatever, the stress of just being up late and everything. If you can get through all that on the other side, it's awesome. It's just you got to get through that shit bit to get to the good bit.  Yes, absolutely. Go through the shit bit to get to the good bit. Yes. Let's see, I have another question for you here.  To go through that, I'll expand on that. I've had a client that shared with me recently, he was telling me how for a period that he was basically collecting cans, like 10 cent cans and given them and collecting the money for that and that's what he was using to feed his family for a little bit.  Because all his money was invested straight into the business. Wow. Fast forward now that guy's paying me $1,000 a week and he's doing really well. One of the jobs I think he's got is like $2.8 million or something like that. It's like 40 projects that are like 60 grand each.  60 projects that are 40 grand each. Wow. That's crazy. So this guy is like textbook entrepreneur. Yeah, he's done well. It's not his first business. He sold cans to fund the business.  I don't know if you have it in the US or not, but it's like a recycling initiative where you can collect your beer bottle cans and stuff and you give them in. So that's what he was doing just to put some food on the table for his family because all his money was invested in jobs and he didn't have much to do.  Yeah, that's a gangster move right there. Going above and beyond for your business. You mentioned people complaining about too much business like they freak out when there's like too much influx.  I used to not have an answer for that, but I drafted something and I started using it because it is a BS excuse. That's probably the worst excuse I hear is you're sending me too much.  Like that's the point is blowing it up for you as opposed to having really scarce leads. So what I tell them is I don't",

You can take the ones that make the most sense to you and say no to the ones that you don't and outsource them and that way you're raising your price. You're doing less work and you're raising your prices and making more money.  So I don't get that. I don't get the, oh, you're sending me too much. I can't handle it. Yes, you can say no to 40% and say yes to 60% and raise your prices.  So yeah, that's what I've been saying to that because it pissed me off and I didn't have an answer until like a year ago or something like that.  I've never had to really say it because a lot of the guys, at least the ones that I've been qualifying correctly and going through the whole process and they just click like some guys just get the whole process and it clicks for them and all they need is more work and that's like the final piece of the puzzle for them.  Other guys need to go through a few more steps to get them to understand but the guys that understand it, they're increasing their prices. They know right now around Christmas time they're increasing their prices for anyone that wants it done ASAP.  Anyone that wants any project done before Christmas, it's going to cost you an extra 20% more if you want to get it done.  Other guys like the guy that pays me $1,000 a week because he's got a couple different locations now. Some of those locations like the newer locations that he's not fully developed in, he's dropped his prices just to get more jobs coming through, books up a team and then he'll increase the prices.  The areas where he's already established those prices are probably I'd say 20% more than everyone else because he knows the value of what he's doing.  That's smart. Yeah, I mean that's a smart way to go about it instead of trying to jump on every job that we send and freaking out if you don't get it or whatever. Yeah, whatever. You're paying a flat fee so focus on quality not the volume.  Let me take care of the volume. You focus on quality, taking the stuff that makes the most sense to you, the most money and just dumping the rest.  I've had that with my epoxy guy. He does not do epoxy countertops. He only does epoxy floors because he's past that. He used to do it, but now it's not good money.  Yeah, it's not worth his time so now he says no to countertops and outsource them over to his nephew, cousin, whatever.  What's that? How is epoxy? I've never gone into it. I haven't looked into it too hard either. Yeah, it's great because it, first of all, it's a luxury item so it's something that people want, they fancy.  It's not like your toilet just broke and you're pissed off and you just want a plumber to come and fix it because there's shit everywhere, but for epoxy it's like, oh, I want to look at colors.  So it's a luxury item and it's usually $3,500, $5,500 all the way up to $8,000 depending on how fancy or how durable you want it and that makes the ticket price, that makes it worth it.  So if you can just get someone 15 calls a month, that makes a huge difference in their business. If you get them 15, they close 10. That's 40 grand or 50 grand just like that a month.  So if you can start there and then build up and go horizontal or",

So yeah, we've done it successfully in multiple big cities, but now I'm trying to go obscure city because all the big cities are saturated obviously, they have dumped so much ad money.  So now we're going to obscure cities to get the most bang for the buck.  Auto referral for it. I just haven't, like from an old client referred it to me. I just haven't done anything with it just yet.  Just watch that ad, watch the CPC in the ad. It is a luxury item so it might be comparable to roofing, it might be comparable to paint, like a house painting, and it could cost you big pretty quick.  But yeah, it's successful all the time. If you can find a low enough hang in fruit, it will be a successful campaign.  Yeah.  I don't know if we have any questions yet. I can't see them on my computer so I have to open my phone.  Do you guys have any questions?  Let's see.  No, no comments. Oh, here we go. Jean.  Hi, Jean. Jean Clinton, Jean Lenton and Luke Pichard are watching. I appreciate you guys jumping on.  Nick Wood says, two of the big dogs with a money bag next to it. Yes, we are big dogs and we're making money bags, sir.  Learn from the best, Nick. Learn from the best.  All right. Let's see what else do they want to talk to you about. Oh, yes. What is, you've experienced the churn burn. Now, what is that? Do you have a strategy to mitigate that and stay on top of it?  Because it is heartbreaking, man. I've been through these cancellations and they are the most stressful.  Yeah, it used to get to me. Doesn't as much anymore. I think of it as a good thing in a way now, where if they're leaving, it means the ones that are staying are willing to go that extra mile and the ones that are dropping off, they just weren't able to keep up as we continue to grow.  I'd rather have that spot open and find someone else than have it filled with someone that's only putting in 50%. I'd rather them drop off and then find someone that's willing to put in 100% and go that extra 100, like that extra 10% and go 110% to get to that extra mile.  So that's how I kind of think about it now.  It's, I guess the age old saying like it is what it is, like there's not much I can do about it. I got a lot of these times, if they drop off, it's either they've just completely gone ghost and just vanished off the face of the earth.  I've learned not to do deals with young people that are into drugs. So I'm not doing that anymore.  How did you pick up on that?  I saw it on Facebook.  I'm friends with, I got friends with a couple of them on Facebook and yeah, I saw one of the blokes that just disappeared on me and I saw him on Facebook, he started talking about mushrooms and everything.  So I was like, I went on like a little mushroom trip and redeveloped the world or something. Nothing against it. It's just, it was young,  None of them mix well together, pretty much. I think that calls for a recipe for disaster. A couple guys, I think I later on realized they had like a criminal record and sometimes it's worked out fine and they've been awesome.  Other time they've just gone on to start stealing from customers and it's just a, all right, cut off, nothing to do with you.",

I had a con, who I didn't know was a con, just, you know, wreak havoc, you know, taking deposits and running away and all that stuff, right?  You know, just shady contractor stuff. And then I had another one who came up to me clean the first time that we talked and I had just closed him.  And he called me and said, hey, I need to tell you something. I am this and this and this. And he went through his criminal record and he said, I need to be upfront with you. I was into this. I was into this.  And he was, we just parted ways actually. He was one of my best clients for like three years. But he just moved in a different direction now.  But he came to me and he just said, hey, I need to discuss something with you. This is what I've been into. I have turned my life and that is why I changed my last name. This was my last name. Now it is this because, you know, the federal whatever.  But yeah, he was amazing. He was a great, great businessman. And then the other guy was the complete opposite, just a shade. He's never been to the prison, but he was a con for sure. You could like he's been to jail.  He hasn't been to prison, but he's been to jail and he's been has been in courts before and stuff. So yeah, yeah. I mean, those those guys exist and I, I appreciate you mentioning it because you've got to sniff out that stuff.  And that's why we do our due diligence. That's why we make create those lists and we have the profile, Facebook profile of the owner of the company so we know who we're talking to.  You create that avatar in your brain as you're talking to them. Yeah, all this stuff is relevant, especially when it comes to these situations where you're dealing with a young and silly person, an immature person, a con.  He's doing well. Like he was doing 20, 30 K a month, like I think I'm not just by profit for his business. So he was doing good. It's just, yeah, obviously when you mix substance and business and try and do it all together.  Yeah, distraction.  Nothing works out pretty much.  Yeah.  I've had clients just a lot of it's just been personal reasons which is out of my control out of their control, whether it's it's family related whether it's injury related and that's like I guess the biggest thing is injury related when it's when they're still on the tools and they get injured, it screws them up big time.  That's probably the biggest thing that causes for the downturn and I guess loss of a lot of clients.  Probably and then stress, stress is like another big one, and I guess you can kind of call that under personal but it's a bit of, are you willing to push through that shit and go through it.  And I've had some that are stubborn and don't listen when I try and help them out. I've had some that when I say you need to fire this client, or it's like fire this employee.  They don't fire them and it ends up buying them in the ass.  And I could just tell, because I've been through I've listened to other guys tell me this exact conversation.  And that's that's something I've realized now like getting sidetracked a little bit is every single business owner is going through the exact same shit so some guys are here some guys are here but they're on that same path.  And this person here has been through what this person he",

So, what I do often is I'll just talk to this person and say what did you do in this situation, and then pass that knowledge on to this person here, because this person's already gone through it,  they've been through that shit they've gone through the headaches and everything they've dealt with those shitty employees. And then this person is just this is their first time going through it.  So I give them that little bit of guidance.  Sometimes I'll even put them in contact with each other so they can just talk to each other and brainstorm different ideas out and solve a lot of issues I've had some clients that went from.  I don't know they couldn't land any deals, and I put them in contact with this other guy who kind of had that drama at one stage, they are talking now is landing deals and he booked out for months.  So, that's, that's kind of my biggest, I guess, role now is just connecting the new guys with the experienced guys that I, I haven't have my contacts now. So I'm an old client some existing clients like it's not just like my existing clients a lot of my old clients  are still happy to help me out and help help out other guys, it's just, they've moved in a different direction for whatever reason.  Yeah.  Now that's that's a great like connecting them shortcuts the process instead of you showing them how it's done. You show them a business that's almost like a clone of theirs, and they can just copy and paste and swipe all the, you know, the CRM stuff like, yeah, I actually dealt with  business owners who do not use the CRM which is crazy. Not even a spreadsheet. I think maybe two of mine do.  Yeah, not even a spreadsheet they just go with their text messages and call and they just store everything here which is super I try and get everyone on a calendar at least create a calendar and use the calendar, and your notepad on your phone.  Yeah, if you want to do stuff use that, because I go, what's called like a diary it just becomes too complicated when you scroll through pages for at least if it's on your calendar you can have a look and see them and they're what's going on.  Yeah, yeah, agree.  Do you have touch points with these business owners do you do you call them or text them often.  Not really like at the start will be in contact but I'm trying to think like there's a client that I close probably like a couple weeks ago now, like those two are probably contacted them once or twice, and it's been maybe three weeks.  I think I contacted them obviously when we first spoke, and then I contacted them. Once I got like, like once I started sending the jobs through you can say, I got them all set up so it's all automatic.  That's probably the only two times I've contacted them.  Other guys, I think I've contacted he's probably been with me for two months now probably contacted him twice or three times.  That's just like how they are with their business, some guys are contacts, and other guys, I can kind of just let them go, a lot of my older clients.  I'm. I want to say I haven't contacted them for like six months but in reality I probably contacted them like at least once a month, just not knowing it that that little mine client.  I think there was a stage there where I didn't contact him for like eight months.  We just we just caught up because he's in the same town as me so we just caught up went out for lunch, had a chat, went over things and continued on from there.  If possible, that's what I try and do is catch up with clients in person.",

It's a dead giveaway and that's how I found out one of my clients was going to leave me just from didn't have to say anything, but just him in the eyes shaking his hand seeing what he's doing at work.  And just knowing that eventually he's going to cut off and lo and behold he cut off but ended up starting to work with one of his ex employees who ended up going out in his own.  So, funny how it works. Yeah, you can tell a lot by meeting people in person and I think they appreciate catching up with people in, in, in person as well. Like I've caught up or going out to events with a few of them now and we've hung out, and I've went out like to like a, like a bull ride, and like them their kids, one of their employees their family they all came out and we all had a good time.  That's awesome. Yeah, the personal thing for sure I'm still trying it.  I do have clients all over the US so I can't get into a personal meeting with all of them but the local ones. I definitely tried, and I got a couple of them but not all of them, a lot of them just resist it.  Yeah, happy just keeping it transactional, and that's it. And others are like, I thought the same, and give it some time and they'll flip around is what I found. So I had one guy that just didn't really want to communicate and just kind of left it as is.  And now I was like, oh look, I'll come down, we'll catch up, and we'll hang out for a little bit and he's a bit more open to it now. He was, I don't know six months ago when it was like three months into the contract kind of thing.  Yeah.  Like, when, when they want to cancel when when things slow down and they want to cancel actually made a an exception.  Usually, I cancel but I start looking for someone right away to replace, but I made a, instead of canceling. I made an exception and I reduced the price right well since it's organic I'm not running any ads for this one.  I slash the price in half actually. So we went from 400 the week to 200 the week, because first of all it's organic and second, it's Christmas. And third, he's having surgery, so he's not going to be able to do any work, he can only schedule out in January and  So I'm like, can we do that. He's like yeah absolutely we can schedule I can't work, but we can definitely do that so yeah I slash the price in half, 200 instead of canceling it all over and like starting all over and going and hooking someone new.  I thought let me just try this and it worked. And he's like yeah let's do it. Let's slash the price in half, and then we'll reconvene again in January once I recover and pick it up.  So, yeah, yeah, having organic definitely helps in giving you a bit more flexibility of choice with what like options you can provide to them. Yeah. What do you say when someone wants to reduce price but you're, you're running serious as what, how do you, how do you answer that one.  Depends why they want to reduce the price. If they say they don't land any jobs.  Then I say that's on them.  Okay, I try and help them out, but  what is it",

And I was like all right we're going to increase prices back up to like normal rate of $1,600.  And he just.  This was all like my fault, because I did this all over text, rather than call them because it was like Sunday at like 7pm, and I knew he had his kids with them and stuff. So I didn't want to bug him so I just sent him like a text message went to bed.  And later on he started texting me and I was busy for like the next two days so it wasn't to like the third day after I got the chance to call him, found out that he was just human pissed off and everything I didn't realize it.  I said look my apologies and stuff I didn't mean any attention like that.  And we've come to an agreement where artists continue to increase the price but it would just be like $100 per month increase each month.  That way, it's not like a massive increase right off the fucking like right off the bat before Christmas it's like a gradual increase that we can work over.  He's still adamant about canceling. I don't think he will, because he relies on the jobs too much, even though he says he doesn't.  But he's one of those stubborn guys that just won't listen when he's like I'm not lending any jobs. And I listen back to the calls and it's clearly he's the problem.  And I've had other like I, I send these calls to other like other clients of mine and I'll say what do you think of this. And they're like yeah this guy sucks like he can't close any deals he can't talk to the customer properly, his communication shit.  He's just, he's just throwing the customer away he's not even trying to help him at all.  Right. Yeah, we're adding more steps I've heard that too like, you know, they they call and you're like hey why don't you send me an email like no, no, that's not.  Don't change the mode of communication. First of all, and second, you keep the ball in your court, don't put the ball in their court because they'll be like yeah screw it I'm not calling them back.  Well go ahead and submit an email with pictures and everything like Are you kidding me, that's not a text message. Send me a text message, your address name and what you need done.  Right, right. So, yeah, that's definitely a factor.  And I like.  I definitely like digging into their sales process.  But also saying hey, the same my business, okay, the same my process, but I'm happy to help and here are some of the things that I see that needs to be mitigated like  you guys that listen do really well, finally, follow ups you can just do to I've never heard from that guy. That's your job for follow up five follow ups until you get something.  But yeah, I definitely see that.  Now tell me about 2025, what do you, what do you got in.  What are you going to start for 2025.  Now I get back up to 40 grand a month. Definitely, and I think have my processes a bit more doled in. I think while I was at that. Yeah, 40k roughly mark by.  I was kind of all over the place. I think I think I had too much going on at the same time, and it was a given that it was all going to fall apart because the foundation wasn't set properly.

And then when I went to zero to 10k I had the exact same issue and going from 10 to 20k I had the exact same issue, where I'll basically go from like zero to 10 and then I'll drop back down to like five grand a month.  I went from 10 to 20 and I dropped back down to like 10 grand a month.  And now I've gone through the exact same exact same issue going from 20 to 40 and I felt back down to like 25 30 ish.  So it's always just to get to that point, realize what I need, and then go back, fix it up, and then go back up there again, and going back up there again is a lot quicker.  The second time around than the first time around.  Right, but I've got no worries about getting back up there getting back up to that scale.  From that learning experience a lot of those sites that I now have they're all ranked organically and they're producing organically, so I don't need to run ads anymore for a lot of those sites when I when I find new clients with them.  So instead of me having to spend the ad spend on it, I've got leads coming through already where they're generating anywhere from 30 to 90 leads per month.  So I can send those straight to someone else in the, in the new, I've been ready to close up a lot of my team to closing up this Friday.  I would pretty much just be focusing on, I guess, building lists out, checking out new areas, seeing what else can be done, creating, I guess, better stops like system operations, and just fine tuning a lot more stuff as well.  What does your operation look like?  Tell me about the team.  So I got a couple guys I got one that looks after like all the backlinking sort of stuff. And then I wrote another one that looks up I would to that look after like all the website builds.  So right now I've just built out a bunch of websites and like the fencing and concreting niche, and I just let them go, and then I just go through and find clients for them.  And then I just run the ads and go through that whole process from there.  You find the hook, and then you run the app.  So, a little bit differently. So I have clients reaching out to me, and then I run the ad, once they pay me.  Gotcha. So that's probably where my process differs from Nick's current process. So I used to do it.  But now I've just, I got clients reaching out to me.  So I'm able to just do it and that's just from Facebook, where they'll just reach out to me from Facebook, say, Hey, look, this is the area.  This is like the niche room.  And how do you get those to reach out to you? Are you running ads on Facebook?  Yeah, just Facebook ads.  Nice.  And you call them, they're in, they want the leads and you're like, all right, I will go ahead and start sending them to you and then that's when you fire up the ad.  So generally, book a call, that 15 minute call is just me qualifying them. So I still qualify them.  And I don't want to, like, I've had people that will book a call and they're just not suitable and I've had to turn them away.  So I'm only having the call when I'm only moving forward with the guys that are, one,",

And they'll just hire them as a subcontractor in some cases.  And that's how that solves their employee issue where they need an employee, but they can't find anyone.  I'm able to send them one of the guys that reach out to me because they want more work and I'll just pass them straight on to them.  So that's happened in a couple of cases.  From that, qualify them and then they go through the process of, we basically jump on a Zoom call and I go through that wholesale script.  I'd say 90% like Nix, nothing fancy. I just, I still have that script up and read off it.  So I'm not, like, memorizing this stuff or anything. I have it off. I read through it.  We go through the process, go through everything, show them what they need to see and then close the deal.  Once I close the deal, I then start up the ads and get everything running.  I like it. So, yeah, that is such an efficient way to do it.  The way I do it is I run the ad, I make sure that I'm getting leads first, then I go hook and start patching over the calls.  I've done enough to do it in Sheets where I know what works, what doesn't work now.  There's well over 200 that I have just sitting there and I now know, okay, this is a good area.  This is what bad looks like and I'm able to tell.  That's the whole point of that 15 minute call is we have a chat.  I get the information that I need to qualify them.  So I find out how much they're making, how many guys they got working with them, how long they've been in business.  They're probably the main three key points that I look at.  But I ask other stuff like what's your goals? Have you done any other marketing before?  What else is there? What services do you do?  So I can find out all the different services they do.  Some might do concreting and fencing.  Some might do fencing and landscaping.  And I find out how else I can help them because it might start off with, all right, we might start off just doing concreting.  Then they might want to expand into fencing.  They might want to expand into bathroom renovations or whatever it is.  And that's where I'm able to sell that down the line.  I sell that idea to them on that sales call where we talk about, OK, it's not just the concreting jobs you get now,  but you get first choice when we start talking about getting the landscaping jobs that come through as well.  So I'm not going to go to someone else. I'm going to go straight to you.  We can start getting you those jobs.  So instead of getting 30 to 40 concrete jobs per month, you're now getting 60 to 70 concrete and landscaping jobs down the future.  Yep. You're stacking them that way.  They never leave. They're getting everything from you, all their business or half of their business coming from you.  So it's really hard to...  And also you're making it a no-brainer for them.  I mean, the price justifies it.  And yeah, they'll never leave. I like that.  And I have stacked deals before.  I have done like stucco and concrete.  I have done paint and epoxy.  You know, the niches that go together. ",

The biggest thing is as long as you can expand as they expand and you keep up with them.  Yep.  And as long as they expand as you expand as well.  Right. And even if their concrete sucks, but they're still getting a ton of, you know, lawn care jobs, they're like, oh, it justifies it. It's okay.  Yeah.  Otherwise they would have left. They would have cancelled if it was just the concrete.  Yeah, I like it.  That's how it is pretty much.  Like a lot of the clients, they'll do fencing and deck building.  So they'll get heaps of fencing jobs, but then they might only get a couple of decking jobs.  The decking jobs they do get.  Like one client or past client now, I think with like the first month of us sending them decking jobs, it closed like 80 grand just off a couple of jobs.  And that was just in one month.  That's excluding all the fencing jobs.  And I think all the fencing jobs he was doing was like 30 to 40 grand just off the fencing jobs he was making per month.  That's pretty good. Yeah.  I mean, that's another case that he's not going to cancel anytime soon.  He ended up cancelling. Personal reasons though.  Yeah.  80,000 of closed business.  Yeah.  I mean, the thing is that he got me someone else straight away.  So he found me another business and I started working with them.  Once again, young kid not realizing I guess the effort they required in the business didn't last too long.  But now that original client has found me another guy as well.  So I still talk to this guy.  Like I'm still friends with him and everything.  A lot of I'd say probably two of my old clients.  I went out.  I went over to one of their places.  What was it? Sunday night.  I had lunch with their family.  So I'm still like friends with them.  We're still in talks even though he's just gone a different path in his life.  Sure.  Thankfully from that different path,  I used his connection to be able to get my lawn mowing connection,  another like a lawn to mow at an aged care facility.  So we're all still helping each other here.  Wow. Yeah.  I mean, it pays to not burn bridges and nurture those relationships.  You just got an evangelist.  He's like shouting your name from the rooftops and getting you his replacement.  That is as good of a gift.  Yeah.  Cause it wasn't like it didn't work for them.  It's just bad personal issues that came up and they had to take a different path in life.  And that's sometimes it's just what it is.  Like not much you can do about it.  You can try and I've tried doing this in the past is persuading them elsewise,  but sometimes that change is just what they need to do.  In his case, it was, yeah, a lot of personal family related issues.  So he had to just make that choice of, all right,  for the health of my family,  I have to go this route and step away from the business.  Right.  We are.  No, that's great, man.  And you gained a friend and an evangelist like that.  And I've had a similar situation.  Also hooked me up with his nephew because he was retiring.  The nephew didn't do so well.",

But yeah,  I've been in a similar situation where the guy wanted to retire,  but he didn't want to let go of this cash cow.  And they thought they could pass it on to family,  but the family was too young and too reckless to do anything with it.  Yeah.  It's hard thing is age and stuff,  which sucks because like I'm 22.  So it's basically the people my age and a little bit older,  that at the issues when it comes to running.  That's crazy that you're 22 and you've already gone through, through so much.  I wish I was as seasoned as you are at your age.  I think I was still a student in college, I think when I was 20.  Yeah.  I haven't even done my master's at 22.  I was still a kid or thinking like a kid.  So yeah, I commend you for that, man.  You're dealing with talking with talking to the big boys,  telling the big boys what to do.  That's maturity and leadership for sure.  So great job, man.  22 years old.  I'm very impressed.  Yeah.  I think it helps being in, in that, that trade role, but I'm,  I'm in a trade role with myself as well.  I still got a full-time job that I do want to enjoy.  So being able to talk the same language as them,  I think helps out break down that balance.  Yeah.  Which was just, I think held back a couple of people is they talk  and they just sound like a generic marketing guy that just repeats  what everyone else says.  Right.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  I mean, we're bringing the difference we're bringing.  And I get told that at the end of each and zoom call,  I always ask them,  What made you follow me around and go on with this adventure?  I mean,  I mean,  What made you follow me around and go on with this venture with me?  I'm sure you get in marketing calls all the time.  You've got guys, you know, promising you leads.  Like what, what made the difference?  And they always say it's the approach that we,  we flipped to the approach instead of promising.  We just bring them the job.  I'm like, do you want it or not?  And it's like a,  I mean,  You know,  We make the decision making easy.  So that's what they all say. They say results in advance.  And they say the, the approach, the way.  You show it.  You don't tell me you show me.  And then.  And then.  Yeah, I'll definitely stick with that. That seems to work.  The other thing that I talked about just this morning in another life is.  The way I keep my churn and burn rate low because I have struggled with this  from day one.  People always want to cancel.  Even the people that fall in love with you head over heels, you know,  shit happens in a month later. They're like, yeah, I'm out.  Or their credit card just stops working and you never hear from them again.  So what I do now is I told.  The group in the morning in the life is I always keep four hooks at all times.  If I sell one hook, I have to replace it.  Because that keeps me.  That keeps the standard, the weekly standard.  Because if you lose one hook.  And then you lose",

And some clients that you closed two months ago are already dropping or six  months ago, whatever.  So keeping those four hooks keeps me accountable and keeps me on task.  Is there anything that you do on your end that, that keeps you.  Qualifying has probably been the biggest thing is the harder I qualify and  the more strict I am with it.  Then the longer they're going to last.  Like if I'm strict and I generally have like a, I got three,  three threes is what I call it.  So they have to be three years in business.  They have to have at least three weeks booked out and have to have at least  three, three guys working for them.  The minimum that I kind of try and go by when I follow that everything works  out like they stick around and there's no dramas.  It's when I, if I fall short and say, oh,  they only got one employee,  that's when they can sometimes be issues or if they got less than three years  in business, that's when they can have issues.  Yes. That's kind of what I go by is those three threes.  Okay. Three employees, three years in business.  What's the, what's the other one?  That's just three weeks booked out. That's it.  Three weeks booked out.  Yep. Yes.  I have at least three weeks worth of pipeline that already exists because if  they've got three weeks worth of pipeline, they start tomorrow.  Like I said, three to six weeks is generally what it takes for someone to  close a deal.  So it means their pipeline is not going to be empty and not relying on my jobs  coming through.  It means they have enough work coming through at the moment that's going to  keep them busy until they start landing the jobs.  Yep.  You are smart Levi.  I think you're very smart.  I'm learning man.  I like this.  Three employees,  three years in business and three weeks booked out.  I mean, I asked you stuff anyways, and I like these metrics anyways,  but I never had them in front of me as a standard.  Like this is the parameters that I need to look for.  Set those standards.  Yeah.  And when they're followed, everything works well.  It's when they're not followed and I try and break them.  It's, it's a, it's a gamble.  It's me gambling pretty much.  And it's something I have to ask myself is, am I willing to gamble on this  person?  And sometimes I'm just like, fuck it.  Let's just risk it all.  And I'll gamble on them.  And it will either work out really well or it won't work out.  And I'm, I'm happy to just gamble it and see how it goes.  Sometimes.  I don't know.  I try and believe in people and give them the best opportunity possible.  And some guys have made the most of it.  Like I said, that guy that pays me a thousand dollars a week.  I always going to go back to this guy because he's just one been with me for  over a year now.  And he's gone through all the different processes.  And it was just start off with him and his brother.  And he was, I think, new to business, new to the area.  He had other businesses, which it's kind of what made me say yes.  But I was lucky",

And ended up just driving to his house, catching up with them,  having a chat with them,  told them the price then and there and he shook my hand and said,  let's do it.  That was the whole sales process was just me saying, yeah,  it's going to cost you.  Well, I think it was like $6,000 a month.  And he's like, sweet.  Fucking send over what you need to send over.  We'll get everything started when you're ready.  I like it.  I like it, man.  We've already been on an hour.  Let me see if there's any question here.  Oh, hold on.  Luke said, super inspirational.  What you've been able to achieve, Levi.  Well done.  Question.  The question is,  one of my struggles is getting business owners on the hook  because most trades are so busy.  They are not interested in taking the leads because they are booked out  so far in advance and don't need the additional work.  What is your experience with this?  And have you had,  have you still had success convincing business owners to take the leads  even when they are so busy?  Any tips?  It all comes to the end if they're willing to hire more people.  I think.  If they're not willing to hire more people,  then I just call them as they're not a good fit.  If they're not willing to expand their business and they're happy with  where they are,  I don't want to work with someone that's mediocre.  Otherwise I'm dropping my standards down to mediocre level.  I want to work with someone that wants to fucking make as much money as  possible, take everything, control the whole area, expand here,  do this, do that.  That's the type of person I want to work with.  And when I find someone like that,  we work really well together versus if I find someone that,  if I have to hard sell them and just convince them otherwise,  it shouldn't have to be a hard sell. It should be.  I've got more work. Okay.  So the work I've been coming through now is enough to keep my current team  busy.  But if I can double this workload,  it means I can have another team going.  And if I have another team going,  it might mean I can make an extra 30% revenue for my business or 30% profit  from my business.  And it might be an extra 50% revenue for the business as well.  Yeah.  You mentioned a very good, important thing. Keyword.  It shouldn't be hard to sell because the process sells us.  So yeah, that is a great point. If you're finding yourself,  you know, just spewing sales stuff like this is what we do.  We're awesome. And the leads are this.  And that that's a red flag.  Something is not like if you have to convince them and they already have a  customer in hand,  they're probably not a good fit and it is your job not to flip the script on  them. Start putting pressure. Hey,  I don't want to waste your time if you're busy.  The only reason I'm sending you these because you said you can take on more  work in the initial call. If you remember,  you said you can take on anything I send you. And second,  you're running ads. So that tells me you're not,  you're in growth mode. So, so",

Did you change your mind with why you're being, you know,  a whiny little, you know what, right now,  as opposed to our initial call, you're like, yeah, send all of them.  If you're just in for a couple of leads, I totally get it.  I'm happy to send you more. I just need you to have respect for my time the  same way I have respect for your time. I respect your time.  I respect your time. And if this is not for you, I totally get it.  We're all big boys. I would rather go help someone who needs it.  No harm, no foul. We're all brothers and sisters, right?  So that's what I do. If you find yourself,  Paul, I don't remember who asked the question.  Luke. Yeah. If you find yourself in this situation, flip the script.  You don't need to sell yourself. You, you, you set the lead.  The lead is doing the sales for you.  So instead of selling and getting into that desperate position where,  you know, now you smell like sales breath,  flip the script and ask them, has anything changed since we last talked?  Have you changed your mind? Because if you change your mind, totally cool.  I just need to know so I can move on and go help someone else.  And that's when you rattle them a little bit and they're like, okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.  I didn't say that. I just said that I'm a little busy.  Or they come out of, you know, they come out from behind the curtain.  They say, yeah, you're right. You're right.  I am busy and this is probably not a good time. Great.  Thank you so much for your time. I'm moving on to the next guy.  If this is during like the initial, like trying to hook them, get them interested.  I guess my focus would be finding out like, oh, do you want to hire another team?  If they say no to that, note their name down,  like put them aside because I've called back business owners before like a year later,  six months later, and they're like, yeah, I'm ready pretty much.  And they've said, yeah, some guys don't remember me.  Other guys do remember and they're like, yeah, just it was a bad time.  I was going through this that couldn't go then.  But now I'm ready. I've got another team set up.  Let's let's start this like right away.  Yeah, I asked that too. And then it is in the next script.  You ask how far out they're booked.  And you also ask like a hypothetical question where you're like, OK,  so right now we're not we're not getting any crazy numbers.  But what if we hit like March and we hit a nice stride and now you get double?  Like, what's your plan? Do you have people you can reach out to?  Are you able to hire and grow with the thing?  And that's when they start to project themselves into into that scenario.  Yeah, yeah, absolutely. I have people I can reach out to mark that down.  They have people they can reach out to.  They can grow. They can hire.  And later, if they pull any bullshit on you, you can you can reference it.  Hey, remember what you said last time?  Yeah, well, these people you reach out to.

You got to get the truth from them.  They're going to dance around the truth.  Keep anchoring them until they give you that you get your name.  I hope that. Yeah, I'm very straight up.  And I'll just say I won't give you any bullshit from the start  as long as you don't give me any bullshit from the start.  And it was that doesn't really questions it.  They straight up with me.  And that's how a lot of guys are spilt out.  And they said, yeah, like, I've been in jail and stuff.  Like, that's where I got all that stuff spilling out is when I said,  said that little line.  And it helps them relax a little bit because then they know, all right,  if I'm honest, that means he's not going to bullshit with me  and he's not going to say anything.  And I'm going to show them because a lot of my calls are just like discovery  calls pretty much where I still have to do the research to see if there's jobs there.  Nine times out of ten, there is work there.  But I still do that research just to make sure as well.  Yep. No, I mean, they're contractors at the end of the day.  So they are pretty direct and shrewd.  And it is refreshing for them for you to be straightforward with them  because they deal with, you know, uppity calls and, you know, all kind of formal stuff.  And that doesn't jive with them.  So when you give it to them straight, they kind of respect that.  Relax. They're relaxed.  They're not trying to watch their language.  They're not trying to think about what they have to do next.  I know because I'm in that situation where at work, you know, watch what you say and stuff.  But then if you can just relax and say whatever, it doesn't matter.  Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.  Yeah. Sometimes you just got to let your hair down and, you know, show them the real you.

I told you guys that we are going to be within the next two weeks going  to be talking about search volume, and we're going to be introducing the tool that we are  going to be using going forward, so that we can have a gold standard for search volume.  So keep an eye out for that. Other than that, we're going to we're going to get right into  this with Mr. Jason. I'll read Jason. Thanks for joining us also known as Donnie Dre.

Tell everybody  how much you are doing per month as of today. So I'm doing 13.8 K today. Beautiful. Assuming  I close that other deal, which can't count the chickens before they hatch. So 13.8 K  today should be at 14.8 K. But you know, is that the deal that we're talking about? They  ghosted you? Yeah, yeah. So that one I assumed was closed for some reason. But yeah, unless  you get a payment, don't assume it's closed. That is so true. You have no idea how true  that is. So 13.8 K. When did you start? Just to give everyone a little bit of context.  I bought into your program December or November of last year. But you know, you said that  you really started like actually properly started in January. Like you like actually  got into this in January. Yeah, that's when I really like got my shit together. And I  was like, dude, you have to go all in this. Like, there's no reason why you should be  chasing these SEO deals. So I just went, I just went all in, in January. And yeah, that's  when I really started getting this thing going. So before that, when you were you, I remember  that you were actually you do a little bit SEO. Yeah, yeah. Got it. And that's natural.  What were you doing before? And are you still doing it? I was doing SEO, but I was doing  SEO for before SEO. You were doing SEO before you even joined? Yeah, I was doing SEO for  about probably five or six months before I joined your program. Okay, okay. That's exactly  what happened to me. And sometimes, guys, it's okay. Sometimes you got to pay the bills.  We understand that. But you got to be careful that you do. You don't get stuck, stuck down  the wormhole of SEO. What did you think? Like to you, what was the hardest, the hardest,  what was the biggest or the biggest challenge with running SEO company? Oh, dude, there's  there's so many. Um, so first of all, I had quite a few female business owners, and I'm  not trying to like discriminate at all. But they literally wanted me to change the look  of their website almost every other day. I was spending more time at the desk trying  to make these business owners happy with just the looks of their website, not even getting  them results. Then I was spending at my nine to five job before I quit. So",

    "pageContent": "I felt like  I kind of just had this dream of walking away from the nine to five, but I walked straight  into this other prison cell basically. And it just wasn't working out for me. Yeah, that's  a tricky thing to happen to me. There's nothing wrong with SEO. There's nothing wrong with  using SEO to quit your job. But like for me, it was a prison cell because I never felt  confident that the money was going to be there. Yeah. And we made this hilarious or not we  Isaac did. He made this hilarious like meme of like, yeah, it's, it's oh, it's not Owen  Wilson. It's Tom Hanks or whatever. It's like when you're at SeaWorld and your $4,000 a  month client quits. And I was literally at SeaWorld and on like a vacation and we're  making around eight to nine top line. One of my clients was $4,000 a month. And that  person called me in the middle of SeaWorld. And I just knew when I saw the phone ring  that I was toast. And man, what a what a bad experience when you're about to go on a vacation  paid for by the client and they're telling you they're done. So that was when I was like,  I have to get out of this. That was that was mid summer 2019. And that's if you guys put the  timeline together was the end of 2019 when I really like almost quit doing this business,  which is funny because I really didn't even give this a proper chance. But anyway, long story  short. Yeah, and then tell us really quick, like what are some of the niches you're you don't have  to tell us everything. But what are some of the different niches that you're in?  I just listened to your advice and went straight into the tried and true. I'm still doing that.  Most of my deals are in concrete. Some of my deals are in tree service. The one I closed on  Sunday is is in tree service. I got a few niches that that I feel like have potential that I haven't  shared with people. But you know, that's for for another conversation. If I get 200,000 K,  I'll share it with you guys. So, you know, it's funny is an Aaron can tell you guys this is true.  Well, first of all, we just got Sanchezca. You guys probably saw the post just got a $1,700 a  month deal in artificial grass. This was on this is yesterday, actually. And she might have got it  on yesterday or Sunday. Anyway, so that's artificial grass. That's a tried and true niche. And then she  just found a really good area for concrete. And Aaron, you can even tell everyone I'm not lying  here. When I heard the name of the city, which you're not going to say, you better not say I  told I said now I don't believe it. You remember I said this is yesterday. I was like, now we're  gonna pull up some rush. Yeah, I was like, now we're not doing there's no way that area is open  for concrete. And because the city is really well known. And he's like, No, I've even looked at it  myself. And she started reading me the CPC. And she's like, I didn't believe it either. So for  those of you that are just like, Oh, my gosh, concrete's done or artificial grass down or  fencing is done. Okay. Keep complaining. So that's one of the questions I am going to actually I'm  going to jump to that one. Because it's crazy that you we can have the",

And for some reason, Jason's at $13,800 per month. And there's people  that are at zero that are sending me messages. And Aaron does this because he works with me directly.  There's people sending me messages that probably aren't on this call, because they're probably  busy thinking of excuses. But they're they're just blaming me, the training, the world,  the recession, the the the the rocks and the universe. And they they aren't making any money.  So I guess I'm going to jump towards near the end of one of the questions I was going to ask you,  which is, like, why do you why do you think you're having success? Or let me ask this one,  why aren't people having success that you are the same success that you are?  That's a good question. I, I think there's a lot of people who are  doing a lot better than I'm doing. I mean, wasn't  Yeah, but I'm saying for everyone else, and I appreciate your humility, but and there are people  that are crushing it. But you've also just kind of started. Right. Why? Why? Why are there some  people that are at zero right now? Or that are like, it's the most hardest thing to comprehend  how to get a deal? Like, why? It's the same thing. I can't figure it out.  Yeah, I understand the question. They're just not taking imperfect action. You have to take the  action. If you're not going to pick up the phone and call a business owner, and at least learn off  of that call from the very get go, you're not going to go anywhere. And Nick told us from the  very beginning, follow his step by step process. And you will close deals. So what I did is I went,  I created my Google ads, I generated leads. Next thing I needed to do is, okay, now I need to go  and learn how to hook a business owner. And I literally just followed your steps, Nick.  Next thing I knew I was on a closing call with a business owner.  Just not imperfect action, in my opinion. What do you think, Aaron?  I mean, I agree. Like, you talked about it before, you have the end goal.  You just got to do the steps that lead up to it. I mean, that's it. It is an equation.  I agree. I mean, I agree. That's definitely, that's 100% a part of it. I'm trying to think  if there's anything else. But it is bonkers from my perspective as somebody. And I remember, guys,  I hope you know, I remember being the person that was at zero, watching other people make money.  And when I'm not making money, instead of just owning it, it's so easy as a human to make excuses  and to try to blame everybody else and go, well, yeah, but those people don't have full-time  doorknocking jobs. Those people don't have kids. Those people this, those people that,  and then all of a sudden you want to start like, just pretending it doesn't work and you look for  excuses for why it doesn't work instead of just thinking, maybe I'm the freaking problem.  And then finally you hit this point, for those of us that are finally pull our heads out,  is for me, I remember seeing people post deals and I would get so pissed off and not in a jealous  way. Finally, I was just like, I would, I would see a deal",

And I was like, if that person could do it, then I, and I hope you guys, when you see me,  the fact that I'm, I really, really, really am a very average person. It should inspire you that  anybody can do this. Because if you knew me, if you knew where I came from, if you knew the school,  I went to, if you knew my testing scores, dude, I'm not Mr. Like super smart. I think I'm just  Mr. Persistent and that's the truth. So I do agree though, imperfect action. Those of us that are  willing to be, to look stupid. I heard Jesse Insler say this on like a short the other day,  it's like the moment that you gave yourself permission to feel stupid is the most freeing  thing ever. And the problem is some of you guys want to look so cool and so tough and it's like,  dude, just pick up the phone. Everyone's going to say some stupid stuff. I've said things on calls  that I'm like, Oh, that was bad, dude. You know, and I have dude. So anyway, okay. That said guys,  Jason, why did you actually get into this industry? So what, like, what are you trying to achieve with  this business model? Why did you get into rank and rent specifically? What was the thing that  you're like, you know, for like, just for giving an example for me, I wanted to be able to travel  and like, make his like, make internet money that I wasn't tied to one location. That was the biggest  thing for me. What's the reason that you got into, you know, this vehicle?  Yeah, mine are pretty similar to yours, Nick. When I first branched off and just burnt the ships and  started doing SEO, I, me and my wife created a vision board and we had all of these things  planned out. Like I promised her I would take her to all of these, these places to visit and stuff  like that. And my family was like, you know, bragging about their second vacation of the year.  And I hated that so much. I was like, dude, I'm not just going to save every year and try and go on  one vacation once a year. That's the stupidest thing ever. So we made goals where we are going  to travel whenever we want. And that's kind of what we're shooting for. But I also want to build  my dream home. I want to watch my kids take their first steps. I want to watch my kids say their  first words and working a nine to five job or even just spending all day in the office  isn't going to cut it for me. I want to be able to step outside and do things on my own terms.  So really, I just want a simple life, to be honest, and get paid in my sleep.  Pretty simple, to be honest.  I love that, dude. It's kind of like, what was I just listening to? I can't remember. I heard  something similar. But like, as you were saying, I was thinking, like, instead of, instead of just  living a life where you're just living for your next vacation, like, I don't, this just probably  sounds cheesy, but like, you can actually make your life a vacation in the sense that like,  you every day, and I kind of feel like I'm not completely there, but I'm close because  I have done, I have been so many places this year.

I've been to Paris Fashion Week. I've been to Dubai.  I just was in Miami. I've been to LA. I've been to San Diego. I've been to Africa. I'm going to  Dubai again. I'm going to Daffer. I mean, and always just business as usual. It's just because  I want to, and I can, and why not. So, but here's the cool part, guys, is like, you don't have to  want to travel. Some of you guys don't want to travel. And that's completely cool, too.  Some of you guys want to sit at home and mow your lawn and put, you know, garden gnomes in your  front yard and, you know, drink sweet tea and all that stuff. And that is a cool life as well.  But you get to design it how you want to design it. So I was just curious for you what, what it  was. So that's awesome, dude. By the way, I'm curious, did you grow up like that? Or was it  like you grew up dad nine to five and that's why you feel like maybe that's why you want it's  because it's not what you had or is what you had and you want it as well? No, really. I grew up,  my family has worked the same job their entire life. So my dad started a cabinet company  and they all just work their same nine to five job. They, they look at it as job security and  they actually, you know, were like, dude, Jason, what the heck are you doing, bro? Like you're  getting scammed. You're paying somebody to teach you. Why not go get a college degree, if anything,  you know, that, that mindset that so many of the people in the country have, which is  complete BS, in my opinion. But really, it's just like, I don't want to be like everybody else.  I want to live a life on my own terms. You know, hearing people talk about, yeah, like their,  their first vacation of the year and, and they're all talking about how they're looking forward to  their next vacation 12 months from now. It just doesn't sit right with me. Like I want to be  taking phone calls on the golf course. I actually just went and bought some golf clubs just so I  can go in and just get into golfing because that's something I've always wanted to do,  but never had time. So, uh, so yeah, for you, bro. Um, for some reason, making money  on the golf course is a special money. It's, it slaps different. My first, my very ironically,  my very first money from this business was on the golf course. I've shared the story.  I was on this golf course. I remember everything. It was, it was, I know it was summer. Um, it was  about mid summer. It was 2000 is actually early. This is, I, this is before, I think it's even,  no, this is after that sidetracked. Maybe it was before, but anyway, it wasn't much. And it was a,  it was, everything was wrong. It was a paperly deal, but I was on a, a South gate golf course  and, um, I was on the second, I was in the, I was on hole 10, the back nine. I hit a really good  drive, which never happens.",

I just, how much I remember seven iron and all of a sudden I heard this noise  on my phone or I hit, I don't know. I hit my second shot and I checked my phone and I was like,  dude, I just made a hundred dollars. And it was just a hundred dollars, right? Cause I was getting  paid per phone call. And, um, I remember being like, dude, I've made it. And that a hundred  dollars was so much better than I felt. I think that a hundred dollars was sweeter than the  million dollars I made in 2020. It's, it's a, it's the golf money's different, bro. So yeah, good,  good choice. Good choice. I love it. Okay. Let's talk about the last deal that you closed really  quick. Um, how much, what was the niche? How much like, so how much was it for thousand dollars,  thousand dollars per month, thousand clean thousand dollars, uh, concrete. No tree service.  This one's tree service. Okay. Tree service. I was supposed to have closed too in that same night,  but that one person slipped away. So. Gosh dang it. And there's still a chance, but yeah,  I would just write it off mentally. Um, how much did you spend on ads to how many leads did you  send them? So these guys, I ended up sending them five total. Uh, one came through actually,  no, it was four, four total. And on the closing call, I let them know. I said, Hey, one just  barely came through, assuming that we move forward together. Then I'll hand it over. It's not no big  deal, bro. That's a great thing to do, by the way, if you guys have a closing call scheduled,  you feel like they've, they've either closed the deal or they're interested. Use that as,  as a carrot. Don't just go ahead and give it to them before the call. Say, Hey, I actually,  Hey, I'm looking forward to our call. Um, where you're good to go. Right? Yeah. Okay. Cool. Awesome.  By the way, I had this really juicy lead that came in. And once we figure something out,  I'm going to hand it over to you as well. Like just that little incentive, don't go and send it to  them, you know, um, without using it as a carrot. So, um, and how much do you spend? You sent them  four or five total. Once you got the deal, how much did it cost you to get those five?  It's over a hundred bucks. So actually I started the campaign two weeks ago. Uh, this campaign's  been killing it. Like I struck a real good area. The due diligence was awesome. Uh, I actually had  four leads coming in four days. I had a business owner hooked, got him on a closing call. Uh,  wasn't able to close him because I missed one of the steps, but, uh, he just didn't have money.  Really? He really wasn't somebody who I could really work with. Anyways, a lead comes in the  very next day, got another business owner hooked. And I think four leads came in the very next four  days. So this thing moved so quick, uh, got this guy scheduled. So probably just over 200 bucks  total on this whole campaign had been spent before I closed a business owner. I love it, bro.  Even if you'd spent, I know some people get it",

You had  to do two more, three more ads weren't working guys. Even if it costs you 500 bucks, as soon as  you make that first thousand dollars. And what I do is if I do, I always do weekly, but I try to  on the first payment at the very first month, I try to get the whole payment upfront just to make  sure like I they're good to go and they can pay a thousand bucks. You just recoup all your costs.  And now you made an extra 500 bucks on top of it, even if you spend $500. So don't give up on these,  these deals. Sometimes it costs a little bit of money, but you recoup your costs immediately.  So, um, okay. So you spent about 200 bucks on ads. Um, and, and this campaign went quick and  not all campaigns go quick guys. So don't be like, well, that'd be nice. Yeah, of course.  Some of the other deals you might get a lead today and it might take a week for the second one to  come in. Just don't put yourself in a corner and say, Hey, I'm going to get you four leads in five  days. Just say, I'm going to get you a couple of leads. It's going to take, it could take a few  days. It could take a week or two. I'm just, I want to just let you test a few of these out.  I want to get you really good ones. And then we're going to talk. Is that cool? Just don't  put yourself in a corner with expectations because we can't really control how these campaigns do.  So, and then my other question was going to be how many business owners you go through something  sounds like you went through two, right? Yeah, two total. That one, this concrete one that I just,  you know, I'm still going to, I'm going to put this one on the shelf, but what I did is like,  I kind of get pissed off when people do stuff like that, if I get ghosts or anything.  So I was just like, do you know what, dude, I'm going to go set up two more campaigns.  So I kept that one running, went up, went and set up two more campaigns. So I got two campaigns  running, uh, separate from that other one, just cause I was pissed. I was like, dude,  I'm going to get you back. But anyways, that one, uh, that one's been running for over three days.  I've got three business owners, uh, and it's just, it's just a matter of time before I find  somebody who's hungry because the leads are coming in. So somebody's going to want the  lead. Somebody's going to want to grow. Oh yeah. That's the, that's the right mentality.  And that's also good that you said that because I think some people might hear your other story  about tree service and think like, well, it always goes good for Jason, of course,  but that's not the case. And sometimes that happens. And sometimes maybe out of those three  people he's already been through, maybe the second one he messed up and that should have been the one  he got and he didn't. And now he's got to go. And I will just tell you that my mentality is  that if there are leads coming through, whether it's with add organically, there is always,  always, always a deal to be had. Do not ever give up on it. Whether",

So don't ever  give up on it. Okay. Um, this is an important question. I want to ask you, Jason, what,  what doubts did you have coming into this business? And also not everyone know that  you had to sell your truck to get into this business. Yeah. So when I heard the price,  I was like, Oh shit. I'm like, Oh boy. But I, I, I knew, I knew that it was either this or go back  to the nine to five, to be honest, because, and I was not going back to nine to five. And I,  I've been in this for long enough to realize that, or just in digital marketing in general,  that this business model makes so much sense. I was like, this has to be where it's at.  I control the assets. Somebody walks away from me. I maintain everything. They can't just take what  all of this hard work that I built up and just run off with it. You know what I'm saying? Um,  so the one doubt that I had when I came in wasn't necessarily the price because I knew the business  model worked. It was my capability of selling the deals because I'm not a salesman. I struggle  communicating sometimes. And, um, I was kind of doubting my capability of doing what you did  because with all of your sales experience, um, but I just went in there with, with trust that  you knew you were talking about and got to work. Have you noticed that we don't hardly ever have,  like me and Aaron, we're talking about this. I would say 95% of people that come into this  business, into this group, do not have sales experience. And have you noticed the, the,  how few times you hear people talk about not being able to sell? Aaron, you told me, we knew,  and I talked about this, you remember this? Yeah. What's crazy is that like, I mean, generally  speaking, you think sales is the most difficult part and it's the most important part. It's part  that most people struggle at, but with the specific process of what we do, specifically the  results in advance, it's like it's taken the skill out of sales. Obviously the more skill that you  have, the less reps it's going to take. But again, it is a formula. Like if you do 10 prospecting  calls, you're probably going to get one hook. If you do three hooks, you're probably going to get  one zoom call. If you two, three zoom calls, maybe four, you're probably going to get a close.  So, yeah. 100%. It's, it's amazing because I mean, I've been, I was in these other groups  and nobody could sell. I had to have somebody, somebody DM me just the other day. And from  another course I was part of and they're like, yeah, I gave this business model a go. This person  literally said, I have no problem getting leads and ranking websites. I just can't do the sales.  And I'm like, dude, that's the part in my group, in digital landlords, everybody gets deals.  If anything, it's sometimes finding the right business owner or tweaking the ads or whatever,  but like, we have no problem doing that. So anyway, it's just, it's interesting because when  I started this, that was the biggest issue and we've kind of like removed that entire obstacle.  And it's not",

Family, really creating, creating it, you know, you only live once. So creating a life  worth living for. I don't, I don't want to spend 80% of my life away from my kids. If you include  sleeping and stuff like that, like I want to, I want to spend my time with my family. And I,  you know, I grew up with my, my dad just working all the time. Like, you, you know, he loves you,  but you didn't get to see him very often because he was always working, building his business.  And if I could build my business, maybe even homeschool my kids, like I would love that.  That's something that that's a life I'm striving for just to spend time with my family, to be honest.  Would you say you're driven by like, are you motivated to succeed or are you driven by  insecurity? Oh, I'm motivated to succeed. I, I can now see that I'm capable of reaching  a hundred thousand dollars a month based off of what, you know, like this, I wouldn't have had  this confidence if I had never joined digital networks. If I was hanging out with a free group,  just leeching off of other people, trying to get information out of them, I would have never had  the confidence to figure this out. But because I've practiced what you've taught me and it's  proven to be true. And it's I've seen the results from it. I'm already at $13,000 a month. Like,  where will I be in the next 12 months? I think I could honestly scale this to  30 or $50,000 within the next 12 months. Assuming I bring on the right team. But  well, here's what I look at, bro, is you're at, let's just, I'm going to say to say 14K  to make easy math, but like, this is what happened with me when I got my first deal.  And I remember getting a thousand dollars a month and going, dude, I just have to do that  100 more times. Like, which is a lot, but I saw a clear path. And so like doing what you've done,  I just took a hundred thousand divided by 14,000. Like if you do it seven more times or six more  times, plus the one that you have, like you're at a hundred, you're making money that people go to  school for their whole life and they don't make. And it's crazy. Like it's literally in your hands  to go make a million dollars a year doing, renting piece of crap websites.  It's crazy. Yeah. It's, it almost feels like you're, you're scamming the system, right?  I was talking to a guy the other day. He was saying how he went to school for seven years  for his occupation and he's making $80,000 a year.  And I'm sitting there like, Oh dude, like, honestly, I don't really do anything. Like if I  think about it, like I look at this as a game, I feel like I'm playing a game all day long where  like, I'm like, Oh yeah, I got a lead. Let's go. I call this business owner. And I know that I have  all those value that I'm bringing to the table. And if he tells me, no, I'll just give him kind  of like a smart aleck response and just kind of be",

    "pageContent": "like, okay, that's okay, dude. Like I'll just  call up your competition and just hand it to him. It's no big deal. You know, just to let them kind  of think about it on the way out. Yeah. It's true, bro. Yeah. When you, when you start to see that  there is a clear path, like I think when you get to 10,000 and 1520 and you're like, okay, I think  I can actually do this. It becomes very exciting because for some reason we always think it's for  everybody else, but not for us. And I had this conversation with a friend of mine who's a real  estate agent. And I think he's going to be joining this soon because he's been just kind of seeing  some stuff. He sees I'm always traveling and he's like, he's big in the real estate. He's in Vegas.  He'd been doing this for a long time. He's very serious about it, professional. He does his stuff.  He reads his books. He does. And he's like, he kind of was asking me like, what, what I make  and everything. And he's like, what, what? And you're in Dubai and like all the, you know, and  yeah, dude, it's, and I told him, he's like, wait, so you made seven figures in 2020s. Like you've  made seven figures. And I'm like, yeah. And I told him this, once you make seven figures in a year,  it like changes your identity because you can't make a million dollars and go back to being  less than a million. It's like, you are now a seven figure guy, a seven figure gal.  And come hell or high water, you are going to do it. And guys, since I made that $100,000 a month,  like that's just who we are. Like as a company, as a person, like I will never ever, ever go below  seven figures in a year. Like it just, it's just who I, what I am. It's like my standard has been  raised. And so anyway, dude, Jason, I have no doubt you're going to hit a hundred thousand per month.  But also I want to point out in the air, I'll probably tell you the same thing  is you can tell like when you could tell why Jason's successful because Jason has,  he's got that energy. He's excited. Like if Jason was talking to me about leads,  I would be excited to work with Jason. If Jason was talking to me as a friend about doing this  business model, I would be excited about doing this business model because I can hear the excitement  in his voice. And it's as a reminder guys, sales, the transfer of energy. And some of you guys are  sitting there calling and you sound like you're, I would rather watch paint dry on a wall than  listen to your sorry ass talk about this business. And sometimes you've got to be excited. I tell  Francesca this every time she gets on a phone, on a sales call, because she does the sales for our  agency now, which by the way has been amazing because I don't have to do that anymore.  But I'm like Francesca, just remember sales are the transfer of energy. And if you're excited  about it, they're going to be excited about it. If you're dull about it, they're going to be dull  about it. And so you guys can hear it in Jason's voice. He's so excited about it. He's, it's a game  it's, it's whatever. So that's huge. And some of you guys don't have that",

    "pageContent": "right now and you need  to get that. So, Jason, for time's sake, we're going to cut it right there. I think we need to  do a part two. I think we also should maybe bless everyone in the free group and just do a random  look, go live and let people hear your story. But congrats on your success. I know you're just  getting started. I'm not surprised with your success, but I'm also proud of you, bro. So keep  it up. Thanks, man. Hey, I just wanted to ask you one question real quick. So you played  basketball for Pera one, right? Yeah. What are you going to ask me? Yeah, dude. So I, I played  for Juab and we played against you guys when I was in high school. I think you're a few years  Okay, go ahead. I didn't know that. You know, some other podunk high school, you know,  no, so you're, so you're, you're from Nephi. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So that school is way bigger  than mine, by the way. It's like, I'd way rather be from Nephi. No kidding. Go ahead. Ask me.  Anyways, dude, I'm like, my dude, if, if Pera one's so small, I like went in and like looked at max  preps, you know, like the high school and I like found all the wood brothers and like, dude,  like they were like, you guys were probably the jocks back in the day, weren't you?  Yeah. I mean, we had, what else do you do in Pera one?  That's just awesome. I just wanted to bring that up. Well, I'll say this by the way,  because everyone will know Porter, me, Zach hands down, Porter was the best athlete out of all of  us. So he, you guys, you guys can always bring that up. Porter can always hold that over our heads.  So Porter was definitely, but also just so Porter can be humbled. He also was terrible until he'd  tell about his junior senior year. He was like, dude, is this kid like, it's a little slow, like  mentally, like he was just a little bit of a late bloomer, but he was really good as a senior. So  I was probably the worst out of all three of us. So that's why I'm really trying to take this  making money thing seriously and just kind of put them in their place. I'm just kidding. But yeah,  anyway, so yeah, just long story short, small towns, podunk towns, dude, my high school,  I don't even think it's accredited. I don't think, I think if you went back to the teachers,  not all of them, but there was a couple of teachers, I know they didn't have college degrees.  We had teachers sneaking out in the middle of class, like pretending to go to their car.  We'd catch them out smoking fricking whatever out, like not joints, but like cigarettes and  in the green house, like teachers, students, teacher relationships. I mean, dude, the weirdest  stuff that was like completely normal to me, but completely inappropriate. So if somebody from  high school like me or Porter can make this work. Yeah, dude, you have no excuse or juap. Let's be  honest. Anyway, thanks for coming on, Jason. We'll talk soon. Yeah. See you guys.",

Don't think that there's a certain timeline you have to know the business owner for two weeks or seven days or two months to be able to sell them right and there's proof of this and the reason that I have said that I shared this before.  I used to think you have to know somebody for a certain amount of time for them to be able to trust you right.  But that's not true because we all know those people that we've known our whole lives and we wouldn't trust them with a spaghetti sandwich right and we also know those people that like you meet them and you just know that they're good people you're like dude I just feel like this is a good guy.  So it's not about the time.  It's about the value delivered within the time. Right. So, and when you're first starting you don't think that it's possible like how could I possibly meet somebody today cold call them today.  And then hours later, I'm getting a credit card for a six month contract there's no way and then you realize yeah there is a way.  Every time but you will start to see that.",

    "pageContent": " So Aaron asked the question again, real quick, by the way, hold on who I heard you say somebody's  new who you mentioned that was new Daniel true Daniel welcome to the call.  You're in for a treat and I know Aaron real quick we can make a plug.  We are like, we have committed to quadrupling down on the value and I've said this for about  a month, maybe a little bit longer but yeah there's going to be a lot of.  For those of you that have been around a while, you guys are going to see a huge uptick in.  I don't know if I'd say service or just raw value that we're going to be giving you guys  and so we're talking about this almost every day so anyway, Daniel welcome to call anyone  else that's brand new on this I'm going to try to pull Facebook here I'm going to log  in while Francesca answer this question but welcome to this call.  The purpose is with this is to give you guys, you know, everything that we you need to know  is in the training you could go through the training that could be training.  You don't need me, you could be training plus the community, you have every answer to every  question you could possibly have, however, we try to come on here to give you just that  extra training the the the new updates the this the that the specific nuance questions  because we can never, it'd be impossible to answer every single question but here's the  great part is if you guys ask these questions on these calls, like Aaron's about to ask  Francesca, we're going to cut that a little assuming the answer doesn't suck, Francesca  we're going to cut it.  Just kidding.  And then we're going to put that inside of the Kajabi training so that we can have the  specific questions the nuanced questions as many as possible inside the training.  So if you guys have been in this group, the training changes every single week we literally  have add we add one to three to five new videos every single week I don't know if you guys  continually logging in but we want you guys in there and checking it out.  So that said, go ahead and ask the question let's get into it.  Yeah, absolutely.  So Daniel says, how do you vet these videos instead of just picking the first one?  Yeah, so I think it starts when you're transferring the free leads to them and your live transferring  yourself like that's the first thing that you want to watch out is to the sound professional,  you know, that's the first thing that you really notice and usually that gives you a  pretty good idea.  And then the second one is when you get on a zoom call, also like the follow up like  when you follow up on those leads that you sent over how quicker they do answer the closing  them if not do they have stupid excuses.  So that's another thing.  And then another one would be when you get on a zoom call before you kind of start you  ask them questions like are you looking to grow where are you at gather as much as information  before you even start going into you know wasting too much time and that would probably  be the final thing you do to check it.  You kind of get a pretty good idea after you do all of that to be honest especially after  you close a bunch of them because you get the senses that kind of tell you this is good  this is not good.  Yeah, do you have a couple like specifics real quick on this question like and that  opening cold call obviously this is a little hard because it's a balance if you don't want  to get hung up on but then also you don't want to agree to give them free leads if",

    "pageContent": "they're  not a good fit like what are some telltale signs you look on and that first cold call  of like if they're maybe a good fit or not.  Yeah, I think like breaking that relationship during the cold calling is way easier than  waiting to do the zoom call anyway.  So you if you catch something off I would almost suggest being stricter then because  that way you're not wasting too much time you know because there's always going to be  not always but you're going to have a few more free leads to send someone else at that  point.  I would say like if you transfer I had one I remember I transferred the lead and he  wouldn't talk so I said hello are you there and we're like all he would say was yeah  like introduce yourself like say something and that to me was like okay no like he wouldn't  say you know anything his name nothing even you know you introduce them but still like  you've got to have someone that sounds alive on the other end so stuff like that like you  just kind of feel off I would say that sounds unprofessional or I've had a few like you  transfer the lead they sound good and then when you check in on them and say hey how  did that go did you close them did you give them a quote and they get back to you saying  um I didn't have enough time I have to call them back then you're like okay stuff like  that will make you kind of wonder you'll know yeah for sure and like actually like I added  one quick thing like they got to want leads if they're a cavalier about it you don't really have  that much control if they're like and we're doing pretty good like they could be lying so it could  be a smoke screen so you don't want to address that but like I remember talking with one dude  he was like 55 I don't know what I was thinking homeboy was not ready to hustle for more leads  right and so I didn't really have like any leverage or any control because he didn't care  and so in that situation you like the guys that are hungry to grow again just because someone  says we're doing good doesn't mean they actually aren't hungry and they could get really hooked  by your free leads but that's still something to focus on and you can do the pull back then  like if they act like that and they're like well I'm already and then be like then what did you  agree on getting a few free jobs if you're already great right do you want them or do you not then  you're like you can just be honest with me you know you know I'm a big man you can just tell me  and then they're usually like no that's not what I meant or whatever something done like that  that's usually what they say looks like nick has his hand up yeah um  um machete okay just want to get your attention um funny that aaron said that um the number one  thing in a business owner is a hungry business owner right because they they you're not going  to find that you can't as much as I would love to have every business owner be good at sales  most of them suck like they're they're like old plumber let's say it's in the plumbing industry  for septic right we do submit they're probably an old plumber that decided to open their company  they're not trained in sales not always if you find the one that are that are good at plumbing  and business people those ones are really good typically you don't find that so you have to  remember it's kind of like like I guess so aaron aaron is is is currently single just fyi for any  of the ladies out there um at some point aaron's gonna start freaking working the field aaron's  gonna start hunting you know he's gonna start freaking prowling",

And honestly, I've had some of my best success  doing deals on Saturday morning.  Sounds crazy, sounds weird, but guess what?  A lot of times during the week,  these guys are fricking running their business.  They're not working on their business.  They're working in their business.  So I used to schedule calls when I was actively doing them.  Now we have people in closers,  but when I was actively in 2020, on Saturday morning,  you know what I would do?  And in 2021, Saturday morning,  I would schedule a sales call for 7 a.m.  That's how I wanted to start my weekend.  I wanted to make dough by 8.30.  I had a new credit card on file and boom,  I could enjoy the weekend.  I would close, I had very, very high percentage  of closing on Saturday morning.  So my tip is do it in the morning while they're still fresh  before all the problems have,  they become inundated with problems.  And as a bonus, Saturdays seem to work very, very well.",

It's a  rhetorical question. How does Google actually make money? We see them all over. We know  they're worth billions and billions of dollars. They might even be worth a trillion at this  point. I don't even know. They make phones. I mean, it's such a big company. It's such  a popular thing that it's a verb now. Like, did you Google it? It's actually a verb. But  how do they make money? What is their main revenue source? Well, I'm going to give you  the answer, and that is through this little thing called AdWords, which all of us are  familiar with because we've all dealt with it. We've all spent money on it. We've all  used it and abused it, et cetera. And so the reason I'm bringing that up is you then need  to ask yourself, okay, well, how does AdWords work? Why does AdWords work? Well, AdWords  works because so many people go to Google. They have so many searches that they can charge  for it. Well, why do they have so many searches? Okay, we're just going down the rabbit hole,  but think about it. If you have a question, if you're looking for concrete, if you're  looking to extend your pool deck or you're looking to put in a sidewalk or you're looking  to pour a pad for your basketball hoop for your kid or whatever, right, what are you  going to do? You're going to go to Google and you're going to search concrete contractors  near me or concrete contractors Las Vegas, Nevada or concrete contractors St. George,  right? Why? Because in the past, every time you've searched anything, Google has given  you results that are very, very accurate and they almost know exactly what you're looking  for. And we have gotten so accustomed to, if we have a question, we don't even need  to really type it in correctly. We can honestly just type in a part of a lyric or somebody's  name that's spelled incorrectly or somebody is famous plus their husband and it will pull  it up. Their search engine is so good and is so accurate that we have relied on Google  to answer all of our questions. But for Google to keep charging exorbitant amounts of money  like they do for AdWords, that has to stay true. What does all this mean, Nick? What  this means is Google needs us as customers to trust them. And so they need to put the  top, the people that they put at the top of Google in the maps, in the organic and even  in the ads, they have to be relevant to what people are looking for, aka they need to get  their questions answered. Okay? So what I just need you to wrap your head around is  as you're doing SEO, as you're doing content, as you're doing your ads, as you're doing  everything related to Google, keep in mind how Google makes money. And think about it  as you go to put something on your website, ask yourself is this related to somebody that's  searching for concrete contractors? Would they also search this thing? Somebody that's searching  concrete contractors is probably also searching for how much does concrete cost? Can you pour  concrete in the cold? Top rated concrete contractors near me,",

    "pageContent": "concrete company, right? And there's  all these different things that are related to it. So let's use another example, right?  People that are searching for Kanye West, and I'm using him because right now he's getting  blown up in the media, so it's on top of everybody's minds, okay? If you're, somebody or you that's  searching for Kanye West is also probably searching for other things, right? They might  be searching for Kanye's net worth. They might be searching for Yeezy's. They might be searching  for Kim, right? They might be searching for some crazy comment that he made. And so the  companies that understand this, the companies that write the blog articles and the regular  articles and the pages that talk about all of those things that are the most authoritative  around that subject matter are the ones that are going to win. So when we're doing sites  and we're doing content and we're doing our on page SEO, which we're going to get into  all that, I just need your frame of mind realizing that we need to be the most authoritative.  We need to be all encompassing. If we're talking about concrete contractors, we also need to  be talking about concrete companies. We also need to be talking about concrete cost. That's  why we do the keyword list so thoroughly. And there are some things we don't care about  ranking for, right? We don't care about cheap concrete near me because those are not customers  that we want. But I just want you guys, as you're going through this, if you can drill  this into your head and every time you're about to put something on your page or choose  an anchor text, which all these terms I'm going to get into. If you don't know what  somebody is talking about, it's coming. But I'm just giving you a little precursor. Just  think like Google. Think like Uncle G and for them to continue to charge for ads, which  is their main revenue stream, they have to continue to be trusted. And the way that they  are trusted is because when you search something, they put results at the top that answer your  questions.",

Oh, yeah  Um, I don't do credit cards. I'm just gonna send you a PayPal  I'm sure you take out the PayPal, right?  And I know I've been I've been like it's been a while but I know a couple years ago  I would have said yeah, I guess that's okay. He'd send me a PayPal  You know what you should say and what you're gonna start saying is like no, I don't actually don't unfortunately you could say it  However, you want but unfortunately, I don't take PayPal credit cards the only way I'm not gonna be chasing you around  I got too many people I'm working with this is too my time is too valuable and so is yours  I got to keep a credit card on file. That's a deal breaker. I apologize. I gotta keep a credit card on file  Scariest shit to say right but I promise you they'll respect you and if they're actually sold they give you the credit card  Period. I have a guy I kid you not have a client right now  that he signed a deal before the New Year and  I said I he signed it we're good to go and I sent him a credit card authorization and he said hey  Can I just give you my bank account and dude? I have I hate bank account stuff because then on stripe when the payment declines  It's this whole thing and it takes a while to get paid. I just don't like it. I  Want to get paid today. I said we don't take we don't take bank account. Sorry, and I kid you not  I walked away from that deal. I  Literally told him that like I can't take anything besides a credit card period and  It took another four weeks almost a full month of  Me I just I wouldn't take it and it took four more weeks before I finally got his credit card  He went to the bank and got a card  Just so he could pay for leads. Okay, so he wasn't bullshit. I thought he was lying  He's like I don't have a credit card for this business. I want to put under this business  He wouldn't got a credit card because I just my time is too valuable. I'm not gonna mess with it  So that's an example people are gonna ask. Hey, you know, I don't I don't like giving out my credit card  can I just give you my PayPal or  Or this one you get more often. Yeah, I don't I don't want to have my credit card on file  Can you just send me the invoice?  Wait, will you just send me the invoice? Sorry? I got a itch on that  Well, you guys just send me the invoice every month and I'll just pay it now. Sorry. We just have it  This is how I respond so are we just have it in our system automatically like keep in mind  I'm doing this with 50 60 companies. I can't go in and do this every single month  So I I'll send you the first one as the invoice, but after that it's gonna automatically bill cool  Cuz then what happens is that once they fill in the information, it's gonna lock their card and file and I just I'm straight with them",

    "pageContent": " Okay, guys, welcome to the call.  Today we're going to be talking about sub-nitching.  We've been talking a lot about niches.  We've been talking a lot about picking the right city.  Basically the first step in the process, which I believe is the most important process apart  from the sales and getting the deal and getting people to give you their money, this is the  very most important part of the entire process.  This is one of the, I think, what is the date?  It's August 12th.  We're really focusing in this quarter on this first step, and so if it seems like we're  going very nuanced, it's because we are, and that is because I know when I say it, when  you first hear about this model, it's like, okay, pick a city, pick a niche, rank the  website, rank it out.  Boom, that's the 20,000-foot view, and that is actually true.  However, you'll realize that all the money is in these tiny little adjustments.  It's in that 10%.  It's the difference between making a million dollars a year and making $10,000 a year is  in the nuance.  We are talking about nuance.  Today we're going to be talking about specifically sub-nitching so that you guys can, and so  I'm going to get into what we're going to cover and all that kind of stuff, but we're  going to be talking about sub-nitching inside of picking your perfect niche for whatever  project, whatever industry you decide to go into.  Okay, so hold on.  Can everybody hear me, by the way?  You can hear me, right?  Yeah, you're good.  Okay.  I got another notification that said this meeting was being recorded, so I didn't know  if that was an error or what.  Okay, guys, what I'm going to do, give me one second.  I'm going to just open this window.  Hold on.  Get some light in here.  Okay, you can still hear me, Aaron?  Absolutely.  Beautiful.  Okay, Aaron's going to be in charge of letting people in.  He's also going to be in charge of kicking people out.  He's going to be in charge of comments, questions, et cetera, and I'm going to leave time for  questions because I think that we've gotten in the last, this is our sixth week doing  this, right, Aaron?  Yeah, that our seventh.  Okay, this is our seventh.  It might be.  I got to count.  Okay, sixth or seventh, and we have had really, really good questions from these groups because  basically what these groups consist of is the people inside of the free group, the ones  that are actually serious about taking actions, the ones that actually want to go and make  some money and do something and don't just want to listen, they want to apply.  We have had really, really good questions that we're going to save some time for, okay?  Want to remind everybody that if you guys keep your cameras on and stay to the end,  we're going to take everything that we covered today and we're going to turn it into a digital  resource and we're going to just DM you guys from Donnie Dre.  He's going to DM you the digital resource.  I'm not going to have to comment anywhere, poke, whatever.  You're going to just automatically get it by staying on this call till the end and keeping  your camera on.  Okay, so that's number one, and what we're going to do is at the end, Aaron is going  to screenshot everybody",

We're not trying to be weird, but we want to make sure that the people that are on are  actually on and we have that good energy, we have that good participation when it was  having a bunch of dead weight.  Okay, I'm a big fan of not having dead weight.  That's the whole reason that we're doing this on Zoom rather than doing it in Facebook,  okay?  So that said, guys, let's get into this really, really quick.  Aaron, does it look like we have anybody new?  In fact, what I want to do as we get started, I want to know really quick, is there anybody  in the comments, is anybody ... No, actually, it's what I want to do.  In the comments, I want to know how many calls you've been on since we changed the format.  Since we went to doing Zoom calls, these intimate Zoom calls, I want to know how many calls  have you actually been on?  Is this your first put one, if it's your third put three, if it's your fifth put five, if  it's whatever.  I want to know really quick, and then Aaron, I want you to start reading and let me know  so I kind of have an idea how many calls everyone's been on.  Yeah.  This is the second one for Todd, first one for Trey, first one for Christopher, fourth  for Shane.  He's been with us for a while.  Jaleel, it's the second one, Jen's the third, Elden's the first, Jose's the first, Theo's  the third, and then Matthew's likely my eighth, so yeah, Matthew's been hanging with us.  So yeah, we got a couple people though for their first.  Is that Matthew Torres?  Yeah.  Okay, girl, dope.  So I was going to actually ... My next question was, and going to let everybody know, any  of you, I think there's one or two I heard, maybe just one, maybe it's Matthew, but if  you are in digital landlords, you are going to get these recordings regardless.  I'm glad you're on these live because I think it's good.  You can ask questions, whatever, however, you're going to get these recordings inside  of the training material as well.  So just heads up.  Okay.  The reason I wanted to ask is I wanted to know how familiar people are with me.  So really, really quick, I like to start every call with a one-minute synopsis of just my,  I guess my pedigree, my credibility here.  I don't think you should listen to anybody on the internet personally.  I think you should assume everybody's full of crap, but for what it's worth, my name's  Nick Wood.  I've been doing this since 2016.  I had a little nine-month period where I chased shiny pennies.  I lost a bunch of money doing software or trying to do software, and it woke me up and  showed me just how good this business model was.  And sometimes you have to lose everything to realize what you have, which is true in  every single facet of life.  That's what happened to me.  And out of necessity, I either had to get a job to pay for my bills and take care of  my family, or I had to start doing this.  And I choose this every single day of the week.  Anyway, I lost a lot of money.  I've spent over about a million and a half dollars on Google ads alone.  I went $60,000 in debt.  I've had companies go bankrupt on me",

    "pageContent": "that owed me $15,000 plus.  I've hired and fired the wrong people.  I've gotten office space, and I shouldn't have gotten office space.  I made it through COVID.  I have almost quit twice.  I've gone into the wrong niches.  I've gone into the wrong sub-niches.  I've built over 200 websites, half of which were in the wrong niches.  I have done just about everything wrong that you can imagine.  And also, on the other hand, in 2020, I finally figured this out.  I figured out how to scale.  I figured out the missing pieces of this business model.  And we scaled this business to $100,000 per month, and we haven't looked back since.  Just over seven figures in 2020 did over $1.4 million in 2021.  And then we haven't looked back since then as well.  And I tell you that so that as I'm talking to you, you're not sitting here going, who  is this guy?  Is this another person that's just talking?  You should assume that.  But I want you to also know that I don't speak, for example, today what we're talking about,  this is all going to be from experience.  And I'm going to go over kind of our game plan of what we're going to be talking about  here in just a moment.  And so you guys have an outline.  But this is only from experience.  And if I haven't done it, I'm going to tell you, and I do this because this is what I  wish that I had.  I wish that somebody who was basically five years ahead of me or millions of dollars ahead  of me could have been on a live and I could have asked them questions.  I could have asked them about this niche and that niche and what do you think about this  and what about running ads and what about scaling and who do you hire?  What about outsourcing and all these different things that I never knew.  And I would ask these questions, guys, to these groups that I was a part of.  But nobody in these groups had done what I wanted to do.  And I'm a huge proponent, a huge believer that if you have not done what I want to do,  I cannot listen to you.  I'll listen to you out of respect if I have to come in the room with you, but I'm not  going to take your advice.  OK, I'm not going to take advice from a trainer who doesn't have the body that I want.  I'm not going to take advice from a financial planner who doesn't have the the bank account  that I want and the investment portfolio that I want.  I'm not going to take marriage advice from somebody that doesn't have a thriving marriage,  somebody that I'm not going to do that.  And so I want you guys to know, as I'm talking on this call, I am somebody that's done this  and I've now trained over six hundred and seventy people to do this, one of which, Mr.  Ryan Dalton, who just barely got into this two years ago, I'm happy to say, is making  over seventy five thousand dollars per month.  I think is absolutely incredible.  He's also got two kids, a wife, a dog, hobbies and everything else.  So any excuse that you have for why you can't do this is an excuse.  OK, that's just the truth.  When I started this, it wasn't good time.  OK, it's never good timing.  I'm just going to let you guys know if you haven't started and you're waiting for the  perfect time, then hop off the",

It's never good timing to get married, never good timing to have a kid, never good timing  to start a business or to take that opportunity or do anything.  And you're going to realize that you only get a couple of chances in life to like good,  good chances of opportunities.  And if you don't get in the habit of taking advantage of those, then you're you're you're  going to look back with regret.  And if you think that the timing is going to be perfect, you're crazy.  OK, when I started this business, I was knocking doors full time.  I had it. I was managing a team of 20 people with with a friend of mine.  So every single day I was knocking doors during the day, doing meetings until nine,  ten at night. And then I was working on my business during the day or sorry, during the  night. That was my that was my schedule.  So anybody that's sitting here saying I don't have time, whatever, whatever, whatever,  that's not true. OK, so guys, the goal today, my promise to you guys for you guys today  is that I'm going to give you guys enough knowledge on sub niching that you're going to  have the confidence to go into big, hairy, scary niches in a sub niche with a sub niche  angle. And you're going to do so without being worried.  You're going to do so without thinking that you're just going to lose your shorts and  you're going to do so very, very confidently.  That's my promise. The plan today, kind of the outline of what I want to cover over the  next 20 minutes before we get into Q&A is number one, I want to talk about what is sub  niching. OK, number two is I want to talk about why I think you should always err on  the side of sub niching, even with the non-competitive niches.  And I'm going to get into that throughout this.  OK, I also want to talk about how my screw ups led me to figure out sub niching and  they forced me to figure out sub niching.  I'm going to give you guys some examples on sub niching.  We're going to talk about how there's always a sub niche angle, easy ways to find sub  niches. And finally, I'm going to give you an example of one of my sub niche websites.  And then we're going to do some Q&A.  OK, so that said, I want you guys, if you have questions, I want you to start dropping  them right now because I am going to go rapid fire, get through as many as possible.  Last time we did a really good job and we got through a ton of questions.  I don't think there was any question that we didn't get through.  So, Aaron, while I'm turning down the AC, like I always do and I forget to do, will  you please see if there's any comments really quick?  Give me one second. All right is.  Think we should all invest in an auto air conditioner adjuster app or something for  that, because literally every single week.  But, you know. OK, was there any comments?  No, we're ready to just get to it.  Let's do it. OK, let's do this thing, guys.  So let's talk about sub niching really quick.  I'm not going to waste time on stuff.  It doesn't matter. Sub niching is taking a big niche and going into something that is  more narrow. OK, it's it's and we always",

    "pageContent": "hear the riches are in the niches.  And that is true.  And the thing that you don't realize when you get into this is everyone thinks of like  these big niches that are top of mind, HVAC, roofing, plumbing, solar, blah, blah,  blah, blah, blah. Right.  Everyone has I get if you know how many times someone's messaged me and said, hey,  what do you think about getting solar leads or what about this?  I would be very, very, very rich, very rich because everyone asks the same questions.  And the truth is, as I've said before, you can get you can get leads in any niche.  I've got them in assisted living.  I've got assisted living leads.  I've gotten golf lesson leads.  I've gotten cactus removal leads.  I've gotten the weirdest type of leads you could ever imagine.  You can get leads.  I've got them in alarm systems.  We've got them in tax tax returns, CPA stuff.  The the thing is, it's not black and white.  Which is the case with anything in life, right?  It's not are you going to get leads or not?  You will get leads. It's how many leads?  How how how is the juice worth the squeeze?  And so no matter what industry you go into, eventually you do enough of what we teach.  You're going to get leads.  The question becomes, is it the best use of time?  And so some of these big, scary niches, these roofing, these these  plumbing, these, you know, these bigger ones, everyone wants to mention,  even like electrician, whatever.  They're not the move.  They're not the move.  They're landscaping.  They're too, too, too, too, too competitive.  However, if you go sub niche, there's a lot of money.  And so what I want to say is, yes, there's money in there's riches in the niches.  But in my opinion, you know, I've said this, I said this last call.  There's there's riches in the the niche cities or the boring cities  or the cities that no one thinks about.  Right. And the boring niches.  But there's also a lot of money in the sub niches.  And so that's what we're going to be discussing today.  So some niche is basically just an offshoot of a niche.  So think, for example, we'll give you I'll give you an example.  Roofing and roof repair.  OK, roofing is the general niche.  There are companies that do roofing like they go and they do roof replacements.  That's where the big money's at for a lot of these companies.  I have a buddy that's making millions of dollars in Myrtle Beach.  A friend of mine, I know from Africa, actually,  and he grew up here as well, making millions of dollars doing roofing.  There's a lot of money in roof replacements.  Insurance pays for it.  It's you know, it's an expensive thing, but it's competitive, man.  It's very, very, very, very competitive.  There's also a lot of money for us in roof repair.  And for these companies, roof repair is not the thing necessarily that everyone wants.  It's not the thing that everyone desires.  But a lot of these companies, when things get a little bit slower,  they want to be able to keep their guys busy.  They want to be able to send their guys out, even if they don't make that much money.  They want to be able to send their guys out, fix a",

They pay their guy.  They keep them busy while the jobs are coming in.  There are other companies, the smaller guys that will typically take on  just roof repairs, and they're almost more of like a roof handyman.  So anyway, that is what subnitching is.  OK, second thing I want to talk about, and by the way, Aaron,  if you have anything you want to add on any of these points, please let me know.  OK, sounds good.  OK, yeah, like actually real quick, dude, on that, like this was like a year ago  when I first got in the game, totally candid.  I did not end up I this was a I partnered with the dude  and we were doing like some crappy GMB.  He had didn't end up working out in terms of getting a deal.  Like I got a deal for like two weeks, totally collapsed  because the GMB got suspended.  Bottom line, the moral of the story for this context,  I was talking with this roofer dude.  This is like some 50 year old dude, a solo guy who's making bank  because he's charging like 900 bucks to like put a tarp over her roof repair.  So like I firsthand know like roof repair.  It's insane because he's like, honestly, put a lot of times  just put a tarp up and the customer is happy anyway.  Crazy good.  The thing I've learned about this, like talking about subnitches  and all these things is that man, anything that is.  The obvious stuff is never where you want to be  because the obvious stuff is what everyone's doing, right?  And so it always comes down to like, what's everyone doing  and how do I do something different?  Right. Everybody wants to get roofing leads. Right.  Cool. No one wants to go do roof repair leads  because it's not you don't get talked to the big companies and blah,  blah, blah, blah, blah.  But anything that nobody wants to do, there's money in. Right.  There are people right now.  That's what I've learned as I've started to travel the world.  I've met people from tons of different countries,  tons of different ethnicities, tons of different industries.  Guys, I know millionaires in the most weirdest industries  you'd ever imagine in your life.  I know a guy that's very wealthy.  I don't know exactly how wealthy, but this guy is he's a Lebanese guy,  but he's from he's from Sierra Leone, actually,  but he's he throws you off. He's Lebanese.  And this dude is making his money.  By taking garbage, taking plastic,  and and he figured out a way to turn it into cement blocks.  And he's basically it's like 30 percent cheaper. Right.  So instead of just producing seem like a lot of people in Sierra Leone,  they'll go and they'll start an import company. Right.  They'll go and import stuff from Lebanon and import stuff from Turkey.  They'll import stuff from China.  And then they'll they'll sell it to the builders.  They'll sell it to whatever. Right.  And that there's people that make a lot of money doing that.  And it's what this guy did is he's like, hey, instead of going  and doing what everybody else did, I'm actually going to go  and I'm going to I'm going to",

    "pageContent": "do building materials,  but I'm going to create a building material out of all the filth on the ground.  And he's he's become very, very successful doing that.  He also has a separate business that he started  where they take I don't know how else to say that they take shit,  human shit from the dump sites.  And they put it in these bags and they literally like  turn it into fertilizer and he sells the fertilizer. Right.  So instead of you could look at the overarching niche being,  you know, garbage collector or waste removal.  And he's gone sub niche and he's he's producing fertilizer. Right.  What I'm getting at is that there are always I think that the move,  no matter what you're doing,  you always want to look for the opportunity to sub niche.  And I don't care if even if you're not in lead generation,  let's say that you do this business, you go and you make ten thousand bucks,  you quit your job, you maybe you make twenty thousand bucks a month.  It allows you to travel and you decide at twenty thousand bucks.  You're going to kind of stop there  and you're going to go pursue some other businesses.  I think you're crazy, but you could.  And, you know, whatever business you get into, I don't care what industry  this is going to be applicable.  I truly, truly, truly believe that no matter what industry  this is going to be applicable for that.  OK, so let me give you an example really quick.  And one thing I want to say is that you do need to make sure  that the volume is adequate.  So you want to go and you want to be sub niche down,  but you have to make sure that the volume is adequate.  Does that make sense?  So, for example, if you're going to go into roof repair in  Las Vegas, Nevada, you need to make sure that even though that's a sub niche,  you need to make sure there's enough volume,  because as you start to go into sub niche,  you're going to start getting less volume than the main niche.  So as long as the volume is adequate, which that's another conversation  for another day of how to discover volume.  That's one of the things we talk about inside the program.  But as long as the volume is adequate, you can never go wrong by sub niching. OK.  I'm going to give you an example that's a little bit outside of this realm,  but it worked amazing.  So in 2021, I started my program, Digital Landlords,  and this is applicable because who knows, maybe one day you guys have your own  programs, maybe not, but this was this is very, very on point. OK.  So I got some coaching from somebody.  This is what I always do.  Whenever I want to do something new, I go find the expert and I pay them.  And in this case, I paid somebody, I think it was ten thousand bucks.  And they had this training that basically showed me how to A to Z, set up my,  you know, how to launch my program.  Imagine they're selling a program on how to sell a program.  What a genius thing to do. But I bought it. It was ten thousand bucks.  I bought it.  And one of the things that this person said is make sure to go niche,  make sure to go very, very, very niche and speak to your exact audience  that you think you're going to be solving the problem for.  And so that's what I did.  And so many of you will never remember this, but when I first started  my",

    "pageContent": "program, I called it flat fee mastery. OK.  And the reason I called it flat fee mastery is because at that time,  all the people that I knew, all the people that I knew  that were in this business from other groups, they were people  who had already been in other programs and they knew how to build a website.  They knew how to generate leads.  They just didn't know how to sell.  And specifically, they didn't know how to sell a flat fee deal.  They couldn't even fathom selling a flat fee.  I was getting messages all the time, dude, I can't get anyone  to do anything besides commission.  How are you selling flat fee deals?  So I'm like, dude, I'm going to be teaching people who are already  in other programs, and I'm just going to be teaching the sales side.  I'm not even going to be talking about the SEO.  I'm just going to be talking about sales.  And I'm going to be talking specifically about how to do flat fee.  And so guess what, guys?  I called my program flat fee mastery.  And guess what?  Our free group up until two weeks ago, I think.  When do we change the name of the free group, Aaron?  Just two weeks ago.  Yeah.  A week ago, two weeks ago.  It was called the art of pre-selling.  What does that even mean?  That doesn't even make sense to anyone.  Like, I was the worst name for a group to try to attract people  into this business that have never done it.  The art of pre-selling makes no sense.  It makes total sense, though, if you're already in the business  and you are like, you know, you've built websites,  you've waited six months and you're frustrated, right?  But because I thought I was talking to an audience  that had already been in the space, I didn't care.  Point being, guys, I targeted.  Let me tell you how narrow I went.  And, you know, the first like snitch is I went not just into general business,  but I went into marketing, right?  So there's all kinds of different business and then there's marketing.  But I didn't just go into marketing.  I went into, you know, lead generation specifically  inside the umbrella of marketing, lead generation.  And inside of lead generation, I went into local lead generation.  And inside of locally generation, I went into locally generation using organic.  And inside of that, like there were so many levels.  And inside of that, I went into  specifically flat fee  lead generation by building.  I mean, I was so niche that in my head, I was terrified  because I thought I was going to exclude all these people by going that niche.  And guess what, guys, I did the exact opposite thing.  And when you become when you go niche.  You become the expert, OK?  We've all heard, like, for example,  right now, I'm looking at investing in some property in another country.  And I am having the hardest time  finding somebody that's an attorney or a CPA, not an attorney, a CPA  that specializes or has knowledge and experience  on real estate in another country, specifically in West Africa.  OK, and more to come on that.  But if any of you guys have any ideas of somebody, don't waste my time, please.  But if you do, I'd be really grateful.  The only person that we found, we found one person and they charge  some insane amount of money.  I think it was over a thousand dollars per hour  to just consult, just to consult over some",

Like, I just need you to tell me if I can depreciate this and if it's the same  and how it's going to look and all this different stuff.  And and and that's that's what happens, guys.  When you become the expert in tiny sub niches,  that's where all the money is. OK, so I would love to see somebody  because I see people all the time on the roofing local.  I'm the lead generator leads for roofing.  I know I haven't seen roof repair lead generator.  OK, I haven't seen that.  I have not seen the roof repair lead generator.  And the reason why is because people are too scared to go sub niche.  But that's where all the freaking money is. OK.  So, Aaron, anything you want to add to that?  No, it's on point. OK, let's keep going.  Real quick, I'm not going to waste too much time on this.  But the reason I got into this, guys, is because I was an idiot.  That's what most most of the stuff I teach you guys,  most of the stuff I've learned is come by me being an idiot  and doing the wrong thing.  And basically what happened to cut a very long, multiple year,  multiple millions of dollars mistake  is I went into industries that were massive and got my butt kicked.  I went into roofing.  I went into I tried alarm systems.  I went into CPA.  I went into a space and waterproofing water.  Oh, my gosh, I got my butt handed to me  out of silver platter and waterproofing foundation repair right there with it.  Landscaping, all of the stuff.  I wouldn't even I wouldn't even waste my time doing a due diligence  on any of these niches.  Like I wouldn't waste five seconds on any of this stuff.  And I built tens.  Of in each of these niches, probably.  I'd say probably over 50 sites in those niches I just mentioned combined.  No more, because just in waterproofing the foundation repair alone, about 50,  I would say close to 100.  In the wrong niches, in these big niches.  So just so you guys know, you don't have to believe me.  You guys can go and see if the stove is hot yourself, because I understand  that's what you have to do sometimes.  But even if you can get that city and you can get that partnership  and you're like, no, I figured it out, guys, we're talking about scaling.  And guess what?  I've also had one or two good partnerships in these industries.  But the point is, it's not repeatable.  It's not something that I can duplicate.  And that's the issue.  OK, so that's that's really the reality is that you guys can either listen  to what I'm saying or you can go try it yourself.  And hopefully you guys are smart enough that you can look at my mistakes and go,  all right, let's just listen to Nick.  OK, that's why I wanted to start off by telling you my my experience  so you didn't have to go touch the stove yourself.  OK, a couple of examples of stub niches.  You know, we could talk about instead of roofing,  we could talk about roof repair instead of landscaping.  There's landscape design instead of electrician.  We could I don't even know what the term for this is,  but you could target just",

Sorry, I got a quote on both houses  and realized my house was already equipped for it because I had an RV garage.  But I've literally called.  I've gone to Google and typed in like Tesla  electrician for Tesla charger electrician for electric car.  Do you know what that's called, Aaron, that conversion process?  I do not. OK, that's exactly right.  That's a niche. That's really sub niche.  And if you go into a big enough city  and you're just getting leads for electric, I mean, I'm sitting here  thinking I shouldn't have said that out loud.  That's a good niche.  Right. The electrical cars are only getting more popular.  I again, I've already had to call.  It's my second time I've had a Tesla and my brother's got one.  I mean, these things are getting in.  It's not just Tesla's now, right?  It's it's all electrical vehicles.  You have to have a special current flowing to the charger to have.  Otherwise, it takes like 24 hours.  It's ridiculous if you just do the regular charger, the 12 volt, whatever.  That's a sub niche inside of electric. I've never done it. OK.  Inside of plumbing, you have what's it called? Sewage.  What am I thinking of, Aaron?  Inside of inside of plumbing, septic, septic removal, I think it is.  Yes, septic tank septic is septic tank removal or septic tank.  Something like that. I know something septic.  I've never done it. I've never done it.  Instead of masonry, you can go into specific things  like block walls, which I'm going to show you today.  Guys, there any niche you're in right now, there's a sub niche.  Inside of inside of concrete, there's two different niches, right?  There's there's flat work, which is what everyone does.  There's decorative, which is what some people do.  And inside of decorative, guess what?  There's another sub niche called cool decking, cool decking.  They go, I did it in my house.  Your your your frickin cement is a million degrees.  Your kids are burning their feet. They come. They lay this nice coat.  They put some flakes on it, kind of looks like an epoxy.  It's called cool decking.  You could just do cool decking leads. And that's two layers deep.  You got concrete, then you got decorative concrete, then you got cool decking.  OK, any niche that you're in that I promise you there's a sub niche.  And that doesn't mean it's always good that, like, for example,  tree service, you could specifically target stump removal.  That's not the move, in my opinion, because stump removal,  there's not that much money in relative to tree service.  But if you were the best at it, and I bet you if you built a stump  removal website, you would outrank the best companies in any city  because nobody's targeting stump removal.  I'd have to run the numbers. I'd have to really figure it out.  And I'm not sure that every company wants stump stump removals.  But that's what I'm saying, guys.  I don't care what it is.  There is an opportunity inside of artificial grass.  There's people that are just searching for artificial grass  for specific things, right?

    "pageContent": " Pet friendly artificial grass.  Right, there's also a sub niche of of artificial grass.  You know, you could target people that are that are doing like  bigger projects. I wouldn't target big commercial projects,  but you could target different types of projects, right?  You just have to get creative.  Even like fencing, huh?  Like even like fencing, I know that that's kind of starting to get  a bit more popular, kind of an untapped niche, super relevant, obviously.  But like when you think about fencing,  there's like dozens of different types of fences.  So you could go wide, horizontal, right, or vertical and one specific niche  within that niche of chain link fence, wooden fence, barbed wire fence, you know?  Yeah, 100 percent.  Another thing I was thinking of is roofing, right?  So obviously, there's roof repair, but there's also metal roofing.  Right. There's specific roofing.  There's I'm sure there's I don't know what it is after the research,  but I know that Tesla or Sun's  Sun City, is that what it's called?  Is that what it's called? Sun City?  Is that Elon Musk's solar company?  I don't know.  Bro, that's going to bug me.  I think it's Sun City.  Yeah, it is. Hold on.  I just have to, you know.  Everyone wants to know as much as I do.  What is it? Why am I having?  Oh, someone said solar city, I think.  Solar City, Sun City.  Thank you, Discord user.  Discord user, thank you.  Point being, guys, there's always a sub niche, and that's the reality.  OK, so I just want you guys to know if, you know,  we've talked about going vertical like we did last week,  but I want you guys to really consider going sub niche.  Every single niche, there's a sub niche.  I don't care what it is.  I wouldn't do this one.  But for example, I know that there's a niche called cell phone repair.  I promise you that there's a way to go sub niche in that.  You could go with iPhone cell phone repair.  And to be honest, I bet you that there's way more people that do that anyway.  But every single niche, there is a sub niche.  And that, I believe, is where the money's at.  The reason why it's good and where there's a lot of money  in taking big niches and then going sub niche  is because typically the big niches are more competitive  and the sub niches are not.  And when you get into the less known niches and then you sub niche,  the only thing you need to be careful of is you need to make sure  there's adequate search volume.  OK, so real quick, guys, I'm going to share my screen.  I'll show you guys one thing really quick.  And then we're going to Q&A. OK, I'm going to try.

You want to send me the link and I'll quickly.  Yeah, you can look it up for me.  So, OK, cool.  What I want to show you guys, well, number one, just go to  go to roofing.  This is I want to show you guys really quick, a quick, easy way  to look at some issues, just kind of like roofing plus a big city.  Do you like roofing?  Chicago, Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Chicago.  Doesn't matter to Chicago.  I'm a Chicago guy. All right.  Go to the top. Organic. All right.  Champion roofing. Beautiful.  I think I've heard of them, but through my research.  And then I want you to just look at the services.  All right. Services.  I hope pop ups for days.  So residential, we got. Oh, man, look at this.  There you go. So you could do roof, you know.  So these guys actually, this is a little bit different  because these guys are going sub niche.  These I technically could argue that these aren't necessarily roofing.  This is some examples, right?  You have roof replacement. That's the big daddy.  You have gutters, which is a sub niche off of roofing.  By the way, I've made a lot of money on gutter installation, gutter cleaning.  There's not a ton of money in.  They're adding masonry in here.  I don't think that's the greatest thing.  Siding is kind of like a whatever.  Let's go to another. Let's go to the next result.  I think these guys are kind of these guys are kind of shiny penny, in my opinion.  But here I ranking number one.  Oh, roof inspections, custom designers.  I didn't think of those that design roof design.  Never thought of that.  Root residential roof repair residents.  They're targeting just residential commercial roof.  I didn't know what that is. Infrared.  I don't know.  And then.  And every single one of these sub niches would shake roof system.  Hilarious metal roof system, slate roof system, clay tile.  Unbelievable. OK, Aaron, I want you to go.  I want to give you guys an example of a quick before we get on this off.  So hold on one second.  You can just keep this window open like this, guys.  One of the very first deals I got when I got back into Legion,  because you guys know that maybe you don't.  But when I got back, I got in this business.  I got a couple of deals. I got shiny penny syndrome.  I, you know, whatever.  And out of necessity, I had to get back into this business.  And I came back and I started doing SEO because I needed quick cash.  And once I realized that SEO wasn't going to scale,  I think it may have been the very first website I ever sold doing regeneration  when I finally realized, oh, my gosh, this is where the money's at.  Was a sub niche of masonry.  So I want you to go and I want you to type in St.  George Block Wall just in the in the let's see how the",

I know that I can tell.  Look at this thing. This is a beauty.  OK, so St. George Block Wall.  I built this thing. You can even go to who is go look at who is, bro.  I think it's going to show you. I bought this in 2019.  I think I should have been.  Go look at it really quick. Look me up.  And while you do that, I'm going to get my stripe account  and tell you how much money I've made from this one.  I don't even.  Is it who is domain?  Yeah. Do you have SEO quick on your toolbar?  I don't. OK, don't worry about it.  But anyway, I was going to just prove to you guys that I.  Oh, and I'm not even logged in on Stripe on this computer.  So my laptop, never mind.  I know for a fact, I've made over twenty thousand dollars.  Go back to the website.  Is it right there?  I'd have to figure it out.  I don't know. It's not that relevant.  So go back to the website.  This website right here, dinky freaking website ever has.  I know for a fact, if not, it's probably closer to 30,  but I can with 100 percent confidence say I know it's made me over.  It's made me for sure over twenty thousand dollars. OK.  And you know what the best part about this is, Aaron,  is that the person that I was selling these leads to for twelve hundred dollars  a month for over a year and a half,  they're still paying me for a different set of leads.  But this person ended up joining their part of digital landlords.  The business owner of this of this is a digital landlord.  They decided they're like, dude, I love doing what I do.  They make like I think they make like seven million dollars a year.  Their company does. They don't even do block wall.  They do stucco and they wanted to start learning how to do this  because they wanted to not have to be stuck to their city.  So it's it's it's hilarious how this works.  Anyway, this thing's made me over twenty thousand dollars.  And we're talking about not just masonry, we're talking about block wall.  There's I would say the majority of cities in America.  You wouldn't even know what I was talking about because it's it's  the ugliest fence in the world, but for its climates like Vegas,  St. George, Utah, Phoenix, Arizona, they make us put these ratchet  looking block walls like we're in a prison.  And it's just the way that people do it.  And so I went sub niche.  This thing was making me over twelve hundred dollars.  I think we ended up doing it.  It's like eight hundred dollars a month now, but this thing's ranking so well.  I don't think we even have to run much ads, if any at all.  These sites, these pictures are garbage.  Some of these pictures actually go down a little bit like those ones right there.  I actually that top right one, Francesc and the bottom right one.  Francesca actually took that photo.  She actually drove to a job site, took that photo.  So that's insane.  So, you know, guys, what's cool about that is within",

I think that was a YouTube video you did like last year that talked about.  You got a deal that got lucky, right.  And then, OK, that's right.  You can go into it if you want.  It's competitive, bro.  Very, very. You can make money, just not.  You can make more money elsewhere.  I don't think it's worth the squeeze. That's just my opinion.  I'm going to I'm going to do rapid fire on these Q&A.  Keep going. Cool.  Jen said, would you please repeat the niches?  You said you got your butt kicked in real quick.  I'll we'll be putting this in that cheat sheet real quick.  But I mean, you talk about like roofing, basement waterproofing.  There's like two others there.  Solar.  Alarm systems, CPA.  Yeah, I mean, dude, just anything that plumbing HVAC,  anything that's just very obvious is competitive.  OK, for sure.  And then, yeah, Jason mentioned flat roofing, roofing tile repair,  just as some niches within roofing, which is 100 percent right on.  And then Jensen, what do you charge for St.  George Blackwall? You says a thousand or twelve hundred.  It was twelve hundred when I started.  I think our current time, I wanted to log into my start.  Oh, actually, I might be able to hold on.  Keep going. And I'm going to look this up.  I'll come back. I'm going to see if I can find it real quick.  OK, yeah. She says.  Or what did you charge in the beginning?  I don't know if this is still an active deal you have, but let's see.  No, I still do. I think it's 800 now, by the way.  I just opened up Stripe and I love it's not much.  But I just as well, I was sleeping even better.  I made one hundred and fifty bucks sleeping last night.  That's kind of cool.  That's for epoxy, by the way.  So keep going.  I just had to just every time I see it, it just makes me happy.  For sure. Jaleel says quick question for later.  How one would you introduce yourself to a prospect when cold calling?  If they don't ask, what's your connection to the lead?  So, Jaleel, if you are you talking about like when you call the lead,  we just called your your phone number or the business owner who you're prospecting.  Because we can give you a quick little answer.  That's a next.  Make some YouTube videos on that.  But it's a",

    "pageContent": "good question.  We can quickly address that.  Shane Noble says, do the business owner.  So, yeah, what you do is and Nick actually has a couple of videos on this,  but you pretty much you almost act like the customer start  because you got to get your foot in the door.  You can't just say, hey, are you interested in concrete leads?  You got to say, hey, do you guys do concrete in XYZ city?  Right. Kind of make it sound like you live there. Right.  And then they're going to be you keep going on like, OK, do you do cover the zip code?  You can even get specific. Right.  And then they'll probably ask like, OK, so is this for you or like, yeah,  we can give you a free estimate next week or whatever the case may be.  And that's when you transition to like, oh, it's not for me.  I just got this guy, Bob, who's looking to have a new driveway installed  and just want to make sure it's something you do before wasted any of your time.  Right. And then they don't know what to think.  Or is this a referral friend or whatever?  Now you kind of got some open time before they just click hang up on you.  And that's when you transition to, hey, man, so I got these leads coming in.  I'm looking for someone to send them to.  I wasn't happy to give you a couple for free.  And then all I ask is just later have a conversation  to see about an ongoing partnership.  Like, in short, that's the cold call. Right.  So good. Obviously, there's variables.  But by the way, real quick, I just looked it up.  I just text Francesca about St. George.  But I know we have a couple of different websites  specifically targeting block wall.  And one of them were making three hundred dollars a week.  One of them were making two hundred and twelve dollars a week  just to kind of put it in context.  So there's money in it.  There's definitely money.  Let's go through a couple more. For sure.  So, yeah, Shane says, do you do service pages when you do sub niches?  Yeah. Look at my St. George block wall.  Yeah. It was like cinder blocks, retaining walls, brick masonry, stone mason.  Like all these are block wall related.  I always do a couple of service pages.  I usually do three to five service pages no matter what. Right.  Just helps with ranking.  Plus you get more leads for a bigger piece of the pie.  So. All right. And then Jose says, I already have a roofing site and GMB.  If I change that to roof repair only, well, I mess everything up.  Yeah. With GMB, especially.  Yeah. And it's not so it keep the domain the same,  but you're going to have to go change your title.  You're going to get your page title, your meta description,  all your bolded stuff, your categories, your service pages.  You're better off just starting fresh.  But if the question is, do you already have leads coming in  or are you just trying to write games?  If you have leads coming in and you figured out a rank by all means,  we're trying to avoid having a bunch of extra work.  But if you've been like me and you're dumb enough that you kept doing it  and you ranked great, there's money in it.  It's just it's not worth the squeeze. Right.  For sure.

    "pageContent": "Jen.  She says, how many leads do you get for the block wall sites?  Interested in how that relates to pricing?  Real quick, I can obviously you'll toss in your two cents.  But we typically like to when this actually what you teach, Nick.  But like when you look at the lead value calculator,  you go to like MyLeadCalculator.com, whatever we want to price stuff  so that at the low the worst case scenario or like on a minimum,  we want to at least double or at least triple their profit.  Right. Like on the low end, be conservative.  And so all you got to do that, it's really not a pay per lead basis.  Obviously, I mean, you can do the calculation. Right.  But with stuff like this, generally speaking,  that concrete artificial grass, bigotry service jobs,  if Nick correct me if I'm wrong, generally 10 to 15 leads  is like kind of what you got to aim for to charge at least  a thousand fifteen hundred a month.  Yeah, as long as the niche, as long as they're making,  you know, roughly, I would say with block wall, maybe slightly more.  But yeah, it all just depends on the size of the niche, the profit margins.  And yeah, the rule of thumb is we want to at least double  on a conservative with a conservative number.  But yeah, I never give guarantees.  And typically my websites, I kind of like even though I don't say it out loud,  I kind of lead them to believe like we're not going to get any more  than 10 to 15 leads tops.  And then I go in and I smash it for him.  I know that site gets like  30 leads a month. It has been for a while.  And I know that because it's been I've had that I've had.  I've had to change clients because my client joined my program  and stopped by my leads, which is ironic.  But I replaced them.  And we've had that site go lives in 2019.  Awesome, dude. One more question.  Yeah. So Shane has to hop off.  Great to have you on, Shane.  Trey says, what do you tell the lead when you don't have the business  to say you work with for?  That's a great question, Trey.  Usually just Nick always says this, like, take control,  tell them what they want to hear.  So when you answer, just you move the process along.  You're the one who is controlling things like, hey, Bob, so I missed a call.  We missed a call. You're looking for a concrete estimate.  Like, yeah. So like, OK, what I'm going to do is I'm going to quickly get your info.  The business owner, he's on the field right now.  But later today, when he's available,  we're going to call you back and that way we can schedule an estimate.  Right. And that's when you'll do the three way.  Just use the term business owner.  You don't need to box yourself in. OK.  Aaron, real quick, before we get to the last question,  I want you to share the digital landlords application link.  And I'm going to tell you why we're going to be doing.  I had this crazy idea and I'm going to be  I haven't decided if I'm going to be taking one or two people.  But basically, long story short is we're going to be doing something  that's kind of outside the box by with inside of digital landlords.  It's going to be by application and qualification only.

Basically, long story short, I'm not going to tell you all the details,  but we're we're almost going to handhold you to getting your first deal.  And it's it's going to be unique.  You are going to have to do something in exchange.  But for those of you that are like a little bit nervous or whatever, this  like I'm basically going to make sure that you guys get a deal.  So for those of you that are on the fence, I just want to  I haven't talked about it much on this call at all.  But Aaron just dropped a link.  If you guys value your time and you're like, hey, these calls are great.  I'm tired. Like some of you guys that are sitting here  just waiting for free information.  Now you've waited six weeks.  You should have had to do if you were in the program,  you could have had a deal by now. Right.  But you're you're getting dribbled content and we're still talking about niches.  Right. Because I can't cover everything in these calls.  So anyway, here's the heads up.  If that's something you've been on the fence about, I would apply right now  because I have something really interesting.  And it's we're going to be doing that either this week or next week.  So mention this, what I just mentioned.  And I will anyway, it's it's it's it's very interesting.  Any if everyone is called would find it interesting.  So just a heads up. OK, one more question.  Yeah, let's see.  Trey says this is the last question.  Have you heard of anyone having luck in saltwater aquarium niche?  No, but why not?  You could do like fish tank installation, maybe like for artsy, fartsy, rich.  For sure, bro. Like when I was in pool installation, guys,  I had a website in Vegas, fiberglass drop in pools.  So it's not landscaping, it's pools, it's not just pools, it's  it's it's prefab pools, it's not just prefab pools,  it's fiberglass prefab pools in Vegas.  And the guys pay me two thousand bucks a month.  Say less, Nick, say less.  Guys, thanks for being on the call.  Did you get a screenshot of everyone's on this call right now?  Doing it right now. Thanks for the reminder.  If you're on this call, you get the camera on,  you're going to get a nice little nicely packaged digital resource  that Aaron's going to put together today from my notes.  And you're going to get that DM to you.  And with that said, guys, again, if you're somebody, it's like, hey,  I'm tired of like once you guys it clicks for you guys,  that time is not coming back.  You're not getting it back.  Then you'll start to realize that who gives a rat's turd about money?  You can always make the money back, dude.  That money I spent to launch my program, dude, you know, it's funny about that.  Well, people don't realize  that guy that I that trained me on how to launch a program.  I bought that in 2021.

You want to get close to somebody, go buy their stuff.  I wasn't doing it for that intention, but this guy had me on his show.  I've got his personal cell phone number.

    "pageContent": " I love talking business. I love helping people make money because it helps me make money.  Okay. I'm not the philanthropist. I'm not the guy that's going to say I like to help people.  I like to help people make money because that's how I make money. So let's just clear that out of  the way. But what I want to share with you really quickly to give you a little bit of confidence  that you did make the right decision and I do want to thank you and tell you right now  that I will make sure that you get far more value than you will ever spend with me. That is my  commitment to you because I know how this works. I know that I need to help you get deals. You're  here for one reason and that is to make money. You are here to get deals and if I can help you  get deals, I'm therefore going to make money. Okay. But I want to give you a little bit of  confidence and say this does work and I'm not talking about the case studies, which is social  proof. I want to just tell you how this came to be really quickly. This is not something that a  couple of months ago I sat down and went, you know what? There's a huge opportunity to make money  and I'm going to develop this system and I'm going to sell it. No, what happened was in 2019,  as you guys may or may not know, I was $60,000 in debt. I had two cars. I lived in a different  house. I had a house payment. I had three kids and I had a really upset wife who didn't even  know about that debt. I sat down and I looked at my situation and I looked at my goals and I was  like, I want to make $100,000 a month. I can't do this. I can't work for somebody else. I have to  own the thing. I have to own the business. I had been doing some version of a digital agency for  years and years and years and I couldn't scale. What this is, what you're about to watch, what  Flat Fee Mastery is, is it is the product of how I was able to go from a situation that was very  dire to doing seven figures in a 12-month period. That is what this is. This is something that came,  this was the solution to my problems. This is the solution to how do I scale up and hit the  $100,000 per month goal that I had set for myself and that is how this came. I want to make sure  that you understand this did not come as a way to make money. This came because I needed to get  out of that really terrible situation and I figured out this thing called results in advance  and this thing called running ads to a landing page and all these different little pieces of  the puzzle and I started testing and I started tweaking and I started refining and I developed  this process. I just want you to know that the reason that I can assure you that this works is  yeah forget about the case studies, forget about all the people that I've already shown  you that have tried this and made this work but this is exactly what I used to get out of my  situation that was the catalyst to get me to where I am today. I believe the best products are those  that were made as solutions. There were those that were made to solve problems, not the ones  that were created, not products that were created just to make money and I'll tell you  that this what you're about to jump into, what you're about to see, what you're about to go  through was the solution that I came up with to my problems.",

    "pageContent": " Now that we've picked the right niche and the right city, we want to figure out are  there actually people in that niche and city that are going to be willing to buy our product,  to buy our leads, right?  Because you can pick the right niche and the right city.  You could do everything correct.  You could start getting leads, but if there's no one in that city that wants to buy what  you're selling, it's not worth anything.  So what we're going to talk about is we're going to talk about who we should actually  target.  And what I mean by that is who are the people, who are the business owners that we're going  to go after when we're trying to sell these leads?  A lot of people say, I hate sales, Nick, you know, sales isn't my forte, I'm just not comfortable  doing sales.  I like the technical side and it's just, it's just not me, right?  But I'm going to, I'm going to argue and tell you this.  If you say you hate sales or you haven't had a good experience with sales or the people  that say that, they are talking to the wrong people.  Because when you are selling something that somebody wants, if you're talking to somebody  about something they want, it is a very, very, very enjoyable conversation.  So if you're somebody that's like, oh, I hate sales, or it's just not for me, or you never  had a good experience doing sales, it's because you were trying to sell something to the wrong  person, okay?  And I experienced this, I did door to door sales.  I'd go door to door to door.  And I had no idea if people on the other side of the door wanted home security systems,  I had no idea if they wanted cameras, I had no idea if they wanted door locks, I didn't  know.  With this, what we're going to do is we are only going to target people who are already  sold, people who are already paying for advertising, which is basically like them saying, they're  raising their hand saying, hey, call me, I am interested, I am paying right now with  my own dollars for leads.  And so those are the people that we're going to target.  Okay, guys, the game here is we are going to target people that are already sold.  And the telltale sign that somebody's already sold is they're already paying for advertising,  whether it's Google Ads, HomeAdvisor, Angie's List, you name it, that is a telltale sign  that they are already sold.  So what we're going to do is we're going to come up, we're going to build a list.  Before we ever build a website, before we ever spend a dollar, we are actually going  to build a list of people that are already spending money on these services.  And the reason we're going to do that is two part.  Number one is so that we know that there's a buyer in that market or multiple buyers,  number one.  But number two is when leads start coming in, we don't want to be scrambling.  We don't want leads to be going cold.  We want to have a list already in place where we can just take the lead, hit the list, and  we can get somebody on the hook, okay?  So I want to share my favorite, people that are paying for advertising.  There's different, you know, places that we're going to look and I'm going to share my favorites  in order.  Number one is my number one favorite person to target is somebody paying for Google Ads.  Number two is somebody that's paying for Home",

And then after that, it's, you know, Thumbtack, Yelp, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.  And the reason I like Google Ads so much is because of this.  Well, first of all, number one is if somebody's paying for Google Ads and you see they're  paying for Google Ads at that very moment and you see, hey, they're paying for ads,  that means they're paying for ads right then.  And so they currently at that moment are spending money.  Whereas with Home Advisor, they could be on Home Advisor or they could be on Angie's  list listed as a business, but they have shut it off, paused it, et cetera.  So number one is I know they're paying for ads right now.  And number two is with Google Ads, what they're getting is clicks.  They're literally paying for somebody to click on their link.  They're not getting calls.  They're not paying for any of this stuff.  They're getting clicks.  And so what's cool is I can come in and say, hey, you're paying for clicks and I can get  you jobs, right?  You're paying for clicks because you want jobs.  I can get you the jobs.  Last reason why I like Google Ads so much is typically the budgets are a lot higher.  With Home Advisor, you'll see a lot of people paying 300 bucks, 200 bucks, 500 bucks.  With Google Ads, it's very, very common for people to be spending 1,000, 1,500, 2,000.  And so they're already used to paying a decent chunk of change.  So what we're going to do in this entire module is we are going to build a list of business  owners that are already sold on what we're selling.",

Eventually you wanna do it.  And I've heard people say like,  obviously you wanna go set up an LLC  because you wanna tell yourself  and you wanna tell the world,  you wanna act like you're doing this for real.  This isn't just some dabbling.  And I'm not saying that you shouldn't do it  for those reasons.  What I'm saying is that don't let,  oh, I don't wanna do any cold calls today  because I don't have an LLC.  Don't let that be the thing that stops you.  Go get some deals, man.  I did, let's see, I did the towing deal.  I did the basic waterproofing deal.  I did three or four deals back in 2016  when I first started this  before I even thought about an LLC.  I wasn't even sure this model still would work.  This is back to six years ago, okay?  So if you have somebody that could set it up for you  and whatever, just go, yeah, have them do it.  That's great.  Don't let that be the thing  that prioritizes making cold calls.  Don't let that be the thing  that prioritizes doing due diligence  or doing Zoom closes or whatever.  Make sure to prioritize the things that actually matter  versus the thing that is urgent, okay?  Sometimes those are the same thing,  but a lot of times the things that actually matter  are not urgent.  And so they get pushed to the back burner  and the front burner gets the stuff that's urgent,  but doesn't move the needle, okay?  Always be moving the needle.",

There's not going to be specific things they're necessarily going to say. Sometimes  there will be, sometimes they'll say something, but most of the time it's what they're not saying  or they're just being too agreeable. Like I remember somebody posted a video in here of them  doing a hook, right? And the person just kept saying, yeah, that sounds good. Yeah. Okay. Cool.  Sounds good. And it was like, they just kept saying yes, because it was easier than saying no.  So it's more Nick, when you're listening to this, go watch module one, rewatch it.  I'm sorry, not module one, module four, go watch, go rewatch module four and, and do that. But the  other thing is I'll guarantee that this could solve 99% of your problems. Nick is just start making it  a habit. When you get to the end of that call and they sound interested and they keep going along  with you, do this, do the pullback. Hey, look, man, just want to double check, like happy to send  you a lead or two for free, but if that's all you're looking for, I'll still send it to you,  but I just want to be candid with you. I am looking to partner with somebody. So I just  want to make sure we're going to be good to talk in a couple of days. Is that cool? And if they,  if at that point you're giving them an out and if they're like, well, actually I'm actually pretty  busy, like, like double commit them, pull back. Like I don't care if you don't want to talk,  just tell me I'm a big boy. I'm a big girl. I don't need you to just, you know, kiss my  ass. Tell me the truth. So that, I think Nick, the real question here, I know what you're dealing  with. Start doing the pullback every single time and you're going to start, you're going to start  getting the not serious people out. And maybe these people, some of these are serious, but just  because of the, you're acting timid to ask that question. Um, they're, they're just going along  with you and then they're, they're kind of pushing them away. So try that. I think that  will solve a lot of your problems.",

Just be careful that with chat GPT that you see what Google, Google's most updated terms of service are on AI generated content because I know, based on talking to a really close friend of mine that is in this industry thickly thickly  is not a word but very thick he's been doing this since the internet was around.  And a couple of you guys were actually in that meeting with me when he had this.  But he said that either the day before the day after Google very coincidentally and very quietly updated their terms of service, and said that anything that resembles AI generated content is not allowed blah blah blah blah blah.  Now, that was a couple months ago. Six weeks ago, has that changed. I don't know, because I'm not using chat GPT yet.  Although I'm very excited about the possibilities. Do I think chat GPT is going to ruin this business model. No, I do not. Do I think that it's going to change it, of course it is right, of course it is, but I'm excited about the change I'm excited  because man do I hate content, and it's kind of going to level the playing field.  If it's allowed, and if we can figure out ways it's allowed but guys, the only thing I would tell you is, I don't recommend doing things, you know, manually just for the sake of doing it manually, but sometimes doing the thing that other people are not willing to do  is the very reason or way that you outdo everybody. Okay. And so, I have one, I have made so much money by spending time and getting good at writing content so that I could then go and hire people to write content, so that I could check it.  So then I could then hire a project manager who could then hire a VA that could write content so that I didn't have to touch it.  But I initially learned how to write content guys for my first 30, this is not recommended but for my first 30 Legion properties. Every bloody word on those websites, I wrote, I wrote on my keyboard on my MacBook Air, the thin MacBook Air in 2016.  It was like the base model of the base model slower than tar. You have a few pictures on there that things slow as heck 13 inch screen, I wrote 30,000 30 websites, and I had between five and 10,000 words of content on every one of those websites, do the math.  Okay, that's how I learned how to do content so well. And I hate it. I hate every second of it's not fun for me. Okay, but again, you know why I do it because I don't have to. It's something I can do.  I can put on my website, and if it's good and it ranks, I'm going to get paid again and again and again for content that I wrote five years ago.",

    "pageContent": " So guys, you start building your list and you're like, well, there's not that many people  paying for Google ads.  There's a couple on Home Advisor, but should, like, what do I do and should I continue to  pursue this if there's not that many people paying for Google ads?  That is a really good question and I'm going to talk about that right now.  So I want you to have, like, think about it this way.  The first thing that you want to think about is, okay, you're in Utah, you're in Pennsylvania,  you're in California, wherever you're sitting, and you're probably searching for, you know,  these searches in a different state.  Maybe not, but most likely you are.  And so one of the reasons why you might not be seeing ads is because of where you're searching  from.  Now, that's not always the case, but that is sometimes the case.  So I'm going to recommend a couple of tools that you can use where you can put in the  search terms and you can put in the city and it's actually going to search it as if  you were there.  Okay, it's going to kind of, like, change your IP address, if you will, and it's going  to give you different search results, different ads are going to show up because it's going  to look like you're actually there.  So a couple of those tools, if you look at my screen here, a couple of those tools that  I'm going to recommend, I actually have never used this one, I kind of like it.  I'm not sure, it looks like there's a paid, like, you could do a free trial.  I got a couple of searches for free.  It was seranking.com, actually really cool.  Like that one a lot.  You could check that out.  You literally put in the keyword, you know, country's already there unless you are in  Australia, Canada, I don't care where you're at, you put in the country and then you put  in the location.  So that was cool.  I checked this box.  Another popular fan fave is the valentine.app.  That's one that's kind of an OG, if you want to check that one.  So a couple of tools that you can check out to change what it looks like your location  is to give you a different search result.  The next thing that I do is this.  That's number one.  Next thing that I do, if you keep following along with me here on the screen, is if you  type in the city that you're targeting, so let's say Queen Creek Concrete, and we go  to the map, I like to just look at this and go, okay, you know, obviously we're trying  to target these cities that no one else is necessarily, they're not on people's radar.  So Queen Creek, I don't know, it's right here.  So what are the cities and suburbs around that specific city we're targeting that are  bigger, maybe people, they're more on people's radar that people would be willing to drive  to?  So I'm going to start from here, I'm going to start typing in Concrete Chandler, Concrete  Gilbert, Concrete Mesa, Concrete Tempe, Concrete Scottsdale, even Concrete Phoenix, because  that is not that far.  A lot of these people, they advertise in Phoenix, but they're actually based down here.  The majority of the people I know and have talked to in the businesses I work with, they  don't live in Glendale and Phoenix proper.  They live down in the southeast corner with Chandler, Gilbert, Mesa, Tempe, Queen Creek, ",

    "pageContent": "they live down there anyway.  So what I would then start doing is after you look at the valentine.app, some of these  other tools, I would then just go use your same keywords and look at nearby cities,  because if there's a business that's in Chandler, that's not a very far drive, and that's almost  like a neighborhood, that's like a little suburb, if you will.  So those are the first two things that I would do.  Here's what you need to do.  Ultimately, though, this is what it comes down to, is you need to make a decision.  Let's say you do this, let's say you just still can't find anyone on Google Ads, or  there's maybe one person, or there's one person, but you're like, I don't know, maybe they're  a lead gen company, whatever, but there are people on Home Advisor, but there's just not  a lot of people paying for Google Ads.  You need to make a decision.  I will tell you this, it is possible to sell to somebody who is not paying for Google Ads  or advertising.  Yes, I have done it, there are many, many people that have done that.  And before I discovered how much easier this was, that's all that I did.  So yes, it is possible.  And so here's the decision you need to make, is you need to make the decision, especially  if it's your first deal, is this worth the squeeze?  Because you can turn any website that is producing leads into money if you try hard enough.  But I'm looking at opportunity cost.  So what I look at is, okay, given the situation, given this specific niche and city location,  is this worth going after at this time?  And here's kind of the rule of thumb that I would give you.  If this, for me personally, if I find a city like Queen Creek, and you guys watched me  do the due diligence, and it was absolutely ridiculously low-hanging fruit, there was  no competition, there was Steve, Steve Wood, or Steve whatever, that didn't even have a  website and he was showing up for everything, I mean, there was nothing, no competition,  and there's search volume, and there's CPC.  For me, where I'm at in my business, I'm going for it, I'm just full-setting, baby, I'm going.  If this is your very first deal, however, my advice to you is if this is your first  deal, and you do all this, and you cannot find people that are paying for Google Ads  after you've done the valentine.app and these different tools, you've looked at nearby cities,  and you're just not seeing that many options, my advice to you is skip it, earmark it, dog,  whatever that term is, put it on the back burner, save it for later, and go find another  one because the game is you gotta get your first deal, that's what we gotta do, no matter  what that looks like, no matter what opportunities you have to avoid, what opportunities you  have to pass up, we want you to get your first deal, because that first deal is gonna get  you the confidence, that first deal is gonna get that mental barrier removed, that first  deal is gonna lead to the second deal, the third deal, the fourth, the fifth, so my advice  to you is if this is your first deal, and you start looking around, and there's just  no one paying for ads that you can find, and you've done a lot of searching, you've tried  all the different apps and tools and nearby cities, skip it, put it on the back burner,  and",

    "pageContent": " Guys, I don't think we should have to say this, but if you're using freaking gift cards or some  other shit, just, I'm not even going to go into that, but like you should be smart enough to know  that's not a good idea. I mean, think about it like this. If one of your clients said, Hey,  can I put this, uh, this gift card on your Stripe account? You'd say, hell no. Because then what  happens next month when it declines, I got to chase you down. You think Google's any different  except for they're, uh, uh, worth 500 billion times more than you and I combined. Like,  of course not. So just be smart as far as like, put yourself in their shoes. You do the same  damn thing as them. I would, I'd suspend everyone's ass and say, well, it's what I'm doing, right?  Like everyone, like, I don't just give you the application to this program. I'm like, go find  fucking thing. And, and, and if you really want to get in, you'll bug me about it. Right? Like I want  people that are serious. And that's what happens when you, you have something like it's like Google  guys back to the law of control, right? The person that cares the least or appears to care  least has all the control. Google has what we need. They have this platform called Google ads.  They do not need our money. They can get money from any, any, everybody else. So therefore they  have all the control and we have to abide by their freaking stupid ass rules. I don't like it any  more than you do, but again, I would do the same thing. So what I'm getting more than even just a  tactical is just like looking at this going, like just instead of treating it like, oh my gosh,  I'm such a victim. Look at it as like, Hey, everyone's going to deal with this. But instead  of me just like being so pissed off, I'm going to master this suspension thing. Because if this has  happened to me, it's probably a problem with multiple people and there's an opportunity there  to help. And so it's like, that's exactly what Jeff did. And now it's like, okay, this is,  this is interesting because he has the skillset and this knowledge that he has acquired by going  through the thing. So just change your mindset of like, it sucks. I get it. But guess what?  It is, it is what it is. It is what it is. It's part of the business. It's a very small and  significant thing. And some of you guys that are freaking out about it, it's like, I just question  how the hell you were raised because like that, if this is throwing you off that bad,  I don't know how you guys coped with stress. Like I've really,  it's, it's wild anyway, but we're talking about a very small subset of people.  I think that's true too. Like just like you said, it's going to happen. It's going to happen to you  again. It's going to happen to me again. At the same time, like, you know, this isn't everybody's  having these issues. So as far as the training goes, like, you know, follow the training,  do what's there. And it could be like your fifth website that gets a flag on it. Like it's not,  it's not necessarily like, if you don't do this, don't like take the action. It's okay.",

I'm gonna share what the one-pager is,  why we use it, and then when we should use it.  Okay, I'm gonna go really quick.  We're gonna get this done,  because guys, let's go make some money.  Number one, what it is.  Very, very simple.  Think about a website and think about the home page, okay?  So, we're not gonna build that entire website.  We're not gonna have service pages, location pages,  about us, all that crap.  We're not going to do that.  We are gonna build a one-page landing page  that we're gonna send traffic to,  and that traffic is gonna convert into leads,  and we're gonna do the least amount of work possible,  the minimal viable product.  We're gonna just have enough  where people are gonna hit the website  and they're gonna call the phone, fill out the form,  we're gonna generate leads, okay?  It's very simple, don't overthink it.  Just think about a regular website, a home page, okay?  There are certain things that we do need to include  on this home page, and I'm gonna go over those,  but everything outside of that,  you don't need to worry about that.  I will tell you, it is worth your time  taking your time building your template  for this first go-around.  Then after that, you can literally copy and paste it  and switch out the content, switch out the words,  switch out the, or just the same thing,  switch out the background image,  switch out the phone number,  and it becomes very quick and easy, okay?  So, that's what a one-pager is,  and some of you guys are watching this video  and you are going to go pre-sell a site, okay?  Great, welcome.  Some of you guys went and you sold a site  that you already had,  and now you're getting ready to pre-sell a site, okay?  There's gonna be multiple different reasons why you're here,  but this is what you're going to do, okay?  So, why do we do it?  Well, number one is speed.  We want to do this as quickly as possible.  We wanna do this as quickly as possible,  as cheaply as possible,  because, as I've said many, many, many times,  money loves speed, okay?  So, we wanna do that as quickly as possible,  and that is why we're going to be building the one-pager.  So, speed, speed, speed.  Secondly, we are gonna be building this  on what's called a sub-domain.  So, we're gonna be doing a .wix, a .weebly,  whatever, you could use WordPress.  We're gonna be doing this on a sub-domain,  and what that means is we don't have to pay for the domain.  So, instead of having to go buy the, you know,  cedarcityconcrete.com or minneapolisconcrete.com,  this is gonna be minneapolisconcrete.weebly.com,  and we're not gonna have to pay for it.  So, speed, cost.  The other thing that's really awesome about this  is it allows us to test the market  without having ongoing recurring costs.  So, it has kind of a combination  between the other two things that I said.  We're gonna be able to build this one-pager  for very little time, very little money,  and quickly go",

So, those are just a couple of reasons  why this is such a valuable tool.  The thing I love the most, above all, is the speed.  The fact that I could literally look at a project  and say, hey, I need a one-pager in Minneapolis  for concrete, and I could have that one one-hour's time,  and I would have no money spent into it.  That is a amazing thing, okay?  So, that's what it is, why we do it,  and then thirdly is, when should you do the one-pager?  Okay, when should you do,  when should you utilize these one-pagers?  And it's up to you, this is your business.  You're free to go build out full sites, okay?  You're free to do your homework on the niche in the city,  and just go build the full Monty.  That's you, if you hate money, go do that, okay?  However, I'm gonna tell you that the answer to this  is I use the one-pager every single time,  every single time.  Let me give you one example.  So, we have a client right now, he's a masonry guy.  We call him the other day, we're like, hey, are you happy?  Just kinda checking in, he's like, yeah,  everything's going great.  He's like, I actually have a friend, he does excavation,  he wants to use you guys,  he wants to get some leads from you guys.  So, keep the deals done, right?  We're crushing it for this one guy,  he referred us to his buddy, deal's done.  We're like, okay, cool, what should we do?  And in the past, I used to just like,  because I got the deal, I'm like, oh, I'll just go  and build out the website because we're using his money.  The deal's already done, right?  That's not what we do anymore.  Now what we do is, I'm actually going to sign the deal,  I'm gonna get his money,  but before I go build out the full website,  I'm actually, for the first at least three months,  I'm gonna be running ads to a one-pager.  Now, why would I do that if I already got the deal?  Well, I'm not familiar with excavation.  I don't know if that niche is going to really work  in the city we're targeting.  I just don't, part of my gut tells me  that it's too commercial heavy  and that most people are gonna know who to call.  I don't know if it's gonna work.  So instead of building out a full site,  even though it's his money, I'd rather keep the money,  use an MVP, what I mean by MVP is a minimal viable product,  which is like a one-pager, okay?  Use a one-pager that costs me no money, no time.  I run it for three months, and if it's crushing it,  okay, cool, in three months, we take some of the profits,  we build out the full website, and we like,  hey, this niche in this city works really well, okay?  However, if we do this, and a couple months in,  we find",

    "pageContent": "out, hey, the calls we're getting,  they're not really the leads this guy's looking for.  They're kind of just random stuff,  people looking for jobs, whatever it is.  Now I can go to him and say, hey, here's the deal.  We have a six-month agreement,  but this isn't really working.  The niche city doesn't, you know, whatever.  I didn't build out a full website.  I don't have this hosting bill and this tracking number  and all this stuff I gotta take care of.  I didn't have to pay for the content.  I didn't have to pay employees to build this out, right?  And I still made a profit.  So I use the one-pager every single deal.  Even if it's a layup, hey, here's a referral,  I use it because I wanna test it  and make sure that I pick the right city.  Maybe I'm looking at the Dallas-Fort Worth area  and I have a guy that covers all the area,  and he's like, hey, I would love to get leads in Arlington.  Okay, cool, so what I'm gonna do  is for the first couple months,  even though I got the deal, it's a referral,  I'm gonna go do a one-pager probably in Arlington,  Plano, whatever cities that he's interested in,  and I'm probably gonna run a test  with these three different landing pages  to see which one's getting me the cheapest, best leads.  Okay, so just a few examples.  One last thing that I really like to use this one-pager for  is if I have a client in a big city, let's say Atlanta,  and we got the deal, I did the one-pager,  we went through the process, I got the deal.  But two months later, something happens  that's not ranking that quick,  and the business owner's like,  Nick, I need more leads, or whatever,  and they're kinda getting frustrated,  I can tell they're getting frustrated.  What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go and research  some of the suburbs around Atlanta,  so Norcross, Marietta, maybe Flowery Branch,  and I'm gonna do the homework on those.  And then I'm gonna be able to go build one-pagers  in Marietta, in Norcross, maybe in Flowery Branch,  and run ads to those landing pages  and supplement that deal, he doesn't even need to know,  say hey, I'm just gonna keep pushing him leads,  he doesn't know that it's coming  from a separate landing page,  they're all just gonna funnel to him,  and it's a way that you can kind of increase the leads  if things get a bit stagnant,  and it's a beautiful way to use that one-pager.  So there's a ton of application,  there's a ton of use for these one-pagers,  my biggest piece of advice is learn how to do this,  build a kick-ass template, learn how to do it,  master it, and then we can go to the next step,  which is outsource it, but you are going to be using this  on every single deal,  because we are going to use other people's money  to build our empire.

    "pageContent": " Another question that comes to us is regarding the the CPC limits. Some people want to know  how do you know or what is too high for CPC. So when we go through our Google Keyword Planner  it gives us a range of the low page and the top of page bid. Sometimes those are within a few dollars  of each other. Sometimes there's wide variance. Sometimes you have a low page bid at like six  dollars and the top of page bid could be closer to thirty dollars. When you have those big ranges  it makes it a little more difficult to figure out. But what I typically see when I get that  question is that, and this is an example I have on the screen right now, is that you're choosing  a large city which you're not supposed to do and you're choosing a very competitive niche which  you're not supposed to do. So when we see a large city in a competitive niche you're going to see  that larger more expensive CPC. What is too much? You know according to the training we try to keep  it between like five like around the five dollar range on Simrush. As you go into the ad you'll  see sometimes it's a little bit more. But here I have something brought up. This is an ad that we  were running for Nick for a little while and it was for duck cleaning. I believe that the website  was starting to get some its own organic leads but we were having CPC of up to forty dollars per  click on some of these. And you can see here that we're able to be really good and we're able to  play and keep our average CPC in the ten dollar range and sometimes the fourteen dollar range.  But knowing that niche, and this is for the New Orleans area, so big city, expensive niche, knowing  that it is we know that we're going to spend more. We know it's going to cost a lot to get those leads  and so for us running that ad we weren't afraid of having those thirty dollar clicks because we  know what we were going to get on the other side. We know what niche we were playing in. So for you  guys if you're seeing something that seems way high up there I'd ask you to go back look at the  population of the city. Look at the population that you're running your ads over and think about  what niche you're running because that's typically where I see where that becomes an issue.",

If at any point it's not checking the boxes,  get out and go to the next city, okay?  And Melissa, really quick, one thing I wanna just mention  is if you are having a hard time finding cities  with adequate search volume and whatever,  adequate search volume, but low-ish population,  then my advice, go and just do a new niche.  And it doesn't mean you're not gonna come back to concrete,  but sometimes you get so in one niche,  you get so exhausted and burned out  that it just defeats the purpose.  So my advice to you, if you're looking at a bunch of cities,  go do fencing, go try tree service, okay?  Go do that and just try that and see what you find  and it's gonna be refreshing  because you're gonna be into a new niche, okay?",

Yeah, Jason, you can do, you guys can sell, you know, you guys can still do deals. I talked about this last week, winter's coming.  You guys have a couple of really, really good weeks. There's going to be a slow period from like December 15th to the end of the year, because it's, it's not only cold, but it's the holidays and everyone gets weird.  But then on January 1st, everyone's magically motivated. But up until about mid December, it's a phenomenal time to get deals because everyone's, you know, things are starting to things are starting to cool off.  And I don't just mean with the with the weather. I mean, with business, dude, it's like, it's that time of year where things start to cool down and people like, shoot, I got Christmas coming up, I got to make some money.  Little Johnny wants that freaking little, that little bike, a little e-bike, that little motorcycle at 50 cc that's actually electric, they can buzz the school. So you can be like all the other kids and we keep with the Joneses. That's what people are going into right now, dude.  Okay.

Okay, don't oversell it, let them know, hey, you know, this is this is, we can get this thing going for you.  And as you know, it's going to be the slowest time of year. So the good thing is, you know, going forward, it's not going to get any lower. It's going to be better from here. But you know how December is, right, dude. I mean, it's just it's winter, right? You just have you just don't oversell it. You got to you got to frame it correctly. You got to make sure that the business owner is aware that it may be a little slow. But to them, it might not be slow because they have nothing to compare it to. Right. They never worked with you before. But yeah, absolutely, guys. I am never, you know, there's some people that are out there that are like,  you know, I don't do you know, during these months, I've met business owners, you guys will meet business owners like this, right? Like, let's say they're in concrete. I knew this guy was in I think it was concrete. And he told me he's like, look, I'll buy your leads until December or whatever. And he's like, then what I do is I literally leave my state, whatever he was at. And I moved to Florida for December and January and February. It's like, I don't kick pick back up until March. Okay. And guys, I  think there's something to be said there if you need it. And that's the best time to take it off. But for those of us that don't give a shit about taking time off, and we're out to go and take over the world, and we want to go as big as possible, we want to go and shake things up, and we want to see how big we can take this, then I'm a big believer that you're always do deals. Okay, I'm a big believer that you're always buying real estate, I'm a big believer that you're always, you know, you're just moving forward, you're not an idiot. But you're always  doing deals, and you're not going to try and time it",

When I launched this program, I launched it on at the worst time of year, on probably one of the worst days I could have launched it, everyone I talked to said, you know, don't launch it on a holiday, because people are going to be out with their families not going to be sitting by a computer, no one's going to show up to your pitch. And don't do it like during the winter, because dude, that's going to be the slowest time of year. Guess what I did, I launched this bitch, I literally announced it the night before, thanks  giving 2021. And I launched it on Black Monday, right? Couldn't have been and they also say don't do it on Mondays. And I debated I said, man, maybe I should wait till February, March. You know, then this is my justification for not taking action like well as we spring, it'd be easier to get deals.  And I was like, no, no, hell no. We're going to run this on, you know, whatever next week, whenever I decided this, I'm like, and I'm going to do it because it's now's the time. Okay. So I'm always doing deals, I don't try and time it perfectly, try and time it perfectly, you're going to lose, okay, you try and time the deal perfectly, because you know, the business owner didn't sound like whatever, you're going to lose deals, okay. Now, is there a situation where you get on the phone, the business owners partners not on? Yes, maybe you reschedule there. But I know people who they get into  a deal, and everything is good to go. Maybe, you know, whatever happened, the business owner doesn't have this or doesn't have that or they whatever they're at a job site, and they told them not to be sometimes you just got to send it, dude, most of the time, you just got to send it. And I believe it evens out, I would rather go for it and have that mentality of like full send every single time. You're going to win in the long run. Okay, so Jason, yes, set expectations, don't be afraid to do deals, it's a great time to do deals, have the mentality that deals happen in the winter, and it's a great time you're going to get deals.

    "pageContent": " I want you guys to remember that, sell, dinner, not marriage.  I want to talk about the objective of this step of calling the business owner directly  and getting them on the hook.  Why do we do this?  Okay, so I want to share a story really briefly.  Back when I was doing door-to-door sales, I saw this thing happen over and over and  over and I saw this happen as I transitioned into selling software and I had salespeople  and I saw it happen in my own life and I've seen it happen with people in this program  already.  Okay, so I want to tell you about this thing.  All right, so guys, going back to when I sold door-to-door, this actually happened with  me first and what happened is I jumped into this door-to-door thing, I got taught a very  basic pitch.  Okay, they said, here's the stats, go knock on the door, here's what you're selling,  I didn't know much about the product, I didn't know much about sales, I didn't know much  in general.  And I started knocking doors and I started saying this basic pitch and what happened  was crazy.  I started selling deals.  I literally started selling deals, I started just doing what they told me and I started  selling deals.  And what happened is after I hit deal number 17, I hit a slump, okay?  I hit a slump where I, what they call bagel, where I didn't sell for two, almost three  days in a row.  And I know some people, it's like, oh, that's not that much.  To me, that was everything because I was so determined I was going to hit this goal.  I had sold 17 deals, I thought I was going to be, I thought I was it, right?  So to not sell for two days in a row after having just moved my family all the way out  to a different state, my pregnant wife, it was scary.  And then day three, I barely snuck in a deal at the end of the day.  And so that happened to me and I've seen this happen to countless reps.  I saw this happen to my center as well, so I'm going to tell you what it is.  What happens to everyone is they get in to a program, to a sales organization, to whatever,  and they take the basic script, if the training is decent, if they're selling a good product,  and they take the basics of the training, okay?  They don't know much about the product, they don't know much about the training, they just  take the basic overview and they start putting in reps.  And the craziest thing happens, they start to get deals, okay?  Happens every time.  I started to get deals doing door-to-door sales.  Some of you guys that are watching this because you're on version 2.0 and you've already seen  version 1.0, you got your first deal doing exactly what I trained and then all of a sudden,  oh my gosh, I'm in a slump, okay?  Here's what happens.  You get in and you're just being simple and to the point and it makes sense.  And then what happens is you start to learn, you start to learn more about the product,  which is our leads, you start to learn more about the sales process, you start to hear  one-liners from me and from other people, and guess what?  You start to over-complicate the process.  And so for me, what ended up happening back when I was doing door-to-door sales is now  I started to know more about the product, I started to know more about the",

And I started to use these extra lines in my pitch because I heard managers using them.  So I just started inserting them when they didn't need to be inserted, okay?  And I saw this exact same thing happen to my setter because this is the part where we're  setting the hook.  I saw this happen to my setter literally a year ago.  She came in, I did 44 minutes of training, I had a lick of sales experience, didn't know  anything about our product, I did 44 minutes of training, I gave her a script and she went  out and set, it was between 10 and 12, she hooked 10 to 12 people, literally week one.  And I was like, holy crap, this chick can ball, okay?  And guess what?  A week, maybe 10 days later, maybe it was two weeks, can't remember, she starts to go  into a slump.  She goes from setting 10 to 12 appointments to setting like two.  And she's like, Nick, I don't know what's going on, I was doing well and I've lost my  edge and oh my gosh, it started to affect her confidence.  And then I started saying, okay, start recording yourself, guys, you should be recording everything  you do, okay?  And I said, start recording yourself.  So she started recording herself and I started going in and watching.  Guess what?  She, not her fault, because I didn't tell her this, but she started trying to sell the  deal on the hook, okay?  She started to, during the process when she would call the business owner, this part right  here, she would start getting into too much information.  She started dropping price, she started telling them about the deal structure, she started  them way too much information and as a result, it confused the customer and as a result,  we stopped hooking people.  Telling you right now that this part of the process, the goal is to sell dinner, not marriage,  okay?  We're not trying to get the business owner to buy on this call.  We're not, okay?  These business owners are going to have to go through a series of steps in order for  us to get this deal.  And so, do not try and sell the deal on this call.  All you're trying to do is get them to the next step.  And the next step is to get them to accept a couple of leads in exchange for a conversation.  That is it.  You are not ever going to sell the deal, you're not going to call somebody out of the blue  and then I say you're never, I'm talking 99.9% of the time, okay?  Now I know, someone's going to go, oh I did it this one time.  I'm telling you, if you do that every time, you're going to lose way more deals than you're  going to gain.  The goal is to get them to the next step and the next step is getting them leads.  You are selling dinner, which is the next step, not marriage.  We're not going in the gate, meeting somebody, meeting a guy, meeting a girl, first thing,  boom, let's get married, okay?  Not going to happen.  Not going to happen.  And if it does, it's the wrong person, okay?  We want this, we want them to go through the steps so that we can overcome their objections,  they can be sold on the process, okay?  So I want you guys to understand that the purpose, the",

So I'm going to go into more detail in later videos throughout this module.  However, I want to tell you the two most important pieces of information that you want to hold  off for the proper time, okay?  Two pieces.  Now, there's going to be a lot of things, I don't want you guys talking about extra  stuff and talking about SEO and backlinks and this is how we get it and all this stuff.  Keep it simple, okay?  That should go without saying, there's two things I don't want you talking about right  here.  And number one is I don't want you talking about price, okay?  And number two is I don't want you talking about the structure of the deal.  And so what I mean by that is we all know that this is called flat fee mastery.  The goal is, and the only thing we're going to sell is a flat fee deal, but I'm telling  you right now, if on that first call you start telling them, yeah, it's really awesome.  We don't do paper lead.  We don't do commission.  We just do this flat thing where it costs you the same every month, okay?  You might be sold on it.  You might be excited, but if you tell them this at the wrong time without explaining  why properly and at the right time, you're going to lose them.  And all of a sudden you're going to go, oh my gosh, they seem so interested and then  I called them back with some leads and they ghosted me.  It's because you spooked them.  In their heads they hear flat fee and they hear, oh man, that's all the risk.  I don't know this guy.  I don't know this lady.  Like, I don't want to pay a flat fee.  I want to pay commission.  As most of these people, when you initially call them, they're down to do commission,  okay?  And they might be down to do paper lead, but most of them are not comfortable with flat  fee because they don't understand it.  So if you start talking about flat fee from the get, you're going to lose them.  So when they start asking you, because at some point they might start asking you, say,  so how does this work?  Do I pay you per job?  Or, hey, that sounds good.  Let me just pay you per job.  Don't freak out.  Just say, hey, look, I'm not worried about that.  Let me get you a couple of leads and then let's talk.  Again, sell dinner, not marriage, okay?  Same thing when they start asking price.  A lot of these guys or these ladies, when you call them, they're going to say, okay,  so like how much is this going to cost, like whatever?  And I'm telling you, I know that you're going to want to say, oh, it's probably going to  be about a thousand bucks a month.  When you have it in the wrong context, sounds like a ton of money, but a thousand bucks  a month in the right context, explained the right way is nothing.  And that's the way we want to do it.  We want to make sure to show them all the value, show them how much money they're going  to make and then show them price.  But if you do that thousand bucks a month and you compare it to a cell phone, yeah,  it seems expensive, okay?  So my word of advice is this.  If somebody starts asking",

All I want you to do is make it seem like not a big deal and let them know, you know,  let's talk about that later, but let's not put the cart before the horse.  So my go-to is, hey, look, they say, hey, so what's this going to cost or, hey, let  me give you a quick, you know, let me give you a percentage.  Look, hey, honestly, sir, honestly, ma'am, I don't want to put the cart before the horse.  I don't even know if this is going to be a good fit for both of us.  So let me do this.  Let me get you a couple of leads and then we can talk in a couple of days.  And just so you know, I'm very flexible.  I'm very creative.  I'm not worried.  That's the easy part.  Let me just earn your trust and let's make sure this is a good fit and then we can work  this out.  But I'm not that stressed.  Okay.  Heck.  And sometimes I'll even joke like, heck, I'll take food stamps, like, you know, ha ha ha.  Okay.  Guys, sell dinner, not marriage, and just take the pressure off.  You know damn well you're going in for the flat fee deal at a certain price.  You already know that, but you don't need to add added pressure to the deal because  pressure is not something that helps a deal at this point in the deal.  Okay.  So recap, we're selling dinner, not marriage.  Do not share too much information.  And if you're going through this for the first time, you're going to be like, what are you  talking about?  I promise you, you need to know this because at some point you're going to start selling  deals and then you're going to go to what's called a slump and it ain't slump.  You're just sharing too much information.  You're talking out of order.  You're sharing information that needs to be held on until later.  Sell dinner, not marriage.

    "pageContent": " Okay, Simon has an interesting question.  He says, what do you think about e-comm  with the digital asset approach?  Can he do it?  Guys, my answer to this is whether you're asking me  about pull barns, whether you're asking me  about assisted living leads,  whether you're asking me about whatever,  if you use this strategy, which is getting paid traffic  or organic traffic to a landing page or to a website,  you are going to get leads or conversions.  Because if you're selling a product,  the same principles apply.  However, the thing that makes this model so special  is the fact that we can use a generic website.  And if, let's say our client starts to get sideways on us,  they start to get a little funny, they start to complain,  we can sell those leads to somebody else.  So if you do e-comm, let's say you go to a company  and they're like, hey, I want you to sell  these water filters for us, right?  And you're doing all this SEO for these water filters.  That's great, but first of all, first and foremost,  you're probably gonna be doing SEO on like a national level,  which makes it very difficult.  It's gonna be much more difficult to get SEO,  to rank using SEO, to get organic rankings.  The other thing, guys, is that company's kind of gonna  have you buy the balls, right?  Because if you're advertising their products  and you're using their branding or their location  or their specific keywords that they wanna target,  what happens if they don't wanna buy leads anymore?  So you have to remember that one of the best parts  about this business model is the ability  to have complete control over our assets  and not have to be at the mercy of anybody.  And this kind of defeats the purpose of it.  So could it work?  Yes.  Do I recommend it?  No.  If it's your own brand and it's your own e-comm products,  your own e-comm store, your own products,  then okay, fine, use the SEO principles  in the second half of the training  to get your website ranked.  But to do it for somebody else,  I don't think it's the move.",

    "pageContent": " All right, we have two different type of ad accounts within Google, and those two are  your just regular standard Google Ad account, Google Adwords account, and your what they  call MCC, and I believe that stands for My Client Center.  I could be wrong, and I don't care, okay, but I prefer to use the MCC.  I'm going to talk about both really quick.  The regular standard one, if you've never set up ads, you're going to be by default  be pushed over to that one, and what that is is basically you can set up one account,  and you can set up multiple campaigns underneath that one account.  The reason I like the MCC account is, well, I plan on doing this for real.  I plan on doing this big time, number one, but number two, it's just like an organizational  thing, so what I like to personally do is I like for every single project, I like to  have a new account and a new campaign.  It's just really nice, let's just say I'm doing Minneapolis Concrete, then I'm going  to create a new account.  I'm going to show you guys all this.  I'm going to create a Minneapolis Concrete account, and then I'm going to be able to  create a campaign within that one that's Minneapolis Concrete, and it's the campaign.  It's just a nice organizational tool so that I don't have to go in, it's one account, it's  just this smorgasbord of stuff.  However, I would prefer you to go fast, so if you're somebody that's never set up ads,  I would prefer you to just, whatever pops up when you go to Google, just set one up,  get them running, and we can go in later and switch the MCC account.  I don't want you slowing down.  That's the biggest thing.  I don't want you slowing down for anything.  Now, really, really quick, because I'm going to share my screen in just a moment.  In version 1.0, I use a regular Google Ad account, so for this training, I'm going to  use an MCC account.  If you're somebody that's new and like, oh my gosh, what does it look like if it's regular?  Just go and look at version 1.0.  I'm going to leave that in the Facebook group.  Go to the module 3, the digital steroids, and you'll see an example of setting it up  with just a regular Google Ad account that comes as default.  I want to show you an MCC account to be fair to those that have MCC accounts.  Lastly, if you have a regular account or you set up a regular account, you just need to  get in touch with Google.  I know they're a pain in the butt to reach, but to my knowledge, that's the easiest way  is you're going to find a number.  I'm going to see if I can find a number, put it in the description of a quick way to reach  It's always changing.  Plus, we're blaming it on COVID, and I honestly don't know.  It's always adjusting.  Get a hold of them and tell them you want to switch to an MCC account, and they'll do  it for you.  Okay?  I'm going to share my screen now.  All right.  Guys, quickest, easiest way, go to Google, and you're going to be blown away.  Type in Google AdWords.  Google AdWords.  Really, really simple.  Okay?

Okay?  First thing I'm going to teach you to do is just to set up a new account.  Okay?  Very, very simple.  Again, we're talking about inside of an MCC account, so if you have your own, you have  a different regular Google, if yours looks different than this, it's okay.  We just need to get an account set up.  Okay?  Really, really simple.  If you do have an MCC account, just click on, you guessed it, accounts, and then you  see this plus sign.  What would you think you would get?  If I were to hold a gun to your head, you'd probably be like, yeah, I probably want to  hit the plus.  Push the plus button.  Okay?  Then it's going to say, create new manager account, nope, create new account.  I don't want a new manager account.  That's the MCC account.  I just want a new account.  Okay?  Set one up for the project that we are currently doing with this example.  Okay?  So, next thing that you're going to do is you're just going to put in a little bit of  information.  Okay?  So, on the account name, I just like to keep it really clean, and I like to put Queen Creek  Concrete.  Go figure.  Okay?  All right.  Type.  Now, this is where you need to pay attention.  Okay?  I'm going to have you do the smart campaign type, okay?  Trust me on this.  I know there's some of you guys that have been in the game forever, and you're like,  oh, I'm not going to do that because blah, blah, blah.  If you guys already know Google Ads like the back of your hand, then be my guest, but  if you've never run Google Ads, trust me, I understand if you look online, it's going",

You're going to choose smart campaign account.  Boom.  Okay?  Select your country.  I don't care what country you're in.  Select your country.  I'm in the U.S., obviously.  Select your time zone.  Okay?  Honestly, I don't know if the way to do it is to select the time zone of the project,  whatever.  Typically, with this, what I understand is if you're going to do it by certain times,  and we're not going to mess that, so it doesn't matter.  I will probably do it as Phoenix time just for the heck of it.  Okay?  Select your currency, and then we're not going to invite any users, so just save and continue.  Okay?  Now, it says you're about blah, blah, blah, okay.  You're making important changes to your account.  Keep your data safe.  Please confirm it's really okay.  It's going to confirm.  Okay.  So, now my account is set up, and I have so many, I like to just filter this and go name,  and I'm going to do Queen Creek, and here we are, ready, set, go.  So, guys, we've now successfully set up an account within our MCC My Client Center account.  If you are just using regular, like it's your first time logging in on that email, it's  probably already going to have an account set up.  If not, just push new account.  It's very, very easy to do.  Again, if you do not have an MCC, it's okay, and on version 1.0, I use a regular account,  so don't overthink it.  Don't stress it.  We are going to go and set up a campaign.",

So to make sure everyone understands this question guys,  he's talking about like, if you wanna start cold calling  without doing the leads in advance,  which is totally doable, right?  I mean, people do it all the time.  I think that it can be done.  I wouldn't recommend it.  If you're new, I wouldn't recommend it.  Some of you guys might be looking at, go, well,  if I do that, then I could save a little bit of money.  It's like, it's so much easier with leads  that I don't recommend it, right?  However, if you decide,  cause I know Shane's gone pretty far  and he's 10,000 a month plus.  He knows what he's doing.  Maybe he wants to just kind of try his hand in it.  That Shane, it's simple is I'm using,  I'm selling through my other customers.  I'm showing, I'm over showing examples.  I'm using everything I say is not what I say.  It's what Joe, my duct cleaning client said.  It's what Marianne, my tow truck client said.  We call it selling through the neighbors, right?  And I'm referring over and over and over.  You know, anything they have, any question,  you gotta use the neighbors.  You gotta use your business owners.  That's it, you have to.  You're gonna have to show a lot of examples.  That's gonna be the trust, right?  When you give leads in advance,  that's how you overcome the objection of trust.  But if you don't have leads in advance,  then you have to use other means.  And so I would say selling through your customers,  using stories, using screenshots of text messages,  pulling up call rail and showing them,  hey, here's what this guy did.  Here's how many leads he got.  That's basically the only way  you're gonna be able to do it.",

This is one of the problems with giving away  free leads, right? Is they don't value it because I can guarantee if it was a lead that they got  from their own website or their own marketing or from even home advisors that they paid for,  they probably wouldn't be complaining. The only thing that I can say is that try to find out  upfront what it is that they're looking for and just let them know. Just like I talked about with  Luke just now, just let them know, say, hey, not all of these are going to be fat, juicy deals.  What are you looking for? What's your best? What's your second best? What's your third best?  What do you not want? And I'll try to get you as many good ones as I can and try to filter out  these other ones. But here's what I always let people know is like, yeah, I get it. That happens.  It's just part of the game. And I'll always mention that's the beauty of how we structure  these deals. I won't tell them flat fee. I'll say the beauty of the way that we're going to  structure this deal once we talk, and I know we're not going to talk right now, but when we do,  these type of jobs, when they come in, you don't have to run these jobs. You can do whatever. You  could throw them away. You give them away. You cannot answer the phone. It's going to be up to  you. We have a really nice deal structure that's going to allow you to do that. And in the back of  my mind, I'm thinking, oh, I'm going to do flat fee. And they don't have to run them because  they're not feeling like they're getting charged for every single lead because it's all included  in the same price. So I use that as just a way to make the flat fee even sweeter. But I don't bring  it up. I don't say, yeah, that's why we do flat fee. And I just say, hey, this is the beauty of  the way we structure this deal, which by the way, I'm going to talk about when we zoom here,  but yeah, if you don't like that, just don't run it. We'll get you another one, right? It's,  but again, I'm just giving you free leads, but they cost you nothing. So you may as well run it.  You may as well run it. It costs you nothing, right? That's what I would do.",

We're going to be, um,  kind of helping you guys out and getting a jumpstart on transferring  and, uh, we're not transferring, but, uh,  Setting up search campaigns like we've talked about.  Um,  So that's kind of going to be what we're doing today.  Um,  we'll let a few more people get on board here and we'll get started.  Obviously this video will stay on Facebook.  So there shouldn't be a problem with that.  Um,  Everyone will be able to get it.  We're trying to set up a simple search campaign for you guys  to be able to use on your one pagers.  And we're going to try to make it.  Um,  As kind of fast and simple as we can.  We're probably not going to, uh,  dive deep into a lot of the explanations.  We're just going to kind of show you how to do it.  So you could do it on some of yours.  Um,  And we'll take a few questions as we go.  But the goal is to kind of have this up and running.  Um,  let it sit there on the Facebook group and then you guys can kind of  jump in and take a look at it.  Uh, right now we, we've done some longer formatted ones, um,  that are being edited and kind of chopped up to make it a little,  uh,  easier to digest.  And then what we'll do is as these things roll out and we get more  questions and stuff,  we'll see where we need to explain more and stuff like that.  So we'll probably do like a more polished, uh,  version of everything at some point. Um,  but we want to get you guys going on with stuff and at least give you  something to work with. And then we'll just keep,  we'll just keep polishing it up, making it easier for you guys. So,  uh, all right. Well, with that, um,  we'll let our special guests come on. Francesca, are you there?

Yeah. So I've been working with Nick for,  I'm going to my fifth year and I'm running like the agency side for  him pretty much.  I'm sure some people have talked to me on the application as well.  So when they first applied,  I'm the one that answers those as well for anyone that,  you know, has joined since, um, April, I would say.  Some people shouldn't know me or at least I've heard my voice.  Okay. Good. Good. Um, so anyway, so just for you guys, um,  so Francesca kind of runs, uh,  most of Nick's ads and stuff like that, like she said, she's kind of the, uh,  she's the one who makes sure that place runs and keeps going. Um,  so we've been working together for probably like the last five, six months.  And, uh, we've been testing a lot of stuff, seeing what works,  what's not working.  And so that's what we're doing today is to try to show you guys some,  um, simple search campaigns. So with that,  we've about seven people on we're going to go ahead and start rolling.  And we're going to see how well this goes. So,  so bear with us. And, um, we, to save some time,  we've preloaded a few things. Um, I'm just going to touch on them.  They're pretty simple things that I preloaded.  It's just so you guys don't have to watch me typing and things like that.  So it's just to save a little bit of time on your end.  So you don't have to watch typing and things like that. Okay.  Um, like that reminds me before we get started here,  I forgot I got to live this up to give me one second, guys.  I just want to get this going here.  Okay.  Sorry. I forgot to bring up the keyword planner.  All right.  Yeah.  So.  Yeah.  Let me just, let me just plug this in real quick.  Okay.

I've just, uh,  like I said, we're just trying to save some time and I'm just going to show  you how to, how we do some things and just have to set some certain stuff  up.  Okay.  Okay.  I think we're ready to go here.  All right. Cool.  All right.  So I'm just going to show you how to save some time.  Okay.  Okay.  I think we're ready to go here.  All right.  Cool.

So here we go, guys.  We are going to hop in and, um,  Set up a search campaign today for you guys.  Um, there's two different types of main search campaigns.  Um, there's one called, uh, like a call only, like a call ad.  And then there's the standard, like webs, uh,  website traffic or like a, like a click to call ad where somebody clicks on  your website and then they click over.  Um, and do that. So we're",

Um, with that, I'm going to, I'm going to get on my phone real quick.  Uh, or Francesca, can you see the Facebook group on your end?  Are you able to monitor that?  I am not on Facebook. Let me, let me go in real quick.  Okay. That way, if you see some comments come up or something since.  Yeah.  Okay.  If you see any comments, just let me know.  Okay. So guys, so what we're doing, so we're in the, uh, MCC account here.  Uh, we went up and we set up, you guys,  this is all the same as the trainings we went and we set up a new sub  account.  Um, so we're setting up, uh,  this is a client that reached out to you guys.  You guys didn't do a prospecting for it.  This is an inbound person that came to, uh, Nick's, uh,  agency and wants them to help them get leads for duck cleaning in the  New Orleans, uh, area, um, in region.  So we're going to set up that campaign today for you guys.  And you guys get to kind of watch how this is going to go.  So what we did is we set up the sub account and we go to,  we click on that and now we're here in this screen.  So that's the same as the training. You guys get to this spot.  Now you want to set up a new campaign.  So click on new campaign.  Okay.  Since we want to focus on a call only ad.  Okay.  We're going to use, take advantage of the leads.  We're going to select leads.  Call.  And then we're going to click.  Right here at search.  Okay.  We're going to do website visits.  It's going to ask.  For our.  Our website.  Um, do you know if the, uh, has it been HTTPS yet?  Does it have that SSL on it?  Yeah.  Let me try that.  Okay.  And then we're going to go here.  And it's going to give us these four different, um,  lead conversion goals.  And we're going to click right here.  Phone calls from your ads.  And then I just like the name of this.  So we're just going to call this.  No.  Okay.  I'm going to ask you, do you want to focus on conversions or clicks?  Um,  You can, you can set up conversions if you want.  I kind of like clicks right now.  Um, but.  It's not a huge issue one way or the other,  but I prefer to do clicks may just be the way I was trained to do it or  whatever.  Okay. And now what we want and something for search campaigns is we  can set.  Um,  Um,  The reason for this is like,  You don't want to get into a bidding war where you're doing like $30,  like keyword clicks or something like that.  Okay.  Okay.  All right.  Love you.

So if you guys go to tools and setting.  You, you hit keyword planner.  Okay.  And I paste it in our top four key keywords here.  I set my location up for the new Orleans, uh, area.  Okay. And it's given me.  Um,  And then it's given me the low range and the top, uh, high end range.  Okay.  And you can see here, there's a pretty good, I mean, look at this one.  It's like a $15 difference between the low and the high end.  And stuff like that.  Uh, this one's, you know, from seven 50 to $24.  So, um,  they know that air duct cleaning is a very, uh,  expensive competitive niche now, especially like post COVID.  Where people are more and more into it.  Okay.  Okay.  Um, so.  We're, um,  We're we're looking at this.  Um,  what we want to do is we want to be on the high end of our top of page  bid.  But because these are so, so, so, so high.  Um,  we just got to try to figure out like a happy medium for right now.  Okay. And we can always adjust it.  But kind of looking at like, I'm seeing a lot of like.  So we're looking at the top of the page bid.  Okay.  And I'm not going to go into the top of the page bid.  I'm not going to look into the top of the page bid,  but it's definitely a high end.  So I'll just go for $4.  But I look on the low end and I'm seeing, you know,  seven, eight, nine, $10, stuff like that.  So what we'll do is to kind of play it safe.  What we'll do is we'll set something.  That's a little under those really high ends,  but it's definitely way over the low end.  So for right now, what we'll do is we'll choose 13.  76.  Okay.  There's really no science behind that, but.  We're going to.  That's the maximum we're willing to do for a click. Okay.  I'm just showing you guys how you set this up.  Obviously, do we want to set up ads in New Orleans?  Probably not, right?  But this is a client that reached out to them  that wants to do business, that's already paying them.  Francesca and them know what they're doing.  They already told them like, hey, it's an expensive area.  It's going to do duh.  Like they set up a big contract.  They got enough room to play here in this space, okay?  But for you guys, if you guys are seeing  those big variations,  you just kind of want to choose something,  but you definitely don't want to be on this low end, okay?  You want to be somewhere in the middle.  If everything's equal and these are like $6, $7 higher,  what I recommend then is doing one penny higher.  That's my recommendation for that.  Okay, enough of that.  Okay, now we go here, we hit next, right?  And this is where they're going to try to trick you again.  But now we finally get to opt out of the display network.  And",

So you want to uncheck these two right here  because you only want to play on the search network now.  I don't care about these other ones, right?  We want to save, we want to get rid of those clicks, okay?  Now it's going to ask you for a location.  So we're going to say enter another location.  Now this particular client has some particular locations.  So what we're going to do  is we're going to click advanced search, okay?  And then what it's going to do is it's going to give us,  because of the towns that they want to target,  we've already kind of looked at this.  So we're going to choose radius, okay?  So we're going to do a radius.  I'm going to do about five miles  in between each of these cities.  And we can always go back and adjust this later.  So I'm looking for Gonzales, Louisiana.  And I can bump this out to more.  We're going to keep that at five.  And we're just going to kind of see how this,  how this works for us here.  Okay.  And again, we can go back later and adjust these,  but just to kind of give you guys an idea  of how we're setting this thing up a little bit in this area.  And the reason why we're doing a radius  and not like an exact city is because  when you get on the outskirts of New Orleans,  it's a little more rural,  but obviously the city of New Orleans  is going to be a lot more dense.  So we're going to choose these here.  And then, oh, it's all right.  We got the one more.  We got it.  Hang on a second.  I have to figure out the spelling of that one again.  They'll chase, no wonder why it's not.  I don't know.  All right, let me see that.  There it is.  Okay.  Now see how that kind of gets in here.  Like we can reduce that one if we find that this is too dense,  but we're going to leave it for now.  So these are going to be our main locations  that the customer wants to target.  So they actually want to kind of target  around New Orleans, which is good.  Okay, so that's how we're setting that up.  And then you want to click here where it says location.  Click here where it says location options.  The default is going to be presence or interest, okay?  This is going to show you,  this is going to be wasteful ad spend.  So we want to make sure that we select people  that are in or regularly in those targeted locations  because that's where homeowners and business owners are.  Not tourists, not people driving through, stuff like that.  So we always want to check that.  It just helps save for better click searches.  English is our language.  Audience segments, we don't need to really worry about  for what we're doing.  We want to go here and more settings.  These are the default.  So we can tweak some of these or we can leave them the same.  I prefer to let Google best optimize whatever,  like the best performing ads  instead of me having to try to control it  because it just takes too much time and maintenance  and stuff like that.  So the default is this.  That's what we want to make sure.  We're going to start today with no end date.",

We're going to type in the quotes as a phrase match  and the brackets are exact match.  We only want to use phrase match for right now.

Okay, there we go.  Zoom thing was in my way.  Okay, I'm going to copy all these.  I'm going to delete.  And then I'm going to paste my own.  Okay, so this is from our own research.  These are the ones I want to run phrase match on  and we're going to go with that.  Okay, now we're going to get into setting up our ad.  Now, because this is a call only ad,  we only get a couple of headlines  and a couple of,  oh look, it's going to give us more this time.  Awesome.  So we're just going to fill it out  with like just a few basic ones  and then just to save time here,  but you can optimize it as much as it'll give you, okay?  So we're going to go here.  We have our website.  You can kind of see that it kind of started auto-filling it,  but we're going to stick to like what we're trained on, right?  So, right, so what we're trained on is, right,  city and service main keywords.  So we're going to do New Orleans.  We're going to see if I can get,  let's see if I can get, oh, look at that, perfect.  Okay, what's the next one?  Get a hundred percent free, right?  So,  that'd be awesome, a hundred percent free.  Can you just put estimate?  Well, it's only for 30 characters, so.  Yeah, just like get a hundred percent free estimate  without the duck cleaning.  Yeah, I think that's what we're going to have to do.  I tried though, okay.  Yeah, I know.  Okay.  Dryer vent cleaning.  Let me see what I should just do this.  Okay.  Okay, so we're going to just do",

So the descriptions, right,  we're just going to stick to what the training,  it still works, right?  So we go here, we copy that.  So we're going to do,  we're going to play with that a little bit.  So we specialize in.  And like Jeff said,  you want to complete as many headlines as they give you.  We're just doing it quickly.  So we're not wasting everyone's time,  but you want to, obviously if you're doing it yourself,  same with the descriptions, you have four.  So we're just probably going to fill out two,  but you want to complete as much as you can.  Okay.  That's probably good there.  And then we're going to do, right, we're going to do this.  Okay, and again, guys, we're doing this  because we're trying to make this right  as down and dirty as possible.  So,  I'm going to see, I think I can get,  if I can get that in, right,  I might be able to get cleaning on that.  It's in the area.  Cool.  All right.  So we're going to leave those there, okay?  Your local, affordable,  professional air ducting experts.  Okay, great.  Okay.  And then from there, like that's kind of that.  Okay, again, we'll come back in here  and we'll clean these up and add more  to increase the strength, okay?  So just for time for you guys,  we don't need to spend time doing that right now,  but we'll do that later after the live.  So I'm going to hit done.  You don't need to worry about all those call-outs  and site links and all that stuff.  We'll get into that stuff later,  but don't worry about that for right now.  Now it's going to ask for our daily budget.  Now it doesn't give you the recommendation anymore, right?  So I'm going to move us here.  Zoom so I can see here.  So what we'll do is we'll click here.  So obviously some of the clicks were like high up there.  So we're going to see what it does at $25.  We're going to see what it gives me.  So at $25, it's telling me I can expect about 22 clicks.  It's going to cost me about $160 a week  and this is my average CPC.  So that's not terrible, right?  If you're getting that many clicks  and potential calls a week,  obviously if I went up to like say $55,  it's probably going to give me,  looks like it's giving me the same results, okay?  Let's try like $75, let's just see what it does.  So that's great.  That if that's all good,  we're going to try to bump it down to 20  and see what it does, only 21.  So like, that's not bad.  Let's see if I do 15 and it tells me that's too low.  Okay, so we're going to start at $20  because that seems to be a decent amount, right?  I think anybody would be happy with  that many clicks per week for right now.  And let me move this back up here.  The optimization score at first,  don't worry about that.  That's something that I'll kind of explain in a",

    "pageContent": "second,  but don't worry about this right now.  It can get better if you add better headlines  or more headlines and more descriptions and things like that.  So we'll fix that later.  And we're going to do another training series  where we'll go over that,  but don't worry about that for right now.  Okay, so now we go here.  It's going to, we're going to just double check everything  that it's a search campaign.  Sometimes if you forgot to uncheck one of those boxes,  it'll tell you search display and other stuff.  We're doing leads, phone call leads,  we're maximizing clicks.  We're on the Google search network, none of the others.  We have our different locations,  our language, everything here.  All day is 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. and $20 a day.  And we're like, cool, let's go ahead and publish it.  So this ad now goes into what's called a policy review.  Okay, this will take a couple of days.  Okay, and then it should go live.  And then once it goes live,  you're going to be in this thing called bid strategy learning.  Okay, and this takes about five days.  So it takes about seven days for like the ad  to get really warmed up.  So two days to go through policy review  and then about five or six days  of like actually running to do that.  So, but this gets you up and running  and you'll get, you'll definitely gonna be reducing  those really cheap crappy clicks on YouTube,  search partners and stuff like that.  So those are gonna go away.  What you're gonna see is you're gonna see  a lot less impressions because we're only on the one network  for a handful of specific keywords.  So you should have better quality clicks now,  which is what you want, right?  We just set one up the other day  that we're gonna go back and do some filming on.  And I mean, Francesca, what was our estimated daily spend  between the two is like $50 something per day  is what we set it up for.  I know the total for like the month.  Well, I think the daily budget we set up  to be like $45 a day.  Yeah, there's two different ads and we were doing it,  but like our actual spend has been like,  what, maybe the most like $15 in a day.  So way under and they're getting way less impressions  because they're getting more quality impressions.  So the clicks they're getting are a lot more quality.  And that's a great thing  because you're not wasting the ad spend  and you're getting people that are actually looking  for your business.  So.  And yeah, and like we talked,  this ads are something that you kinda wanna keep an eye on  especially the first week,  but it's better to like have it higher and don't get scared.  Like just check in and see how much you're actually spending,  but then you can go and trim it back.  Yes.  Yeah.  Okay.  So I think we covered what we wanted to cover again.  This is for a call only ad.  We'll do another one maybe next week  where we do a click to call ad,  which is the website traffic setting.  It's super similar to this.  It's just, we click another button instead of another.  It's not really a huge difference though,  but we'll set that up just to show you guys.  It's not a huge difference.  It just land differently on the platform.  Okay.  So the",

    "pageContent": "call only ad, just FYI,  like that only like,  you will probably not see a lot of like desktop impressions  and or like tablet impressions.  It really only works on devices  that people can click the call.  So like I'm on my Mac,  I could probably get one  because I can FaceTime call out of it if I click.  But what's cool about that is that  it's definitely going to show more on phones.  And that's where most people are calling from anyways, right?  So anyhow, just wanted to throw that out there  and that should help you guys get your phones ringing.  So Francesca, do you have anything  you think we needed to review or cover?  No, I think you did awesome.  The only thing that was kind of weird for me at first,  so I kind of want to throw it out there so people know.  And what we mean by having like a call ad  and then a website ad,  they're all going to be under the same account.  It just means like we set, we go more into depth,  a little bit more advanced than a smart campaign.  And we set up the call ad  and then a separate one under the same account  for the actual website.  Well, doing a smart campaign,  you're letting Google do that for you pretty much, right?  Jeff, is that?  Uh, yes, yeah.  He just kind of makes it into a big mixing bowl  and we're trying to have a little bit more power  and then make it more detailed.  I don't know how else to describe it, but hopefully.  Yeah.  Well, this gets us back to like the original setup  of like the intent of the original smart campaigns  before Google started changing the platform on people.  So this allows everyone to kind of take back  a little bit more control.  And obviously just if you guys start, you know,  try not to play around with the framework too much  if you've not used to it  because you can easily get yourself in trouble.  So we tried to just make this super streamlined,  like click here, do this, do that, don't do that, do this.  We're trying just to keep you guys lined up  and squared away on it.  So you don't get in too much trouble.  That's definitely a potential issue with this.  So hopefully this is helpful  and you guys can be able to use this  for your own campaigns now.  With that, if anybody has any questions on anything,  type them into the Facebook.  I'm not really seeing anything,  but I'm gonna hit refresh here  because that could just be my bad.  So stand by.  But if anybody has any questions on anything,  please type it into the chat  and we'll give you guys a second here.  I'm not seeing anything.  Are you, Francesca?  No.  Okay.  We'll give it a minute.  We'll pin this, right?  So people can watch and pause it while you get started  and then we'll do the website one soon.  Yeah.  Yeah, definitely.  Yeah, we'll get into that.  Okay, someone, oh yeah, should we put negative keywords?  You can, you don't have to right away.  There are some that you want to,  like you go like cost, how to,  depending on what you wanna do,  like cheapest ideas.  It's probably like the main ones off the top of my head  that you wanna load in there first.  And then what'll happen is like after a handful of days,  you'll start seeing, right?  Because there's three different types of",

    "pageContent": "keywords, right?  There's broad match, phrase match and exact match.  Broad match is trash, we want that out.  Exact match can be good,  but they have to type in exactly like what you put in there.  So phrase match is good because like,  let's say I'm doing like landscaping.  Well, if I put landscaping as a phrase match,  then it could be like anything landscaping  will show an ad in that region.  So there might be ones where like you see something  and you just take like that one word before or after  and you throw that into the negative keyword list.  But it's definitely a lot easier to manage  than it was with the smart campaign.  So in theory, that should keep a bunch of the legions  from clicking into our ads  since most of them are coming from desktop and those.  Like I think you're talking about like Angie's  and thumbtack and all them.  They will probably be able to still click them,  but it will probably reduce it.  But those guys are spending millions of dollars  to beat the spammers and all the protections and all that.  So hopefully it'll reduce it a little bit,  but it's just part of the game now, unfortunately.  All right, are there any other questions?  I know it's the delay, huh?  I don't see anything, but we'll see.  Yeah, all right, we'll just give them a minute.  Like I said, there's like, there's this weird delay.  It's taken me a while to get used to.  Okay, here we go.  So Alex says, we have an ad we set up  under the Google smart campaign.  We received 520 clicks,  47, almost 48,000 impressions.  Yeah, it's six months of the cost.  We received no calls and of course, we,  yeah, it's just starting to turn and move on.  I would try to redo it,  but if you're getting that many clicks  and really low CPC like that,  I would bet that you probably have the budget  set too low for the smart campaign.  But what you can do is just pass the ad  but what you can do is just kind of pause that.  You probably have a lot of the good stuff already loaded  like your keywords and your locations  and your headlines and descriptions.  And I would just create a new search campaign  and then just set up the call campaign with the leads  and just set that up.  And you'll probably notice a significant drop  in impressions.  You're gonna notice a significant drop in clicks.  However, you're going to get a higher CPC  but you're gonna get better click-throughs.  Got it, thanks, you're welcome.  Okay.  Sorry, I need some weird people emailing me right now.  Okay, Francesca, do you have anything else to add?  No, I don't.  I think this is a good start.  It'll get everyone to be able to set them up  at least this first part, like the call ad  and then we'll go more in depth into the website one  and the webpage one, sorry, and everything else.  Yeah, definitely.  Like I said, everybody, next week we'll go in here,  probably use the same one and we'll set up the one  for the click to call ads,  which is the website traffic thing.  It's literally pretty much the same process.  There's just a couple of small tweaks on it.  We just wanted to show you guys the fast, easy way  to get this going and get on it.  So I don't really see a lot of people on,",

And once this kind of uploads and processes,  we'll go ahead and make sure it gets pinned to the top  or put in the files or something like that.  And we'll do that.  So Francesca, thank you as always for your expertise  and helping out.  Thank you, Jeff.  Hopefully this helps.  I think it will.  I think a lot of people are gonna be pretty stoked on it.  Like if they implemented it tomorrow,  by the time the weekend's over,  they'll be out of policy review.  And by Monday, Tuesday, they should start seeing some calls.  And just like we've seen on the one we set up for you,  that was just a little over a week ago now,  like eight days or so.  Like did you notice yesterday,  like a lot more clicks and calls yesterday?  We got one lead today.  Yeah.  Okay, yeah.  So we're already seeing,  like we can watch the uptick already.  Like as it comes out of that policy review  and that learning strategy,  you can start seeing it kind of hit its groove,  which is really common to the same thing.  That was the same thing with the smart campaigns, right?  It has to go through a few days.  That's why we always say,  hey, let things go for a couple of weeks.  With this stuff,  there's gonna be a little more maintenance off the top,  but it's a simple thing.  And we'll go over that maybe next week as well.  So, cool.  All right, everybody.

    "pageContent": " Okay, so now, talking about content, we need to expand our keyword list.  The reason why we do that is because we want to have as many keywords as possible when  we're writing content, that way we're not using the same keywords over and over.  And we want to have an expanded, nice keyword list for each website and each project we're  going into.  So we personally use Basecamp.  We don't necessarily recommend it, we got a free account for it, so that's why we're  using it.  But again, as long as you have, wherever you're keeping your keyword list, just make sure  you're making a copy and you're putting this under your website that we're going after.  So in my case, it would be Queen Creek, Arizona, Concrete.  And this is the keyword list, okay?  So we usually have about 20 to 30 keywords, and this is the very basic list for Concrete.  Now I'm sure this is going to look different than your Concrete list.  And again, like we said earlier, when we were building the website, Concrete is a little  broad and a lot of companies will do different things.  Some companies do coding, other companies do not do crack repair.  So just make sure you're checking in with your client and follow up on what it is they're  doing.  Usually the main services are going to be stamped concrete, concrete driveway, and concrete  patios.  So those are the ones that you want to focus on most of the time.  These numbers right here that you see, these are taken from SEMrush.  So we use SEMrush, as I said before, you don't need to use it as well.  It's just what we are using.  You can use whatever you want.  And so what we do is we actually plug in each keyword that we have and we see what the volume  in search is just to get an idea on, okay, maybe stamp concrete is super important to  put in our content, right?  Because it seems like it's the most search out of all of them.  And then concrete driveway, it's pretty well searched.  Concrete patios as well.  So that's why we do that, just to kind of get an idea.  So go ahead and plug that in.  And then after you have your basic one, make sure you also put your location.  So concrete companies in blah, blah, blah, New York, Queen Creek, wherever you are trying  to rank.  Okay.  After that, you are going to pick, in our case, our homepage was like concrete contractors,  concrete company.  So I already went ahead and expanded the concrete contractor keyword.  So what I usually do is I actually highlight the, I would say between five to eight keywords  that I'm going to expand on, okay?  So this is usually a short tail keyword, which means it's short tail.  Like I said, very short.  And then there's a long tail keywords and they're both important when it comes down  to ranking.  They're just different.  So a long tail keyword would be like in a full, like a lengthy one.  For example, how much does roof repair cost?  That's a long tail keyword.  And so that's why we like to expand them because we want to try, the whole purpose is to write  a content that includes things that people are searching for.  And people that need a concrete driveway, most of the time will not just type in Google  concrete driveway.  They're going to type something like concrete driveway pricing near me.  And that is a long tail keyword.  So that's what most people are searching for, especially if people are like on their phone  talking",

    "pageContent": "to Siri or anything, they tend to be more lengthy.  So that's why it's important to include short tail keywords and long tail keywords because  most of the time people are typing something more lengthy when they're looking for a service.  And so I'm just going to highlight the keywords that I am going to expand.  So we already did concrete contractor.  I'm going to show you another one.  Let's do concrete driveway.  And usually you want to probably put this in order of importance.  So I would probably put this concrete driveway up here since it's something that I want.  Oops.  Okay, there you go.  And now let's expand concrete driveway.  All right, so now enter and tab, okay.  So how do how we do this?  Once you kind of get the hang of it, you're going to do the same things like you're going  to know that an extension to the concrete driveway concrete patio is going to be like  near me cost residential.  Like some of some of the extensions are always the same.  So they're reoccurring.  So you'll know.  But one thing that it's really easy and I really like to do is just get into the Google  search down here and just type concrete driveway and it's really nice because Google will tell  you will give you ideas, will give you suggestions on where people are searching.  And I like to put a space and then just start with the first letter of the alphabet.  So I put a.  Okay, we don't care for apron alternatives edition and patio.  Okay, average cost could be something and think, think as if you were someone looking  for this service.  So think of, okay, I bought a house, I need a concrete driveway.  What would I search if I had a buying intent on Google?  Okay, average cost seems like someone who is looking to buy.  Okay, nothing else really came to my head more than that.  So let's start with B base border breaking up room finish base preparation.  And again, I would rather put a lot of options there and then you can, it's always faster  to edit and cancel things out other than adding them on later.  So I'm not sure if base preparation, it's more of a DIY things that someone would do  on his own, but we can put that in there and then we'll, we'll do a little more research.  see cost contractors cost per square foot crack repair.  I'm sure there's company and these are kind of already knowing because I've done this  before and companies near me contractors near me.  And again, concrete driveway contractors and concrete driving contractors near me.  They are technically two different long tail keywords.  One is more expensive than the other.  See coding, crack filler and cost calculator.  Cost calculator is a really good one because that really means that someone is wanting  a quote mostly I'm already forgetting crack filler and coding.  Okay, then I put a D designs could be one.  We definitely do not want to put anything that it's DIY other than the only way you  can talk about DIY stuff is if you're saying we do not recommend doing DIY because you  can cause more damage and it's going to end up costing more.  So you could put designs because especially if the contractor is offering stamped concrete,  that may be a good way to kind of showcase the stamped concrete and the kind of design  they can do on the driveway.  Entrance again, think as a buyer, think of you really need or if you can come up with  ideas, ask, ask a friend, ask a family member, say, hey, if you were looking to get a driveway,  what would you search on Google?  What would you, you",

You can even highlight in like a yellow or a green to make sure that you do check in  with the owner of the company if they do actually do coating or, or repair.  Installation installers near me, installation cost.  You can even throw like concrete driveway.  You can put Queen Creek in my case.  You can put like your location, your state, I think I'm missing installation cost.  Leveling, lifting again, you're really wanting to make sure that the company that you're  working for does this.  We definitely want to put them in there and then just highlight them.  You could put makeover.  Seems like someone who's doing maybe a new installation.  Near me, options, overlay.  Okay, I think I already put near me.  Nope, I did not.  Okay.  Options near me is always going to be one of the options for most keywords.  Options near me, overlay, overlay cost on a slope.  Pavers, price per square foot, paving.  The reason why we're putting so many extensions is because when people are searching on Google  something, Google takes people to certain websites because they are trying to match  the intent of what that person is searching to the best results that make answer that question.  If that makes sense.  So the reason why we want to expand and kind of cover as many questions and there's many  options and possibilities because we want to try to gather everyone in the area of Queen Creek.  For us, could be New York or Los Angeles, looking for anything, any of these services to us.  So not just driveway and patio.  We want to gather anyone looking for an installation.  Maybe they are looking for stamped concrete, but they're typing installation.  Maybe they're typing makeover.  So we want to really gather everyone and that's why we expand the keyword list and we try to  anyone that has a buyer intent in that location we want to get.  Repair, rest facing, repair near me, replacement.  Repair near me, replacement.  Again, make sure like something like rest facing.  Not everyone does that.  so make sure that your company actually covers that.  Sealer sounds, I would put Sealing Near Me. Sealer sounds like someone that is trying to  buy something from those. DIY, Sealing Near Me sounds more like a service that needs to get done.  Types, types could be a good option like someone is looking and  you know types could go into stamp and here are the options.  Quotes, quotes near me.  I'm forgetting one letter we're on.  Queen Creek, if I haven't put that in there, I already put it.  You could put vendors.  Okay I think we got most of what we wanted. Okay and that is how you expand a keyword list. Now  you're going to do that. I would usually do whatever we end up doing, putting in the H1  and we'll cover that later when we do on-page SEO. Whatever you want to really cover as a service  page. So remember when we built a website we had a home page. Service page was concrete driveway,  concrete patio, stamped concrete. So I really want to expand concrete driveway.  My next one would probably be stamped concrete right here and the other one concrete patio.  And then I would probably do also concrete company and that's it. So I'm going to highlight these so  you can see them. I would do concrete contractor, concrete driveway, concrete company.

    "pageContent": " Let's get into it.  Before we jump into it, guys, I want to share with you a quick story.  When I was doing door-to-door sales, and I promise I'm going to make this really quick,  when I was doing door-to-door sales, they would literally drop us off in neighborhoods  and we would just start knocking doors.  And I am not the sharpest tool in the shed, as they say, but I learned really quickly  If I would just knock on the homes of people who already had security systems, so like  ADT or Monotronics, these different companies, I would look for those security signs.  When I knocked on these houses, in the beginning I didn't do it on purpose, and I knocked on  these houses, it was a really different sale, it was a completely different thing.  I didn't have to convince them that they should get security, I didn't have to convince them  that security was a good idea.  I didn't have them telling me, oh, I have a gun, I have Smith & Wesson, I have a dog,  it's a safe neighbor.  I didn't have these objections because they were already paying for security.  So what was cool is I would knock on these doors, and my pitch was very simple, it was  like, I would knock and I would say, hey, my name's Nick, blah blah blah, I'm with this  company right here, I know you're already paying for XYZ service and I already know  how much you're paying, what we're doing for everybody in the neighborhood is we're just  upgrading them, we're giving them a camera, we're giving them a door lock, we're giving  them this, we're upgrading their system, it's the same price per month, roughly, and we're  going to put you on a phone app, can I step inside and show you what this looks like on  paper?  And that was it, and I was right inside the house, we were talking numbers.  It wasn't this big emotional sale, it wasn't this long, dry-out thing, it was very, very  cut and dry.  And so what it did, and this is what I want to talk about, is this collapsed time.  I was trying, every single year when I was doing this job, I was like, how do I make  more sales?  How do I make more sales?  And I didn't have the leverage of the internet or any of these tools, it was literally sweat  equity.  How can I get more deals done in less amount of time?  And the way that I was able to do this is by collapsing time, and it was by going after  these type of customers.  Guys, there's three things I want to share here as to why we're going to target people  that are already paying for ads.  Number one is when you call people and you target people that are already paying for  ads, already sold on what you're selling, you only need to make one sale.  What I mean by that is you don't need to call a business owner and convince them that, hey,  Mr. Business Owner, advertising is a good idea.  You don't need to do that because they already know they're already paying for it.  So what it is, all you need to do is you need to let them know, hey, Mr. Business Owner,  here's why you should work with me.  Here's why my product is better than what you're paying for, or not even better than,  but also a good fit, okay?  So you only need to make one sale.  Second reason is you're going to have to talk to less people to get deals.  You're not going",

When you just go and you're targeting and you're prospecting and you just go to Google  and you type in concrete Minneapolis, you're going to have to go through a lot of business  owners to find people that are sold on your product and then sold on you, and it's going  to take a long time.  But when you're specifically targeting people who are already sold, you're going to get  a deal a lot quicker, and you're going to have to go through a lot less heartache, headache,  pain to get to that deal.  Third reason is this, guys.  When you're talking to people that are already sold on what you're selling, they conceptually  understand, okay, I pay for advertising because it's going to get me more business, I understand  what leads are, and so what this does is it allows you to collapse time.  They conceptually understand the concept of paying for advertising, and so these deals  tend to go a lot quicker.  When you're talking to somebody who's never spent money on ads, they've never spent money  on Google Ads, Home Advisor, Angie's List, et cetera, you have to explain everything.  Hey, Mr. Business Owner, this is what cost per click is.  Hey, Mr. Business Owner, this is how a lead is, or this is what a lead is.  Hey, Mr. Business Owner, this is what the customer sees.  Hey, Mr. Business Owner, this is why we're better than Google Ads.  But when they're already paying for advertising, you don't have to do all that.  They conceptually understand it, and these deals tend to go quicker.  So guys, let's go ahead and build the list.",

But once you get good at it,  I typically like, I typically am running about five at a time.  So I have, think about this, like once you get good at this,  I've got five niches, five one-pagers, five ads,  five business owners on the hook.  And I'm probably three to five, okay?  Because think about it, you know, let's take two of those.  It's taken a couple extra days for leads to come in.  One of those, it's working perfectly.  The other two, you know, it's kind of sporadic.  So I'm kind of running like, that's when I have a setter.  I'm usually running five at a time.  I can handle five at a time.  You're probably gonna,  I definitely recommend starting with one,  watching it like a hawk.  Once you close the deal and you feel comfortable,  and maybe you can go to two.  I mean, you gotta be careful, you don't waste money,  you don't waste leads.  But once you get good at it, man, the sky is the limit.  That's what's freaking amazing about this, okay?  Cool.",

    "pageContent": " What are the expectations that we're setting?  There's two different types of expectations, right?  There's expectations in terms of like actual results,  how many leads, how many phone calls,  and then there's expectations in terms of like  when the website's gonna get set up,  when we're gonna be doing this,  we're gonna be doing that,  when things are gonna be live.  What are the expectations  that you are setting with the client?  In terms of like timelines and stuff like that,  I never, and I hate to say this, but I don't promise.  I never say, oh, it's gonna be done  in 72 hours or three days.  I never give them precise answers.  And it's not because I'm trying to be sketchy.  It's because I know from the past that things can happen.  And if I'm 12 hours late or a day late,  I don't want them to think that I'm not reliable.  So I tell them, hey, it's roughly a week,  and then I would rather get it done sooner,  which kind of goes back to how you do sales.  Like you always wanna undersell it.  So that's what I always do.  I don't promise.  If somebody asks like,  how many leads am I supposed to receive?  I never, ever, ever, ever say, oh, a minimum of 10.  Never, because you can't predict that,  and you would be lying if you were telling them,  oh, at least 10, because how do you know  how many people are going to the call?  No matter if you're ranking or not, so.  100%.  And at the end of the day also, it doesn't,  I mean, it does matter how many leads you get them,  but what I always try to,  I always try when I get questions like that,  I try to let them know,  hey, this isn't about how many leads I get you.  This is about how much money you make, right?  Because if I only sent you three leads a month,  but you knew you were gonna close all three of those deals  and you were gonna make X amount of money,  you know, that was gonna be a three X  on the money you're spending with me,  you wouldn't care how many leads.  So at the end of the day, I always like to let them know  and like try to frame it as like,  I care more about how much money they make  than I do about how many leads I'm getting them,  because I know I could get them 100 leads a month,  but if they're not making money,  whether it's my fault or not,  they're going to eventually cancel.  So that's number one.  The other thing you have to just set expectations  that I would just add,  and I think that we do this more during the actual sale  when you're closing the deal,  is I like to let them know,  the reason that we do a six month contract  is because we're gonna take the average of the six months.  Okay, we're gonna take the average  of how many leads came in,  how many deals were closed,  how much money was made,  how much money was put in their pocket  over a six month period.  Because if we look at one month,  let's say we do a deal,  and I always explain this to the business owner,  I say, hey, Mr. Business Owner, it's spring,  we just got tax returns back,  everyone's spending money on cleaning up the yard.  If we do a one",

And of course the answer is no,  because that's gonna be a really good month, right?  And likewise, if it's December,  and I only get you one lead,  because it's Christmas and no one wants to spend,  is it safe to assume that every month  is gonna be like that?  Well, no, of course not.  So, okay, Mr. Business Owner, just so you know,  the reason we're doing this for six months  is I need you to be patient with me.  We're gonna have some months that are gonna be great,  we're gonna have some months  that are not gonna be great,  we're gonna have some days  you're gonna get multiple leads,  we're gonna have some weeks that you get no leads.  But the thing that we're looking at  is the average of the six months.  And so that's why I need you to give me  this six month period.  At the end of the six months,  if you've done your job and I've done my job  and it's just not working,  then trust me, I'll be the first one to cut this thing off.  That's it.  It's the pullback, but it's also just being real.  Like, it's so, sometimes it's so hard to like,  you know, we were getting the deal and we're excited,  and we want every,  we wanna give everyone the best answer, right?  So, you know, people are like,  hey, so, you know, how quickly will you have this done?  And sometimes we're like, we wanna be like,  yeah, it'll be done in two days  because it's been that way before,  but we don't know for sure.  And we somehow wanna impress this client  and we say stupid stuff that keeps like, ties us in.  It's so much better to just pause and go,  you know what, we've done it in as little as a few days,  but just to be realistic with you,  I would plan on like giving us at minimum,  you know, seven to 10 days,  just in case something happens.  I'd rather just, you know, plan on that  and then surprise you.  You have no idea.  Do you know what?  Every single time you do something like that,  it builds trust.  Every time you do that,  you're different than the last person.  You're different than the last person that told you,  hey, we're gonna get X amount of leads  and we're gonna blow it up and blah, blah, blah,  and then nothing ever happened, right?  So, I love what Matthew said  and it's, I would kind of call that a pullback,  but the deal's already done,  but I would just say just being real  and just being like transparent  and giving an honest answer,  instead of like giving the best case,  give the worst case, okay?  And when you do that,  what we think sometimes it's gonna lose us the deal,  it's gonna make it so we're not gonna get the deal.  Actually, it's gonna solidify the deal.  Actually, it's going to make it seem  like we're actually legitimate and we're real  and we're gonna take care of them.",

So on the screen here I brought up this is a this is a good one to look at because this is one where  Nick has a good website that's ranking well and SEO wise it's bringing in enough leads so we've  we've kind of supplemented with a little bit of ad spend during the colder months  and so I want to show you what the numbers that we're seeing here so you can kind of get an idea  of what to look at so your your the answer to the question is going to be in the data  so in the data here what I like to do is I like to pull up where my keywords are  you can also pull this up in in the ads and the assets I like to look at what keywords are landing  where they're landing and you can see here you know this this ad itself has had three total  conversions it's had a little bit more than that but we're going to we're going to look at those  ones that got they got tagged what they're getting tagged for we're looking at the total  impressions here the big thing I'm looking for here is that am I getting impressions  and am I getting a CTR which is the click through rate so in general about five you know four to  four to six percent is considered decent and and you're doing a good job above that is is a really  good job there's people that make millions of dollars a year selling at two to three percent  CTR okay so a lot of it is just about volume but for us for our purposes if you're hitting in the  above six percent on the CTR you're probably doing something good the other the other way to  look at this too is another way to look at it is this search impression rate and if you go to  columns if you don't have that on yours you can go to modify columns here you go to the competitive  metrics right here and you'll see that top left search impression share and then you click apply  and that brings that column up for you and so if this search if this search impression share is  in the higher range or above 50 you're doing really really well and what you can do is you  can use that data if I'm not getting the impressions that I want then I need to look at my my daily  budget and what I'm bidding cpc wise and that's the first place to look the second place to look  is where my CTR is my CTR is in the four percent range then I need to understand why typically  that's going to be a budget issue and or possibly an ad copy issue but if your budget looks good and  the cpc looks good if you go back and look at google google keyword planner and and that is  where it needs to be then I would look at my ad copy next and then after that we look at  search impression share and that tells us how we're doing to our competitors and then we have  the conversion rate after that the conversion rate I'm not too worried about because most of  you are not setting up the conversion tag so it's something you don't really need to worry about  right now but that those are the things that I look at if my impressions are good I have good CTR  I'm doing favorable with the search impression share now I start looking at my landing page  only then do I start looking at my landing page after I've checked my ad copy is my ad  copyright is my ad copy landing for the search terms that I want for the services I'm providing  and you know there's everything working does the number work on it and all those things  and then you want now you want to go start addressing your landing page issue",

And that it's a case by case scenario. He was finally satisfied but is there something better I can say. Great question, Marie, I actually just filmed a video in module five this morning about this.  My go to when they keep going price price price price price guys write this down.

Um, the reason I wanted to shift to this is because,  and I don't know if you guys follow me on, on social media or I don't care if you do,  if you want to, that's great. If you don't, it's fine. But as I've gotten like more into  business, I've realized that quality is always better than quantity. And I think in the beginning,  when I started my Facebook group, definitely when I had my, you know, my social media,  it was always like, how many likes, how many live viewers can you get? How many group members,  all these different things. And that's just kind of natural as humans. And, um, I realized that,  like, I was talking to a lot of people that weren't even interested in taking action.  And so the whole purpose of doing these kinds of calls is I want to give more value on  to be able to give you guys more value. The people that are receptive and are actually  ready to implement what I'm going to teach today, they're ready to take action. You're the ones that  I want to give priority to. So this is the new format going forward. Okay. Now, just because you  were on today's call doesn't mean that you can't be on next week's call, but we are going to be  doing these live every single Monday. Um, and we're going to be doing them at the same time,  just to keep consistent. The only time that would change is if I am in the air, which I'm going to  try not to do a flight on a Monday. So, um, I know it's a little early for some of you guys.  It's like six 30 for MST. I'm in Dubai. So I'm trying to like, it's like a 10 hour difference.  I'm trying to do my best, but, um, really truthfully, I do not care. And Aaron and I,  when we put up this post, we were like, dude, it was, you know, it's our first time doing it.  And we're like, we probably won't have a ton of engagement because we're going to get this post  up late. And we had like 50 plus people that commented. I don't know if all of them got the  link, but, um, I don't really care about how many people are on this call. And I promise you,  even if one of you, I showed up, I'm going to run this call because I prepared for it. And  that's what I'm going to do. So again, like I told you guys, I'm not going to be posting this  anywhere else. That's just going to be here. So, um, keep in mind guys, what I'm going to be sharing  today, uh, it's not going to give you guys a hundred percent of the information that you need  to build a successful digital real estate agency. Um, like there's no way I can cover that in 40  minutes. And I just want to like start with that. There's no way I can cover everything in 40  minutes period. And, and truthfully speaking, that's why we created digital landlords. Everything's on  the inside. However, um, my goal on this call is literally to do exactly what I did, what I used  to build my, my agency, my rank and rent digital real estate agency to seven figures. And you guys  know that like at the, at the core of what I believe is that we always give value before we  even ask",

    "pageContent": "for a conversation before we even ask to like talk about business, talk about doing business  together. We give value and our value is giving them what they want and what they want is our  leads. Right. And so really that like my whole belief is like give ridiculous value upfront,  charge nothing for it, right. Give value. That's so good. Give leads that are so good. They might  even, they hopefully will make money from those leads and like just give them that real,  those real exclusive leads, absolutely free. Right. That's, that's the whole, like that's at  the core of our strategy. And the reason that we do that is because guys, the hardest objection  to overcome, if you've done sales, if you haven't done sales, it doesn't matter, but you'll learn  this. The hardest objection to overcome is trust. I don't care how good your product is, how good it  looks, how good your website is, how nice your polo is and your brand. And if people do not trust  you, they will not buy from you. And that's just the reality. And on, on the flip side, you could  be in your mom's basement. You could look like grungy and not that professional. And if people  trust you, they are going to buy from you. Okay. And so the reason we give the free leads is we  know that the hardest objection to overcome is trust. And that is the very thing that overcomes  trust. So ultimately, when we give leads, our purpose isn't to give leads, just to be a good  person. Our goal is to give free leads so that they will eventually work with us. And that's  the whole strategy. And then we're not hiding that. And I'll tell my business owners, when I call a  business owner, I'm like, Hey, hey, Pete, I want to give you a couple of free leads. Look, just to be  completely straight with you, I want to earn your business. That's my goal here. However, I don't  even want to talk about it until I've given you, until I've let you try out my business at absolutely  no charge. Basically, I'm going to give you some free leads. So guys, I want to let you guys know  upfront that for me, that is no different. I've never hit that. And so at the end of the day,  the reason I have the Facebook group, the reason I add value, the reason I'm doing calls like this  is that I want to earn your business, right? At some point, whether it's digital landlord or  something else that I'm doing, I want to earn your business eventually. Okay. I want you, just like  I want your business owners to be so impressed with your free stuff, with your free leads,  that not only can they not wait to get more, but you leave them or I leave you wondering like, dude,  what would it be like to be able to get on calls with this guy every single week to have access  to this guy every single week to be, have access to that energy every single week inside of his  group, inside of his like inner circle. And so anyway, long story short guys, that is the whole  purpose. And I don't ever want this to come across like I'm this magnificent person that just wants  to give stuff away. No matter what it is, there's always something in it for everybody. And so for  me, I just understand that if you give value upfront without asking for anything,  then the people that are ready will eventually buy. And so that's, that's why I want to do these  more intimate sessions. Cause if you're on this call right now, it's",

So that said guys, if at any time during this, I think what I'll do, Aaron, can you still hear me  by the way? I don't see. Yeah, you're good. Okay. Cool. What I'll have you do is,  yeah. Are you, does it say your co-host still? Yeah. Okay. Then we'll just leave it like that.  Just keep an eye on stuff and then let me know if you see anything come in. Okay. I got you.  Okay. Guys, all that said, just to get that out of the way upfront, we, it is 42. This is probably  going to be, I'd say 25 to 30 minutes. What I'm going to talk about right now, maybe less.  And then I want to have some time for some questions. Okay. So I want to get right into  what I want to talk about today. And essentially what I want to do is I want to preface this whole  concept of picking the perfect city. And then I want to talk about like the, the, the, the,  the, there's like, to me, I wrote down rules, right? That I have for picking the perfect city.  And so basically I'm going to give you my rules for picking the perfect city.  And they're kind of basically like tips and things that I live by their principles that I live by  when picking the perfect city. So that's going to be the format of this, but this is, I want you  guys to know, this is from somebody that has, I've actually analyzed personally over a thousand  niche and city combinations. Okay. Personally, that's not including my VA's that I trained to  do. However many else I have done this so many times, it's ridiculous. I've looked at so many  cities. I know some of the weirdest cities. In fact, I'll meet people sometimes and they'll be  like, yeah, I'm from Virginia. And then I'll be like, oh, which part? They're like, well,  you don't know. And I'm like, you'd be surprised. And they'll tell me to sit them like, oh yeah,  I know where that's at. And they're like, how do you, I'm like, because I've looked at maps,  like I'm a geography teacher. So I've done this a lot guys. And that's why I know like what I'm  talking about. And I don't want you to trust that. I know what I'm talking about. I want you to put  this into practice and basically like test what I'm talking about. Okay. So a little bit of preface.  Hands down, this is the most important step in the process. And I genuinely mean that if you look at  my material inside of digital landlords, when I built it, I didn't even realize this. But as I  started like recording, like my material of the process I was doing, I'm like, oh my gosh, my  section on niche selection and picking the perfect city, the due diligence process is the biggest  section in our training, which would blew my mind because I never even realized. I thought it was  like maybe the closing or whatever. This right here guys is the most important step in the process,  because if you do this correctly, it makes everything else easier. If you do it incorrectly,  everything else is going to be harder. Okay. So there's a reason why today I'm not starting  off with talking about niches. I'm not starting off with talking about niche ideas, which we may  get into in",

    "pageContent": "the future because it's always a fun topic to generate ideas, tell you guys about new  niches. And the reason why, and again, these are just some preface points I want to come up with  and want to remind you of is that I am a huge believer, okay, that you should be going into  boring niches, AKA tried and true niches until you have retired yourself. Okay. And by the way,  when I say retired yourself, that means you have enough money coming in from this model  that your bills are paid for and you no longer have to work a job and everything else is gravy.  Okay. So whatever your number is, if you're a college student and, you know, you live on  ketchup and potato chips, you have a car that's paid for and you live in your mom's basement,  which I, no judgment, you're in a great position. You might only need one deal and then you're  covered and everything else you can go take a chance, you can take a risk on. Until you hit  that point, I'm a huge believer, stick to the tried and true, stick to the boring, because it  eliminates half the equation. You got to get the niche right, you got to get the city right,  you got to get the combination right. So if we can eliminate one of it, which is the niche,  we already know concrete is good. We already know artificial grass is good. We already know that  spray foam is good. We already know that masonry is good. We already know that fencing is good.  We already know that tree service works. We've just eliminated 50% of the equation.  Now we could focus on this part, which is getting extremely good at the city. Okay. So as a reminder,  like if something works, like what you're going to find out is you're going to be okay,  I'm going to follow Nick's advice, and then you're going to get to like 5,000 a month.  Okay. And you're going to realize like, why the heck would I go chase some crazy niche when I  know this works and I can just do it again and again and again and again. And that's what I did  is I was like, I'm going to get to this like certain point. And then I'm going to start  looking at that. Like, you know, the riches are in the niches. I'm going to find that crazy one  no one's ever talked about. And then I got to like 15, 20, 30 and like, dude, I'm just going  to keep going. Like, I don't, I don't care what niche it's in. Just, I care about the money.  Right. So just as a reminder, that's why I'm talking about the city. I'm not necessarily  talking about niche and city. I'm talking about just city because I'm assuming you guys are not  stupid. And I'm assuming you guys are going to listen to what I'm saying and realize, oh,  that makes sense. Let me eliminate half the equation. And I only have to solve half of it.  Focus on the city, go into the boring niches. I'm not saying you have to do concrete, talk a lot  about concrete, but do a boring niche, focus on getting good at picking a city, go get yourself  out of the rat race, retire yourself, quit your job. And now you could start  messing around with new niches. Okay. So, um, a couple more things really quick. I bought a  program back in 2016, my very first program that taught me how to do this stuff. And, um, that  program had an antiquated process for",

    "pageContent": "picking a city and niche. It had an antiquated process. And  it to fair in fairness to the person that created this program, I believe that their process at one  point did work. I believe it was really good, probably like three years before. But by the time  I got into it, by the time I was serious about it and I was actually following the advice, it was  antiquated. Okay. Um, a couple of things that were wrong with it. Number one, and you guys might have  heard this in other programs. Some of you guys, I guess a lot of you guys probably bought other  programs and I want you to listen to what I'm saying. You probably will relate. I kept hearing  the same thing over and over. The riches are in the niches, the riches are in the niches,  the riches are in the niches. And I just believed it. I was like, yeah, that makes sense. Right? Like  if I can go into something that no one's ever thought of, I can completely dominate that niche  and I'll just be the only one. And it's completely wide open, blue ocean, whatever. And so guys,  I spent six months doing basically a website in every single niche. You can think of all the  ones that you probably shouldn't go into and all the ones you guys have thought of the plumber,  the HVAC, the electrician, the carpet cleaner, the towing. I mean, all the ones that I hate,  I did because I, I just was told, you know, the riches are in the niches and you need to test all  this different stuff. And I was thinking, I spent hours analyzing niches and looking at home advisors,  different, you know, niche categories and looking at billboards and looking at flyers in the mail  and like so much time. And then I would build, let me try this. Guys, I had this bag of websites  with no money coming in. Okay. That was number one. And so I ended up with basically a website  in every possible niche you could think of with very little money. Okay. And the money that I did  have coming in was in the tried and true niches. Go figure. Right. Okay. And the crazy part is guys,  is I continued on this for like three years from 2016 until the end of 2019. I continued just not  listening to the, like the advice I'm giving you right now and just following that training,  which was like, keep building in niches and you're one day going to find it. And three years in,  I was making eight to $10,000 a month. I was, by the way, making less than I was doing door to door  sales, working more hours. And by this point, I had stacked up 60,000. If you guys don't know  my story, then I, at this point I'm $60,000 in debt. Okay. And like, I just felt completely  hopeless. And luckily I realized this still was the perfect model, but there were just some,  some problems with the training that I was in. And I needed, one of them was I need to figure out  how to pick up the right city and the right niche combination. Okay. And so anyway, long story short,  guys, is that what I realized is that, and this is something you guys need to remember.  If you go into a boring niche, and I'm going to say boring as in tried and true, concrete,  tree service, spray foam, all the stuff we thought of, everyone else has probably thought of it too.  Right. Which means you need to find an obscure or a weird city. Okay. And so what do you think",

    "pageContent": "about,  what do you think everyone else is looking at? When they pull up a map, they're looking at all  the cities that you could see. You know, when you pull up a map, you could see Raleigh, North  Carolina, Salt Lake City, Utah, Las Vegas, Nevada, and then you zoom in a little bit more,  maybe it's going to show the next layer. Right. If it's a city you know of,  probably everyone else knows of it. Okay. So just remember if it's a boring niche,  you're going to need an obscure city, a city that no one, that the average person wouldn't  think to look at unless they'd been trained to look like I'm going to train you today. Okay.  And on the flip side is if you guys can do the opposite, which is if at some point you find that  weird niche, then you have the ability to go into more boring or big cities because no one really  is in that niche. Okay. But it's much easier in my opinion, because everyone's trying to focus  on the weird niche and the big city to go into the boring niche and the obscure city, because no one  wants to go into the obscure cities. No one wants to go into Bentonville, Arkansas. Nobody wants to  go into Queen Creek, Arizona. Nobody wants to go into these places because it's not what you hear  of it. It takes effort. It takes knowing what to look for. Okay. So basically guys, I started  testing this. I realized that like, okay, why don't I just focus on the boring niches? Why don't I  focus on the stuff that I know works? Right. And then I'll focus on the cities. And I started  doing this, and I picked one niche at the beginning of 2020. And I said, I'm going to  focus on one niche. That was Tree Service. And I had a bunch of other sites that were ranking  generating leads. I'm like, and I'll try to sell these at the same time. Guys, I focused on Tree  Service. And that is the year that we did seven figures. We went from eight to $10,000 a month in  December of 2019. In July, we did $100,000 a month. It's bananas. Looking back on it, I didn't even  realize the wave I was riding, but it was just working. And I didn't have time to step back and  look at like, oh my gosh, we're growing. I didn't even know we did $100,000 that month until the  month got over. And I started looking at the Stripe accounts. I was like, oh my gosh, we did it.  We did $100,000. And it just continued from there. So this is exactly one of the primary pieces of  the puzzle before I was able to scale is dialing in this process. And unfortunately for me,  nobody could teach it to me because I didn't know anyone that was actually making big money  in this business. They were all making big money selling coaching programs.  But fortunately for you guys, I've done it. I figured it out and I'm going to share it with you.  And so basically what happened from there, guys, to wrap this up,  for those of you that don't know me, seven figures in 2020, just barely over a million. We just  barely passed it. 2021, I did $1.45 million. And then by the end of 2021, my inbox was inundated  with people asking me how the hell I was selling so many deals and had the same training as them.  And I was doing everything completely different because you guys know I do",

    "pageContent": "pre-selling.  And I kind of shifted the model on its head and figured this out. And so in 2021, at the very end,  it was like December 1st, we launched Digital Landlords. So that's the story. And that's why  maybe you ought to listen to me. And you also don't have to. So guys, let's talk about  these rules that I have. These are principles that I have. And I would highly encourage you guys to  take notes if you can. Take notes of what I'm about to say because these are principles that  I like legitimately, if I'm doing a city, it has to check these boxes. So I'm just going to  go through these. And then any questions you guys have, I'm going to let you guys ask them.  Okay, so here's these are my principles for picking a good city. Obviously, guys,  like I told you at the beginning, this isn't I want you guys to remember, this isn't like  enough information to just go build a seven figure agency, because I can't cover that in 40 minutes  or, you know, whatever. But this is enough to get you started. To get the wheels turning to get you  guys like thinking in the right direction and putting your focus in the right direction. Okay.  So here's the rules that I live by here, the principles I live by when picking the perfect  city. Again, coming from doing this over 1000 times again coming from making millions of dollars,  not selling my program digital landlords, not doing consulting, but doing exactly what you guys  are doing, which is building simple websites, ranking them on Google, renting them out. In my  case, I like to rent them out, then build them, and then make the money completely backwards,  but you get the concept. Okay. So guys, let's go through this. Number one, guys, and these aren't  in no particular order, but they all matter. Number one, number one rule, number one principle  for picking the perfect city is that population does not matter. Okay, now I know that it in  many courses, by the way, if you are in a course, I promise you I've been in it, I have it. I know  who they are, probably a friend of mine. Maybe not, but population doesn't matter. It's crazy.  The first training I got told me that I should look at population. I can't remember like 100,000  to 250 or 500. It was based on population. Okay. Population does not matter. Here's why.  Let me tell you what does matter. Search volume, the demand, search volume relative,  that's what you guys should remember, search volume relative to competition is what matters.  Okay. Let me repeat that. Population does not matter. Search volume relative to competition  does matter. Okay. And I always give this example. If I were to offer you a website and I said,  I'm going to gift you one of my websites, I'm going to give, I have so many ranking websites  and you've got two options. Okay. Number one option, and this is by the way, it's going to  be an artificial grass. I'm going to give you, you can either get a website that's ranked in,  you know, Manhattan, New York, one of the most populous cities ever, I think. In fact,  maybe I better check. I think it's super populated. Maybe I better check before I give you guys.  Hold on. Okay. 1.6 million people. Yeah, that's good. That's a good example. You can have a  website, you can have an artificial grass website in Manhattan, or you could",

    "pageContent": "have an artificial  grass website in Queen Creek, Arizona. Both are ranked, both have a GMB. Which one do you choose?  Okay. Now, this kind of extreme example, and I'm using Manhattan because kind of a concrete jungle,  but the point is that if you're going off population, you'd say all day long Manhattan,  right? But anyone that's like lives in Manhattan or knows Manhattan, it's basically like,  it's like apartments, right? It's completely concrete. I know that there's probably some  outskirts and then whatever, whatever, whatever. But you'd know the point that I'm making. Queen  Creek, Arizona, I think it's like 30,000 population. Let me check. It's growing,  which is another one I'm going to talk about. Queen Creek, Arizona population is 59,000. It's  literally like less than a tenth and like less than a twentieth of Manhattan. And I'd probably  take Queen Creek, right? Because Queen Creek, Arizona is an area that checks all the other boxes.  Got a bunch of people looking for turf because of the climate and because it's growing and because  of just a number of different things. So I want you guys to, and I've looked at the numbers and  I would take Queen Creek, which sounds bananas. It sounds crazy, but that's true. So just remember  as my first principle and what you guys should adopt as well. I guess you don't have to, I hate  to say you should, but you should consider is that population doesn't matter. Okay. Again,  this is from experience. This is not because I read it in a book. Number two, I kind of already  alluded to this, but if you can see it on a map, it's probably not going to be worth your time.  Okay. If you pull up in a map, USA, Australia, whatever, I don't, it doesn't matter guys. This  works in, throughout the world, right? Depending on the city you're in, depending on the, how  people search, how people do business. Not every country is great with this yet, but depending  where you pull up in a map, if you can see the city with that opening view or one or two clicks,  one or two zooms, and I probably would go further and say, if you know about the city,  it's probably not where you want to go because most likely it's what everyone knows. If it's  the Salt Lake City, Utah, if it's the Los Angeles, California, if it's the, if it's the Las Vegas,  Nevada, if it's the Denver, Colorado, if it's the Albuquerque, New Mexico, if you're going to be in  the boring niches, like I suggest you're going to want to go into more obscure cities. Okay. So  it's just a quick rule of thumb. If I know about it, if it's like I could see it on a map,  I'm probably not going to go into it. Okay. That's, and again, that is assuming that you're  in a boring niche. And just a quick reminder that if you're in a boring niche, you're going to need  an obscure weird city. And if you're an obscure niche, you can usually find those bigger cities  because no one's in them. But if you can find both a boring niche, like a tree service and a big city  that's got no competition, you have found literal gold. But I would also recommend that you don't  go chasing it because you, it's not worth your time. You usually stumble upon these things. Okay.  Just so you know. Okay. So that's number one. Number one is population doesn't",

This is applicable to U S and I would guarantee  this is probably applicable to every country and certain cities, but certain states in the U S  suck for ranking. Okay. Certain states suck. And the number one state, if you guys follow my content,  you probably know it's California. I, if you call me and you're one of my family members and you  want leads, that may change my mind for that specific like specific situation. And I would  still probably like think about it. Okay. Other than that, you're not catching me in California.  I've tried it. I've done it. I've been there and I can't even put my finger on what it is.  I just would recommend, I would just recommend you stay out. And maybe some of you guys are thinking  I'm trying to get you to stay out. So I'm going to go and you guys can check with any of my team. I  have zero websites in California. Zero. Well, I did, but for whatever the case is, it seems like  people are, when you, when you cold call, it's, you know, you try to get someone on the hook,  people are leery because someone's always trying to scam them. The leads just seem to be a little  bit kind of weird. You got people that want to overly check the licensing. It's just a weird  state. And again, I can't tell you why I'm just telling you from experience. I'm not going into  California. It's one of my rules. If it's in California, I'm out. Okay. Certain states suck.  Another state that I find very difficult for whatever reason, only from experience is New  Jersey. I don't know why. I don't know what it is, but those two states have been extremely  difficult. I will not go into California. I won't look at New Jersey, but if I get a referral in  New Jersey, I might look at it. But I know it's not something I'm going to go look at. I also  think it's weird because it's set up weird. There's not, it's kind of like just spread out.  Those two states to me are, are terrible. Okay. Prove me wrong. And I'm sure that you can make  money in California. But the thing I look at is like, yeah, I can, but why? Who am I proving?  What am I proving it to who? Right. So, um, certain states suck, namely California. Okay.  That's number three. Number four, weather and seasonality do actually matter guys.  Weather and seasonality do matter. So one of the things that I do, one of my principles is I look  at the states and cities with, with, by the way, real quick, as I'm going through these principles,  if you have follow-up questions to these principles, please start dropping them in  the comments so that we can start getting, um, those questions, um, so that I can just get  through them at the end. So we don't have like a lag. If you have any questions regarding any of  these like principles, I'm giving you these rules, these laws that I follow, just drop them in the  comments. Okay. Weather and seasonality do matter. This is number four. Okay. I always first am when  I'm looking at a, at a specific niche, I'm going to look at the cities that have, and sometimes  it's not the, or sorry, the states that have the most moderate",

Even with the most moderate weather, I'm  still like the, the state trumps I'm out. Like I, the fact that I don't like to say that trumps the  fact that it's got good weather. Does that make sense? Um, nonetheless, uh, I always look at  states that have like moderate weather. So Florida, Florida, like it, you know, it's got pretty decent  weather year round. Um, Arizona, pretty decent weather year round. Nevada, decent, moderate  weather year round, right? Even parts of Utah. And I know this cause I have a house in St. George,  Utah, which is very close to Vegas, very moderate weather, right? And it, it does get hot. I guess  I might want to even tweak what I'm saying. Seasonality matters, but also like when it, like  try to stay away from places that just dump snow is maybe a less elegant way of saying it, right?  A less elegant way of saying it. Um, but like St. George, Utah, for example, it never snows. And so  people are always pouring concrete. Tree service is happening year round. Does it slow down a bit?  Yeah, but it doesn't stop. Okay. So it does actually matter. So Florida, Arizona, Nevada,  et cetera. Now you guys can, I want to tell you guys this cause let's say you were listening to  this right now and you're like, Oh my gosh, I have this website in this state, in this city,  and I probably made a mistake because you can still get deals. It's okay. I've done it.  What you have to do though, is if you go into North Dakota, heaven forbid you do concrete in  North Dakota, you're going to have to realize in the winter, it's going to stop. And so you're  going to have to sell that deal and you're going to have to set expectations up front that, Hey,  just so you know, like the winter is going to shut off, but you're going to keep paying me  because I'm not going to charge you as much during the hot months. Like you have to,  again, this is something that we cover inside of our training with our scripts, but it's,  you have to position it correctly. Okay. You have to position it very, very well. It is doable. I  would just highly recommend you try to stay away from like extremely cold States. Okay. And the  reason I say that is because like it's, it's just, it's tough. It's tough guys. I'm trying to make  this as easy as possible myself. Okay. Okay. Number five. And this, this isn't, this one kind  of goes hand in hand with, this is more of like a reminder. This kind of goes hand in hand with the  first one, but it's just a kind of a rule to remember is bigger population usually means  more competition. Bigger population usually means more competition, not always, but most often  bigger competition. There's a reason why Dallas is almost always impossible to rank a website.  And so there's a reason why Dallas is going to be one of the hardest places to get your website to  number one, because it's Dallas, it's Fort Worth, it's Arlington, it's this big DFW area. And there's  so many people there that businesses are like, Oh, if I could just be in this area, there's  unlimited customers. And you're thinking that and they're thinking that and everybody's thinking  that. So just remember as the rule, the bigger the population, usually not a hundred percent",

So what I try to do is I try to find the,  the cities with the least population that still have adequate search for the least population.  And I've found some really small cities. I have a specific project in a city of 30,000 people.  And this thing, it doesn't make me a ton of money. It makes me like, I think like six or seven  hundred bucks a month, but guys, I don't even think I put a backlink on it. I think we just  threw up a website. We rank number one, throw up a GMB, boom, done. And that thing just been  churning out 600 bucks a month for two, three years. Okay. Has enough search volume to get me  that six, seven hundred bucks a month, but it took almost no work. Literally I just built a website  and it's up there. It's done. We're good. Okay. So the bigger the population, usually the more  competition next. Okay. Another rule that I live by another law principle I live by is do not  run away. Do not let me say, do not immediately run away when you see another lead gen site.  Do not run away when you immediately see another lead gen site. Guys, in the beginning of my  rank and rank career, I, as soon as I saw another lead gen site and you guys know what they look  like, they had the quote form and they look kind of bad, kind of terrible. We have like, we're not  designers. We're, we like money, right? We had terrible looking websites. That's why I always  make fun of my websites on my, on my shorts and my posts and stuff. You know, when you see a lead  gen site typically, right? It's a generic name, blah, blah, blah. I used to be somebody as soon  as I saw a lead gen site, I was out. I was like, no, I'm not going to mess with it. And I was like,  gosh dang it, I should have got here earlier. And sometimes I'd even like go down and I look at the  who is I'm like, and I'd find that person in there in my group. And I was like, gosh dude, I hate.  And I occasionally, I even tried to reach out and buy those, these websites, these people just  never worked out. And I like, just turned me away. And then I had an experience and I was in my own  backyard. I was in St. George, Utah. And I was looking at tree service, right? It was when I was  scaling tree service in 2020. Sorry. Yeah. 2020. And I did the research and everything looked good.  Wasn't super competitive, but I saw another lead gen site. Okay. So I clear as day, another lead  gen site. And I was just this close to just like being like, I'm not going to do it. And then I was  like, you know what, maybe I'll just reach out. And I found out who it was. Sure enough, they were in  one of my other groups, following the same training and whatever. And I was pissed. And I was like,  you know what, I'm just going to reach out because I know who it is. I found them on Facebook. I'm  like, Hey, are you interested in selling your tree service site in St. George? Just so you know,  I live here. And they couldn't have been more rude. Not only were they not interested in selling  me the site, but they were not interested in even having a conversation. They were not",

It really, really pissed me off that they like treated  me like that, that I did it in spite of that. I literally did it in spite. I was like, okay,  game on, game on. They were like number two. I was like, I'm going to be number one. And out of spite  for this person, I went ahead and went into the city and built a website,  got a client and had one of my best clients. I signed this person in 2020 March. I still remember  it was like mid-March, right in the middle of COVID on the hood of their truck in a gas station  parking lot. I swear to you, this is a true story. We had talked on Zoom earlier and then she had to  talk to her husband or vice versa. No, I met him at a coffee shop. She talked to me. I swear to  you, we met at a gas station and we signed a physical contract for the first month in March  2020. It was one of my best clients ever. And they stayed with me for a long time. They eventually  went on to do their own stuff like a few months ago, but they kind of outgrew what I was doing.  They wanted to just expand. But literally, I would have missed out on, I think I made, what was that,  over $20,000 because I almost ran away. Okay. So what you guys have to remember  is just because you see another lead gen site, don't assume that that website's getting leads.  Number one. Okay. What I mean by that is like, just because you see another lead gen site,  doesn't necessarily mean you should go into that city. It doesn't mean they are getting leads. So  it doesn't mean that like, yeah, that's a guaranteed, you should go to that city. Number  two, don't assume because you see a lead gen site that they have a client. In fact, most of the  time I would be like, pretty much assume they don't have a client. And that was the case in  St. George tree service. I actually called the website or I requested for a quote and nobody  answered. And then I did it like two or three times, nobody got back to me. And that's why I  was like, let me reach out to these people. Don't assume they have a client. Okay. What you guys,  and some of you guys might be in other programs, look at our free Facebook group. We have 6,000  members. Do you know that in over half of the people in that group, in our free Facebook group  have already learned the skillset of building a website and getting leads. They're probably in  one or most of them are probably in, most of you guys are probably in one to two other groups.  And the problem is, is just because you could build a website, just because you can get leads,  does that mean you're going to make money? Guys don't assume because someone has a ranking website  that they are working with a client. Okay. And thirdly, do not assume that two people  cannot have two different clients in the same city. Even if they do have a client,  why can't you work with Bob and I work with Joe?  You can, it doesn't matter. It's just another website. We get so scared. We think that,  who cares? What I do is if I see another lead generator, I just take that website and I view  it just like any other website. I pretend it's Bob, the freaking concrete",

That's it. And if it still works, if the numbers, if the competition is still low  and the search volume is still there and everything else checks, dude, I'm going into it.  I could care less or I couldn't care less. I think I couldn't care less how you say it.  Okay. Don't immediately run away when you see another lead generator site.  Okay. I got one more. Try to, this is my last one and I actually have a bonus one really quick.  Try to find areas that are growing rapidly statistically. Try to find areas that are  growing rapidly statistically or that are statistically growing rapidly. I don't know  how the best way to say that English is. Okay. And I'm telling you this because if you know of  areas that are growing rapidly, whether it's because of data you've seen, family members  that live in those areas, you've traveled there for other jobs or vacation, knowing this information  about cities will allow you to look at cities and confidently go into cities you never would have  confidently gone into before. Even when everything else doesn't look so perfect.  Okay. Let me give you two examples. Number one example is Bentonville, Arkansas.  I lived in Bentonville, Arkansas, selling door to door home security systems. I saw how many houses  were being built. I saw the construction companies. I saw how many families were moving into  Bentonville, Arkansas. And I knew that the reason they were moving into Bentonville, Arkansas  is because Walmart was headquartered there. And Walmart had a policy that if you want to sell to  Walmart, you needed to have a office in Bentonville, Arkansas. Who knows about where? Bentonville,  Arkansas, you need to have an office there. They're that big. They can demand an office.  And so I was like, okay, Walmart's not going anywhere. And the guy that works for Jack  links lives over there. And the guy that works for Pepsi lives over there. And the guy that  does this. And I was like, this place is just going to keep growing. And I statistically  was looking at some of the data with how it grew. And I was asking people, what was the recession  like? They're like, dude, we didn't even feel it. And I saw just new construction after new  construction. And I knew, because I spent time there, this place was going to explode and continue  to grow. And it's continued to explode. Okay. And when I did the research on this area,  the numbers weren't perfect. They weren't so good that I was just thrilled. I might have even  skipped it. First of all, I wouldn't have even looked at it. Second of all, I probably would have  skipped it if I hadn't have lived there or known about it. And, but because I knew about it, guys,  I went in and build a website. You guys know, I've talked about some of that Bentonville  concrete.com. And that site has made me so much money. It was so easy to rank. It was like the  most perfect golden website ever. But one of the biggest reasons, because I had information,  this was actually like first-hand information, that this city was rapidly growing. Okay. Another  example of St. George, Utah, ironically, where I live, I, it's the same type of thing that the  city is just exploding. The population when I built St. George tree service was not that great.  And I was like,",

    "pageContent": "no, man. In fact, I avoided my own city for a long time, because I was like,  everybody's cheap and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I don't want to sell the people that I know.  And I was like, you're being an idiot, Nick. And in 2020, I built like three, four websites  that made me over a thousand dollars a month each in my own backyard. And at one point,  I think we were doing like close to $10,000 a month in my own backyard from niches in my own  backyard, but that I'd completely skipped. But I finally was like, dude, look at all the growth,  look at all the houses, look at all the construction companies, look at wherever all that.  And it just was like, duh, you're such an idiot, Nick. Okay. Try to find areas that are rapidly  growing. Okay. And if you can get statistics, great. If you know first-hand information from  family members, friends traveling there, or you've been there yourself, even better. Okay.  My bonus tip, my bonus rule. Okay. And this is something that like doesn't have to be checked,  but it's, it helps a lot. That's why I want to give it to you guys is knowing the demographic  and the area. Okay. Which kind of goes hand in hand a little bit with what I just said,  but if you guys can know a little bit about the people that live there, right? A little bit about  the people. I'm a, I'm a big believer that humans are humans are humans. Meaning that like, if I,  you know, like, for example, humans, what's a good example? Like for, like if I'm somebody in Utah  that likes groceries delivered to my house, it's pretty likely that you living in Connecticut,  you also like groceries delivered to your house because you don't want to go to the grocery store  and waste your time and potentially get, you know, sick or whatever the case is, right?  Humans are humans are humans. However, I have learned that from state to state, city to city,  definitely country to country, there are nuances. And the more you know, the better decisions you're  going to make. And let me give you an example. In bed in Northwest Arkansas, there's a city called  Bentonville. I just talked about an hour and a half, maybe two hours south. There's a city called  Fort Smith. Okay. Just, I think about two hours. I've been there a few times. And I will tell you  that the, the difference in the people is so, is so different. It is, they're still from Arkansas.  They're still a Southern ish. I'd call them more Midwestern, but technically we say Arkansas  Southern. But guys, for some reason, people that live in Fort Smith have this old school mentality.  It's good old boy. We only do business with people that we know. And when we want to do business,  we ask for referrals and that's it. And we don't want anyone new in our town. And if you come into  my town, I'm not that interested in talking to you. That's how the mentality is. It's two hours away  from Bentonville. And guess what? In Bentonville, no one's from Bentonville. No one, everyone's from  somewhere else. And they're, they've been implanted because of work. Another example,  St. George, Utah, where I live. Okay. Tons of people moving in, but in my cul-de-sac,  where I have a house, my next door neighbors from Northern Utah. So they're from same",

    "pageContent": "state,  but like four hours away. Then the other two people in my cul-de-sac, one from Texas,  one from California. Okay. Like everyone's from not there. Like, and I'm not from that city either.  I'm from Utah, but I'm not from that city. Everyone's moved there for work opportunities,  for the weather, for recreation, whatever. And because I knew that I'm like, okay, confidently,  I know that if people are from California or people are from Texas, you know, they're probably  going to be more likely to spend money. One thing I know about people from Utah, because I've lived  there, is that in small towns in Utah, people are very cheap. People would say, do anything to save  $5. I swear to you, they would drive across town, not thinking they're going to spend $15 in gas  to go to get a $5 coupon redeemed. And I swear to you, I'm not making that up. If any of you guys  on the stream that are from Utah, you guys can verify what I'm saying. So I knew that the city  that I lived in, St. George, wasn't really Utah people. It was mainly like people from out of state.  45 minutes up the road, there's a little city called Cedar City, Utah, which I went to college  in for two years. And that place is basically only people from Cedar City. And guess what?  No one wants to spend money. You want to charge what to pour my concrete? Nah, dude, I'll just go  get the bags at whatever and get people from my church to come help me. You want to pay for moving?  I'm not paying for moving services. I'm certainly not going to have you pressure wash my driveway.  I'll just go buy a pressure washer. I'll do it myself. Like, this is the mentality of these  people that are 45 minutes away from the city of St. George in a city called Cedar City.  It's insane. And so the hard part is, if you don't live in those areas, you don't know that.  But when you know that, it changes the entire game. So you have to remember, the more information you  can get on these cities, the more information you can get when you call business owners. Because when  you're calling business owners, Nick notes, how did that one act? Oh, that one acted like he didn't  even want to talk to me, like I had a disease. And then the next three were the same. Okay,  maybe there's something there. Right. So guys, just remember that knowing the area and the  demographic people does matter. Okay. So let me give this quick recap on these different laws  of picking the perfect city. And then I'm going to go into Q&A. So number one is population does  not matter. Number two is if you could see it on a map, then it's probably not going to be worth  your time. Number three, certain states suck, namely California and New Jersey. Number four,  weather and seasonality do matter. Stay out of places that are extremely cold if you can.  Number five, bigger population usually equals bigger competition. Number six, don't immediately  run away when you see another Legion site. Number seven, try to find areas that are growing  rapidly. And then my bonus tip is the more you know about the area, the more you know about the  demographics, the better decisions you're going to make. Guys, these are things that I have learned  because I have literally looked at a thousand locations. I've gone into  hundreds of the wrong cities, hundreds. And I mean that like we had well over 200 websites at one ",

So you guys have to realize that like all these  people that are giving you advice, build, build, build, build, build, build, build, build, build,  most these guys are selling you tools to build. Most of you guys, most of those guys are making  money because you are building more websites, right? I'm not selling you tracking numbers.  I'm not selling you websites. I'm not selling you hosting. I'm not selling you that stuff.  I don't. And that's not how I roll. I want to build a website that's going to work. I want to go.  I want to run ads. I want to get the deal. And I want to be a sniper. I don't want to take a  shotgun and just shoot bullets. That's messy, right? It's just some heavy cleanup. I want to  be a sniper. And if I decide to go into that city, it's one shot, one kill. I know what's  going to happen. I'm most likely going to get that deal. I know I'm going to get that deal.  I'm going to build a website and I'm going to have a really clean business. I'm not just throwing  stuff at the wall, hoping to see what sticks. Okay. So that said, guys, who has questions?  Let me see if there's anything in the comments. We got some stuff in the chat.  Here we go. So just for the sake of time, I'm going to go ahead and just read through these  in the future. I'll try to leave more time. We can have you guys come on live. So  Jay says he's in Jersey. Jay, prove me wrong, but I promise you Jersey. I don't know what it is,  man. It's a weird state. Okay. Kirk says, I'm not sure what you mean by relative to competition.  Can you give an example? So what I mean by that is like,  so let me read your entire comment to make sure I know exactly. I'm not sure what you mean by  relative to competition. Can you give an example? E.g. volume 50, then what would too much competition  look like for that volume and location? So that, again, as I said in the beginning,  we're not going to be able to cover all of that in this 40 minutes. That's part of what we talk  about, our formula for picking a perfect city in terms of competition. We're just talking about  about like my rules of picking the perfect city. But what I mean by that is like, you want to get  into a city. What matters is having enough search volume while still having low competition. And  what I mean by low competition, guys, is the ability to rank your website. Right? If you look  at Las Vegas, Nevada, tree service, there's probably going to be a ton of search volume,  but it's also going to be a lot of competition. Okay. If you look at Las Vegas, Nevada,  tree service is going to be a lot of search volume. There's going to be a lot of competition.  Right. We want to go into cities that have good search volume. They're probably not going to be  as high as Vegas, but there's almost no competition. That's the sweet spot. Right.  That's what I call a layup. Hopefully that makes sense. And again, to answer that specific question,  the like the volume and all that stuff, that's something that we that's like, it's a much  heavier question that we cover in more",

    "pageContent": "depth in inside of our thing. But Mark,  what's your take on a town of 40,000 with search volumes of 10? So the tricky part of the search  volume thing, we're going back to like also what Kirk said, is it depends on the tool you're using.  Right. Because I don't know what tool you're using and you what, basically I'll give you like the  overview with, with tools, they're all wrong. Like nothing's accurate period, just so you know,  like nothing's accurate. All you're doing with tools is you're finding benchmarks. You're finding  out like how, okay. You know, Bentonville, Arkansas, concrete, I'm ranking number one  for all these keywords and I get 30 leads per month for the last two years. Okay. Boom. So  how much, what does that tool say about Bentonville concrete? Well, it says that there's only  50, sorry, it says there's 15 searches. Well, that's not true because I'm getting 30 leads.  Right. So then I can safely assume that if the tool says 15, it's probably double. Right. So you  kind of have to find a benchmark and go off that. So I can't answer that question based on that data,  but what I would tell you is like 40,000 is on the lower end and 10, no matter what tool you're  using seems low. The other thing you have to consider, which I probably would add, I would  definitely add into this, but I don't, I don't want to get too much into weeds because that's stuff  that I cover when you have to have the full picture is you need to know what the CPC is  because if it's, if it's a search volume of 10 and there's zero cost per click,  then that probably means no one even wants that traffic.  And I don't know if that makes any sense to you, but I can go into that in more depth, but yeah,  that's going to be too hard to answer. I would say just my gut tells me that's not enough  volume. You got to have adequate search volume. Guy Prantz, same thing. You guys are asking really  good questions. This is one of those things like, again, that it's tough to answer unless  you know exactly the entire process. So adequate search volume basically means taking a website  that you know for a fact is ranking really well, looking at the numbers of that in terms of how  many calls it's getting, comparing that with the tool you're using and using that as a benchmark.  And you have to do that repeatedly. You have to do that because the tools change, the search volume  changes, and you kind of constantly have to be doing that. And so, and at the end of the day,  it's not entirely a science. It's more of an art. And by doing this a thousand times,  you kind of recognize these patterns. Okay. Laura says definitely done that.  Kirk, how do I benchmark a niche location when I don't have a site there? You guys can use,  if you want to ask this question, Kirk, inside of the free group, you can ask this question.  Like you go make a post, and then Aaron, I'll have you remind me to look at the data on,  we could say Bentonville concrete, and I can kind of give you a city that's ranking really well,  and you could use that to benchmark if you guys want. Okay. Howard says, does median income  matter? If so, what's the average income threshold you're aiming for? I think it's a factor. To be  honest, I've never really looked at",

And so I've,  in fact, I've only done one website in, I think, was it, no, that's in Louisiana.  Maybe I haven't done anything in Mississippi. I just kind of stay out of states that are like,  it sounds bad, but like, I don't have to go into Mississippi. I can be that way. I don't have to  go in there. I can, whatever. So it does matter. I've never really like looked at it too much. I  think it's more about just like, I don't think you need to worry that much about it, but as a  state, if it has like kind of a stigma as being a poor state, I probably would avoid it. Okay.  Jay says, so should I just start in Bentonville? You can. You definitely can. And guys,  funny thing is I'm so not the person that gives a flying you know what about like,  guys, I'm telling you guys which cities I'm in. I'm not hiding anything. I'm telling you the  niches. I know I'm telling you the web. Like I have videos on, on YouTube. You guys could see  website examples. And the reason I do that is because if I'm taking care of my client,  I shouldn't have to worry, right? It's like being married to someone and being worried that like,  if you introduce them to your handsome friend, she's going to leave you. That's the wrong person to  be married to, or you're not, you're not bringing, you're not pulling your weight. So I don't worry  about that stuff. So I'm, yeah. So basically, Jay, if you want to go to Bentonville, dude, check it  out. It's a great city. St. George, Utah is a great city. Queen Creek, Arizona. I'll share that  with you. These are great cities. They're growing. You can also do a Google search and type in like  fastest growing cities for the last five years in the U.S. and get the same thing. So, you know,  but keep in mind if it's Bentonville, I probably looked at it as well.  Jason, you're 100% New Jersey is highly competitive and saturated. Very difficult.  Interesting. Beautiful. Guys, thank you for being on. I appreciate you guys being on. I love this.  I don't know even how many we ended up having on, but let me see. We got Paul,  Mark, Ferranc, Lara. What I want to do, Aaron, can you hear me still? Hop on really quick before  you guys hop off. So what we're going to do guys is Aaron's going to, he's been on this call. He's  going to create just like a simple, like PDF with these rules, like a really like nice looking clean  PDF. And anyone that was on this live, I'm trying to think how we could, what you're going to do,  Aaron, can you like screenshot everyone that was on this live somehow? And I want you to  send this to them. So if you guys were on this, just because I appreciate you guys staying on  to the end, if you're on here right now, then Aaron will DM you from the Donnie Dre. We tried  to do that so Aaron doesn't have to be inundated with messages on his private one. He's going to  email you like a nice looking like document with all the stuff I went over today. So if you guys  were on there, stay on. Did you screenshot it yet,",

I don't look at that metric and I never have, so I couldn't. I  look at the search volume versus the CPC versus the competition. And again, the competition thing  is kind of one of those formulas that we teach, that I teach inside of my program, but I could  cover it in more detail. Again, I want to give you guys as much as possible. It's kind of like  the free leads thing. Like I want to give you guys, I want you guys to be able to take what you  learned today and be able to get started, right? Just like we don't want to give our business  owners leads and, well, here's some leads, but I hope you don't make money, right? That's stupid.  I want you guys to take this. If you guys make money from what I teach you today,  you'll be back next time. So amazing questions, guys. Appreciate you guys being on and we'll be  doing these every single week. So keep an eye on the Facebook group and we've got some other stuff  coming up this week as well. So thanks guys. I'm out.",

    "pageContent": " Irving, we have a site that ranks very well organically, about 80 gross leads a month,  but about 75% of leads are spam calls, web forums, still 20 qualified leads. A business  owner is not digging it, misses some calls, and when he does pick up, it's spam calls.  Any suggestions for a situation like this? I told him to pick up every call, follow up every call,  because the call he misses out might be a juicy one that he'll miss out on.  I don't know what you're using. I know with some of these tools, you can blacklist some of these,  but I'm going to be honest, I've had this happen a lot, and I think not a lot, but it had to happen  a few times. I think when you're buying tracking numbers, you just got to realize that sometimes  you get a shitty one, and sometimes it's a number that's been spammed out, and so there have been a  couple instances where we've just had to change the phone number, and it sucks because you have  to go and update it on your GMB and the whole thing, but what I would do first is try and do  the blacklisting thing and see if you can figure that out, and then if you absolutely have to,  I think it's worth it long term to just let the business owner say, hey, we're going to have a  little bit of a decrease in calls, but we're getting a new phone number to get rid of this issue,  and now every call that comes in should be a good one. Now you've got to go update your citations  and all that good stuff, but nonetheless, I think that it's worth it at some point.",

    "pageContent": " Beautiful. So guys, welcome to the call. Welcome to the art of digital real estate. I don't  know how many lives we've actually done. But one thing I want to point or I want to just  let you guys know is I mentioned this a few weeks, even months ago. I think I just mentioned  casually in a post, but the this group is going to be changing. I'm not going to give  too many details, but it's as you see it now is not how it's going to be for long.  Not trying to scare anyone, not trying to do any of that, but it is going to change.  One thing that we've learned again and again and again, and you guys need to remember this  as well, that is when people don't pay for things, they don't value it. I've been given  access to a program that it costs. I was just talking to Aaron about this. I was given access  to a program that cost $30,000 just to join. And it's a couple thousand dollars a month.  And I have full access, right? Like top tier access. And I have literally watched like  10 to 15 minutes of content and I have access to content that's worth $30,000. But because  I didn't pay for it. And by the way, the reason I got access is I was trying to check. I was  I wasn't looking at the content itself necessarily. I was looking at how it was structured. But  needless to say, even at that level of content that's that valuable, they're able to charge  that kind of money. I'm not even like taking advantage because I didn't pay for it. So  that said, guys, we are in the process of making some massive changes. And so if you  guys pop on to this group in the very near future, but a.k.a. before the first of the  year and it's very different or it's not here or whatever, that's that's why. But in  the process of doing that, I went through and I looked at how many lives we've done.  And Francesca, how many how many hours of content do you think we have in this group  that people some people take a lot of advantage of? But how many hours would you think that  we have in here?  I'll tell you an estimate. Let's go like this. Let's see.  I don't even know if we can calculate the amount, but like literally we've got, yeah,  like thousands and thousands of hours, like ridiculous amount of content. So anyway,  that's it. Just you guys have an idea on that. But anyway, Francesca, welcome to the call.  Good to have you on. Thank you.  We are going to be doing a quick little announcement. It's it's going to not take  a ton of time, but I do want to make sure that we got as many people as possible.  So I appreciate the 15 of you guys that are on. We're going to keep this post live  for other people to see it. But what we would like to do as we transition for two reasons,  as we transition away from the current group as it is, and as I sat here and reflected on  the fact that we've been doing this for over three years, like three years and some months.  What we decided to do and we did this, we've only done this one other time,  and this will be the only other time that we do it because the group's going to be changing.  But we are going to be doing a scholarship like we did, you know, it's like two, three,  four months ago. I don't even remember when that was. Was that three months ago,",

    "pageContent": "two months ago?  September, I think. September, we did something similar.  This is going to be slightly different. But what we're doing, we're going to be doing this.  It's like we're calling it the thousand days of renting shitty websites. It's the celebration  of a thousand days of running shitty websites inside of this group. We've been doing this over  three years. This group and I've been going live every single week up until recently when I realized  that there weren't people taking full advantage. But anyway, in celebration in kind of as we  transition this entire group, it's been freaking awesome. I've loved every second of it and it's  still going to continue. It's just not going to look the same and it's not going to be  free 99 anymore. We're going to be doing a scholarship. OK, so what this entails is if  you would like to, we're going to post a link and we have a couple of questions. You click on the  link and basically you're going to tell us why you think you deserve the scholarship. What the  scholarship is, is it's going to be full access to digital landlords. It's a hundred percent free.  Like we're going to. So to be very clear on this, we're going to be giving away one  full scholarship where we are going to be giving somebody inside of this group that applies  completely full access to digital landlords, to the community, to the trainings, to the curriculum,  to the support, to the scripts, to all, to everything, even the premium stuff like our  premium sales library. They're going to get access to everything, access to me.  We're going to be doing that in this group. So Francesca just barely dropped the link.  You click on it. I don't know. There's like a few questions, like 10 questions. A lot of them,  though, are like name, whatever phone number, whatever. Just click on it, fill it out. Francesca,  I think I can pin it. Let me pin it really quick. OK, I just pinned it. If you guys would like to  apply for that, go ahead and click the link, apply for it, give us full answers. We try to make it  as short as possible, but also we really want to give it to somebody that's deserving. Our last  winner is that we've only done this one other time. Our last winner was somebody that we felt  was very deserving, that really had their heart in the right place, that just couldn't do it.  Why am I carrying myself? Can you hear me? Yeah, it was me because I commented it doubled played.  Oh, OK, I was like, why? No, you're good. You're good. So anyway, guys, if you would like to apply  for that, go ahead and click it. Now, what we did last time and we'd like to do again is there's  only going to be one winner of the full scholarship on the actual application for this scholarship  there. I think there's a question that says if you're not selected for the full scholarship,  would you be interested in entering into a partial scholarship? Last time we gave away a handful of  partial scholarships to allow for a few additional people into the program. Now, it's still they still  had to pay. It wasn't completely free, but we did do some partial scholarships. So when you're  filling this out, if you are interested, if you don't win the main one, if you're interested in  potentially a partial, which we're probably going to give a handful, two, three of those away,  then click that box. But if you click that box and we do select you as a",

We don't  want to waste our time and we don't want you to say, yes, I'm interested in possibly in a partial  scholarship. And then, you know, we give it to you and not somebody else and all that. So  that's all. Anything else I'm missing? No, I think you covered you covered it.  Yeah, it's simple. Click on the link apply. It's it's going to take you guys like two,  three minutes. And again, we're doing this. This would be our last one that we do. It's our second  and last one that we do. And we're doing it in celebration of 1000 days of renting shitty websites,  which, of course, you guys know, it's it's it's funny. Okay, don't don't don't laugh or don't make  don't don't get mad at me calling it shitty websites, because a lot of my websites are shitty.  Most of my websites are shitty. And also, partly because we're transitioning into a completely new  model than a free Facebook group where people could just sit here and not consume the thousands  of hours of content that you guys haven't taken advantage of. So go ahead and apply at that link.  And let's do this. So let's see, what else do we have? Do you want to go over the questions from  the post from yesterday? Let's do it. Let's start with that. We're going to start with going over  the questions from the post from yesterday. I'm going to drop the link to Zoom for anyone that  wants to hop on. Guys, this is a chance that you have to jump on, ask me a question directly. If  you are, first of all, Francesca will tell you I'm the most chill guy ever. Yeah, you should  there's an I don't buy whatever. I do get a little bit excited sometimes. That's the only thing I can  get a little bit excited. That's true. Right. That's a good thing, though, I think. Yeah,  no, it's good. It's good energy. But I can get a little I can get a little bit snappy, but not at  anyone that's not working directly with me. So Francesca has to deal with that. Not you guys.  OK, I'm going to drop the link and then Francesca, let's pull up the questions. Let's start going  through it. And I think we should also give some stuff away. I agree. I agree. I just barely,  which for the record, I have been I mean, it's it's I mean, I guess I hate to say sounds bad,  but I guess I started the company and I realized the other day I was talking to Kyle on the call  and Kyle had on that like super comfy black hoodie with the with the red badge.  And I was like, dude, I don't even have that hoodie. So guess what I did? I had to text Ashley  and I was like, yo, can I get a code so I can get the hoodie? Francesca, do you have the hoodie?  I was going to say I don't have the hoodie. I'll sell it. I'll sell it to you.  I'm just kidding. Francesca, I'm going to let you be the first winner. Text Ashley  and go ahead and get yourself the hoodie. It Kyle swears. I haven't even touched it.  We have different sizes. Of course we have different sizes. It's you just you just order  your size. It comes right directly to your house. No shipping, nothing free. Boom. I",

We got  the air pod cases. We got the I have Rubik's cubes, but I don't that might be a little bit  difficult. I might even have one here. Let me see. You brought it to your hotel room?  Yeah, they're sick. You know, I brought it for a gift. I'm meeting a friend  that is super interested in this model. So check these things out, guys. I don't want  to open this yet, but can you see this? We got the Rubik's Cube. I gave away these away on Halloween  and I thought they were going to be like because I ordered so many or like five,  six hundred of these. I think I ordered 650. I thought they were going to be like really  crappy quality, sticky, sticky, whatever. Dude, these things slack, man. These things.  I'm tempted to freaking think I should open it just to show you guys. I have to.  Can you do one? My son can. My son was teaching me how.  Anyway, pull up the question while I show you guys how smooth this is.  Yeah. So like, look at this one hand. I mean, these these are I don't I don't want to mess it  up because it's so pretty. But I mean, dude, these these are pretty, pretty smooth. I was  pretty pleased with the quality of these little cubes. So let's see. Let's see what we got.  We got the T-shirts. We got the sweaters. We got the Rubik's Cube. We got the mugs.  We got the mouse pads. Yeah, I think we're going to be doing the beanies as well.  So let's give away some stuff. Let's answer some questions, do some live coaching.  You guys apply for the scholarship. Today is a great day to be in digital real estate and let's  get into it. So Francesca, what do we got? Let's answer some questions here.  We have Donnie asking if you're starting a fitness program.  Shut up, Donnie. And then we have.  OK, Donnie, Donnie, Donnie Dre, watch your mouth. I'm kidding. No, I'm not starting a  fitness program, but yeah, we have anything to say. Go ahead.  No worries. I don't know if I'm saying the name right. So I apologize. Aleda.  OK, what's the question? Do you think the Google Ads for local services  would impact negatively your system? Isn't that what we do?  Yeah, I'm trying to read this over and think. Is that so? Let me let me pull up the questions  too, because maybe I'll read it a little bit differently just because a different set of eyes.  For sure. Pull it up. Is it on the?  It's in the post where you're in the ocean. And by the way, guys, I do want to apologize  really quick that for yesterday, I'll take that. I was on me. I was running late.  I decided last second to come down to Vegas and I was already going to be a little bit late.  So I was going to have Francesca set up the live and it literally wouldn't.  I know it probably sounds like it was an excuse. It would not load.  We could not get we couldn't stream it and we wanted to be able to record it.  And we just wouldn't load. Aaron tried it. Francesca tried it. ",

I'm looking real quick.  All comments. Let's go through these. And I also dropped a link. Looks like we've got somebody in  the OK, let's let's answer this question first. Then we'll get into the questions on the post.  This is Ravella from Newark, Delaware. Hold on.  OK, can you hear us? Rev, I'm going to call you Rev.  OK, you got to unmute. Hold on.  OK, there you go. Can you hear us? Hi. Hey.  How are you? I'm so good. Do you say it Ravella? Do you say it Ravella?  How do you pronounce it correctly? It's Ravella.  OK, amazing. So what's your question? Let's let's get into it.  I am so sorry. I just wanted to say hi. Oh, amazing. That's even better. Hi.  Glad to have you in the group. Let's do this really quick. How long have you been in the group?  I've been a participant in about six months. My boyfriend, he's very involved in your group  and he loves you and Nick. So amazing. Or Porter. Yeah, amazing. Well, who doesn't like Porter?  I'm a little bit harder to do more of an acquired taste, but I appreciate it. Tell him.  Can I ask you a question? Yes, that's why we're here.  Maybe this has come up before, but like, is there where did you start?  Like, what groups did you start in when you first got started? I mean,  so when I originally started, this was back in 2016. I listened to a podcast and I heard about  this idea that you can rent these little websites and I just like hooked me. I think I've told this  story a hundred times, but it hooked me and I really wanted to do this. So I started doing  exactly what I hope everyone does that's on this call, which is I tried like, you know,  on the podcast, he was, he was given some examples. This person was like,  you're going to buy, you know, build a site, blah, blah, blah. I didn't know anything about anything  and started doing it. And as I started getting into it, I'm like, oh my gosh,  there's a million questions. So that's when I was like, okay, there's got to be a quicker way.  Let me see if there is. And that person that did that podcast, they had a program and then there  was next. Every single program out there that's on the subject of rank and rent, I have been,  I'm in or have purchased like with the exception of probably the most recent ones that have cropped  up in the last two years, but yeah, you name it. I've got it. I've been in them all. And a lot of  them have really, most of them have really good things. I just always felt like there was a  missing piece and the missing, the missing piece for me was the fact that you had to wait to rank  the website. That was the part that I couldn't wrap my head around. I'm like, how can I scale  if I have to wait for this website to rank? So, but I have nothing bad to say about any of these.  The only time I don't really appreciate it is when people, you know, they don't even know how to do  it themselves. They haven't made any",

Or the gym trainer that's overweight, like whatever. So anyway, yeah, I'm in all of them.  And I give credit to all of them as well, because I've learned stuff from all the people out there  that you can think of. I would recommend them all for different things, but I think the missing  piece for me in my mind, and I think the only way to do this is by renting first and then ranking  later. Thank you so much. You're a true inspiration to us. Yeah, you're awesome. Thanks, Rev. And when  we make this transition to something different inside this free group, keep an eye out, okay?  Okay, thank you.  Okay, let's start going through some of the questions. And thanks to Rev for jumping on.  If anyone else wants to jump on, see, you can even keep your camera off and it's not a big  deal. Okay, can't bite through the camera. All right, why did the, where did they go? Where did  they go? Where did they go? All right, Francesca, it looks like I'm gonna have to read these.  Um, do you want me to read them? No, I got them. I think just because that one. Okay, so we've got,  uh, yeah, yeah. I think I know what she's talking about, but I'll let you read it again.  All right, I'm just looking through, you know, what's funny as I'm looking through is I, and  that's something I want to point out. I'm going to get to the questions too. I see Donnie Dre,  you're going to start a fitness program as well. I need some games, dude, freaking, freaking Donnie  Dre. I love it. Okay. So a lot of people just commenting in 2025 to keep it posted. I apologize  people saying, is the event happening? I'm so sorry. Okay, I see it. Aleta, she says, my question  is the following. Do you think the Google ads for local services would impact negatively your system?  She's talking about the, I think she's talking about the new Google guarantee ads to turn them  on. You need to have, you need to provide more, more stuff than we usually normally would like  your business license, stuff like that. Yep. And they do, they are at the very top. So she's saying,  do you think, you know, the, yeah, so, so here's my opinion on it. This is just my opinion. One,  one humble man's opinion. Uh, I believe that if you can run them, then you should. And if you  have to get a whole bunch of extra information, then it's, I don't think it's worth the time.  It's kind of how I feel about WordPress, right? And I'm, I know I'm not, I haven't completely  answered the question, so I'm not, I'm not done yet, but I'm just going to give you an example.  People always ask, do you need to use WordPress? Do you need to learn WordPress? No. If you know it,  then is it better than Weebly? Yeah, I think so. It's got more, it's got a lot more capability.  You can do it for cheaper, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But for you to go and learn WordPress,  the time it's going to take you, the, the attention, the time, et cetera, ",

    "pageContent": "you're way better off spending that time focusing on getting better at getting money,  at getting people to give you money, at getting better at sales, at getting better at due  diligence. It's not worth learning the skill, but if you already have it, you can. So I think my  opinion is the same on this and anything else that crops up is like, should you go and make,  you know, can I still, basically it's like, can, can you still be successful even if you can't run  Google guarantee ads? And the answer is, of course you can, of course you can.  Will it help if you happen to have the business license and the business owners consent and  whatever else you need to run them? Of course, do it, run it. It's great. Just like if you can  get a GMB, of course it's going to help, but it's not going to, it's not a deal breaker.  And that's just my opinion. But again, I just have my opinion on everything is I always, I'm,  I'm a, I'm like, I feel like I'm a problem solver. And those things don't scare me.  I remember when I first got into the game back in 2016, people, they were running,  you guys know they were running Google guarantee ads in some of these big cities back in 2016.  And everyone has spooked to death. Oh my gosh, Google is going to take over lead generation.  Is lead generation still going to be around? Blah, blah, blah. The sky's falling. It's in 2016.  And I think I was just too dumb to even worry about it. I was like, well, if that happens,  I'm going to make a little bit of money until it changes. And I just kept going and going and  going. And here we are millions of dollars later. And yeah, they're still running Google guarantee  ads and we're still making money doing lead generation. That's my opinion.  What do you think Francesca? Did you have any other questions on that?  Yeah, no, I agree. And also like to think that Google would completely remove any type of other  ads when we're like their primary customer, that would mean they're not making any money.  And I think everyone is money oriented. So if Google is making money with us,  they're not going to get rid of something that's producing cash.  I think, I think if they could run, if they could run their own,  they could do lead generation that could replace Google ads. And yeah, I think they would do it all  day long. It's capitalism. But I think you're right. I think that, I mean, they're, they make  money a lot of ways. They have a lot of products. They have a lot of different services, but the way  that they're, from what I understand, don't take this as, you know, don't, you could fact check me  and tell me I'm wrong, but I've heard one of their largest, largest revenue streams is Google ads.  And it makes sense, right? How many thousands I've personally spent one and a half million  dollars plus, you know what I mean? So, okay. Ismail Hunaid from Pakistan.  2025. I am very confused in selecting a niche. Could you give me three niche ideas that can give  me 2K USD? Secondly, kindly guide me niches in UAE, please. 2K USD. I'm guessing he's talking  about per month. But this is, go ahead. No, I think so too. I'm not going to give,  here's what I'm going to",

    "pageContent": "do. I'm going to do something that's going to help you more  in the long run. You may not like it in the short run. I'm not going to give you the niches,  but I'm going to give you this advice. And I'm going to tell you that all you need to do,  Mr. Hunaid, is you need to just reverse engineer. You need to look at, okay, if I can charge,  for me to charge $2,000 a month, the business owner has to be netting at a minimum. They need  to be making probably three, right? They need to be making at least three because they're not going  to, or four. They need to be doubling their money safely. Let's say four. And that's in their  pocket. So then you have to start going, okay, well, what niches are they going to be able to  charge enough money and close just a handful of deals where they can make that kind of money?  And so then you could start reverse engineering. You can start looking, but basically the answer  is you need to go into the bigger ticket stuff. Okay. And then there's a fine line where you don't  want to go too high of ticket because if you go too high of ticket, like for roofing or solar,  which has huge ticket stuff or remodeling or some of these other freaking competitive niches,  then you attract the big dogs. Then you attract the national companies that are spending budgets  that are insane. Then you're attracting companies that have marketing companies within them  just to do their own marketing. Okay. So that's my opinion on that.  And then on the UAE, that one I am not going to speak on because I am in the process of testing  some stuff right now. And we've been, Francesca, we've looked at a couple of niches. We've done  some deep dives on some niches in the UAE. We're going to be releasing some of our findings,  whether it's on, inside of digital landlords, potentially on YouTube. I'm not really sure,  but we're going to keep that in the back pocket just in case. Okay.  So that is what I would say on that. Okay. So Chris says, that's my thoughts. Will AI destroy  lead gen with Google search changing it in some way in the future? Well, you don't know for sure.  You take the money on the table while it's there until it isn't. I have the same opinion on AI.  Rather than being scared of it, I'm stoked. The reason why is because as long as you're a  problem solver, then all I think of AI is it's going to help me, right? It's something that I  can use. And guess what? If it shakes up the entire game, then fortunes are going to be lost,  but fortunes are going to be made. And as long as I'm somebody that's willing to put my head down,  get to my desk, turn off the distractions and learn and stay ahead of the game,  and I'm not somebody who wants to just remove myself from this game, then I'm going to be good.  In fact, it's going to be exciting. In fact, there's going to be tons of opportunities. So  that's where my thoughts on anything new that comes. It's like, you should be excited. It's  an opportunity, right? Whenever there's blood on the ground, whatever that quote is, there's  great opportunities as well, okay? So great point, Chris. And Rev says yes as well. Okay,  so what I think I'm going to do actually is I'm going to go into, Francesca, if you see any other  questions pop up,",

Sorry, it's not a question, but Kevin, I know you mentioned you're  disappointed in the announcement, but I do want to say like, we're building something that's going  to be better than this. So be excited. Wait, who said that? I'm pretty sure. Kevin in the comments.  Where's Kevin at? Underneath the live. I'm not mad. I just, I'm curious. I just want to see  which Kevin. Kevin Koparski.  Oh, I only recently discovered this model and group. So I'm slightly, oh yeah, he's,  okay, that makes sense. Yeah, he's disappointed because of how it's changing. So Kevin, yeah,  basically what we're going to be doing is take advantage while you can. We're not, nothing's  going away today. That doesn't mean it couldn't go away tomorrow, but I want you to know that like,  I promise you when you pay for something, you value it more. There have been people that have  really, that have really taken advantage of this group, but the amount of people is just a handful,  right? Like I think once, once the, the access to this group is no longer, I think people are  really going to see how much value we really provided because it's going to be insane. What  the heck is calling me? Wild. So yeah, don't be, don't be bummed about it at all. Just keep your  eyes open. And in fact, Kevin, send me a message, send me a private message and I'll give you some  recommendations and help you out. Like our goal here is to add value. And it's just, it's a shame  that people don't take advantage of things that are free, but it's just human nature. And I was  just telling you guys, like this, like I said, Francesca, it's like, even me, I've got access  to this like incredible information that is probably worth, you know, probably more than  $50,000. And I'm not even taking advantage because it didn't hurt. I didn't cost me anything. And so  I don't have any skin in the game. And so therefore, it's just how it works. And so anyway,  it's, it's going to be a good change. You should be excited. You're right. And it's going to allow  us to give even more. It's going to, it's going to be, we have 6.2 thousand members of this group  right now. There's probably, every time I pop on, there's like 500 people that are active, like  always, every time I jump on, I see like 500 people that are active. So it's, it's pretty good  for a Facebook group, but there's probably half or 4,000 people that join this and they're no  longer interested or they're not serious or they're not doing anything with information. And so my  goal is to take the 6,000, 6.2 thousand and find the 500 that are interested, the 500 that are  always online. And I want to freaking give you guys immense value to get you closer to your first  deal to get you further in the process. And obviously then eventually when you guys are ready,  you can join us inside of digital landlords. So that's the goal. And so anyway, I don't want  to give too much away because we're still kind of working through it, but just so you guys know,  take advantage while you can. I'm super stoked that we have a bunch of people on this call.  And if you guys have questions, please let me know. I just saw that I",

No, you cannot, sir. But I would love to give you  a phone call and I owe you a phone call. So I am in Vegas. I'm actually doing some filming this  weekend, locking myself in a hotel room, doing some filming, but I am around next weekend. So  if you're still on this call, sir, give me a text. And also I would love to gift Mr. Corey McNeil  with some swag. If he takes me up on it, I'm going to say swag winner message at fix it,  fix it Felix. Actually, I'm going to say message Ashley. Sorry. Okay. For the code and Corey,  your pick on what you want, sir. Appreciate you. Corey is one of the smartest dudes I know,  by the way, on a lot of topics, but especially on SEO. Corey says he's in Salt Lake City. Okay.  Amazing, bro. Text me. Okay. Anything else that you saw? That was something that you saw you wanted  to mention real quick, right? Anything else, Francesca? No, I'm looking. I don't see anything  else. What I'm going to do is this. I'm going to do two things. I'm going to go through,  I'm going to try and clean up any of the posts that we've had in the last maybe week  by answering those questions. Obviously seeing if anyone wants to come on live and ask me a  question. Guys, you have an opportunity right now. If you want to come on live,  if you want to just say that's completely fair. You know what I learned though? This is a little  trick I want to teach you guys is if you want to get somebody's ear, if you want to get somebody's  attention, go and find out what they're paying for, go and find out what's important to them  and go and buy it or show interest in it and you can get their attention. Let me give you an example.  I have been trying to get a hold of this guy. I think he's so captivating. I want to hire him  to do some stuff. This is a guy online. He's got about a million followers. Dude, you can imagine  how many DMs. These have come recently. He's blown up recently. You can imagine how many freaking  DMs this guy gets. I was an idiot at first. I DMed him like, dude, I want to hire you. How much would  you charge me to do this, this and this? Whatever. Nothing. Crickets. I hit him like six times and I  was like, dude, what the heck? How can I get this guy's attention? I started thinking, I'm like,  all right, what does he do? I started going down his thing. I found out this guy had a,  he had like an info product, right? And part of the info product is you are part of this group  that you can like, whatever, you're part of this community with him. So I just went and bought his  thing. It's a, it's a monthly thing. It's like $50 a month. And as soon as I bought it,  I sent him a DM, like within the first two hours and got a response like that. And I said, hey,  I sent you a message on Instagram. I want to hire you for something. Can you check it?  And he responded within 30 minutes. So anyway, just a little hack. And the reason",

Okay. And by the way, I'm not act, I'm not trying to seem like I get hit up like 17 times a  day or whatever. I'm not trying to act cool or whatever. I'm just saying that, you know, anyone  gets hit up, but it's very annoying that people expect you to give, give you their time. You know,  like I used to be that guy that was like, Hey bro, you know, Hey sir, I would love to pick your brain  and take you to lunch. And what you don't realize like nobody even at certain levels, people don't  even go to lunch like that. They just have the lunch delivered to them. They don't go and like  chop it up for lunch. Okay. So, and the people that did say yes to me, I'm so grateful for them  because I know how annoying it is. So anyway, that's just a little side note. So I'm going to  go through again. I'm looking at all these, I'm apologizing again and again for all these people  that were looking for the link yesterday and we couldn't do it. I'm so sorry. So let's see,  uh, let's answer this question. Ching Chia Wang said the following. Okay. I have a roofing,  I'm going to go through this one. By the way, guys, if you want to hop on, hit the link,  come talk to me. If not, we're going to keep going. I have a roofing client who paid me USD  $3,200 per month in March and April this year, then dropped off due to his father's illness,  then came back and paid me about the same from June to August, then dropped off in mid August  due to him wanting him being too busy. Now he messaged me on Friday asking if I have a spot  for him. I do not want to take him on again because he does pay, but I don't like the fact  that he treats my service as something that he can just opt in and opt out of at will. Okay.  So I, this is a huge message or a huge post. I actually didn't see the whole thing, but basically  I think he's just asking for advice. Have you seen this post? No. Okay. So basically he's asking  what, what he should do. I think if I'm misreading that, but it's like three times longer than that.  I thought it was short. That's why I opened it up. What would I do in this situation?  Well, first and foremost, I don't hate money. I do like me some money and I there's, it's hard  for me to say like, even if somebody, I don't know at that amount of money, it's tough,  but what I would recommend is that you just need to at this point, put this person in a contract,  right? Like even if it's lower and I don't know, it says paid me USD. Like, I don't know if that's  a flat fee deal. If that's a flat fee deal, then the solution is really easy. Be like, yeah,  I'll work with you, but you got to give me a minimum commitment. Otherwise I'm working  with somebody else. Like that's, that's it. And if he says no, then you just don't work with him.  Yeah, exactly. I have a contract in place that way he can",

And I would always  have a contract in place no matter what, even if they're, you know, someone that you trust and  they've never quit just because you never know. Yeah. Especially winter time. You never know when  stuff's going to happen. All of ours, all of our clients, we try our best to make sure that no  contracts come out during winter. And if they're approaching, if it's approaching winter and they're  month to month, or they're like almost out, Francesca and I are like, we got to get this  person back in a contract. Like, what do we got to do? Like, we got to make sure they're very,  very happy. Go ahead, go ahead. Yeah, sorry. I know in this case, like he doesn't even have  the excuse of saying, well, I need to test it out. Like he has tried it. He came to you. He wants  more. So you really have all the power in your hands at that point. Yep. 100%. And also guys,  at some point, like you just have to have some, you just have to draw a line in the sand  and nothing is more empowering than when you don't need the money.  And even if you need the money, but you make it seem like you don't need the money,  you'd be amazed how much more people want to work with you. When you're willing to walk away,  I'll give you a quick example. I've got somebody that, I've got somebody right now that's,  that's a friend of mine and he is joined. He's, he wants to join our program. He wants to join  he wants to join digital landlords. He's again, I've known this guy for a long time and  he's asked me about five different times about joining. He, I mean, he knows everything. He  knows what the commitment is. He knows how long the learning curve is, how much it costs to get  in all this different stuff. And I think it frustrates him to no end that I will never,  I do not try at all to sell him. In fact, if anything, I try to push him. What the first  time that he called, he said, he said, so you're going to, I want you to sell me on your program.  And I was like, I'm not going to sell you on my program. I don't, I don't say, I said,  I don't really even like working with people. I know that much because a lot of pressure for me,  which is actually true. Francesca knows this. And I said, I think you should actually, I said,  you know what you should do? I said, go into the free group and go and try to do this yourself.  And I said, the reason why I know I don't want to be rude and I'd love to earn your business, but  I want you to go and see what it's like to do it on your own without my help so that you appreciate  me when you come back. And my point with saying this is that because, yes, I want his money.  Of course, I'm not allergic to money. And, you know, of course a part of me wants to be like,  dude, let's wrap this thing up. Like, why don't you do this? But it's so, it feels so good when  you know that that person wants to work with you, but you, you don't need the money.  And so you get to retain your pride and you get to say, you get to almost push the deal away.  And the more you push it away, the harder it comes at you.",

    "pageContent": "It's this funny thing about life.  It's about, it's like the moment you stop caring is the moment it comes.  So get to a point mentally. And it's hard in the beginning because every dollar, I remember  my first deal, my towing deal, I did everything wrong. Like I, the only thing I did right was a  flat fee, but I let them do a, a paper check, which gave them all control. And Francesca,  we're dealing with this with one of our clients right now. It's so annoying, right?  Yeah. Oh yeah. And when you, and if this set up expectations as well, at the very beginning,  when you act like you matter and you know, you're putting those boundaries, it goes along ways  long-term too, I've noticed. Cause when you're loose at the beginning, then they just think they  can kind of do whatever they want in other aspects of the deal. They can hit you up on,  you know, a week and night or whatever it may be. But it does like, it does set up also a standard  for the rest of, you know, the deal that you're going to work with them for, not just the beginning.  A hundred percent, a hundred percent. So anyway, that's just a little thought. That's something  I've learned. That's about, it's like, and I've learned this in every area of life. It's like,  it's for those people that are out in the dating game, it's the same thing with that. Like the  second you stop caring, the people that are just chasing, chasing, chasing, they never get anything.  It's the people that have options or seem to have options that get more options. It's just weird how  it works. So be that way, be that way with business, be that way with your business owners,  have a no fear of loss mentality without trying to be too hype up type of a guy. Yeah, it's,  a lot of this is just mental stuff. So, okay, let's give away, I want to give away some swag  really quick and then let's get into some more. I'm going to keep going through the,  through the, what's it called? Questions? The posts?  The posts. Yeah. Okay. I do see a few though, real quick. So, let's do some, let's do some swag.  Corey McNeil. Okay. He DMed me. I'll send him my number. Okay. Corey, great. But Corey,  you need to get some swag, bro. Especially if you're in Salt Lake, you need to, you need to  get something to represent the digital landlords badge. Okay. Fino says, knowing what you know now,  if you just found out about this business model three days ago, what's the first move you're going  to make? Oh, we just did a live on this two days ago. How to make your first 750. You know what  I'm going to do? I'm going to recommend Francesca while I'm going through these questions. Can you  go over to Spotify, go to the podcast episode, episode, how to make your first $750 of, in  digital real estate, $750 a month in passive income with digital real estate, whatever it's called,  and, and reply with that link for Fino. Yes. Okay. So, I have a podcast episode on this exact topic.  You can also do it on YouTube, but I think, well, if you want to do it on YouTube, you can find it  there, but Francesca, get him the Spotify, the podcast episode that we did. I think it's podcast  episode",

Perfect.  From Olympia, Washington. Okay. Sean Ryan. Hey, I'm in the paid group and I've been struggling  to find a solid city for concrete and tree service. Is there a better way than just manually  grinding through the city's list of cities off like a state database? Okay. Sean, great question.  You know what I want you to do first? Or before you forget it, I want you to go and I want you  to post this inside of digital landlords, because I would love to answer this question and have  other people weigh in as well. Number one thing that I'm going to recommend to you  is in this, like you have no idea how much time to save me. If you're not already, you've got to go  and use rank and rent engine. That is going to save you so much freaking time. I have done so  many due diligence in my life, guys. I could have freaking learned how to do this a long time ago  or in a million other things. By the way, solving a Rubik's cube, it makes you feel like a genius,  just so you know. I did it once. My son showed me step by step. Imagine my 11-year-old son.  And when I finished it, I felt so smart. So just a little hack for those of you that don't feel  that smart all the time. Yeah. Yeah. That's all I have to say. Okay. Francesca.  Yeah. I'm posting that. Oh, you're making me hear myself. Oh, God. Okay. Is it gone?  Yeah, it's gone. Sorry. There's no way for me to really prevent it.  It's all good. Okay. I'm going to give a little bit of swag away. But anyway, so  Sean, post it in the free, post it in the paid group, use rank and rent engine. But other than  that, like go into the training, by the way. And it sounds like I'm not giving you the answer,  but like I would rather teach people how to find their own answers than just give it to them.  Because if I teach you how to find your own answers, number one is you're going to get  better at that skill set. But number two is you're going to remember it better. So like,  I think you've probably noticed on this stream, I've tried my best to like, not just  spoon feed you the answers. And Sean, I want to make you a 25,000 per month type of person.  It's a really good question. And I will answer it in detail for you inside of digital landlords.  But I would recommend that if you would just use the rank and rent engine tool,  it will save you so much time because you can just pop the city. And the only thing you need  to do is find the competitors, which you can do really quickly. And it's going to find the back  links, age of the domain, it's going to give you all the information on your competitors,  all of their information. The only thing that it's not doing in the detail that I would like  it to do right this second, but that Ryan has told me he's working on is giving an in-depth  backlink profile, which that is what the developers, to my knowledge, are working on  as we speak to have a backlink feature that shows you an in-depth look at the backlinks  of the competitors. So right now, when you go into",

It does tell you how many backlinks, but it doesn't give you the information  in the detail that I would like it to make the decisions. Sometimes when you find these areas  that they're a little bit more competitive, or you're wondering if they're too competitive  and you want to look at the backlink profile, that's what I think is lacking. But that's the  only thing that's lacking right now, and it's being worked on. But in terms of finding freaking  areas, that right there is going to save you a ton of time, because I have done so many freaking  due diligence by hand. And I've done them where I wrote them down on paper. I've done them where  I had the Google Sheet and I would copy and make a new one. I've done it every kind of way you can  think about. Use that tool. Okay. Other than that, I'm going to answer that question more  depth. I want to get other people's ideas too inside of digital landlords. Okay. But great  question. And a lot of it too is you just got to put in the reps. Like Francesca, you yourself,  you've probably done a couple hundred yourself, right?  Yes. And I was going to say, I know sometimes you feel like you get stuck sometimes with due  diligence, especially when you do a bunch and none of them are really like a good result.  But from my experience, then you'll hit like gold with one and he opens up a whole can of like  locations, maybe nearby or something like that. So you may feel stuck, but I do feel like he also  goes the other way around where you find a city or a state, something, some area, and then he  really opens up for you multiple. Really good point. Really good point. Okay. I just barely,  um, and Sean, I appreciate you being on the stream. I want to give Sean some swag. So I'm  going to, he's a winner. You're a winner of let's give Sean the t-shirt, Sean, a t-shirt swag winner,  your choice. We have a bunch of different, uh, t-shirts. In fact,  let's see, let's see, let's give away a little bit more. Sorry. I like giving away stuff.  Who thinks who wants some, let's ask this. Um, I want to ask, here's what I want to do. I want  to ask a question, by the way, anyone that comes on live and asks me a question, just because I  know people are like scared of it for some reason, I'm going to give you guys, uh, in addition to  answering your question, I'm going to give you swag. Okay. So, um, Ravella, you are a swag winner  because you were brave enough to come on and you didn't have to turn on your camera. Look at that.  Okay. Swag winner, t-shirt, message Ashley. All right. Based on, let's look at who has good  questions. If you have other questions, drop them in. But yeah, if you go just hop on and ask me  live, I will happily give you some swag and answer your question. Again, before, as we kind of, you  know, we got about 10, 15 minutes left here, but again, for those of you that maybe we're on  a little bit late, um, our announcement that we had at the beginning, we are going to be doing a  thousand days of renting shitty websites scholarship as we transition to a different  version",

And if you are  interested in winning the full scholarship, of course you are, that's why you're applying.  But also if you don't win the full and you have a chance at a partial scholarship indicate so,  so that we know who would qualify for that, uh, sub kind of side giveaway as well. Okay.  We're going to be doing a handful of partial scholarships and one full complete community  access, support, curriculum, coaching calls, a hundred percent, no catch, no nothing.  You're completely in, um, as well as a free month of, uh, or a discount on ranking engine.  Okay. So the link is in the comments and then we do have another question in there.  Okay. Miguel Williams says, have you ever tried the legal niche? I personally have not,  but you know what I'm going to do is I'm going to read something that I just got a message that I  have just gotten literally, uh, 12, 14 today. Okay. I'm going to read it. This is one of, uh,  my students inside digital landlords. I'm not going to use their name, but I'm going to,  I'm going to send this to, I'm going to read this out loud. Okay. Yo, this is,  I'm reading this entire thing. I'm about to close on a 30 K deal, 10 K upfront,  and then installments of five K. Um, it's not rank and rent and it's paper model,  paper lead model. The niche is personal injury lawyers. Just want to say your sales training  has helped me in general, even if the deals I close are not traditional rank and rent  or rent than rank. I'm going for deals that are 30 K per month as they seem to be the same amount  of work as two K per month deals. Uh, don't want to share it as a win until the card is charged.  And I don't want people to be asking how I did it, but I thought I would share here because I know  how you like to hear about your students closing patties. Okay. So I just shared it. Sorry, bro.  Um, I didn't, I'm not going to share the name. Um, but that's pretty dang cool. So I have not,  I, I like the logic. What he's using is like, why, you know, if you can make 30,000 a month  or $30,000 deal on a two K deal, it's not much difference in terms of work in terms of like  building a website. Yeah, it's the same, but there are, I do disagree a bit because there are levels  of work. And if you want to get into a blood bath, go into that niche. Okay. Go look at the cost per  click on a, uh, personal injury attorney in Las Vegas, Nevada. It's like 250 bucks a click,  something ridiculous. These are like a million dollar, multi-million dollar, uh, business deals.  Right. I personally do not like those because look guys, I'm in this business to do the least  amount of work possible for the most amount of money so I can go and live my life.  And that's it. And I think most people are in that same, that same frame of thought.  Like I shared this. Um, I think it was in here. Maybe it was inside digital landlords recently,  but I used to think everyone was like, want to make a million dollars a month and want to get",

People just want to  be able to do what they want to do. Like Francesca, if you didn't have to work tomorrow and money was  just coming in, what would you do? Like what would you do tomorrow? What would you spend your time  doing for the next week? Like an actual question. Yeah. I thought about that. I would go to culinary  school. Amazing to learn how to cook more better. Yeah. Like for myself. Amazing. Like,  and that would be freaking sick. Like how cool is it that Francesca, by the way, Francesca,  you need to start closing some of your own deals. But we're going to talk about that before I let  you do that. No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding. Francesca is awesome. Francesca runs everything for me.  She does all the work. She should get all the credit. Um, so I really don't want you doing that  because I need you. Is that, is that fair? Yeah. Okay. But no, I mean, how cool is it that Francesca,  if she wanted to, you know, could go and like, hey, I'm going to go to culinary school,  not because I need to make money, but because I would like to learn how to cook.  How cool would it be if you're just like, one day you're like, I want to move. Uh, I'm going  to move to Saudi Arabia because I want to go learn Arabic. I'm going to go there for a year.  I'd like not to make money just because I want to learn Arabic. And by the way, funny story, uh,  Francesca, I don't know if I told you this, I was in Dubai the last time I was in Dubai. I was  at this restaurant and this guy, I met this guy, he's this young kid and he offered, he's like,  dude, let me buy you a drink, whatever. I'm like, dude, you're 20. Like you're like your baby. You're  not going to buy me a drink. Like no, no, no, thanks. You know? Um, and so he's just having  this great time. And then he had a friend with him and I said, you know, I talked to, I said to  the friend, I said, Hey, nice to meet you. My name is Nick. And I said, this is your friend.  He's like, no, I'm his bodyguard. And I thought they were joking, of course, right? You can still  hear me, right Francesca? Yeah. Okay. It's a good story. And he's like, no, I'm his bodyguard. And  he didn't smile or he smiled, but I could tell he was serious. And I was like, I kind of got scared  a little bit. I'm like, what is this guy into drugs? Um, and anyway, I got the guy's Instagram  and the next day he messaged me and said, whatever, nice to meet you. And I said,  and I remember distinctly, he had shown me a picture of a Lamborghini,  yellow Lamborghini. And I was like, that's sick, dude. But I didn't really register to me. I'm  like, why then? Then I started thinking, I'm like, so how do you, I said, what do you do?  He's like, dude, I'm in college. I'm like, well, how do you have a Lamborghini? He's",

The, uh, what's, I looked it up. It's,  it's legit. Um, uh, well, there's a specific family name. It's the Saud, Saud, Saud, S-A-U-D.  So anyway, that, that was, that was fun. But, uh, that just made me think of that. Cause he's from,  he's from Saudi Arabia. He was in there for like a three day weekend and then he flew to Saudi  Arabia. Um, interesting people, the people you meet, right? And my point being is that,  and he was like, yeah, you should come visit Saudi Arabia. I'm like, I don't know if that's  dangerous, but it sounds really fun. Um, I'd love to come. Can I meet your dad?  I want to go hang out with his dad. Um, but anyway, uh, the point being guys is that you can,  you can do whatever you want. You, you, you go, you make your money and then you do what you  want to do. You go, you know, become a pastor. You go and, and do service trips. You go and,  you know, become a coach, uh, and not because you're going to make 600 bucks working for  four months. Like coaches don't get paid near enough, but like you could do whatever you want.  It's so exciting that you can do that. Um, and so my whole point with that, I'm going to circle  back around. I'm starting to get a little like Kanye and going off on the tangents, but to bring  this tie this back in is I want to go into niches. I want to go into deals that I can go in,  get a quick win, make a juicy profit, uh, and then go on to another one. And I have a low  maintenance guys. If you're dealing with personal injury attorneys, you are going to not only have  a lot of work, a lot of work. I don't think you even know, but you're also going to be dealing  with a clientele. That's not going to give you much slack. They are going to be very much on  your back to make sure that they are ranked and ranked highly, because you're going to be charging  if you're charging $30,000, guess what? What happens if that person wants to do a charge back  and they're an attorney, they're going to look at the contract and be like, yeah, we're going to  charge back. We know our rights, blah, blah, blah. I just don't think it's worth it. That's just a  whole long way of saying, I'm not, I'm not doing it, but I do know people that have had success.  Chris says, if I didn't have to work, I'd want to learn how to be the Morgan, how to be Morgan  Wallen. Morgan Wallen has taken the freaking age. Morgan Wallen has stolen every woman's heart and  woman and man's heart from the age of 14 to 40, because I'm in that category too. Shout out to  you, Morgan. Just quit getting drunk and throwing chairs. You like Morgan Wallen? Yeah. Good. You  should. Francesca has some of the most interesting tastes of music ever. You get in her car,  it's freaking a different language. Somebody rocking out, that's completely on acid. It's  amazing. Let's do this. I want to know, I'm going",

I want to ask this question for the group is, and by the way,  if you're listening to this after the fact, let's say you're watching this and it's Saturday or  you're watching it Sunday or you're watching this next week, you can still answer in the comments.  And if I like the answer, I'll still do this. I want to give some swag away based on these answers.  If you did not have to worry about money, let's say you had $20,000 a month coming in  which covers your bills and gives you some money to be able to travel if you wanted to.  Money was not an issue. You didn't have to worry about money tomorrow. You like whatever. It was  taken care of $20,000 in passive income from renting simple websites. What would you spend  your time doing? I want to know in the comments and I'm going to be based on my favorite answers.  I'm going to be giving away some swag. Francesca, I love your answer. That's why I'm giving you  the hoodie. You earned your hoodie. Perfect. But you have to post in it. You have to post a picture  in it just so everyone sees it. Is that fair? Okay. Easy. Deal. Okay. What would you guys?  Sorry. Go ahead. No, you go ahead. We have Chris asking favorite ways to close a baddie.  A baddie or a fatty. I see a B unless I'm going wild. When you say a baddie, I need you to...  I think he means a deal. If we're talking about baddie, like we're talking about like some like  some like nasty chick baddie. Like that's what I think when I think of baddie. But hopefully  he's talking about like just a big deal. I mean, my only tip with that... And by the way, guys,  I want to hear your comments. If you start to see... I don't know if I'm not seeing comments  or no one's responded yet, but if you start to see the comments, let me know. I want to hear  what would you do tomorrow? What would you spend your time doing if money... You had $20,000 a month  coming in from renting simple little websites and the world was your canvas. What would you do?  Francesca would go to culinary school. Okay. What would you do? You know what I would do,  Francesca? What? Travel. And that's exactly what I'm doing. That's why you see me in Dubai every  five minutes because I'm just getting it out of my system. I didn't grow up traveling. The idea that  I could make money while I was traveling was so enticing. And that's why you see that I was home.  I got back from Dubai 10 days ago and I'm already in Vegas and I'm literally just getting... I just  like to be moving. I get inspired. I look out. I can see the city. It's like... I don't know.  That's what I would do and that's what I'm doing is I'm traveling. I'm seeing the world. There's so  many places I want to see. I want to go to Kenya. I want to go to India. I want to go to the places  that you don't want to go to. I promise you. I want to go to the freaking ratchet dirty places.  That's more attractive to me. So that's what I would want to do. Fino says... Okay, hold on.  Laura says... Okay, let's go through some of these.",

So if we're talking about baddie in terms of a fatty, in terms of a deal, okay?  My only advice is you got to go in there with complete confidence like you've done it 100 times.  Francesca, you know what we're going to do? I'm going to actually let you answer that because  you disclosed a fatty. And by the way, somebody was in the waiting room. I just missed it.  Whoever you were, come back in. I would love for you to answer your question. But really quick,  Francesca, this is your question because you just closed a freaking $7,500 a month deal.  Tell us. Give us a tip. Favorite ways.  Well, favorite ways is... I don't think it's favorite ways. I think the better answer,  the better question is... The best way to...  Tips. Because the best way to is you just freaking go in, you're confident,  you close the deal. It's the same process. But give us a tip. You smashed that deal.  I've never closed the deal that big. I closed the deal that grew into a deal that was big,  but I've never closed a $7,500 a month deal.  Well, I would say for me, two things. One is prepare early. I got to mentally...  And it doesn't... I know it's...  Yeah, you like to prepare. I know you. If you tell Francesca you got a sales call in an hour,  she's tripping. She needs 24 hours mental prep, which is fine.  It's 12, 12, 12. I just got to prepare, have my charger set up, my headphones set up.  Everything needs to be neat and clean, ready to go. I need to be calm. And then the second is  I follow every single... I still hold the script, not the PDF. I have it printed,  I have it highlighted, following every single thing. Anytime I do that combo, it always works.  Amazing.  Not always, like 90%.  I love that. And you closed that thing like no problem. We do have somebody in the waiting room.  I'm going to let them in. I want to circle back on this. And then guys, we're going to go a little  bit longer today because we can and I want to, and I'm excited to answer questions. And we have some  really good answers. So hang with me just a second. I want to let this person in real quick.  All right. It says PJ. Let's see if he can hear me. Let's see. Let's see. Let's see.  There we go. Can you hear me?  All right. It says PJ. Let's see.  Oh, I think you got to turn off your screens so I don't double hear myself. PJ, can you hear me?  There we go. Can you hear me?  All right.  Yo, what's up, dude?  What's going on? I think I can double hear.  Turn off your...  Turn off your screens so I don't double hear on your side.  Can you hear me?  There we go. Can you hear me?  What's up, dude?  What's going on? I think I can double hear.  There we go. Can you hear me now?  Okay. PJ, do this.

It's off now.  There we go. What's up, dude?  Not much, man. It's been a while. How are you doing?  It's been a while. How are you doing?  Good, man. Where are you tuning in from?  Phoenix, Arizona.  What's up, man? How's things going? How's the weather? Looks like about like Vegas.  Yeah, right. It's cooler right now. It's nice, actually.  Beautiful. So what's up, man? You got anything specific you want to say? What's up?  I just honestly wanted to say thank you to you. I think I've told you and Ryan Dalton,  a lot of the OGs, you guys are awesome. Still kind of like on the frame or the free plan,  trying to like kind of, you know, duct tape everything together to try to get into your  course. I've been somewhat successful, but I have kind of struggled as we kind of talked before.  I went to like Phoenix and I went to Houston. Now I'm kind of doing Glendale, Arizona,  doing some concrete and I feel like I got the ad down and the website, you know, with all the  words, the 2000 plus on the homepage and then the services page, a thousand, but I'm still  struggling a little bit just and I'm using rank and rent, but I'm on the free one with the one  number because like I said, I'm still trying to bootstrap it together, but I'm just trying to  make it work, man. I just honestly wanted to jump on here. I didn't really have that many questions.  I know you kind of answered quite a few already, so I've honestly just been kind of tuning in,  listening, kind of going over my ad stuff while you've kind of been doing the call,  but I just want to jump on and say, what's up, man? I also kind of try to, not to cut you off,  I tried to join a couple of times, but it like, I don't know, I wasn't getting added,  so I was like, whatever, I'll just stay on the Facebook and it's all good.  No, you're good. I think I just didn't see it, so I appreciate you hopping on. So number one is,  dude, you should apply for the scholarship, by the way. I don't know if you haven't already,  but apply for the scholarship and then we'll easily remember you because you came on.  So also message Ashley and get yourself a t-shirt, whatever one you want. So I appreciate  you hopping on. And yeah, dude, I mean, just keep going, bro. I mean, though it's crazy,  I'd say this and message me privately. Maybe we can figure something out, but dude, it's crazy  because how long have you been trying to like, put this together? Like how long have you kind of  been doing this? So I told you before on Instagram, but we haven't talked in a while. I found you like  two years ago and I was doing other things online, kind of developing my skillset, doing Amazon,  some different things.

Doing the SEO, different things,  add some other skill sets that I had. I'm like, how can I take all the skills that I have and  sell them to someone at a fair price? Then I came across you two years later, back in August here.  And that's when I started my first one. I was like, I'm not still that successful in some of  the things I like. Let's give this one more go before I just say, screw it. I'm done with it.  And so I kind of started to do it without even having a website. I sold the first guy on the  pitch in Houston pretty easily. It was like a thousand bucks. I'll do a thousand bucks easy.  I was like, damn, I better get to work. I don't have anything yet, but I proved to myself after  calling five people that it's a good hook. People are like, free leads. I'll try it out. A thousand  bucks. I'm like, I need to make this $2,000 real quick. So that didn't work out just because it  was really competitive in Houston, but it kind of showed me. And I was basically two weeks into  kind of like, you know, re-seeing you again and jumping into it without you. So like,  I'm just going to get started and learn all the free stuff as I go. And I was like, man,  I'm actually seeing some success. I'm kind of like sold on this. Like this is pretty easy. As long as  I'm pretty techie, I'm okay salesman. I'm like, as long as I brush up the things or I find some  things about myself as an entrepreneur, I'm like, I could easily sell it as a deal. A lot easier than  anything else I've ever tried to sell. So it just, it kind of clicked for me, you know?  Yeah, no. Dude, don't give up on the model, man. What happens, one of my buddies was texting me  like two nights ago and this guy, they make him and his wife make a lot of money doing a couple  different things. Like he sells solar and she has like a business. They make a lot of money,  but he's like tired of like knocking doors, right? He's like, I just want to get something  that's residual. So he's asking me about like joining. And his brother-in-law  was like trying to do this. And he's like, how's he doing? And I was like, well, I don't know. He's  like, I think he kind of like got distracted or whatever. And I said this to him. I was like,  this is what happens with almost everybody is they get excited. It makes sense. They stumble a bit  or they just get distracted from something like whatever. It's easier to just do something new  than to figure out the solution to what you're currently working on. And they go and they try  other things or they go back into a job and they, but they always make it back.  And so it was the same with me, dude. I got a couple of deals. I got to, I call it too smart  for the model. I was like, ah, this is too like, this is, I don't want to do this. I don't want to  tell people I do. I'm a market. I have, I own a marketing company. Like that's lame. And I'm like,  then I really learned what lame is. It's not making money. And",

I came back humbly and I was like, all right, let's give this a real shot. And then dude,  I made money, but I didn't do it correctly. I wasn't doing the flat V model. I wasn't  doing a, of course I wasn't doing pre-selling cause I didn't know it.  And I almost gave up again in 2019. I was about to just go be a salesperson. And I was like,  let me just, just like you, I'm going to give it one more chance. And I'm going to figure out this  pre-selling thing. And dude, it's like that story at the beginning of think and grow rich.  Like I was literally three feet from gold. I was eight months away from making a hundred  thousand dollars a month. And I have not made less than that since July of 2020. I haven't  had a month that's less than that. And I was almost to give up on it, dude. I almost settled  for being a salesperson with probably a top potential max earning of like 20 grand a month  if I was killing it. So yeah, dude, don't give up, bro. This is the model I've,  if something else comes along that beats this dude, I'll, I'll jump. Trust me. I'm an opportunist.  I'm not married to this model, but right now this is the best model to become, you know,  it's as passive as it can become. And then you can go do what you want to do. So I want to ask  you this and I'll let you get off, bro. What would you do if you didn't have to worry about money?  20,000. I'm sorry to cut you off. I heard you there, but not to cut you off. I was actually  getting on here so I could actually comment in. Cause I'm like, I don't know if they want us to  comment in on Facebook or on here, but I was like, whether I get on the camera or not, like I'm not  scared of the camera. I'll let you down. I was saying I was going to type in music and travel.  We have similar goals, but probably music and travel. That's cool, man. What music like you'd  want to produce? You'd want to, are you like, you'd be the voice? Like what, what part of music?  DJ. Yeah. Like DJ music producing. That's dope, dude. That's dope. At least at least test it out,  but everything takes money. And I'm like, I want to have that cashflow, uh, you know,  wheel going and working well. So that way, if I try something and it doesn't work, I don't care.  And I still just love it. And I would do it anyway. Yeah, bro. It's, dude, it's such the game,  like no matter what you want to do, I have, uh, one of my friends is a, he like literally creates  music. He's trying to do that, but he's trying to make his money through that.  And dude, he's, he's, I mean, he's been putting out music for two years and I think he's Spotify  checks. He, he just texted me today. His Spotify checks are still less than a thousand bucks a  month. And in my mind, I'm like, dude, just go make 20 grand with renting simple websites.  Right. And then",

Like you can just, it can be like from your soul  and you can really enjoy it. Cause I think he's in that part where it's just like a grind and a  hustle now and it's a job. But if you really love it, like, dude, then the money's just a bonus. So  I love that, bro. And I hope that, uh, dude, you can, if you want to go make 20 grand and go,  go chase it, bro. Dude, I have to, I can't quit now. And just like you said, everything has it  like, you know, Alex or Mosley to that Valley to spare everything you do. So I always think about  that all the time. And I have a lot of great people and sayings from you and other people on  my wall. And I'm just like, if I quit now, it's all for nothing. And I put in about five years  ish into web development. So I'm like, I'm to the point where it is actually going to finally pay  off. And I spent a lot of those years broke in this particular online skills. Um, but I was like,  it's about to pay off big. So, I mean, if I quit now, I'd just be like you, that little, that one  more dig and then, you know, you, you quit or you keep going. So it's like, I think about that all  the time, but I really just, it's not that about making money. It's like, how can I help people  and take my skills? And so I get value, they get value. And it's just like a slam dunk for me,  them and the customer. And that's the only way I tell them, like your customer wins, you win  and I win. Like we get a triple slam dunk and like, who's mad at that? Nobody. It's true, man.  Well, I love it, bro. Please keep, keep in touch. Send me a DM, um, on Instagram or on Facebook and  let's talk and see if we can work something out and apply for the scholarship. Sure. A hundred  percent. All right. Thank you so much. Appreciate you bro. Talk soon. Later. Okay. Let's go through  really quick. Appreciate you guys staying on to the end. Let's go through some of these answers,  give away some swag. We'll hop off. Okay. Yeah, we got a lot of answers. Yeah. I'm going to read  them and I'm going to let you choose like your top favorite three. Okay. Oh, okay. Let's see Anthony.  No, notary says he'd build schools in poverty stricken countries.  Guys, I would love to see every one of these answers. I would love to sit down,  like, I'd love to sit down with you, Anthony, and just, and ask you that, like, I love that  answer, but I would love to know why. Like what, what is it about your past? What is about your  situation? What is it about your life and your experiences that that's the thing that you would  spend your time doing? Because I think it's a very noble, noteworthy thing to do, but I'm always  curious of the why behind the answer. So anyway, that's, I can't because of that kind of time,  but that's a great answer.

And so yeah, I'm actually right now planning on,  so I'm here for Christmas. I want to be with the kids. And then the day after or two days  after I'm either going to be in Africa or Dubai, I just have to get out of the cold. I hate it.  And I don't have to be in it. So I'm not going to be in it. Okay. Fino, if I had 20K,  I'd show my family the world. I like that answer. Kevin says I would spend time in a wood workshop  where I would build and create all day. I also really like that answer. Eric says travel the  world and not have to worry about money at all. Live in a van, do surfing, drive Vespa, have my  own bar at the beach and watch it. That sounds amazing by the way. That sounds like freaking the  Africa, bro. You could do all of that or move to Thailand. But I like that answer a lot.  Fino said 7,500 a month. Yes, that was a real deal that she got. Can you confirm I had nothing to  do with that deal? Like I did not get on that call. I didn't do anything with that deal.  No, you didn't get on the call. I'd love to take credit. You never get on the call.  I never get on Zoom calls. No, I refuse. Francesca's like, hey, can you hop on Zoom? Like, no.  Yeah, that's the answer. I always text her, I'm like, you got this. And you do.  It's like we're taking the training wheels off and you're my daughter and we're teaching  you how to ride a bike. That's all. Jen said way to rock it, Francesca. I'd travel all over Europe  and the world with my wife and kids. Spend three weeks in each location engaging with cultures,  people and their history. It all fascinates me. I love that answer. That's exactly my mindset as  well. Only place I'd probably skip is Italy. Whatever. I'm just kidding. You would love it.  No, I'm going to go. I'm going to go. Okay. Miguel says I would spend my time helping other people.  Jason said, which again, a noteworthy thing to say and to do, Jason Aldridge says travel for sure,  but also volunteer for homeless slash elderly and love to have time to learn to play the piano I  bought six years ago. Rev, amazing by the way. If I don't say amazing, I hope you guys know I like  all these answers. As I'm reading them, I'm like picturing them and it's like taking me places.  Rev says I would discover shamanism because I'm half Athabascan, Native American and half Nigerian,  but grew up adopted. Wow. That's crazy. I have never heard that combination.  Half Athabascan, Native American and half Nigerian. That is amazing actually,  but grew up adopted and would love to learn and discover the roots of my culture. I think that  that's very cool when people want to go and figure out where they came from. Some of us have culture.  People ask me where I'm from and I'm like, I'm just, I'm white. And they're like, no,  people like, no, you're like, I get, what's it called? Arab. I get the Arab comment a lot now  with the beard, which I don't know how to",

Chris, too much Nick for us there,  almost exploded from the strength of multiple Nicks. That was scaring me too.  Kristin, if I didn't have to work because of that incoming money, I'd move on back to the rural,  travel the states with my kids. We don't travel much now, so it would blow their minds. You know  how kids get just when entering a hotel room and go berserk over a new room and jump on the bed of  travel. That's so true, dude. Kids are so pure. My kids, Francesca, you ever stayed at the Trump Tower?  No, actually. You would like it because there's no casino. It's really clean.  They have the bathrobes that you can borrow, and my kids are like, they love that Trump casino  because you can wear the bathroom. Of course, that's three times too long for them, and they  put on huge slippers. They're like, the Trump is so sick. It's such a cool hotel. It's like, bro,  it's a bathrobe. They're like $20 robes, but it's so true. Kevin says I would help my son  manage and promote his music career so he can just focus on creative work and performances. I'd spend  the rest of my spare time traveling with my wife and enjoying retirement. Amazing. Love Nick's story.  So inspiring. Thank you, sir. So much you can do with music now. The sky's the limit. It's so true.  Music's so inspiring. I actually really appreciate people that do that. Porter is the most  unserious person. Porter said he would get Taggy alive. Let me just tell you this last story.  Let's get hold on. I don't know if we have time for that story. The fact that Porter makes $9,400  per month can inspire everyone on this call with that answer, and that is another story for another  time. It's an inside joke, and it's hilarious. Let me just say this. Taggy is this guy that was our  house cleaner in Africa, and the big joke, because Porter's wife actually got pregnant when we were  in Africa, which is weird. Thanks, bro. It's so disgusting. Thanks for doing that. The big joke  is Porter the dad or is the house cleaner the dad? His name's Tegba, but he's very smelly. He's  deodorant, so that's why he's saying deodorant. It's terrible. I hope Teg was not in this group.  Taggy, I'm sorry. Eric says Italy's beautiful, Nick. Okay, I'll go. Don't worry. Learning the  language Italian. Jason Allred's a good one. Any other answers? I'd homeschool my four boys  and sponsor health and fitness programs for the sick and overweight. That's a cool answer.  Okay, let's give away some swag. Let's give away some swag. All right, Jessica.  That's hard. I really like the idea of the kids traveling, jumping on the bed. That just made me  smile. Yeah, I do too. That's Chris. I'm going to give him. Let's give Chris a free swag  T-shirt, message, Ashley. Yeah, I like that answer. What's your second one?  I like the one that Kevin, he would help his son with his like music career and then also travel  with his wife. I like all the traveling ones. It's hard because they kind of all answered  as similar, so it's hard to pick, you know, one.",

Okay, I like the one that says Miguel, I would spend my time helping  other people. It sounds vague, but I get what he's saying. Like you can volunteer,  you can do a lot of stuff. I feel like a lot of people would do,  but you just don't have the time when you have to work.  You know what I was thinking as I was reading these answers is how amazing, like  how beautiful the world would be if people didn't have to worry about money. Like  how the inventions that would come, the music that would come, the art that would come,  I think things would just be better. Like it would just be unbelievable. It'd be really,  really cool. And I think everyone would be more, I think when you travel, you become more open-minded  and I think you're more of a, not everybody, but I think I'm more understanding when people  aren't exactly like me. And yeah, I think that nothing, there's no downside to traveling.  I think you're only become a better person in my opinion. I agree a hundred percent.  Amazing. I think that will do it guys. If you haven't already apply for the scholarship,  if you want to, it's called the thousand days of a thousand day celebrate celebration of renting  shitty websites. Apply, it takes you a few minutes. The links in the description, it's  pinned at the top. Appreciate you guys. Love this group. It's been an amazing three years  and we haven't been on live much because again, people just don't value what they don't pay for.  But I know at some point that each and every one of you, if you guys stay on the path,  we'll end up working together at some capacity. And again, to what like PJ, when he came on,  don't give up because you are a lot closer than you guys think.  You could be eight months away from a thousand dollars, a hundred thousand dollars per month.  So Francesca, thanks for hopping on. Yep. Thank you. Okay. See you guys.",

    "pageContent": " Okay, now that we have the page title and the page description, we are going to create  the H1 tag, text right here.  It's actually pretty simple because the H1 is pretty much the page title just flipped.  So we're going to put the location first and then we're going to put the services.  So just what you put here, we put concrete contractors and concrete company.  So I'm literally just going to put, so I'm going to click in it and I'm going to put  my location, which is in my case, Queen Creek, Arizona, and then you can structure this however  you like.  I think it looks clean if you put a little line there, but you can also just go ahead  and just put the keywords that we used.  So concrete contractors.  This may be too long to fit, also I'm putting that, but I usually like to use the actual  three letters and concrete company and then click out of it.  Let's see what it looks like, okay.  I do like it to be a little more bold and then just double check how it looks like from  a phone.  Yeah, that's fine.  Keep in mind, I know this sounds like silly, but we're only doing this because Google is  going to crawl our website and we're just doing the on-page SEO.  We're not doing this to make it look, because obviously this is the same thing.  Oops.  And then make sure you don't put concrete twice.  Okay, let's delete that out.  Perfect, it should look even better now.  Okay, concrete contractors and concrete company.  You may ask, well, can I just put concrete contractors and company?  No, because the keyword is concrete company, not just company.  You might as well just take out concrete company and just leave concrete contractors if it's  really bugging you.  Okay, next one, stamped concrete.  Okay, same thing.  Same thing as your page title.  Location first, so you flip the page title.  Oops, stamped concrete and decorative concrete.  Make it a little bigger.  Perfect.  Okay, concrete driveway.  I don't remember.  I think concrete installers is what we put, okay.  Queen Creek, Arizona, concrete driveway, and concrete installers.  Make it a little bigger.  Perfect.  Concrete patio.  Queen Creek, Arizona, concrete patio, and concrete walkway.  Okay, and you're done because we're not doing the contact page.  We are also going to cover the meta keywords.  So, we used to fill this section right here.  We don't do it anymore on our very latest sites, but this is up to you if you want to  do it or not.  We don't think that it's going to hurt you if you put meta keywords, but we're not sure  that it's really doing much by adding them.  So, what meta keywords are, it's very simple.  I'm just going to show you how to do it on the home page.  It's pretty much you just add in keywords from your keyword list, and you separate them  with a comma.  And it will tell you right here, separate each with a comma.  So, it would be concrete contractors.  It is just a list of keywords.  Concrete company, stamped concrete.  Make sure that when you're doing this, you're not just copying and pasting it from...  Like, don't ever copy the description for the home page and put it in the service page.  Everything needs to be authentic and made fresh for each page.  Same with the meta keywords.  Even if you're using the same keywords over and over, it doesn't matter. ",

You guys set goals to be at whatever by by Christmas or new the last day of 2025. You're already a month into this thing. We've already got a month gone. That means that whatever you were supposed to hit in Q1, you are now one third of the way  done. That's going to be exciting for some of you. It's going to be painful for others. But whatever the case is, we have a month gone. Anyway, it's shocking. I literally felt like New Year's was yesterday. That's crazy. Okay. Three things. Number one, rank and run engine. If you are new, quickly rank and run engine is our go to tool for this business. If you are outside the US, do not worry. We are working on rolling this out into different countries starting with the  pot, the the most densely populated countries for students inside this group, Australia, Canada, UK, etc, etc, etc, going from there. We are working on that. If you are outside the US and you're like, oh my gosh, I don't know how to do this without. Yeah, you can. Okay, ever. I was able to scale this thing using a bunch of tools cobbled together. It's not ideal, but it's doable. We have you in mind. We're working on it. If you're in the US and you're not using the tool that's on you. It's it's extremely, extremely, extremely, extremely  easy to manage everything one place, do your due diligence and just scale this business. Okay. What I want to say, the reason I'm bringing up ranking engine is I think I made this announcement last. No, I made the post last week, but I didn't make the announcement because by the way, last week guys, thanks to Porter and Jason, or maybe it's just border. I can't remember. I think it was both of them. They went live and in my place. I was actually traveling last Tuesday from Africa to Dubai, but here I am. What I want to say  though is our backlink analyzer tool is live. Okay. So for those of you guys that are paying for three to four tools, paying for majestic and paying for eight, eight trusts and paying for mangles and paying for a SEM rush and paying for a sauna and whatever. Stop. Okay. You're wasting money. You're wasting, uh, whatever you're wasting resources, but more importantly, you're wasting your attention. Right. You're, I remember trying to track down  stuff. Where's this document? Where's that sheet? Just make it easy guys. You can't put a price tag on convenience. You can't put a price tag on the time that you're saving. Um, all I wanted to do is give a shout out to Ryan. I went through the tool when he first launched it. And I very quickly was like, Hey, this tool is amazing. I love it. It's one place. It's simple. It's clean. It doesn't have all the extra crap. However, it's missing in the central component, which is the backlink analyzer. That was about six weeks ago when I told him this in six weeks, he  took my information. He took what I said to him. He designed it with the developers, took it to the developers, put it on a staging platform, took it into production. And it's already live within six weeks. That is the beauty of having this tool that we have in the group, because anything that we see, Hey, um, we need to add this. We need to change this. We need",

    "pageContent": "to get rid of this. We get to build it as we go. So the cool part is that's just version one of the backlink analyzer. And right now you'll notice in the backlink analyzer, you can look at the root  domain. We're going to be adding other ways, looking at the URL, the view from the URL, looking at the path view, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Some of you guys have no idea what I'm talking about. We're going to get into that more and more. Don't worry. Um, that tool is going to get beefed up. That's an individual tool inside of Rank Your Engine. Okay. All I want to say, if you guys get a chance, give Ryan a shout out. He got that thing done in six weeks. Um, you would never even be able to get stuff done with another company because they wouldn't care. And he was able to get that done in six weeks. And it is phenomenal. So guys go check that out.  If you already have an account, just go log into your account on the left-hand side at the bottom. It's the second one from the bottom and it's the backlink analyzer. Go in there, throw in your root domain and go and check out all the statistics, the trust flow, the citation flow, the referring domains, referring IPs, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Okay. Um, by the way, guys, we're, me and Ryan are going to be doing a proper training on how to use the backlink analyzer tool within Rank Your Engine.  We'll be here in the next few weeks, if not this week or next week, next Tuesday. So keep an eye out for that. Um, just so you guys know. Okay. And then again, I'm going to just drop this in the chat. For those of you that are wondering, do not have anything. I'm going to try to do this on my computer, see if it works. Here is the code. This is the code for the, uh, discount for Rank Your Engine. Okay.  Cool. I spent some time in there playing around with it. Just literally, even just today. So go check that out guys. RankYourEngine.com. I just dropped the code. You guys can go check that out. Um, last two things really quick.  Number one, I mentioned this two weeks ago, but guys, January is one of the best times of the year to get deals. When I talked about this two weeks ago, I literally told you guys, I was like, Hey, I have a business owner that I reached out to.  Literally this morning. And then if you guys remember at the end of the call, I picked up my phone. I had a response to that business owner. A couple of days later, I did a live with the business owner. I think it was like two days later.  I did a Zoom call. I'm sorry, with the business owner. And we, I basically said to them, Hey, I know we, things didn't work out in the past. We made some adjustments. Let me and Francesca look at the area you want to target.  Come up with a proposal and do a three month deal where you work with us for three months with the intention that at the end of the three months, we can work together for another six months to a year.  So we got this thing all teed up. We went in, we did the homework. When I say we, Francesca did all the homework and we have given them a proposal and we are supposed to hop on the phone later this week.  Just giving you guys an update. Reach out to those people that you reached out to back in January or",

Be a human and say, Hey, just wanted to circle back around. And you can tell me to go, I think the thing that I said, you can tell me to go and eat sand at any point.  But I do know that there's something we could work together on. If you're willing, I'd love to revisit this conversation, see what we could do and see if there's a way we work together again.  That's such an easy thing to say yes to. Okay. Reach out. January is a phenomenal time to get deals because there's something that clicks in people's brains between December 14th to 31st and January 1 to January 31st.  I don't know what it is. I can't explain it, but something changes inside of people. Okay. Reach out. It takes a second. It takes a little bit of hustle, takes a little bit of sweat and you're done. Okay.  Last thing I want to cover really quick is 3.0. It is coming along very nicely. I spent an hour on Monday. I spent an hour today. I'm spending one to one and a half hours per day working on the 3.0 version, working on auditing 2.0.  What can we get rid of? How can we make it shorter? How can we make it more to the point? What do we need to add? What, you know, all kinds of different stuff.  So I just want you to know that is in the works. It will be out before the end of quarter two. Sorry, end of quarter one before the start of quarter two.  Do not think there is something that you're missing in version 2.0 that version 3.0 is magically going to have that's going to make you millions of dollars by you not doing anything different.  Okay. Ninety five percent of the content is going to be the exact same. We are just going to be changing the way it is delivered and presented and the way you are going to consume it, which I think is going to radically change and help with the success of the students in this group.  We're going to be adding some stuff, taking some stuff away, but I don't want anyone sitting here, but I'm going to wait for 3.0. That is a stupid strategy. Go make some freaking money today.  Get ready, get excited for it. I am working on it at this point almost daily and looking super excited to releasing that for you guys. Okay, so that's it, guys. I'm going to bring on Zach Powell.  I think I'm going to intro Zach before I bring him on because it's always a little bit better for me to do it without embarrassing him. I am going to turn on the AC. You guys are going to give me about 10 seconds because I'm so hot in his office. Give me one second.  All right, guys, quick intro on Zach Powell. If you guys haven't listened to any of the trainings that we actually should probably check really quick to make sure you guys consider me. I can't see any comments, by the way.  I'm just kind of doing this off the seat of my pants. Okay, there we go. Let's see if I can see anything. People can still hear me. Let's see. Okay, I think we're still good.  11 minutes ago. If you guys can still hear me, I just have to keep canceling or deleting the app or killing it and bring it back on. But anyway, let me give you guys a quick intro on Zach and then Zach,",

    "pageContent": "he's in the waiting room. I'm going to be bringing him along with somebody that he's actually worked with personally.  Zach Powell is a, he's actually a member of this group. He's a student in here as of I think it was back in 2022 when he joined. But Zach, when he started, he was in a position where he needed to replace his income very rapidly. He had a job, we're going to get into his story, whatever.  He had a job that he needed to replace that income. He had like a severance or something, a few months worth. He's like, I got to replace my income by this date so I can keep doing this thing and my wife's not going to let me. Okay. And so he already bought a program.  And I think he bought one a year before that he purchased this one. And he looked at it and he's like, dude, the quickest way for me to be able to get out of my job to be able to replace that income is going to be through SEO. Okay.  Now, when I say SEO, I'm talking about taking the website, ranking it at the top of Google and doing it like as a, as a service. Okay. Not doing it where it's on your website, but doing it as a service for a client.  I used to be very, very against this because I tried to do this. It was actually what I tried to do to replace my income when I quit my door-to-door sales job.  But I did it incorrectly. I was targeting the wrong niches. I was going for the wrong type of deals. I was talking to the wrong type of people, but Zach did it in a very smart way.  He does it in this really smart, predictable way that he can literally, he's got this thing on autopilot and he's got actually has other people closing deals for him.  And so he's like just the puppet master behind the scenes that's pulling the strings. Okay.  And he does it in such a way that he perfectly tees these clients up to go and then sell digital assets to them that he builds.  He's making over 50k a month. He just barely built this brand new house for his family that he also uses and kind of like doubles as a office for his employees.  And you're probably going to see the background and everything. He used to be in an office and now he does that.  But on top of that, guys, he's one of the most humble dudes I know. He's a family guy and he's literally living the life of his dreams.  He's surfing or mountain biking in a new country. It seems like almost every week. It's probably more like every month or every month, but he's living the life that you want to live.  I think it's really cool. So today, Zach is going to be teaching us and he's going to be talking about this as someone that's doing over 50k a month, how to become a $50,000 per month sales monster.  And I'm just going to be over here enjoying. I don't even have questions prepared because Zach hasn't prepared.  But as questions come, I'm going to be asking if you guys have questions, I want you to drop them.  Just know this guy has my stamp of approval and I don't let a whole lot of people have any kind of a platform inside of this group because I don't trust a lot of people.  This is somebody that I actually trust. So I'll be bringing Zach on.  And I'm also going to be bringing on Vinny, who is also ironically a student of this program in digital landlords.  He joined back in 2022 as well. Zach helped him and showed him how to do what",

Get your questions ready and let's get into this right now.  Zach Powell.  Hey, Nick. Hey, Vinny. How's it going, guys? What's up? Oh, Vinny, there you are, bro. Can you hear me?  I hear you. How's it going, Nick? It's going great. I'm going to give. Good to see you, bro. It's been a minute.  Good to see you, Vinny. Zach, I see you a lot. Vinny, I haven't seen you in a minute. Good to see you, dude. It's been a while. Yeah, you too.  So real quick, I'm going to give Zach co-host just because of my Internet glitches.  Then, Zach, you can keep going. I'll jump back on. I don't know. I have Internet troubles.  It's it's wild here in Dubai, which you'd never think would be the case.  So anyway, Zach, welcome to Call Dude from tuning in from Queen Creek, Arizona.  And Vinny, tell everyone where you're at right now. I'm right next to Zach. I'm in Gilbert, Arizona.  Have you always been there or did you move there recently?  No, I moved here about two years ago.  Did you move there after you started working with Zach or before?  So I actually first met Zach like a year before I moved here officially.  I was here visiting and we met up and then I moved later.  I love it, dude. It's a great area. It's a it's a cool area.  Yeah, I'll take the heat all day over the snow. So I get the drop.  Zach, I gave you an intro. Vinny, maybe you can just kind of and I don't know if you guys are on,  but Vinny was a member of and is a member of Digital Landlords.  He also started working with Zach. Zach started kind of mentoring him on what he does  and landing these very simple SEO deals and was able to scale his agency up.  And Vinny, not to put you on the spot, but maybe you can let everyone know  kind of where your agency sits right now in terms of revenue just to give some context.  Yeah, I'm at about forty four thousand monthly recurring right now.  Most of that is directly due to both of you guys.  Yeah, bro. Forty four thousand per month. That's insane, dude.  Last time I talked to you, you're making like eight or something like that.  Zach, what are you at right now per month?  We're at fifty eight.  Fifty eight. So Vinny's biting at the heels, dude. Let's go. He's coming.  I know. He's coming for me. It's awesome. I love seeing it.  What a lot of people don't know because I've had people like, for example,  Ryan Dalton, he's he went up to eighty seven K like two years.  It's actually the biggest flex ever is when somebody that you've helped makes crazy money.  It's not intimidating or threatening. It's like the best.  It's like when your kid scores a basket, you know, in bad years, just balls.  So I'm like, hey, it works. It works. Keep doing it. It works.  It's 100 percent, man. So it's going to be exciting.  It's going to be exciting. So we have between the three of us,  we're making a fair amount of money",

    "pageContent": "doing a very simple thing on the Internet.  Now, Zach and Vinny are there.  They're working with clients in a very strategic way where they manage their SEO, their websites.  They've got it. They've got it really dialed in where they don't have to do a whole bunch of,  you know, back and forth. We'll talk more about that.  We've talked about that in their lives. We're going to keep this mainly on sales.  I'm obviously doing the same thing, but on my own websites.  OK, the thing I like about what you guys are doing, though,  and the reason why I've always kind of giving you a stamp of approval, Zach and Vinny,  is because you guys are doing it in a very strategic and smart way.  When I was doing SEO, I was just going for big clients.  I was going for the big, juicy four thousand dollar per month, high maintenance,  you know, prima donna clients, and it just didn't work.  And it was terrible. You guys are building these brick by brick businesses.  I bet you your forty four thousand dollars, for example, Vinny,  is spread out in such a way that if you lost a client today, you're not going to lose sleep.  Am I wrong on that or is that pretty accurate?  That's exactly right. Yeah. Yeah, I love that.  So I've talked enough. I want to turn the time over to Zach, Vinny. I'll chime in.  It was questions, but I'm going to shut my mouth.  You guys are the ones that are combining right now for over one hundred thousand dollars per month,  doing just basic, simple five hundred, three hundred, six hundred dollar a month  SEO deals with business owners. So you guys are doing a lot of deals.  Let's talk about how to become a sales monster. Fifty thousand dollars per month sales monster.  Awesome, man. Yeah, thanks for bringing me out. Appreciate it.  So I think real quick, I'll just talk about like what Vinny and I have done  and then we'll talk about how to become a sales monster and sales beast.  So essentially, you know, I started with Legion and it was tough for me.  And I was like getting all these easy opportunities to win SEO deals.  My dad's a carpet cleaner. So I was like, sure, I'll do your website, dad.  And then his friends and they just started stacking up and I saw the route to quit my job,  which was my main goal. And so I just kept taking all these SEO clients  and systemized it where it was just like stacking easy wins, easy wins, easy wins.  And so Vinny has done the same model and has crushed it.  There's more info. I'll just throw it in the chat if you want to check out.  I like showing my strike page and stuff. ZachPowell.co.  There's super basic landing page, has like my strike page, tells my story.  Check it out if you want. But I guess Vinny, if you. Cool.  And then Vinny, if you want to kind of tell about your journey of like Legion,  what appealed with SEO, what you did, how it helped you scale, that'd be great.  And then I can go into like some sales training that I prepared.  So you have any thoughts on, I guess, the Grow SEO program or like how it helped you  being in digital landlords and being in Grow SEO and kind of your thoughts on that?  Yeah, yeah, for sure. So, you know, getting started like you in Legion,  obviously it takes time to kind of start ranking these sites and then you can",

It is kind of expensive, right?  To get going. And then you kind of introduced me to focusing more on SEO,  which doesn't really take much expense or time.  You can just come in and you start working on the client site right away.  You know, they're paying you from day one, regardless of where the site is ranking.  So it was just a good way for me to kind of start building my client base quickly and with little overhead.  So I really kind of hit that hard after I saw the first few deals come through and it was going smooth.  And the rest is history. Great, great coaching program.  I've learned so much from you, from both of you guys.  You know, as far as SEO and selling more than anything, you got to be able to sell.  And that's what I've learned. Like until you have a sale, you don't have a business.  So there have been many times where I've sold something before I even knew how I was going to deliver.  And like, that's OK. You know, if you're committed to delivering, then get the sale and then you figure it out.  So that's been my biggest takeaway from both of you guys.  Just get the sale and then move forward.  Does that kind of cover what you wanted, Zach?  Anything else? Yeah, man, that's awesome.  Yeah, I love what you said about sales, too, because sales is like that foundation.  When you have those confidence and knowledge, you'll just go crush it.  So I'll prepare some thoughts on that today.  Usually I share my screen on my iPad, but I'm just going old school with some paper today.  We're going to talk about being a sales beast.  So first thing to talk about.  Let me do this quick, Zach. Let me try to unshare or let me.  I'm seeing in the chat somebody said, I can't see you.  And I don't know why that is.  Porter says, I can't see you and hear bits and pieces.  I can hear you guys. Can you guys hear me?  Yeah. Yeah, yeah.  Maybe whoever else is on, maybe Porter needs to get out of the freaking jungle wherever he's at  and get off the track and watch this on some actual Wi-Fi.  That could be part of the problem.  But just in case it's not just a Porter problem.  Just kidding, Porter.  Can anyone else confirm that you can hear us before Zach gets into this?  So that I'm not being the only ones getting this training.  It might be good for us to check it out.  If you can hear us, let me know.  If you can see us, let me know.  By the way, I have to keep killing my app and then refreshing.  My Facebook lives are probably the worst thing that's ever happened, but also convenient.  So let's see here.  So Kevin says he can only see me.  We can hear, just not see you.  You guys can see me though, right?  Yeah, I can see all three of us.  Let me take off the...  That's so wild, dude.  We're just voices in Nick's head right now.  That's crazy.  Okay, well, only see you, Nick Wood.  That's wild, dude.  That's wild.  Okay, let me try to get one more thing.  Hold on.  I'm going to remove spotlight from me, remove spotlight from you.  And then there's",

Sorry about that, guys.  The game here.  So Jason, I read last comments that we can hear, just not see you.  By the way, Zach and Vinny, can you guys see the comments coming in real time?  I can't.  I can't, yeah.  I'm Facebook.  I don't have it pulled up.  Okay.  Zach, as soon as you get a confirmation, I'm going to have to keep killing the app.  I can't even see anything in real time.  If anyone confirms they can see us now, then we can move forward.  The last comment I see is from Jason.  Yeah, everyone is just saying they just see you.  But they can hear us.  I mean, I'm fine to just talk it out and they can look at you smiling if they want.  You know what I can try to do, brother, is you have co-hosts.  So here's what I'm going to do.  I'm going to hop off.  You just start your thing and then you just let me in.  And let's see if that solves the problem.  I'm good.  I'm actually going to make you host, not just co-host.  Let me try that really quick.  See if that solves the problem.  One more time, guys.  Can you see Zach now?  Because it says I'm the host, or it says Zach's the host.  If they can't, I'm going to just hop off.  You guys just start going and then I'll hop on and see if it'll keep it on you.  Because you're going to be the one doing the primarily talking.  Any other comments in there?  Still just you that they can see.  Okay, I'm going to hop off.  You just get going, Zach.  Obviously, if I hop off, they're going to have to see somebody.  So they have to see you.  If it goes black, let me know.  I'll hop right back on.  Just let me back in here in a second, okay?  Sounds great.  Great.  Actually, you know what, Zach?  You better start.  Can you push record, please, so we can record it on your end?  Oh, yeah.  Record to the cloud.  Here we go.  It says I can't record to the cloud here.  Can you record to your computer?  Yeah, I can do that.  Let's see.  Record to this computer.  That worked.  Recording.  Here we go.  All right.  Sounds good.  I'm going to hop off.

And we're going to be, um,  Doing the same thing to this one in like a week or two, right?  Cause those are, as you know, with your experience,  like that's just a common thing.  And it's one of the negative drawbacks of the search campaigns for  sure.  Um, okay. So with that, we're going to do.  Screen share.  I'm so slow at this stuff today. All right.

You know,  Yeah, Jason, that's totally normal. Oh no. Unpaid balance. Oh,  Uh,  My experience with the unpaid balance thing is, um,  If you search the group,  you'll see a bunch of chats about it like from like a year or two ago.  But typically what's like,  there's something that's tied to your Gmail or a credit card or something  like deep inside the world that Google could be store music,  YouTube or something.  So if you, if you're looking for unpaid balance,  like you're looking for something that's like,  I'm looking for something, um,  getting you a gift card,  something that's like got a weird balance on it.  And that's what's holding you up.  So just check that go back through your history.  And, um, eventually you'll be able to find it. Okay.  Hopefully that helps, but.  It does happen. You just gotta go find it.  I've had stuff for like 72 cents.  But I don't know.  So.  All right.  So we'll, we'll hop in. If you have anything, you know, the rules, just yell, scream, stop me.  If I start getting too nerdy or not into something like make sure we,  we bring it back around. So, all right. Okay. Let's get started. Okay, guys. So we're going  to set up a, it's a different type of search campaign. The first one that we set up is a call  only ad. So today we're going to set up one. That's going to be a website traffic ad, but it's  good. It still has the options to get calls. It's just, it's just displayed a little differently.  They're both valuable in a perfect world. I would set up call only and the website traffic, but  sometimes when you do that, you like double your ad spend. So for today, today we're going to do,  we're going to set up a one for an Atlanta towing site. This is a one pager,  right? Super simple. We only one pager for towing. Obviously like call only would be better  for towing, but we're going to set this up with website traffic. And then I can always change  this later on the other end of it, but for display purposes, we're going to do this. So  we've created the campaign, right? We do that just like in the, in the original training,  you go to your MCC, you set up your sub account, and then you go from there.  Okay. So we're going to set up new campaign. Okay. We're going to come to here. It's going  to ask us like what our guidance is, right? So we're going to select website traffic.  And then it's going to ask us what platform we want to be on. And we're going to say search.  Okay. Now it's going to ask our website. We're going to go here.  We're going to copy that. We're going to paste that in. We're going to say, yeah, man,  page view for sure. Then we're going to put here.  This stuff right here, like I'm not a",

I prefer to do max clicks, especially  at the beginning as I'm getting data. I'm then a fan at like month three or four moving into  conversions, because there's going to be all of this data that Google's compiled. And then it's  going to help me do better conversion rates. If my experience, my opinion is if you set  conversions up in the beginning, Google's going to waste more of your money. So I'm not a fan.  So I go here. I go to clicks. Okay. Now what I want to do is I want to set a maximum cost per  click because Google is going to always want to spend my money. It'll give me $30 clicks,  $40 clicks or whatever. So in this campaign, I have several keywords that Francesca provided me.  I just did Mangles. I set it up over Atlanta. You can use SEMrush. I just prefer Mangles for local  because I use Ahrefs for like other stuff. So the one I put in was towing. That's right here.  You can see the CPC, the search volume, and then these are some of my other keywords that we're  going to use. And you can see search volume and CPC. Now this is what Mangles says. This has been  a question I've seen a couple of times. SEMrush says this. Mangles says that. But then it's actually  this. Okay. But remember, this is used as a guidance. This tells us if it's good or not  or if we want to, you know, kind of what to expect or budget for. But when I'm actually here,  okay, when I'm actually in here, what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to my tools and settings.  I'm going to click it. I'm going to go to my keyword planner. I'm going to right click that.  I'm going to open it in a new link. Okay. I'm going to hit discover new keywords and then I'm going to  do a couple of different. What was one? Keys locked in car? Locked keys. Oh yeah. Locked car keys.  Something like that. And then I'm going to change this to Atlanta.  I have specific like areas in Atlanta. Do you want me to tell you or we can go back and do that later?  We will do that, but let's do that a little later. Because what this step is, that's a good  question. This step is just trying, we're trying to like get what Google is going to tell us our  high and low range of CPC so we can set our max limit. And so we don't have to be as specific as  unless you're like going to go completely outside of the metro area, then we don't necessarily need  that. Does that make sense? It's like if we were going to run it in like Stone Mountain, but call  it Atlanta, then we would definitely want to look over that area. But if we're going to be in and  around this area, that's fine. It's like the New Orleans one where we like, we just use New Orleans  because that's going to have the most data, right? Yeah. Okay. So we hit save and then we hit get  results. Okay. And then here we go. So remember like that 1,600, like those are similar  results on what I saw here, maybe a little bit more, a little bit. Yeah, similar, close enough,  not totally off. Okay. And then I'm going to go here and it's going to be a little bit more  high",

In a perfect world, we always want to be higher than the high bid,  but you can see like, these are like $2 higher than what we got from Mangles right now for some of  these keywords. It's not that one's better or one's worse. It's just, these are just differences in  the tools. And then we're going to go ahead and hit save and then we're going to go ahead and hit  it. It's not that one's better or one's worse. It's just, these are just differences in the tools.  But I like to go here and just see what CPC is like, I want to spend $15 for locked car keys.  Maybe, maybe not. I don't know what the customer makes on it. So, but I also see how low that is.  And then I look at these at being like $8, $7, $8. What's this one, another car locksmith. Okay. So  the locksmith ones are higher. That's fine. We want to get those, the tow jobs, mostly these  guys like doing the tow jobs. Sometimes there's people that are specific about getting keys out  and all that. So what we'll do is we look around here. So it looks like $8, $7, I see $9 record  service. That's, that's going to be typically like that term is typically like a bigger tow service  or bigger tow truck. So just looking around, let's see.  Okay. So I'm going to kind of use like this one. So we're going to choose $8.75 as our max click,  because that's about, that'll put me a penny higher than a majority of what these main keywords are.  Okay. So I'm going to go back to here and then hit and that's that. Okay. So I hope that's,  hope you guys understand why we're doing that. And, and we'll go from there.  Eman Coles asks, can we do an analytics and GTM conversion tracking overview for calls and forms?  Yeah, I, yeah, we can set that up for a future office hours. I'm not going to do it today though.  Okay. Now with towing, like this is one that's interesting for like towing,  you can set up only bid for new customers, but I always figure like if someone's like looking  and then they go to look and they come back, like you don't want that ad to not be displayed to them  when they're going to make the call. So I kind of leave it off. It becomes an issue. Then we'll,  we'll change it. Then you go here. So the next step it's going to remember it's going to be on  the search network, but look at this, even here, they want to automatically put you on the search  partners and display network, but we were going to get off of those. So we uncheck those and then  it's going to ask us for our locations. Okay. So here we're going to hit enter location  and then Francesca, you have a few sites for us, right? Yes. Let me pull it up.  It's in my email. Just give me one second.  Okay. So I have  Lake city, which I have no idea what it's at.  Does it exist?  Yep. There it is. Funny how as I typed it in, it gave me a zip code.  Yeah. Then there's east point.  There it is. East point, Georgia. Then I have union city.  Okay. And then he just said college. I wonder if,  if it's that college park that I saw earlier, when you type the union city. ",

Like there's some stretches here of like the interstate.  I'm trying to remember. It's been so long since I've done anything in Atlanta.  Can you do it by, should we do it by radius or not really?  Well, we could, but like, you know, there's areas of Atlanta he may not want to serve or go into,  because it's kind of a pain in the butt getting around there. So  um, there's no way for us to like,  and dry. Um, well, yeah, we can. It's just, we don't know where he wants to go. That's specific  where he wants to go, but like, we can make like, um, yeah, if you, I'll tell you what, um,  maybe after this call, if you want to like, maybe talk to him or met tomorrow or something and just,  just ask, like, do you want those specific locations or is there like a radius you want  to set up? You can just tell them like, Hey, like something like, Hey, we're, we want to set up  getting some ads going just to like, get you some quick wins while we're ranking stuff. Like, you  know, I got these areas, but is there like a certain like region or, or, you know, maybe give  them some of these other names that you see and see if he's cool with that. Cause sometimes people  are like, Oh, I don't want to go into that neighborhood at all. Um, so you can hit them up.  Yeah. And they will make changes on that. Is that okay? Yeah. Okay. Cause this is a pretty  good population with right now. So, um, okay, we go to there. So we set that up everybody. Um,  and then we go to location options. And now towing is an interesting one because like,  we want to do like typically like presence of like people in or regularly in the targeted area,  but a towing, like, especially near an airport, like you could have tourists,  you can have people there for business. You can have, you know, uh, family members watching  people play sports, like playoffs are coming up, like all sorts of stuff. So like in this particular  one, typically like for our like home service technicians, we want to have the presence one  right here. We want that one targeted because we don't want that, but for towing, cause those  people want it now. We don't really care where they're at. We just want them in our area.  So this one, we might want to try this presence or interest. So people that are like,  like here and they're interested in that, that might be something to play with on a towing niche.  But for right now, I'm just going to turn this on and we'll see if we need to switch it later.  Okay. And languages, English, the audience segment, like we're not really getting involved with that  with what we're doing. Okay. We want this off and we go here. Um, Francesca, 24 hour towing.  Yeah. Cool. All right. And then we hit next. Okay. I'm going to go up here and we're going  to add our keywords and stuff. Okay. And now it's going to add, it's going to add that one.  Here's all of Google's keywords that they want to, that they want to do. Um, those are interesting.  Okay. All right. So I've put in, um,",

And this helps me do a proper format that I don't have to  like, um, go into here and like Adam and put the quotations or the brackets or whatever.  And just as a reminder, when I have like a word that has nothing around it, that's called the  broad match. When I have it with the quotation marks around it, that's called the phrase match.  And when I have these brackets around it, that's called an exact match. Um, broad match means like  anything closely related to that. It's going to show an ads on. That's like what we saw  with the search campaigns. If I put quotations around it,  what that's saying is like, let's say I typed in, like, what is the best 24 seven roadside  assistance near me? My ads going to show, because that phrase is included in the search query.  If I put the bracket around it, it's only going to show up for that exact search query. Okay.  I prefer for lead gen and what we're trying to do and getting some data is the phrase match.  You can always make tweaks later. Um, you can do broad match, but I only do that if I just have  zero idea what's going to work or not. And I just want to see what sticks. Okay. But typically  that's going to be a big waste of ad spend. Um, okay. So we're going to go here. I go here and  click wrap keywords, wraps, my keywords. I go here where it says phrase match. I'm going to  click wrap keywords, wraps, my keywords. I go here where it says phrase match. It's  formatted in for me. I select it. I copy it. I go back. I go back here. Um, I'm going to  do this real quick before I delete those other ones. Um, and Francesca with this, like these  24 hour ones, were you guys getting any, um, like 24 hour stuff on your search terms?  I just want to make sure that we have. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to try. I'm going to add like  road service. That's, that's probably a decent one. Um, maybe keys locked in car.  So sometimes Google doesn't give you good suggestions, but for something like this,  it's like, that might be, might be helpful. Um, especially like the overnight hour,  someone's going to be looking for like that all day one, you know? Um,  okay. So you guys can see like, right, we're just kind of adding them. You can see that I'm  putting these quotations on them. Right. And so like road service, keys locked in car, like,  you know, that'll, that phrase match will cover 24 hour, 24 seven. Um, you know,  who can get my keys locked in my car? Like type of thing, you know, those type of phrases,  roadside assistance. I think we already got roadside. Do you have roadside? Let's do roadside.  Yeah, we have roadside. All right. Cool. Okay. Now I'm going to delete all these  Google suggested ones because Google likes money.  Okay. So we're going to set those up. Okay. And now  I'm going to hit, I can have that set. I'm going to go down here real quick. I'm just going to hit  done. It's just like my stupid way of saving it. Okay. All right. Um, okay.

And just like in the last time we want to try  to get this to like good or to excellent good is going to be about three fourths of the way  around the circle. Excellent. It's going to be all the way around the circle. Um, we definitely  want those to be there and we add headlines that are, um, that are geared towards our  main keywords and or services. Um, sometimes if you're not sure, like, um, Google will make  some suggestions for you. Okay. And you can use some of those and, um, and then get that going  for you. So, um. May not allow that, but we're going to see if it'll let me keep the 24 seven  that.  Okay.  Remember how we were doing this the other day? Like they give you these,  like they give you some of these to use, which are great  if they coincide with your website, your web headlines and your keywords. It's great.  Um, do they do gas service, gas fuel? Like, do they bring gasoline?  I don't know if that's the actual search term used, but that's what Google picked up. So I'm  just going to go with it now and we'll double check it. As you know, like once we set this up  a couple, two, three days later, it'll tell us something. It'll make different suggestions  for us, but we'll try to do that. Um, let's see. Okay. That's awesome. You guys hear the  gardener? Go inside and listen to kids. Can you hear the gardener next door?  I don't. Oh, good. Okay. Maybe these headphones work. Awesome.  Is this person a AAA roadside? Do they take AAA? Do you know?  No, no. Okay. I'll put it on the list of things to ask.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Let's see what other keywords can we throw in there?  I'll leave space for like the AAA. If you can find that out, that'd be cool.  Um, maybe like affordable towing. That's not really a big one to trick service.  Do you know if they have like heavy equipment, like heavy wreckers or like are they just doing  cars? Do you know? Um, well, like accidents. Yeah. Sometimes like, like some, some local areas,  like a wrecker will be like certain type of tow trucks. Sometimes they're the bigger ones or  like they have the cranes on them or the booms or something. I have to ask. Okay.  Okay. I would, yeah, I would leave it if you want.  Yeah. Okay. Let's see. What else can we do here?  Boom.  We'll see if I can get one.  There you go. Um,  like did you already put flat tire, um, like repair or something like that? So I think you put.  I think I did. I put something. I put flat tire replacement. I'll put flat tire repair.  And I'm going to leave this one open in case we do AAA or like an insurance brand or something.  I'll leave that one open, but we're already at excellent. So that's good.  Um, and we didn't even try a description yet. Um, okay. Do you guys have, I know you guys have used  towing before. Do you guys have some descriptions that you've used in the past that you're aware of?  The only, um, till we know we do, we actually don't even run ads anymore.  But I can.  That's okay.

Okay. Okay. Here we are. We are back. Okay. So we just, I just copied, uh,  what we use right with the group. So, um, that's fine. Uh, we specialize and  and towing  not keys,  but tire repair  and more call for free quote, the local, affordable  professional, the truck company  and the Atlanta area. Okay. So we'll call those good for right now. We'll come up with some other  ones later, um, and do that. Okay. So for everyone following along. So, so far, we've set everything  up. Um, we spent the time to put in the headlines. It showed you how like Google will help you  sometimes. Sometimes it doesn't, but a lot of times it does. But you want to remember, like we  also went into keyword planner, where I looked at some volume and stuff and I'm able to see some of  the main keywords and I just use some variants. And just by doing that, I'm going to be able to  keywords and I just use some variants. And just by doing that, like I already started off my ad  strength into excellent, which is good in three, four days, it's going to be different, but it's  always helpful to start off there. And then you can always change it from there. The descriptions  that just stick with the simple one that works. You don't have to get too fancy, but you can do  that. Um, so because this is a, a single, um, uh, a single one pager, we're not going to do site  links. Um, we're not going to do call outs. Okay. But one thing we're going to add here,  so we're going to, so I went here, it says more assets. I'm going to scroll down and I'm going  to add a phone number and add calls. So I'm going to add that to this, right? I'm going to go to the  website, copy that, put that in there, like, give us a call. Right. Okay. And I can now  this part, because it's a 24 hour service, I can leave this on for the calls. But let's say that  like I was setting up, setting this up for like, um, you know, like Francesca's tree trimming site,  um, like maybe she doesn't want to get calls all night and all day. So like I will,  I will set her, her, um, maybe set up the call part, like this little call add-on. I only let  this run during like maybe 30 to 45 minutes before and after close of business. Um, and then  everything else will be running other than that. So then we'll hit save. We'll say, cool. We hit  apply. It applies that to that. You don't have to worry about snippets, lead forms, any of that  other stuff at this point. We hit done. We hit next. Now it's going to ask for our daily budget.  Um, so it doesn't, let me see if I can do this here. So sometimes,  sometimes it gives us estimates. A lot of times it doesn't.  Okay. Um, but knowing that like Atlanta, it was like eight",

Um, and then as soon as I type that in, I haven't agreed to this yet, but you can see  right here, like it given me an idea of how many weekly clicks I can get, what the weekly cost is,  and then what the average CPC is. Like, I don't know how accurate that is right away, but it gives  you a good starting point. Okay. So we're going to start off with that. And only cause this is  towing and it's in the Atlanta area. So it's going to be, and, and, and Francesca can,  can chime in on this. Like you make your money and a lot of volume and towing. And so you want  their phones ringing all the time. That's how they pay you. And that's why they keep paying more.  Right. Okay. And you guys are working on going to probably, you guys have a full website coming up  and doing the SEO and all that stuff. I'm sure at some point. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So we'll go ahead and  hit next.  Okay. So you guys see up here, you'll see in the video I made earlier today,  I talked about how we want this to be up to a hundred. Don't worry about that right now,  because Google's like wanting to add all these things that just going to take your money away.  But remember, like we're going to hit publish. It's going to take two days of policy review  and then five days of learning before anything really like good happens. So we're not, I don't  mess with them. When I first set it up, I set it up, I let it sit for two or three days. And then  I come in and then I make some of the recommendation changes to increase my optimization score.  And then we do that with this one. We'll pop on and we'll either record it and post it,  or I'll pop in live like I did earlier and show you the changes and how to get it back up to a  hundred on this site. And let's go through here. I just kind of overview what I'm seeing. Yeah.  Okay. And you can see up here guys, like this is one of the things like it wants me to add  site links to get my optimization score up, but I don't have any other web pages because it's a  single pager. So it makes no sense to do site links. Right. And I'll show you how to get around  that. And we hit publish. And there we go. So we are now under review. Here you go. We got policy  review and it'll give us some impressions and some clicks. And then it'll kick us into the  learning right here. Eligible learning. That's a five day, that's a five day process post  passing policy review. And then it just gives you a summary of everything.  And then I think that's it. Francesca, is there anything that I can  go over that you think I missed or didn't explain well enough or anything like that?  I think you did really good. The only thing that I can think of, maybe people will be like,  wow, that's a lot of money per day. But it is a little different because I usually will keep in  mind the first one or two days, obviously it's not really doing anything. And even afterwards,  but I do keep checking it to see how much we're actually spending. We just want to set it high  enough that it will produce, especially at first.",

They get clients that come to them  from big areas because they know they can do big stuff. So when you do that, you get people,  you have to run bigger budgets for them. You can't run a $15 a day budget and expect results for  Atlanta for Tony. This is not going to happen. But that's a great point. We've had some other areas  where like, you know, just because you put $55 a day doesn't mean it's going to spend $55 a day.  This campaign may because there's a lot of volume and we'll make those adjustments,  but like we have the, there's the landscape or yeah, there's a landscape one we were working on  and we've had to adjust the budget higher to a lot for more potential clicks per day. But I don't  think we've hit the budget once, like the daily budget. We haven't even come close to it, right?  Yeah. So, okay. I think that's it. Okay.

I'm going to give them like  15 seconds and then we're going to kick out. So just because of the delay. Yeah. The delay is weird.  I always laugh at Nick because like, he's like, okay, bye. And you're like,  what? He just, where'd he go? He doesn't even finish the by when he sits out. I think it's funny.  And my videos are probably the same. I have to say, I've never watched one of my videos to the end.  So I don't know. All right. Okay. I'm not seeing any comments come in. So we're going to,  we're going to end it. Thank you again for hopping on and helping. Thank you. Everyone  appreciate your experience and expertise in it. So, all right. We'll talk to you later. All right.  Bye. Okay. Bye.",

    "pageContent": " Do you always go for six-month agreement or go for 12 and reduce to six?  You can go whatever the hell you want. Like it depends like  Like honestly for me and this is the same thing  I like the reason I like six months ray is because I personally I  Like I don't want to be stuck with someone that sucks  Like just as bad as they don't want to be stuck in a contract. I don't want to be stuck in a contract  I had this exact same thing happen with a piece of uh, with a property that I own a  Uh an office i'm subleasing all the little offices out and we had this client come in  And or this potential tenant and they were like, yeah, we'll probably just do a 12 month and honestly i'm like  I don't know how much money these guys have they say they're gonna park their vehicles outside  They kind of seem like they're like, I don't know. I was just getting this vibe and i'm like I told my wife  I'm like, let's just do a six month so that we are not stuck with these bastards for for a year  And  They've been really good so far  But we did a six month and honestly like their vehicle like they parked their vehicles in the house or at the office  They're not super nice vehicles. They paid in cash. I'm like do these guys even have money and honestly  A couple days after we signed the six month. I told I turned to my wife. I'm like, aren't you glad we did six months?  So ray the reason I do a six month instead of a 12 typically is because I I honestly  Who knows maybe I get a better offer maybe I find somebody else that's willing to pay more money  So I would specifically tell you if you're if you're at a price point  You don't think is what you want to be at do a shorter agreement  Ask kareem because I think it was him  He told me the same exact thing as he he was going for like a six month ended up doing a two month  And he's like dude, i'm actually kind of glad I did a two month now because i've been absolutely crushing it  So now at the end of you know in the next four weeks, he's gonna be able to bump that up  So that's just my personal thing  There's a pro though to having a 12 month because then you have to worry about it  So, um, I know burhan, uh signed a 12 month the other day on a towing deal  So it's up to you",

George let's say I have a duck cleaning site but I'm going after tree service I  might not have any other tree services my first tree service site but I'm gonna  show them a duck cleaning site because it just relates they're like oh that  guy's in st. George that lady's in st. George that makes sense right we're  showing these examples so I put that right here preferably in their niche or  in their state and city and then if you guys have a lot of leads coming from  those projects let's say you have a site already built it's generating leads you  can show that if you don't don't worry it's there's not specific things you  need to show you it's just showing them that you've done this before if you have  a really good case study and you can show them hey this business owner has  gotten this many leads show them that okay I noted here if you don't have any  projects you don't have any other sites leverage the group man leverage the  group we have so many case studies combined between all of us in this  program at the time of recording this it's so many case studies so many  websites leverage the group so if you don't have any don't worry about it make  a post search for post and say hey guys does anyone have a concrete project I  can use as a case study use and leverage the group okay number three is I show  social proof okay including screenshots of text messages reviews etc also  sometimes show contracts whatever stripe accounts the proof number one I have  customers number two that people are really making some some money so what I  would recommend is anytime you're communicating with a business owner and  they tell you about some amazing story that they closed a huge monster deal  we've all been on the phone or you will be on the phone where the business owner  says hey you sent me those leads I just closed a $50,000 job what I say in those  situations I'm like hey just so I can use that as kind of a testimony I'm  gonna message you here in just a second after we help with the phone I'm gonna  ask you a question about how things are going if you would just respond don't be  fake about it but if you would just respond and tell me you just what you  just told me on text I can screenshot that and use that as a case study and I  can use that as proof that this works if you wouldn't mind that would help me out  immensely and guys I just have a folder of case studies so for example one of  the ones I use you're gonna see this in the example is I had this lady in Las  Vegas and she sends me a text she's like hey I just closed one of your leads for  like 40 grand so I like to show that example I'm like hey here's one of my  artificial turf clients in Las Vegas she closed the job for 40,000 bucks okay  it's literally proving like hey I showed you the lead value calculator but here  is proof that they're actually that these people are actually closing jobs  okay so I like to show social proof including screenshots screenshots of  text messages reviews etc and then",

We got a little bit of a confusion with the link so  we'll make sure that doesn't happen next week but I want to let you guys know  first and foremost the only thing that we require on this call is that if what  what we do at the end of every one of these calls and this is your first one  is we're going to take all the information that we give you guys and we  are going to put it into a digital resource that looks pretty that's  condensed and then anybody that stays on this call with their camera on till the  end we're gonna take a screenshot and then we're gonna send you guys this  digital resource and the reason why is it because we're like power hungry it's  because we want to make sure that people are paying attention and they're sitting  there or you could be driving too but we want to make sure that you guys are  actually the ones that are are here for the right reason and so in the past  we've had people jump on these lives and all they're they're just here to consume  and take and take and take and so I've said this before but I would rather four  people be on this live I'd rather one person be on this live that really wants  to take action than have a hundred people that do not and so that's all  that we ask keep your camera on we understand you got to be moving maybe  you've got to be doing this or that or the rest that's fine at the end of this  live we will take a screenshot sent in send you that digital resource so then  you don't have to take sit here and take notes on everything that I give you  you can that'll come as a digital resource what I would rather you guys do  is take notes on the things that come to your mind so I'm gonna say things today  that are gonna give you ideas they're gonna remind you to reach out to this  person or oh that person has this business or I should do this those are  the things I want you to take notes on because all the information I'm gonna  share today I am going to be sending you as long as you just stay on this call  and keep your camera on but guys welcome again once again to the call my  goal for well let me just say this first I I I don't believe you guys should  listen or believe anything that I say and that's not like some catchy phrase  whatever but I truly anything that I share with you I want you to ask  yourself why should I listen to this guy and then I want you to go and test it I  don't ever want you just to take my word because if you take my word you're  gonna take the next guy and the next gal and and that's a scary place to be  because 99% of people are full of crap okay all right so um but for those that  don't know me I've been doing this eight years made in 2020 made my first  million dollars doing this and that's not from selling a coaching program  that's literally from building simple websites ranking them on Google and  renting them out and that's that my business was built brick by brick it was  $500 a month thousand dollar a month $500 a month $2,000 a month $2,500  thousand dollar all that first thousand dollar grew to five thousand and it was  literally just brick by brick by brick by brick and the difference between  barely scraping by and getting to a hundred thousand dollars a month in  July of 2020 and never looking back is that I figured out a few key things that  made all the difference in the world and some of you guys on this call have been  thinking about this business model or doing this business model for years or",

    "pageContent": "don't think you need to build more websites I think you  need to be smart about the websites that you build and instead of having a  shotgun approach I want you to have a sniper approach and I want you to know  that when you build a website you have a client and the clients paying for that  website and you can just knock them out and you know you have one in the bag  before you start building the website so again this comes back to why I said this  at the beginning don't just listen to what I'm saying think about it and I  want you to the person that's telling you to build 10 websites I want you to  ask them how much money they're making in this business not from selling their  program not from selling their done-for-you services or their web  hosting or this and that the rest I want you I want you to ask them how much  they're making from doing the actual business before you take their advice  okay because most these people are like the ones in the California gold rush  that sold the picks and the shovels but they don't they're not actually making  money from mining gold so for me I made my first however many million dollars  mining the actual gold and then I saw an opportunity that people would  actually pay for my knowledge because I changed the way this was done and then I  started selling the picks the shovels aka the program so that said guys number  one stick to boring until your bills are paid if your bills are ten thousand  dollars a month go and make sure you're making ten thousand dollars net before  you even think about going into funny niches or you know what you call  obscure niches that's number one okay number two I don't think well this is my  opinion is when in 2020 when I decided and my goal in 2020 is I was like all  right I'm gonna become very focused I'm gonna go into one niche and that was  tree service right that was the only niche I the only niche I dealt with in  2020 in 2020 was tree service now because I had been in these other  programs and I'd build all these these websites that didn't make me money but  that were whatever I had a handful of niches a handful of websites in other  niches so I had a concrete site I had a this side I had a that side I had a  towing site but that's because they were already ranking they were already  getting leads and I was like I'm gonna sell those but I'm gonna focus on tree  service so overwhelmingly most of my I would say 90% of the deals that I did  inside of the year 2020 were in tree service and if it wasn't inside tree  service it was because I already had a website ranking and generating leads  that I built three years before two years before that I probably wouldn't  have even done but I'd been working on it for so long that it was getting leads  so guys if you're new to this pick a niche pick a freaking niche and stick to  it now for those of you that are like oh my gosh concrete saturated yeah you're  gonna start seeing more lead generators than you were two years ago because  we've been talking about concrete for years but you know what's funny is if  you guys aren't following me on YouTube or subscribe to me on YouTube you don't  have to but if you want to we also put out different content and I have this  new series it's gonna be an 8 to 10 part series and I'm literally going me and  Francesca she is going from A to Z on closing a new deal okay A to Z from idea  to deal in the bag to credit card collected and we're gonna do this eight  parts we did part one in fact Aaron or Jason one of you guys go on to YouTube  please get",

Hoog she's just referring to some niches  refrigeration for dairy wineries or distilleries so she's just bringing up  so is this for me to like give my thoughts yeah um I first and foremost  guys let me remind everyone that every niche you can generate leads for no  matter what it is I promise you I've done some really competitive what you  can generate leads for everything everything doing this model but it's  it's varying scales of success so I think about how many boxes does it check  is it is it phone driven if it checks that I go to the next one is it is it  branded if it checks that do I go to the next one or is it unbranded sorry is  it a high ticket and you just start going down the list so I'm gonna like  that one for example I don't know anything about that niche but to me that  sounds like something that's like you it's not mobile right that's something  that's like a brick-and-mortar or am I wrong like that fits more into the HVAC  right okay okay I thought it was like something to actually like these okay  so yeah that would that does sound like it was fit I don't know anything about  that Nick tell me what it's called again what she said it called you said  refrigeration for dairy and wineries and distilleries or so large  refrigeration systems I'm yeah industrial refrigeration um yeah I mean  so I don't love HVAC but this sounds like a sub niche of HVAC it's commercial  refrigeration so it looks like this is saying like I don't even know anything  about this but it's yeah this that could be interesting so um cold storage for  breweries if you're talking about the person that actually goes and fixes or  does the repairs and the maintenance on these type of things that could be very  interesting because that is a sub niche of a much more competitive niche I like  that because it's specific the only thing you could get into is because it's  so neat niche I'm not sure that there's gonna be a ton of companies that are  doing it which means that the one person in town that's doing it might be getting  all the business already but I like that you're taking a niche that is very  competitive HVAC and you're sub niching it's like going to plumbing and going to  what's the one that everyone does like sewage or you know what I'm talking  about right where they go and you know I'm talking about Jason not sewage you  talking about the septic tank pumping septic room is it septic tank removal or  whatever septic septic cleaning I don't know that yeah if it's a if it's a  competitive",

    "pageContent": " All right, guys, let's jump into, I'm gonna get my notes here because I don't want to  miss anything.  Okay, so first and foremost, last week it was interesting and I don't want this to come  across wrong.  I used to be the screaming the mic guy and I realized that was just not me.  Actually it is me sometimes, but not always.  But last week was interesting because I was, you know, I woke up in the morning, I forgot,  I'm in Dubai so I forgot it was that even Labor Day.  It's weird some holidays that you kind of forget when you're traveling.  But I remembered eventually because my brother Porter, if you guys might know him, he's in  the free group.  He's about, he's at like 6,400 bucks a month.  It's his birthday, always on Labor Day.  So I remembered and I started thinking back to like previous Labor Days and I don't remember  any of them, like actually none of them except for one.  And that was in 2017 and I posted about this and I put 18, I think I said six years ago  but it was actually seven.  This is 2017 and this is literally about five weeks after I failed my first business.  I got started into RankinRent, I got a couple deals and then I got shiny penny syndrome  and I thought, man, I think I'm going to start a software company because that sounds cool.  I swear to you, if you think I'm lying, I promise you that when I say that, I literally  just didn't think it sounded cool to tell people I did marketing.  That was one of the main determining factors.  That's how stupid I was as a, how old did I have been, eight years?  I was like 25 and I was still dumb.  I thought it sounded cool to say I had a software company but now I realize it's cool, no matter  what you're doing, to make money because that's what really matters, that's what we're here  for.  Anyway, I had got shiny penny syndrome, I chased this software idea, I failed, I lost  tons of money.  I wasted nine months and it came to this boiling point on, it was either July 27th or July  28th.  I think it was the 28th because that would be, yeah, I think it was the 28th and I'm  in my living room and I'm telling my wife for the fifth, sixth, seventh time, she's  like, so what's going on with the business?  I was so annoyed at this point because nothing, at least for men, I don't know for you ladies  if it's the same, but when my wife would ask me about money, it's like she was questioning  me as a person and my abilities and it was really, really hurtful and she again was like,  so what's going on, give me an update and I didn't have one.  I was like, well, the developer said that we're like two weeks away from beta and he'd  been saying this for like six months.  She finally looked at me and she's like, you know this guy is scamming you, right?  You know that this is not happening.  I knew as she said it that she was right and essentially without going into too much detail,  I paid this guy 60 grand, 50 grand and we'd split it, me and a partner, but then I had  bought him out because I found some stuff out.  So now I was 50, 60 grand in of my own money plus nine months of my time plus the opportunity  cost of not going and doing",

    "pageContent": "door to door sales.  I had no money.  Like I literally had no money and we had bills due at the first of the month and she's like,  she basically was like, it's time for you to start taking care of this family and it  was like one of those like, my goodness, I needed to hear that and it took me a long  time to even be able to say that out loud, but it was very embarrassing.  It was, it killed my confidence, but it was that day that I realized like I have to change  and I have a failed business.  My first one's I'm all for one.  I have to make a change and so I went and did the only thing that I knew how was I was  like, dude, where's that program that I bought like a year ago?  Let me just go start selling something and I started watching the training and I was  like, what's the easiest thing to sell and I was like, I'm going to go sell a couple  of websites.  Let me go sell a couple of websites with SEO and I, so I told my wife, I said, you know,  she's like, I need, you need to call this person, this person, like maybe it's time  you just go get a job and I was like, I can't, like I've talked too much crap.  I'm not going back to my job and which was a door to door salesperson and I'm not going  to get a 95.  So I said, give me till the first of the month, which was three days from that day and I will  have however much we need and we needed $3,000 to basically cover our bills and she's like,  okay, sounds good.  I'll give you three days.  No chance I'm getting it and guys in three days out of desperation and it's funny how  humans are like this when our backs up against the wall, we are so creative.  We are so resourceful and in three days I came up with $3,000 cash, sold three websites  and was able to buy myself another 30 days and then so essentially I used SEO to kind  of get me out of that situation and then I transitioned and I just did it too slow and  I didn't do it correctly.  So whoever it was that said, you know, they're doing SEO, there's nothing wrong with SEO.  There's just a proper way to do it and there's a wrong way to do it and it's very easy to  get stuck in the wrong way and to chase the money only to end up in a year with nothing,  with no assets, with nothing that you can tie the clients to.  So anyway, the reason I'm telling this whole story, five weeks after this because that  would have been, you know, September, beginning of September, I just remember on Labor Day,  I'd been working my butt off like truly, truly, truly I'd been working my butt off and I made  good money.  I made $3,000 in three days and I made 10,000 bucks my very first month going all in on  SEO and that was cash collected because I needed to.  I had kids, I had bills, all this stuff and Labor Day, I remember it was Sunday night  going into Monday and I thought to myself, like, I want to spend time with my kids.  I was at my parents' house and I was like, I want to go to the parade and, you know,  like spend some time with them because I haven't spent much time but I was like, I need to  like, I got stuff to do and I just remember I woke up, I needed to write 3,000 words of",

    "pageContent": " content.  Yes, I used to write my own content.  I wrote my first 300,000 words of content just for the record and I woke up at 4 a.m.  And I sat in my parents' kitchen with it completely quiet and I picked away the keyboard  and I wrote 3,000 words of content before I went to the gym and I showered and went  to the parade.  And I remember that because I was so tired, of course, because I woke up at 4 a.m., but  I was so excited to be making money.  I was so, it was so refreshing to know that like even if it was a thousand bucks, it was  my money.  It wasn't, it wasn't relying on somebody else and I was actually making money and it was  so exciting.  So, I had that whole, whatever, I made a post about it and then I got on the call and I,  you know, I was going to share this training and there was two people on.  And again, guys, you don't have to work on Labor Day.  Some of you guys aren't in that, most of you guys hopefully aren't in that situation but  I think that the rhetorical question I wanted to ask was like, you know, if you're not where  you want to be, should you be taking Labor Day off?  Like if you're not where you want to be, should you be, you know, taking off the Friday, whatever?  And so, I guess rhetorically, I want you guys just to be thinking about this as like either  stop complaining about where you're at or do something about it.  And my dad always used to say this quote to me, if you always do what you've always done,  you always get what you've always got.  And I know it's stupid, it's cliche, and I've heard it a million different times, a million  different ways, but it's so freaking true.  I do the same thing.  We sit and we do the same thing again and again.  We keep coming on these lives.  We keep getting our pencil and our paper and we keep saying, well, I'm going to start that  business but we keep coming up with a reason why we're not going to do it today.  You know, well, we're going to do it once so-and-so graduates.  We're going to do it once, you know, we finish the backyard.  We're going to do it when my job slows down.  You have no idea how many people have almost started this business, have almost done it  and then something happens and they don't.  And I just had a friend recently, he's been telling me over and over, I'm so bored at  my job.  Like, whatever, I don't, it's not, I can make so much more money complaining, complaining,  every single time I see him and I'm like, dude, do this.  And he's like, okay, let me move some money around, let me get into your program, whatever.  He pulls money out of his 401k.  He does the whole deal.  And when it comes down to it, I message him and he's like, it should be deposited on Wednesday.  I'm like, so like, are you joining or like, what's the deal?  He's like, he sent me this long text, something came up and I got to just spend some time  on this person.  And again, it's my friend, but and I didn't say a word back to him because it's my friend  and I just said, hope everything's good, man.  And good luck.  You know, I'm not going",

So rhetorically, I think about this to myself, like I complain that I'm not in a million  dollars a month.  I don't complain, but I said, why am I not a million dollars a month?  And then I'm doing the same stupid stuff that I was doing when I like that I've been doing  and if nothing's going to change and I'm still staying up, like I'll tell you guys, I'll  be honest with you guys.  Last night, you know, my most productive, when I go to bed early on Sunday and I plan  my son on Sunday for my week and I go to bed early, I wake up and I get so much done.  Like I start Monday so strong.  And yesterday I slept in, I didn't plan and I pushed it.  I'll do it later.  I'm going to get some food.  I didn't plan until this morning.  I did plan.  It's not till this morning.  And because of that, I didn't have any momentum.  So last night somebody sent something to me and all of a sudden I'm on x.com on just looking  at these threads.  I didn't go to bed till 3 a.m. last night.  That's so bad.  It's so embarrassing.  And I'm telling you guys because number one, I'm not going to lie to you.  Number two, I do the same stupid stuff you guys do.  And number three, it's like, how can I expect to be at a million dollars a month if I'm  still spending two hours of time that I can't get back?  So painful to say on stupid x.com on meaningless threads that I could have read.  I could have written a book or started a book.  I could have made posts.  I could read content.  I could have slept.  I could have called.  I mean, it was so dumb.  So again, guys, I just wanted you guys to understand it and maybe just to like relay  or to share my frustration.  And what I'm thinking about is if you're not where you want to be, are you doing anything  different than you've been doing?  And if not, then how do you expect anything to change?  It's actually, it's asinine.  Nothing's going to change.  So that's just a little quick thought.  And with that said, guys, I want to get into what we're going to share today.  Now, again, Jason, if you see comments that are pertinent, cut me off.  Aaron, if you need to cut me off, let me know as well.  And then at the end, we're going to do Q&A.  Okay?  How's it going so far, guys?  Going great.  I think it's going pretty good.  Beautiful.  Okay.  So when do you pull the plug on the city?  That's what we're going to talk about today.  My goal, by the way, is that with this specific call, is that by the end of this live, you're  going to have an understanding of my specific criteria for when it's time to pull out of  a city and niche.  But you have to remember that you're only going to perfect this through repetition,  by doing.  And so you can read about it.  You can listen to hundreds of hours of stuff.  But until you go in to an area and you lose some money on ads and you feel what it's like  to see that money going out the door and, oh my gosh, I might get zero",

    "pageContent": "return.  Should I pull?  Until you've done that a ton of times, you're not going to be able to perfect this.  And that's just kind of the reality.  So that is my goal with this live, guys, is to have you guys know this criteria doesn't  mean that you have to believe it.  And I don't want you to believe anything that I say without testing it, okay?  So here's the plan, kind of the outline I want to talk about.  Number one is I'm going to talk about how picking the right city and niche is the key.  We're going to be talking about, you know, deciding when to actually pull out is an art,  not a science.  We're going to be talking about if you are actually generating leads, there's always  a deal to be had.  We're going to talk about the fact that you don't lose money until you quit.  We're going to be talking about my criteria for winning areas put on the chopping block  and then my motto in life, but especially in business, okay?  So that said, let's get into it.  Number one, man, I always use like the number 17 or I don't know, something about seven,  I always use some random number for the number of times I've said something.  But guys, I have said this so many times.  The key to every part of this business, the make or break with this business is picking  the right city and niche combo.  If you do not, if you do not pick the right city niche combo, I don't care how good you  are at SEO, I don't care how good you are at ads, I don't care how good you are at sales,  I don't care how quick you can transfer leads, everything is harder.  On the other hand, if you get that right, if you get into a juicy freaking right, low  hanging fruit, you can do almost everything wrong and still win and it feels light and  it feels exciting and it feels, I don't say easy, but it doesn't feel heavy.  And it's like it's motivating because it happened and you did it quickly.  So I just want to stress guys that if you guys are, if you guys do not have the criteria  and you are not confident in what that looks like, you are going to be spinning your wheels  because you're going to, it's going to be hard for you to pull out of a city because  you're going to go, I don't know if that was the right city, maybe I just picked the wrong  city.  But if you know you're in the right city, then you're like, I know this is right because  of this, this, this and this.  It's like these other ones that I was in.  So obviously it's got to be my ads or my landing page or the way that I'm handling these leads  or my cold calling.  But it's so frustrating when you don't know if it's the right city, if you're not getting  leads or you're not having any success to know what the heck is freaking going on.  So really quick, what I want to ask, I'm going to have Jason, this is completely, I didn't  tell you I was going to ask this, but do you want to speak on that a little bit?  Tell these, I mean, maybe, maybe I'm completely in my own field here, but have you seen that  to be true?  Have you seen that, you know, certain areas it's like, dude, I could do a hundred of these  tomorrow and other areas, everything you do, it seems like you just can't move, you know,  can't move",

Don't, what is it, what's the, what they say in the South, if it ain't broke, don't fix  it.  I've heard that about a thousand times over the course of my door-to-door sales days and  it is so freaking true.  Okay, now next question.  How do I get the perfect framework?  Well, you can go develop your own or you can pay to get mine.  It's really easy.  Okay.  There's one that, there's 1.8 thousand YouTube videos you could go watch.  And how many live?  Aaron, how many lives do you think we've done inside the free group before we stopped doing  them in the free group?  It was like a solid three years straight.  So like every week, I think I missed two and I was, I was literally in a jungle in Africa  and physically couldn't get on and I didn't plan well.  Uh, there, there's probably a hundred, there's gotta be 150 of those things, right?  Cause I did it.  Yeah.  Three, like now maybe like 125, 130, 130 times, there's 130 times an hour and 15 minutes  I mean, do the math.  Plus all the posts.  So you either pay with your time or you pay with your money.  That's it.  There's no, you pay the piper.  That's how you get the perfect formula.  So I have it.  You want to buy it.  If you don't, you can go through all the material.  If you think that I know what I'm talking about.  Okay.  That's really simple.  Um, the other option is you go and just do what I did, but you guys have to remember,  even though I did all that I did, I spent four hours, four years, sorry, developing  and trying and testing the perfect due diligence formula.  What I think people forget is I also paid, I bought over $23,000 in programs on top of  the four years, four years.  So the fact that some people like, I'm just going to go, I'm just going to go, I'm at  the perfect formula.  That's like thinking that you're going to be like some of these investing companies  that look at a 500 deals a week and know exactly what metrics and exactly what the market should  look like and exactly, um, what the, uh, what the cap rate needs to be, the minimum cap  rate and the growth of the city and thinking that you're even going to play ball.  Absolutely not.  Okay.  So anyway, I just have to stress to you the importance of picking the right city in the  niche.  Cause you guys, I'm going to tell you all this stuff, but if you're in the wrong city,  it doesn't matter what you do.  You're screwed.  Okay.  So that's all I want to say.  Um, also I want to give you a little pro tip and I know I've talked about this before,  but I saw some of you guys said you were new, uh, in the comments.  If you aren't looking at CPC, which for the brand, brand, brand new people, that is the  cost per click, the cost that it costs you to go to Google and say, put me on page one  and I'll pay every time someone clicks on my ad instead of waiting for him to rank.  If you're not looking at the cost, the CPC",

    "pageContent": "guys, if you're not factoring that into your  decision of going into an area, that's your business.  Okay.  I've never been advised this from any other course and I've bought a lot.  I've been, I'm in all of them, all the ones that you guys have heard of.  I bought them all.  I'm in, I'm in friends with most of them.  Um, the ones I'm not, they don't like me.  That's fine.  But if you're not looking at CPC, then that's your business, but you should be.  Okay.  Even if you're not going to run ads, you should be looking at CPC and I don't have time to  explain all that, but that is just a pro tip.  Okay.  Next, this is an art, not a science.  Okay.  I, I've tried to make this as scientific as possible.  I've tried my best with, you know, okay, when do we pull out of an area?  Because guys, when I, in 2020, when we went from eight to $10,000 up to a hundred thousand  dollars a month in an eight month window, we were running campaigns.  We were spending money on ads.  We were hustling and bustling and shuffling and we had how many in the queue and how many  getting set up and we, I knew to the second, it was like, I think it was like four minutes  and 32 seconds or five minutes and 32 seconds.  I could set up an ad and it was exactly the same copy and paste the keyword.  I knew exactly what I was doing to, to a freaking team.  And even then, even then I was always surprised here and there, even knowing every single  factor that I did.  I want you guys to understand that this is an art, not a science.  Okay.  When you spend X amount, then you pull out.  But the problem is, is it's like, well, maybe you spent X amount of dollars on ads in the  wrong city or in the right city, but the wrong time of year, or in the wrong right city and  the right time of year, but you didn't do the right ad, like there's so many factors  that you just have to understand.  This is an art, not a science and instead of being frustrated by that, I think you should  be excited by that because this is how I always think about things that are hard or that take  time and effort and thought and creativity and whatever.  Like when Google comes out with a GMB update, everyone's like, oh my gosh, I get excited  about it.  And I don't want to try and, I don't want this to sound like I'm regurgitating information  that people are saying online, but if you really think about it, if it's hard, it's  just pushing people away that aren't willing to go through it.  And so the fact that this is an art and a lot of this business is an art, there's a  reason we call the Facebook group the art of digital real estate.  And we call it the art of pre-selling is because no one wants an art.  Everyone wants to have an exact, perfect, when this happens, then do this.  Guys, that's just not life.  And if you need those answers and you want to live a life that's like, if this happens  then you're more going to be more comfortable, more secure in a nine to five type of a setting.  And I don't mean that in any disrespectful way because that's okay.  But this might not be for you.  This is an art, not a science.",

    "pageContent": " And it's just like with stock market, guys, there's no exact science for how long you  should stay in a stock.  Guys, I invested in 2014.  I worked the entire summer door to door sales, sweat buckets of sweat, got rejected thousands  of times, all kinds of different stuff, lost sleep, got in fights with my wife because  of this, that and the rest and how tired I was, whatever, right?  Missed time with my kids, spent that entire summer doing door to door sales.  And Jason did some of that as well.  So he knows my pain.  Some of you guys might have as well.  And I made that year, I think it was $130,000, okay, basically.  That's gross.  And I think I probably put like one 10 in my pocket.  Didn't have a ton of expenses, but I did have some.  And I spent of that, I spent, I put 40 or 50, I think it was 50, no, it was 50, not  40.  $50,000.  So I lived on part of it.  Keep in mind, I lived on part of it.  And then I spent the majority of the money I had left and I put it on a stock, on one  stock that was going to IPO.  And it was the company I worked for, Vivint, it's called Vivint Solar.  And Vivint Solar, just before that, Alibaba had, if you guys are familiar with that, it's  like the Chinese Amazon, they had gone public.  And literally, I don't know, their stock like 13X or something.  And I started doing the math.  I was like, yo, if I put in 10,000 bucks in this team, 13Xs.  And if it does half of that, then that six, how can I lose?  And to be fair, our bosses, our regional managers, they were telling all of us, get all the money  you can get, put your entire back end of check into this company.  If you got to go to your dad and borrow money.  Anyway, I put $50,000 in the stock and this thing, I put it in and not only did it not  go up, it literally the day after it was down, it would have been better for me to buy in  at the regular price.  And for the entire time, guys, that I was in the stock, I was losing the money.  But the crappy part is, I didn't know when to pull out.  I didn't know if I should keep it in, whatever.  And I pulled out, this is so, it's embarrassing.  I pulled out at the beginning of 2020 and it was, instead of being worth 50,000, which  it had gone down to being worth about 10, it had bumped up to like 25.  So I swelled up a bit and I was like, dude, I'm going to take half my money and just get  out of this thing.  And I did.  I cashed out and I promised you guys like two months later, that thing was not only  worth what I originally bought in, but it was worth like 50% more.  If I would have waited two more months, I waited six years.  And if I would have waited six years and two months, I would have made money, like enough  that it would have been worth my money being in there the entire time, okay?  My point being, that's an art.  This is an art.  Some of the best things in life are art.  Life is art.  And you just got to get",

    "pageContent": "comfortable with that, okay?  All right.  Number three thing I want to say, if you guys are generating leads in an area, if you have  a website that's organically getting leads from the GMB, from the organic rankings, from  whatever it is, if you are getting leads, there is always a deal to be made.  If you're running ads and that ad campaign and that landing page is producing consistent  leads, there is always a deal to be had.  And in the same way that my stock, with my stock example, you do not lose money until  you pull out.  You do not lose money until you quit.  And what I mean by that is, let's say in a hypothetical situation that Aaron goes and  sets up a campaign for minneapolisconcrete.com.  And Aaron, he spends 150 bucks, right?  And he has no business owner.  He's gotten some leads.  He's hooked a couple of business owners.  He's tried to get on the Zoom with two of them.  He's 0 for 2.  Or maybe he's only, he's 0 for 1.  If Aaron quits and he's like, dude, this doesn't work, Nick's full of crap, digital real estate  is a baloney, I'm going to do drop shipping, I'm going to do freaking e-com, whatever,  I'm going to go to my 95, that's fine.  That is the only way that Aaron could lose money.  Because Aaron, let's say he's at $250 spent, he has no deal.  But he's like, dude, I'm going to double down.  This area is producing leads.  I know I'm going to get a business owner.  I just got to get creative.  I just got, it's just that next one.  And he spends $500.  He doubles his spend, okay?  But on the last person, he gets the deal.  It's $1,500 a month or even $1,000 a month.  He gets the deal, signs a six-month contract.  Guess what?  Every single dollar that he spent to get to that deal, he recouped instantly.  And he's positive.  And that doesn't mean he had to stay in Minneapolis.  That could mean he was in Minneapolis.  He determined, yes, indeed, this is too competitive.  I didn't listen to Nick.  The CPC was too high.  I'm going to shift to a smaller city in Minnesota or I'm going to shift states because this  isn't a great state.  I'm going to go to Tampa and I'm going to set it up.  And he spends $250 in Tampa.  As long as he doesn't decide to quit and he keeps doing it until he gets that first deal,  he doesn't lose his money.  Okay?  And the way I view it, guys, is you're spending money that you're spending the customer's  money.  Right?  Every time I turn on ads, I'm spending my customer that's about to sign with me is the  way I do it.  Why?  Because I'm not stopping until I get a deal.  Guys, I'll spend $1,000.  I'll go 0 for 20 because I know eventually I'm going to get a deal.  And even if I spend, by the way, I don't think I've ever spent $1,000.  I think the most I've ever spent is a couple hundred.  But I'm just using an extreme example.  I'll spend $1,000 because I know that even if I do get the deal, month one, I break even  and now I'm",

So you guys have to remember that you get in and you start putting a little bit of money  on a credit card and you're like, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, I'm losing money.  No, you don't lose money until you quit.  Okay?  You don't lose money until you walk away.  Just like I wouldn't have lost that money until I pulled out.  If I would have waited until it, hey, just fix your head, dude.  It's got to come back up or you're leaving it in.  I would have made money.  Okay?  So that's the deal.  Okay.  So now we're going to get into the juicy stuff.  We're going to talk about my criteria for winning areas, put on the chopping block.  But what I'm going to do really, really quick, Jason, do we have any comments?  We don't have any comments yet.  Nope.  Okay.  So what I'm going to do, just one, give me, I just have to plug my computer in.  I'm at a nice 2%.  Hold on.  It's going to kick off one of my lights.  My bad.  Hold on.  Just a thought on why Nick has been saying this.  What he's saying is it's so important to actually find the right business owner.  So he's willing to spend extra money to find the right business owner and not just take  the first person who's going to pay him.  Very good point.  Very good point.  Just because you can get money, just because someone's willing to give you money doesn't  mean you should take it.  And I say this, this is just like, just because something's free doesn't mean you should accept  it.  Specifically inside the free group, when I see people, we try to get rid of all the clowns,  but like I see people like, oh, I have this genius landing page.  DM me.  It's like, bro, do you even make money?  And I call these people out.  I don't know.  Was it Aaron?  Were you on that thread with that kid that was like going ballistic on me because I called  him out on the group?  Was that you or that Kyle?  Must have been Kyle.  Okay.  Anyway, some kid, he did something like that and I called him out publicly and then he's  like, you're being a dick.  I'm like, don't come in my group.  Says right there.  Don't be a dick.  Anyway, let's talk about my criteria for when I put an area on the chopping block.  Again, guys, this is me.  This is my criteria.  What do I know?  Well, I know that real quick.  I know how to make.  Sorry, bro.  I was just going to say real quick, the audio is fine, but the video is really lagging choppy.  Just on a side note, you know, you know what, I don't know if that's what I think it is.  I think it's what I'm charging.  I just kind of said again, pretty rough.  How's the audio now?  What if I just turn the camera off for a second?  How's the audio?  Fine.  Yeah, it's fine.  You know, I think it's I think it's when I plug in my computer to charge it at the same  time.  We're just going to go with the camera off for a second.  Everyone can hear me.  OK, so, yeah, my computer is at two percent.  Otherwise,",

I'm going to start a fire in my in my apartment.  So guys, let's talk about my criteria.  What I was about to say, though, is I was saying, you know, these are my criteria.  What do I know?  And I was going to say, I know how to make a million dollars a year doing this.  So that could be important.  So here's my criteria.  I've got a couple criteria, but I think you guys are going to be a little bit surprised  by this.  OK, so and again, we didn't even announce this at the beginning.  But what we're going to do is, well, I think we've already created this, Aaron.  I don't know if you've included this in it, but typically what we do on these calls is  if you stay till the end with your camera on, we're going to screenshot everybody here  And we're going to send you the digital resource that we've created from this training.  So but just in case this wasn't put, I would I would write these things down.  OK, I just create that link, a Google Drive link.  So I'll drop it in the comments at the end of the column.  People can just download the PDF.  That's amazing. That's amazing.  And also, I think what we are going to do, too, is anyone that stays on, we were going  to do the the we were going to give them the early access to the next podcast episode,  which is going to is going to drop on Thursday.  So Aaron, if you want to grab that Vimeo link, make it unlisted.  We can drop that at the end as well.  Sounds good.  So if you guys stay till the end, I don't even know what how many of you have on 10,  15, 5, I see 21, including us.  How many?  21, including us.  Beautiful. OK, so there's 18 people, basically.  You guys stay to the end.  We're going to give you guys the digital resource and early access, three days early  access to the latest podcast, which what was the name of the latest podcast we did?  It was the oh, the perfectly the the the perfectly broken business model.  I think it was titles like that.  It's just recorded like two days ago.  So, guys, here's my criteria.  These are things I would consider writing down.  And this is when when these things happen, this puts the area on a chopping block for me.  OK, number one is I have spent at least one hundred and fifty to two hundred dollars on ads.  I've made adjustments to the ads.  And or the landing page, and I'm still not generating leads.  So I go, I spend 50 bucks, I got nothing, I'm still going.  I spent 100 bucks, I got nothing, I'm still going.  Even if I spent 150 bucks, if I see that there's a lot of impressions and whatever,  and it just looks like there's going to be there should be, you know,  like logically, there should be leads in that area.  I know there's volume.  So there's something that's off.  Well, you know, I'm going to keep going.  OK, so if I'm not getting leads and I've spent that kind of money.  And guys, remember.  This is like a totally separate training, but just be logic, be use your",

But if you're getting impressions and you're not getting clicks, your ads either suck  or they're getting shown to the wrong people because no one's clicking on them.  If you're getting clicks, that means you're spending money, but nobody's calling.  You're not getting leads.  That means you're getting clicks from the wrong people, the wrong traffic or your landing page sucks.  And I want to say this because for me, when I say I'll spend 150 to 200 dollars,  I know that my landing page is going to convert because I've just tested it so many times.  I've spent over a million dollars testing it.  I know that it's going to convert.  I know what to what my audience looks like.  So it's very rare for me.  And I also know I've chosen the right area because I know how to choose an area  because I've done it so many times wrong.  But if I spend 150 to 200 bucks and I'm not getting leads, something ain't right.  OK, that's a situation where I would move to a new area.  OK, I ain't quitting. I'm not stopping.  I'm going to keep going, but I'm going to choose a new area.  Maybe I choose a different city that's near there, you know, that kind of thing.  Let's say I'm targeting Vegas or let's say I'm targeting Henderson, Nevada.  That might be a situation where I'm like, all right, I didn't want to target Vegas,  but maybe I need to target Vegas because Henderson's not producing any leads type of a situation.  But 150 to 200 dollars, I've made adjustments to my ads and I'm still not getting leads.  That thing's going on the chopping block and it's getting ready to get plugged.  They're getting ready to get pulled. OK.  OK, that's number one.  Let's see. Number two.  OK, that's it. That's it. That's basically my rule.  These other things, I'm going to go over them.  But like this is what this is the notes that I have outside of that, guys,  outside of me spending 150 to 200 dollars on ads and, you know,  tweaking the leads or tweaking the ads, you know, whatever.  I know I've got the right city because I know my process.  Unless that happens.  I am going to get a deal.  I like I just know and that was one of the things I said at the beginning.  If you are getting leads, there's always a deal to be had.  You might have to, you know, get creative.  You might have to go find somebody on a Facebook Facebook group.  You might have to go find somebody in a neighboring town.  You might have to go find somebody in a different business,  but that also does that service.  OK, you might have to make a post on Facebook and make a post on your story.  There is always a deal. If there are leads coming in,  there is always a deal to be had.  So for me, I ain't pulling out of no area because I can't get a deal.  If there's leads coming in, I am going to go there.  OK, now there is a small caveat because I know sometimes you do something,  you do something, you do something, and it's just like, gosh, dang it.  I need to just take a break.  I'm not if I'm getting leads, that area is mine.  I'm not giving up on it.  There have",

    "pageContent": "been occasions where I'm like, all right,  I feel like I pitched everybody.  I need a new set of eyeballs on this.  Let me go ahead and pause this campaign.  I'll set up another one in a neighboring city  or turn on one of my other ones because I've already got one ready.  I'll go and run that, get a deal, and I'll come back to that first one.  OK, maybe I'll wait for a different time of the year.  Maybe I'll wait for, you know, the election to finish or some big news  or tax, but I am not giving up on the area.  I am getting leads in an area with ads, with organic.  I'm going to get a deal.  And that's just the mentality that I have.  So there is there is one rule that I have, and that is that if I've spent  one hundred fifty to two hundred dollars and I know that I'm in the right city,  I have my landing page is good and I'm not getting leads.  Something ain't right.  OK, and and that's the only time I'm pulling out. Period.  OK, so the truth is, guys, is that  if it's if if I'm getting leads, there is always a deal to be had. OK.  That that's it. And if not, guys, if I'm getting no clicks  and only impressions, like I told you guys, if you're only getting impressions,  it's probably getting shown to the wrong people or your ads suck.  And if you're getting clicks, but no leads, then you're probably getting  the wrong people clicking on it or your your landing page sucks.  And you just need to start making adjustments. OK, that's it.  So, guys, like for me, if you find the mentality, there is always a deal.  I will always get a deal.  There was one of my first projects.  In fact, my very first one was towing huntsville.com.  I've since sold the website.  I got a deal. I got it's like 700 bucks a month.  And it was like two, three months. They paid me.  They wanted to pay me in a check.  I didn't really know how to do stripe, whatever.  And it was kind of cool to get a check instead of a stripe.  I liked getting them in the mail, which was stupid.  But that's just how it was.  I didn't want to spend three percent.  All that stuff. Two point nine seven or whatever.  Client cancels.  And I had to find somebody else.  And I did find somebody else for a minute.  And then I couldn't after that, I could not for the life of me find someone.  Guys, I went through every single business owner.  I was given every I could.  It's like I couldn't give away leads fast enough.  I was trying everybody and anybody.  And I almost just gave up on this thing.  I was like, dude, I'm getting leads.  Why? Why is no one taking these?  You know, this area just must not be good.  And finally, I I was in this cash crunch and a friend of mine offered.  He's like, do you have any websites you want to sell?  I was like, well, I have this one that's producing a bunch of leads.  He's like, yeah, but if you don't have a client, it's not really valuable to me.  And I was like, yeah, he's right.  So I just I remember it was December of 2019.  The same December of 2019 that I decided to",

I was if there was a name and a phone number,  I didn't even I didn't even need to know the company name.  And I saw this one comment.  I remember it was a December day.  It was so bloody cold outside, because I just went for a run.  I came inside and I called this number.  And I didn't know the company name, and I just pitched them.  And I ended up frickin closing this guy for 500 bucks a month.  Put him in a six month contract.  And I flipped the site and sold it for nine thousand bucks to a friend of mine,  which, by the way, he's made way more than that.  So it was a win win for everybody.  But the point is, there is always a deal to be had.  OK, if I'm getting leads and I'm not hooking business owners, that's on me.  If you're getting leads and you're not hooking business owners  or closing business owners, that's on you.  If I'm getting leads and hooking business owners, but I'm not closing,  that's on me. OK.  And guys, to just wrap up on that point.  My motto is always either yes.  Or not now, maybe later.  OK, I don't let people tell me no.  Yes, or not now, maybe later.  We've done an entire training on this inside digital landlords.  But if I go if I if I cold call somebody.  I do not let them tell me no.  I have a way that I can I can leave that door open.  I never close doors. I never slam doors.  I never burn bridges. I try my best not to, at least,  because I know that this is a long game.  And guys, if you guys are in this to make legit real money,  do not get knows, do not burn bridges, do not freaking blaze through areas.  Because the people that tell, you know, today  that are going through something tragic or in the middle of a divorce  or in a financial in three years, those same people will surprise you.  They're in a completely different situation,  maybe in a completely different business, and they will buy leads from you.  And I've had this happen not once, not twice, but probably five different times  where today I almost had the deal.  They were interested and they said no, or they they weren't interested today.  And I said, OK, let's talk down the road.  And I followed up three years later or they saw my post  or they reached out to me and said, hey, can I get some leads?  And I got the freaking deal.  So my motto in life in general is I don't I don't take knows, man.  I don't I never take those.  I leave every single door open  because it's either yes or not now, maybe later.  And that's that's the truth.  So, guys, my my criteria for the chopping block.  Is basically unless unless I've spent 150 to 200 bucks,  made some adjustments on ads  and I'm not getting leads and I am getting clicks.  Then I'm I'm in that area.  And why why can I be this confident?  Because I know what a good area looks like.  I know what what it needs to look like.  I know what kind of search volume needs to have.  I know what the CPC needs to be.",

    "pageContent": " I know those things, and that gives me the confidence  to stay in an area until I get a deal.  OK, Jason, let's go through at nine minutes.  Do we have any questions, any comments?  If not, we'll wrap it up.  Yeah, Kirk was just agreeing with the business owners.  He said he's one thousand dollars.  Looks like he's one thousand euros in on ads  for business owners, and he's still in it.  So he says spot on with the business owners.  I didn't validate mine and lost money on all of them.  Be good. He says it would be good to get tips  on validating the business owners.  So Kirk, maybe mean you can just jump on a call, man,  and I can just show you some tips on that.  So just reach out to Donnie Dre after this call.  That's a good idea.  And Kirk, you're crazy if you don't take him up on that.  By the way, I appreciate you doing that.  Yeah, that's so just real quick tips on that.  I'd need more context, but don't be afraid  to do a pullback on the initial call.  That's my tip.  I think sometimes we get in, we want to get some free leads.  If I'll give you some free leads, we'll do a call.  And we're so excited that they didn't like yell at us  and we're so excited, they're showing a little bit of interest.  We're like that person in high school that never went on a date.  And then the first person out, they like go bananas  because they show him some attention.  It's pathetic. OK, don't don't do that.  Like at the end of the call, if you're unsure, say that say,  Mr. Business Owner, real quick, I'll give you some free leads.  Like, shoot me straight, man.  Are you just looking for free leads?  Because if you're just looking for free leads, like, let me know.  I'll give you a free or you want to grow your company.  Like, are you going to answer my call when I call you?  Are you going to?  Because I'm trying to I'm trying to run a business here.  I'm going to let you try this for free.  There's no absolutely no strings attached yet.  But I am here to earn your business.  And if you're not interested in talking  and you're just telling me what I want to hear, dude, I'm a big boy.  I'm a big girl. Just tell me right now.  And that terrifies some of you to say that.  But guys, say it, because if they're interested, they're going to go,  no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I'm super interested.  Sorry, I'm busy.  Or if they're not, you're going to give them an opportunity to just  freaking walk away and go call somebody else, because that's as Jason said.  The right business owner is so important.  And you guys are going to it's going to happen to you.  You're going to get business owners that give you their money today.  And they're just not the right fit.  And you want to get that money.  You want to take it so bad.  But it's not the right decision, because if you get that deal today,  you're locked in a six month contract with somebody  who's not going to be with you in a year.  And then in six months, you're going to have to get somebody new.  And that might be the time.  It's like",

    "pageContent": "winter.  And you have to make these big boy, big girl decisions of  even though I can take money today, it's not the right money.  It's not the long term money.  It's not the big money.  And that's a hard, mature thing that you have to you have to learn.  OK, so anything else?  Um, John Fahm, he shared one of his areas with the CBC.  And then, yeah, so I just recommended that, you know,  if you do find a good area,  I would encourage you to kind of keep it to yourself also,  especially with like sharing it with people publicly.  It's a Jamesville, Wisconsin.  Does he say what what niche concrete?  Yeah, beautiful.  I'm going to text my team right now and get it.  No, I'm just kidding, bro.  But he says he doesn't really mind.  But to be honest, like, I like to keep my areas to myself  just because that area has potential making you money.  So personally, I like to keep my areas to myself.  I don't share with people because people jump on that and try and take it.  A lot of people are lazy about doing their their due diligence.  So just be aware of that.  Yeah, I know that.  I would just pop in real quick.  You said concrete in Wisconsin.  Just the thought that might not be great  because I think it gets pretty cold in Wisconsin.  And so if you are to go there, you might just possibly want to plan  on it being more of a nine months, a year deal,  assuming that concrete business is like practically shut down  during the winter month period.  You can I mean, still, like if you have a deal going like six  to nine months out of the year, that's awesome.  Obviously, even if it's only a thousand bucks a month, I'm just  that's just a thought as well.  It's a good point.  And I think there's a way you could do it for the year,  but you just need to go in with the right intention.  And what I would do, I'd still do a 12 month deal,  but I'd just pitch it really hard.  Like, hey, this is a year thing.  Like, I only sell a year contract.  It is going to be really slow during the year during December.  So I can either do one of two things  and you can make the one thing seem way better than the others.  I can either pause you for three months and charge you, you know,  fifteen hundred bucks a month for the other nine months.  Or we could just do a thousand bucks a month and you pay year round.  And there's a couple of months you're going to be shut down.  So now they have a perceived savings of a couple of thousand bucks.  They stay with you year round.  You've let them know up front that that's going to happen  and that is going to happen.  And they're just going to be somebody else.  So very important point.  Doesn't mean you can't go into these states, guys.  Doesn't mean you can't go to these areas.  But if you can, I would keep looking, looking to something that's,  you know, Wisconsin's probably good for something that's not that's not concrete.  But again, this comes from experience and nothing sucks more.  And as soon as it starts to get cold, people start calling you, hey, bro,  let's go ahead and pause this bad boy.  And you're like, dude, I can't pause.  Well, OK, I'm sorry.  So good",

That's just a link to the Google Drive that's housing the PDF  for the cheat sheet for today's live.  And for those of you that are still on, let me put in the Vimeo link  for early access to these podcasts.  So that's kind of cool.  I've never been part of a when people leave review.  Can we see the name of the person that left a review on the podcast?  It depends on what I think you can only leave reviews on Spotify,  but I'm not too sure.  Well, I'll just let you guys know reviews help.  We appreciate it.  If you guys do leave a review, send me a screenshot posted in the group.  I'll try to hook you guys up with some swag on the next live.  Because those things mean a lot to us.  That's only if you like the podcast and you've actually listened.  I don't want you lying.  I don't want you saying it's good if you don't think it's good.  But we really, really appreciate that.  But yeah, that podcast, that that the one you just shared.  Do you guys go to Spotify or Apple type in digital realistic secrets?  That one is not out and it's not going to be released until Thursday  7 a.m. or 5 a.m. or something like that.  Awesome. Yeah, I just I'm editing.  I put in it was from last week's.  Let me put in the other link.  There we go. It's been edited now.  So you can just save that. That's kind of cool.  And get going with that one.  Yeah, it's why the rank and rent digital real estate model is broken.  Not sure where you're going with that, Nick.  But I will definitely give it a listen.  Yeah, it's it's click bait.  But I follow. I actually come through on the click bait for real.  It makes sense when you listen to it.  So any other questions?  So Kirk just says he has a not now.  Pause the ads was thinking of finding a new bio.  He's asking if you should do that, Kirk.  Yeah, go find a new business owner.  You know, if somebody asks you for a lead, you say not now.  Do you think they want to continue work with you down the road?  Probably not. Yeah, so I agree.  And not now.  Again, I've talked about this.  I've trained about this in digital landlords, guys.  We it's we think that it's like we go to a city and it's yes or no.  Right. It's not.  It's yes or not now, maybe later.  And I view it like an entire city like that.  So if I'm looking, if I'm working Las Vegas, I'm working Los Angeles,  which would be terrible to work.  But I'm going to use that in Phoenix. Right.  I might be working those areas and I might find out that like,  you know, dude,  Las Vegas right now, it's just it's a it's a weird time of year.  And I'm just not getting any traction.  And so I'm not going to quit on the area because I've done all the homework.  I know that's a good area.  But I am going to pause it and go look at other stuff  and maybe try to get a deal in L.A., try to get a deal in Phoenix.  Then I'll come back",

Nadine says, Nick, I sent a guy leads this morning.  He seems keen. When do I follow up?  Nadine, are you is she in does that name?  Is she in digital landlords or she not?  I can check. It doesn't sound familiar.  You know.  It does sound familiar.  Nadine, are you in digital landlords?  Because if you are, I'm going to just refer you to a module  which will answer every single one of your questions in two seconds.  Well, we'll see what you answer.  Let's see another. Well, I get that.  Yeah, I don't know if you want to answer for the group still.  Just a quick synopsis summary.  So Nadine's not in deal.  Oh, OK. So just in the free group, then.  So a little summary, Nick.  Yeah, you want to, you're saying?  Yeah, you got it. You want to do that?  Yeah, you do it for the group.  Yeah, this would be the last thing that I'll answer, guys, is.  So it's again, it's an art.  It's it's first of all, when you say follow up, this is this is tough, right?  Like we're not talking face to face, but like you mean follow up?  Are you just sending it?  Because I'm I'm live transfer in all my leads.  So like I'm never not following up from the time that I call you.  Dude, I'm I'm freaking me and you are buds.  I'm calling you. I'm texting you.  I'm not being annoying.  I mean, every time I call you, you're going to you're going to salivate.  You know, I got leads, but you're going to be talking to me a lot.  I'm going to be sending you live transfers.  I'm going to be fine. Did you get that one scheduled?  Did you get that one hooked? Hey, can I call you?  Like me and you are like, I'm sending these free jobs.  They're lit. They're they're digital gold.  I'm not just going to send them and forget.  So the answer, if you haven't talked to him, was yesterday.  You're talking to this person.  You're like you are trying to get this deal  from the second you call until the second you close.  So I don't know what you mean when you say how soon to follow up.  Like you don't ever stop following up.  You're in constant contact until you get the deal.  That's the reality. OK.  Now, when to go for the close.  That's another art thing.  We teach that as I did to landlords to a T.  It's it's also something that you learn and it's there's not an exact answer.  But we have some criteria that we follow as well.  So maybe let's answer one more question if there is one.  Are we good? I think we're good.  Beautiful. Guys, thank you for being on the call.  I appreciate you guys being on the call.  I think we had 20 people, 18 people.  And I I really do enjoy doing these.  I don't care, to be honest with you, if there's two.  Last week, it really frustrated me.  There was two people and it was a Labor Day.  So I told the people that were on, I would make sure to hook them up ",

They really want to do this now to speak to a couple of you guys  that I keep seeing your face again and again and again.  I guess I'm going to ask you, like, what's it going to take for something to change?  Right. Like Jason's on this call.  He's at over thirteen thousand dollars a month right now.  He started in January. I've been seeing some of you guys for way longer  than I've known Jason.  And you're still doing nothing.  You're still refusing to to either take your own, you know, your own action,  spend your own money and pay the piper.  But you also don't want to spend money.  So I don't understand what you think.  Like, do you think that you're just going to wake up  and you're just going to get this business dropped to your lap  that's making you, you know, fifteen, twenty thousand bucks a month?  You're not going to have to work. You're not going to have to suffer.  You're not going to spend any money. You don't have to take it.  Like, I just don't get it.  So there's a couple of you I keep seeing you.  And I love you to death. But for the love,  let's go do something with the knowledge.  Let's quit taking notes and let's go do.  Like, if you're going to choose the path, you have two paths to choose.  Go spend your own money or pay me and get in my program.  That's your two paths.  OK, go spend your own money. Do it today.  And it's a win-win for me, because if you spend it today,  you're going to realize that, holy crap, I just spent a thousand bucks.  I could have just, you know, gone into Nick's program.  I could have paid, you know, started getting into it.  Like, and if you don't, then you're going to get all the information.  So whatever it is, guys, just start, just start.  Go spend some money.  And so you actually see that this isn't as easy as you think it is,  but it's also not as complicated as you think it is.  OK, and that's just for the people I keep seeing.  I love you guys showing up.  But like I said at the beginning, if you don't change anything,  nothing's going to change.  OK, so let's stop getting on these calls and doing nothing.  And I'm going to start.  Aaron, do we have a way to tracking who's on these calls?  Do we have any kind of a thing that shows us in the past  who's been on these calls?  I wouldn't know unless we just manually check the live recordings,  which we could do.  And we might do that.  I would love to see.  And I'm going to start being like, you can get on like three.  And then if you don't have a deal, I'm kicking you out of the entire group  and blocking you from anything I ever create,  because that's time, or at least show me you've spent some money on ads.  At least some of you doing something.  You know what I mean?  That's what I think. OK, guys, thanks for being on the call.  It's a beautiful September 9th.  Live in the laptop lifestyle.  We got we got we got people from Aaron.  Tell these guys where you're at.  I'm in Virginia.  No, what",

    "pageContent": " What's important that you guys understand is who we're actually writing this content  for.  And a lot of people when they get into this business, into the rank and rent digital real  estate space, or may I say rent then rank digital real estate space, they're confused  because they think their content has to be perfect.  And I'm just coming off my last video telling you we need to get obsessed and we need to  get really good at the content, but what you guys have to understand is who we're actually  writing the content for.  And I'm gonna just have you think about it like this, okay?  If you are sitting there and your tree, a lightning, whatever, lightning came or the  wind came and your tree like cracked in half and it was leaning over your roof, and you're  looking to get it solved, you're looking to get a tree company to come out and remove  it, are you gonna go and search tree company near me and go read every word on that tree  company's website?  Are you gonna go and read every single thing about how to remove a tree and what processes  we use and what saws and all this extraction methods?  Of course not, right?  So what you have to realize is in the services that we talk about, in the services that I  recommend in module one of part one of digital landlords, which is looking for layups, which  is picking the right niche, okay?  We are going into services where people just need the work done, that's the point.  They're not going to read the content, they're not.  And I'm telling you right now, I always joke about this, but if you've got somebody who  is reading every word of your website, that person is very likely a serial killer.  Who reads tree service content or mold removal content or duct cleaning content, and I'll  argue if somebody calls me on a quote form and says, hey, I read every word in your content,  what is this?  I'm not even gonna give that to the business owner anyway because they're literally probably  on the hit list, okay?  Or on America's top ten, that's weird.  No one's reading this stuff, so who are we writing it for?  We're writing it for Google, we're writing it for the search engine, so we're writing  it so that when the search engine crawls our page, aka reads our website or our homepage  or service pages, they know what it's about.  They know that it's about the keywords that we want to rank for.  They know it's about concrete contractors, concrete near me, cost of concrete, concrete  my area, whatever the keywords are, we want Google to know that our website is about that.  So what I want you to do is take a deep breath.  This doesn't need to be perfect.  It does not need to pass, you probably had an English teacher like I did that was very  critical of making sure that it read properly and all these different things.  Now you have to make sure this does not sound like it was written by a robot, so you have  to give it some thought, and as we start getting an outsourcing, that's one of the things we  have to look at.  We have to make sure that it sounds like it's actually a human, but outside of that, it  doesn't need to be interesting.  It doesn't need to have voice, and the content writers that I've hired in the past, where  Pete, they've tried to overdo it and ham it up and have too much personality, it just  doesn't work.  So guys, take a deep breath.  We're writing this for the search engines.  Don't stress it too",

    "pageContent": " Let me see.  There we go.  Okay, I don't see the Facebook comments for some reason,  but Jason, Aaron, can you kind of check that out  as we have questions, comments come in?  Can you let me know?  Yeah, for sure.  I will say that one comment I saw on the teaser post you did  that Heather mentioned that she's excited for this live  because this is one of the bigger things  that she sees as a roadblock now for her  is qualifying business owners.  Yeah.  So let's do this.  And by the way, I'm gonna give,  I'm gonna give Aaron, I'm gonna give you co-host  if you're not already because in case my internet,  sometimes it's shaky here, I don't know why.  So let's, I wanna say a few things  and then I'm gonna have Porter,  I'll ask Porter a couple of questions, you as well,  and then we'll go into some Q&A stuff, okay?  Does that sound good, Aaron?  You can hear me though, right?  Yeah, sounds good.  Beautiful, all right, so what I learned  and I'm gonna kind of go back to when I first started,  I remember back in 2016, first deal, towing deal,  of course you guys have probably heard the story,  I did everything wrong, I got lucky,  I picked the right area on accident,  the niche wasn't the greatest, but I still got the deal.  And I remember that that client was the biggest pain  in the butt of anything.  Now, yes, it was a $600 deal, yes, it was my first deal,  yes, I was excited about that more  than probably any other deal that I got,  but I had to work so much for that deal to get paid,  it was unbelievable.  And so I want you guys to know that when you get  that first deal, Porter, I know you've dealt with this,  Aaron, I'm sure you've dealt with this,  it happens, you're excited, you wanna get that deal,  that first person that talks to you,  that says they'll take your leads,  you kind of throw yourselves at them  because you're like, oh my gosh, this is actually working,  somebody's interested, and it takes you going down the road  and having the deal go sideways,  having the business owner not pay you,  having the business owner not be able to close deals.  The worst though is sending the leads,  the business owners, three, four, five leads,  and then getting ghosted because all they wanted  was freebies, right?  There's all these variables.  So guys, I've said this a few times before  and I want you guys to remember this,  just because you can get money from a person,  just because you can close a deal,  just because somebody will say yes,  does not mean that you should agree to it, okay?  It's the same thing in the free Facebook group,  I tell people all the time, and in this group as well,  just because somebody is willing to give you advice  does not mean that you should take it, okay?  Just because someone's willing to pay you  just does not mean that you should take it.  This is something that I live by,  this is including in this group,  there are people that we have gotten on the phone with,  they have wanted to join this group,  they're interested in starting a business,  and we can literally tell they are probably  not gonna finish paying the tuition,  they're gonna be a complete problem,  way more questions than, you",

    "pageContent": "know,  they're gonna take more than they're gonna give,  and sometimes it's just not worth it.  So, we wanna talk about qualifying,  and guys, I know that a lot of times,  again, during those first few deals,  it's almost like you're willing to do anything,  it's like, well, at least it's money, right?  That's not true, okay?  My first deal I got, this guy named,  what was his, I don't even remember his name,  but anyway, he was a towing guy,  I closed the deal in person,  and guys, I fought like crazy to get this money every month,  and eventually, it was just not worth it  after some period of time,  and I'm gonna contrast that,  I got a deal with a company back in 2019,  was it 2019 or 2018?  One of those years, I think it might've been 2019,  and then it bled into 2020,  this client, I sent them literally one lead,  they escalated me to the marketing director,  it was a huge company that owned another company,  and I got to the top of the company,  and guys, there was a month or two in there  that they cut me a check for $30,000,  just how big this client got,  and the most amazing part is,  this was the most low maintenance of all the clients.  Can you guys hear me still?  Okay, it's like, it sounds funny,  but usually, the bigger the client,  the easier they are to maintain, okay?  Francesca just landed us a deal for $7,500 per month,  I have not communicated with that business.  Personally, I have not communicated with that business,  I'm not interested in communicating that business.  They are low maintenance, yes, we check in once a week,  but it's worth it, 7,500 bucks a month,  so anyway, let's talk about qualifying.  Porter, I know for you, you landed a few deals,  you got excited, and you were snagging deals,  and I think you were kind of just working with anybody,  because you were just excited,  and then you ended up losing two or three of those deals,  so what did you learn throughout that process?  Dude, it was all, I was calling the wrong people,  first of all, even though I know I know  what I should be doing, I still wanna, I get lazy,  I'm like, oh, I've called everyone on my list,  I don't wanna go write another list,  so I start calling people on Facebook,  I start calling people that aren't running ads,  and I don't know why I thought that I could be the one  to just make those sales, but I'm not, and they're cheap,  everyone that's not doing that is not gonna pay  for the service, so I was calling the wrong people,  and I really don't think, the first two deals that I landed,  I was asking the right questions,  I was bringing up the objections before,  I was talking about the contract,  I was talking about how the deal would look  before I got on the call,  and there was just some things that I just was muffled,  I was just like, oh, I did that, but he already knows,  but he doesn't, you have to bring it up,  you have to ask him, and so those were some things  that I have caught myself, and even just my energy of,  being excited about the business model,  I was definitely a little bit under the",

    "pageContent": "weather,  I wasn't as excited, I was probably making it seem  like he wasn't gonna get very many leads,  I was trying to downplay it too much,  so there were some things I didn't do,  but I do think the questions that you ask  are very important, and if they say,  me and Aaron talked about this,  but if they say yes, yes, yes, you should be worried,  because most of the time, there's gonna be a few questions  that come up beforehand, I mean, occasionally,  you'll get one that's like, hey, that all makes sense,  let's work together, but most of the time,  the ones that are actually serious about it  have genuine questions from the beginning,  and they're asking you, and those are the ones  that are gonna stick with you longer.  If it sounds too good to be true, it usually is,  that's what I've learned, okay?  Another principle that I've learned, guys, is,  so I wanna come back to this port to remind me,  I wanna come back to talking to people  that are already paying for ads,  so don't let me forget that, but I wanna mention something,  guys, this is the same thing that I learned  doing door-to-door sales, is if I was on the door,  and so I looked at the sale as two parts,  the door approach and the inside the house and the clothes,  now, granted, there was actually three parts,  there was the door approach, the presentation,  and the clothes, so let's say there's three parts.  What I learned, guys, is that if it was easy for me  to get in the house, no objections, whatever, boom,  they was like, yep, come in,  I was gonna be up for a tough close.  If the door approach was tough, and I had to overcome  one or two objections before they let me in the house,  there was a good chance I was gonna get that deal,  and so back to that, I bet you every single person  out here that's talked to, made at least 50 calls,  we've all dealt with a business owner,  like Porter's talking about, yeah, yeah, yeah,  that sounds good, sounds good, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,  and you're just like, yep, and it's like,  it can't be that easy, it's not that easy.  If it's too good to be true, it probably is, okay?  If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is,  so back to what Porter was talking about, guys,  in the training, we talk about this,  in the training, we talk about when you build your list,  why not make it half as easy, twice as easy, half as hard?  Why try to, if you're calling just any random Joe,  you are having to sell them on the idea of paying for leads,  paying for marketing, and on you, right?  If you are selling to people  who are already paying for leads,  you only have to sell them on you.  You don't have to sell them  on why they should be paying for it.  So it is, even if it takes longer to find an area  with business owners that are already paying,  it's a much easier, more logical, quicker sale,  because all you're doing is saying,  look, you've already tried Home Advisor, dude,  if it's not working,  what makes you think it's gonna change?  Why don't you try this with me, right?  They're already in the mindset of the, ",

    "pageContent": "hey, I gotta spend money to make money.  It doesn't even mean you need to take the money  from the Home Advisor budget necessarily,  but there's somebody that's willing to spend money, okay?  So here's a question that I wanna ask.  I'm gonna ask Porter and Aaron,  cause I'm sure that somebody is gonna ask this  or thinking this.  Aaron, you go to an area, everything looks good,  juicy area, good lead flow, low competition,  and there's only like, let's say three, four people  that are paying for ads,  paying for some kind of lead generation.  What do you do?  If I only see three or four people that are paying for leads,  I would not go into that area.  Porter, what about you?  The reason being-  Oh, finished, finished, finished.  Oh yeah, no, I get it.  So this is especially if you're starting out,  like if you're not at 10K and I'm not at 10K,  if you're not at 10K,  these are not deals you should be pushing.  Yeah, for sure.  Like if you've got the sales experience,  you got the conviction,  you got the, like your systems are just dialed in,  yeah, you could be, you might get that work,  but that'd be like a higher skill deal to land.  And again, you could land it,  but you'll most likely get a better bang for your buck  just going with an area of more people to prospect.  Facts, yep.  There's nothing worse than finally getting leads  and then just not having prospects anymore.  It's rare, but it happens and it sucks.  100%, 100%.  Porter?  I think a lot of times if the metrics look good,  I think all of us are like, dude, I don't care.  Like there's gotta be a business owner.  Like we all kind of jump on that city that looks good.  So like if you do,  there's probably some of you that are doing this right now,  like go check and see if people are running ads.  And if that is the case, I mean,  you know your Google ads are your number one,  your home advisor and your energy list  is probably your two and three.  And then anything after that,  like you could dip into your Facebook groups,  which I'm telling you,  you're scraping the barrel.  Like I've done that before and it's not worth it  because I just lost two deals and that's exactly what I did.  But if you're not doing that,  you could also go to neighboring cities.  If you're in a suburb area,  you could go to a neighboring city that's close to it  and search it.  And maybe there's people running ads like 20 minutes away,  which people love to travel if they got the work.  But again, with Aaron,  I think if you want to start off right,  you don't necessarily want to target those areas.  But again, I'm guilty of it.  I still go into those areas sometimes  because I'm like, dude, this is a golden area.  This looks good.  There's gotta be someone that wants the leads.  I would say if you,  I think that's a really good nuance that Aaron pointed out.  And I agree with what Porter saying as well,  that if you are not at least at a couple of deals,  I'd say five, 10K, make it easy on yourself.  Make sure there's five,  I'd say maybe seven to 10 business owners ",

    "pageContent": "that are paying for some form of advertising,  whether it's, you know, ideally Google ads,  then we go with HomeAdvisor, Andy's List, et cetera.  Now, when, you know, after you've closed a bunch of deals,  you're at 20K, 30K, 40K, there were areas,  there was like two people that were paying for ads.  I was going into that area because I knew my pitch so well.  I had so much momentum.  I had so many examples of, and better yet,  it was like, I had franchised,  people in franchises that were the same.  Like I knew I was gonna get the deal,  but I was in that niche.  I was the expert in that niche.  And so it's a little bit different.  So if you guys are brand new, make it easy on yourself.  Go into an area that has as many business owners  as possible paying for some form of ads.  Now, one more thing I wanna cover  before we get into some of the Q&A stuff is,  one, like for me, any form of paying for leads  is better than none, but Google ads,  the reason I like Google ads people the best  is because they're usually spending the most money.  And this is a question I hear people ask all the time.  Well, why would they spend money with you  when they're already paying for Google ads?  Okay?  Aaron smiling because he can literally speak just like me.  Aaron, I know you're gonna say the perfect answer.  Why is that?  Why would they still spend money with you?  There's a couple of reasons.  One is it's better to have two fishing poles  on the pond than one,  because you're gonna catch more fish.  Number two, just because they're getting clicks  doesn't mean they're getting leads.  They could be targeting,  they have all their targeting settings off  for what they want.  They could have a landing page that doesn't convert,  let alone, even if those things are true,  again, what we're doing is if the ROI is still good,  yeah, maybe their ROI isn't as high  as if they get it from their own marketing source  that they manage themselves,  but it still makes sense if they make money from.  So yeah, I used to think that too though.  It's a fair question, but that's,  if you guys are thinking that you're assuming  that just because someone is running ads,  you think they're getting leads.  Google ads is to get clicks, not leads,  that you pay for clicks, not for leads.  The one advantage Home Advisor has  is you're paying for leads, not clicks,  except for you gotta share them.  Guys, can't you see how much better of a service it is  that we offer?  Like it's, we're taking the good part of Home Advisor,  we're taking the good part of Google,  and we're giving both to them.  It's exclusive because that's kind of what Google does,  and it's leads, which is what Home Advisor does.  And it's, they don't have to share it.  I don't know, sometimes you have to go  and you have to like put yourself in the shoes  of the business owner and think about,  imagine paying for Home Advisor.  Imagine as an agency owner,  you're paying Home Advisor for leads, right?  And they send you a lead,  and that lead is getting,  they're sending that same lead to five other agencies,  right?  And guess what?  One of these clients are looking for it,",

And then somebody else calls you and they're like,  yo, I'm gonna send you these jobs.  You're the only one I'm gonna send them to,  that's your job to, like it's yours to lose,  and I'm only gonna work with you.  Dude, it's an easy sell.  It's a very easy sell.  So anyway, that's the biggest points I wanna cover.  Guys, make it easy on yourself.  The easier you make it on yourself,  the more likely you're gonna be to actually,  you know, just get the deal.  And again, I know when you're starting out,  it's easy to wanna jump into that first deal,  find that first city and get started.  And I love that energy.  I love that energy.  But guys, now that we have freaking rank and run engine  where you can do a due diligence in like 13 seconds,  you guys should be tearing through areas.  You should be picking a niche  and you should be picking a hundred cities  and you should do the first 50 yourself,  create a process, get an outsourcer from, you know,  onlinejobs.ph and you should be cranking  a hundred due diligence a day to find that city.  And I would rather go a week to find the best city  and, you know, maybe it takes you three extra days  than what you were gonna do  if you would have went with that okay city.  Cause if you guys can find that right city and niche,  dude, it makes every freaking thing easier  and it's exciting, it's fun.  So anyway, I can't stress enough about due diligence.  And I think sometimes we're like,  oh, I'm doing something wrong.  But as Porter said in the beginning,  most likely you're just talking to the wrong people.  You could say the right thing to the wrong person  and it's not gonna land.  Makes sense?  So true.  And you can say the wrong things to the right person  and it might still work.  That's the truth.  So I swear it's more about the person.  So finding those right areas, number one,  talking to the right people.  And then I guess the last thing  that we can talk about really quick is don't be so excited  and salesy when someone says yes,  be a little hesitant, pull back a little bit,  be willing to lose the deal.  If it feels a little off, be willing to say,  hey, whoa, whoa, just so I can check  before I send you this lead,  but by the way is digital gold.  I just wanna make sure you're hungry to grow here, sir.  Cause I can only work with one company per area.  I've had quite a bit of interest here in Tucson.  And before I dedicate and kind of like marry myself to you,  like, can you just give me a little bit of a feedback  as to why, how I'm convinced me  that you're serious about growing.  Cause I don't wanna waste my time either.  I'm running a business just like you, right?  Don't be afraid.  People are so afraid that if they say that,  they're gonna lose the deal.  All that's gonna do is help you get the deal.  It's gonna build trust  because you're not so freaking desperate to get that deal.  So anyway, let's go into a little bit of Q and A.  We can kind of mix in some",

If you are talking to the right person that's hungry,  you can mess up a lot of the other stuff.  You're still gonna get the deal.  On the contrary, you go pick some random Joe off the street  that's in a Facebook group  that's not willing to spend 10 cents.  You could say all the right things.  The money's just not there or the mindset's just not there.  It's just not gonna work.  It is so important you're talking to the right people.  And so that's why we stress so much.  Go and sell.  That's why the module is called Selling to the Already Sold.  Building your list.  Do we have any questions so far, Aaron?  So we don't have any specific questions,  but one good comment from Brad Hardy.  This was in reference to the question  of why would a business wanna pay me  if they're already paying for Google Ads themselves.  But he said, they're busy doing the work.  They aren't watching the ads.  At all.  Bingo, like if we just zoom out,  sometimes we as marketers start a full-time job.  Sometimes we're not as focused on particular projects  or ad campaigns as we need to be.  So I don't know who doesn't know what we're doing.  So probably doesn't even wanna do it anyway  because they're like, they got that mental friction of like,  ah, I don't even know what I'm doing.  Why do you even bother?  So yeah.  Yep.  I completely agree with that.  You guys think for one second,  I mean, these people are worried about everything  from their cell phone bill to their company t-shirt,  to their insurance, to the gas.  What they did is they went to a conference,  they heard their buddy.  If they were lucky, they hired their niece  who's taking a marketing class in college,  marketing 101, learning from a professor  that makes like 40 grand a year, that's never done ads.  And that's who's running their ads.  So be a little persistent, guys.  By the way, you said there was a question  on the original post, Aaron?  Did we already answer that?  No, that was Heather's comment talking about,  she's glad this was the topic  because this is one of her main roadblocks.  Now with that, I would say,  and we can probably talk about this a bit as well,  is, and if you guys have questions,  you can drop them in the comments.  With qualifying, it seems like there's three times,  like three different stages in the sales process  where people fall off, like usually,  and this is usually because either we messed up  with our sales pitch or approach,  or because they were just a bad prospect to begin with.  And that's usually one of those two reasons.  And by the way, when in doubt, blame yourself,  just little advice for life.  But anyway, I was gonna say that,  it looks like she said that particularly,  she's struggling with, she'll cold call them,  she'll get a yes, but then they fall off  after she sends a few leads.  So it gets ghosted before the Zoom call.  That's like stage one of bad qualifying,  like second stage, it seems like,  would be where you hop on the Zoom close,  and then there's just something that they throw at,  that's just clearly they're not a good",

    "pageContent": "fit.  So I was talking with an illegal immigrant  on a close call at one point,  didn't really work out one of those things,  that bad qualifying job.  And then finally, number three would be like,  as you were talking to me about,  is if they're, you got the deal,  but they're just not handling the leads well,  because they don't, and then they just,  they fall off because of that, if that kind of makes sense.  So like before the call, during the call,  and then after the sale.  100%.  Let's talk about when you're getting ghosted,  because I know this is a pretty like,  okay, so you build the list properly, boom,  there's seven to 10 people, you got your pitch dialed in,  you get the deal hooked, and let's just say,  let's talk with, let me ask Porter first.  So Porter, you get them, they're excited,  yeah, sounds good, send me a couple of leads,  boom, you hang up the phone, and first scenario,  first circumstance is,  they never answer the phone again after that, right?  You haven't sent them any leads,  they're just kind of ghost after that.  What do you learn from that, what can we,  what can you do, and what can you learn from that?  If you get somebody hooked,  and then they never answer the phone,  you never send them a lead, you try to send them a lead,  but they just ghost.  This happened a lot when I first started out,  and I do, and I don't know if this is 100% the reason why,  but I felt like I was saying too much on the first call.  I was, you could always add more information to them,  but you can never take away.  So as soon as you start talking about SEO, backlinking,  you being able to rank these websites,  these guys are like, what the crap did you just say?  And then they get all weirded out by it.  So I felt like I was saying too much to the point where  I was trying to sell them on the first call,  and so I stopped doing that.  I stick exactly to the script, I do the bare minimum,  and then I can always add onto that.  But if someone was to ghost me,  I mean, that's where the pullback,  you have to be like, dude, it's okay,  I have the fear of no loss, whatever,  give them the pullback, say, hey, Mr. Business Owner,  I understand you're busy,  but I am trying to run a business as well.  If you're interested in these leads,  message me back by the end of the day, if not,  I will start sending these to somebody else, thanks.  Something along those lines,  and if they are interested, they will come back,  and if they're not, then just move on.  I wouldn't even be emotional about it.  100%.  In the training, we talk about this again.  Sorry to keep going back to the training,  but I'm gonna go back to the training, right?  Which is, you remember the example I used, guys,  we're selling a date or dinner, not marriage, right?  We're not going in, frickin' first time meeting a chick,  and then we're like talking about marriage.  That's when people get weird, dude.  They're like, yo, I'm never talking to this guy again,  right, that's weird.  Unless it's your",

    "pageContent": "boy, I'm closing that thing first date.  Everybody else cannot do that, okay?  No, I'm just kidding.  So I saw this happen in door-to-door sales.  Porter had a good point.  I would see this happen with new reps all the time.  Can you guys still hear me, by the way?  I was a little choppy, I'm sorry.  Good?  All right, so new reps, when they first started,  including me, we'd give them a pitch,  and it was a four-step pitch.  Who you are, why you're there, the deal,  and the transition, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, okay?  And every time you teach them the simple pitch,  they do it, they get in the house,  they get their first deal, maybe five deals,  and then all of a sudden they'd stop closing,  they'd go into slump fest, okay?  And every single time you would go with these reps,  you would find out they were just vomiting information  on the door, right?  They were jumping ahead and skipping steps.  And I like what Porter said, he's like,  you can always give them more, you can't take it away,  and there's a quote that says something like,  the man that doesn't talk can never be misquoted.  Just in sales, sometimes more is less and less is more.  Be very succinct about what you have to say,  but don't over-talk.  They start asking you questions.  This is common, right?  We get our first couple of deals,  and then the business owner's like,  dude, but just tell me,  how much are we looking right now?  And you're like, well, and you just drop price, right?  There's a reason we do it in the order that we do it,  or they'll say, so yeah, dude,  I'm happy to do 10% split.  And instead of you going,  hey, let's not worry about that right now,  and explaining it on the screencast,  and at the end, you're like,  nope, the only thing that I do is flat fee.  And then all of a sudden,  the business owner doesn't understand  why the flat fees make sense,  and all they're gonna do is just ghost you.  So do not freaking skip steps.  Keep it simple.  Less is more, more is less.  Talk to the right business owners.  You just guide them through the process, okay?  Also, let's talk about the second situation, Aaron.  We hook a business owner.  We, you know, sounds good to get a couple of leads.  You send them two, three leads.  This one's the most painful.  You send them two to three leads, and then they ghost you.  What can we learn from that?  What do you do in that situation?  Yeah, it seems like when that happens,  it's gonna either come down to  they were innately not a good fit,  or again, you messed up somewhere along the process.  And I'm gonna be honest,  it is really hard to tell sometimes with those situations,  because then you're thinking like,  well, did I say something?  Should I have said something else?  There's just a lot of variables at play.  And usually, obviously, you first wanna look at yourself  and, okay, did I say too much?  As you talk about your new reps, your sales guys,  like they're probably giving too much information.  So it could have been on your end.  And if you can't find",

    "pageContent": "anything,  then you can kind of begin to think,  okay, well, is this business owner just not a good fit?  But, and sometimes it seems like there are businesses  that have just been burned so bad  by other marketing companies  that they're just completely closed off.  It makes it kind of weird  that they would take a couple of leads,  but some just don't trust you.  Nothing you do can make them trust you,  even sometimes when giving free leads,  it almost seems like,  where they just don't believe it.  And again, that might be where you might need  to be a bit more persuasive in your approach, perhaps,  but that one's a bit more dicey.  Yeah.  And that's where the only thing you can do  in a situation like that,  if you're literally getting ghosted,  is you have to just take control back.  You have to take the deal off the table  and you have to have some huevos  and you have to send the text.  You have to send the text.  That's it.  So, and we've talked about length.  I'm sure there's three different lives we've had  inside this group on the pullback, right?  The breakup text, that thing is money.  It's a little bit scary in the beginning.  And it's always like, you're, you know,  and the best part is when sometimes you send  the breakup text and the business owner  tries to make you feel bad, like, well, I'm not,  you lost me at that.  You lost me.  And it's like, bro, shut up.  You guys have had this, right?  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  I've never done that.  And even if they did, those are the type of people  that cancel after week three  because the leads were slow that week.  Yeah.  A hundred percent.  Guys, I'm at a point in my life and in business especially,  but if there's a relationship,  whether it's a business relationship, a friendship,  whatever, and people get like,  if I can tell they're gonna be difficult  and high maintenance, and it's gonna take me a lot to make,  like, I meet a new friend and it's like,  they get offended easy, dude.  It's not my friend, bro.  Like, I just don't have the energy.  If I meet a business owner,  I don't care what you're willing to give me.  I used to be the guy, and maybe you guys wanna do this.  I used to call, I would call it an a-hole tax.  So I would be like, okay,  this person's gonna be a difficult,  they're gonna kind of be an a-hole.  I'm gonna charge them extra.  And if they do it, I'll still work with them.  And I would put up with quite a bit  because I wanted the money.  And even now, I just won't do that, dude.  If somebody's difficult with, like, I just won't.  Like, we've had, we've had students, dude.  We've had students that, like, we can just tell,  and we're like, yeah, it's not worth it.  Go your merry way, you're not worth anything.  And it's just, no amount of money is worth it.  So keep that in mind, guys,  is if somebody's difficult in the beginning,  they're probably gonna be difficult throughout.  And depending on what you're,  like, you'll get what you tolerate.  And I won't tolerate much at this",

    "pageContent": "point, right?  I know what I'm worth.  I know I'm valuable.  And my tolerance has gone completely down.  It's very low.  I have a very low tolerance for a bunch of weird people  that I'm just not interested in talking to.  So just be choosy, dude.  It's your business, it's your clients.  You get to choose who you work with.  You get to choose the price.  You get to choose how you do business.  You get to, it's literally how you build it  and what you're willing to tolerate and accept.  And that's the beautiful thing about it, okay?  So biggest takeaway I'm gonna say from qualifying  is it's most likely an issue with who you're talking to,  not an issue with what you're saying.  In sales, most of the time,  if you're losing someone at a certain step,  it's the step before, right?  If you're losing them when you're trying to get,  when you're cold calling, trying to do the hook  and you're not hooking anyone,  usually because you're talking to the wrong people, right?  If you're losing them, when you're sending them leads,  usually when you did the hook, you oversold it,  you said too much, whatever, you freaked them out.  It's usually the one or two steps before.  So you're not closing the deal,  you usually didn't do the setup correctly, right?  Which by the way, starts from the moment you call  to the moment that you close the deal.  Any other comments, any other questions that people have?  Yeah, we got some comments that started rolling.  And so real quick, this is just, we can address this.  Corey Gilbert said, if I got 80 clicks and only five leads,  is that a good ratio?  I think that's 16%.  I was trying to do the calculation while you're talking.  So 16% like click to lead ratio.  I think that sounds pretty good to me,  depending on the niche, I guess, right?  If it's plumbing, it's probably pretty bad.  If it's basement waterproofing,  that's a good conversion right there.  Okay, so let's see.  Corey made the comment,  I don't see how rare is faster with DD.  So Corey, I don't know if you've like ever done  a market research like template on your own,  like Google Sheets, like kind of in the original training,  but it takes a long while to go over the individual backlinks  and everything,  because you're able to just put in one thing.  Yeah, I don't-  You should go try, what you should do is go to,  I think in the training,  we talk about like how to do the due diligence  with the sheet.  Go and open up a Google Sheet  and go and copy and paste everything in.  Look at the backlinks,  go and find the age of the domain.  Get a White Spark account and get a-  Get a White Spark, go do all of that.  Yeah, go time it.  It's way faster.  It's probably four or five times faster  to do it on due diligence.  You're probably comparing,  I think you're just comparing that to,  I don't think there's any other comparison.  Go try and do it manually.  And by the way,  for those of you that don't want to use Rankin Energy,  you don't have to use it by all means.  I did my first, not thousand,  but probably my first hundred due",

    "pageContent": "diligence,  not even using the template.  I used to print the pages off  and I would write them physically out.  And I had this stack of due diligence  and I would sit there and I would spend  three, four hours sometimes in a day,  just looking at cities, just clicking through cities,  copy and paste and clearing my browser history.  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  Okay, yep, yep, yep.  And the other problem with that guys is you're human  so you're not going to see as much stuff.  You might read it wrong,  like all these different variables.  You don't have to use that tool.  But what I was saying with my point being  with using Rankin Engine is that  if I could save even five minutes  and I'm doing 20 due diligence,  dude, I mean, I just saved myself what?  Over an hour, almost two hours,  hour and 40 minutes.  Like that's insane, right?  And I know you're saving 15 minutes per due diligence.  So anyway, sometimes there's no context.  Go do one manually.  But even if you don't want to,  then just use the regular sheet.  The point is you got to put in the reps.  And the reason I know how to look at a good area  is because I've literally done over a thousand myself.  So I know when an area, even if it looks good,  oh, that thing's off.  This looks like that one time that I tried it.  And then, so as much as I want to train  and as much I want to show you,  it does take you doing reps to figure it out.  But great question, Cory.  Yeah, and for the record,  the reason it took Nick four years to scale  was because he was doing his due diligence on paper  in the 21st century.  Just throwing that out there.  All right.  That's just a small example of a much larger problem.  I was doing everything in my business.  Old school, slow, I'm doing it myself.  I'm writing my own content.  Like I was not going to let go of sales.  I didn't know how to scale.  And finally in 2020, I was like, okay, let's go.  But yeah, good point.  That's right.  So Jason, great question.  Will there be a module  where we can look over your shoulder  doing due diligence in R&R engine?  We aren't rank and rent engine.  We are working on redoing the due diligence training.  Of course.  And by the way, we are going to be using  the rank and rent engine tool  with the new training as the go-to tool.  Because I know in our original one,  I used a couple of different tools  and I kind of said use whatever.  It's easier if I can just use one.  In this one, we have control over.  We trust at least to a certain extent  because we can only trust Google's data they give us.  But yes, that's going to be part of it for sure.  So just as a heads up,  we might have something even released  a little sooner than that.  Kind of give you guys some snippets.  You have to wait for everything to come out.  But yes, that's a really good question.  Jason, all red?  No, that was Jason Adam.  Okay, great.  What's up, Jason?  Yeah.  That's right.  So real quick, let me see this question.  Okay, yeah.

    "pageContent": "guys, new to the group.  So Joe, let me get back to you that in just a second.  I'm going to try to answer any qualifying questions  that a lot of people are having  rank and run engine questions.  Let me see.  Also, real quick, there's a, what's the code?  Somebody had a couple of people message me.  Can you, can someone post the chat?  The code for the discount is capital land.  It's all caps landlord 24.  Okay.  You want to drive that?  You can put that in there.  I'm looking through the comments.  Porter, can you put that in?  Yep.  All caps.  This for digital landlord students.  Correct.  Landlord, all caps, landlord, one word, 24, no spaces.  That's for, I think 20% off for the first two months.  Again, guys, use whatever you want to use.  You don't have to use anything.  If you can get around and you can plug this and plug that,  you don't have to.  We're just trying to make this  as easy as possible for you guys.  And for me, if I can go and I can save two hours a day,  look at 20 more due diligence,  maybe find one or two extra good cities,  that one or two cities every day times five days  times fourth weeks, times 12 months.  Dude, I'm light years ahead.  But sometimes when you start,  you're just thinking about, you know, whatever.  You're thinking about, I'm going to do this manually,  which is fine.  Go do it manually and then you'll appreciate it later.  So, but yeah, landlord 24 is the code.  What other questions?  Yeah.  So Julia has a really good question.  Says, what are the main questions you asked  during prospecting, live transfers and following up?  If you guys already answered this, it's no problem.  I'll just rewatch the live.  We can address this specifically.  I did put in the comments  because I kind of anticipated this.  Fixit Felix, a while back, he made a post  and kind of just assembled a lot of the qualifying questions  slash green flags.  And then of course the opposite of those would be red flags.  He looks for one qualifying business center.  So I put that in the chat.  And Nick, I also texted it to you and Porter in Slack  if you guys want to look at that real quick.  But it kind of, these questions just,  we look at them to check off the main boxes.  And I kind of talked about this earlier,  but hungry to grow their business.  Not only that, kind of a nuance is hungry to grow,  like hungry for the specific leads in the specific area.  That's something that if you miss that,  that can turn out to be a bad fit.  If they have to travel 50 minutes  and you don't realize that for your tree trimming job,  you know, they're not gonna really be wanting to do that.  So a couple questions.  I'll let you answer these, Nick.  Okay, let's go rapid fire through the questions.  And real quick, let's, I love this green light  in qualifying questions that you put.  I think we can just copy and paste that  as like a parting little gift for everybody.  So let's just rapid fire these last few questions.  We'll drop that.  That's gonna be the green light, you know,  and also the qualifying questions  that you can, as like a takeaway. ",

    "pageContent": "And real quick, if I could ask you, Nick,  and I can give my quick 20 second opinion here.  It seems like there's a balance on the cold call.  If you ask too many probing questions,  it's easy to lose the deal and spook them.  And like, it's easy to lose.  But then on the same end,  you don't want to wait till you've sent four leads  before you start to ask some discovery questions.  So for me personally, it kind of seems like  after I send that first lead,  then I can kind of like,  I now earned the right to like investigate to some degree.  I don't know what your thoughts on that.  Or like, if you have discovery calls after the cold caller.  100%.  Dude, from the top, as soon as I get the deal,  if I feel confident enough to send them one lead  and I don't feel like they're shady  or trying to get a free lead, I'll send them the lead.  And then I'll call them back after they get the lead.  Like, hey, did you get that schedule?  Awesome.  Hey, I want to ask you really quick.  Like, yeah, you've earned the right to ask those questions.  And sometimes on that first call, I can tell,  hey, dude, I actually was talking to my partner.  This is something we're super interested in.  Yo, you're from Utah.  Like, they're just warm.  I'll feel comfortable to do that right there.  But a lot of times I do wait till the second call  as I'm building the trust  and earning the right to ask those questions.  Yes, exactly.  Sure, if you hear the chainsaw in the background,  now's not a good time to ask how many crews they have.  That's exactly.  All right.  That's exactly right.  All right.  Yeah, I just put that in the comments.  I'll do it one more time.  If, Nick, you want to just read through  those qualifying questions,  you can just kind of sprinkle these up  throughout the sales process.  Obviously, the earlier, the better without spooking up.  So I'm going to just read through  the qualifying questions right now.  Some that you could ask, you don't need to ask all.  And you certainly don't have to ask.  These are just some good ideas, okay?  Do you want more jobs, which is part of our script, right?  Hey, are you hungry to take on more jobs?  I'm guessing you're not allergic to money  and you're spending money on ads.  I'm assuming you want more jobs, okay?  Then you can also ask  if you will specifically want a certain type of job.  You can ask how long they've been in business.  That's indicative of like,  if they're maybe going to go belly up  or they have any money in the bank.  Oh, I just started last week.  I have a chainsaw and a truck.  That one could last two days or, you know,  those are rough.  I've worked with those people before.  They never pan out.  Making sure that they're licensed and insured.  That one you might want to bring up  a little bit down the road.  Cause if they're not, you might spook them.  Again-  If they have a green card at the minimum.  About a hundred percent.  Yeah, you got to make sure  they at least are legal in the country.  That's a given.  I don't know.  That one, I'm not sure",

    "pageContent": "we're going to include that  in the training or how to bring that one up,  but maybe we'll do that on a special section  if you're targeting certain states.  How many crews do you have?  And then how are you currently landing your jobs?  Are you getting them from Facebook?  Is it referral?  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And another question I might ask is,  you know, I would ask this at some point,  but you could also ask us on the opening calls,  like, dude, it sounds like you know what you're doing.  Like what?  You probably have a pretty high close percentage, right?  How many deals are you closing out of the,  out of the leads you're getting?  Or are you closing what percentage?  And they're usually going to be like, oh, like 90%.  And it's like, well, that's cause you get all your jobs  from referrals.  So they're already sold, bro.  It should be a hundred percent.  So actually anything below a hundred means  you're sub-optimal human and you suck.  But good job.  Here's, should I go over the green lights really quick,  Aaron, to wrap this up?  Yeah.  And obviously the opposite of these would be red flags.  100%.  Here's some green lights.  If they're hungry to grow,  if they're hungry for specific leads  in your specific location,  if they have bandwidth to grow,  if they can actually handle more jobs,  if they've been in business for at least a couple of years  and that they're licensed to ensure,  these are a couple of green flags.  Anything opposite of this is going to be red flags as well.  But guys, I guess as my final thought,  you can have all the answers.  You can have everything dialed out in front of you,  but until you just start making calls,  you're not going to know what the heck we're talking about.  It's not going to make sense.  It's not going to be relatable.  You got to pick up the phone.  You got to make the mistakes.  You're going to have to call and say too much  and bomb it on a business owner verbally  until you lose the deal on the perfect business owner  that was going to pay you all this money.  And you said too much, you lost the deal.  I mean, Porter has lost like $3,000 a month  in retainers over the last like six hours, dude,  or six days.  I mean, Porter's just giving away.  Just throw it.  Just give it.  No, I'm just kidding.  But you have to lose these deals, guys.  I've lost deals saying some of the most silliest stuff,  embarrassing stuff.  I mean, it's just dumb stunts.  And this is including alarms.  Like I've lost thousands and tens of thousands of dollars  just saying and doing the wrong stuff.  And it took those deals that I lost  to get to where I am now.  And so I looked at it as like a debt  that I was paying towards learning how to do this.  So I think no matter what we said here, guys,  if you're not doing calls, if you're not making calls,  none of this matters.  Step one, make calls.  Step two, figure out where you're going wrong.  Take the information we shared today and start refining.  Become obsessed with your craft.  Become obsessed and dial them.  Because if you can get 5%, 10%, 15% better at this,  again, the",

They're the people that know how to get business owners  to give them their credit card.  They don't even have the best product.  They don't even give their business owners the most leads.  They're not even the best at retaining them.  They are the best at getting business owners  to give them their money.  And so you don't have to be in sales  or have a sales experience to start,  but it is in your best interest  to start obsessing over this skill  and at least do it until you get to a certain revenue level.  And then sure, go ahead and outsource it.  Find somebody to do it if you really, really hate it.  But this is a skillset that has the highest return  of any skillset in this business.  And it is called sales,  and it is taking candy from little children.  I'm just kidding.  All right, anything else?  Any other questions?  There was a couple of questions on rank and rent engine one,  but I don't know if, is there a live,  like when I'm trying to think of something we can,  something we can point them to  if they have more questions about that.  I'll text Ryan right now  and see if he wants to go live in the group  and kind of ask those questions.  If you wanna screenshot those and send me a text after,  let's separate those,  so that would make a really good live.  I think there's probably gonna be a bunch of questions  that have come up sitting out that people are using it  and whatever, but that's a great point.  Will you text me?  Yes.  Okay, guys, if you-  So guys, we're gonna address those questions.  Yeah, so those aren't gonna get ignored.  Yeah, no, for sure.  In fact, let me just text him  so no one thinks I'm making that up.  Hey, I'm on the call,  the live right now.  We have some people that have questions  about rank and run engine.  Anyway, rank and run engine.  I'm gonna say wanna go live-  We have one more qualified question  we can ask after this.  Okay.  Okay, go ahead.  Awesome.  So Mike Price says,  what do you guys think about selling to the top,  like one to five organically ranked companies in the city,  people who have probably invested in SEO at some point?  As long as they're running ads, dude, I don't care.  I got a business owner right now in one of my areas  that is ranked on Google.  They're also paying another company to do what I'm doing.  I think that they might just be paying them to do SEO  and they are buying leads.  So as long as they're running ads,  they're still hungry to grow, dude.  If they're not, I don't really see that,  I'm probably not gonna target them.  That I do like, if I don't have any,  if they're not paying for ads,  can't find anyone in the Facebook group,  the fact that I can tell they've done SEO  at least lets me know they spent some money  on their market.  They paid somebody to build their website.  That's at least a start,  but I'd probably try to target somebody  like on the bottom of page one, top of page two,  where I can tell their page title is done  by someone in those SEO.  They have an",

So, but if they're paying for ads,  I don't really care where they're ranked  because they want more business.  Most of the big companies, by the way,  that client that was paying me like 30 grand a month  at one point, all of the cities  that we were getting leads for them,  their website was ranked at the top three with us.  They were just hungry.  So it doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter.  Just go for it.  Sometimes you gotta stop overthinking too.  And it's a great question,  but I think sometimes the reason  that someone like me and Porter  and some of these guys are doing well  is we don't overthink  or we're too lazy to think or we can't think.  I don't know.  We're just like, oh, sweet.  Pick up the phone, call, give them a couple of leads,  build up a little website.  That sounds easy.  And that's why we do it.

So once you do the due diligence, you know what the top three websites are that are ranking  in that area.  Look at how much content they have on their pages and double that, double the competition.  So do better than everyone else that you're trying to rank for.  And then the standard, if you want to know an average, would be we usually do 2,000 words  for the homepage and then we do 1,000 words for each service pages.  So that's 3,000.  If you have a website with one homepage and three service pages, that is 5,000 words worth  of content.

Well, I'm gonna tell you why, okay?  And it's something I really want to point out.  Some of you guys are coming to the table, some of you guys are just jumping to this  program, this is your first introduction to Rankin' Rent, okay?  Maybe you've done digital marketing, maybe this is your very first time doing a business,  maybe this is your first time doing an online business, whatever the case is, some of you  are brand new to this, others, some of you, or others, are coming and you guys have been  in Rankin' Rent for years, you've taken other programs, you've done other things, you've  been Udemy and whatever, Udemy and whatever, you've bought other courses, and you're coming  to the table with 5, 10, 15 websites, and guys, here's the cool part, you can use this  exact same process to sell other websites that are producing leads, okay?  But here's what I want you to be careful of, the number one thing that I see, the number  one hang up I see as far as people getting in the program, taking longer than they should  to get their first deal, is people, it's the following, okay?  People that come into this with existing websites, and in their head, they think the following,  okay, here's what I'm gonna do, Nick, I'm gonna come in, I've got 5 sites, I'm gonna  use this process, I'm gonna sell all 5, because I'm paying for hosting, I'm paying for phone  numbers, I'm paying for this and that and the rest, I'm gonna sell all 5 of those, get  clients, and then I'm gonna go do new projects, I'm gonna go pre-sell new websites, okay?  And I get it, in a perfect world, and with an engineered brain, everything fits into  a nice little box, and whatever, that's cool.  But guess what, here's what I would ask you, and this is what I want you to ask yourself  as you're going through this first module that you just went through.  If you had known what I just went through, the videos that we just went through, the  last few lessons that we just did, if you had known those things, and you're looking  at your site, maybe you got a site in, you got a roofing site in Ontario, Canada, okay?  If you had known what I just taught you, would you still have built this site, the one that  you're thinking of, the one that you're like, hey, I'm gonna go ahead and use this process  to sell it, would you still have built that site had you known what I just taught you?  If the answer is no, then I do not want you to use that as your first site.  I want you to either put it on the shelf and keep doing SEO, keep doing your regular thing  on it, or get rid of it, okay?  Because sometimes it's better just to cut it than try and squeeze blood out of a turnip  or whatever that saying is, okay?  And so what I've seen happen is people come in and they're like, hey, this site's getting  like two or three leads, and then you look at the market research, it's really competitive,  it's the wrong",

Well, you're not following the criteria, you're not following the process that we just talked  about for the last couple hours, okay?  So here's what I want you to do.  If you have existing sites that are producing leads, what I want you to do is I want you  to run them through the exact same due diligence market research process that we just covered,  all of them.  Yes, I know, it's extra work, don't care.  Go and do that, and if those sites fit the criteria, they're low-hanging fruit, they're  layups, the CPC is under five but over zero, the volume matches, if those all check the  boxes, you got some freaking gold on your hands, baby, and you should use that website  first and you should go sell it, okay?  If they do not fit the criteria, then you either need to put it on the shelf and keep,  you know, do an SEO, doing your regular thing, or get rid of it, okay?  Sometimes the best thing is just to get rid of the dang site and go on to stuff that actually  works, okay?  Here's the game.  We need to get you to your first deal with this process, okay?  I don't care how much money you're already making, I want to get you, I need to get you  your first bit of money using this process, using the process, the results in advance  process that we teach in this program.  Why?  Because if you can get the first deal, there's this mental barrier that gets removed, you  go see it over and over and over, and there's tons of students in this program, some of  you guys that are watching this right now, you've seen it in your own business.  Takes you three years to get your first deal, you go in this program, you're in another  program for three years, you come in this, you get your first deal, and it takes three  weeks, and guess what?  Your second deal takes four days, or a week, or two weeks, but it happens right after,  and then guess what?  You get another one, and you get another one, and if you keep working, you keep getting  deals, so I know this game.  The game is I got to get you to getting your very first deal using this process.  I don't care if you've gotten previous deals, I don't care if you think you got deals because  you got paper lead and commission deals, or even if you got a flat fee deal, I want you  getting your first deal using this process, because what it's going to do is it's going  to give you trust, it's going to give you that confidence in this process, it's going  to remove that mental block that, oh, I can actually do this, and all of a sudden you  take off.  Guys, I just want to let you guys know before you go, I'm just going to go sell all these  sites because I don't want to pay for hosting, maybe what you need to do is get rid of those  sites.  I'm not telling you that's the case necessarily, but maybe you do.  Make sure that's the case before you just dive in.  For those of you that are brand new, don't even worry about it.  Follow the steps that we've talked about.  Pick the niche.  If you don't know what niche, pick concrete, do the homework, pick a great city.  Let's go make some money. ",

I've heard arguments that Google doesn't like duplicated content so I've heard arguments both ways as well. All I'm going to say is that I don't do it. I've never done duplicate content.  We have a really like my content writers, we have two content writers, of all places in West Africa where I'm moving.  These are Lebanese. These are both Lebanese girls and I say girls they're they're women. They are incredibly educated Lebanese women they both have their master's degrees.  And what happens is we assign them content we teach them how to write content we assign them content. And we first and foremost we check it for plagiarism, right, and I trust them but you just never know.  So we check it for plagiarism, and then we go through it and we make sure that you know it sounds readable. We don't want it to sound like a robot wrote it we want to sound readable and sometimes when you are, you know.  Anyway, that's our process so I don't do it, I don't even mess with it, I don't try to because in my head it's like, by the time I've, you know, taking the content and pulled out the cities and done this and done that.  Man, I've spent half the time it would have taken me just to write new content or paid somebody to write me new content.  And I'm risking duplicate content so I don't touch any of that that's just my personal experience. If anyone else wants to give their opinion that's had experience, I just don't mess with it.  100% organic content, 100% my own people, and I not only played check it for plagiarism but we read through it for punctuation we read through it for readability. We spend a lot of time on good content, because it matters, because I know I can't change the age of my domain.  I can't change the age of my domain baby. What I can do is I can go get backlinks, and I can write great content you know what else on that point Tim is think about it like this.  I'm willing to go and rewrite content for pen concrete sites and write it from scratch.  I'm most likely going to be the next guy, the next guy, he's just trying to get a paragraph up or a couple sentences up so he can have a website to put on his business card, or her business card.  Okay, I want to dominate the areas that I can control, because I can't control the age of the domain so especially if you go into an area, and your main competitor has a 20 year old domain, you better be bringing the heat on the content, and you better be looking  for backlinks and you better be dialing everything else in because it's going to be, you're going to have to make up for that age of domain with your other stuff.

So really quick, the Google trifecta, that is the three different sections of Google.  First we have the ads, which is the very top section of Google.  So if you do a search, boom, you're going to see that at the top, it's going to say  ad next to it.  That's the ad section.  The next section that we're going to have is what we call Google Local.  It's also called the Google My Business or GMB or Google Business Profiles, whatever.  They keep changing the name.  It's also called the Map Pack, the Three Pack, whatever.  It's probably going to be called the Dinosaur Pack by the time this video.  I don't even know.  Whatever Google decides.  Larry Page and Sergey Brin, shout out to you guys for having some creative minds.  I don't know.  That's the local section.  And there is a specific strategy to ranking in that section that we are going to be covering  in a later module.  And then underneath the map, we have the third section, which is what we would call to or  I'm going to refer to as the actual organic listings, which is underneath the maps.  That's where your website ranks at the top of the organic.  So there's, depending on the search, there's usually one to three ads.  Then there's three in the map.  Sometimes there's four because there's an ad in the maps, if you look really careful.  One of those is an ad.  Then there's 10 search results.  And then sometimes you'll see some ads at the bottom.  And that is what makes up the Google Trifecta, ads, local, and organic.  Very important.  You understand that.  Let's keep going.",

Cause I got actually a message from one of the people in the group saying  that the only thing that they didn't like is the,  the quality of the voice.  Cause I was just using the microphone on the, on the camera.  So I played in the actual mic.  So you guys, hopefully you can hear me in.  HD now.  I guess.  Cool. Morgan.  I appreciate you making the time to jump on.  So for those who don't know who Morgan is,  tell us a little bit about your background, where you came from.  And how do you find yourself here?  Yeah. So actually it's funny.  I, I went to the military to be a special operations.  Combatitive.  And I washed out on a medical injury.  Then I got lucky enough to get into the military.  And then I got into the military.  And then I got into the military.  And then I got lucky enough to get stationed in Hawaii.  And even though I was in this wonderland, I,  I want it more for myself. I felt like this isn't enough.  I need to figure out what's next.  So I saw this guy walking around the barracks and he was always just  looking so dapper.  He had a dress shirt, dress pants, a tie, just looking real fresh.  So I ended up going to him and being like, Hey man, what are you,  what are you getting into?  What's your reason for dressing like this?  Cause all the rest of us are just young people clocking into work,  coming home and figuring out what we're going to do with the rest of our  day.  Long story short.  He introduced me into this world of entrepreneurship,  but he was operating in an MLM.  And once I got wind that it was something kind of fishy,  I did a bunch of research.  And in one of the breakdowns,  I found a link to rank and rent.  And then that's how I hopped on and I made my commitment right away to  start giving myself to this business model fully.  And that's exactly how I made my exit plan from the air force.  How much did you",

I've never been a big fan of authority,  but you have to learn to follow before you can learn to lead.  Good point.  So you did that.  And then you,  you discovered MLM and it was kind of up your alley,  but not so much not.  You wanted something that's MLM,  but better than MLM,  like a little bit more upside and you found rank and rent and you're like,  Oh, this is better than multi-level marketing.  What drew you specifically to it?  Like when you watch these Nick videos, like what, what was it,  what was about it?  So to answer your first question as well,  I just didn't want to build my success off of other people's failure.  And that really is what MLM comes down to.  There is a very,  very small percentage of successful people in that.  So all the people you're bringing on likely will fail.  And what attracted me to the rank and rent model and to,  to Nick, I got into the rank and rent model before Nick,  but whenever I was introduced to Nick,  I took it from two to 3000 all the way up to 13 was my highest month that I  saw.  And it was just helping people, man,  helping people put bread on their table. And then I get it.  I get a slice of that bread, you know, for me, it's always been, if I,  if I'm not building my riches off of helping others to some capacity,  if I can't at least tell myself that not everyone else has to feel the same,  but if I at least can't tell myself that then I'm doing something wrong.  I like it. Yeah.  The, I heard this just the other day.  The right thing to do is always the right thing to do.  Yeah. And when it feels right, like, yeah, no, yeah.  When you've got, we talked about gut too, like that gut feeling.  When you don't feel it. I mean, you had this high, I mean,  the force or the air force is as high and persistent as it gets,  but still you found yourself in there, but it didn't click with you.  It didn't jive with you. So you wanted something better,  even though everyone that's in the air force was probably like, yeah,  this is it. This is, you know, as good as it gets, you know,  but you were still, you know, striving. Now, tell me about the two to three K.  What year was that as opposed to the 13 K per month, which is your peak,  right? Maximum that you got is 13. Okay. So what, what years were those?  So two to three K,  I want to say that was about a year and a half, two years in.  And what is that like 2022?  Oh, no, no, no.  It was either 2020 or 2021.  And I'm sure we'll get to it a little bit later,  but I had a lot of shiny object syndrome in my time.  So, yeah, I want to say it was about one in 2020, 2021.  It was right around beginning of COVID time where I started to really draw  in some money from that and then started to develop my exit plan.  As I started to count some of my eggs before they hatched,  because I just knew that staying under that umbrella of authority wasn't what  I wanted to do.  And",

That's who you are.  Yeah. And I like also that you phased out.  I did the same thing. I had a full-time job. And then when I started this,  I went into part-time and hired someone and then switched,  trained them to do what I do, gave them the full-time, took the part-time.  And then three months later, I just phased out until instead of just pulling the  plug and going full board, that's a little scary.  Easing into it is the way to go.  And a lot of students are actually doing that in the group.  They have full-time jobs, full-time parents, bad asses,  and they also carve out time to go work on this, the rank and rent.  That way they're easing off of the work.  They're phasing out and then going full-time into rank and rent.  Yeah, I like it.  13K, obviously got some shiny objects in your way, some rabbit holes.  We all do. I still do.  I just got two companies yesterday reaching out to me to build big websites.  So that's going to be a rabbit hole.  So it's my focus now to make sure that my team is self-sufficient.  I don't have to touch those websites. I don't have to think about them or anything.  So yeah, it is an ongoing thing.  And if you think that you've passed it, you are mistaken.  It's going to come again and again and again.  Because the more you gain experience, the more people put you on a pedestal,  the more you deliver to people, the more they believe in you and they give you other things.  Like, oh, you're great at rank and rent.  Can you do my social? Can you do this?  And you start throwing things at you.  I mean, it's your job, sure, to take care of those people, make that green, make that money,  but without sacrificing your time and your focus for rank and rent.  Because that's what happened.  I get pulled into a project and then I wake up like three months later.  Like, what happened?  I made some money with that website and SEO, but there goes three months.  I didn't touch any rank and rent in three months.  So what was your situation, Morgan?  How did you get distracted?  So actually, right away, I don't know why I felt like I needed someone to be there by my side.  You know, who knows?  Who knows?  In my younger years, maybe I was subconsciously lonely.  Maybe I just wanted someone to be big with.  But when I left the military, I called up one of my buddies and he was making money.  He was making money.  Go ahead.  He was making money in a not so enriching way, but had a lot of entrepreneurial experience.  So I asked him if he wanted to come on as a partner.  Obviously, he wouldn't get any of the profitability of what I've already accomplished.  But if he helps me to do these new sites and things like that.  So we gave it a shot for a while and he made a little bit of money, but it really didn't work.  And then we separated and we made what's called state of mind labs.  And we were doing hemp, just basically hemp wholesale to various countries,  mostly Japan, Australia, Denmark, Ireland, a lot of different areas like that.  Like for fabric and rope and stuff? ",

And then state of mind labs started to show this potential of making lots and lots of money.  So little by little, more and more of my attention started to shift.  And at that point in time, I still didn't have a full time team around me like I do now.  So it was a lot of work that just wasn't getting done the way it used to.  And then after state of mind labs, I created another company called Ion Solar.  And this was to do with me creating customer flow.  And then I had three other partners and their jobs were manufacturing equipment  and creating that culture for the sales reps to go out and close these deals.  Great concept, but I took a lot of people on that had no experience whatsoever.  And they were really in that blue collar, nine to five mindset.  So it was really hard to keep accountability for everyone.  That was one that didn't last long, but took a lot of my funds.  And then I saw my marketing company coming down from those big numbers  and hitting lows as low as $3,500 per month.  And my savings were just getting eaten into.  So we closed down Ion Solar.  And then we opened up another company called Shenzhen Sales Ventures.  And we opened this one up because we saw that state of mind labs was dying.  The wholesale industry was getting too competitive  because manufacturers were figuring out how to get that same visibility  that the brokers like ourselves were getting.  So we weren't really able to middleman as efficiently.  So we were like, okay, well, now we know how to build a sales organization.  So let's go into the retail space and we can just broker for all these other companies.  We did that for a while, but we found out that even though we were running up the commissions  super high for our people and they would just be making aggressively good money,  whenever you don't pay that base salary, you really can't hold them accountable either.  So it just became a lot of accountability.  And I just couldn't figure out how to hold all these other people accountable  in these other business models.  So then I came back.  I told my partner, I said, hey, look, I don't want a partnership with this.  I took a lot of the heavy load.  So I want you to get me back this much, but the company's yours.  Keep it.  And I'm shutting down all the other ones except for my marketing company.  I'm going to go back to my roots.  So that was about two years, two years of being completely off track  from when I had hit 13K and then I had to start building back up.  I had a couple of $3,000 a month, $3,500 a month, which just was not cutting it,  not when that is your primary source of income.  So what I did was I moved back home to get a big reset.  And it's been the best thing I possibly could have done.  I've been away from family for seven years.  I come back and I'm enriching those relationships again.  I got back up to $10,000 a month during these holidays.  October was my $10,000 month.  These holidays, November, December, $7,500.  But I'm actually pretty happy with that because I didn't lose any clientele.  Some websites during the holidays will still get leads and some will get zero.  Absolutely nothing.  And just me in the",

That's just not in me.  And I know other people aren't always the same and I don't judge those people.  Everyone has the right to make their own decisions in this life.  But now I came to the conclusion that I have no interest  in building any partnerships with anyone  because in this business model, you really don't need anyone.  You don't need anyone else except for yourself.  And as far as the shiny object syndrome,  I've got a lot of other business models with low-hanging fruit  that I'm just pushing off, but there is one thing I am working on.  And what's so cool about it is it plays directly into what I'm already doing,  which is SEO.  And that is targeting luxury real estate in certain areas of the country  so that all I have to do,  I don't have to go out and hunt for my own people to sell their homes  or to go and find them to buy homes.  And it's in a luxury market,  so the dollar is going to go a lot further for those commissions.  But every day I can just wake up, work on my marketing,  have my secretary handle all of my customer flow for my real estate stuff.  And if I have to go do a meeting, okay,  put my team to work for the day, make sure everything's going smoothly.  And that's it, man.  That's my vision for the future.  I feel like I just didn't know how to manage in the past.  And you always think you can do more than you can in the short term,  and you always underestimate what you can get done in the long term.  And those are wise words, man.  I definitely agree with you,  but I also want to commend you for being entrepreneur ballsy, okay?  Because not everyone can just get up and say,  hey, I'm going to start a solar company.  And you look like you're in your early 20s, right?  Mid-20s?  27.  27.  I mean, yeah, mid-20s.  I mean, that's the age where you need to be ballsy and go all out  and try different things, absolutely.  But in your advantage, you matured early, you made mistakes early,  and you found yourself back.  There's nothing wrong with being entrepreneurial,  but it's like a later step.  It's like a phase three or phase four after you've mastered this,  after you've built your cash, after you've built your assets.  You're like, okay, everything looks good.  Time to jump into, take this cash and go invest it somewhere else.  Yeah, I mean, your head is in the right direction.  I think you were just a little early.  I was early.  I shouldn't have jumped.  Too much too early, right?  Too much too early.  You're so right, man.  And a lot of people say don't do business with family,  but I always thought if you can't trust family, then who can you trust?  Or friends, if you can't trust friends, then who can you trust?  But at the same time, one thing I had to learn was  you can't just turn these people into what you want them to be.  They already have to be those people.  And yeah, if I wouldn't have jumped ship so early,  I'm sure I would have had a lot more patience.  And I was always looking for",

I have a minimal standard of 15,  and I'm really aiming up for 20 before the end of this year.  And then obviously with the real estate stuff on the side,  that'll add in some fat paydays as well.  So we're on the right track now, 100%.  But yeah, definitely jumped ship a little too early.  If you think that it's the right time,  weigh out the pros and cons because I was just excited, man.  And that excitement can bite you in the butt sometimes.  I almost jumped into swag.  I almost started selling swag.  Actually, Nick did. Nick jumped on it, and I didn't.  And I remember him just being like, wow, that was dumb.  This was before the program, by the way.  Yeah, we made mistakes too.  Nick got into swag.  He would make promotional items, and there's a site,  and you order them, and they go straight to the customer.  I was about to jump on it, and then he was complaining.  I was like, you know what?  I'm going to go back and get out of this rabbit hole  and go back to my track.  So yeah, we've all been there.  We've all went into those rabbit holes  and came back with more wisdom and more maturity.  Like, oh, it doesn't have to be complicated.  It doesn't have to be big.  It doesn't have to be elaborate.  Simple and stupid sometimes pays the bills.  Sometimes we get too smart for our own good.  Like, oh, this is easy.  I could definitely fit some more stuff.  Let me go look, see what else I can do.  No, no, no.  Just take the same wheel that's turning  and just spin it faster and faster and faster.  And then once it starts to wobble, add another wheel,  turn that faster, and then you keep adding those wheels  instead of going and finding other stuff.  There's something in a book that I read,  and the book is called The Way of the Superior Man,  and this can apply to women as well,  maybe not the whole entirety of the book,  but the concept is living on your edge, right?  And when you live on your edge,  you want to be right over your edge, right?  Because if you go too far over your edge,  you're going to be spread too thin.  And if you're not on your edge at all,  you're in the level of comfort.  You're in the zone of comfort,  and you're not going to grow at all.  So just pushing yourself just right over that edge,  where it's a little uncomfortable, but it's manageable,  and you can flow, and you can just find your rhythm.  That's where you want to be.  Yep, absolutely.  And putting people in the right place.  I think that's instrumental too,  because you can stick to one...  You have a really good point.  Yeah, you stick to one thing,  but then as you rinse into repeating,  you hit capacity at one point.  And it's like you're going 120 miles an hour,  and then once you hit 140 miles an hour,  your steering wheel starts to shake.  And that's when you're like,  oh, okay, I need to hire someone.  I'm going to start offloading.  That's your sign to start",

Like in your case, you've got a secretary,  and anything that doesn't have value,  like a task that doesn't have a lot of value,  you pass it on, and you just keep the high-value tasks.  And then even those high-value tasks,  once you master them, you get an expert to push those on.  Like I stopped building websites,  I stopped doing social, I stopped doing all the technical stuff.  I used to do all of it, and it sucked,  because I was my own bottleneck.  The work was slow because of me.  The minute I got an expert in each thing,  content manager, web developer,  they're doing a much better job than I did.  And now the wheels are turning faster and faster.  So yes, sometimes we are our own bottlenecks.  And that could be another thing to touch on too,  is you have to know when it is the right time  to start delegating that work,  because I have always been such an excitable person,  and I feel like now I can be a lot more serious,  and I can weigh out pros and cons a lot more efficiently  because of all those failures  that have allowed me to be more successful.  That was another one I did.  I hired too much too early on,  and now I feel I found that perfect balance  that allows me to grow,  that allows me to just spread everything out  in a more strategic manner while still keeping me busy,  because there were times where I hired too much,  and it's like, all right, what am I even supposed  to be doing right now?  You know, so that's definitely another thing to consider.  Nice. Tell me about this team.  How did you hire the first member of your team?  The first member of my team was just all-inclusive SEO,  and I felt like my on-page was really strong,  but my off-page is what I always wanted to master.  I feel like off-page is harder for most people.  So I hired someone that was really good off-page,  and she manages everything as far as backlinking,  contact, outreach.  She manages our content writers and our blog strategies  and our interlinking.  So she started with just off-page,  and then she evolved into doing a lot of other things  as well, interlinking.  Project manager, then. It's kind of a project manager.  Yeah, for sure.  She's really evolved into her role,  and she's definitely the most independent  of all of my people.  So sometimes she's a little harder to get through  than the others, but that's kind of what you need, right?  If you're going to look for a leader,  you need someone who's going to be a little more independent,  who's going to be able to take things into their own hand  and to just move forward.  One of my greatest additions, however, I feel,  was my Google Business Profile Manager.  She is an absolute rock star.  I don't understand how she gets as much done  as she does in time.  I use Hubstaff, and she's busy 90% of the time.  Her screen's just moving.  And she actually turned out to have some hidden talents  as well with graphic design.  So now she'll do designs for the website,  even though she's only ever done graphic designs  for different posters and different posts  and content for social media.  But it turns out she has a knack for web design as well.",

I kind of got a little spoiled to that.  I'm sure there will come a point  where I become too busy to do that.  But right now, that's all I do is sales and development.  And everything else is outsourced.  Sales and development.  I see you outsourcing the development  and keeping the sales.  Once your sales becomes overwhelming,  yeah, I see you definitely passing the development over.  I do too.  I had tried it, but I didn't like it.  I have had, that is such a hard thing to find,  is a good developer.  I can't tell you how many developers I've collaborated with  since I've gotten into this business model,  and I might have had one out of 10 good experiences.  Really, I've had amazing developers.  Hit me up, I'll help you.  I'll find you a rock star.  Yeah, I've been especially lucky with web developers.  Sales, not so much.  I've failed so many times in finding salespeople.  Commission only.  I mean, yeah, you can find the base pay everywhere.  They just get paid and do office work.  But I wanted a closer that can just work off commission  and just hit them like whack-a-mole, right?  I did not find them.  I hired and fired and hired and fired.  But the web developers, I can hook you up.  That's easy.  I actually got them from online, jobs.ph.  That's the sign-up for them.  That's what I prefer as well.  Yeah, and the developers that I have are amazing.  Like you said, they have hidden talents.  So you get a developer and they already have a background in IT.  Heck yeah, IT.  I want someone who knows IT because we have server issues.  We have all kinds of stuff.  Yeah, I'll take IT all day.  They have SEO backgrounds.  I love that.  But you've got to set the parameters.  It's tricky because SEO is an ocean, right?  It's like the Pacific Ocean.  And the SEO that we do is like just the island of Hawaii.  We do a very specific type of SEO that is white hacks, not spamming.  You can do all kinds of SEO.  So it is important if you're bringing an SEO person to set parameters for them.  Here's a due diligence sheet.  Here's how we survey, how we do the find the low-hanging fruit.  Here's how we do this.  Here's how we do this.  That way you narrow down what they're working with and they're not sabotaging your stuff.  Not intentionally, of course, but they might sabotage your stuff.  They might sabotage your stuff unintentionally by doing things that they think are right or white hat.  I like that.  Black hat's going to become extinct.  What's that?  Black hat will become extinct.  Yes.  Yeah.  I mean, yeah, all the platforms now in search engines have AI and they're cracking down hard.  It worked when I first got in.  And I know it worked for people even more before I got in.  But man, white hats, when there's Google updates now, I look forward to them because my site.  Yeah.",

So right now you have this rock star person that's like organizing your life basically, which I find myself in the same same situation.  I have an amazing project manager, an amazing team, but especially an amazing project manager.  Because like you said, I don't have she's very intuitive.  She knows me.  She knows what decisions I'm going to make before I make them.  And she goes and makes them on my behalf.  She goes and answers emails and deals with customers and all that stuff.  So I'm free to do the business development before I struggled.  I did the dance.  You know, the prospect fulfill prospects fulfill.  And you're running around.  If you're fulfilling, you're not selling.  And once you're done with the fulfillment, you're like, oh, my gosh, back to sales.  My sales are dropping.  And then you go start selling, selling, selling, selling.  And then you're like, oh, I got a couple of accounts.  You go manage them.  And then you constantly back and forth instead of sticking with sales and whatever you're selling, you're throwing over to your team.  And you're still in sales.  You're focusing. You're not running back and forth between fulfillment and sales.  So, yeah, it took some time, but I think I'm 95% out of fulfillment.  I still have my hands a little dirty, but that's the plan because I'm realizing that that is what affects sales.  It's going and doing the fulfillment.  Now I am the face of the company.  That's who people buy from.  They buy from me, not from my company.  So I have to show my face.  I have to be looped in on the emails.  I have to do certain things.  But I'm working on removing myself because I'm not adding anything that's of value.  I sell and my team takes care of everything, and they do it better than I do.  So why would I be in the way?  Why would I, you know, jump in there?  I hear that.  My hands are definitely still a little bit dirtier than yours are as far as staying in the trenches and doing different things like that.  But that's OK with me.  You know, I took a lot of risks.  And now I kind of did have to pay for those risks a little bit, but a lot, actually.  But that's perfectly fine because you are who you become.  Like, that is your value.  And that's why you always see these people, right?  They go on YouTube and they're like, oh, billionaire starts with zero dollars.  How fast can you get up to that?  Right.  And it's because they are not their assets at that point.  They are the person they become and the abilities that they have within them.  So I'm OK being here right now because I do have that abundance of time as I make my move.  When I'm making my move at the beginning of the new year to go and to also take on the real estate stuff, then my hands will definitely be a little bit less dirty in the marketing realm.  And I'll be focused on sales for homes and sales for rank and rent.  And then I'll have my teams doing all support, filtering through all the nonsense that I don't need to be looking at.  And that'll be all I'll be worried about is just interacting with my clientele.  And that's what I love. I'm a big people's person.  I'm",

It's extremely manageable whenever you're not, you know, giving all of your attention to this and that.  You know, if you have a secretary to qualify your leads on the real estate side, I don't I don't foresee it being any sort of an issue.  The issue is always that I was trying to just hit grand slams all the time.

He said that there's a lot of hotels looking for wallpaper.  Let's get a service page out for that and let's target these keywords.  I've given them a lot to work with.

And they learn very quickly.  Their ears are open to hear.  And I have another guy and he'll also help with the blog strategies.

I prefer real content.  I know you can get away with a content for a lot of stuff.  And I did that for state of mind last for a while, but I prefer that real content.

If you want to rank for something on a blog, you give her the topic and you let her run with it.  Outbound links, inbound links, 2000 plus words.  She can write about anything and it's none of its filler content.  She's a superstar.  She's also got her real estate license in the Philippines.  So whenever that started up, she's going to be able to qualify people on a really intimate level to ensure that none of my time is wasted.  So, yeah, my team's been awesome and I couldn't do it without them.  They truly do give me the time to",

Now, tell me, how are you going to weaponize this team for 2025?  What are you going to do that's different from from 2024?  I think I think I'm just going to make an addition as far as the development.  And what I really like to do now that we're actually starting to come into a flow is I would like to have more cohesiveness and more of a culture.  I know with whenever I had my sales organizations, we would always do these big group Zoom meetings and things like that.  And the key is to not overdo it. You know, you want your people to be at work as well.  But I think that's probably going to be that next step is going to be to get everyone on the same page together because I've been noticing like there's some information gaps here and there.  And it doesn't happen often. But when it does happen, you as a leader have to be like, how can I prevent this in the future?  And for me, that's that's really what I believe is going to do that.  And there will also be this person on the GBP side will be like, we need to target these the most.  And then this person on the SEO side will be like, we need to target these the most. And there's that there's that gap right now.  So that's probably going to be the main thing that I'll do is develop a more cohesive culture now that the team is growing and getting larger.  So there's like a better flow, like less clunk in the operation, better information flow.  And and everyone's the main priorities of the company overall will be a lot more clearly visible.  Yep. And you're trying to hit 15 K. Is that the goal for early early 2025?  15 K is the goal for the first couple of quarters of the year.  And I want to be well above 10 K sitting comfortably in the 10 K plus range in that first quarter of the new year.  I didn't know you had this kind of operation. I thought maybe you had one employee. But I mean, if you have these kind of resources.  Oh, yeah, it you just have to be really careful with the due diligence.  The way I do it is I do it with my SEO gal.  So I would do the due diligence, come up with the idea and then pass it to her.  And she does a deep dive. And then she tells me, oh, this is a yay.  This is a nay based on the parameters that I gave her, of course.  So I do like an initial due diligence and then she goes and actually pulls everything.  The Google Trends, the AHA Trust, the Google Analytics search volume, all that stuff.  And then she gives me the I tell her I need a low hanging fruit.  You can give me a big city where I can make bank, but I'm blowing a lot of money on Google.  I would rather get that smaller, way smaller city that has a really good low hanging fruit, but I can get organic free leaves.  So she's smart, man. I didn't I didn't always take that route.  I mean, you can go look up Dallas. I've got number one sites in Dallas.  I've got number one sites in Oahu, a lot of big areas.  But with that being said, I've been in this game for so long that even though I wasn't giving it the attention it deserved, I have so much referral work now.  And I have so much people that are",

    "pageContent": "paying me to power up these websites for them.  It's just it makes sense. It makes sense to do that sometimes.  I play the game. Don't get me wrong. I have a site in Seattle, Washington.  I have a website in Milwaukee, like some really big, big cities.  But I learned that it takes less time and effort to go to a smaller city or just a city over and break records.  Like everyone's like bunched up in that city trying to get every crumb of bread.  And if you just move over just 20 miles, you'll be taking everybody's lunch.  And yeah, that's that's what I'm doing now. Like I'm I'm trying to take it easy.  Don't go for I'm going for high niche, obscure city.  Before I used to go for obscure city. Sorry. Big city, obscure niche.  Now I'm flipping it. Just regular stuff that I do. Epoxy, whatever.  But I'm looking for that obscure city that everyone is asleep.  How many leads do you find you generate in your smaller cities and what kind of a population size could you give 100,000?  I don't like under 100,000. It needs to be 100,000.  But, you know, when you got like two million people, that's when you're going to find big competition.  So when you find, you know, two to four million, just move over to the suburbs and you'll you'll probably strike gold just in the suburbs,  which is also a back door to the big metropolitan area, the suburb itself.  Like you're still collecting leads from Chicago, but you're all the way in Naperville or Batavia or the west suburbs.  You're an hour away, but you're still pulling from Chicago. That's just an example, of course.  Yeah, but I like it, man. 15K is a great goal.  I think we should set up a time for like February to, you know, have a touch point and see where you're at.  This is a great goal. It's not too hefty.  And at the same time, it's because you're going to be doubling what you're making right now, right?  Seventy five, eight thousand a month. So you're going to have to double that.  When you double that, it's going to feel good. It's going to catapult you to the next phases.  I kind of I kind of feel more like I'm starting at 10 to after these holidays push past.  That's going to bounce right back up to that number.  But nonetheless, we're at 75 right now. So you're right.  We are going to be doubling it. But I that's my complete intention.  And we're going to make it happen in there. You've been there. Yeah.  Yeah, you've been there. You can do it again.  The my thing this year is to focus on the hooks.  And I mentioned this in other lives is if I can have four hooks a week constantly.  I just closed one yesterday. So now I have three hooks today.  I need to get a fourth hook because when you keep selling them or losing them.  Now you just have one hook to work with.  That's not enough because you might lose two clients that you closed five months ago  and now you lost two and you have one hook that might close and might not.  So having four hooks for me keeps my my my head space same.  And I'm not desperate. I'm in control.  And I have control over the situation, not the business owners and control of my fate.  I really like that. I have been in this business for over four years",

You just you never you never know how long it's going to be.  And obviously the better performing sites are going to hold it down a little bit better.  But some areas get more spam and that'll just it'll just make someone so mad that they'll just drop it at some point.  And what you do to try and get rid of that spam.  So, yeah, you're completely correct in saying that it's like this this game is like you can find some lifers, but not everyone's going to be a lifer.  Yep. Lifer is a good word. Yeah, absolutely, man.  So, yeah, when you keep the numbers high on your end, you don't get desperate.  You don't you don't get scared. Fear is a big thing.  And fear is smells, you know, these business owners are like tarantulas.  They can smell, you know, how a tarantula can like smell fear or whatever and bite you if you're freaking out.  I didn't know that. Yeah, they like they smell that.  What's the hormone for fear or excitement dopamine?  Skydivers. What do they get? They get that rush. Adrenaline.  Adrenaline. Thank you. Yeah.  Apparently, tarantulas that smell adrenaline. Yeah, guys, Google it.  And I may be, you know, talking about it, but I heard it.  So, yeah, business owners, they smell that, too.  And they see that you're like, oh, my God, I'm freaking out.  It's Christmas and I don't have any more hooks. This is the only hook I have.  I have to close it. I have I have to tell them everything and it just oozes out of you.  And they're like, oh, yeah, no, thanks.  But when you have four hooks, you look comfortable.  You kick back. You're like, yeah, this is my price. This is how it works.  I thought you were interested in business. I thought you wanted to grow your business.  And now you're throwing all this stuff at me and you don't want to move forward.  What's going on? And you're very calm and you're very collected and you're argumentative.  You're bringing solid arguments. They can't they can't compete with that.  So they buy. Yeah. You get emotional or you get scared.  You lost the deal. That's right. Absolutely.  Well, I appreciate you jumping on. This is really valuable, man.  I took some notes and I'm definitely going to use some of the stuff that you talked about.  I like the way you're structuring your team.  I think that's going to be the biggest tool weaponize your team to the max  because and give them as much as you can.  I always say you don't need a meeting. You just need a screencast, like just record.  Every time they ask you a question, record a video for them and send it to them.  That's what I do. And it has been so instrumental because by the time we get to the touch point,  the weekly touch point, I've already sent them two videos.  They know what I want. They already elaborated on what I want.  They gave me even more better ideas.  And yeah, every time you want to communicate with your team, send them screen recording because those stick.  And if that question pops up again, here's that link. I answered it",

    "pageContent": " [\"Take Me By Your Side\"]  Everyone has the same question,  and they always ask, hey, what should I expect?  Like, what's actually possible?  If I come in this program, I go through it,  like, what could I do?  How much money could I make?  How many deals could I get?  Okay, and I will tell you right now  that there are people in this program  that have already done this,  and in their first month, they have done eight deals.  No kidding, we have a student that got in  within 25 days, eight deals, okay?  We also have a student that took a little bit longer.  It took them five weeks to get a deal.  They got a deal for $5,400 per month, one single deal, okay?  So, the possibilities are great,  but I wanna set expectations,  just like you should with your clients, right?  Just when the business owner says,  hey, how many leads could I reasonably expect?  You're not gonna go and tell them,  hey, you know, I got this guy named Bob,  and he has this site, and it's getting 100 leads.  Cool, Bob has 100 leads,  but if you set the expectation for 100 leads,  you are going to be just dealing with a mess, okay?  So, I wanna set the expectations right here,  and the goal and the expectation is that within 30 days,  you should at least have your first deal,  and you need to realize, like,  I need you to get your deal in 30 days,  as bad as you need to get your deal in 30 days,  because that's how I grow, and once you get your deal,  I'm going to do an interview,  that's gonna be more social proof,  and that's just how this works.  So, I am very, very invested in this, just like you are,  because I need you to get deals,  but I just wanna set the expectation that,  I know some of you are gonna listen to that and go,  oh, one deal, like, that's it?  I got way bigger goals, that's cool,  and I'm really cool with that,  but here's what I understand,  is the first deal is the most important.  So, the goal is, and the expectation is,  follow the training, go through the modules,  do as I've instructed, okay?  Go through them, each one, and do exactly what it asks.  Don't just watch it, and then don't do anything.  Do exactly what it asks you to do,  and the expectation I have for you,  and you should have for yourself,  is that within 30 days, within the first month,  you are getting your very first flat fee deal.",

First of all, I want to let you guys know what I'm going to do is anybody that's watching  this entire call that's on this the entire time.  We are going to just like last time, we're going to screenshot your name and we're going  to send you.  We're going to take all the information that we have in this presentation and distill it  down to something that's like consumable, like some type of a digital resource, whether  it's a list, whether it's a whatever the case is, Aaron's going to create it and everyone  that stays on this call the entire time is going to actually get that resource.  Okay, so just stay on and then you don't have to worry like we will give it away to a couple  people in the free group, but you guys don't have to worry about like commenting and stuff  like that.  So just so you know, that's kind of the thing that we're going to do to incentivize you  guys.  We want we want you to stay on.  Okay, so one thing that I realized this week as I was preparing for this and I was I was  doing my own education for myself, I realized that sometimes I assume that everybody knows  who I am, you know, like they know my entire story.  And because I've said it so many times, it becomes very boring to repeat.  But I want to just quickly, I basically want to just let you guys know if you're new to  this, if you're new to this group, you're new to this, this space, rank and rank digital  real estate, I want to like give you a reason to consider listening to me.  Okay, I don't think you should believe everything that I say or anything that I say, I think  you should test everything.  But I want to give you a reason to consider listening to what I have to say.  So quick background, 2016, I was knocking door to door.  I was tired of it.  I needed something that was online.  I wanted to travel the world.  By the way, here we are in Dubai doing exactly what I wanted to.  It's amazing.  I wanted something that was recurring.  I wanted to be able to have a life for my family, my kids and give them experiences.  And so in 2016, I got into this game.  I took my own advice that I give it and I found somebody that had a program and I did  the call and the whole thing, not even thinking I was getting sold.  And sure enough, I got sold and yeah, it was a thing between me and my wife.  She wasn't super excited about it, but I made a lot of money from it.  So I always remind her that I made a good decision.  So I've been in the game for eight years.  There was a little hiatus in there where I got some shiny object syndrome.  I tried to start a software company, but I've been in this game for eight years.  I've also spent and lost millions of dollars making mistakes, including at one point four  or five million dollars.  And I think it's a little bit higher than that now just on ads.  And I did that.  And the reason why I have this group is so that you guys don't have to, you don't have  to go make the one point four or five million dollar lessons.  I can teach them to you.  OK, so eight years in",

    "pageContent": "2020, I finally figured it out.  There was some missing pieces.  That program that I was in, it was good, but there was missing pieces.  There just there was a lot of stuff that just these little things.  And finally, in 2020, I was able to scale.  I figured it out.  I nailed it.  And we went from eight thousand dollars a month in December of 2019, where I just about  walked away from the model.  I just about decided, hey, I'm just the sales guy.  I don't know if I'm cut out to be an entrepreneur.  Maybe I should just go sell for somebody else.  I was this I was this close.  I even had the deal in place, the commission, the company I was going to sell for.  And I looked at my goals and I wanted to make one hundred thousand dollars a month.  And I started to realize I'm like, Nick, you're never going to get there by doing by going  and selling for somebody else.  You just can't.  It's just it just doesn't work.  Right.  OK.  Yeah.  Maybe there's someone that sells commercial real estate at a brokerage.  OK.  For most people, it's impossible.  And so I luckily I doubled down, tripled down, got really focused and said, I'm going to  sit in this.  I'm going to figure this out.  And I changed my mindset from I'm going to try this for a year.  I'm going to try this for a week.  I'm going to try this.  And whatever I change it until I change it to, I'm going to do this until it works.  And I don't care if it takes five years.  I don't care if it takes 10 years.  This is the model.  And so we went from it's funny.  As soon as I got I switched that as soon as I got focused and I got rid of all the other  side businesses and everything else, I went from eight thousand dollars a month in twenty  nineteen December, July of twenty twenty, we did one hundred thousand dollars per month,  one hundred percent of that was Legion, zero SEO, zero consulting, zero side business money.  That was all from Legion.  And it and it was it was interesting.  I didn't even know.  I just I could just feel the momentum.  I didn't even know we were doing that well.  So that was in twenty twenty twenty twenty one.  We did one point four or five million dollars of top line in just my agency.  That doesn't include, you know, my program.  This was just in my agency.  And I know that because I remember looking at it and going how much of this was and I  think we made a little bit more than that because we just launched.  So in twenty December twenty twenty one, we launched digital landlords.  And the funny thing is, I use the exact same strategy, the same scripts, the same techniques,  the same everything that I teach in the program to sell the program.  And we launched it in December twenty twenty one in the very first year, twenty twenty  two.  We also did another seven figures with the program.  The point is, and I would say the most exciting part, the most exciting part about that is,  yes, we've had a lot of success with the program.  I've had a lot of success with the agency, but the best part is we we've had students  have tremendous success.  So I think you guys have probably seen this name, but Ryan Dalton, somebody that joined  with me like two years ago, just over two years ago, he just hit seventy",

And so my ultimate goal with what I'm doing in this group, what I'm doing online, what  I'm doing with my program is I want to make I want to create a hunt.  I don't want to take the credit.  I want to help a hundred people become millionaires.  That is my ultimate goal.  And I have the business model that can do it.  And now it's just about finding those hundred people and helping them along the way.  Not everyone's going to become a millionaire.  That's just the reality.  But that is my ultimate goal.  And so that said, guys, that's why I'm doing this.  That's why I'm on here.  And of course, I'm in this for business.  I'm in this for money, whatever the case is, I'm not going to lie about that.  But just so you guys have an idea, those are some reasons maybe you could consider listening  to me.  So my goal with this specific training, guys, is I want to walk you through the pros and  cons of high ticket versus low ticket, including the lessons I learned and the lessons I guess  that I gleaned as I, when I started, jumped into both right away.  And I was trying all kinds of niches and all kinds of cities.  And I didn't know what I was doing.  And I was just making mistakes.  And I'm going to talk to you guys in this on this presentation or this call.  I'm going to teach you guys or talk to you about what worked and didn't work and also  the pitfalls to avoid.  And so the goal for me by the end of this next 30 minutes is I want you, every single  one of you on this call to be able to have enough information to make a very educated  and confident decision on which one is right for you.  And I would also go so far as to say that I don't think there is necessarily a I don't  think it's black and white.  I don't think it's binary.  I think there's shades of gray.  And so maybe for you, based on your situation and your appetite and your goals, low ticket  or high ticket may be for you and other people may be different.  The goal is by the end of this, you have enough information and you are going to be confident  and educated enough to make a decision on which one you want to pursue.  And I would recommend that you do one or the other, which I'll get into in a moment, not  do both.  OK, so I want you guys to be able to know which route you should take to start building  or if you haven't started to start building or keep building if you've already started  rather your rank and rent digital real estate empire.  OK, so what I would like to do to get started.  I don't want this to be like super stiff, me just up there at the pulpit preaching like  a pastor.  But so what I want you guys, if I ask a question and I ask for feedback, I understand some  of you guys may be like on the move or some of you guys may be taking care of kids or  whatever and you can't.  But it would really, really help.  And I pay attention to who interacts.  But if you guys could, if I ask a question, I want you guys to be in the comments.  I want to be able to see what people are saying.  And it just allows me to see who's paying attention and see what the energy is.  So what I'd like to do to get started is number one, as I said, if you guys have any questions",

There's no stupid or basic questions.  OK, so what I want to do to start off this conversation, this presentation is I want  to ask everybody to drop a comment with a niche that they are considering going into.  OK, and again, there's no bad answers.  Don't think, oh, I'm going to put this and Nick's going to just tell me I'm stupid because  you guys might not know.  And I will tell you if it's not a good idea.  But I'm curious and I would love to get your feedback on everyone.  Drop a comment with a niche that you are considering going into.  OK, and what I would like to do, well, let's let's give everyone like a minute to do that.  OK.  Also, one thing while you guys are doing that, again, drop a comment of a niche you're  thinking about going into.  Aaron, if you would help me out in addition to admitting people, you just make sure that  everyone's on mute.  I don't hear anyone, but I just want to make sure that we're not getting completely sidetracked.  So somebody new comes in, just keep everyone on mute.  And then when we get to question and answer, we can unmute if you don't mind.  So here's what we got.  We got artificial grass.  Love that niche.  Artificial grass, fencing, good cleaning service, air duct, event photography, heat pumps,  electrical repair slash paving, epoxy garage floors, plumbing, spray foam installation,  garage building, concrete, home interior innovation, house painting.  OK, we've got a good mix.  We've got a good mix.  Gutter installation.  OK, I like these.  And we're going to talk.  By the way, if any of these you guys want feedback on, that could be a question I answer.  And at the end, I could do rapid fire like yay or nay.  And if I have a second, I can tell you why.  Because I've done almost every single one of these that you guys have put out, with  the exception of like, I think I've done all of them.  I don't think I've done home interior renovation, but I do have an opinion on it.  I think I've done the rest of them.  Yeah, I think I have.  And I've failed at a lot of them.  I have not done event photography and I've not done specifically heat pumps.  But everything else I have done.  So I can give you guys really good feedback because I've done it.  So, OK, if there's any more, let me know.  If not, we're going to continue along.  Now that we've got everyone here, what I want to say real quick,  I don't want to say this at the beginning, but the reason that we're doing this new  format, because if you have been in the group for a while, the free group,  I used to just go live in the Facebook group.  And then I had like it was like vanity metrics.  Like, how many people can we get on the call?  Can we get 100 people?  And thank goodness, I've like realized that doesn't matter because I don't care  if there's one person on this call, if there's five, that'd be great if there  was five thousand, but I don't know what it is.  But in every area of my life, I'm just realizing that quantity is so much  better than quality",

    "pageContent": "in the content that you produce, in the businesses that you  have or business that you have in the relationships that you have.  All of these things always about quantity.  And so as I told you guys, my goal.  Ultimate, ultimate goal is to help 100 people become millionaires.  That's the goal. And so I look at like, if that's the end goal,  how does everything that I do, the content that I post on my stories,  the things that I do in my Facebook group, do I even have a Facebook group?  What are the the the topics of discussion here?  What are the what what is my my inner community, my digital landlords program?  What does it look like?  How do I hold people's hand all the way to the finish line?  All of that is with the idea in mind, like, how do I get 100 people  to become millionaires? OK. And so for me, as I look at this group,  we just had to like we weren't getting a ton of people that were on the call  that I felt were serious. It was just dead.  And it was it was whatever.  And so we're like, all right, let's do this.  We may only get five people on this call, but it's a risk we're willing to take.  But for me, it feels like the best way that I can help you guys.  Is to work with you more intimately,  where you can ask me questions, where you can, you know,  the things that you normally wouldn't get access to, you will get access.  And this is the most intimate way that I can, you know, assist you  without you being inside of my program.  And so that's why I'm doing this.  That's why I'm going to continue to do this.  And so that's that's why we made that change.  So once again, if you guys stay on this call, for those of you  that joined a little bit late, we are going to be making a free resource  based on the information we present in this call on low ticket versus high ticket.  And it's it's going to be a digital resource.  And Aaron slash Donnie Dre are going to be distributing that to you guys.  You don't have to worry about commenting on a post  if we give a few extra copies away. OK.  Yeah, that said, let's go into low ticket versus high ticket. OK.  So, guys, I'm going to try to get through this part pretty quick  so we can get to Q&A, but there's a few things I want to just  highlight and focus on as we go through this. OK.  So let's just really quickly.  I don't want to assume anything.  I don't want to assume you guys have a certain level of knowledge.  I'm going to pretend everyone's brand new to this business model.  What is low ticket versus high ticket?  OK, I'm going to make this definition really easy.  Low ticket means the price of the service is relatively low.  High ticket means the price of the service is relatively high.  And I'm saying relatively because some things might seem expensive to some people.  Some things might seem cheap to other people.  But we're talking relatively speaking. OK.  What are I'm going to go over a couple of niches that fall into low ticket.  And these just came into my head.  I think, yes, these ones I'm going to mention are all ones that I have personally tried.  So we've got carpet cleaning would fall in low ticket.  Towing would fall into low ticket.  Cool cleaning would fall into low ticket.  Handyman would fall into low",

    "pageContent": "ticket.  Locksmith would fall in the low ticket.  There's another one I saw a garage door repair would fall into low ticket.  OK, these are some ideas.  These are some examples of low ticket. OK.  On the other hand, what are some some niches that would fall into high ticket?  We've got artificial grass.  We've got roofing.  We've got remodeling.  We've got foundation repair.  We've got pool construction.  OK, just to give you guys a couple of examples.  And to show you the differences.  Low ticket, high ticket, very simple.  One of them is high ticket for the client.  And typically that usually translates to more money in the business owner's pocket.  Not always, but most of the time, if they're charging more money,  they're going to make more money.  Some of these businesses have terrible margins,  but not usually these services we target. OK.  So I want to talk about the pros and cons of low ticket  and the pros and cons of high ticket.  Again, this is coming from experience.  This isn't like I read a listicle.  This isn't I read an article.  This isn't I talk to my buddies that are in the space.  This is these are my pros and cons from experience.  So let's talk about the pros of low ticket.  And by the way, if there's any pros or cons that you can think of  that I miss, please, by all means, drop them in the comments.  OK, so here actually start with the cons, because then we can end on the pros.  So the cons of low ticket, number one, lower retainers.  OK. And by the way, once again, luckily for you guys,  if you stay on this call, you don't have to take crazy notes  because we're going to create a digital resource  that's going to give you most of this information  that you're going to be able to go and have access to and keep forever.  So stay on this call.  But I'm going to go over these really quick.  So number one, low retainers.  There's not as much meat on the bone.  OK, if you're doing a tow truck deal  and it costs one hundred dollars to go and tow someone's, you know, car.  How much money could there possibly be for the business owner?  Well, they got to pay for their truck.  They got to pay for their gas. They got to pay their driver.  They got to pay their insurance. They got to pay for their uniforms.  By the time it's all said and done, if they actually look at the cost,  they're probably barely making 20 bucks on that deal.  So then if they split that with you, then what?  Every lead you're making 10 bucks.  So you do the math.  If they're on a hundred dollar deal, if you're making ten dollars,  they can share a hundred ten dollars with you.  How many leads do you actually need to get them to charge five hundred dollars,  which is not that much money? Right.  So there is low retainers, typically speaking.  Most often, it's low retainers.  Number two, again, this is my experience.  You can judge. You can call me a hater or whatever.  The business owners in these niches, not always,  but a lot of times are not as a business savvy.  They just don't seem to get it as much as the other niches. OK.  And I believe personally, because it's such a low buried entry  that people could just go start a cleaning company.  I mean, we",

    "pageContent": "could add window washing, right?  That's another niche that's low ticket.  And I've also tried literally today.  Lane, Mr. Benson Boone, by the way, I'm not hating.  I love the freaking cut.  I told Kyle, by the way, you do look like Benson Boone, so keep rocking it.  Lane today could go and drop over to Home Depot, buy some whatever.  No one even checks.  Buy some cleaning supplies.  Buy whatever a squeegee and a bucket.  And he could literally today.  Technically, he should go get a license, but technically he could.  If you want to go start knocking on doors today  and he could start a cleaning company, a window washing company. OK.  Awesome. That's really good.  The problem is anyone could do that.  And a lot of people do that.  And so in my experience, you don't get that many business  savvy people, because business savvy people look at the opportunity  and they go, hey, if I'm going to start a business and I can start  a window washing company or I could start a rank and rent digital  real estate company, huh?  Well, this one I could travel the world.  This one has crazy margins.  This one's usually a business savvy person isn't going to choose that.  OK, so in my experience, you're not dealing with as savvy.  I mean, especially towing.  I'm just going to say it.  Like I've dealt with some absolutely tough people in towing  and they just don't understand like what it is to put money into a business.  And get a return.  And it's it's really frustrating. OK.  Number three, con.  You're competing against what feels like a million other marketers  for the same leads.  I know in your head, you're like, well, low ticket should be low competition.  That's what I thought.  And it actually happens to be the opposite.  Carpet cleaning is one of the most competitive freaking niches out there.  If you don't know that, go try it.  It is very, very difficult in most markets to get a carpet  cleaning website to rank on Google.  And when I say competitive, I mean, cost per lead, how hard it is to rank,  how many competitors, et cetera.  Carpet cleaning. And that's not worth that much money.  There's not that much meat on the bone in carpet cleaning.  OK, so you're competing with a ton of other people.  Number four, you need to consistently.  Aaron, check the.  Yeah, you consistently need to produce  much more volume to satisfy the business owners.  OK, you need to just so many more leads  because there's not as much meat on the bones.  What about number five?  Low ticket requires just as much work as high ticket,  but you don't get charged near as much, right?  That kind of goes hand in hand with the lower retainer.  Number six, retention.  In my experience, retention is very difficult.  And you guys have probably heard this, if not experienced it.  But when you have clients that pay you a little bit of money,  they have big problems.  The people that pay you the least amount of money  always have the most amount of questions, the most amount of  they're the most high maintenance.  And I don't know why it is. It's bananas.  Actually, I do know why it is.  It's because that little bit of money means everything to them.  And when you go deal with big clients,  they're used to stroking ten thousand dollar checks.  They're used to spending, you",

    "pageContent": "know, having a  check that just came.  They need to write for a hundred thousand dollars in some cases.  And these amounts don't scare them.  But when you deal with these small guys,  five hundred bucks a month is terrifying.  That's that's a heaven forbid.  That's a cell phone bill.  That's another car payment so I can look rich. Right.  OK. And lastly, guys, and I know there's other ones  and you guys can drop them in the comments.  But it seems like a lot of these lower ticket niches  depend more on the GBP.  If you guys don't know what the GBP is,  that is the section at the top of Google.  Again, I'm going to go very basic for those of you that are new.  GBP is the section at the top of Google.  That is the map section.  It used to be called the GMB.  It was also called the three pack.  It's also called the map pack.  It's probably going to be called something else.  GBP Google business profiles.  Tow trucks heavily rely towing heavily relies on maps.  In my experience, carpet cleaning heavily relies on maps.  Locksmith and guys from experience, from literally needing my locks  change at my at my house, I went to the maps and called the first company.  Like that's what I did. Period.  OK, so these these lower ticket niches seem to rely on the GBP.  And as you guys know, the GBP has become harder and harder to get.  Whereas these bigger niches, they don't they don't they don't they're not as much  because people are going to do a little bit more due diligence.  They're not just going to be like, yeah, I need my foundation  or paradigm and I call the first person on Google Maps.  They're going to look at the website.  They're going to do a little bit more due diligence.  They're going to make sure that like it looks credible. Right.  So these are the cons.  Now, there are a few pros.  Number one is a lot of times there's higher volume,  a.k.a. there's more leads available.  So when you're getting a deal and you throw on ads,  as long as the CPC is not too high, you're going to see the movement quicker.  Right. I remember having a tow truck website when I first started to do my strategy.  I was seeing leads come in every day.  Sometimes five, six a day.  And it's exciting.  And you get that little rush and that little dopamine.  You're like, oh, leads are coming in.  And I'm going to pass. I'm going to pass.  So that's good. OK, that is fun.  It's exciting.  So that's a pro. We're not going to deny that. OK.  Another thing that's nice about low ticket,  it's very rarely brand driven, very rarely brand driven.  I would wager to bet  you know, most of you guys, if you needed to get your windows washed today,  maybe, but I would doubt you would know like the top two companies in your city.  And if you do, it's probably because your cousin or your brother has a window  washing company. But apart from that, you don't know any massive companies.  You don't know. And it's because it's not brand driven. Right. OK.  Another another pro is the leads.  Oftentimes, but not always.  I wanted you to remember not always, but oftentimes the leads are cheaper  to acquire with paid ads. OK, again, not always.  But if you go and you",

    "pageContent": "look at like the cost per click on towing,  it's usually almost always just a couple of bucks.  It's not if it's above five bucks in towing dog.  That's it. That's that's rough because the money is just not there  to spend that kind of money.  The margins are there to kind of to spend that kind of money. OK.  So typically the leads are cheaper to acquire with paid ads. OK.  And lastly, as a pro is there always seems to be tons of business owners  to talk to. That's a kind of a negative thing because you have a lot of competition,  but it can be a positive thing because you have a lot of people to pitch  a lot of potential customers because it's so low.  The barrier to entry is so low. OK.  So that is low ticket for you guys again to review.  That's like carpet cleaning, towing, pool cleaning, handyman, locksmith,  window washing, pressure washing, gutter cleaning,  not gutter installation, gutter cleaning. OK.  These are just some examples of in fact, I'll add these  so we can add them to the sheet.  So we added pressure washing.  We added a gutter cleaning  and we added window washing just so you guys have some examples  for this digital resource we hand out. OK.  OK. Now let's talk about the.  Pros and cons of high ticket.  OK. And actually, before I do that.  And by the way, I've got about a few more things.  I just got a few more things to share that we're going to go to Q&A.  I want to tell you guys quickly about my first deal.  It's a two minute story.  Just so you guys get an idea.  So my first deal was towing huntsville dot com.  The website is still in existence.  It's awful.  It's hideous and it's hilarious, to be honest with you.  In fact, I don't own it anymore.  I've actually sold it since.  That's how much I don't like towing.  But if you want, it's towing huntsville dot com.  You guys can take a look at it.  It's in Huntsville. It's towing. OK.  I had I knew nothing about towing.  I didn't know any of the pros. I didn't know any cons.  No one told me the pros and cons.  If someone would have told me what I just told you guys about low ticket,  I never would have gone into towing.  I just heard people talking about towing and the group that I was in,  the program that I was in, didn't really give clear direction.  And I was like, dude, towing sounds good.  Let me just build towing. OK, why not?  So I built the site.  By the way, this is back when before I knew that you could pre-sells  before you could cheat the system and get a deal and have them pay for it.  But I was doing the slow method.  I built a site. I did the SEO.  I got lucky because I didn't even know what competition was.  It was just dumb luck. I swear to you, it was just dumb luck.  And I started getting a couple of leads.  And after sending these leads to a couple of different business owners,  I finally got somebody on the hook and I gave them way more leads  than I should have, like two weeks worth of leads.  Probably gave them like 30 leads, maybe even more.  And I did at the time I was doing door to door sales.  I was like in person, like in person is the best.  So I literally went to this tow truck",

    "pageContent": "like site.  If you guys have been to towing sites, it's like it's like where they murder people.  It's like a chain link fence.  There's literally dead bodies all over.  I'm kidding. But they look like that.  They have this usually a shitty little office.  And it just screams like money laundering. Right.  Like this is just kind of the vibe.  But I pulled up great Honda Civic in my door knocking uniform.  You know, when inside guns ablaze and do it, I actually put a deal together.  I got a six hundred dollar per month deal, made all the mistakes in the book,  set the expectations wrong, didn't met the business owner, didn't do auto pay.  Imagine the guy cut me a actual physical check that I walked out.  I was like, and I got a physical check for six hundred bucks.  It was like one of three checks that I got over the next six months  because I could never get into pay. OK.  As a side note, just to be fair, that six hundred dollars,  that first deal blew my mind.  It was euphoric, even though it was not the greatest deal.  And the reason why is because it was the first time that I saw  that this actually could work for me.  And I want you guys all to know that that I know you're sitting on this call.  Not all of you, but maybe some of you, maybe most of you, maybe all of you.  And you're sitting there going, yeah, that's cool, Nick.  It's cool that works for you.  It's cool that works for Ryan Dalton.  It's cool that it works for Juan Finesse and Eugene Song  and Patrick Rowland and Jerry Ward and blah.  But but but I'm different in my situation is different.  And I want you to know that we all feel like that.  OK, we all is as cocky and arrogant as I was when I started thinking,  who the heck is that guy? If he can do it, I can do it.  I had that thought.  But at the same time, there was that little bit of doubt, like,  I don't know, man, maybe I'm just not cut out.  Guys, I didn't know.  You have to understand, I did not know that  a domain was the WWW dot.  I didn't know that that's what it was called.  I just thought it was called a website.  I didn't know what SEO stood for.  I didn't know what a backlink was.  I didn't know that there was a way to write content.  I didn't know about Weebly or I sure didn't know what hosting was.  I thought that's what you did when you brought someone over to a party.  I didn't know anything.  Tracking numbers, I knew literally zero.  Like the extent of my technology, I think I had an Instagram account  that I kept deleting during the summer when I was selling  because I was distracting.  I like four posts on Instagram.  That was the extent of my social media presence and my online  technical experience. OK, so I just want you guys to know  when I got that first deal, it was like, oh, my gosh, I can do this.  And even though that deal wasn't the greatest deal,  I still remember walking out with that check, being in that Honda Civic.  It's like a million degrees in Alabama.  I'm sweating when I call my dad and I'm like, Dad, I just got this deal.  And I explained it to him perfectly.  And he's like, I could tell he was like, is this legal? ",

    "pageContent": "Like, this is a little sounds a little little sus.  You know, that's kind of the vibe. He's super excited for me.  But the thing about it was I was so pumped  because I at the time was trading my time for dollars.  And many of you guys, if not all of you guys can relate,  unless you punch the clock, you aren't getting paid.  Even if you're a salesperson, unless you are physically present,  you are not getting paid. And I was that person.  I did that for four years, knocking doors in the heat when I was sick,  when I didn't feel like it, when my marriage was having problem,  when my kids weren't well, I had to go out and get my mind right  and put in the hours or else I didn't eat.  And on top of that, I only got paid once.  I didn't get paid every month for these deals.  I got paid one time and then I had to do it again.  So that was I just want you guys to know that first deal  you guys are in for a treat.  And I would love to go back and unexperienced everything  that I've experienced and all the deals and the millions.  I promise you that first deal, it might have been sweeter  than the first million I made.  And I seriously mean that. It was amazing.  So I got my first deal in towing.  Now, the problem is I didn't keep the client.  I kept the client for six months, but I only got paid for like three  because it was like every other month they were not paying.  And I ran into a ton of the common problems  that you're going to run into.  So we started at a flat fee and then he wanted to go to pay per lead.  And me being stupid was like, sure.  And then we started highlighting, well, this is not a lead.  And I had to listen to phone calls.  And I realized his his call answering team was very rude, very unprofessional.  They weren't even trying to close deals.  And then we I mean, I spent so much time to get the six hundred dollars.  OK, long story short, I lost the deal.  OK, and I I think I signed one more guy and then I lost him.  And then finally, I signed a deal with a guy, a great business owner,  signed it, got a contract this time, did it on the flat rate for 500 bucks a month.  And I sold the site. I said, I'm getting out of towing. Done.  OK, that was my first deal.  OK, let's talk about high ticket really quick.  Pros of high ticket.  Let's talk with cons of high ticket. OK, here's the cons. Number one.  The competitors that you do have sometimes can be behemoths.  These can be titans of industry.  These can be 100 million.  And I don't I'm not joking.  These can be 100 million dollar companies that you're competing against  with marketing companies that they bought just to service their companies.  OK, these are the kind of you're going to get some high level people.  Not always, but it can be the case.  OK, so that can be a con.  Number two, if you pick the wrong city in high ticket,  you're screwed because it's almost always more competitive than low ticket  in terms of ranking.  I guess I wouldn't say always because low ticket is weirdly competitive  in some of these niches like carpet cleaning.  But if you don't get the city right, you are screwed.  It is going to it's going to take",

    "pageContent": "you all of your energy, all of your time,  all of your margin, all of your resources to rank that website.  And by the time you write the website,  you could have built five more in a better niche in city.  OK, so you have to.  I'm going to call it a con.  You have to there's no room for messing up.  You have to nail the city.  You need to know the right city, what it looks like, what the process is.  And I know some of you guys are in, I think.  So Lane, I saw a few names.  I'm not even looking at the picture, looking at my notes right now.  But a few of you guys just hopped into digital landlords.  I want you guys to focus very, very, very, very, very heavily  on the due diligence process because it matters.  OK, number three, in high ticket, the CPC tends to be higher.  OK, so you have to really do a lot of due diligence at times  to make sure that you aren't getting in over your head  and you're going to be spending too much money.  And guess what? Because the CPC is higher, your SEO matters that much more.  OK, when you're in low ticket and you're in towing, you know,  I've gotten deals before where it's a thousand dollar deal.  This is a real story. Thousand dollar deal.  And I could spend three hundred dollars on ads and I get a ton of leads  and I can make a seven hundred dollar profit split.  Boom. And some of you guys are going, why wouldn't I just do that?  Well, because the truth is, all the other cons, in my opinion,  don't make it worth it. OK, but I have done that.  And I literally did this with a towing site,  which is funny because five seconds ago, I said I got out of towing.  I got out of towing until I met a neighbor in my own city in St.  George that his or her son did towing.  And it just made sense for me to do because I already had the client.  OK, so I pre sold the client, basically.  So I do still have a towing site.  It's in St. George. And that's what happens when I first started.  I had the thousand dollar deal.  I ran the ads until it ranked. OK.  But the CPC will be higher in low and high ticket.  OK, the CPC will be higher 90 percent of the time.  So you really have to do your due diligence, as I said,  and SEO matters that much more.  So you need to nail the SEO because your margins  aren't going to be as good in the beginning, typically speaking.  So you're going to need to make sure that SEO hits. OK.  And lastly, another con that I believe is a con  is because these business owners are more educated,  you need to be sharper.  You need to know a little bit more what you're talking about.  You need to be more prepared. You need to be more polished.  You need to go in with a sales script.  You need to you don't.  It doesn't mean you need to have 15 deals.  And you need you don't need to have sales experience at the gate.  But you need to be scripted. You need to be prepared.  You don't just show up on a phone call with somebody that runs  a 10 million dollar company doing foundation repair  and think you're going to get the deal.  These guys are sharp. OK.  And they get hit up by vendors.  What I'm going to call us vendors, marketers",

    "pageContent": "all day long.  And so it's not the same as talking to Tommy, the tow truck guy,  who, like, is just not that smart. OK.  So I think it could be a con because it's a little more intimidating.  But I think overall, it's a pro because, oh, my gosh, I feel so much more.  What's the word edified after talking to somebody  that runs a 10 million dollar company than talking to Tommy,  the tow truck guy who does not just try to survive.  OK. And that's maybe that's bad.  Maybe it's not pros of high ticket. OK.  This is what I want to focus on the pros of high ticket.  Number one, we can charge fat retainers.  When I scaled the 20 in 2020 to 100K, I focused on high ticket.  OK, we could charge fat retainers because there's more meat on the bone.  It's plain and simple. OK.  Number two, this kind of goes in line with the first one,  but you don't need as many clients, meaning you don't need to manage  as many clients and as many problems and whatever.  You can manage a lot less to make a million dollars.  You don't need near as many clients with the high ticket niches  near as many deals to get to a million dollars a year.  OK, it's really not near as many as you think.  And one thing that people don't understand.  And I'll say this as a side note, is if you get a thousand dollar deal.  OK, which let's say that's your first deal.  It's it becomes this thing.  You get your deal and you kind of there's there was this moment with students.  And they're like, oh, my gosh, I just got the first deal.  And all I have to do is get 83 of those, which some  you might think that sounds a lot like a lot.  But when I had no money in my head, I was like, wait, that what I just did.  I'm making a thousand bucks a month.  You're telling me if I just do that 82 more times,  because 83.3 is times 12 is a million.  If I just do that 82 more times, I can become a millionaire.  I can a millionaire defined as making a million dollars.  I can have a million dollar business, dude.  I had a clear path to get there.  And so what I thought was I needed 82 clients, 83 clients.  But what I didn't realize is that I could go into higher ticket niches.  I could charge 2000. I could charge 5000.  And I also didn't realize that if I went after high ticket niches,  there's bigger there's bigger fish out there that you can chase.  That if you do a good job for, they are going to grow with you.  They are going to they are going to want to dominate an area.  And I had a client, I had two clients, one of them ballooned  from like a couple thousand bucks up to like eight, eight K per month.  And I had another client that started at a thousand dollars per month.  I accidentally called this client in an accidental niche because it was a lead  that came on the site in the wrong niche.  And I'm like, let me just call whatever.  And that balloon from a thousand dollars per month flat fee deal.  And one of the months that I was with them, they stroked me a $30,000 check.  So I'm telling you guys this because you sit there and you're like,  I only have a",

    "pageContent": "deal. I need 83 of these.  No, you don't.  You need to go and do brick by brick by brick.  But realize if you just take care of your freaking clients  and you'll do a good job and you'll deliver and you'll focus on providing  a service that's really, really good.  You're going to have clients that going to balloon into five, 10, 15, 20,  sometimes $30,000 clients, if you have a $30,000 client,  dude, you're you're over a third of the way there with that one client.  Now, there's other conversations.  I don't love having clients that have that much control over my business.  But at the same time, that's something you need to realize.  OK, another pro, this is what I also said.  They're more educated, they're more savvy.  You need to be sharper, which could be a con.  But also you just it's more exciting.  I love getting on and I'm talking to a business owner and they're doing big things.  They're making 10 million dollars a year.  That's somebody I want to know.  I want to know somebody.  I want to have conversations.  I want to have a Rolodex full of people that are millionaires.  And so for me, that's fun. That's exciting.  They get it when I'm talking about marketing and I'm painting the vision.  Hey, you're in Dallas and we're going to go to Fort Worth.  Then we're going to go to Arlington and work me and you.  We're going to dominate.  We're going to monopolize this area and they could see the vision  and you could see the vision and you could see your paycheck could be  and they could see the upside.  That's fun. That's exciting.  And I like that.  And you don't find that near as much in low ticket. OK.  There's three more quick pros.  Number four, you're not competing against near as many marketers.  You are competing against big dogs when you when you find competition  and if you go into the wrong city.  But it seems like the marketers, they all stay in the low ticket.  They're all terrified of low ticket.  And I don't quite understand why.  But you don't seem to bump into near as many marketers in the high ticket niches.  I don't really understand compared to these lower ticket niches,  at least in my experience, based on the due diligence process that I have  and the criteria that I have for picking a city. OK.  Second to last, you don't need to produce  near as many leads every month to keep them happy.  You can have months where you send them six leads.  And if you've set the expectations correctly, you're OK.  They're not high maintenance, not near as high maintenance,  because that's what happens when you charge retainers that are fat.  And also because they don't need to close that many deals to pay for your bill.  And they don't need to close that many deals to make the numbers make sense. OK.  And then lastly, again, this kind of bleeds into some of the other ones,  but they they they're just lower maintenance clients. OK, not all.  But if we're looking at 10 business owners and high ticket,  10 business owners and low ticket, I'm going to go ahead and put my money on  eight of the 10 of the the the high ticket are going to be low maintenance.  And two of the 10 of the low ticket are going to be are going to be high maintenance.  Unless I said",

    "pageContent": "that wrong, eight of the 10 low tickets.  I mean, you know what I'm saying?  The low tickets, more high maintenance. That's just the reality. OK.  So here's what I want to share with you.  One one last quick story about my first high ticket deal.  OK, and then I'm going to wrap it up and do Q&A.  My first high ticket deal was ironically my second deal ever.  So I got my towing deal and I just happened to to meet this guy.  I was selling door to door and I knocked on his door.  He wasn't interested at all in my my alarm.  I was selling alarm systems. He's like, no, no.  And I looked at his truck and I was like, what do you do for work, dude?  We had this weird rap and he did this thing called foundation repair.  And I was like, you know, I'm from St.  George, Utah. We don't have we don't have I'm sorry.  That wasn't foundation repair. It was a different service.  It was called crawl space.  It was called crawl space encapsulation. Right.  So we we where I'm from, it's only foundations.  It's it's just slabs. OK.  And so I never even knew what a crawl space was.  I was like, what crawl space? What?  And he started explaining to me this model and he even took me.  Imagine, guys, I'm in Alabama.  I'm supposed to be selling alarms. I'm tired of it.  He takes me in his crawl space.  I'm like, you know, this is like out of a murder scene.  He takes me. I'm supposed to be selling.  I'm like one of the the the managers.  And imagine I'm sitting in a crawl space like, look, let me tell you,  look how much cooler it is.  And it's I'm laying in a crawl space with this guy.  I don't even know. And this is where I swear to you,  they hide dead bodies in these things in movies.  And I just had this idea.  I'm like, dude, I do marketing on the side.  I'm actually like I'm completely like just blowing smoke.  I'm just acting like I'm way more important than I am.  Like, I think I could get you some leads.  And he's like, let me call my partner.  So I'm pitching him right there on the spot.  He calls his partner's name Ben.  And he's like, hey, I'm with this guy.  He walks out the side. He's like, hey, me and Ben want to take you to lunch tomorrow.  And I'm like, OK. And I'm like, see you tomorrow.  So I go home.  I will do all the research I can on this niche.  By the way, this was highly competitive, but I just went for it.  And I went I met these guys at Texas Roadhouse.  I still remember exactly what I ordered because I walked away.  I couldn't even eat. I was just too nervous.  And I went in like an absolute dummy.  And I pitched them at give me a thousand bucks to build a site.  And then let's do a hundred dollars per lead.  I didn't know paper lead.  Again, I didn't have a group like this.  I didn't have somebody like me telling me don't do paper lead.  But I went in a hundred bucks a lead, a thousand bucks up front.  And they shook my hand and gave me the thousand dollar check.  And I walked out and I felt euphoric. ",

    "pageContent": "Again, got a thousand bucks.  I'm the best salesman ever.  But again, this basically just fell into my lap.  It was by chance.  Here's what happened, though, guys.  It took me 14 months to rank that website.  I didn't know I didn't run ads.  I didn't know I could run ads.  I didn't know any of that took me 14 months to rank this website. OK.  And I think about how stupid that is.  I could have ranked three, four websites.  I could have got to ten thousand dollars a month by the time.  But I did it.  And I got it ranked and I plugged along.  I did the SEO and I made the mistake of doing the paper lead model.  And thank goodness these clients were actually good people and they were honest  and they were actually good closers.  And that's so rare.  So I actually did make some money from this deal.  And what ultimately happened is what always happens is it came down to like,  what's a good lead? What's not?  Oh, this is a duplicate lead.  What do we do about those?  You didn't answer the call.  So is it my fault or your fault?  And there became a little bit of that.  And on top of that, it became ultra competitive.  And my website, it was so much work to keep ranked  that it ultimately didn't become worth the squeeze anymore.  And so in both cases, in my low ticket example, my high ticket example,  I don't have either of those deals to this day.  Now, those were eight years ago.  And it is what it is.  But those were kind of like my extremes, like at the towing is at the low end  of towing or the low end of the low ticket.  And then the foundation repair is at the high like end of high ticket.  OK, here's what I learned from doing both.  OK, number one.  And I think I just barely said this exact same thing,  but I want to just recap on it.  But in both in both cases, I don't have a client, as I said.  And so the problem was, guys, is the low ticket.  Well, hold on one second.  Let me make sure that I there's one thing that I wanted to cover first.  They don't want to skip.  OK, no, I covered that. OK.  So what I'm going to do really quick, again, we have about 12 minutes.  If you have questions,  I'm going to cover one last little thing here.  But I do want to if you guys have questions on high ticket, low ticket,  drop them out.  And then in two minutes, I'm going to go to Q&A. OK.  But just one last thing of what I actually learned.  A couple of things I learned.  Number one is not all low ticket niches are created equally.  OK. And what I mean by that as a side note is low ticket that is recurring.  Can work.  Pool cleaning.  I have a pool cleaner at my pool in the US.  I pay 130, 130 bucks per week.  OK, so 130 bucks per week times that by four.  That's five hundred and twenty bucks a month times that by 12.  That's that me.  I'm worth six thousand two hundred and forty dollars to my pool cleaner  every single year.  And he does not.  And he also charges me for chemicals on top of it.  And literally he comes. It's like a 15 minute appointment.  So he spends an hour.  He literally spends an hour a",

    "pageContent": "week.  He spends four hours a month with me and he makes sixty two hundred bucks.  It can work if it's recurring. OK.  Other thing is super high margin.  Low ticket can also work.  OK. Duck cleaning is a good example to get your ducks clean.  We're talking, you know, small houses is less.  But let's say five hundred to eight hundred bucks.  OK. One time deal. OK.  It's something that you should do every like six months.  Supposed to do it.  Typically, I haven't even done it at my house.  But these the margins are insane.  It's like 90 percent profit margin.  So the numbers can actually work.  OK. And thirdly is when I say not all low ticket niches are created equally.  Is low ticket does not always mean low competition, as I already stated.  In fact, some of the niches like carpet cleaning, low ticket is the most competitive.  OK. On the flip side, not all high ticket niches are created equally.  There is such thing as too high ticket, too high of ticket items.  OK. And what I mean by that is if you get too high a ticket, for example,  roofing is high ticket, but it's so high ticket, there's so much money in it.  Solar. It's so high ticket.  There's so much money in it that it's branded.  People are spending tons of money on branding.  People are spending tons of money on marketing.  And it costs a lot of money to rank your website, get leads from paid ads,  get leads organically.  And on top of that, these companies are spending so much money on branding.  It's hard to get leads from a generic website.  So the key is, guys, there's a sweet spot with these niches.  And it's this sweet spot between, you know, it's kind of like the city location.  Or sorry, the I'm sorry.  It's niches is kind of like the city side, right?  So with the city side of the location side,  you don't want to just have the highest population,  but you also don't want the lowest population.  You want the lowest population with adequate search volume.  That's the sweet spot with niches.  You don't just want the highest ticket,  but you want the highest ticket that's doable for you to rank.  That's not so competitive.  So there's like these sweet spots with this picking the city.  And there's a sweet spot with picking the niche.  OK. And so you want to make sure it's high ticket,  but not too high ticket.  It's high enough ticket.  You can charge a pat retainer,  but it's not so high a ticket that it's that it's attracting these behemoths.  It's not attracting these huge, huge, huge companies.  This branding, the billboards, the ad, the commercials, the TV commercials, etc.  OK. And one more side note on the, you know,  high high ticket niches aren't all created equally with high ticket niches.  Like roofing, sub niches can work.  OK, I saw someone put plumbing.  I don't like plumbing.  It's it's a little too competitive for me.  However, the sub niche does work.  HVAC changeouts, very competitive,  but there are sub niches that can work off of that.  OK, anyway, so that said, guys,  lastly, I just want you guys to remember that on top of just picking  like the you know, how high ticket it is,  because that's what we're talking about.",

    "pageContent": " You have to keep in mind that for me to go into a niche  has to fit other criteria as well.  Number one, I still believe in going into tried and true niches,  boring niches until you get to a point where you have, you know,  retired, gotten out of your job.  So that's number one.  Number two is I still believe that has to be phone driven.  Number three, I still believe it needs to be an unbranded niche.  Right. It shouldn't be like a picture niche where people need to see  a ton of your work.  And I also believe that it should be recession resistant.  OK. And I just want you guys to know, as we get into Q&A here,  that if I were starting over tomorrow, I would be looking at niches  that fit those criteria and that are in that sweet spot  in terms of high ticket there.  They're high ticket enough is probably the way I would describe it.  You don't just want to go in the most high ticket  because now you're attracting competition.  That said, guys, as I told you one more time,  if you guys are on this call, we're going to do like  eight minutes of Q&A.  If you guys are on to the end here in five minutes,  we're going to screenshot everybody that's on  and we will get you a digital resource with an outline  of all of the notes from this presentation that is super digestible.  And you guys can basically not take notes on it.  So let's see what we've got in terms of questions really, really quick.  And then also, if if we don't have any questions,  I can start breaking down some of these niches and, you know, yeah, your name. OK.  OK, Tara Wally says Tara Wally said the Senate is going to hope  you can still send me the PDF and a link to the recording.  Could you also talk about home  interior renovation in terms of the average ticket?  I'm not sending the recording.  Sorry, but yeah, Aaron can send you the the resource.  And the reason I'm not sending the recording  because I don't want it passed around.  I want to reward you guys are actually on this call.  Bravo poll says thanks in advance.  Can you drop example of high ticket niches?  Like, yeah, I think you said that earlier.  We did that.  Yeah, those are all high ticket  concrete tree service.  Yeah, masonry can be high ticket fencing.  Artificial grass. Yeah.  Who else was that you, Aaron?  Yeah, yeah, like they're just like we listed there.  You got any more? Yeah, I mean, I mean, I know this is this works  in some areas is you're talking about some niches like roof repair  can be less competitive, but still high ticket.  But yeah, that's one that you want to some niche and very specific  with the location and the margins on roof repair are good  because it's just basically labor.  Makes sense. But no, it's a good point.  Todd says, would you do air duct cleaning or duct cleaning as a keyword?  Dude, I do both.  And I'd look at the keyword research, but those my list.  I know when I built my keyword list, my core keywords,  I think I had both of those in.  I would just look at your keyword research, see which one gets more volume.  That's going to be your main keyword.  That's going to be the one you want to use in your H1.  It's going to be the one you want you want to use your page title.  So",

    "pageContent": "that's hopefully that answers.  Laura says the sales cycle factor into your low or high ticket, Nick.  Yeah, some, but like I don't ever go into high ticket.  Laura, basically what she's asking is if it's like a super long sales process,  for example, when when someone's getting their foundation fixed,  they're going to have a longer sales process than your tow truck.  Right. If I get if I'm broke down right now, if I go outside  and I got a flat tire, I got to get it fixed right now.  Right. Like I could take an Uber.  I might be able to get it fixed tomorrow.  So I got to get that thing to the shop. Right.  I mean, they're calling a tow truck or a mobile tire guy.  And funny enough, I'm not fixing it myself.  Just so you know, that's why that's not an option.  That's immediate foundation repair.  It's kind of a decision like the foundation needs to be fixed  and it needs to be fixed soon.  But today or next week isn't going to necessarily change anything.  So it is nice to have those lower sales cycles,  but it doesn't change what I choose to go into.  Keep in mind, as part of my process,  I send them leads.  I don't wait for them to close a deal.  I send them leads.  I don't even necessarily wait for them to give estimates.  I just send them leads so they can get a feel of those leads. OK.  Lane says, I'm starting in concrete artificial grass.  Can you go into artificial grass a bit more?  I'm having trouble finding says, yeah, OK.  So artificial grass is a great niche.  That's why I like it. Lane is because.  It is, I believe, recession resistant.  We have cities like Vegas that are saying you have to have artificial grass  for turf by this date, you know, or else.  I'm sure California, if they haven't already, is shortly behind  because that's how California is.  They're professional at implementing these kind of like like paper straws,  which, by the way, are the worst things that have ever been invented.  Anyway, that said, artificial grass, just so you know,  is the niche I used in 2021 to so 2020.  My niche was tree service like my my core niche.  Twenty twenty one was artificial grass.  And I loved the niche because I got I was there was deals.  I was charged twenty five hundred bucks a month.  Like the numbers just work right now.  The key, like like you're saying, is finding the cities  because artificial grass isn't everywhere, right?  You know, there's people that need concrete in every city,  but there's not demand for artificial grass in every city.  And so that's the key.  And so what you also have to realize with artificial grass  is you're going to probably have to go through more cities  and be a little bit more strategic.  You're going to need to do more front end work to find that one city.  You might have to look at 50.  And I'm not kidding. This may sound overwhelming,  but you may have to look at 50 cities to find the one.  But when you find the one, it's going to be a home run.  And so it's kind of like, do you want the work on the front end of the back?  And in my experience, I know when you're first starting,  you want to get that first deal.  And so sometimes you go into the back end work so I can get the money  and I can get",

    "pageContent": "excited and that's OK.  But where I'm at, because I've closed so many deals  and I've dealt with so many clients, I'd way rather do 50 due diligence  and then go into the right city.  So also, Lane, shoot me a message.  I know you're inside of our program.  So I'll send you some other ideas as well.  And if I could even say, Nick, real quick on that from my experience  that when approaching like number one, just make sure you have the right keywords.  So like you want to have that.  We talked about this, obviously, in the program, but make sure you have  the keywords have the most volume because you want to do variations.  Just look, there's not only one keyword because some might get more volume  than others. And then also, when you do, whether you're so much  a good planner, like if you can also use strategy to help you  create the keywords for each city, but you can do bulk inserts.  That really helps you rather than just doing one city at a time.  Love that. In fact, Aaron, you should make a video on that  for our group and digital.  Also, by the way, Lane, search inside of digital landlords  for artificial grass keywords.  And I've posted like the keyword, like I've already done the work for you.  So you can look it there.  OK, let's say like two more questions.  Where does concrete sit in verse high versus low?  Concrete's in that sweet spot.  That's why I love it so much.  The thing you're going to run into is it is going to be more competitive  in the sense you're going to run into more marketers.  Doesn't mean that there's not deals.  And you guys go watch my YouTube videos like I've created like three.  Just because you see a marketer or a lead generator  doesn't mean you can't go into it.  You just treat it like another website.  But you are just know you're going to see other marketers.  OK, that's just the reality.  But it fits in that sweet spot.  Amy says, agree, Costco implemented paper straws.  That's crazy to us boycott Costco. Kidding.  Todd says, EG, like Minnesota, my home got some Minnesota folks on here  and do not go in Midwest for artificial grass.  No need. Yes, that's completely true.  Artificial grass. Just be intuitive, right?  Like Phoenix. Vegas, St.  George, I have a St.  George artificial grass site.  I got my grass done at cost.  I've made I make a thousand bucks a month.  It's great. It's not even that big of a city. Florida's good.  You know, it's getting more popular.  That's what I like about it, is it's trending more popular.  And I think it's resistant.  It's recession resistant because of the laws, not because people are going to go,  oh, I don't have much money.  Let me just get artificial grass.  But because of these, so I think you need to consider all these things.  But yeah, Lane, just shoot me a message.  We've got some more ideas, too, because there's just tons of niches out there  that I think you could tap into.  So awesome.  Aaron, did you already do a screenshot of everyone that's on this call?  I did. Beautiful.  I don't know how we're going to get it to Discord user  because I don't know who that is.

How many we have on there? Like 10, 15.  I'd rather help five people like deep.  I'd rather go deep than wide.  And I think you guys should take like just pay attention to what I'm doing there.  And what I'm doing here is that like I would rather you guys go  and get five clients and take super good care of them and grow with them  and dominate with them and expand to three, four, five deals.  You're going to get to your million dollars way faster  than if you're getting a deal.  You're getting the credit card, you're slamming it through  and you're handing it to your VA and you're just chasing the next deal.  Deep is always better than wide.  And so anyway, thank you guys for being on.  We're going to be doing this every Monday.  Watch for the teaser post on Sunday.  And the people that commented, the people that are active  that I could see in the group that are getting deals that are sharing wins,  they're going to get first priority on these calls.  So thank you guys.  We will see you next Monday and watch in your inbox from Donnie Dre  for the digital resource.  Thanks, guys.",

    "pageContent": " First and foremost, I'm going to record the video.  Guys real quick, what I want to do this year and especially, well, not especially, but  just in general this year is I want to be, you know, we have our structured Tuesday lives.  I always come prepared.  I usually spend about an hour-ish preparing just for that Tuesday live.  But there's a lot of stuff that I learned, a lot of stuff that comes to my mind, a lot  of stuff that I'm learning as I'm trying to scale to a million dollars a month that I  think you can take and you can bring down and extract the lessons and extract the principles  and learn a lot.  Not to say that I know everything, not to say that I'm the only one that knows how to  do business.  In fact, I probably don't know how to do business that well at all.  I'm humble enough to admit that.  But I do want to start sharing those things with you and sometimes I have this, you know,  I have this big running list of like ideas of lives I want to do.  So I'm going to change that a little bit.  If I have something that I do or that I've learned or that's working for me, I'm just  going to come live and share it and then leave it.  And if you guys see it, great.  If not, no worries.  But I want to start doing more of that.  So happy Monday.  This is completely random this morning as I was, you know, I have my Monday stuff I do  every single Monday that it makes my entire week more productive.  I was doing that and I thought, you know what, this would be super instructive and I think  very important and useful for people to hear.  So Cindy says, can you can hear you?  Happy Monday.  Cindy, thank you.  And my comments are only shown up on my phone, so I'm going to be, you know, going from here  to here.  Adair, what's going on?  Glad to have a couple of people on, but I'm going to leave this live in the group so people  can see this later.  But really quick, what I want to share in the next like literally five, seven minutes  is something that I do every single week, specifically every single Monday that allows  me to get a ton of stuff done.  OK.  It's something that I've perfected over the years and I think it's a very it's a system  that's worked really well for me and I just want to share it with you.  OK, so I'm the type of person that I like to sit with my headphones on, undistracted  phone off like the one of the reasons I like being in Dubai or Africa is because I'm so  far ahead that by the time people can even wake up, I've already got a lot of that like,  you know, that important work, the working on the business, not in the business stuff.  I think it's very valuable where I can sit with my thoughts and solve problems and then  create solutions for my company.  However, sometimes I get a little bit too extreme with that and I end up like not utilizing  what I have, the resources that I have.  OK, so obviously within your business, you have different forms of leverage, right?  Some of like, for example, there's money is a form of leverage.  Media is a form of leverage and humans, human capital is a form of leverage.  So what I want to just share with you really quick is how I how I get a lot of stuff done  throughout the week.  Actually, I get a lot of stuff done Monday through Wednesday.  I",

So I want to share really quick.  OK, and maybe we may do a longer live that I can actually show you guys my screen.  Nick Cudlick, what's going on, dude?  Hopefully St. George's warming up.  Good to see you guys on.  So, guys, here's what I do.  Every single Sunday.  Now, I haven't been great at this at this this year, but it is something that I am  like, no questions asked.  I'm going to make sure that it is it is a non-negotiable for me  because I'm going back and looking at what were the years I did the best?  What's the years I grew?  I grew the most.  What's the years that I scaled the most?  And what was I doing?  OK, one of the things was I was very, very adamant about month  weekly planning on Sunday and specifically early in the morning  before kids were up, before church, before any of that kind of stuff.  I was very, very disciplined about getting my planning done.  OK. Now, what it does, guys, when you get your plan.  By the way, this isn't a planning topic I'm talking about.  But when you do that weekly planning, first thing in the morning,  you know, when you're thinking, hey, I got to do my planning at 630 a.m.,  it doesn't really encourage you or inspire you to go out on Saturday night.  Right. That's one thing that I've learned.  You get to bed a little bit earlier.  You start thinking, hey, I got to get up.  I got to get that done. OK.  I like to do it in the morning because by the evening, I'm tired.  My creativity is gone.  And on top of that, you know, it's like I, you know, I want to be  I want to give myself a chance to reset.  So first thing that I do, guys, is Sunday morning.  I plan out my entire week.  I have a live that I've done in this group on my weekly planning,  how I do my weekly planning, which you guys can go and you can find.  You can check out. OK. So do that on Monday.  Sorry. On Sunday, Monday, what I do is I set aside an hour.  OK. And sometimes I break it up into 30 minute chunks.  I'll do like 30 minutes. I'll take a five minute break.  I'll do the other 30 minutes.  But what I do, guys, is I have all of the human capital  that I have access to, OK, which is my team. Right.  So just some of the people you guys know, Francesca, Ashley, I've got  Isaac, who is my video guy, I've got Porter.  These are members of my team.  This is my human capital for you guys.  You may have your VA.  You may have your content writer, whatever, whatever, whatever. Right.  And for me, just so you guys know, I also have  my team members that report to me that have their own team members  that report to them, which is another layer of leverage.  So what I do is I have a simple Google document and I title it  2025 weekly priorities and I put the name of the person.  So 2025 weekly priorities, Ashley.  OK. 2025 weekly priorities, Isaac.  And guys, what I",

I, you know, my big three that I do, and you guys have to watch my weekly  planning live to understand what I'm talking about.  But I look at my big three things I want to accomplish.  And then I look at all my other tasks and I look and say,  what can I get off of my plate, but still keep moving the needle forward?  And there's things that I personally have to do.  I have to record a podcast.  I can't really outsource that because I'm the one doing it. Right.  But I can outsource the planning.  I can outsource maybe not even the planning, but I can outsource the  the production and the schedule of the post and the commenting  and making sure all of everything's dialed in and editing that I can do.  So I look at my weekly priorities and my weekly planning.  And I'm going to start assigning stuff to different people. Right.  Ashley, this is this falls under her role.  This falls under Francesca's role.  This falls under Porter. This falls under Jason.  This falls under, you know, my guy, Peter here in Africa.  And I start divvying this stuff out and I put it into two categories.  OK. First category I do is stuff that they need to work on.  It's like creative juices.  I need you to put your this is this is the priorities,  the stuff that actually takes, you know, brain power and creativity.  That comes first.  And then underneath that, I call it the managerial stuff.  That's hey, I need you to reschedule a flight for me.  I need you to make sure this is posted stuff that doesn't take a lot of time.  I need you to respond to the Facebook or the YouTube comments,  stuff that doesn't really take a lot of thought, but that needs to be done.  So each one of my team members, I have two different categories.  I have my creative needle moving stuff and then I have my managerial stuff.  And I go and I line them out every single week on Monday.  First thing that I do, exactly the things that are priorities.  And as long as I've communicated the goals of the company,  the way the direction that I want to move as a company and the vision for the company  and then they can see the weekly priorities, I can then go.  And as soon as I've done that, what I'll do, you know, once they wake up  or once I get a chance is I'll hop on with them for, you know, five, 10, 15 minutes.  Like as soon as I get off this, I'm about to hop on with Francesca.  I'm going to hop on with her.  We're going to buzz through it really quick.  And I'm going to clarify anything that she may have a question on  or anything that I want to make sure she really understands.  And then she goes to work.  So for all of Monday, for Monday at 9am for the whole week,  she's completely lined out and she's on her freaking business.  She's doing the task. She knows what's important.  She knows she needs to spend her time.  And then also, guys, there's Francesca calling me right now.  I'm also, well, I then I can go back to work on the stuff  because I have two different categories.  I have the stuff that's needle moving and creative, et cetera.  And then I have the managerial stuff that's like, get the tax paper",

Let's figure out how we can create better lives.  Let's figure out we can redo this training.  Those are my needle moving activities.  And so, guys, I do this every single week.  I line them out in their Google sheet.  I try to do a quick phone call, a quick Zoom call with them.  Some of the team members that it's really cut and dry do this, this, this and this.  It's a lot of the same stuff every week.  I don't need to do it.  And sometimes and some of the people I have to get on a Zoom like Francesca,  who keeps calling me, by the way.  She's like, where are you at?  And I make sure that we're on the same page.  And guys, by doing this, you're duplicating yourself.  You are then lining your team members out.  It's like you're programming.  I don't want to say a robot, but you're programming human capital  that you're like, hey, do this, this, this and this.  And you also have a very, you know, creative and strong brain.  And these are my team members are really, really smart.  Otherwise, they wouldn't be on my team.  I wouldn't allow them to be on my team.  And then they get to go and work on the stuff  that is going to move the needle in those departments.  And then guess what? On Friday, they send me a quick loom.  If we don't zoom and they say, hey, here was this priority.  Here's what I did. Here was this five minute loom.  Put it on to speed.  Watch it in two minutes. Done.  This right here, guys, is something that I do every single week.  So I've already done my weekly priorities for all my team members,  my human capital.  Now I got to do a couple of zooms and check in with them.  And then I'll be checking in on Slack and stuff midweek.  And then by the end of the week, we either do a quick phone call, zoom,  or they send me a loom via email.  Everyone on my team member sends me a loom on email or Slack.  I then Monday morning or when I'm planning, I watch it quickly.  I'm like, boom, they got everything done.  And on to the next week, guys, this has allowed me to get a lot of stuff done  leveraging human capital, which is something you're already paying for.  If you're not taking the time to line up your VA and tell them  exactly what they should be spending their time doing and the priorities  that they should be, you know, the things they should be prioritizing.  You're leaving a lot of money on the table.  And there's a lot of stuff that could be getting done that's not.  OK, so that said, guys, in lieu or in the same vein of what I'm talking about,  I'm going to hop on with Francesca.  We're going to go over our priorities and I'm going to keep cranking out work, guys.  Happy freaking January.  It's one of the greatest months to do deals.  And I will see you guys tomorrow on the live.  I'm out. See you guys.",

    "pageContent": " When doing due diligence, what are the ideal numbers  when looking for backlinks and citations, et cetera?  Okay, so as part of the due diligence,  you guys have probably noticed,  and we've talked about this in the training,  that one of the things you're gonna look at  is how many backlinks do your competitors have, right?  And you can use this, do this with other tools,  but that's the wrong question, Jaylen,  and I'm gonna tell you why.  Not because you said anything wrong,  but because it doesn't matter how many backlinks they have.  What matters is the quality of the backlinks that they have,  and I'm gonna explain it like this.  If I were to offer you, say, 100 links from whatever,  random directory sites, whatever,  or I would give you one link from Forbes,  which one do you think would help you more, okay?  I would take the Forbes one all day.  Why?  Because unless one of those 100 is some crazy site,  unless one of those 100 is entrepreneur,  that Forbes article is gonna hold far more weight  with Google than 100 of these little ones.  Going back to the social example,  you being friends and homies with the quarterback  or with the student body president holds far more weight  than you being friends with all the ninth graders,  if you're a ninth grader, right, that are no-namers, right?  And again, we're just talking  about some stupid popularity contest,  but that's kind of what this is.  So it's not about how many, it's about the quality.  So what you guys need to make sure you're doing is,  yes, how many backlinks they have,  but the backlinks they do have,  how are, what are those backlinks like?  Are those good backlinks?  Do those have domain authority?  Do those have trust flow?  Do those have citation flow?  These are all things that we're gonna be getting into.  So it's not an ideal number of backlinks,  but what I look for is I'm looking for people  that are ranking, that have no backlinks is great,  but maybe they have three or four backlinks  and they are no follow-back links,  which we'll get into in a later video and into the training,  or there do follow, or there do follow backlinks  that have no juice or they're no follow backlinks, okay?  And they only have a couple of them.  So I, the question, how I wanna answer this,  it doesn't, it's not about how many,  it's about the quality.  And if they have 10 backlinks that have zero trust flow  and a little bit of citation flow,  I don't even view that as a big deal  because I can go and get one good backlink  and I'm gonna beat their 10 crappy backlinks  that maybe are no follow-back links  or maybe don't have any juice.  So amazing question.",

It depends on are you running smarter search like Jeff's talking about right now. What niche are you in was your I mean there's a million things.  I've seen the leads come in in, you know, lead slash forms come in, literally in hours, and I've seen some that take two weeks, and it's because of you know there's no impressions because it's a weird time of year or I didn't realize it was freaking  And I'm running concrete ads and oh that makes sense and I what's ice storm no wonder no one's calling about concrete. So that's really loaded question but if everything's dial, it can be anywhere from a couple hours to, you know, I'd say 10 to 14 days.  But as long as is you know if you're getting impressions, you just have to reverse engineer if you're getting impressions but not clicks.

And this is supposed to be live training, I tried to go live, I'm in London, hotel Wi-Fi  is crappy, so I'm just gonna record this, and then if you're watching this, it's because  it was posted.  I apologize, couldn't do it live.  That's how the cookie crumbles sometimes, guys.  So let me pull up my notes really quick, I want to make sure I'm not missing anything.  This is something, guys, what I'm gonna talk about today is something that I wish, I truly  wish that somebody would have told me and would have allowed me to do, would have encouraged  me to do, but that was not the case whatsoever, and I'll kind of get into what I mean by that  here in just a second, okay?  What I'm gonna talk about today is something that literally has made me, you know when  people say it's made me millions of dollars, and it just sounds cliche, this has actually  made me millions of dollars, I can definitively say it has made me not one, not two, multiple  millions of dollars, okay?  So let me start by saying this, guys, I grew up, let me get all this stuff out of my way  because I want to put my elbow here, because I grew up in a household and in a family and  in a community where I was taught that you should let your actions speak for themselves,  okay?  I was taught that you didn't need to talk about your success, you shouldn't talk about  your success, you should just do, okay?  Which I do respect, and I get, but that was how I grew up, okay?  And I'm guessing that a lot of you guys, because I know a lot of you guys and I've talked to  many of you, probably the majority of you I've had a conversation with, and I know you  guys grew up in similar kind of circumstances and similar kind of ways of growing up, okay?  And so I want to just talk about this for just a second, and for the record I just want  to mention that I do appreciate how I was brought up and I learned a lot from it and  in many, many ways I agree, okay?  However, I have to make a point, and we have to remember that the world is also different.  The world is very different than it was, you know, when I grew up in, let's say I was in  high school and I was 12, let's say 20 years ago, you know, the world 20 years ago compared  to today is not even, it doesn't even resemble, it's not even close, okay?  The world wasn't near as noisy, one, and attention wasn't near as valuable.  We live, and I know this kind of sounds like I'm stealing this from Gary V, because he  always says this, but we literally live in an attention economy, and the people that  make the money are the ones that know how to get attention and they convert it into  money, and that wasn't the case back then, okay?  So I don't fault my parents or anyone that grew up around me that was always encouraging  me not to talk, not to get attention, to lay low, to let my actions speak for themselves,  and that's just the advice that I was given, but I want you to keep in mind guys that as  of course our parents and the people",

Alright, when I first started in 2016, this is nine years ago, I had the biggest scarcity  mindset in business, okay?  To the extent, guys, that I remember going through my Facebook friends and I thought,  you know what, anybody that's in my Facebook friends, that's in one of these rank and rent  and digital real estate or digital marketing groups, I'm deleting them as a friend, I don't  want to know you, I don't want to talk to you, I don't want you looking at my page and  seeing what pages I've liked, and then you can maybe find out my niche and you can see  that my clients are friends with me, and that's literally the way that I thought, and I remember  literally sitting there one day, and I went through, and anybody that was a friend that  had a mutual friend with a few different people that I knew were part of this other group,  I just deleted them, gone out of my life, don't care, don't want to talk to you, don't  want to, I wanted to be a fly on the wall, and I was that guy that would be in the group,  and I was consuming stuff, but I was very, there was no producing, there was no value  being added, it was just consume, go in, lurk, get out, okay?  I didn't interact, I didn't post, I didn't share, and I only came in the group to ask  questions when I absolutely had to, okay?  And that was how I was, that was 2017, 18-ish, okay?  Probably up until about 2019.  Somewhere along the line, this is where we're going to get into what I want to share with  you guys, somewhere along the line, I started noticing, you know, I heard people point this  out and they talked about this attention thing, but I started noticing people that were like  really taking off, and we're talking about the, you know, Grant Cardona, I don't know,  from like 2012 to 2020, he had this tremendous, still very relevant, but had this huge run,  and he was, you know, very captivating and polarizing, and I watched him, obviously Gary  Vee, and then I remember watching just somebody like Jake Paul, this is 2019, 2020, and just  people were like, that guy, he's kind of a clown, but that dude knows how to get attention,  he's a genius marketer, and I was like, yeah, they're actually right, this guy knows how  to get attention, and so as I saw this and I saw what he was doing, Jake Paul was taking  his attention, he was getting attention, he was turning it into, in the case now, since  2020, 2019, he was turning it into fights, where he'd go, you know, create these fights,  he'd get a bunch of people to view it, and he was making millions, and he still is making  millions and millions of dollars, and so that was when I realized like, there's something  here, and I'm missing something, and yeah, it's embarrassing, and yeah, I didn't grow  up like this, and yeah, you know, I'm",

Guys, doing this, I did this for two years, all of 2020, all of 2021,  it did not make me any money, like it didn't make me $0, so imagine every time I wrote  a post, let's say it took me 30 minutes to write a thought provoking, not a thought provoking,  an experience that also was thought provoking post, I wasn't seeing",

But I guess just deep down, I knew that it was gonna be worth it, so I kept doing it,  kept doing it, kept doing it, again, 2020, 2021, and guys, by the end of 2021,  that all changed, because I was getting so many messages from people,  not even just following me, but people were literally sending me messages, hey, how you  doing this, how you coming up with the price, how you getting the flat fee deal, how'd you do the  pre-sale, how'd you do 10,000 a month, how did you do this, and I was answering all the questions  that I could, but I knew that I was just drowning, because there's no way I could keep up with all  of it, so that's when I started putting everybody in a free Facebook group, and just sharing what  was working once, and letting everybody consume it, okay? And so, what ended up happening from  that, and this is where I made my money, and I'm not saying that your journey's gonna be the exact  same, but you guys are gonna be surprised at the different opportunities that are gonna be there,  if you guys will build a following, if you will create influence, if you will  make yourself an authority in this space, and in this group, and I'm literally giving you the  platform, I'm asking you to do it, I'm allowing you to do it, and it sounds like funny, but  I was never part of groups where they let you do that. Every time I would make a post,  it's like, what are you trying to do, what are you trying to sell, I'm like, I'm not trying to sell  anything, I'm just trying to let people know what I'm up to, and trust that I know what I'm talking  about, because if I end up doing something, I wanna have people that have seen me, that know me,  that trust me, okay? So guys, I put all these people in a Facebook group, I've been doing this  for two years, making these posts, people have been following me, and I realized based on the  feedback, and the questions, and the DMs, I was like, people need what I have, people wanna know  how to sell, people, you know, yeah, there's a million courses out there that teach you how  to rank a website, there's a million courses that teach you how to get leads, and a lot of them are  good, but most of these people do not know how to sell, they do not know who to call, how to call,  what to say, how to overcome objections, how to send a screencast that's gonna eliminate the  objections, how to close, what happens if, they don't know any of this stuff, and this is the  stuff that I'm good at, this is stuff that I've been perfecting, guys, for, you know, for two years,  I mean, more like six, but two years just grinding it out, and so what I ended up doing is I ended  up saying, you know what, I'm gonna start a program, this ended up being Digital Landlords,  I'm gonna start a program, and I'm going to start with a beta group, and I'm gonna take a certain  amount of students, and I'm gonna take them, I'm gonna train them, I'm gonna do everything that  can give them the best service I can possibly give them, at a discount, because they're taking  a risk with me, because I have no credentials, I have no, you know, case studies, whatever,  and I'm gonna go",

Guys, that first day,  I made almost 100,000 bucks, I was like 97,000, literally, I don't know, I almost made 100,000  bucks in that very first day. Now, why do I tell you that? Because that all came and that was all  possible because I built influence, because I built a micro following, I didn't know what it  was gonna look like, I didn't know if I was gonna do a program, I didn't know if I was gonna do  consulting, I didn't know if I was gonna do anything, but I spent the time, I made about  10 posts in 2020, I probably made the same in 2021, I answered people's questions, I was active  in the group, I spent time in the DMs, not a lot of time, but I spent time, and I just started  building my brand as Nick Wood, as somebody who owns this agency called Evergreen, and I started  building this little micro following inside of this really unknown niche called Rankin Rent,  inside of a few Facebook groups, just by sharing my story, just by sharing my wins,  sharing a few losses, commenting, giving my input, sharing a tip here, sharing a strategy,  that's all that I did, guys, and literally made on my very first day when I decided to monetize  this, I made 100,000 bucks, give or take, let's call it 95,000, and literally some of these people  had just seen a post, and that's it, that's it. So what I'm telling you guys to do, guys,  and I'm encouraging you to do, and what I'm suggesting you do, and by the way, I apologize,  I'm kind of trying to talk a little bit quiet, I can hear somebody's outside cleaning,  I",

Now, the hard part about  this, guys, is that you're not gonna see the money immediately, you don't even know how it's gonna  work, you don't know how you're gonna monetize it, you don't know if you're ever gonna monetize it,  but I will tell you guys that it will be worth your time, even if you don't end up monetizing it,  because I think eventually you will, but even if you never do, it's still gonna be worth your time,  so here's, and my goal was initially, because I was gonna have Porter on this call, I was gonna  have him share his thoughts, because I had this conversation with Porter when he first started,  he was really being quiet, he wasn't sharing a lot, he grew up in the same household as me,  don't talk, don't, whatever, whatever, whatever, and he's even more conservative and, what's the  word, not the same, like he's even more reserved, I guess, than I am, I wanted to have him share  his experience, and I was like, dude, you gotta share, you gotta share your posts, you gotta share  your wins, and you guys don't have to do it in a braggadocious way, you don't have to do it in a  loud manner, like I sometimes come across, I know, I know, it's annoying, but here's what I'm asking  you guys to do, okay, asking you, number one, first of all, you gotta fix your head, you gotta  create an abundance mindset that you know that sharing is not only not gonna hurt you, but it's  the single best thing you can do for yourself, you're building authority, you're building a  micro audience inside of your community, or inside of here, inside of the free Facebook group,  inside of the school community, but you have to have an abundance mindset, you have to realize  that sharing is not gonna hurt you, okay, it's not gonna hurt you, in fact, it's going to help you,  period, okay, again, I'm not only letting you do it, but I'm asking you to do it, okay, so here's  what I'm suggesting that you do, is what",

Maybe at a future date we'll set up a call-only ad for  specific reasons, but today we're going to do website traffic with a call-out asset added.  With that, we're going to go ahead and begin here. So I fold up my MCC here. We were going to set up  a new sub-account. You can see right here in sub-account. So when we pull up our MCC, we go down  here to settings, okay, and we pop that tab down right here and you can follow down along. It says  sub-account settings. You can see the sub-accounts right here and then I click the plus sign right  here and I go to create new account. Okay, so today for the training purposes, we're going to  go through, to follow along with the training, we're going to do Bentonville Concrete today.  So we're going to go ahead and set up an ad for Nick's Bentonville Concrete site. So I go here and  I set this up. I say Google Ads account. It's going to give you these two options. You want to choose  Google Ads account. We go down here and so for Arkansas, I want to choose their time. I believe  they're closer to Chicago time and currency. There you go and that's it. Click here  and confirm you're not a robot and save and continue. That would be the first step in setting  this up. This is going to ask me to confirm it's you. Sometimes they do that and there you go.  Looks like that was good to go. We'll go ahead and do that again. If that happens to you,  sometimes it just sends it to like your YouTube or to your Gmail. Not really a big issue.  Okay, so we have these things set here. This is your payment profile. You should already have this  set up. We've set that up for you in the training. If not, you can go up here to tools and training  or tools and settings and there is a billing area right here where you can  set that up under settings. I'm going to hit submit.  Okay, so with that, now it's going to bring me back into my sub accounts here.  You can see them right here and here is our new one Bentonville Concrete. We're going to click here  and it's going to it's thinking and it's going to come up and it's going to we're going to start  setting up our campaign. Okay, so it wants us to set up our new campaign right here. You can either  click the button right here that says new campaign or you can go down here to set up a campaign.  So I'm going to click right here and set up a campaign and then a lot of this should look  familiar with the initial training for the students that have been here for a little bit,  but if you're new, this is fine. This is just the new one that you're going to be getting.  For today's ad, we're going to be doing a website traffic ad with the call out added. So we're going  to click right here to website traffic and then here it's going to give us the different types  of campaigns. You can see all the ones that Google wants to give you or at least for options.  Google wants to give you or at least for options, we're going to select search.  Okay, and then we're going to do our",

    "pageContent": "website. So our website today is going to be Nick's  Bentonville Concrete. You guys should all be familiar with that through the training.  I think in the second version of training, we'll use Queen Creek Concrete, but these are the these  are going to be the same things. When it asks for your conversion goal, I just like to keep it simple  and do a page view. You don't need to set up conversion tracking at this point. This is fine.  So then it's going to ask you to name it. You can you can create whatever name you want.  I'm just going to do search ad Bentonville Concrete. Okay, when you go here, it's going to ask  on to turn on enhanced conversions. You can do that if you want. I don't because I don't like  to share everything with Google, but that's there's nothing wrong with leaving that selected  there. Okay, and then we're going to go to our next screen. Okay, so the next step in setting  this up, it's going to take you to the bidding, right. And so for bidding, its default is  conversions. I recommend and would tell you guys to go and do clicks rather than conversions.  When you start out a new campaign and you do conversions, it will Google will spend all of  your ad budget and sometimes up to three times your daily ad budget. So you want to start with  max clicks, especially for the first three or four months of an ad. So we're going to go here,  we're going to select clicks. Now the next step it's going to do is it's going to ask you  to set a maximum cost per click bid limit. You can see right here, it starts off as a default  where it doesn't ask you that. But while we're setting this up, we're going to go ahead and  we're going to click set right here. Okay. Now at this point, some of you are going to say, well,  I don't know what it is. And that's fine. So we're going to go to the next step,  which is using Google Keyword Planner to help set those CPCs. So with that, I want to show you guys,  some of you are using SEMrush. You can see here that I use Mangles. They're both great tools.  There's not really a huge difference between them. It's just that I use Ahrefs for a lot of  my SEO stuff and it doesn't work great for our local SEO. For Mangles, it's just a cheaper plan  and I like using it. It also gives me the ability to more easily search over certain cities for  keywords. So I go here. I type in my main keyword is concrete contractors over Bentonville. I get  good search volume and as you can see here, there's no CPC. But I'm not really worried about that  because I know that there are people running ads there. But it just gives me some seed words and  some other things to look at. Okay. From there, what I do is I get my main keywords. So we're  doing concrete contractors. We kind of know what those keywords are. But if you were running  artificial grass or spray foam or something like that, you want to have your base list of keywords.  And that's important in your initial keyword research with SEMrush or Mangles.  And I'm going to show you why that's important here. So we're back to our ad. We're going to  use Google Keyword Planner. Now, I don't want to lose my progress right here. So I'm going to go  to Tools and Settings. I'm going to click the wrench right here. You go all the way to the left  in the planning column. You go down",

    "pageContent": "to Keyword Planner. You want to right click and you want to  say open link and new tab. And you can see up here that it's open that right here. Okay. So I'm going  to say I want to you can see right here. It's got an active account. Okay. I'm going to click there  and it's going to ask me for what keywords I want to use. So for keywords that I want to use,  it's going to be concrete contractor. It's going to be concrete driveway, concrete patio.  We'll experiment with concrete company as well. Okay. So we're going to run those four keywords  for right now. You can run like four to six in here. It's not a huge thing. And then right here  where it's always going to have a default of whatever home country you're in. But right here  with the little old Google Maps sign, you want to click on where it says the United States.  And what we're going to do is we're going to deselect that and then we're going to choose  our location to target. Okay. Now this is not necessarily going to be our  this isn't necessarily going to be our main place to set up where we're going to run our ads at.  We'll get to that in a different step. This is just to set up and get an idea of what  the CPC will be for running ads over that location. So they're related but they're  separate things. So you can see here I have it selected. It's running it over Bentonville.  I could add other locations but it's really not important at this phase. We're just doing research  on CPC here. We go down to here and I say get results. Okay.  And here we go. So it's going to give us our our stuff here.  And this is interesting. We are getting no CPC here. Very interesting. Very limited CPC  for Bentonville, Arkansas. Okay. So sometimes that's going to happen. When we have here we  have concrete contractor, concrete driveway, concrete patio, concrete company, concrete  patio, concrete company and then you have the added near me. We'll talk about this when we  set up our keywords later. Concrete repair. So there's a little bit of search volume but not a lot  which is interesting. I think you guys on Simrush are getting a lot more than what I'm seeing here  right now. But we can see that in concrete there's near me. You can see a low bid and you can see the  top of page high bid. Okay. So when you set up your main keywords you want to kind of scroll  through this column and you want to pick up your top of page range for your CPC.  And this in this case the top of page bid for the one keyword will be $11.45 which I know is higher  than what we recommend in the training but when you're running search campaigns you have the  ability to be more of a ninja and getting your ad displayed when people do different search queries.  So what we want to do is we want to go back to our campaign here and we're going to set that maximum  CPC limit. I like to do one penny ahead of what I see is the highest limit.  With that we will do another additional live at one point where we will discuss what to do when  you have a lot of variations between the top of page high bid. Okay so once I do that I'm going to  hit next. Okay guys so after we set our our CPC limit we go to this next phase which is the campaign  settings. This is a really simple thing but it also can be a little confusing and if you go through  too fast with this you can make a simple mistake. So we want to be just on the search",

We don't want to do that so we deselect that and the other one is their display network so we  deselect that. Now our ad is only going to run on the search network. Okay all right and now the  default location is always going to be the world. Okay so we we're going to hit enter another location  okay and then we're going to start typing in. You can either type in a city or in this case  because I'm familiar with Bentonville and how the how it's kind of that city's laid out.  We're going to do like a 15 mile radius and we're going to type in Bentonville Arkansas and we're  going to do a 15 mile radius. Okay and that's going to give us this really big area right here  and that's about what we're going to do for this ad setup. Okay now sometimes if there's a lot of  bigger cities around here you and this city is like 170 and just by doing this all of a sudden  now my ad's running to three or four or five hundred thousand people a 20 or 25 dollar a day  budget isn't going to do well. So you just have to make sure that you do your research on the not  only your keywords and your niche but also when you're setting up your ad. If this was a large  city with a lot of suburbs around it I would just do that city and that city only and you do that  right here by going into the location and you just type in that city and that's where you run it and  you'll see it on the map. Okay and to show an example of that we'll just do that right now we'll  just show you guys what that looks like that way if you're having that issue. So right here I'm  going to say I just want to go over the location and I hit target and you can see it just outlines  the city limits of Bentonville. Okay and then now here if I wanted to add in these other towns I  could definitely do that I can add in Bella Vista Arkansas it's right here right I can add that in  too if I want to do that okay but for simplicity we're just going to do a radius because I know  that's going to work here. Okay so we're going to do this we're going to change that to 15 miles  and we're going to hit target. Okay so now we're back to there you can see the radius and now we're  going to hit save. Okay before we do anything else you want to go to location options right here  you're going to drop that down for the type of services that we're going to be focusing on for  lead gen we want to be presence and people in or regularly in your targeted locations okay  all right languages and typically in a default to english and keywords we'll get to there and  in more settings right here there's really nothing here this is where you can set up an  ad schedule if you want to set it up but typically in the very beginning we don't really do that we  don't really need to do that but you can get in here and set your ad schedule up later on  okay it's really simple you just hit the pencil button it'll give you the times all right we're  going to go to next okay so so now we're going to set up our keywords okay and this is going to  be at the ad group level okay so we're going to do and you can name these whatever you want but  this is just for me to keep track of this here's the website right here and you can see that they  wanted to give me a list of different keywords that they found okay i'm going to go up here  and you can",

First and foremost, I want to let you guys know that and keep, let me know where you  guys are coming from, where you guys are tuning in from.  I'm going to read them here in a second.  And again, as I said, for those of you that just hopped on, as I'm trying to figure out  giveaways, I'm going to try and keep up on the giveaways, Aaron Vogler, I hope you're  ready to take some notes because we're going to be giving away a bunch of stuff today.  But I want to see your names and why you guys did not just spam the comments, but give  some value.  Okay.  Add some value, add some insight.  That's what I want to see.  That's who's going to be getting the giveaway stuff.  Okay.  So a couple of things really, really quick.  Let me make sure I get my notes dialed in because I got a lot going on on my screen  here.  Let's see.  Okay.  Let me just tell you guys really, really quick once again.  So stay on till the end.  This is going to be less than an hour.  So we're going to try to keep it.  We are going to be giving away five coaching calls with Donnie Dre.  We're going to be giving away five coaching calls with the daddy of digital real estate,  Porter, who is just trailing behind Jason, but it's also getting his trash kicked because  Jason's beating him by like 4,000.  Come on Porter, pick it up.  You can't call yourself the daddy if you're getting beat.  Okay.  So five calls with Donnie, five calls with daddy.  We're going to get five swag winners.  We're going to be giving away these t-shirts, the OG digital landlord t-shirts, maybe given  some, I might even give away more than that.  We're going to be doing three winners of the exclusive training library, which is like,  I think it's 14 hours or more of trainings that we did that we did not put in this group.  We're just going to give you the library.  We're going to give three of those.  We're going to give away two partial scholarships, and we're also going to be giving away a pair  of the Apple AirPod Max.  So we've got a ton of stuff to go through, and we are going to be covering a lot, okay?  One thing I want to cover really quick before I bring Ryan Dalton on is if you did not already,  I want you guys to go check out my latest post, okay?  And in that post I mentioned, I said something to the extent of the Facebook group as you  know it has an expiration date, okay?  Why and what does that mean?  I'm not going to be, this isn't going to be a dramatic thing.  It's just going to happen.  I've been saying this for a long time.  People do not value what they do not pay for.  Facts, okay?  Period.  End of story.  You do not value what you do not pay for.  I don't care if it's a freaking soft drink or if it's a course or if it's whatever the  case is.  If it's a vehicle that your parents gave you, when you pay for it, you value it, okay?  That's just how it works, okay?  You get a free training session at the gym.  It's way different than if you",

So I made a post, go read it, and for those of you that are sitting there and you actually  are serious about this, we have the link in there.  You guys know what you got to do, and I think I even put in the hashtag, you pay the piper  or you pay somebody that's paid the piper, but I just want to make sure this is clear  since we have 70 people on this call right now, that if you wake up one day and the group  is no longer there or it's completely different and you no longer have access, that is why,  okay?  People don't value what they don't pay for.  So if you are somebody that's been sitting on the fence, oh my gosh, I'm not sure if  I should do it, I'm going to have to take a risk, then maybe now is the time, okay?  That's just all I'm going to say about it.  The link is there, and also, you know what I'll do to make it very simple, let me see  if I can actually do this really quick, and then we're going to get into it.  I am going to mute one thing.  One last thing here, let me copy this for anybody that needs it.  There is the link, the digital landlords link, because that's what I posted in the thing,  and no one can tell me that they didn't see it.  I think that's working, okay.  Hopefully that's working.  Yeah, it didn't work.  That's amazing.  Hold on.  That's funny.  Just kidding.  Don't follow that link.  Don't follow that link.  Okay.  That said, guys, let me find this really quick, and then we're going to be bringing on Mr.  Ryan Dalton, and it is going to be a freaking live.  Okay, where the heck is this at?  All right, where the hell is it at?  There it is.  One, two, three, copy, go back here, delete this.  Sorry about that, guys, and yeah, I saw the 404 message.  My bad.  I think that one's going to work.  Still didn't work.  Okay, Aaron, what I need you to do, that's hilarious.  Aaron, I need you to go and find the link.  Yeah, it's not working.  That's amazing.  I love that.  Well, just kidding.  It's too late, guys.  It's too late.  Okay, here's what we'll do.  Watch this.  Watch this.  All right, where the hell is it at?  There it is.  Okay, done.  Now I can do it.  If that doesn't work, you know what I think the problem is?  I think it's just too late.  I think that's all it is.  All right, let's see, paste, and yeah, there we go.  All right, should be good now.  Look at this.  We've got 86 people on, guys.  There, Aaron.  Thanks for jumping in there.  I think that should work, too.  All right, between me and Aaron, one of those suckers is going to work.  If not, then it's just too late.  Okay, there we go.  I think that should work.  Aha.  Boom.  Okay, good to go.

Let me give a little bit of a preface, and let's get into today's call.  Guys, stoked about today's call because, let me give a little bit of a  backstory.  Back in 2020, when I was, well, back starting in 2016, as I got into this  business, and I was like, hey, I got to scale this thing, I got to scale  this thing, I got to scale this thing.  As I attempted to scale this business, and I finally was able to scale in  2020, we reached $125,000 in 2021.  That was the max that we reached.  By the way, I think Ryan Dalton's going to come kick my butt here shortly,  which I love.  It's actually the biggest compliment ever.  But anyway, as I did that, guys, I built this business.  I basically felt like I willed it into existence.  I was doing the calls.  I was doing all the sales.  I did have some people, but it wasn't systematized.  It wasn't clean.  It wasn't built properly, okay?  I felt like I had this duct-taped business that was just hanging on by a  thread.  And yes, I pulled it off.  Yes, I willed it into existence, but there was a lot of mess to clean up.  After I hit that number, guys, I went into like a mental funk for like six  months, five to six months.  And you can ask Francesca.  We closed down the office because of COVID.  I was like, inaccessible.  Inaccessible, whatever the case is.  I literally had like, it was weird.  I went into this thing.  I think because I just spent so much energy trying to get to these levels.  My systems weren't dialed in.  I definitely didn't have everything in one place.  My attrition started to kick in, and I just couldn't maintain that 125K.  We were able to maintain the 100K, but the 125 we were not, okay?  I had a business.  I had built a business that only ran with me in the middle, and it was freaking  exhausting.  I had to be there.  I had to run the show.  And the fact of the matter is, if somebody had come to me at that point and said,  hey, I want to buy your business, there is no way I could have sold that  business the way that it was set up.  There's just no way.  Guys, let me just mention some of the tools that I was using at the time to try  and scale.  SCM Rush, 129 bucks a month.  Majestic, 50 bucks a month.  Ahrefs, 129 bucks a month.  Pipe Drive, Entreport, Salesforce, High Level.  These are some of the things that I've tried that worked, didn't work,  whatever.  High Level.  Spent a lot of money on High Level, developing their app, whatever.  Then we got the free stuff.  We got the Google Sheets and the Google Docs.  We got the Asana.  We got Call Rail.  That was a paid one.  We got Google Keyword Planner.  And all these tools, guys, I've never been able to confidently recommend.  Even when I built the training inside Digital Landlords, I just told people what  worked for me, but",

I didn't know where the data came from, et cetera.  And I did not have anything that I could recommend.  And that is until now.  Okay?  And so what I'm going to be doing, I'm going to be bringing on Mr.  Ryan Dalton right now, and then we're going to get into this call.  I'm going to explain why we got him on this call and what we've got for you  guys.  It's going to be a real treat.  Okay?  Okay, here we go.  Where is he at?  Ryan Dalton.  What's up, Nick?  Ryan Dalton, we got a full house today, bro.  We got 87 people ready to rip on this call.  88.  How's that sound for a money?  That's a party, man.  I love it, dude.  I love it.  Okay.  So here's what we're going to do, guys.  I want to make sure we give away some stuff really quick.  What I'm going to do, actually, is I'm going to have Jason Allred.  I'm going to have Jason Allred go through, and I'm going to have him select  based.  Here's what I'm going to do.  Anyone that's interested in a coaching call, a quick call with Donnie  Dre slash Porter, I want you to drop, say, me or make a comment that  indicates you're interested.  Okay?  And I'm going to have Jason go in.  I'm going to let him pick 10 winners so we can make sure that we're not  spending the entire time doing the giveaways, even though we're going to  give away all this stuff.  So, Jason, if you are on right now, please indicate that you're hearing  me.  I'll message him as well.  But, Jason, I'm going to put you in charge of picking the 10 people.  You'll have five that go to you.  Five will go to Porter.  Aaron Vogler says, Ryan's closing percentage is so high because of his  hair.  I saw that, yeah.  I love that.  Lean in me, baby.  I love that, dude.  It's so low maintenance.  So, again, Jason Allred, hopefully you're on right now.  I don't see him.  I'm going to send him a, so I don't have to cop off of this.  I'm going to send Jason a quick message.  And then let's get into this call.  I don't see him messaging yet.  So I'm just going to send him a message to Jason.  Hey, bro.  Can you choose?  Oh, he's got it.  He's got it.  All right.  So Jason's going to choose 10 winners.  That's going to be our 10 coaching calls with Porter and Donnie Dre.  Donnie Dre's at 13,600.  Porter's at 9,400.  And these guys are both people that have literally done this with no help  from me.  I've never closed any Porter's deals.  I've never given him a freebie.  He's done this entirely alone.  Okay?  So that said, Ryan Dalton, you ready to get into this?  Yeah.  When do you announce on the Lamborghini giveaway?  That one's coming.  It really depends if we can get a thousand people on.  No, by the way,",

Yeah, that's a totally I don't even want to know some of the things that came  to my mind when I thought about that.  But yes, a lot of Red Bulls.  Yeah, it's a lot of Red Bulls.  I don't know what's going to happen there.  So, okay.  So, Ryan, I know you're on this call.  I'm going to just do a quick little preface.  Let's get into this.  Okay.  So, guys, Ryan started a little over two years ago.  You guys might have heard the story.  You might not.  Ryan's at $87,000 per month.  Or what are you at right now?  Are you at a little bit?  $87,000.  Yeah.  I got a little bit.  I had some churn.  So I'm between $85,000 and $87,000.  We've got a couple lined up this month.  So we'll see how they go.  So basically, Ryan's on the he's on a run rate right now to do a seven  figure year.  He's already made a million dollars collected into his agency in his first  two years.  But we're talking about now he's on a run rate of a million dollars per  year agency.  And, dude, I have no doubt in my mind you're going to blow my number out of  the water, which, again, is one of it's a compliment.  So I'm stoked about that.  Anyway, Ryan started two years ago.  He wasn't in a weird spot with his job.  He loves his job.  He's got a great job.  It pays him well.  He's got a beautiful house, beautiful family, great, like the perfect  American dream life, the actual American dream.  But he realized, like, hey, well, let me go to the offense.  I'm going to go and find something that I can control.  And he did.  He did his research.  You guys will notice today when you do the call, he's very analytical.  He's a very intelligent person.  And he came across and fell into rank and rent.  Anyway, long story short, two years later, he's scaled to eighty seven  thousand dollars per month.  And this is the most impressive part, guys.  He's kept his job.  He's raised the family.  He still does jujitsu.  He still travels to Brazil.  I still see posts when he's hanging out with his kids.  And it's been amazing to watch.  As I've watched him scale, I remember I would hit him up and be like,  dude, you're crushing it.  You know, and how are you doing it?  And I remember one day because he's a very organized person, very  systematic, he's like, well, let me show you.  And he had put together like these different tools and everything was in  this very neat and organized place.  And I was like, dude, can you do that for my agency?  So he helped me out and he set mine up.  And eventually this conversation came up like, dude, you should build this  for real, where it's an actual product that you can go in.  People can just click a button and then boom, it's it's it's up and running.  And for the past 18 months, it's been about 18 months, right?  Roughly.  Yeah, yeah.  Fifteen.  But,",

A lot of blood, sweat and tears has gone into this and it is incredible.  I'm stoked to show you guys have Ryan show you guys this.  So this is I called this live the only tool you need.  And it is the only literally the only tool that I am using now.  It's going to and we're not I'm not we're going to try not to geek out too much  and overwhelm you guys.  But every single one of those tools that I mentioned, the pipe drive tool that I  mentioned that was a CRM that this does that the majestic that tells you how  many backlinks this does that I didn't even mention the SEO quake and the who is  sir like all these different tools.  But every one of these tools that I was using, this will do it.  My favorite thing just as a teaser is doing the due diligence with this tool.  The amount of time this would have saved me when I was doing this is incredible.  So anyway, that said, guys, between the search volume, the ability to buy cheap  numbers through Twilio directly through the platform, the CRM, all of that stuff,  the due diligence tool, we're stoked to show you guys this.  And again, if you'll stay till the end, we're going to be giving away a deal.  We're going to have a deal for everyone that's on this call at the end that wants to  use this tool.  I would highly recommend you say that on top of the giveaways and everything else.  So, Ryan, give us a quick we're going to just quickly do this because I know we've  interviewed you, but give us just a quick anything that I missed about your story  about why you got into this.  And maybe for people that are sitting there, they haven't even started rank and  rap.  Why did you somebody that's a very intelligent person decide that this was the  model that you just said you wanted to get into?  Yeah, man.  Well, first of all, thanks for having me on.  Love being back on the call with the art of digital real estate.  Made a lot of friends out of this group.  So hey, everybody.  Good to be on with you guys tonight.  Yeah.  So why did I get into rank and rant?  So I was looking for something that used the Internet scalable and repeatable  and was actually passive.  And there's a lot of people out there that talk about doing those things.  And this is the model that I found that actually did that.  So, you know, you put up a site, you put in the right market, you rank it, and  you rinse and repeat over and over again.  And the numbers just made a lot of sense.  And at first, I wasn't a true believer until I closed my first deal.  I was like, oh, boy, I can do this.  Like, this is this is a thing.  And then just went from there.  And he really went from there.  Guys, just to put it in context, for those of you that are new, like I saw one  of my my who is a neighbor turned to a friend, Jared Mattson.  He lives in St. George.  Jared, I started if you're still on this call, I started in 2016.  I didn't even make real money until 2020.  It took me four years to start making real money.  Ryan's done this in half the time.  And I think there's a number of reasons.  But one",

And what we're going to show them today is what was part of and is part of your  your secret sauce, if you will.  So, yeah, dude, let's let's talk about like, I think we just get into it, dude.  I think I don't.  Again, this is the only thing I'm I'm hesitant is I don't want to, like,  overwhelm people.  I just want to show them a few things.  But, guys, this like I just saw somebody like this said, does this replace go  high level a thousand times over?  Dude, go high level is built for like digital whatever.  This is literally ace.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  This is also not a go high level like white label.  There's some people that try to make some tool every now and then, and they  just like put a sticker on from go high level.  This is like this is proprietary technology made for rank and rent by rank  and renters.  So when we made this, it was by me doing the business and then going to other  people who had version one of this and said, hey, what's working?  What's not working?  What do you like?  What do you want?  And people like, you know, like Mike, we used rank and range in one point.  Oh, and, you know, I love that guy.  And he is one of the people that gave me a lot of feedback like, hey, this is  what works.  This is what I'm doing with my agency.  We built something that is made by the rank and rank community for the rank  and rank.  We're not like cobbling together all these tools from all these places where  they've got people to do SEO or people to do website.  There's a lot of general purpose tools.  There needs to be something made by our community that is doing this business  model.  And it just didn't exist.  Right.  And so a lot of people are paying like a lot of like a lot of money to put  together tools that you need, like a piece of it.  Right.  You need a keyword planner.  You need like some element of someone else's tool that is helpful for your  business, but there's a lot you don't need.  So that's what we set out to do.  Right.  We wanted to build the all in one purpose built tool for people that do this  business model by people that do this business model.  Exactly.  And the best products, let's be honest, the best products and services  always come when someone gets into an industry.  They feel the pain points.  They see the pain points and they're like, Hey, I'm going to solve that issue.  Good.  Good.  Quick example that we're going to get in and show these guys.  I'm going to use a farming example.  One of the biggest pain points in farming with Alpha Alpha.  Hey, Porter can testify to this is when you when you cut the crop, it's on the  ground, you turn it, it's dry.  You have to wait for this perfect moisture.  Right.  This perfect, the dew has to come in.  And if it's too dry, the leaves fall off.  If it's too wet, you risk it lighting on like catching on fire, sitting in the  stack.  And this company came along called Staley, Staley West.  And they built a freaking dew machine that you literally pull on the back of  your",

And they sell these machines at like two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.  Right.  Per machine.  And they're good.  They're literally selling them like eggs off the shelf because it solved such a  pain point.  But it took somebody in the industry realizing, hey, instead of waking up at 1  a.m. to check the dew temperature and then taking a nap and then checking it  again and doing this every year until you die, let's just create the product.  The best products come from people in the industry that have had the pain, felt  the pain and developed them.  So this is a rank and rent tool just for rank and rent built by rank.  I know there's other people that are building tools.  They're like, yeah, there's a rank and rent.  But you know what they're doing is they're going wide.  They're trying to get the digital market marketers that are doing SMMA and  doing this.  This is for rank and rent.  Done.  That's it.  Why?  And this is one other thing, dude.  That shows you guys how confident Ryan and I are in this in this industry.  Right.  We're not hedging our bets saying, well, if rank and rent doesn't work, we can  go to this other ancillary market or this parallel market.  We are betting our entire futures on rank and rent.  This is built just for rank and rent.  Okay.  So it is catered to rank and rent the way that we do it.  And I'm stoked about it.  So Ryan, I'm going to give you co-hosts.  I think you should just show them the freaking tool, by the way, the version  1.0, which took some setting up and, and, and, you know, duct taping some  tools together was kind of like your, your Petri dish.  You had a 100 people that, that, that did it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We had like 200 and tune.  I forget the exact number.  It's on my website.  I went and looked at it.  200 and something.  Yeah.  It's 200 and something people that built their agencies, usually 1.0.  And it was so successful with 1.0 that we decided to really polish it and make  it something that's going to be really, really useful for people that doesn't  require all the setup.  So we used to have to do a bunch of no code things to pull some things  together.  And we got rid of that, right?  We just make it point and click kind of thing.  So you want to get into it?  Let's do it, bro.  I'm stoked.  Um, by the way, this is like one of, I don't have that many bookmarks.  This is one of my bookmarks.  Now I wake up, open it up and, uh, and I can see my tasks.  Like, yeah, just show them.  I just gave you co-hosts.  So let's just get in the tool, dude.  All right.  All right.  So I'm not, I'm going to say this up front, but we're not going to show you  the whole thing.  Cause we don't have some fun stuff.  We're going to show you some things that are going to make your lives easier  and it would be more fun.  Right.  Cause that's a big part of doing this is",

We're not going to actually look at all of these cause we just don't have  time for it, but I'm talking about what all these do them to give you guys  some, uh, some due diligence.  So if you guys want to drop a city and a niche into the chat, maybe someone  can keep an eye on it and we can go back and look at some options for due  diligence.  We do some live due diligence here with you guys.  Yeah, guys, let's get some city and niche options.  If you guys have any that maybe you're looking at, or maybe you have a niche  and you want to try a different city, let's do that.  And, uh, while Ryan's getting into it and then once, yeah, let's, let's go  from there.  I'll have some people give some, some examples.  Cool.  So I pulled up a dummy account here.  Um, and I'm going to show you guys, you know, when you log in on this left  sidebar, you can see all the features and this is has what is required to do  this business model.  It allows all of your data to talk to each other in the right way, where you  have efficiency in the way that you build your agency.  So the first is this task tracker, right?  You've got to know what your goals are and you got to have at the task level  things that you're doing to move the needle, right?  It's the best way to describe that.  And then you've got due diligence.  So we're going to dig into some due diligence.  I'm going to show you guys this.  Uh, this is the work and have fun today.  We've got a site portfolio.  All your sites are in one spot, right?  You can just put all the essential things you need to know about all your  sites and what stage development they're in prospects.  You can pull in all your prospect information, what your goals are for your  prospects, your target subscription, right?  It's all right.  Phone numbers, emails, your clients, you pull it on your cloud.  I've got Michael Jackson is my client, right?  Uh, we've got client information in here.  So you've got a CRM, a lead tracker.  So you can't see any doubt in here, but you pull in all your leads.  Um, I've got a little rock concrete, all the calls, call recordings,  uh, you can, you know, annotate them with messages, goodbye tracking numbers.  And the cool thing I love about this, that I love about this is the tracking  numbers you get in rank and run engine.  Uh, you can set up automated SMS for your business owners to get a text  message when the lead comes in, which is the number one retention pool that  I can impress upon you guys.  Uh, and you've got a site analyzer, which I'll show you guys here in a  minute where you can break down your, your sites, uh, getting the SEO  information you need, and then a keyword tool to do manual keyword work.  So let's just hold on Ryan real quick, because I, we kind of brushed  over that.  Yeah.  Ryan is the master at low attrition.  That's how he's been able to scale so rapidly.  His, his attrition is very, very low.  I want you to just say that again about the number one thing that you can do ",

And that is the automatic SMS notification when a lead comes in.  So, um, this is the configuration for this number for a little bit.  This is the configuration for this number for Little Rock Concrete, right?  I don't actually own Little Rock Concrete.  That's, uh, I'm sure someone does, but, uh, you have a default SMS lead  notification down here, which basically just says, Hey, you have a new lead  from, and then it'll say Little Rock Concrete and it puts the caller's  number.  So every time that business owner has a call that comes in, a lot of them  don't answer their phone.  That's just the nature of these business owners.  They get a text message that says you have a new lead for Little Rock  Concrete.  They know it came from me.  So they don't think that, Oh, that came from my sources or someone, you  know, gave me that lead.  That wasn't this guy I'm paying for.  They know that it came from me.  And all they have to do is scroll through their text messages to see how  many leads they got in the last month.  And so that's enabled by default with a random retention.  Tell me that, like, I guarantee if that, if there was a tool that just did  that and it costs $20 a month, that people would pay for that.  Yeah.  Just that one little thing.  How many times?  I want you guys, for those of you that have been doing this, how many times  have you had business owners?  You're sending them 30 leads.  You're sending them 50 leads a month.  Even you're sending them 15 and they're, they just sound ungrateful.  And it's, it's because they're, they're ignorant.  They don't even know the leads are coming from you.  This sounds so simple, but literally as soon as I could lead comes in, it's  just that constant reminder.  Oh, that was Ryan.  Oh, that was Nick.  All that was evergreen.  And that was, and that right there will do so much more than a stupid report.  Phone call checking on their kid and it's automated.  It's done.  And that's just one tiny little thing that Ryan was basically skimming over.  I just want to make sure that you guys heard that properly.  So anyway, keep going.  A hundred percent.  Yeah.  That retention is essential.  Like that, that is, that is the number one tool that I've used to get to  87,000 a month is they get a lead.  They get a text message.  They know it's from me.  And so everything that comes in every month, I get credit for.  Right.  They're never going to question it.  And I can then use that to keep them.  If they ever call a complaint, Hey, I'm not getting enough leads.  Like, Hey, let's pull up your text messages.  Show me how many you got in the last 30 days.  Right.  And I'll count them.  I'll make them count them.  Right.  One,",

Thanks for being a great client or whatever, something goofy like that.  Right.  You can customize it.  Amazing.  Amazing.  Okay.  Sorry to stop your stop your flow.  I just had to mention that it sounds like it's just like one little piece,  but it's such a valuable piece.  So let's keep going.  Yeah, totally.  All right.  Just some due diligence.  So this is, this is what I'm like.  This is what I've been geeking out on too.  They're geeking out on it.  This was the most fun part to build.  Like I, this was a lot of hard work, but it was really fun to build this  part.  So we're going to do some due diligence.  We're going to jump in here and do some live due diligence.  And we're going to pipe in some real information in real time.  So this screen is your due diligence.  Empire mapping.  Right.  You've got to know where you're going to succeed and where you're not.  And so what we pull in here.  Okay.  So this is the, this is the, this is the, this is the, this is the,  this is the record.  Automatically when you click a button is all the things that you need to  know to enter a market.  Right.  So I'm just going to point some things out here.  You guys are smart.  You guys can probably read this, but this record right here,  let's just grab one. Let's do like.  This is a paint one.  Let's see.  Hey,  does it let you zoom in a little bit? Can you like,  Plus just to, yeah, I know it kind of skews a little.  That's good right there. That's perfect.  Cool.  Let's do a.  I got it. I got an example too. When you're ready, we can do this one.  We could do concrete contractor, Miami.  Just because everyone's familiar with concrete Miami sounds fun.  It sounds warm.  So that, and Laura's always on the call. So let's do that one.  All right, Laura.  Let's do it.  All right.  So here we're going to click add a record, right?  So we're going to add location and this top right corner.  So while I'm setting this up, we're going to need,  I'm going to tell you guys what we need. All right.  We're going to need, we've got our location, Miami.  We've got our niche concrete.  We're going to need to grab the top three competitor domains.  We'll get those in a minute.  So right now, if you're overseas,  this is only for the United States for now. All right.  We're going to bring it to our buddies over in the UK, Canada,  in Australia.  Right now it's just the U S so your country by default is going to be the  U S.  The state we're in through Florida.  Our city.  We're going to do Miami, but look, here's what you guys need to know.

You can add your own if you want to concrete contractor is a,  is a classic.  So it's already in there.  So we're going to put in all of our secondary keywords.  So we're going to put in all of our secondary keywords.  Call driven.  Just a reminder. Like it's gotta be called driven guys.  Primary keywords.  Concrete contractor.  And our school put all of our secondary keywords.  You're going to put in your core keyword list here, right?  These are your pop money keywords, right? So Sam concrete.  Press enter.

So you've got six core keywords, right?  So Nick teaches you guys to build your core keyword list.  We're going to grab some of those keywords.  Put them in here. These are our money makers, right?  These are the ones with the highest search volume.  Correct.  And then this is the Miami area, right? So a pretty big area.  We know that upfront.  A lot of active businesses, like I don't have to look and I know that.  So we're going to put many, if you're unsure, you can, you know,  Nick's taught you guys.  And me how to do your due diligence when looking at these businesses.  So you can do your competitor analysis.  But here's where the money is going to be made for you guys.  All of those manual entries that you're doing to fill out spreadsheets,  to put in your competitor domain information.  You're, you're not going to have to do that anymore.  So if I do concrete contractor, Miami.  I'm just going to grab the top three domains that I see.  So I'm not going to pull a lot of thought into this,  but I'm just going to grab the ones.  So, and let me say this while you're, while you're grabbing those.  What I, what I've been doing guys.  I have my keyword list.  So I have got my concrete concrete contractor, whatever.  I opened the five, six windows.  And before I start, I just type it in.  I type in concrete Miami, Florida, concrete contractor, Miami, Florida.  All the way down.  And then quickly, I just toggle between all six.  And I go, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  I grab the say, if it shows up in the organic.  You know,  let's say four out of the seven times, four out of the six times.  Boom. That's a top competitor.  I'm dropping it in. It takes an extra two minutes.  That's how I do it to make sure that I'm getting, you know,  the right keywords, right competitors.  But Ryan's doing this off screen just to kind of give you guys an idea.  It takes two seconds, but it takes two seconds.  Yeah, so that's exactly right.  So, you know, you guys want to go look at, you know, which,  which keywords these keep consistently pulling up for,  but we're going to pull it in those domains.  Put them in right here.

We're just going to go look at that domain and do like concrete  contractor.  Rose Miami.  Right. So it's available, right? We checked. It's available.  And the future we want to see is available.  So we're going to go to go.  Right.  So it's available, right? We checked. It's available.

You can put that in here.  Hey, hold on.  Yeah.  We're counting. Oh, it's done.  I was going to have us count, bro.  The due diligence is done.  That's crazy, bro.  Yeah. Like that. It's done. So due diligence is over for that record.  Right. So here's what we've got here, guys.  We've got, you know,  Up here.  We're indicating this is the name of the domain.  All right.  So it's the first thing that you're building it or your VA or  however you're going to do it. Right.  That's the domain I want.  Like my VA is building it.  Go build this on this domain.  Go buy it.  Right.  Here's our city. This is the DMA region.  So it's the one.  So it's the one.  So it's the one.  So it's the one.  So it's the one.  So it's the one.  Right.  Here's our city.  This is the DMA region.  So it's the wider area.  Right.  Many active businesses,  concrete contractor,  the population will appear.  DMA region.  So if you do the smaller area,  you can see what the population is,  but you're not going to need that when you do a DMA region,  because it's going to meet your criteria for sure.  Your primary keyword up here.  Right.  And then over on the left, you know,  you can change these to your low-hanging fruit.  Right.  Like yes, no.  Here's the cool stuff.  Right.  Your primary keywords.  The first thing over here on the left search volume of 1300.  I'd say that that that meets the due diligence.  I think you're safe to go into Miami concrete on the,  on the search volumes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's enough people looking for concrete Miami for sure.  You see the calls per click.  So seven 70.  For this keyword.  Right.  So pretty good.  And then over here,  your secondary keywords all appear.  So these are all of our money keywords that Nick trained you guys.  Like which are the ones that are going to be your core keywords?  They're all pulled in right here.  And we get the calls per click data that is as fresh as you can get it.

Now I want you to show the competitor analysis.  And then I want to mention a couple of things on this guys.  Well, let me say number one,  number one thing that I love about this,  it saves all the records.  How many times have you guys done a due diligence?  You'll wait three months and you think of a city.  You're like, dude,  I think I did the due diligence on that and you're looking in your Google  drive or worse,  you're somebody like me and you did it on the freaking paper and you're  looking through your folders,  your Manila folders and you're in your little cabinet and you can't find it.  So you go and you spend another 45 minutes.  Everything saved.  You can go look at it in two seconds.  So go through the competitor analysis really quick as well.  Just just quickly.  You can just show these cards.  It's crazy down here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So what do you grab these top three?  So you got to know who you got to beat to get to the top.  You want to rank organically.  You got to know how you're going to get there.  And so you can look at these top three competitors.  So you put in that domain age, you put in,  you know, you put in their domain, right?  And it's going to spit out immediately their domain age,  how many backlinks they've got, citation flow, domain authority,  page authority and trust flow.  So the essential industry standard SEO metrics just pop right to the top and  we pull in that domain.  So what we're doing is we're using a few APIs to pull that in at the same time.  So when you had to go, it all pops up at once for you.  All right.  So here's better one, two and three better.  Better two has been there for a minute, right?  They're 28 years so that they've been around for a little while.  But you can see like quickly, like Captain Miami concrete contractor,  you can beat that guy like or gal, right?  Like that is not, that is not hard to beat.  So, you know, you can get into that top three and this is what you're able to  surface really quickly when you're able to pull the data into the right spot at  the right time.  Here's another thing I like, guys.  Let's say that you're doing concrete flat work and you decide, you know what,  that you get a new client or you're prospecting a new client and the new  client does a lot of decorative concrete and you want to go and you want to  quickly look in the same city, but you want to look at some different keywords.  Show them how easy it is to quickly edit a keyword and rerun the search.  Yes.  You can just click edit, pop this out.  Like if you wanted to do decorative concrete, add your new keyword, update  the location.  Done.  And there it goes.  All right.  Decorative concrete, $2.00 a click.  I love that.  It feels good.  And that's actually hit the sweet spot, by the way.  So, guys, some people that haven't done the due diligence, like I've literally  personally done over a thousand.  I can, I can definitively say I have done over a thousand freaking, I've probably  done over 500 on a paper.  Right.  And I would like at",

And I was super stoked, but it was frying my brain.  Right.  We've been talking through this entire thing, chatting on chat.  That took us like all of seven minutes.  And we're not even locked in.  Right.  The amount of time that I have saved on due diligence is bananas.  What it allows you to do is it allows you to look at way more cities.  It allows you to break down way more cities and niche combinations to find that  perfect city.  I mean, dude, just for this, this is the thing that I've used the most and  played around the most with.  And it's just a small part.  So anything else you want to cover on due diligence, any questions that people  have on due diligence.  I saw that there's a couple of things that I wanted to address really quick.  We've got a bunch of people that I recognize in the house here.  Let's see.  Simon says Ryan, Ryan Dalton out here selling shovels in a gold rush.  You know, it's funny about that is yes and no, because Ryan's an opportunist,  but also at the same time, if you can't use that analogy because those people  only sold shovels, this would be like somebody that had the mind that was  making a lot of money, that was making the primary money from the mine and  was like, Hey, I found this shovel that works better.  You should try it too, because there's an opportunity.  So I know what you're saying.  And yeah, there's an opportunity.  We're not going to, we're going to call a spade a spade.  However, Ryan makes his money from doing rank and rent the same way that I  don't make my money from doing the program.  That's not how I made millions of dollars doing the thing, selling and  selling leads, renting simple websites.  Me and Ryan, before we ever opened our mouth about it, we made the million  dollars, the multiple million dollars.  So, but yeah, of course it's a great opportunity.  So Chris says, yeah, I'm in the mine with you.  I'm down there.  We're all in the mine together and I'm tired of having bad tools down in the  mine.  Exactly.  And I'm all about people with good tools.  And if someone wants to come with like a superior sandwich that is dust proof,  whatever, I'll buy that too.  So there's, you know, it's all about opportunity here.  Okay.  Real quick.  Chris says in this example, what stands out about those data points, good or  bad, et cetera.  Let's, let's answer that question and then let's move to a couple of their  features and then give away some t-shirts.  For sure.  Yes.  We'll breeze right through that.  There's some great training on that.  Like I got to give a shout out to Nick's training.  Like he, he dives into all this stuff.  If you're, if you're not taking that, you should, because you can get really  what these metrics mean, right?  These are the metrics that allow you to assess if you have a viable market.  So let's look at this one.  We got up right here, right?  So competitor three is Captain Miami Concrete Contractor.  So you, you have to know what it's going to take for you to beat this  website to rank higher than",

    "pageContent": "them.  That's the purpose of the competitor analysis.  The older a domain is and the higher the numbers are in those other metrics,  the harder they are to beat.  So a domain that is less than a year old.  Is way easier to beat than one that's 28 years old.  Right?  So you're able to look at these and say, Hey, am I going to be able to do  what it takes to get in those top three spots or another example?  And we're not going to go through all of them.  You could do a whole hour on just this, but backlinks, this guy has three.  Okay.  You could do three backlinks before this call in, if you know how to do  them, but this guy has 1600.  And so that indicates to me that they'd gotten SEO guy that helps their  concrete company.  Right?  So now I'm battling this SEO guy to be competitor number two.  So each of these metrics will give you insights into what it's going to  take for you to win.  And that's what I'm about.  I want to win, baby.  And I want to win fast.  And so I want to know what it's going to take to do that.  And that's what due diligence does for you.  A hundred percent.  And just so you guys know, also, this is what's so cool about Ryan having  developed this tool is like this, it's not going to be a hundred percent  perfect out the gate.  There's going to be things and we're getting feedback as we go.  We're building like adding changing.  Like one thing I think that would be really valuable.  I've talked to Ryan about is if we had a way that you could click on the  backlinks and it could open up the backlink profile, because we know that  backlinks aren't created equal there.  You could have three good backlinks could be better than 1600.  So we understand that if it's a competitive niche, you might have to go  and you have to analyze those backlinks.  That's something that we can add because Ryan is overseeing the development  of this.  So real quick, I'm going to give away some t-shirts and then let's get into  a couple of the features.  Reggie.  So what I'm going to do, Ryan, sorry, Aaron Vogler, if you're on, please  help us.  And just so you can note who's the winners here, but I'm going to give away  some t-shirts.  Reggie Klassen met Reggie in Sierra Leone of all places back in 2010.  And he's on this call.  I'm going to give him a t-shirt and you can choose which one you want.  What you guys will do if you guys are a winner of the swag, you're going to  message Aaron.  Aaron's going to send you a coupon code.  You go in.  It's completely free shipping and all.  Get your pick your size.  We'll ship directly to your house.  So we got Reggie Klassen.  We've got let's give away.  If anyone stands out to you, let me know, Ryan.  Let's.  Santos.  Santos.

You know what, Landon, just because of that comment, I think we're going to give Landon  t-shirt.  Landon t-shirt winner.  He just used the reverse psychology, the reverse.  Let's give away one more.  Mason Black says he wears large.  That's an assumptive sale.  Let's freaking go.  Mason Black.  That's t-shirt winner.  There's five.  We'll give away some more guys.  We still have to give away the headphones.  We still got to give away a couple of partial scholarships.  Let's go through a couple more things in our last 10 minutes here.  Ryan.  Yeah, for sure.  All right.  I think we saw a question earlier about data privacy.  Look, no one sees this.  We take data privacy really seriously.  I'm not in here stealing your due diligence.  I've got my own agency planned out for the next year.  I'm not in here ordering your due diligence records.  Due diligence is sacred.  It's your agency building your future.  It's building your rank and run empire.  And so data privacy is something that I'm a very like private privacy  oriented person so that we built the software in accordance with that.  We also are pulling this data straight from the pipe guys.  You're not getting more accurate keyword research anywhere else.  So let me show you guys what I mean by this.  So this is a site analyzer.  And so we're going to do that site.  Let's just grab that domain that was old.  What's that?  C E C O concrete.  All right.  So they've been around a minute.  So you go in here and see like, all right, what am I up against?  And we're going to pull all that information in, right?  We're going to do a little bit more of a deep dive.  So right here from the top, we've got citation flow, trust flow, domain authority and page authority.  Like these are the top four metrics that we look at.  And beneath them, you see our backlinks and backlinks over time.  Give us a picture of how much attention they're putting into being competitive.  So down here, you can see for the year, right, they're working on stacking these backlinks.  Like they got someone that knows what they're doing that's involved.  So that's an indication to me that that's going to be pretty tough.  Right.  And you can see another detail about their backlink information here, where they're referring, all that kind of stuff.  We're not going to get into all that, but I'll give you guys what I mean.  Let's grab this other one.  So if you want to go deep dive captain Miami, that's just a wild name.  All right.  That's like one of those massage parlor type of things.  I'm not sure that's a concrete company.  Yeah, I don't know what that is.  So this",

This is going to be easier to beat three referring domains.  You can do a deep dive and look at, hey, are they actually doing what it takes to stay in that spot?  Or can I go win?  So you can analyze all your competition.  You can see their anchor text and referring domains and all that kind of stuff that you guys are probably paying a lot of money for with fancy tools right here with your keyword planner.  This would be a majestic type of a tool, which would cost you $50 per month, just as a heads up.  Now, it doesn't do everything majestic does yet, but that's something that we can work towards with showing, you know, more of the backlink profile and going in a deep dive like that.  But anyway, dope.  Can you show them the the project management piece, which I love?  You know what I love about it?  I'll just pop in there.  Sometimes I'll see something like, for example, we have this GMB that wasn't ranking and it was in one of our locations that we have.  We're making a decent amount of money.  Oh, your screen got smooshed like this.  I think it's just maybe unshare and share again.  It looks like it's like that big.  I don't know.  Just went dark.  I don't know what happened here.  I'm going to come back.  No, try it again.  Anyway.  Okay, that's better.  I'll go in and I went in the other day and I went in.  I put like optimize GMB get three reviews by end of week and I assigned it to Francesca just to kind of piss her off because she basically runs the company and she was humble about it.  She actually didn't even say a word.  She completed the task, moved the card over and it was done.  So anyway, I love the project management task tracker is super nice, too.  Yeah, so I mean, I built this.  I've had over 3000 tasks that we've done in the last year that I write for myself or I write for my team or, you know, I'm big on knowing like what is the actual specific thing that I have to do to move the needle.  Like this is the Hormose thing.  Like what's required and I put what's required into my task tracker.  So you can see that we've got four columns.  Here's what I got to do.  Here's what I'm doing in progress.  Here's what I finished.  And here's where I'm stuck.  And that's the backlog.  Right.  So this is a pretty straightforward project management tool, but it ties in with other agents.  You're not full sheets or Trello or whatever.  You're doing it right here in the tool.  So what's our task?  We need to optimize GVP.  Right.  And then you put in your details where you need to do.  Right.  So, you know, add photos, make posts and reply to reviews.  And then you add, you know, whatever you can add images or documents or pictures or videos or whatever you need to add to like, you know, make sure that that task has the data that it needs to be completed.  Assigned prioritization.  This is very high priority.  You can add labels.  Right.  This is GVP optimization.  Probably going to add this one.  So we're going to add a new label.  Right. ",

Nick would have him and then Francesca and everybody else is there.  So you're going to assign them, you know, sub user.  I've got a sub user.  I call them that.  A task is useless without a deadline.  Right.  We're going to do this by Friday.  And then some people like to color code.  And so we just fill up this with everything that we need to do that's required.  Right.  And just chip away at it to move the needle forward over and over and over.  And then that's how the revenue comes in.  Sorry, I'm over here just trying to answer as many questions as possible.  Yeah, I know there's going to be a lot of questions that people have.  One thing that we're going to be doing is a separate Facebook group for  just people that are on this tool.  You can go in, you can ask questions.  There's going to be trainings, et cetera.  Because I know there's going to be a lot of questions, but real quick.  We have that.  Yeah.  You can join my Facebook group.  Right.  So rank and run engine is the Facebook group and you can jump in.  And if you guys want to join that, ask questions or whatever.  I think you were saying that they're asking about that kind of thing.  Yeah.  Well, like I just saw some questions that were very specific.  I mean, we could spend two hours answering questions and they're there.  Some of them are simple questions.  I just was letting them know that there is a Facebook group.  There's ongoing support, et cetera.  What I would like to do really quick though, because I do want to respect  everyone's time and maybe what we'll do is let's announce the winner.  Let's choose a winner of the headphones.  Let's give out the discount code.  I'm going to let everyone know about the scholarship and then let's stay on  for like maybe five, 10 minutes to answer a few questions and then we'll pop  off. That way people that need to go can go.  Just respect that.  Okay.  So we did the t-shirts.  What's the deal?  So what's the deal?  Let's talk about the promo for those that are on this call that join.  I think that we talked about like this will go through at least the next  24 hours.  This promo code that you're going to be giving.  Now there are a few people I want to mention this that may have been in,  you know,  my community inside digital landlords that you guys have the ability to have  you're part of our beta group.  This can they can still like kind of doubt they can kind of double dip and  get this as well.  Correct.  Yeah. They didn't sign up for beta,  which I really appreciate that by the way,  if you were a beta user and you're in digital landlords,  they helped me find kind of the edge cases to work out.  Right.  And I really appreciate that.  That meant a lot to me.  But now we're opening this up to the wider rink and rent community,  starting here as an exclusive and artificial real estate.  And we have a promo code for this group.  That's if all caps landlord 24,  we'll give you 20% off for your first two months of whatever plan that you  get,  or it'll give you 20%",

Landlord 24 all caps landlord, the number 24, right?  That man. Yeah. Yep.  Okay.  Go ahead.  Yeah.  Landlord 24 and join our Facebook group.  It's just called rink and rent engine.  We're in there talking about how to build the agency.  It's a good time.  I love it.  Okay. Two more things.  We mentioned that we're going to be doing two skull,  two partial scholarships for digital landlords.  We're going to be doing two,  two partial scholarships for digital landlords.  And we're going to be doing two,  two partial scholarships for digital landlords.  And we're going to be doing two on that because I want to actually  pick people that I think are going to succeed and have the best chance of  succeeding.  For that one specifically,  if that is something that you are interested in again,  it's just going to be two, it's going to be a partial.  It's not going to be completely free.  It's just going to be two winners.  It's going to be a partial,  but that is something that we are going to be including.  So that's the scholarship piece.  Now, as for the air, the, the Apple,  air pod max there,  I think they're like 580 bucks, something like that.  I've actually never used them, but everyone I know that has them,  loves them.  I don't know if that's cause everyone's just like.  Fanatical about Apple or not, but right.  They're awesome.  Oh, you have them. You have them. Amazing. Okay.  Okay. So there we go. So Ryan, let's,  I think we should ask a relevant question or completely irrelevant.  And based on the answers, let's pick somebody. So let's, I'm going to let you,  whether it's a rank and rent related question,  whether it's a purpose driven question,  whether it's something completely off the wall,  what question should we let people and guys,  what we're going to do is we're going to have you guys,  we're going to give you like one minute answer in the comments.  And from those comments, we're going to be choosing a winner.  Now don't be that person that fricking drops 15 comments or I'm going to not  choose you. Um, what should, what's, what's the question, right?  And by the way, we didn't come in with a plan.  We just thought we kind of go with the flow on this. What should we ask?  You know, you know what I love hearing from people.  I love hearing what their why is.  Why you're what.  A rank in rent agency. What's your reason for doing that?  That I love getting answers to that question.  I love that. So what we're going to do, we're going to take two minutes.  If you've been on this call so far,  we've got 74 people stay on for like four minutes because we're going to be  giving away these Apple AirPods. Um, we don't, we're not,  it's not one of those fixed ones. We've got somebody in mind.  We're going to try and fix this thing. Why are you here?  Why do you want to build a rank and rent empire like Ryan and I have done?  And again, it's, it's amazing. We started out with this idea. ",

Uh,  Wyatt,  like if you've got medical things,  nothing makes a man hungrier than something medical in their family.  Right.  I'm going to,  I'm going to solve this.  My wife has,  uh,  gluten intolerance,  right?  She can't eat bread and stuff like that.  It's not celiac,  but,  uh,  that,  that is,  uh,  that's the,  you gotta,  you gotta take serious for sure.  Cause she's gonna have problems later on in life.  I respect that a lot.  And then,  uh,  Katie's talking about her daughters,  I think daughter,  daughters,  two of them.  I got a little girl and I do anything for my little girl.  And so,  uh,  when you arrive home in the middle of the night,  you got medical stuff to solve.  You got,  you know,  little girl,  like those are,  those are the ones that pull on my heart.  So those are my answers for those three.  So,  um,  I vote,  I didn't even see any of those answers because it was going too fast.  But,  um,  Let's,  let's let everyone vote.  Who do you think out of those three winners?  We got Katie with her daughters.  We got Eric.  with Wakin' Up, and we've got Wyatt  with health issues inside the family.  Real quick, who do you guys, let's let everybody vote.  Who's the winner out of the three?  Katie, Wyatt, Eric, just drop a name.  Katie, Wyatt, Eric, we're gonna give,  who won the headphones, two, a couple of people,  pieces of swag, and then we're gonna get  a little bit more Q&A.  What do we got here?

I know that Eric was also looking at,  talking about a scholarship.  Message me if you guys were interested in the scholarship.  You guys can message me  with why you think you should win it.  Katie, message, Aaron, and we will get you the,  either order the headphones directly to your location  or just Venmo you the money.  You can do it for those headphones, but you enjoy those.  Thanks for being on the stream.  Eric, Wyatt, you guys are gonna win  the Digital Landlord t-shirts,  and you'll get those shipped to your house as well, okay?  Beautiful.  Yeah, Katie, Katie is the clear winner.  I love that, and I appreciate you guys with your feedback.  So let's go, let's do seven minutes.

We'll see, but let's go through a couple of questions  that we had from the actual software side, okay?  But guys, real quick, for those that were on this call,  just wanna say thank you.  We had, I saw at one point, 97 people.  That means a lot to us.  We know you guys have a lot of stuff going on,  and we don't take that lightly.  So I think this was a really awesome call, lots of value.  Got me pumped, it always does.  Every time I'm on with Ryan, I get pumped,  but we just appreciate you guys being on the call.  So just wanted to say that really quick.  For sure, yeah.  Let's see, let's go through a couple of questions real quick.  Kurt Dahlstrom has the best question.  He says, one question you have to ask yourself,  Amex or Visa?  Yeah, assume the close.  I love that, okay.  Okay, let's go.  Justin Taylor says, will there be any form trackers as well,  or just phone calls only?  I think right now it's just phone calls,  but eventually, is there gonna be form trackers?  Is that something on the list?  Is it not on the list?  Yeah, so we do forms, and then we have a lead,  like a forum for inputting the leads,  if you're the one answering the phone,  or if you're a VA, or setter, or however you wanna do it.  Piping in a form through a API call, or a webhook,  from a, like whatever one of your sites are.  Something that we wanna do.  It just is not something that is in this first version.  Keep in mind, guys, this is version 1.0.  There will be many, many versions to come,  but right now, I think for a version 1.0,  this thing is pretty darn robust, in my opinion.  Yeah, we worked really hard on it,  and the cool thing about this is,  you guys are help building this.  So this is something that, as we get feature requests,  this is not a done thing.  As we get feature requests,  we're gonna take those feature requests  that everybody's asking for,  and say, this is what we're building, right?  I have a call every week, with developer,  and you guys help build that vision,  because you say, hey, here's what we want,  and so it's still being built by the rank and rank community,  and it's still an ongoing thing  for development of this platform.  Anthem says, are the sub-users able to log in  with their own login, or do they use ours?  This is awesome.  Yes, yeah, they log in with their own.  You can have your own sub-users.  PJ asks, do we have a call tracking service,  or does this tool does that?  Yeah, this does everything voice.  This is all programmed on auto.  You don't have to use CallRail or any of those others.  It's built all right in here together for you guys.  Dustin says, would you recommend this for someone  just starting out with a couple of sites and no deals yet,  or someone that has deals already?  I'm curious your answer on that, Ryan.  Yeah, absolutely, because even if you don't have  a deal yet, you still have to figure out  where you're gonna build your",

    "pageContent": "website.  You have to figure out which market you're gonna win in.  You have to have a phone number  that's gonna put on the website.  You gotta have the tools set up to succeed  once you can close that first business owner.  This is made for everyone from,  I'm just starting rank and rent today,  to I have an agency with 150 websites like I do.  And I think too, and the question also might be  a little deeper, basically asking like,  is it worth the money at this point?  And I think, look, I think the local plan's like 97 bucks  with that discount, you're at 70 bucks.  You have to use something anyway.  You're gonna have to use some kind of tool.  Semrush is 129.  That's just that tool.  But also, I always think about this in terms of time.  If you guys haven't done due diligence,  go do five due diligence and then come sign back up  for rank and rent engine because you guys are gonna wanna  literally poke needles in your eyes.  It is tough.  It is freaking tough.  It takes time.  And from somebody that's literally done  over a thousand themselves, I swear to you,  that feature alone is worth 100 bucks a month.  Like easy for me.  Because I'm saving, dude, I'm saving 23 to 50 minutes.  I bet my first due diligence took me an hour.  So when you're first starting,  you're saving 50 minutes a rip.  You do that for the first 10, 20.  Like what's your time?  Even if your time's only worth 10 bucks an hour,  which it's not, it's worth it just  with the due diligence feature,  which is I think my favorite feature about this thing.  So yes, I think it's like that thing.  Like if you wanna make professional money,  you treat it professional.  However, if you are just completely broke,  then obviously you can go and you can hobnob it together.  Yes.  But again, look at your time and what it's worth.  And sometimes we just forget about that.  So 100%.  Quick question, Casey Patton.  This is actually Kyle's brother.  Good question.  He says, can you create-  What's up, Casey?  I know Casey.  Okay, dope.  He says, can you create recurring tasks?  Recurring tasks.  So like you put in a task and you market it complete  and it comes back up like a month later.  No, we don't have that right now, but that's a great idea.  So when you got it backed up,  yeah, join the Facebook group,  come to our Facebook group.  And then when you guys make an account,  you can actually click your little face up here  and you can click support  and you can put in a feature request.  So you just put in your feature request  and it goes straight into the same tool that I use  to work with my developers to build out that kind of thing.  So that's exactly how the flow works  to get that kind of thing added in.  Dustin says, the task tracker reminds me of Trello  with the cam band board.  Yes, it also like a type drive.  It's so easy to create that card and just drag it over.  Like I used to use Asana and that was like, it was nice,  it was so much that it just overwhelmed me.  This is like a couple of columns, boom, boom, boom.  You're done.  Let's see, what else we got? ",

Don't sign up on mobile, it's made for desktop.  So if you're trying to sign up on mobile,  it's not gonna take you to a mobile version of this.  One day maybe we'll have an app or something like that,  but it's designed for desktop.  So I got a question I think about  signed up on mobile earlier  and it's just not built for that right now.  So there's really no reason because, dude,  I don't know about you, I'm not building sites on my mobile.  Like that's just.  Oh, no one is.  Yeah.  So quick question, Landon says,  what kind of spam filters do you offer?  And I know there's something out there.  So we've got under your tracking numbers,  we have built-in spam filtering.  You can enable spam filtering  and that requires them to press one to connect the call.  So they'll have a message that says,  thank you for calling, press one to connect.  And the caller will have to actually input that  on their phone to connect the call, right?  So that's the number one thing I've used to reduce spam.  And you can just enable it by clicking with spam filtering  and update your phone number.  Love it.  I like, dude, how simple this is.  I know that there's other tools that are,  they have a little bit of overlap.  And the frustrating thing for me was that there was so much  because they're trying to cater to SMMA and SEO agencies  and all this stuff.  There was so much that like high level just made my,  I started the Twitch.  It's so specific to rank and rent  that if you aren't in rank and rent,  this stuff wouldn't really make sense,  which I think is the beauty behind it.  Guys, this should show you how confident me and Ryan are  in this fricking industry.  You know, everyone says, how saturated is this?  Well, it's not saturated enough to discourage us from this.  Like this is literally built for rank and rent.  So let's do one more.  Do we still need a call tracking service  or does this call take care of that?  Does this tool take care of that?  Yeah, so all your calls here.  Excuse me.  What's up?  Can you hear me?  Yeah, I got you.  Okay, keep going, keep going.  My internet went out.  Keep going.  I was ready to ride into the sunset, man.  I had it.  I had it going.  Sorry, bro.  Sorry.  I was gonna ride into the sunset.  All right, guys.  So the question is about call tracker.  This is all that you need for programmable voice  and messaging.  So if you're in here, you could buy the phone numbers.  You can find a free number of phone numbers  for your plan, right?  So if you want more than that, you can add phone numbers.  Your phone numbers are free.  And then you set up your right here on the platform, right?  Where you can listen to call recordings.  You can add notes to the call to go and look at it.  It's like important lead information.  All that's done right in here.  You don't have to use any third party service  like CallRail or Twilio or whatever.  Buy numbers in the platform or that you wanna go into  and set them",

You currently, at this version,  you cannot port numbers into this platform yet,  but that is definitely a high priority item.  Shit.  Can you not hear me?  Wow.  That's crazy.  I think we lost you, Nick.  Can you hear me now?  How about now?  How about now, Ryan?  If you guys have interest in having an API call being made  like Zapier or something like that,  the data is already in the backend normalized.

Apparently, my WiFi's a little bit shoddy here,  but I was just letting them know  you cannot port numbers into the software currently,  but that is something that's a high priority item for us  to make sure that's implemented,  but you can buy numbers through the platform.  Yeah, and you can bring in your own number here.  You can select a tracking number or you can add one.  So you can enter your own tracking number right here  so that if you've got another voice system,  you've got some numbers on it,  it's no big deal.  Just come in here, put your number in,  and it's tied into your site portfolio.  And there's no issue with that.  I've got sites that are like that,  that they aren't ported in yet.  And we wanna make it to where you guys can port in  your numbers if you want to,  to get off whatever old platform that you're on.  But in the meantime, you can just put those numbers  right into your site portfolio and tie it up  with whatever site that you're working on.  So would that mean it would still track the leads or no?  It wouldn't show up as the calls.  It would just show what phone number is assigned  to which website right here on the platform,  even if it's like a third-party service.  For sure.  And that is something, guys, we didn't want it.  Again, it's like, let's just get this thing out.  Rather than wait super long.  I was like, Ryan, you should just push this thing out.  So anyway, I think we've gone on long enough.  All caps Landlord 24.  That's the promo code, 20% off for the first two months.  Got the community.  We gave away the swag.  We've got the AirPod Max winners.  And I think that is it.  Ryan Dalton, thanks for being on the call, man.  Yeah, ARTA Digital Real Estate.  Great to be on here with you guys.  Nick, thanks for having me on, man.  I learned a lot from you.  And I'm always deeply grateful for it.  Guys, I'm born and raised.  The first group I ever found about this was,  it used to be called ARTA Pre-Selling.  And it ain't that anymore.  It's all grown up.  And so that's how I got started.  So I found this group.  And two and a half years later,  here we are in different life, different world.  I love",

    "pageContent": " So guys, we're going to be doing strategic follow up in between all these leads.  We're not just going to send them five leads and get on the call and hope they've gotten  a hold of them.  So here's a couple of rules of thumb that I'm going to teach you that I do.  Number one, I do not send and you are not going to send the second lead until they have  scheduled an estimate with the first or the first has told them to go screw themselves  because something happened along the way.  Until the first is taken care of, meaning they have scheduled an estimate, they're not  getting number two and they're not getting number three until number two is taken care  of because what I've seen happen too often, and I used to do this, you go and you start  pumping them three, four, five leads and guess what?  They haven't even gotten a hold of the first one.  You want to prove through your actions, not just through your words, that these leads  are digital freaking gold.  So don't send number two until number one has been taken care of.  So what I'll typically do is let's say that we try to do the first live transfer, it doesn't  answer.  We do a three way text and I have another lead to send.  I will call the business owner and I will say, hey, sorry to bug you.  I'm not going to be annoying.  And that's the other thing I want to talk about.  Don't be annoying.  I want you to be at the top and forefront of their mind, but you are there to help them  not be annoying.  You need to be persistent, but you don't need to be overbearing.  So you're going to call them and say, hey, I have another lead that's come in.  I want to make sure you got a hold of Janet first.  Did she get scheduled?  Oh, no, no, no, no.  Not yet.  Okay.  Well, why don't you get her scheduled and I'll get this other lead ready to go.  And as soon as it's scheduled, I'll send it over.  Okay, guys, you need to be doing this.  You need to prove to them through your actions that these are digital gold.  And until you start treating them this way, the business owner is not going to take them  seriously.  Do not send five leads, show up on the Zoom call and then be surprised they got a hold  of none of them.  Do not send lead number two until lead number one has been scheduled for an estimate.  Okay.  So that's number one.  Number two, as I said, do not be annoying, be persistent, be top of mind, but don't be  annoying.  You're there to help them.  And if they have, if they're, if in the, the, this process in the live transfer process,  they can't stand you.  They're not going to want to work with you, but you need to be persistent.  You need to let them know through your actions that these leads mean everything to you.  This partnership means everything to you.  And these soft touches in between each lead is an opportunity for you to get comfortable  with the business owner, get that relationship with the business owner.  Last point I want to cover, guys, is what's going to happen occasionally is you're going  to send that first lead, okay.  And all of a sudden you're going to get ghosted or you think you're getting ghosted, okay.  You sent the first lead and you just can't get a hold of them.  And they're just not responding.  They're not answering your",

    "pageContent": "calls.  They're not answering your texts.  And you're like, what do I do?  Do I send the second lead?  Do I go find somebody else?  What do I do?  I'm going to tell you what to do.  You are going to use a pullback, okay.  And if you don't know what that is, you didn't watch the previous module and I want you to  go watch it, okay.  And if you want to refresh, go watch the module before and there's a video called the pullback.  This is a perfect opportunity to use a pullback.  And you're going to do something that I know it goes against the grain.  I know it probably frightens you, but you are going to gain control of the situation  because you are the one giving them leads.  You are the one that has what they need and they're the ones that are basically through  their actions telling you, hey bro, hey lady, you know, we're doing this on my time, okay.  So you need to get control of that situation and you don't need to get too aggressive,  but you need to be firm.  So quick example, let's say I've sent one or two leads.  These are good leads.  I listened to them and now they're not answering, okay.  I'm trying to get a hold of them to make sure they've scheduled number two and they're not  answering.  I've called them twice.  I've text them twice.  I'm going to do a pullback in the form of basically what I would, I would call this  a breakup tech.  So we're going to get into that later, but essentially I'm going to call them, leave  a voicemail or I'm going to text them and say something like this, Hey Jim, Nick here.  I, Hey, I've tried to get ahold of you for the past 24 hours.  I have two or three more leads that are piling up and I can't get ahold of you.  Look, if you're not interested and you're too busy to handle these leads and I'm just  making your problems worse, no problem.  But I need to know, I need to hear from you within X timeframe or I've got to move on  to the next company.  Thanks Nick.  Okay.  Something simple to the point, but something that slaps, something that freaking punches  them in the face.  It says, Hey lady, Hey guy, you need to answer these, my damn calls.  You need to answer my texts because I'm the one that's freaking putting money in your  mouth, putting money in your pocket, spoon feeding you leads in your mouth or I'm moving  on.  Okay.  So this is an opportunity to use a pullback.  So guys, just to reiterate, do not be afraid to use pullbacks.  This is a perfect chance to use a pullback.  And if you get ghosted at any point during the process of sending these live transfer  leads, do the pullback, get control of the situation back and get back onto the sales  process.",

    "pageContent": " Tips on closing faster.  I find it takes a few weeks to close  while it takes some like two weeks.  Nate Eath, great question.  My biggest advice for that is  you don't need as many leads as you think, okay?  I have closed deals where I've sent two leads  in a period of 24 hours.  They haven't even run the leads.  They've literally just scheduled the estimates  or yeah, usually scheduled the estimates  but they haven't even gotten the chance to get out.  But I can tell by the way we're talking,  I can tell by the rapport that was built,  I can just tell because I've done it enough,  hey, this person is ready to go.  This person's ready to freaking,  you know what I'm saying?  And I'm sending it.  So my only advice is test it, dude.  Test it at three leads.  If you have three leads sent, two leads sent  and it feels right, even though you're like,  man, that seems like it's only been two days  or I've only sent them two leads  but it just kind of feels like they're ready, send it, dude.  Try it out.  What's the worst that can happen?  You don't need to send as many leads as you think, okay?",

    "pageContent": " Robert said, he's got clicks, but no phone calls.  Can you assist?  So guys, one thing I would love to just try  and just reiterate that something that I've tried  to really focus on is try to just,  whenever you have an issue in your business,  try to just use your intuition and think, okay.  And by the way, this goes for anything.  If you're not, if your business owners aren't closing,  but you're getting a bunch of people to a closing call,  then you could use the same exact logic, okay?  But with this situation, you're like, okay,  I'm getting clicks, but no phone calls.  So that means that people are clicking on my ads  and I'm getting no phone calls.  So well, then you start kind of digging deeper.  You go, all right, well, assuming that these people  are visiting my website, then that would mean  that I'm either getting the wrong people to my website,  right, because they're just not, they're not ready to buy.  They're not ready to call for an estimate.  So that could be number one.  The other thing is I have the right people,  but my landing page isn't converting, right?  So that's what you have to look at  and you have to kind of be logical about it, okay?  So what I would recommend is there's a couple  of different things that you can do.  If you have an idea that maybe your website's  not converting, you can go,  there's a software called Hotjar.  You can install Hotjar on your,  and there's other ones too,  but you can install Hotjar on your website.  You can track and look at what people,  you know, when they come to the page,  what are they doing?  Are they scrolling below the fold?  Are they doing this?  Are they doing that?  Whatever.  So that's an idea.  If you think it's a conversion issue,  if you think it's maybe the wrong type of customer,  or you think they're clicking on the ad  and they're not going to the website, for example,  I know sometimes I used to think it was my competitors,  maybe you could go and you could set up your analytics.  You could see, are you getting, you know,  how much traffic are you actually getting?  Is it increasing?  Is it lining up with how many clicks you're getting?  And you just kind of have to dissect it from there  and you just have to do a process of elimination.  But if you guys are using the core keywords,  you guys are following the training,  most likely you have the right traffic going to your website,  which means that you have a conversion issue,  which then I would go, hey, is your website,  you know, something that's actually converting,  is it user friendly?  Is it something that is scaring people off?  Is the number easy to find?  Is the quote form easy to find?  Or are you burying the stuff at the bottom,  making it difficult?  So you just kind of have to use your intuition there.  Go look at some of our example websites.  You can go look at BentonvilleConcrete.com.  It doesn't have to be complicated.  It's very simple.  I promise you guys, even the ugly websites convert.  So that's kind of how I would attack that.  But that's a really good question, Robert.",

    "pageContent": " Guys, welcome to part two of Digital Landlords.  This is the section where we're going to talk about building the actual asset.  We've got the deal, we've got the credit card on file, we've got the contract signed, AmEx  or Visa baby, and now it's time to go and build this thing out.  But a couple of things I want to mention really, really quick.  And that is, number one, if you do not have your first deal, let me repeat, if you do  not have your first deal, stop this video right now and go back and watch the other  modules and keep doing what it talks about, the sales piece, steps one through seven again  and again and again until you get your first deal.  Because I do not want you playing with this stuff, I do not need you messing with this  you get a deal because until you get a deal, this is nothing more than a hobby and we need  to make money.  So if you don't have a deal, go back and watch the modules.  What happens, and the reason I'm not releasing these to people until they get their first  deal, and I've been strategic about this, is because I don't want people having an excuse  to not be doing sales.  So if you don't have your first deal, go back.  Number two, this does not take a front seat to sales.  Even though we're going to be building these modules, or sorry, even though we're going  to be building the sites out now, now that we've gotten the deals, and as we continue  to get deals, this does not take precedence, this does not take priority.  How I structure my day, how you should structure your day is you still need to be hitting sales  during the golden hours, and then in the gaps, in the downtime at nights, in the afternoons  when things are slow, that's when you build these websites, because we need to use our  energy, our creativity, our focus to get the deals, because sales is what drives this machine.  Money loves speed.  Do not forget that, money loves speed.  So do not let this take a front seat to sales.  Sales fill takes the front seat, okay?  And lastly, this is an art, not a science.  This is not an exact science.  Things are going to change, so at the time of recording this, I'm going to explain things  as we're doing them, and as they are working as we speak, but this is an art, not a science,  and so therefore, we're always going to be innovating, we're always going to be testing  and tweaking and trying and everything else, and we're going to do the best that we can  with the information that we have, and basically with SEO, what we look at is, okay, we've  done X, Y, and Z steps for these different sites, and these different niches, and these  different cities, and it's got us to rank.  So we're going to keep doing it, because it's working, okay?  So I'm just going to be explaining to you guys what I do from all the programs I've  taken, from all the experience I have, and all the people that I've talked to, and the  success that I've had with SEO, and what has worked for me in these niches, and with this  specific business model, which is rank and rent, digital real estate.  All right, guys, let's get into it.",

I'm like dude, come on  Yeah, you can and I literally that's why I put that on my story  I said do bear do bear shit in the wood  There's a bear shit in the woods and you said not in December, which I know we were both joking  But guys it is December like that's a really good. In fact, I want to bring that up  Some of you guys are frustrated. Like I had a couple people that were like, hey  I've got these campaigns that are not like there's no clicks  Impressions and all this different shit, but there's no clicks and I a couple of those people I said, okay  What are your niches and a lot of them are niches that we said were good like concrete tree service  They are good, but you guys have to still keep in mind. There's other factors, right?  so for example, if you are thinking you're gonna do like a concrete Legion in South Dakota or North Dakota or  Minnesota and it's gonna pop off in December  It's not okay, you're still probably gonna get a lead here and there but guys it's cold as shit than those places  People don't want it like I have tree service clients that literally don't work in the winter  So if I was doing tree service, I would think what spots are warm  Florida feet like there's just one more layer. I shouldn't have to cover that you guys need to just use your head, right?  It's the same thing. Don't go put up an artificial grass site in some shitty-ass city in Kansas  Because it year-round it's probably not gonna be that great go do it in the Florida and the Phoenix and the Vegas whatever, right?  and obviously take it through module one, but the reason that B has been so successful is  He the niche he's going after and now everyone's gonna be like, oh towing is the niche  The reason that's good is because he's hitting it while it's hot. That's great  You hit it while it's hot slap him in a contract now. He's gonna when he pitches the deal  He needs to make sure to say hey, look, we know December's hot  But when it gets a little bit slower in the summer whenever the slow season is for for towing  It's the same thing as the winter for concrete. So B's getting leads quick because he's in towing is it because it's towing  No, it's because he's picking a niche now like I'm just throwing that out there because I know a couple of you guys  You guys still have to be humans, okay, you still have to consider that I am NOT doing concrete in Minnesota  No way in hell. Okay, so start using our heads a little bit  I'm also not doing snow removal just because it's hot right now because it's gonna be completely dead in the summer. Okay",

    "pageContent": " All right, guys, welcome to the call.  I've got my notes over here.  There's a couple things.  Let me move this onto my screen here.  There's a few things I want to just make sure to cover really, really quick.  Let's see.  Okay.  Two things I want to cover quick.  Then I'm going to have Mr. Zach Palcomano talk about hiring.  We're going to be talking about how leverage, how to scale through hiring, okay?  How to duplicate yourself and actually build a business that you don't have to be a slave  to, okay?  So, number one, I was looking yesterday through the ... I was going through the training  yesterday myself.  Some of you guys know, or most of you guys should know, I am in the process of redoing  the training and not just reshooting the training, but redoing the way that we do this training,  the way that the whole experience, the way that we hold everyone accountable, the way  that we track out the progress of everybody, the way that the content is delivered.  I'm really, really excited about it, and it's ironic because the way that we planned on  doing it seemed kind of outside the box, and it seemed a bit weird because I hadn't seen  anybody do it, and I got to give credit to Aaron because Aaron's the one that initially  came with the idea, and then I was like, okay, I'm with you, even though it's not the way  that anybody I've seen is doing it, none of the big guys that whatever.  And then, I had ... there's somebody I really, really respect that has a very, very expensive  program, a $30,000 plus program, and I found out they're using this exact same kind of  system that we're going to be using, so I'm very, very excited, and just before anyone  asks, because I know you guys are excited, it's going to be out sometime in quarter one,  okay? Now, I'm not sure. I'm giving myself those three months just so that I have proper time.  I don't just want to fling something out. I want to have this thing be proper, so that's the goal.  That means that it could come out the last day of March. It also could come out sometime in  January. It could come out sometime in February. My goal is to get it done as quickly as possible,  as well as make sure that it is properly done. So, for those of you that are sitting there going,  I'm going to wait until version 3.0. Guys, there is going to be nothing in version 3.0  that is going to be some magic bullet that's going to make you a millionaire, okay?  There are people in this group, aka Ryan Dalton, that have used the information that is here right  now. That is, he's at $87,000 per month. There's another person I want to give a shout out to  really quick, Mr. Drew Wolber, who messaged me yesterday. We were talking, and he sent me a  screenshot of his, I think it was his Stripe account. He is approaching $50,000 per month,  and he just started. I was like, how did Drew join? I went in, I looked, he joined just over  a year ago, okay? So, for anyone sitting there going, oh, there's nothing missing. The training  is the same training, exactly what I used to get to Seven Figures. It's what Ryan's used to get the  Seven Figure run rate. It's what Drew used to get to $50,000. It's what Juan Finesse used to get to",

    "pageContent": " $40,000. It's what Mike Veas used to get to $40,000. There's nothing missing, but I am excited to give  you guys something and deliver it differently that's outside the box, that's going to be a bit,  it's going to be a breath of fresh air. So, I just don't want you guys to sit around going,  I'm going to wait until the next one. No, go get some money. Go make some money right now. Go get  deals. Don't take your foot off the gas right now. It's December, but this is the perfect time  to put your foot on the gas, stomp on some throats, and go make some money, okay?  That said, I was looking at the training yesterday as I was going through version 2.0,  and I was looking, and we have our core training, which is digital landlords, which is how to get  the deal all the way to the sales FAQ, the ads FAQ, and then how to build the website, how to  rank the website, all of the technical stuff, okay, which we're going to be adding a lot more  information to on version 3.0. And I remembered that we have this other section called the premium  sales training library, which obviously I, of course, always knew that because I have a little  reminder for myself every week or every month to try and add new content to that as much as possible.  And I realized out of the 700 people, whatever, only 200 people, 220 or something people are  actually have access to the premium sales training library. So if you want, let me just  tell you this really quick. The premium sales training library is a compilation. It's not  done yet. It's ever evolving. It's ever being added to. It's something that I've started  creating and having a lot of fun with. This is 10 years of sales experience  in distilled into a training. Okay. And there's multiple videos. There's going to be more  content added to get access to the premium sales training library. You need to be paid in full your  tuition, the cost of entering this program. Some of you guys joined when we were still doing  internal payment programs or you guys use other funding sources. You need to be paid in full  with me. And if you are, you get access, you are granted access. You have the right to access  this premium sales training library, but it's shocking because less than a third of the people  in this program have access to the premium sales training library. And I know that there's  way more, probably double or double and a half that have paid in full. So if you guys have paid in full  message Aaron or fix it Felix and get access to the premium sales training library. If you have  not, and you would like access to it, go and get paid. What I was going to let you guys know is  right now it's December 3rd. There's 28 days left in the month. And anything like if you were to go  and you had like a thousand bucks left, anything that you do spend on this, because you're going  to spend it anyway, you can actually write it off as a tax write off. I don't know if you guys  understand this, but you can write it off as a tax write off. They can give you a break on your  taxes. So if you guys are people that are on like a payment plan, just get it paid off and write it  off on your taxes and get access to the premium sales training library, quit kicking the can down  the road. Okay. So that is going to be continually added onto that is 10 over 10 years. It's 11",

    "pageContent": "years  of knowledge right here in my brain that I'm trying to put into a mini course that's ever evolving,  ever changing, ever being added onto. And as part of this program, as long as you are paid in full,  that is the premium sales training library. So if you do not have access and you are paid in full,  then reach out to Aaron. And if you are not paid in full, get freaking paid in full,  get access to everything and go and check it out. Secondly, for those of you that have not  started playing around with the rank and rent engine tools, no problem. You don't have to use  it. It's, it's not required. It's not something that you have to have. I will tell you that based  on, I know Ryan came on last week. I was traveling coming back from Dubai. And so thank you, Ryan,  for doing that. But we are so cool because we get to control this tool. We like literally as we,  my team goes through it, Francesca will go through the tool and she's like, Hey, I think  that this little button needs to be put over here to make it easier to drop down the menu and do  this. And I'm like, awesome, put it in a document, put it in a loom, send it to Ryan. And every single  week, every single five days we're sending a loom to Ryan. He's like noted and he goes in,  he talks to the developer and we're changing it. So we get to literally build this tool as we go  and we get to add into it. One of the things that I really, really wanted to see, and I talked to  Ryan about is like, dude, we got to make sure that there's a better, more in-depth way to look at  backlinks, right? And of course we wanted to come out with version 1.0 as soon as possible, as long  as the product was good enough. And we did. And I said, and we're going to have, you know, our tool  right now, it'll tell you how many backlinks, it'll tell you domain authority, a few different  things, but it doesn't really give you the backlink profile in depth. We need something that's at  least of the caliber of mangled. So talk to Ryan, he talked to the developers and we are right now  adding a backlink feature that's going to be as good as mangles right inside of the tool, the same  tool that's going to be your CRM, the same tool that's going to be your due diligence, the same  tool that's going to do everything. And I'm super, super excited about it. So that said guys,  guys, if you haven't already, if you haven't heard this, RankinRanEngine is going to be our go-to tool,  version 3.0. All of our training is going to have RankinRanEngine. We're going to be using  RankinRanEngine to do the search, the search volume. We're going to be doing RankinRanEngine  to do the, you know, check out our competitors, look at their backlink profiles. And if you have  not already, check that out. Now there is a code. Ryan sent it to me yesterday and I don't know  where it's at. Let's see here. Okay, here's the code for those of you. Also, by the way, for those  of you that are not in the U.S., that is our next thing that we're looking at is how do we get this  into as many countries outside of the U.S. as possible. So just so you have an idea, we are ",

You guys message me.  If you guys are interested in RankinRanEngine, message me. I'll send you the code and that's  going to give you a little discount for the first couple months to check out that tool. But anyway,  I'm having so much fun with that tool. I'm doing everything inside of it. I'm not, we got rid of  SEMrush. We got rid of Mangools. We got rid of every single thing. Ahrefs, whatever. We have a  suite of tools. We're paying 300 bucks a month, something like that, just for like basic tools.  And now everything's in one little place. Okay. So that said, guys, that's all I wanted to cover.

We are coming. Let me let Zach in really quick. And as I do that, let's see one second. Freaking  cold in here today. Zach Powell. What's up, Nick? How's it going, man? It's going great, bro. I'm  freezing. I'm going to turn up my heat a little bit while you give yourself a little intro. Give  me about 10 seconds, dude. I'm dying. Hold on. Sounds great. Yeah. I'm excited to be on today.  He said quick intro. I joined Digital Landlords two years ago and now I just love helping people  grow their businesses. So that's what I'm about. Today I'm going to talk about leverage,  which I'm stoked on. I've created a ton of leverage through hiring and building a team.  So great topic for today. I'm stoked. Yeah, bro. Appreciate you being on.  Always a treat to have Zach Powell on. Zach, what's your latest revenue, Mark? I know last  time we talked, it was just over 50,000. Yeah, we're at like 57,000. But there's other,  there's like a ads kind of arm we're adding on to. And so, yeah, it's maybe all together 65 or so.  Amazing. Okay. 65,000. Not bad for somebody who was making just around $6,000 two years ago at a  job. Yeah. Big difference. Yeah, that's crazy, bro. Big difference. How's the new house, dude?  You still enjoying it? Yeah, we call it the office because it's like a house that we work  out of like some team members in the US. We all just come to this house on an acre and  it's like catching the back and then work out of the house. It's fun. That's cool. What was I going  to ask you? Let's see. Oh, did you end up getting rid of the office office since you moved into the  house? Yeah, we were just renting that. So now we own this like acre kind of house office setup.  That's cool. Pretty, pretty fun. I remember when I first moved to St. George here, I was living in  Cedar City and it was cold and I came down, we're looking at houses and there was this guy, we went  and looked at this house and we went through the garage and he had like all these cars out front.

Dude, I thought it was the coolest thing ever. I was like, bro, this guy,  this cat's like literally working out of his house. This is foreign, by the way. This isn't now,  like everyone works out the house now, but back in the day when you've knew somebody that worked  from home, it was like, you know, it was really cool. It was like unattainable. So it's exciting.  But yeah, dude, that's what's possible. I was on yesterday before we get into it and I was like,  I just jumped on really quick. I was looking at my goals and it reminded me like, dude, your whole  life, and this is a reminder for anyone on this call, that your entire life can change in a year.  Like you put your head down and you focus on one thing and you grow it and your entire life can  change in a year. You can go from barely making it, you know, budgeting what vacations are going on  to being able to buy properties, you know, buy your wife whatever car they want, get into a new  house and like your whole identity changes. So it's exciting because we have the tools  in front of us to do that. It's just up to us now. So one of the things that is part of this  business that I wish I had done way sooner was create leverage because I was Mr. like,  you know, solopreneur, do it myself, figure everything out on my own because I could beat  my chest, whatever. And then I realized that the real players, the people that are actually scaling,  they are using other people because there's different types of leverage. Zach's going to  talk about this today, but one of those pieces of leverage is human capital and using other people.  And so everyone, not everyone, but I get some messages sometimes like, when do you recommend  hiring? Okay. And that's one of the things I'm going to ask Zach, his opinion on this. My opinion  is as soon as possible. Okay. So anyway, that said, Zach, I'm going to give you a co-host. That way  you can share anything you want, but we're going to be talking about hiring, creating leverage.  And that is something Zach has done very, very well. It's allowed him to go. Where was it? You  were just on a surfing trip. Was that in Hawaii? No coaster. I was in Hawaii, Hawaii for a month  and then Nicaragua for a week. And then actually this last weekend, they opened a manmade wave,  like 10 minutes from my house in Arizona. And so I was surfing that on like their VIP opening day.  And it was awesome surfing in the desert in Arizona. So that's surfing across the globe,  man. It's, it's been fun. That's amazing, bro. I love that. And that's, that's,  that's the beauty of the business. All right, bro. You got, you got hosts. Let's, let's get into it,  man. You, I'm going to, rather than me direct this, I'm going to have you direct it because  you're the expert and I'll just kind of chip in where I see fit. Sounds great, man. So yeah,  talking about hiring, I think first it's a mindset thing we got to get over. Like you mentioned,  so I'm going to get into that. I'll share my screen, how I think about hiring and then also  share like",

    "pageContent": "how I actually do hiring and kind of my playbook for that. So let me share my screen  and I'll walk you through how I think about it.  All right. We good. You guys see this? I can see a white, yeah, a whiteboard.  Whiteboard. Okay. Here we go. If you guys have like journals or notes, like you're going to want to  write this down. It's pretty awesome stuff. That's opened my mind a lot. So the first one,  there's three things I'll show you real quick. And then I'll stop sharing, but the first one  to talk about real quick, it's called your buyback rate. And this will open your mind a lot. Buyback  rate. What is buyback rate and how do you calculate it? So essentially the reason we want our buyback  rate is you want to grow a company that you don't grow to hate. You want to grow a company that you  enjoy running. And so you don't want to hire, to actually grow your business. You want to hire,  to buy back your time. And I'll explain what this means, but the first step is calculating your  buyback rate. So buyback rate, the first thing is your income. This is like, if you have a job right  now, that income counts and the income from your business and all the write-offs that are like  for you. Basically all the money you have, like you guys know what I'm talking about when  you're buying things, you would have bought in any way, but you buy through your business.  All of the income, all of the financial gain you receive from your job, from your business,  from everything goes into your buyback rate. So income divided by 2000 hours. Why 2000 hours?  2000 hours because there's about 50 working weeks in the year, 40 hours in a week. That equals 2000  working hours in an average year. So divide your income by 2000 hours. That gives you what  your time is worth per hour, dollars an hour. One of the biggest issues with hiring is people don't  think their time is actually worth what it's worth. And so they're doing $5 tasks when their  time is worth $100 an hour. And it just absolutely makes no sense. And so this will help it kind of  become clear for you guys. So let's just use an example. Let's say your income with your W-2,  your job, your company, like everything, whatever. Let's say it's 100,000. 100k divided by 2000 hours  that equals $50 an hour. We'll just use that an example. So your time is worth $50 an hour.  And so are you valuing your time at that rate? So that's the first piece. Then you take what  your time is worth per hour. And guys, figure this out right now. Look at the past 12 months.  Calculate what your income has been the past 12 months. Divide that by 2000 hours. Get your  buyback rate right now. Once you have what your time is worth per hour, then you take that $50 an  hour divided by four. That would be $12.50. Why divide by four? Because $12.50 is what you can hire  somebody for and get a four times return on your investment. So if you hire someone for $12.50 an  hour or less, you automatically have a four times return on your investment if they take things off  your plate, if they do things that you would have done. And that's the key. So in this example,  let's say this person makes $100,000 a year, their",

    "pageContent": "buyback rate is $12.50 an hour. And so like  when I first did this, it kind of blew my mind. A couple years ago, I calculated this and I was  like, Whoa, my buyback rate is over $30 an hour. And then I looked at what I was doing each day.  And I was like, why am I doing $5 an hour tasks when my time is worth over $30 an hour?  It doesn't make sense. So sometimes we got to see. Go ahead. So anything, just to clarify,  so anything that is, just explain again, the $12.50. So anything that's less than that,  you should be hiring out. Explain that piece. Once you calculate your buyback rate,  what does that mean? And what should we do with that information? Because I saw a few  people that just jumped on. Awesome question. So basically, anything you do that you can pay  someone $12.50 or less to do, pay them to do that. Get that off your plate, buy back your time.  And this will go into the next piece here. That's an awesome question. The next piece  is the time and energy audit. So this is step one. Step two is the time and energy audit. And then  we'll go to step three. So step two answers that question in depth really well. So I'll just hop  right into that. We'll do the next thing, time and energy audit. This one's pretty simple,  but profound as well. Time and energy audit. Okay. So hopefully you've calculated your buyback rate.  If you just hopped on, it's your income, everything, all the money that comes to you,  your job, your business, perks, everything, all that. What's the number? Your income per year  divided by 2000 hours, 2000 working hours in a year, gives you your hourly rate,  what you're worth per hour. Divide that then by four. And that is your buyback rate because  you're getting a four times return on your investment. If you hire someone for a fourth  of what you make per hour, you're automatically getting four times return on your investment,  which is awesome. So next question is like, how do I find the things to take off my plate?  Well, this makes it simple. You just do a time and energy audit. So you write down the task  that you're going to do and you write down the value. And what I do on my watch,  I'll pull up and I'll say, Hey, like, you know, start a 15 minute timer and I'll just refresh  it all day. And every 15 minutes I have my running list and I just write down what I did.  Right. So let's say, um, drive to office there that, and then I do a value,  just $1 sign to $4 signs, $4 signs. If it's super valuable, $1 sign. If it's low value  drive to office. Okay. We'll say that's $1 sign. And then, you know, I get to office  deck email, you know, not that valuable $1 sign. And then I do a sales call sales call.  That is like the most valuable thing I do. That is the most valuable thing. And then I train my team,  team training, and that's valuable. Maybe we'll say $3 signs. Right. So from here,  then what you do, the other piece of this is does it. So it's time and energy audit. You're  auditing your time every 15 minutes. Is this thing valuable, not valuable? Um, and then the other  piece that really makes this, um,",

Do you not  like doing that thing? So drive to the office. Um, you know, I'm going to do email, email, boom.  I'm going to highlight that red, that drains my energy sales call. That actually gives me energy  because I love talking to people, team training. That gives me energy driving to the office. Um,  that drains energy unless I'm going to say, okay, tomorrow when I drive to the office,  I'm going to actually drive to the office and use my car as my university. I'm going to like be  listening to the digital landlords trainings. I'm going to be like learning while I'm driving,  drive to office. We'll do and learn. Boom. Now this value just went up and I enjoy it now. Okay.  So, um, this is the time and energy audit.  You audit your time and your energy. And what happens is you do this for a week and then you  start noticing all the things that are red and drain your energy and that are $1 signs.  And all of those things are the things that you see. How the heck can I stop doing that  and pay someone my buyback rate or less to do that for me? And now you have the exact  things you want to hire for. Um, for example, my first hire that I ever hired was a content writer.  Why? Because that drained my energy and I could hire someone, $4 an hour, $5 an hour to do that  for me. And I'm like, why am I spending 10 hours a week writing content? It makes no sense. Right.  Why next thing was building websites. Why am I building websites? So does that make sense?  Everybody, any questions so far? I guess in the chat, like put any takeaways, like what do you,  it's not what's taught, it's what's caught. So like, what do you guys catch in? Like what,  what so far is your biggest takeaway in the chat? Like teach each other, share that.  That when, uh, when you're doing the energy and time audit, do you, you write down,  I've done this before, but I haven't really done it as specific as you, which is like  drive to the office, like every single thing. Um, how do you, when it's stuff like that, do you like,  okay, let's say that you hate driving to the office. You hate, uh, you know, going and getting  lunch because both those things kind of like suck your energy and they're not really, I mean,  they're not providing money. They're just taking money. How do you get like, have you considered  hiring somebody or different solutions for that? Like, let's say driving to the office, what do you  do in that situation? You're like, okay, maybe I can't hire somebody, but I can start working from  home. Or you start thinking outside the box like that. Like what are some solutions to it instead  of just hiring or I'm talking about the things maybe outside of the business tasks, but that  you still have to do that are draining your energy.  That's an awesome question. Um, I think the first step is being aware, right? Like the first thing  that I would say you want to be problem aware. So the time and energy audit makes you problem  aware. And when you're aware and you write it down, then your brain starts working on it. And  you're like, how could I use my time more effectively? People that make",

    "pageContent": "millions and  millions of dollars a year, use their time much more effectively than people that make  $50,000 a year, right? So if we can look at how we're spending our time, this is actually super  eye opening. Like the first time I did this, the way I spent my time, the way I thought I spent my  time wasn't actually how I spent my time. So like, I challenge you guys to actually do this and  you'll realize like, whoa, I spend way more time than I thought, um, doing content writing or  building websites or these things that if it's on a computer, you can hire someone around the  world to do it. Um, and this will open your eyes. One thought on that with it's, it's not necessarily  hiring a VA from, from online jobs, but if you guys are like sitting at your house and you're  like, well, it's time for me to get lunch and you're driving to go get food because you want  to save $5 from a door dash fees. You guys are being very, very short-sighted because you can  literally spend, I can order Chipotle. You could count to 12. I can order it in like 12 seconds  and it would show up at my door and I saved like 45 minutes a day. And yes, instead of my Chipotle  bowl being $8, it's like 18 with delivery fee in the tip, but like the cost me 10 bucks. I just  bought 45 minutes of my time for $10 and it doesn't take me off task. I don't get stuck in  traffic. I don't get caught by my buddy. That's like, Hey bro, let me pick your brain, you know,  and you're not have to be rude. And then you get distracted. So it's the same concept, even though  you're not necessarily hiring a VA in the Philippines, you're hiring a door dash person  and it's costing you 10 extra dollars every day, but that saves you so much time. So just a thought.  That's awesome because it's not just employees, right? It's how it's like, you want to design  your life and to be aware first, you need to know how much your time is worth and then you need to  know how you're using your time. Time is the most precious resource, right? Like how are you using  it? So when you're thinking about that, like the reason I want to show you guys this is the way  is the way you spend your time isn't how you think you spend your time. Generally, we think  that we are much more effective than we actually are. So this is massively eye opening. So I  challenge you guys to do this. Okay. The third piece that'll kind of bring this all together,  it's called the buyback loop and it looks like this. Here we go.  It looks like this.  An arrow right there. So what happens, there's three steps. You audit your time with the time  and energy audit. You transfer the low value and energy draining things,  transfer to another person, to AI, like Nick's thing, DoorDash, like you transfer those things  to buy back your time, to get your energy where you want it. And then you fill, you fill your time  with more things that light you up that are green and are four dollar signs more valuable.  And it's a continuous cycle. You audit, transfer, fill, audit, transfer, fill, and you just spiral  upwards. And the momentum comes from the fill. Like you have to fill your time with things that  are more valuable than you used to do. And that's why it's so powerful. So this, this",

    "pageContent": "kind of  connects it all. And what happens is right here, this is called the pain line right here. And what  happens, people, you won't grow into pain if it is uncomfortable or, you know, you're not going to  make more sales calls. You're not going to grind harder if you know that that's just going to add  a ton of stress to your life. But what if you know that growing, adding monthly recurring revenue  to your business doesn't make you have to work more and more and more, but you have like the  ability to transfer and fill and you're making more money doing things, doing more of the things  that you like doing. So that kind of connects it all here. You have your buyback rate, you know  what your time is worth, and then you look at how you're spending your time and the energy it gives  you. One thing I haven't said yet either is over time doing these time and energy audits,  you'll realize, oh, I have more energy in the morning or I have more energy at night and then  structure your day accordingly. You know, if you have high value tasks that light you up,  do those when you have a lot of energy and like, you know, use your, your being tuned with your  body and like, no, okay, here's my energy. And then you'll be able to produce better work and  organize your day accordingly. So doing that, and then using this, it's called the buyback loop,  using the buyback loop to audit your time, transfer these low value, energy draining things  to other people. And then the key, the ticket, and people always get this wrong, is they fill  their time with social media, or they fill their time with like, stupid stuff that doesn't push  the needle forward. They fill their time, you know, like, time will expand, and you'll just  take like three hours to do something that you could do in 15 minutes. So the key is fill your  time with these things that are high value that you like doing. And then you build a life that you  you never want to retire from you build a life that you love. So yeah, is that making sense  for everybody or any any questions? Throw them in the chat. There's a couple questions I want to  mention, I want to give you this fun, this really extreme example. So I have a buddy.  He is a real estate agent. And he's been for as long as I've known him since about 2018,  this guy makes like, he makes over seven figures in commissions as a real estate agent, which is  very, very impressive, right? It's very difficult to find anyone that can make a seven figures  outside of owning their own business. And yeah, technically, you own your own business is real  estate. This guy's in St. George, Utah. He's not in Hollywood. He's he's makes he's mixed seven  figures doing real estate. This guy's a machine, dude. He's on the phone, I think like four hours  a day just cold calling. And I remember we used to do this meet, we'd meet like once a week have  lunch, like a group of us. And he was like, Yeah, I'm thinking about like, how do I can save time  and how I can because he makes money when he's on the phone, like that's it. And so what he did is  he bought a Sprinter van, he wrapped it with his logo to you know, whatever. And then he set up an  office inside the Sprinter van so that when he's on his way to showings, he can be dialing while  he's on his way to showings. And I",

    "pageContent": "was like, dude, that's so gangster. That is so next level that  he's even worried about the 15 minutes in between showing so he can be on his computer and making  those extra five phone calls, which I thought was pretty dang sweet. And sure enough, about a year  and a half later, I noticed his Sprinter van around town like he actually did it. He actually  freaking did it. So that's the kind of an extreme example. But one more thing I want to add.  It's kind of like, what Zach saying is super important about filling the time because it's  like, I don't remember, dude, I think maybe probably one of your missionaries, when we used  to teach people like, hey, if you're going to remove this bad habit, you have to fill it with  something else. Otherwise, it's like a hole, and the hole is going to be filled. So you got to  fill it with something good, or it's going to get filled with something not as good. So make sure  that you're not just leaving these empty gaps. We all know those people that go to the gym for  three hours, and you can get the gym done in 45 minutes to an hour. You don't need to be there  three hours. I don't care who you are. You don't need to be there three hours. An hour is plenty.  So I think that's super, super valuable. One thing I want to ask, Zach, how often do you recommend,  or do you personally do time and energy audits? Is it quarterly, monthly,  once a year? What's your go-to? And then we'll get into some of the questions everyone has.  Yeah, awesome question. I would say quarterly, once you've kind of gotten a good routine,  when you start this out, do like, start now and do it for two weeks, and then adjust. You're going  to make a lot of quick adjustments, and then do another one a couple weeks later, and a couple  weeks later until you feel like you have a good flow. Once you have a good flow of how you're  spending your time each day, and your routine, and it's dialed in, then you can go to quarterly.  But if you ever, the general thing is whenever you feel like, oh man, you know when you have  that feeling bogged down, or you're not stoked on what you're doing, do another time and energy  audit, and figure out why. Figure out why you're not completely stoked on your life.  Because you should be. You're a business owner. If you're doing it right, if you're owning your  business in the right way, we should be like the happiest people on earth, because we own our time.  We can work from anywhere. It's awesome. We can use the money the company generates to live the  best life we want to live, and keep making more money at the same time, if we do it right. So  that's kind of my thoughts on that. So you would recommend everyone  two weeks, go do a two week energy. Are you doing this on weekends too?  Oh yeah, yep. And I actually have like, I made it into a Google Sheet, so if anybody wants that,  just like direct message me, time and energy audit, and then I'll send you a link. You can  make a copy of mine, and you know, do it in the Google Sheet. But honestly, it's as simple as  this. You can just do it in a notepad, and just write it. Super cool, super easy. But  let me stop to share here too. You're good. I'm going to write direct message Zach Powell,",

    "pageContent": " time energy audit to get his Google Sheet. And yeah, the other thing though is, I guess that's  just all of that is for the mindset, right? People have issues hiring because they're like,  I can do it, I can do it. It's just human nature. Like you were saying, we all do it, we all hold  on to things too long. But when we look at the numbers, we look at our buyback rate. Oh, shoot,  my time is worth $100 an hour. Now I can hire someone $25 an hour or less, man, I can do,  I can hire someone at that rate to do almost everything I do, right? And you upgrade your  life. And now you're doing way more effective stuff. So doing those three things and helping  those all come together in your mind will give you the confidence and realize it's actually dumb  for me to not hire. And that's what it usually takes for people to get to the point where they  start hiring. And then the issue becomes people are terrible at hiring. And I know we're running  short on time. But the next thing is like, how do you hire? And so I have like a full hiring  playbook of how I get a ton of applicants and dwindle them down automatically without taking  a lot of time to find awesome people to add to my team. So if anybody wants like my hiring  playbook, what I do, just direct message me like the word hiring, and I'll shoot you the link,  I have like a Google Doc of my process. So maybe I'll put that in the chat. But  I'll put it real quick. I'll put Zach for the hiring playbook. And he put this together guys,  for time's sake. And also because he's he's done this a lot. DM Zach Powell for hiring playbook.  Okay. All right. So you don't mind getting blown up?  Yeah. Yeah, it's fine. Everyone can just DM me like I love helping you guys we can  chat whatever. But the biggest thing is like with hiring, most people don't get enough applicants.  That's the number one issue. They don't have a big enough pool of people applying for their jobs.  So then they end up with like a couple applicants and they just pick one and hire someone not good.  So you want a lot of applicants. This is what the hiring playbook shows and shows my process for  getting a ton of applicants and then automatically dwindling those down to the best ones. So it  doesn't take a ton of your time, but you effectively get all the best ones in a group. That's the other  thing people do wrong is like they waste too much time trying to hire. And then it's a pain. And  that's why they don't upgrade and, you know, hire and transfer and fill very well is like it takes  so much time. So my playbook like makes it easy to automatically dwindle it down. And then the third  thing is like they end up with subpar employees because their hiring funnel is so thin, right? So  thick hiring funnel. Now you have the cream of the crop, way better people. When I first started  hiring, I made a lot of bad hires. Now almost every single hire is phenomenal because they align  so well. Like I have this huge pool and they align so well. And I just add phenomenal people to my  team time after time after time. So you want my playbook for how I do that? Just message me hiring.  I'll send it to you. Message me if you want the time and energy audit. These have been like  huge things for me to take it to the next level. And like not just financially because at one point  I was making a lot of money,",

So if you want to build a business that you never want to retire  from, that's how you do it, which is fun to think about. A couple of questions that were a little  more specific. Luke Hill has a question. How do you trust VAs with things like cPanel to build  out the site? Because it sounds like he's using WordPress. I know that like on Weebly and stuff,  you can give limited access. And I know you use Duda, but how do you deal? Let's just make it a  more general question. How do you hire or trust VAs and stuff with a little more sensitive  information? I think most tools will allow you to give limited access. I don't use WordPress,  but I've used it a teeny amount to know that you're talking about WordPress. Any thoughts on that?  Yeah, awesome question. Just as with anything, you build trust over time. So when you hire someone  through the hiring process, you've gained trust. And now you have your onboarding, right? You  should have an onboarding sequence of video recordings of yourself doing things and training  them. Video recordings of you training your team, they go through these things. And as you work with  them, you build trust. They start trusting you as the owner, someone that's going to pay their  salary, someone to work for that you're going to invest in them, care about them, have a good  company to work at, they're going to build trust in you. And you're going to build trust in them.  You're going to see how quickly they respond in Slack. You're going to see how quickly they do  things. You're going to see the quality of their work very quickly. And so like Nick's saying,  you can give them the all back access. And then over time, as you build trust, you give them more.  You know, now I have an assistant I've worked with for over two years. I just give her my  passwords to everything. We have like 100% trust. Yeah, yeah, she could rob me and steal  a couple thousand bucks. But it's like, yeah, she lost her job. Would you steal from your boss  thousands of dollars? No, probably not. Because you would lose your job. Are they going to steal  hundreds of dollars from me? No, because then they're going to lose their job. Like, it's just,  that's like another mental barrier that people have is like, I can't give this because I don't  trust the person will give them things that they can't mess up. Or like if they mess up,  it's low. It's like low, what do you call it? Low? Yeah, yeah, it's it's it's low. Yeah, low,  low risk, basically. Yeah, low risk. That's the risk. That's the low risk. That's what you want.  And then just build and give them more and more and more. So one thing, awesome question. It's  another mindset thing. One thing too, from our training, we've had Joe Jonas, the founder of  onlinejobs.ph on like twice. And I remember that he said, like he has employed his VA's have access  to literally everything, including his bank, including his credit cards. But what's so  interesting is that in the Philippines, this is such a cultural thing. There you're people that  mean, yes, there's going to be some bad people, but people that are on that site, for the most part,  like it's culturally unacceptable to basically ruin your boss or go backstab or not be",

    "pageContent": "loyal.  Like loyalty is a big thing in the Philippines. One of the reasons it makes such a good place  for VA. So I've personally never had any bad experiences in terms of like, I've never even  had a VA from the Philippines try and do content that's been plagiarized, which is still a bad  thing, but it's low on the totem pole of like offensive, illegal activity. I've never even  caught anyone doing, you know, plagiarized content. So I don't think it's something you  should super have to worry about. And I also remember in, I remember in a four hour workweek,  Tim Ferriss talking about when he was building a supplement company, when he used to give his VA's  like, basically they would be able to make decisions at anything below a hundred dollars.  So you have to, at some point guys, you have to relinquish control. If you think you're going to  control every aspect of your business forever, then you're not going to grow. It's the exact  saying. It's a mindset thing. And it's a limiting belief because you, you know, and this is one of  the things I heard really quick is we give ourselves as business owners, as entrepreneurs,  you know, we give ourselves slack when we fail because like, well, we learned a lesson,  but we don't give our employees that same slack. Sometimes we expect them to be a hundred percent  perfect. And like they're humans, they're going to mess up. They're going to forget to do this and  that. You have to expect that it's not going to be perfect. They're not going to do, they're not  going to, you can't expect them to carry a hundred percent as much as you because they don't own a  hundred percent of your business. But that's not the goal. You want to get somebody that can do it  80% or better as good as you. And then you hire it out. That's, that's the game. That's the entire  game. So real quick, couple of questions. Jason Adams says, this is why I use Instacart grocery  shopping is low value energy sucking and time consuming. Jason, that's because you've never  been to a Harman's. Just kidding. But I do love, I do love, you know, it's funny thing about me,  and this is one thing we could know. If you have something that's on your list, it's like  low value, but it's high energy. Those are things that you could keep and just kind of  chalk up to like they're your hobbies. Like for me personally, depending on the grocery store,  I don't mind going in grocery store sometimes going into produce. Like it kind of, I kind of  like it. I'm kind of weird like that. But I also know like my dad, if you catch him in a grocery  store, dude, the earth ending tomorrow, like he's done. He's not doing it. Right. So yeah,  that's just that's your investment quadrant, things that light you up, but are low value.  You want to do those things that you're investing in those. It's not your production quadrant, but  you're investing in those things and delegation quadrant, low energy, low money, like get those  off your plate for sure. And dude, I have no problem doing those kinds of things after hours.  I'm not going to do that in the middle of the day, obviously. Nick Kudlick from St. George says,  amazing read, how to buy back your time by Dan Martell. Yes. Phenomenal book. I know you  really like that book, Zach. A lot of these concepts are from",

Um, Luke says Kroger has saved so much of my time with delivery. There's  no fee for delivery. It makes no sense to drive. Beautiful. I agree. A hundred percent. So takeaways,  if you want to get the plate, the, the Google doc that Google sheet that Zach's put together,  DM Zach, if you want to get the playbook, the hiring playbook that Zach's put together,  DM Zach, go blow up Zach's DM. Uh, Zach's one of the only people that doesn't mind. You can go  blow him up. He's, he's obviously he's got limited time, but he's kind enough. You guys message him.  He'll send you those things and walk you through it. Um, any last thoughts you want to end with  before we, we end this, uh, stream Zach. Yeah. One last thought is it doesn't really click for  people. Sometimes this helps it click is you look at Amazon, Google, Microsoft,  the difference between those companies and your company is they have thousands of people,  tens of thousands of people pushing their company forward every day. That's why they're making so  much money. They have thousands of sales reps, thousands of programmers, thousands of people  pushing them forward, pushing forward. Of course they're going to win and make tons and tons of  money. If you only have you pushing you forward, you're just living in the slow lane. Why not hire  someone? And there's people can actually do specific things of your business way better than  you. You think you're going to be a better website builder. You think you're going to be better at  SEO. You think you're going to be better at sales. Even you're not, there's people better at that  thing than you. You just got to find them and set them loose. And now you're going twice as fast,  three times as fast. You have all these people, you become more like Amazon. So that's what needs  to click. Why is Amazon, Google, Facebook, why are they such big companies? Tens, even hundreds  of thousands of people are pushing them forward. Is it just you pushing you forward? Why don't you  enroll someone and push yourself forward way faster? And at the same time, not just do it  to make money and stretch yourself out, but build it right where now your life's awesome  and you're doing things that light you up and make you a ton of money day after day. And it's a  continuous upward spiral. That's the life that I want to live and I invite you guys to live too.  So if you want help with it, just let me know. Happy to chat about it. Beautiful. Zach Powell,  appreciate you, bro. Also, I know Zach does a bunch of stuff. Do you want to jump on?  What's your website? Let me just drop it in here.  ZachPowell.co.  Z-A-C-K-W-E-P-O-W-E-L-L.CO.

    "pageContent": " All right guys, so we've chosen a niche.  We're not going to overthink it.  If you don't know, just going back to what we talked about before, choose concrete.  If you're going to be analysis paralysis and delay choosing, just choose concrete.  Okay?  So we've chosen the niche, we've done our keyword research, and now it's time to go  and find the city.  I don't want you to overthink this too much, but I also want you to understand how important  it is that we do this correctly.  This is where all the money is made and also, unfortunately, where all the money is lost.  All right, so guys, the very first thing we're going to do is we're going to go and get a  tool that shows us demand, shows us search volume.  And for some of you that chose Ahrefs or Mangools or SEMrush or any of these things, it doesn't  matter.  Okay?  And I'm going to explain why.  So let me just show you this really quick.  All right.  So this, I'm going to show you guys SEMrush, SEMrush.com, SEMrush, it is a little bit more  expensive tool.  It's just something I've been using for years and years and years.  I'm just going to use it.  You can use any tool.  And I want to stress the importance to you guys that tools do not tell the truth.  Okay?  These tools are not accurate.  Let me repeat that.  These tools are not accurate.  And so you're not going to take these at face value.  The reason that we're using tools is we want to look at comparisons.  Okay?  We want to see, all right, for example, we have, maybe there's a project that you've  done in Minnesota, Minnesota Tree Service or Minnesota Concrete, okay?  Or not Minnesota, sorry, Minneapolis, Minneapolis Concrete, Minneapolis Tree Service.  And you can then in your head, let's say you've ranked that website, you're in the maps, everything's  fine and dandy.  And you can look at the tools, let's say you're using Mangools.  Well, Mangools tells you that there's only, you know, 50 people searching for Tree Service  in Minneapolis and you're ranked number one and you're ranked number one in the maps and  you're getting a hundred calls a month.  So therefore we can infer or we can interpret that if Mangools tells us it's 50, it's probably  close to a hundred.  So I want to be very clear that these tools are not accurate.  The tool does not matter.  What matters, guys, is that we're consistent with the tool that we use.  Okay, so I'm going to use SEMROSH, SEMROSH, I don't even know how they say it, that's  how much I care about tools.  Just pick one, okay?  Don't overthink it.  If you want something free, use Google Keyword Planner, it's fine.  That's step one.  Step two is what we're going to do is we're going to take a project that you have ranked  number one in the maps for most of the top terms and number one organically, okay?  And that's for a couple of months.  Now some of you guys are going to go, well, I'm brand new to this, I've never done that.  If that is the case, or if you have other projects and you just want to make this easy,  I'm going to let you use one of mine to do the following exercise.  So what we're going to do is we're going to take",

    "pageContent": "a site that's been ranking for years  and we're going to in our heads go, okay, this site based on data has produced this  many leads.  So the site that we're going to use is the trusty old Bentonville Concrete, which I am  ranking top in the maps, top in the organic, and I've done this for years and years.  And this site has consistently produced between 20 and 35 leads pretty much every month for  the past three years, two and a half, three years, okay?  So what we want to do is we want to take your tool.  So let's, in my case, I'm going to use SEMrush, right?  So I'm going to go to SEMrush or SEMrush, I'm not even sure how to say it, and I'm going  to type in Bentonville Concrete, okay, and I'm going to see what it says.  So this tool tells me, it tells me there's 40 volume, okay?  In fact, let me go and check recently what we've gotten here, give me a second here.  Because what's, and this is going to be an interesting point, okay.  So let me just give you an example here.  It's June 14th at the time of recording this.  We got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, literally one  a day, okay?  So we can pretty easily estimate that, you know, according to this, that's actually fairly  accurate.  Last month, we can go to May, well, this, you know, this is actually going to be changing  it.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18,  19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40,  41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, okay.  So here's a couple of interesting things.  Number one is this is not accurate because this has changed.  Just for the record, since I started doing this, this has changed.  The data has changed.  This part of the country has gotten a big influx of people.  There's a lot of building going on, huge building boom.  This didn't used to say 40, just so you know.  And also, you guys are going to laugh because this also used to be about $2 cost per click.  There's been a lot of people jump into the space.  There's been a lot of competitors, a lot of people running ads, and so this has changed.  But I still want you to see that even though this says 40, I'm actually getting more than  40 leads, okay.  I'm getting about 1.25 to every time it says 4.  So if this says 40, it's probably closer to 50, okay.  We can kind of assume based on this.  And if I want to check maybe one more month, you know, I could go and do that.  Look at April.  And I've got three pages.  That looks like it's a pretty accurate estimate.  We're probably getting 50 to 60 leads at this point.  And it's funny because",

    "pageContent": "that's how long it's been since I've checked it.  So we're going to just base, basically anything that SEM rush says, we're going to, and again,  this isn't perfect.  We're just going to assume that anything SEM rush says or SEM rush says, it's going to  be about 1.25 to whatever it says, okay.  So now we've got our baseline.  If you guys want to use my Bentonville concrete project as a baseline, great.  If you want to use something else, that's great.  The point is we want to find a ratio.  We want to see what it says with this one compared to another one.  And guys, if you have multiple projects, I would highly encourage you to look at this  on multiple projects so you can get a good baseline number so that, okay.  And you guys might type this into keyword planner and it's going to say 10.  And you're going to know, okay, every time it says 10, it's probably closer to 50, okay.  And that's what I want you guys to look at is we want to have that baseline.  We got to come up with that baseline ratio to say, okay, when it says this, it actually  is 1.25 of whatever it says, okay.  So that's step two.  Now let's get into the fun stuff, all right.  What I'm going to have you guys do now that we've gotten a baseline, which according to  SEMrush, you're going to use this, it's probably going to be about 1.25 to whatever it says.  I'm now going to go over to this little tool that's free.  It's called Google Trends, okay.  Step three.  We're going to go to Google Trends.  You're going to type it in, in your whatever search bar and click on it.  And what you're going to do is you're going to plug in your main keyword.  So I'm going to, and it doesn't need to be the main one, it could be a main one.  So let's just do concrete, do concrete contractors.  I would do concrete, but concrete also encompasses ready mix concrete, a bunch of different stuff,  people that do projects with concrete.  So I'm going to do concrete contractors because that's somebody that is most likely looking  for somebody to pour concrete, okay.  So that's what you're going to do is you're going to type in concrete contractors.  And what this tool is going to do is it's going to tell you what states have the highest  search volume in the United States for this specific term.  And by the way, you guys can use this in different countries, et cetera, okay.  So you're going to go, and this is how you're going to pick a state because what I don't  want you to do is look at a map and just throw a dart.  Now if you live in a city, and I do want to mention this really, really briefly.  This is a really important point.  Do not go into California, okay.  Do not go into California.  If you live in California and you're targeting your backyard or if you have projects already  that you've built, I don't want you to get discouraged.  You can still make money, but I'm telling you right now, there is a lot easier money  to make outside of California.  And this is coming from experience, from calling, cold calling, this is coming from experience  knocking doors.  This is coming from experience of traveling there.  There is just a certain vibe, a certain distrust that happens in that state and it's not worth  your time, okay.",

If you're going to get dinged on, you know, oh, your licensing isn't done or you don't  have this on your site or whatever, it's going to be in California, mark my words.  So if you have not built sites already, avoid the state.  Not because I don't like it.  I've got friends that live there, I go there a couple of times a year, we've got Disneyland  season passes baby, I'll go there all day long.  But for business, for this type of stuff, avoid California.  I don't know how much I need to emphasize that.  And also if you have projects, if you live there and have projects, it's okay.  You can still make money.  I'm just telling you going forward, okay.  So what you're going to do is you're going to go here, you're going to type in your main  term and you're going to select a state.  Now one word of caution, one little thing I want to mention when you're selecting a  state is think about this year round.  I don't want, you know, a really, really cold state where it's going to get icy blizzard  cold and no one can pour concrete.  So for example, I'm probably not going to hit South Dakota, okay.  It's going to do really well in the summer, maybe okay in the spring, good in the spring,  good in the fall.  In winter, I'm going to lose my client, okay.  Or I'm going to have to really do some kind of a deal where they stay on with me.  So what I like to do is I like to go through these top states and I like to look at ones  just intuitively, okay, that one's not as cold, right.  So for example, like Utah, I know it's really cold in some parts of state, but where I live,  it never gets cold.  So there's literally the city I live in never gets cold.  I have palm trees, people have swimming pools, it's stucco, okay.  Tennessee that'd be a great example.  That one gets cold, but not crazy cold.  South Carolina, decent, right, or I don't know, not Oregon.  North Carolina would be okay, but it still gets kind of cold.  But I'm talking more like the Florida's, right.  Florida never gets cold, relatively speaking.  Nevada never gets cold, relatively speaking.  Texas does get cold, but not as bad.  It's not like, you know, there's always snow.  So just keep that in mind.  And what I'm going to do is I want you guys to, I'm going to tell you the state I'm going  to go into, but I just want to give you ideas.  This is a good way to narrow down states and give you ideas.  What you can do is once you select a state, you can then, if you want city ideas, you  can actually click on the state and typically it will tell you the highest searched cities  or areas within that state, which is a really cool thing to do, okay.  But you also can, can rest assured that if there's a lot of searching, there's probably  a lot of competition.  So what I want you to do is just use this tool to pick a state.  And for this example, for this training, I'm going to use the state of Arizona.  Why?  I live close to it.  Utah does kind of I've been there.  I have multiple projects there.  It's warm most of the",

And so what I want you to do is once you select your state, I want you to go type in, you  know, Arizona cities by population.  Okay.  And you're going to just click on one of the links.  Doesn't matter.  And what I want you to do from there is go down and start about like the 50,000 or so  population.  Okay.  I want to work from the bottom up because I want to go.  Guys, I want you to realize this.  I want to choose the smallest population city that still meets the minimum requirements  for demand.  And that's the city I want to target because think about all the big guys, think about  the big companies, the big budgets and the big crews and all the money.  They want to go into the big cities.  Right.  So in Arizona, you know what they want to go into?  They want Phoenix.  They want Tucson.  They want Mesa.  They want Flagstaff.  Whatever.  I don't know.  I don't even know what Flagstaff is.  They want the big cities that you can see on the map.  I don't.  I want cities.  No one's looking at.  I want to be obscure with my city selection because no one's doing it.  And I'm going to kind of cheat the system here because I know a city that's going to  crush it because I've got other projects and other niches in the city.  But I want to show you what I would do.  So from here, what you would do is you would select cities starting at 50 K and you would  work your way up.  So we're going to take Maricopa and you're going to go back over to your tool and you're  going to type in your main keyword or one of them and then type in the city and state  abbreviation.  Okay.  So Concrete Contractors Maricopa, Arizona.  And we're going to see if it pulls any volume and it does 50.  Great.  Awesome.  We're good to go and we're just going to leave it.  Then we're going to go to the next one.  Okay.  So the next one is going to be Catalina Foothills.  So I'm going to go over here.  Sam Rush.  I'm going to type in Concrete Contractors.  Catalina Foothills AZ.  Did I spell that right?  Probably not.  Catalina.  Yes, I did.  Okay.  Now, if you do the first term, don't give up.  Do some variation.  So try just Concrete.  Okay.  Nothing.  Try getting rid of Arizona.  Be careful when you get rid of this abbreviation because sometimes multiple cities, there's  the same name city multiple states.  Make sure you're not looking at the wrong state.  I'll try doing Catalina Foothills Concrete, you know, opposite order.  And I'm just not seeing anything.  I'll try one more.  Okay.  So this one's kind of one of those where I'm just going to assume there's not a ton of  volume.  Okay.  And so I'm going to just, it is what it is.  Okay.  Next one.  And this is the one that I'm going to actually go into, which is Queen Creek.  I've built projects here.  This is an up and coming city.  I've got this like information from clients.  They're",

    "pageContent": "like, this city is growing like crazy.  It's awesome.  It's going to keep expanding.  So I'm, I already knew before I did this, this was going to be a good city.  And so I did concrete Queen Creek, Arizona.  Lo and behold, there's 30 volume and we are good to go.  So what I want you to look at, I'm going to type in concrete contractors, Queen Creek AZ.  So it doesn't pull a lot for the concrete contractors.  Let me do concrete patio.  No, let's try Queen Creek concrete.  Okay.  We know there's a term.  Give me a sec here.  Okay.  Concrete.  So the only one that's pulling volume is the concrete Queen Creek.  So that's something to note is it does pull volume, but it's lower than Bentonville concrete  and it doesn't pull volume for every term, but it might just be the perfect one.  So then what you're going to do is now we've looked at a couple of cities and you guys,  you might have to do this for 10.  Okay.  You're going to want to do this at least five, uh, probably five to 10 cities and you're  just going to look at the cities and just see what they say when you add the city and the state  abbreviation to the end of the term.  Okay.  So I want you to start at the 50 K population, work your way up and see which cities do that.  And then what I want you to do guys is you're going to select the city based on the following.  You're going to look at these and here's the criteria that it has to match.  Yes, it has to have volume.  I recommend it having volume within at least 10 of what Bentonville concrete had, which  Bentonville concrete was 40.  So this one right here is it's got to be at least within 10 or, or more.  Right.  So this one fits the bill because it's 50.  This one does not fit the bill because it's zero and this one fits the bill because it's  really close.  It's 30, but here's the kicker.  And this is something I've talked about over and over and over again.  We have to pay attention to the cost per click.  This is the CPC.  For those of you that don't know what that is, that is when you go to Google and you  type in concrete Phoenix.  And these people at the top, you see how this says ad.  And I know some of you guys like this is very basic guys, just relax.  It's something to remind everyone about.  You see how these say ads.  These right here, people are paying per click.  That's why it's cost per click.  So me as a consumer, if I click on this ad right now, if I push click, which I'm not  going to do, it is going to charge this company, whatever the amount it costs in Phoenix.  So if we want to look, this is probably not going to be 100% accurate, but let's just  look for fun.  So let's just do concrete Phoenix.  And it's going to be higher, I would assume, than the other ones.  Actually, it's not bad, believe it or not.  Not bad.  374.  I'm actually really shocked, but you know what else is interesting?  There's only 30 people searching for it.  That's weird.  Okay, go to concrete companies in Phoenix.  You got 210, ton of volume, and it's got CPC, but here's what you also got to",

    "pageContent": "realize.  You also have to have your intuition play into this and realize these tools aren't  necessarily accurate.  Guys, everyone's going to want to rank for Phoenix.  I promise you that.  And so I'm just telling you, when we go into the next steps, which is actually assessing  and looking at the competition, my intuition tells me it's probably going to be really  competitive.  So you're going to look at these different cities and you're going to make sure, and  you're going to find one that has at least within 10 or more of what Bentonville Concrete  is, which is 40 search volume, according to SEMrush on this tool.  And then you got to make sure it has a CPC of less than $5, but more than zero.  If the CPC is $0, $0 cost per click, you can safely assume that that traffic is worth  nothing because no one else wants it.  So why would I, right?  So for example, in this one, yeah, cool.  There's 50 people searching for it.  It says, but no one's actually bidding on it.  No one's paying for clicks, which tells me it's probably worth nothing.  So I've, and I've tested this, guys, you're not going to get like, for some reason, it  just doesn't work.  So if it says zero, it doesn't work.  If it says 10, it typically doesn't work.  And I'm telling you right now, if I was doing Bentonville Concrete today, I would repeat  this.  I would not go into Bentonville Concrete today, but when I'm telling you, when I did this  a couple of years ago, it was like two bucks.  Okay.  Now, luckily I'm ranked organically, so this doesn't matter, but I would not be going into  Bentonville Concrete today.  When I did a couple of years ago, it was not this competitive.  Okay.  Thanks to me, it is.  So from these searches, we are now going to identify two or three cities that have volume.  Excuse me.  They have volume that's within 10 of Bentonville Concrete or whatever city you choose that's  got at least 30, 40, 50 leads per month or more, and it has a CPC of less than $5, but  greater than zero.  Okay.  So quick, quick, quick, quick recap.  Okay.  Number one, you are going to go and you're going to pick a tool.  Step one.  Okay.  Doesn't matter what it is.  Paid, free, don't care.  You're going to go figure out what the baseline is.  What I mean by that is pick a project that's ranking that you know is getting leads and  it's been getting leads for years and years organically, and you know how many leads it's  getting.  If you don't have one, use Bentonville Concrete and figure out how that compares to what the  tool says.  That's your baseline.  Okay.  So that's number two.  Step three is you're going to use Google Trends to identify a state to start with.  Okay.  If you have a state in mind, awesome, but if you don't know and you're in a new niche  or whatever, go pick a state.  From there, you're going to type into Google state plus cities in population with population,  order of population, whatever.  So Arizona cities by population.  Utah cities by population.  And you're going to then start at 50,000, go to the bottom, start at 50,000, put those  into your tool with the",

Okay, beautiful.  Let's see, Isaac, sorry, Aaron, would you just keep an eye on the people that join?  Absolutely. Okay, awesome. Okay, so real quick guys, welcome to the call first and foremost. Secondly,  if you guys, there are a few people in here that I recognize that are inside of our program,  which is cool, and I'm going to just mention this really quick because there are a couple.  One of the biggest questions that people have had recently, it seems like for the past six months,  is what is the minimum search volume for a keyword plus city that would indicate that this city,  you can go into the city? What's the bare minimum search volume? That's a very frequently asked  question. Would you not agree with that, Aaron? Definitely. And we've purposely, when we first  started talking about this stuff, when we first started our program back in 2021, I was using,  I had been using SEMrush or SEMrush for years. And so I was like, okay, this is what I use,  whatever. But the problem with that is that that tool is all over the place, right? And  let's just be honest, every single tool is. And so basically what we said and we've been saying,  and I still stand by it, is that whatever tool you want to use, whether it's Google Keyword  Plan or Mangools, SEMrush, blah, blah, blah, blah, whatever you want to use, you need to just find a  baseline for what is a, you know, you take a website, for example, that's ranking.  Let's say I have Bentonville Concrete. I always use that example because I know exactly how many  leads I get every month. It's ranking for GMB. It's ranking for organic for the major seven  keywords, basically. And I know how many leads I get. And then I look at what the tool says.  And based on that, I can set kind of like a baseline. So that's going to be our advice.  That's what I've been saying. So I've been using. And the reason why we haven't said,  hey, this is the tool that says this, et cetera, is because we haven't really wanted to  basically endorse any tool. But anyway, all I'm saying now is that we have been working on  something for like, I think it's been about 15, 16 months where we're pulling data directly from  Google to show that search volume. That's one of the functions it does. It also does like the due  diligence in, what is it, like three seconds, Aaron? Two and a half, baby.  Yeah, it's ridiculous. So I used to spend 30 to 45 minutes on a due diligence. Now you literally  put in the keywords. It's honestly three seconds. So by the way, I'm going to take care of that one  that just tried to join. Oh, sorry. I think I, okay, cool. Okay. Anyway, guys, for those of you  that weren't on my, if you are in digital landlords, you have no idea what I'm talking  about most likely. If you guys are curious about what that is, we are doing the beta test for that.  We've had some really good feedback so far. I've been playing around a lot with the tool.  So DM, just DM me actually privately, because I'll send you the information on that,  because I'm going to send you a recording that we",

And with that said, I think let's get into the call. Happy freaking Monday.  Here's what I want to do in the chat really quick. In the next, let's just say the next six weeks,  okay, the next six weeks. So from mid October to the 1st of December, how, and I want everyone to  respond on this guys. How much revenue top line are you guys going to add to your business? Now,  I'm not talking about your goal, but I'm talking about, I always call this your die goal or your  junkie goal, which is if you don't, you're going to hit this number or like I'm flinging myself off  of a bridge type of thing, which is a little bit much, but I'm just trying to paint the picture  here. Like that is the goal that I'm hitting no matter what, no matter what. How much are you guys  going to add each one of you guys? Yeah, not your goal, but your actual, like I am going to do this.  Kurt's going for 10k. I love that. Who else? Who else in six weeks? You got six weeks to do it.  Who else is going to do 20? Oh, okay. I thought I said 25. I was like, dude,  Jahill's going in dude. He's got the, he's sipping the coffee this morning. 2k. I want everyone to  give me a, he's laughing. I want everyone to give me a 500k. There we go. No big deal.  Everybody tell me, I want to know Shane Noble, 2,500 bucks. That's two deals. Could be one deal.  Steph, Stephen, sorry, 2,500. Doug, 2k. Who we missing? I want to know what Stephanie says. Stephanie,  we've missed a couple people. I think her audio is still connecting. Yeah. Okay. No problem. Shane,  I'm new. Currently saving for digital landlords. Okay. Beautiful. Shane, by the way, shoot me a  message after. Might have something interesting for you because we're a created bunch over here  and it sucks to be sitting there waiting. So shoot me a message after Shane. So guys, 10k,  2k, 25. By the way, Kurt is in China. Is that correct? Am I right on that, Kurt?  That's beautiful. So he's going to sling 10k from China. That's the power of the internet, baby.  Guys, my agency, I don't really spend a ton of time in it personally. I've kind of advised  Francesca, but we're going to do the same thing. We're going to go and add another 10k in the next  six weeks. And I'm going to try something that's going to be slightly different than I've done in  the past. I've had a few different months and little sprints where we've done 10k added revenue  and there's no better feeling. What I would recommend you guys doing is setting a goal  from now until the 1st of December. And if you hit it, you're going to treat yourself to something,  not anything crazy, but just have that goal. Get excited. I know that this time of year,  a lot of people take their foot off the gas. A lot of people are like, I'm prepping for the  holidays. I got Thanksgiving, whatever. And that's exactly why you should have your foot on the gas ",

It means that for me, when I know that no one else is up doing stuff, I'm more motivated than  if I know everyone is. And I promise you that half the people that are doing this right now or more  are going to be taking their foot off the gas and they're going to be saying, oh, it's Christmas.  I'm going to start the 1st of the year. So also if you're thinking, oh my gosh, my business owners,  they're not going to be hungry. Guess what? The hungry business owners are still doing business.  The hungry business owners are still making moves. It's basically going to be this filter for the  people you don't want to work with anyway because we all know those business owners that you call  and they're like, well, I'm not doing anything until like March. That's not someone you want  to work with anyway. So anyway, guys, I truly, in fact, let's do this. Aaron, I want you to  screenshot every answer that we just got. And I want, when we get to the 1st of December,  whoever hits their goal that they put in here, I want you to message me and remind me. And I've  got something for you guys. Okay. And you can hold me to that. You guys can hold me to that. Okay.  All right. Let's do this again, guys. I'm going to talk about five mistakes  that cost me literally, I told Aaron in the title of this to say hundreds of thousands of dollars  because when you say millions, it sounds like you're just using that as like some catch  whatever. It sounds kind of cliche, but I would definitely say millions. Now that I got you guys  on the call, but we wanted to say hundreds of thousands, but I genuinely can trace back  millions of dollars lost off of these five mistakes. Okay. So I'm going to go through  these five mistakes and then any questions you guys have on them, I'm going to expand on them a bit.  And then also we're going to have a little bit of time for Q&A. Okay.  Okay. Let me just shut my door. Kids are still sleeping. Hold on.  Okay. Everyone can still hear me, right? Give me a thumbs up if we can.  Yeah. Beautiful. Okay. Guys, I hope you guys are pumped about digital real estate. I know sometimes  when you get in the game for a while, I see some names I've seen for a long time.  You know, sometimes you get in that you go from honeymoon stage, like some of you guys are new  to this and the honeymoon stage is so exciting. You know, it's new, it's fresh. The idea of you  being able to make money while you're golfing, while you're traveling, while you're doing whatever,  it's exciting and it's fun because it's just the idea and you don't have to do anything. And then  once you get into the actual game, you're like, oh my gosh, this is going to take work. I'm going  to have to do X amount of due diligence before I even find my first city. And it becomes kind of  heavy and you get kind of weighed down in the minutiae. But I just want you guys to know that  I've been weighed down in the minutiae since 2016. And I've had times when I was way more  excited about this. I had times when I was way less excited, but I can honestly tell you that  this should tell you that this business model is what it is. And it's the most  simplest business model on the internet",

I know it sounds like I'm making that up or it  sounds cheesy, whatever, but I was thinking about adding another $10,000 before December 1st.  I actually want to do that in 30 days, but that's what I was thinking about last night. I've been  doing this for eight freaking years. I've made millions of dollars doing this, but the idea that  I could just go, Aaron, you can control the mute, right? Yeah. Beautiful. The idea that I can just  go and add $10,000. Now let's call that $10,000. Let's say it's six of net, right? Just because of  ads or whatever. And the fact that I can just go add a casual $6,000 to my bottom line per month,  what is that? What's six times 12, Aaron? Give us the details. 72. 72. Okay. It's a little early.  Don't ask me that question. If it's a nine, I got you on the multiplication. But so you guys,  the fact that you can go and add 70, Kurt said he's going to add $10,000 in six weeks. You can  go and add $72,000 to your bottom line just because you decided to. And it's not ongoing,  it's not like one of these businesses like SMMA where it's like, okay, I just got  10 new clients. I have 10 times the work. It's like, no, maybe you got 10 new clients and you  did a lot of work for 60 days and then the work goes completely down and all you have to do is  maintain it. Anyway, I don't know how you can't get excited about this. I'm pumped about it. I'm  going to do another 10K of added revenue to my agency, not obviously to my program, just to my  agency and I'm super pumped about it. So I hope you guys are pumped about it because I'm really  excited about it. Even here, eight years later, coming up on the holidays, I couldn't be more  excited about the holidays because no one else is going to be doing it and I am. Okay. So guys,  five things that have literally cost me hundreds of thousands of dollars. I would definitely say  millions, but let's go through these really, really quick and then we'll get into some Q&A.  Okay. Number one, and these are in no particular order. These are just as I was sitting there and  pondering, I'm like genuinely speaking, if I was having a conversation, me and Aaron were on a  road trip, we're driving to Phoenix and he's like, Hey, what's cost you the most money?  And I was sitting there and actually not just giving him an answer out of my back pocket,  but I was giving him an answer that I truly felt were the things that cost me that money.  These are the things I would say. Okay. Number one is not having my due diligence dialed. Okay.  Now, what I mean by that is not having my formula of what is a good city and niche combination.  Okay. Not having that perfect, not having that dialed that has cost me. I don't even know how  I would calculate how much money that's cost me. Okay. And what happened to me in the beginning,  guys, is I was so excited to get going. I was so excited to get started doing this,  just like many of you are that you want to just take a city, you pick a niche,  you go, you build whatever. And by the way, keep",

    "pageContent": "in mind, I was doing this the slow way  because I didn't know there was another way to do this. And for those of you,  if there's anyone on here that doesn't know what I mean by slow way, I'm talking about actually  doing rank and rent, building a website, waiting for six months to rank and then going and selling  it. So I was doing that. And I didn't even know there was an option that you could go and you  could pre-sell it. You could go and get a deal this week and then build it out and know for sure  that you have someone that's willing to pay. Okay. I didn't know any of that. And so keep in mind,  I didn't even have a due diligence process that was dialed in. I wasn't confident in it.  I was taking this advice from a group that was, I believe, a bit antiquated. And I just started  building sites. And the advice that I got, guys, was just keep building sites, build 10, build 20,  just keep building sites. And the justification that these people were giving me was, hey,  if you build 10 sites, even if seven of them don't work and only three of them hit, the numbers still  work. And it's like, okay, that's cool because these things are so cheap to build. But I don't  have six months to wait for each project to see if it's going to work. And I also don't want to pay  for hosting for six months on a website in a niche in a city that I'm never going to do. That's a  waste of time and money. And so guys, for me, I made the mistake of just going too quick. And it's  hard because I'm a big believer of just taking action before you have all the answers. But this  piece of it, guys, the due diligence piece is one you don't want to mess up, okay? I'm all about  going and taking action, starting the podcast before you have the cover art or before you have  the intro, making the cold call before you have the exact script, just taking action. But guys,  for you to commit to a six month project at the bare minimum, based on not knowing exactly what  the due diligence needs to look like, what the metrics, what the formula needs to look like,  that is financial suicide. And I have done it. And I've done it on both sides, right? I've  done it in the right niche, but not had my city dialed and not known exactly what a city looks  like and just being so concerned about population because somebody told me that I should look at  population and thinking, okay, I can only work with cities between $300,000 and $700,000 or  whatever it was. And having the right niche, but not knowing what a city looks like, not knowing  what the competition looks like, not even looking at cost per click or any of those kinds of things  and building, building, building, building in the right niche, but the wrong city. And then on the  flip side, I've done the opposite where I've, you know, I've gone into the wrong city and niche.  And I remember this specific time, guys, we, we had this client in foundation repair. Okay.  And we, I don't even know how we necessarily got into it in the very beginning. I think it  was kind of an accident and we got this deal in this city and it worked. It was like this  miraculous event. It worked. We didn't even know what we were doing. We picked the city,  the niche worked only because we had a good business owner and it was very, very not  competitive and everything",

So  people that were spending big dollars, we're, we're going against companies that were so big,  they had their own internet marketing companies within the company. That was a separate entity  that just serviced their freaking companies. I mean, it was ridiculous and we got our butts  handed to us. We, we built over 50 websites for one, there was one client that was like,  Hey, let's just go hard. We're like, yeah, let's go hard. So we're like, all right,  we'll build 50 websites. We agreed again, another mistake I'm going to get to in a second.  We agreed to a pay per lead deal, which is a huge mistake that we did. And that's actually number two  I'm going to get into. And we got our butts handed to us to the point that I thought there was going  to be like some serious, I just thought it was going to be a bad deal. Luckily, the guy ended  up being cool. We, we didn't, we didn't have any kind of like, you know, guarantees. We were pretty  good on expectations. So it didn't, it wasn't as bad as it thought. We had some really heated  conversations, some really pissed. It was just a bad deal. And this was all because I didn't have  my due diligence dial. Okay. So the next question people will be asking, well, how do I, what's the  right due diligence? How do I pick a city? How do I pick a niche? You got two ways. Okay. What I did  is I spent, you know, it took me a good solid four years of trial and error. Now the crazy part is,  is I actually have spent about $23,000 on programs. And, and I, this is by the year of 2020.  Okay. I spent $23,000 on programs. That's just rank and rent programs. And I still didn't have  the due diligence process dialed in because all the ones that I bought, those people were not in  the game. They were not, you know, like, for example, we just barely gave her a proposal.  My agency, Evergreen, on Thursday morning, was it Thursday morning or Friday morning?  It was Thursday morning. Thursday morning, we just gave her a proposal. It's, we gave an option  proposal. It was for 7,500 or $10,000 per month. Okay. 75. So either option is going to be a  fat chunk added. By the way, I'm not thinking, if you guys think that I'm like sandbagging this,  that's not even what I'm thinking about in terms of this extra 10K. That deal to me is dead because  they didn't do it on the call. It was an interesting deal because we had to talk to the marketing  director who doesn't actually have the power to get on the call, to make the decision, but you're  not going to get the owner on that call. So it was kind of one of those weird, bigger companies,  but that I'm, that deal's dead to me. So when I say $10,000 additional by December 1st,  I'm not even talking about that, but guys, we just did a proposal for 7,500 or",

    "pageContent": "$10,000,  like four days ago. That's how much I'm in this game, right? I'm doing this every day. I'm looking  at new niches. I'm talking, I'm voice noting Francesca constantly all day. What about this?  What about this? And so to keep in mind that I was working with people and I was in programs and  groups and none of those people were in the game, right? They did this once or twice or five times.  They made 10,000 bucks. They had a good month and made 20,000 bucks. And then they're like,  I'm going to go make a program. And the training was antiquated. It was never solved in the first  place because they didn't really have a tried and true system. And I was following these advice and  these different due diligence processes. And it got me into a lot of trouble. Okay. So you have  two options. You can do what I did, which is kind of like flail around and spend four years and take  advice from people that haven't done it or try to figure it out on your own, or you can buy time  and you can go and get the due diligence process from somebody that has done it. And I think you  guys know where you can get that. Okay. All right. So number one is not having my due diligence dialed.  I always talk about this. I'll keep talking about this. Getting your city and niche dialed is the  most important, is the single most important step in the process. Yes, getting the credit card is  where it all ends or I guess it's where it begins, but it's where that deal is finalized. But you're  never going to get to that point without picking the right city and niche. And even if you do get  to that point, and even if you do get the deal, that deal is going to eventually die. If you're  in the wrong city in the niche, in the wrong niche, because you're never going to rank your, your,  your leads are going to be expensive. Like it's, this part is so vital and I, I, I can't stress it  enough. Okay. All right. Number two, the number two reason, the number two thing that I, number  two mistake that I made that cost me hundreds of thousands of dollars was doing pay per lead  instead of flat fee. Now I have an entire YouTube video, maybe even two or three YouTube videos on  this, but when I started in my mind, I always inherently knew that doing a commission deal was  a bad idea. Right. And by the way, just so we're on the same page, doing a commission deal, meaning  I'll send you leads. Let's say Aaron's my tree service guy. I'm going to send Aaron leads.  He's going to pay me nothing except for a percentage of the deals that he closes. Okay. And  usually they want to not only do that, but they want to pay you the net percentage. They want to  say, Oh, I'm not even going to pay you on gross. I'm going to pay you on net. Like they want to  have zero skin in the game. And these groups that I was in guys, a lot of people were doing  commission deals and you know, they would make some money and I would see that, but in my mind,  it just didn't make sense. I was like, the business owner has no skin in the game.  Why would the business owner, if I send them leads, why would they be incentivized to even  answer my leads? If they have my lead or they have their lead, they're for sure going to take their  lead because they're going to make the",

    "pageContent": "full rip on their lead and not on mine. Right. So why would  they even do it on top of that? Why would they, why would they be honest? Why like what's in it?  What's in it for them to be honest? And then I'm like, even if they are, I'm going to go and check  all this. So I always knew commission was not a good idea, but here's where I made the mistake  is I thought that the best, what's the correct term? The best deal structure was the paper lead  model. And the reason why is because in my mind, I was like, all right, I'm always the person that  will bet on themselves. I'll always be the one that if you give me the option and say, Hey,  I'll give you this guaranteed amount of money, right? Let's say that you're offering me a job  or whatever. And you say, Hey, Nick, I'll either give you this guaranteed amount of money or I'll  give you a commission based on your performance. I'm always going to take the commission based on  performance. I'm always going to take the one that that's betting on myself. And so I took that same  logic into this business. But I, what I didn't realize guys is that a paper lead model is never  going to be based on your performance. You think it is. And on paper, a paper lead model would be  this. Aaron is the tree service owner and Aaron is going to pay me for exactly how many leads I  send him. Sounds amazing, right? Because it sounds like, Hey, if I just go and I get my SEO ranked  or I get my SEO dialed, I get my website ranked for these extra keywords and I can add another,  you know, another five leads per month at a hundred bucks a rip, that's an extra $500.  That's on me. I can make an extra 500 bucks this month, right? It sounds amazing. It sounds like  there's no ceiling. It sounds like the holy grail of holy grails. But what you don't think about guys  is that these business owners have limits. These business owners don't all think big. These  business owners, when you hit a certain number of leads, they start to freak out. When their bill  starts to get to a certain amount of money, they start to freak out. They don't have the ability  to expand that quickly. They don't have the mind to think that big. And so what ends up happening  is you end up getting to this threshold that you don't even know about. And there will be a month  that happens. And, you know, I mean, here's the exact what happened to me is I got, I had this deal  and we were doing a hundred dollars per lead. Okay. Business owner was cool. We had this really good  arrangement. He was good at closing. And he was, you know, we started and it was like roughly  around a thousand bucks, getting about 10 leads per month. And he was cool. And we were doing that  and we're doing that and we're doing that. And then all of a sudden my SEO, like one month,  it just kind of clicked. I wasn't running ads. I wasn't doing any of that, but everything just  kind of worked. It was either that or the weather or something happened. But my leads like tripled  in a month. And that invoice that I send him every single month for a thousand bucks, I sent him an  invoice. It was like three grand. And not only did he not pay it, but he went through and he wanted  to know the name, you know, he wanted to double check. Was each lead, you",

Did they go, like when they went to the house, were they, all these things that I  couldn't control, right? To the point where he was trying to get me to take leads, billable leads  off of this invoice because he would tell them, hey, I'm backed out, you know, two months on work  and they, he would lose, they wouldn't even want an estimate. And then he would say, well, that's  not, I don't want that lead. I'm like, bro, that's your business. You need to hire more people. You  need to be more efficient. That's not me. And, you know, we kind of came to a middle ground,  but it just, I tarnished the relationship. So what you don't realize about paper lead guys,  is there is a threshold for all business owners. And when they hit it,  you may not even know just, just for the record. Hold on one second. Okay. You may not even know,  but you will, at the end of the month, they will let you know. And it's, it's just a pain.  Not only that guys, you have to calculate the, you know, okay, how much is it per lead  and how many leads did we send? Go ahead and get 10, 15 clients guys. And you're,  you literally have to hire, I had to hire somebody to calculate those. And then they're a human and  then they're making mistakes. So then I went and I had a software guy build me a software from the  ground up that every lead, it would scrape the email. It would dump it into a glorified  Google sheet. Then it would calculate the cost per lead. And then it would link with QuickBooks  and it would send them an invoice. Dude, it was such a pain. And that was with software. Okay.  On top of that guys, how do you define a lead? What if it's a good lead, but the business owner  doesn't answer? Whose fault is that? Is that your fault? Is that their fault? What if it's somebody  that calls in, they're interested today, but then they cancel the appointment before the appointment?  Who pays for that? You or them? And there's all these variables. And so what I didn't realize  is all these variables. I also didn't realize that when people didn't close jobs, they would blame me.  Okay. And I had one guy, I mean, I've got stories for days, but I have one guy in a North, the  Northwest corner of the, of the U S I think it was in Seattle or it was either Seattle or Portland.  And this guy, he owed us like 10, 15,000 bucks. And we kept hounding them, hounding them, hounding  them. This is for, you know, 150 leads roughly. And which is another mistake that I made of not  collecting quicker, quick enough. But basically they called us one day, they had their mother-in-law  or something call us. I was like, Hey, the situation happened. The partner got arrested for this.  We're closing down the business and filing bankrupts. And sure enough, they did. We took  them to, you know, we sent them to collections and everything. We got the notice in the mail  that said they, you know, they went bankrupt. These are all things that happen because of  paper lead. So that said, guys, the Holy grail of Holy grails, the only way you should be doing  business is",

    "pageContent": "flat V deals. Don't be doing commission deals. Don't be doing paper lead deals. Don't be  doing, you know, a hybrid deal. The only scalable way to do it, predictable way to do it is a flat  V deal. Yes, on some of these deals, you're going to take a little bit less money, but you know what?  You can get the money. You can charge per week, charge per month, set it and forget it,  set expectations. Hey, Mr. Business Owner, some months are going to be better. Some months are  going to be worse. This is the amount. If we can double or triple what you spend as your ROI or as  the money that's coming back in, you have a great ROI. We'll keep working together. The only way I  was able to scale is when I switched to flat V deals. So do not make the mistake of doing paper  lead. And some of you guys might even be on this call right now going, well, I've got a deal. It's  paper lead. That's great. You have one deal. Okay. Go and scale that thing. Go get 30 clients with  the paper lead deal. And you go ahead and let me know how that goes. Cause I've tried it and it's,  it's, it's, it's bad. Okay. It's really bad. Okay. That's number two. Number one, not having my due  diligence style. Number two, not, sorry, doing paper lead instead of flat feet. Number three,  was obsessing over obscure niches instead of just sticking with the boring ones.  I heard this phrase so many times I could just go blue in the face saying it, but the riches are in  the niches. The riches are in the niches. The riches are in the niches. And of course, from the  people that weren't actually doing the model, they were just selling the program. They were just  selling the tools. They were just selling the hosting, all this different stuff. And the more  that I built the blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Like, of course you're telling me the riches are  in the niches because you want me to go build a website in a hundred different niches because  a hundred, a hundred hosting plans is great money for you. Okay. I don't make my money selling  hosting. I don't sell a white labeled platform. I don't sell done for you services, that kind of  stuff. So it benefits me nothing for you guys to go and build a bunch of websites. If anything,  it hurts me because then you guys are going to get discouraged and want to get out of the model.  Okay. So guys do not think that you can't make money in boring niches. Yes, there is money in  there. There's riches in niches for sure. There's riches in obscure niches, but it's not the only  way to make money. Okay. And the more predictable way to make money is to make money in the boring  niches first. And then you can start to, and I would, I would kind of like liken this to just  business in general, right? Let's say I want to start a business and I want to get rich,  which everybody does. I can have two strains of thought, right? I get two schools of thought.  Number one is I can do, there's riches in niches and I can sit there for 10 years trying to find  this business. That's just this, this niche business that no one's ever thought of. You know,  for example, one of my buddies, he, I don't know, maybe they're going to kill it, but he's like, ",

And this is one of those like,  always starting a new business kind of guy. He's like, it's a fan that you attach the top of a  porta potty. And I was like, cool, bro. Like, and again, this probably is a need, whatever,  but you got to know the guy to realize it's like, he's, he's spent now, he's, he's older than me.  He's probably spent 15 years now trying to think of the, the obscure niche, the obscure business  that's going to make him millions of dollars. And me, I went and I said, okay, what's a business  model that's tried and true? Rank and rent. Sounds good. Somebody else figured out, let me buy their  program. Boom, boom, boom. Yeah, I had to figure some stuff out, but that's a tried and true  business model. I did it. It didn't start off crazy, but I've now made millions and millions  of dollars. And now I have the confidence and I've looked at other opportunities. I see other  opportunities within this space even to go and I can go and, and now that I have the money coming  in, now that I'm, you know, secure financially, I can go and sit back and take my time and say,  huh, I wonder about that. I wonder about that. So my, my advice to anyone with business and,  and even, and for sure within this business is don't worry about being so obscure. Do the tried  and true until you get to a comfortable spot. Once you get to a spot where your bills are paid,  plus some, plus a lot, now you can sit back and you can start to take some moves that aren't going  to kill you, that aren't going to put you, set you back. Okay. So with this business,  go into the tried and true, go into the fencing, go into the masonry, go into the, the, the spray  foam installation, go into the, go into the stuff that everybody is telling you they're getting deals  in. Okay. That I'm telling you, I'm showing you live examples that I'm getting deals in.  And then once you get your bills paid, once you get out of the rat race, once you get to a certain  level, then you can start to look at, oh, let's try doing the, the yacht rentals or the yacht  charters, whatever, right? Something that's obscure like that. Let's see if this will work  with private jet companies, which is, you know, probably going to be an entirely different type.  Anyway, I sat and I was so obsessed with richer than the riches, richer than the riches. I started  building in every single niche. I spent so much time looking at different ideas. What about this?  What about this? Then guys, I had to go in and not only did I, I didn't know if the niche was  going to work because I'd never heard of anyone doing it, but then I also didn't know if the city  was going to work. So I had two variables that could kill me. So go into the tried and true,  go into the boring, get to your, you know, revenue point where you're comfortable,  and then you can worry about that. So the third thing that, that really cost me a lot of money,  cost me hundreds of thousands of dollars was obsessing over obscure niches. You don't need  to do",

Number four is not, this is the fourth thing  that cost me hundreds of thousands of dollars was not taking people's advice that had been there,  done that. And instead taking advice from people who had not been there and done that. Okay. Now  the reason I phrase it like that, which is kind of hard to even follow was I would have loved to  take someone's advice that had been there, done that. I would have loved to take someone's advice  that had made a hundred thousand dollars per month or had made $50,000 per month, or for heaven's  sake that had made $35,000 per month. But the person that I knew that had made the most amount  of money doing this, that the most they had made in a single month was like 20,000, 25,000 bucks.  And they weren't even in the game anymore. So it wasn't even credible. So I couldn't go to that  person and say, Hey, what do you think about this? What do you think about this update? What do you  think about this thing that Google's doing? What do you think about this? I couldn't, you know,  I did. And they were giving me their advice, but the advice was not correct or it wasn't up to date.  Okay. And some of you guys, I'm not pointing fingers and hopefully not all of you guys,  but I know some of you guys are taking advice from anyone and everyone. And that's the problem.  And I see this in the free group and I try to kill it as soon as possible, but I see all the time,  like, Hey, I got this landing page that it converts like crazy. DM me if you want it. First of all,  they're soliciting. I kick them out immediately. Second of all, I want to be like, Hey, before  you're allowed to post something like that, I want to see your Stripe account. I want to see,  you know, how much money you've made. I want to see your contracts. I want to see how long you've  been doing this. I want to see if you actually know what you're talking about. Okay. So guys,  you have to be, there's so much free information out there. There's so many people talking about  this. I know a couple of guys that live in the same city as me. Okay. These guys have never even  done rank and rent. And I know like, dude, they, I know this because they told me. They told me,  they bought a rank and rent program. They're like, yeah, we did use some of the SEO tactics  for our business. They were doing some solar sales. They're like solar bros. And then they  just decided to start a program and they're out there hawking a program for like 5,000 bucks.  And they've never even done it. So the question you guys need to ask every single time you're  going to take advice is, you know, what have you done in this business model exactly like this?  Not, not what have you made selling the course? Not what have you made selling a tool? Not what  have you made on social media? How much have you made doing rank and rent? Okay. That like period.  How much are you making now? Are you still in the game or did you check yourself out? Okay.  I can't stress this enough. It's whenever we use these examples of like the gym, the gym analogy,  like, of course,",

To put it nicely,  you wouldn't go. But, and that's obvious, right? Of course, when you're getting, you know, you're  going to go to somebody to, to manage your money, you wouldn't go to somebody that's completely  broke, right? And those things make sense to us. But for some reason, when it comes to this,  we don't even think about that. I'm not taking advice. There was this, there was this clip I  put on my Instagram. If you guys aren't following me there, I post a lot of rank and rent stuff.  You can follow me. It's at digital drug dealing is the handle. But I put this clip. It was Kanye  and Piers. Piers Morgan, I think is his name. And Kanye is like, Piers, how much money are you worth  or how much money do you make? And Piers is like, well, not as much as you. And Kanye is like,  well, then why should I listen to you? And it was like, he was, it was being an ass, but it was  funny. And it was really true because he's like, it's the truth. And Kanye is like, well, you  should listen to me about money and maybe make more money, right? So whoever you're going to take  advice from, that's your business. Just ask them. And even though I knew that inherently, and by the  way, just because they're making a little bit more than you, doesn't mean you should necessarily  follow what they're doing. Look at where you want to end up and don't take advice from anyone,  except for the people that are there. If you're looking to make at least $100,000 per month,  then you're going to have a very select group of people you're going to take advice from. Because  to get to 25K is a completely different thing than getting to 100K. And you're going to build  your business differently. You're going to scale differently. You're going to do all kinds of  different stuff differently. And in order to get 25K, the same thing that gets you to 25K is not  going to get you to 100K. So look at where you want to go eventually, where you want to end up,  and only take advice from people that are there. Okay? Here's my last thing that cost me. And this  was probably, if I were to give priority to any of them, if I were to say this is the most important  one, this is going to be the most, you guys are going to think I'm just saying this to be catchy,  but this is the advice that I heard. And it changed everything for me. It was at the perfect time.  And it was just great advice. And that is the thing that cost me so much money  was me being too smart. Okay? Me being too smart. Now, let me explain that. That doesn't mean that  I have like a super high IQ and it's like, oh my gosh, I can't believe my parents gave me such good  genes. No, I've never been accused. I've never been accused of being super too smart. Okay?  What I mean by that is being too smart. And I knew that this was working. I knew that something  was working and I was too smart to just do it again. Right? Instead of just being simple  and basic and saying, hey, this worked, let me just do it again and again and",

And I started getting too smart. Right? I started saying too much. I  started going into too many niches. I started offering too many services. I started thinking,  you know, I was too smart. And then I heard this advice. Somebody said to me,  if you've gotten a deal for $1,000 a month, why haven't you done that 100 times?  And it was such a simple thing that they said. And I was like, yeah, why haven't I? And I have  gotten a deal for $1,000 a month. So why don't I just get rid of everything else and just go get  100 of those? And that was a very great moment for me because I just like, it clicked. I was like,  I'm being too smart. I need to simplify. I need to be more basic. I need to be more simple.  I need to be more simple. John Wooden, baby. John Wooden, every single year,  he talked about the fundamentals. He would talk about just the basic, basic, basic stuff.  And that's because that's what wins basketball games. So in that same realm, a lot of times I  see people get a deal or for those of you that are in my program, there's a couple of you guys  that are in my program, the process is there. The recipe is there. The blueprint is there.  Don't get too smart. I'm not saying that I'm the most genius in the world, but if it works,  then why are we trying to change it? Once you get to your 10K, 15K, 20K,  you want to go and try and flip the model on its head like I did? That's cool. But if you know that  something's working, just do it until you get to a comfortable spot and then you can start worrying  about it. So let me go through this again, guys. Here's the five things that have cost me hundreds  of thousands of dollars, five mistakes. Number one is not having my due diligence dialed in.  Number two is doing paper lead instead of flat fee. Number three is obsessing over obscure  niches instead of just sticking with the boring ones. Number four is listening to the wrong people  and not listening to the people that were at the place I wanted to be. In my defense, I didn't know  anyone at that place. You guys do. You know somebody that's made at least $100,000 per month for  years. So that's a good start. Okay. And if there's somebody that's made more than me,  then go listen to them. Okay. And then number five, guys, is being too smart, not being simple.  There is so much power in being simple. There is so much growth that happens in being simple.  And that's in every area. I'll share this last example. And then if you guys have Q and I want  you guys to start dropping, I'm going to have Aaron go through",

    "pageContent": "it. But guys, this is even true.  I kind of went through this period where I simplified everything. I simplified my business.  I'm constantly trying to do that, right? And this happened to me with fitness too. In early 2020,  sorry, early 2022, I decided, you know what, I'm going to go, no, was it 2022? It was 2023,  I'm sorry. I decided, you know, this is going to be the year. I was 31 or 32. I can't remember  what it was. I can't remember, whatever. And I was like, I want to be in the best shape of my life.  I want to be less than 10% body fat. I want to look like this, whatever. And so I went out and  I was like, I'm going to find the person that has the body I want, that's my age, that doesn't do  steroids, you know, all the things. I want to make sure that they were as close to me as possible.  And I'm going to go and pay them. And I found the person. I went, I asked them how much they charge.  I said 20 grand. They don't do this. They said usually, they usually just sell their program,  but they'll do the one-on-one coaching. It's 20 grand. And I paid 20 grand for six Zoom calls.  Okay. Anyway, long story short, the craziest part about that whole process is that it worked  and it worked miraculously. And to this day, I've never been in better shape. And here's what's  crazy. The training regimen that he gave me and the diet plan that he gave me and the entire  schedule of everything that he gave me was so simple that I didn't believe him.  I was working out since I was 18. I'd been working out six days a week doing different muscle groups,  two muscles, one muscle, all kinds of different stuff, then doing cardio on the weekends. And  he's like, dude, you need to lift three times a week. And on top of that, you're only going to  lift five lifts on those three days. And I was like, there's no way I'm going to gain weight.  He's like, okay, well then don't change anything. Follow this nutrition and do this. And I promise  you guys it worked and it blew my freaking mind. It was like, I've had to put in less effort  mentally and honestly physically than I ever have. When I do it, I do it as hard as I can.  But it is very, my plan is so simple. I can text it to you like in this. The amount of workouts I  do is so simple. I can do it with just a basic garage gym. Okay. That's the power and simplicity.  All right, Aaron, do we have any questions? If not, then we don't have to go spending more time.  If Aaron, is he still on? Yes. So we have so far one question and this is coming from  Kirk, Kirk Dahlstrom. And so he actually just joined a few days ago.  Mr. China, Mr. Chinese living in China, which is crazy. Yeah, so cool. I think our first  Chinese resident. Anyway, but he this he's obviously a newbie because this is a pretty  basic question we can go over found a great city, but I'm finding another R&R site in the city,  big volume and low CPC, go for it and move on. So it's the all what I do. Yeah, go ahead and  answer Aaron. You know, these here's what's funny about Aaron, guys.",

    "pageContent": "If you ever see Aaron post in  the group, you can I'm going to put my stamp on it that you can just follow his advice. Now, number  one, because he's getting deals, he's got deals. Number two, because he and I talk so much that  when he answers a question, it's exactly how I would answer it. Like, he'll he'll be like,  Hey, let's do this. I'll give him an idea for live. He'll give me a title. It's almost exactly  how we do it. So I already know this answer, Aaron, I'm just gonna have you do it because I  know you're gonna get the exact answer. Yeah, so pretty basic answer. Nick talks about it all the  time. It's a great question. The bottom line is Kurt is that it doesn't matter how many lead  generators are in there. It just always comes down to the numbers, right? And so the more lead  generators that are in there, sure, theoretically, the more competitive it will be. But there could  be a hundred lead generators in there. The main things that we're looking at is the search volume,  the CPC, and then also the and then that's mainly for the ad portion. And then the SEO portion  is when we look at the backlinks of the content in the age of the domain, right? Those are the  main and obviously, we have criteria for that it's in the program, you know, but those are the main  things we look at. So it could be zero could be 100. Don't treat them like they're all local  business. Let me this let me do this really quick. I'm going to show you this, Kurt, I'm going to  just give you a quick example. I think I can share my screen. Okay, yes. Beautiful. You guys  can see my screen, right? Yeah. Okay, this is when my whole my whole world changed on this on this  idea is I was looking at this specific city. I love how people are just joining the thing. It's  like, dog, you're you're you're a day late, a dollar short here. Okay. Okay, so I live in St.  George, Utah. And I was like, you know what, this is when I was trying to simplify whatever.  So I searched this, and I started doing my my due diligence. And I saw this website right here.  Okay, I think this is it. No, that's not it. Which one did I see? I think it's down further.  Where is it? This is hilarious. Okay, it's not even here. That's even better. Okay, so this  would be a better example. So I go and do my research. And I see this website, it's like just  the basic tree service st george.com. Or no St. George tree service.com. And I was like,  you Kurt, I was like, gosh dang, I missed it. It's on my own backyard, and all this stuff. And I  went I and I was so ticked about it, because everything looked good. Except for there was  another lead generator. I was like, dang it, somebody already came here. So I went I did like  the who is I found the name of the person on the website, I looked in my group and sure as sure  enough, it was somebody in my group. So I went to my DMs, and I messaged it was a lady. I said,  hey, oh, before that, guys, I called the website. And I was like, I made sure and sure enough,  they didn't have a client. So number one, Kurt, don't assume they have a client.",

Everyone thinks if you get leads,  and you build a website, that's the that's the end all be all that's the beginning.  The actual skill is selling it. So they didn't have a client. So I reached out and I said, hey,  I'm in your group. I live in St. George. I would love to make an offer on your website. And I'd  love to buy it from you. And she gave me like the most snarky, like snubbed response. And  it really just kind of frustrated me and pissed me off. And that's what actually caused me like,  you know, I let's game on. I didn't care if I lose money. I just want to put you out of business  or whatever. I want to put you down of spot. And I went into this space and built this beautiful  little website. I mean, this thing is killing it. Look at this. Look at the picture we chose  for our background. We built this guy right here. And as you can see, I am number one here. I don't  by the way, I don't even have a GMB. And we make 1000 bucks a month have been since 2020. I actually  closed this deal on the hood of a car in a Maverick and a gas station parking lots called Maverick  in 2020 during COVID and made 1000 bucks a month. And that's like from this no GMB. And I  almost didn't go into the city. Okay, so and look, here's the irony. This the company, the website  that I almost scared me off, nowhere to be found. They gave up. Okay, so if you look at it, and it's  the metrics all make sense. Don't be afraid to go into it even if you see another lead generator.  Okay, any other questions there? Yeah, we got a few. So well, yeah, Muneeb says, I mean, we can't  listen. I'll let you respond to this. Can you list a couple of metrics to identify the perfect  city niche combo? I think I might be overthinking it and crossing out some good ones. Yeah.  Yeah, that's, that's a that's a that's not a loaded question. It's just a bit of a complex  question with the time we have. I'm trying to think if made, I would direct you Muneeb,  Nick had done a YouTube show last year in 2023 titled making hay with Dre. And you kind of had  a live dedicated to each of the seven steps in the process. And so I'd look for those first couple.  Yeah, that's a good place to start for sure. Obviously, those are that's like, that's like  the secret. So that's like, that's what we teach, right? But if you want some ideas, and for time  sake, go and look at the go to the YouTube channel, then go to lives and search it under  there. Good call. Keep going. Yeah, for sure. Jaleel says, Where are you? Where are you in your  agency? Where you are in your agency is motivation. Thanks for the advice. Where should someone be  before they strictly focus on consulting? Consulting as in selling a program?  I'm not exactly sure. Maybe it's time about legit consulting. Well, I'll say this. I don't know.  Like consulting and like the the actual sense of like paying me for my advice. I don't do that.  Like I've I will not I've never actually had anyone pay me where I've gotten on a call and  gotten paid. So",

    "pageContent": "I just don't believe in trading my time for dollars. So the other option is to  you know, package your information and sell it, which is what I'm doing right now, which is why  I have digital landlords. Here's what I'll tell you. I didn't. Sorry, super quick, Jaleel, just  clarified consulting with the person you have running the agency. So it sounds like outsourcing  to a project manager. Okay, I was about to say if you're talking about doing a program, I made  a million dollars two years in a row, and then I started talking about it. So that'd be a good  spot to like start a program, which by the way, I got no beef with because if you have something  that's different than what I'm offering, go do it. But just make sure you got the pot to piss in.  Or I might wreck your life. I'm just kidding. So for me, I mean, as soon as possible, you want  to remove yourself from the business as soon as possible. I was I couldn't let sales go. I was so  I loved it so much. And it was a high for me that like I just love getting that deal. And honestly,  I was finally able to let go of it when I started digital landlords and I would sell I would bring  people into the program and I was like, Oh, I still get my fix, right. And then eventually,  like I don't even do our sales for that anymore. But the truth is, as soon as possible, I would  make sure you go through and do at least five websites end to end every single piece of the  puzzle before you start outsourcing and then slowly start outsourcing all the pieces that make that  move the needle the least the content, sorry, the things that caught take the most amount of time  that move the needle the least building the website, you know, setting up the on page SEO,  whatever the stuff that's very, very, like just a formula, and then moving all the way up to sales  and sales was is the thing I would get rid of last but you do it as soon as possible, obviously,  then you can go and you can focus on more strategic stuff, you can focus on bigger deals,  like right now, the only time I get involved in a deal is if it's a big deal. And so like,  for example, we did a proposal for 7500 or 10,000 per month was our options, we gave them,  and I got a little bit involved in that deal, because it's like, okay, that's 100 plus $1,000  per year, per year, that actually is gonna, you know, make a little bit of a dent.  Yeah, for sure. I mean, yeah, I mean, I suppose most of us have read Rich Dad Poor Dad and  Kiyosaki talks about until the business can run without you, you still just have a job, right.  And so the goal should be how can the business run without that's at least  my long term trajectory. So Shane says, thanks, guys, as always have to hop have an awesome week.  Thanks, Shane. It's always great to have you. And then last question, Julian says,  what's the best sales book you would advise me to read for R&R and why?  Best sales book I would read would be The Psychology of Selling by Tracy.  Very simple, very basic, but I've read that book, I don't know, three, four times. That's a really  solid book. Don't try to listen to it on audio. You will fall asleep, because the guy has like one  of those like very soothing voices, and it's just like whatever, but",

This is the thing I was  talking about earlier. It's called Rank and Rent Engine, but make sure to hit me up first,  because we're doing a beta before you just go and start paying for it.

We are going to, we want to make sure these calls are very, like, we make, these are smaller  sessions, they're more intimate sessions.  We do that on purpose.  We want to deliver like a more intimate experience and only let certain people on these calls  that are serious.  And so welcome to the call.  We wouldn't have like sent you the link if we didn't think you were serious.  And obviously you had to jump through a couple of hoops to get here.  So one of the things that we are going to require though, is if you want to stay on  the call, you need to get your camera on.  The reason why we do that is because we want the people that are on this call to be paying  attention.  So put your camera on, we'll give you a few minutes in case you're laying in bed, which  by the way, if you're in bed and you want to keep staying in bed, we don't mind, but  if it's up to you.  So in order to stand this call in the next five minutes, get your camera on.  The reason being is we want people paying attention.  And if we just wanted a bunch of numbers, we would just put the link in the Facebook  group.  But we want to see your faces, we want to be able to interact, et cetera.  So that said, Aaron, you know what to do, we've got five minutes.  At the end of this call, those people that are still on the call, we're going to screenshot  and we will be putting together a, this one, because it's an interview, it's not necessarily  like a presentation or a training.  We are, we're probably going to just send out the replay.  So we'll probably be sending the replay itself to everybody that's on this call at the end  and we'll stick a screenshot and we'll get you that replay.  So but just as a heads up.  Okay.  I just want to pull up my notes really quick.  Did I miss anything, Aaron?  Sounds good to go.  Okay.  That's beautiful.  I just want to make sure I didn't forget anything.  Pull up my notes.  So yeah, guys, we'll give you a couple of minutes.  Get your cameras on.  You can keep it on mute.  We don't care.  We don't care if you're in bed.  We don't care if you're mowing the lawn.  We just want to see your faces.  We want to see what we're talking to.  And yeah, let's go from there.  I did see one comment popping up said that they spied the Alabama hat.  Yes.  And by the way, if it's like, that's why my voice is gone.  I went to the game on Saturday and it got crazy.  So I lost my voice.  So I apologize for that, but I'm not sick.  I feel great.  I just lost my voice at the game.  That's when you know the game is good, by the way.  Okay.  So guys, today, welcome to the call.  We've got Mike V on this call.  And before we get into the interview, I want to just let you guys know that I don't I  I never want to say that you should believe me.  I never want to say that you should just take my my word for anything.  And I want I want that to be the same case for anybody in the free group.  OK, I see a lot of people at this really irritates",

    "pageContent": "me, by the way.  Aaron knows this. Jason knows this.  I'm sure Mike senses this.  But when I see people in the group offering advice,  it drives me nuts because 99 percent of the time, those people aren't even making money.  Right. And I see people just raising their hand, saying,  yeah, send me your free landing page or send me your free script or whatever.  And guys, we don't take a second to think,  does this person even know what they're talking about?  And this is such an overused example, but I'm going to use it.  That's like literally having somebody randomly in the group.  Let's say we're in a fitness group and somebody randomly offers to say,  it says, hey, I want to give you guys my workout plan and my diet,  my workout routine and my diet plan.  Who wants it? Right. And everyone raising their hand.  And no one was saying, hey, let's see a picture and see if you're actually in shape.  Right. That's how crazy it is.  And so I this Aaron, am I wrong or is this the first interview that we've done on these calls  since we changed the format?  First one. First one.  I don't let people like in all the history of our group.  I think that we like unless I've I know for a fact that they've made money,  I don't think that we've ever let anyone on a call.  And I'm 100% sure of that.  Unless they've made money doing this, we've never let them on a call.  And we've never let somebody back twice unless they're making like real money.  So that said, guys, I think you guys know my story.  2016, I started and I'm saying this for the one or two people maybe that don't know.  Eight years ago, I started doing this business model.  Knew nothing about the Internet, knew nothing about online, was making my money,  doing door to door sales, and basically was just looking for a way to make money,  travel, be able to travel, be able to provide for my family, be able to have experiences  and start buying real estate, all these different things.  And I was looking for a model that had certain elements, passive.  It was it was passive in nature.  It was recurring. It was asset based.  It was Internet based.  It was scalable, da da da da da.  And this is the one that I landed on.  And I still, after all these years, have not found one that beats this or even comes close to this.  So in 2020, we did our first seven figures.  2021, we did another seven figures.  And then in 2021, December 1st, we officially launched Digital Landlords,  which is when we started training people how to do this.  Mike V being one of the people that came through our program, as well as Aaron, as well as Jason.  And that is the story.  So just to give you guys a little bit of context so that for those of you that don't know who I am or know much of the story,  I wouldn't be sitting here talking to you and I wouldn't feel right about talking to you if I hadn't made millions of dollars doing this.  OK, so the reason I brought Mike V on and I'm going to have him share his story a bit is Mike V is doing $40,000 per month  doing this business model.  And, Mike, that's US or that's New Zealand dollars?  That's big boy dollars.  Thank you. I love that.  Big boy",

Obviously, it's not all profit, but just just to give you an idea of what's possible, that's what's possible.  So I'm going to today we're going to be interviewing Mike and I want you guys to like we're going to save a good amount of time for Q&A.  This is somebody who is like a grassroots born like made from from the ground up.  He started doing this not that long ago, and he's at $40,000 per month.  And and he's also living a very interesting and really quite inspiring life with what he's doing.  So I'm excited to get into it.  So, Mike V, welcome to the call, brother.  Just having me on again.  Good to catch up.  I appreciate it, man.  I've hit him up a few times recently because he's he's it's such a cool story that I wanted to share it.  So we did have an interview a few weeks ago in digital landlords.  It was it was really popular with tons of people on the call.  A lot of people want to hear what you have to say.  So I'm excited. So today I want to go like, you know, Mike, we've talked before and we've shared like some of the higher level stuff.  I really want to go to like I think I'm looking at the audience here, some of these names.  There are one or two people that are in the in the digital landlords group, which welcome guys.  I see like Hill, he's he just barely joined.  But a lot of these folks are still just kind of like looking at the model, poking around, et cetera.  So we're going to talk about like more of the basics and why you decide to get into the model and some tips and that kind of stuff.  But before that, I want you to just share your just kind of like your two to five minute story of, you know,  where you started and how you got to where you're at right now, because I know there's a lot of people on here that don't know your story.  So let's start with that, man. And tell people where you're at, by the way, right now and where you're from as well.  Yes, we are. So I'm originally from Auckland, New Zealand, currently based in Thailand, just south of Bangkok.  But I mean, to keep it fairly short, about seven years ago, I went to Bali just on like a break after I finished uni.  And I was like, this is so cool here. Like, you know, why can't I just stay in Bali?  Like, why do I have to go home and get a job and go back to the kind of into the system and all that?  And since that moment, I was just trying to figure out how I could make enough money to go back.  So I got back and I basically did corporate marketing, like sitting at a desk, working a nine to five for about five years.  And I was trying to figure out all the side hustle stuff after work and in the weekends.  And I was making about a thousand bucks a month for like four years, which looking back is like this crazy to think about.  But and yeah, I was doing a bit of local regeneration, like some builders and stuff.  And I was like, hey, I'm pretty good at this stuff. You know, I just need to get more clients.  And it just never really happened. I didn't really know how to get more clients.  And",

    "pageContent": "that's when I came across what you're doing with the rank and rent.  I was like, this is so cool. I can just do the same thing, like get leads for these builder type companies.  But I own all of the all of the properties. And, you know, it's me.  You don't have to catch up with the monthly meetings like you just.  You just as long as you're getting them the leads, you're providing the value and you can just get paid and it just gives you so much freedom.  Like, as long as the client's phones are ringing, then mine are not.  So I was pretty sold on what Nick was up to, consumed all of the free YouTube videos and then eventually joined.  And when I joined on, I was on about thousand dollars a month and I actually had a ticket booked to go to Thailand in four months.  I was like, you know, I'm just going to book this ticket and make it happen, like whatever happens happens.  And, you know, thankfully, I joined this program and found out about digital landlords.  And within eight weeks, I was on eight thousand a month.  So it took me four years to four years making a thousand bucks a month.  And then within eight weeks of joining Nick's program, I was on eight thousand.  Just couldn't believe it, really. And since then, I had the best years of my life, personal growth, travel,  you know, and then obviously scaled up to forty thousand a month as well while still traveling.  And I've only got one contractor. So, yeah, that's the that's the story.  So you only have I'm going to jump in that last part.  So you only when you say you only have one contractor, what do you mean by that?  I just got one guy who does on my blog post for the SEO sites.  You're you're at forty thousand a month, you and one person.  Yeah, the contractor. Yeah, that's crazy, brother.  That is absolutely insane. OK, so I want to I want to go.  And I had a few questions as you were throughout the story.  And some of these are a little bit just curiosity because I've I've heard your story  and I want to dig in a little bit. And some of them are more on the tactical side.  So why what was it? I think this happens to a lot of us.  Like we we have an experience, maybe it's a trip, maybe it's a interaction, a conversation.  What about Bali was so I'm just curious,  what about it was so attractive to you when you went?  I think it was the main thing was the freedom, like.  I just remember having my scooter being actually in Lombok,  which is a much more quiet island.  Bali's very busy now, but I remember that moment of just like pure peace and like freedom  and just not knowing that I had to wake up to an alarm tomorrow or like answer to anyone.  And since that moment, I've just.  That's just been my mission to to have that freedom whenever I want.  And it's yeah, it's so so so grateful to have that like today.  I honestly felt really tired from traveling the last couple of weeks.  And I just did nothing, you know, just some just some basic stuff and try again tomorrow.  But if I was at a nine to five, I'd have to get up and like grind and go through hell and back.  It's it's crazy, because every single person on this call,  every single one of us, including me, if I if I so wished is like we could do whatever,  like we could change our entire situation.  Right.

    "pageContent": "I think that we we hear stories like Mike's, your stories like mine.  And they're like, they make you feel good.  They inspire you. But we just think it's not for us.  You know, like, man, it would be so cool if we could move to Bali.  And just set up shop and ride scooters all day and make forty thousand a month.  It sounds fake. It sounds like, oh, that's that's what you read about in the four hour  work week kind of thing. But truly, truly like.  Any one of us could do it, man.  So my question for you is, if you guys didn't catch this part of his story,  Mike went to Bali, he went back like in Bali, he's like, I'm coming back.  You went back and at some point you said, I'm just going to book a ticket.  And I'm basically forcing myself to go back to Bali.  I'm basically forcing myself to make it happen by this date.  Right. So how did you have the confidence to know that you could pull it off?  Because you you hadn't done you've done a little bit of like stuff on your own,  but you hadn't made the kind of money you needed to make.  What gave you the confidence to do that?  I don't really have any confidence that I was shutting myself leading up to leaving.  So when I booked the ticket, I was making a thousand dollars a month.  And that was probably enough to just have like three small meals  staying like a really shitty backpackers, you know, that was probably enough to  have freedom, no luxury or anything.  But I didn't really have any confidence doing it.  I was just turning 30 and I was reading a lot of like stoicism  about like Memento Mori and, you know, the shortness of life and everything.  And I was like, hey, I just I just have to do this.  What were you reading? Meditations?  Is that like the main one you're reading or some other ones as well?  Yeah, I was reading meditations.  I also read a Seneca book on the shortness of life.  That's a really good book.  Definitely recommend that one. That's a bit more about  Seneca, just like observing a lot of the people in Rome at the time  and how they were like squandering their time, he said.  He says so that that that definitely helped me.  I had some urgency to just to book the ticket.  Seneca, the shortness of life on the shortness of life.  Interesting. I just I typed it in, I want to look it up.  So and basically in that book, it was talking about how the Romans  were just squandering their life and he was observing this and going,  what am I doing? And that's I mean, what's the premise of that?  It was just observing like all the royals and the people that.  You know, lots of lots of money, but they were  always kind of like waiting for the future,  like living in the future, not in the moment and living in expectancy  and talking about when they do reach like the older years,  that all of a sudden they just have this not regret, but like,  sure, I need I need to go do all this stuff.  So when you're reading that, you kind of just internalize it.  And even at 30, I still feel quite old,  especially with some of the guys that I meet in Thailand  at a lot younger who made the jump earlier.  So I just wish that I did it sooner.  Yeah, I hold you 30, 30,",

I've never I feel like I feel like when I looked at people that were 30,  I feel way younger than how I viewed people that were 30.  So so I know exactly what you're saying, man. So  for those people that are  let's just I don't know exactly, but maybe there is.  Maybe there will be some replays that we send out to some people  that are like, quote unquote, older that aren't in their 20s.  Do you think that anybody can do this?  And I don't need you to give me a real  an answer that you think I'm looking for, but do you think it's possible  that anybody can start this business and make money?  Or do you think that there are certain people that cannot?  And again, this is just pure based on what you think.  I think you know, I can tell you that I'm not going to be able to do this.  What you think?  I think anyone can follow the training and  you know, a monkey, a monkey could follow the training,  like, to be honest, the way you've laid everything out in the course is  it is extremely simple, like looking back, it's  it's just so simple.  I don't think everybody has the like the desire  or the mindset to  to go through the tough parts, especially when you're trying  to get your first deal.  Yeah.  You know, my opinion on it, sorry, I was going to give  I'm going to give Aaron cohost really quick  because he so he can control the  volume and stuff. Aaron, did you get the cohost  real quick? Yes. OK, beautiful.  My opinion is that anyone can do it,  but  the people like there are certain people that like have a  proclivity that are going to do better because they're more,  you know, they have more risk tolerance  or they have, you know, more  hunger or whatever. So, yeah, I'm with you, man.  I think anybody on this call, if you guys will  follow the training or the recipe  that's been laid out, which is like do this, do this, do this.  Anybody could do it. And it's funny  because I was having this conversation just yesterday on my flight  home with my dad.  He was asking me this. He's like, so, you know,  there's a specific person that he knew had just  joined my program and he knows this person. He's like, so how  do you think he's going to do? And I said, well, I  said he can do as good as he wants to. I like he's  like, so you think he can actually make good money? And I said, yeah,  I said I gave him some examples  and I'm going to give you guys the same examples. Guys, we have people  that have speech impediments that  are making fifteen, twenty thousand a month. We have people that have  health problems. We have people with accents, which and I'm  giving you guys examples of things that people think are  impediments to their  success or that are supposed to keep them from their success.  We have people that are in other  countries. We have people that  I'm trying to give you single moms, single dads,  people in college that are young, people that are  in their later",

So, yes, I truly believe anybody can do it, but  it just comes down to the freaking like the will  to do it. And that's it. And so, Mike,  you're at forty thousand a month. There's people  that have been in the free group.  Some of them, I could see their names, still don't have a  deal. Heck, there's some  like, let's be honest, there are people that have even  gotten to the Digital Landlords program.  They got in and decided not to do anything with it that aren't making  money because they're not taking action. What's the  difference between you and people that are not making any money? Like,  how are you at forty K? Why are they not?  Are you more talented? Are you more special?  I mean, I started, I started off my career  walking in the mud, doing landscaping and excavations.  I think the formula  or the system, because I think there's  a formula and system for everything, is just having  the desire and the mindset. So I think that's  what I really had, if I look back,  was the mindset  and sorry, the desire. And I definitely got the mindset from  the book recommendations that you made in the  landlords. You know, once you sign up for the program,  you're committed, right? You're committed financially  and it's a lot easier to take action when you've made a  commitment. So I read the Think and Grow Rich book  back to front, you know, the first week standing  in the mirror there, reciting, you know,  how much you're going to make.  Yeah, so the desire mindset and  there's one last part I think I forgot.  I think everything kind of happens from that.  I was very focused, like, oh, sorry, yeah,  it was taking a risk, like a committed risk.  Like, if I joined landlords and didn't have that ticket book,  then things may have looked a little bit different.  But, you know, if you've got a family or something and you're not,  you kind of like book a flight or something, then  I think it's just equally important to have that desire, whether that's taking your  your kids to school. Like I look at Ryan Dalton and  digital landlords, you know, he's someone I really look up to.  You know, he's into like martial arts,  stuff like that, digital, grand congruent, but he's also got  kids and like a family. So, you know, to see the  to see what he can provide his kids, whether it's like personal training for  jujitsu or education, you know, I'm sure that's  one of his desires to have a nice family home with a dog.  Just getting locked in on that desire and then  following the book recommendation and landlords would be my  recommendation.  OK, why did you choose?  So you said that you were doing some lead generation before  you started doing rank and rent specifically, right?  What kind of lead generation were you doing?  I was building WordPress websites  for local builders and running some ads  and some SEO.  And were you doing that on someone's recommendation  or did you just stumble into it?  I was at my nine to five corporate  stuff learning a bit about marketing and then  I was trying to do free stuff. I remember  I did a couple of free websites back in the day, one for a  a lash extension company, one for a  homegrown honey one.  And then I",

    "pageContent": "think two years later when I was still making basically  nothing, I met a guy at a party who had a building company  and he's like, hey, I just want to grow my  building company. So I just did some free stuff for him  and got some good results. So for the next  two years, I think I've got one or two more clients like  in terms of like a long term client.  They didn't really grow, but I was kind of decent at  getting the leads. I just didn't have  the system or the vehicle to land more clients  and get clients. And obviously cold calling is a big part of the  digital landlords, the pre-selling.  Why did you choose  like instead of doing  one of the other models, why  why didn't you choose to do  you know, copywriting or  an SEO agency or  drop shipping, whatever, insert  whatever business model. What made you decide  and I'm asking this because maybe there's  somebody on this call that's like, you know,  number one, in order for you guys to make money at this, you have  to number one, there's a couple different things you have to believe.  Number one is you have to have  made up your mind that you have to do  something, right? Meaning you have to start something  on the side or you have to replace what you're currently doing.  So sometimes I'll get on calls with people.  This is back when I used to be the person that would sell people  into digital landlords. They'd get on a call with me and the first question  I would ask them is, are you  like, do you really believe, do you have the desire to do  something, period? Or are you still deciding  whether you should do something or not? And what I mean by that  is like once in a while I'll get somebody on the call and they'd be  like, yeah, I'm trying to decide if I should  start doing, if I should do something, right? And so guys,  if you're not sold, if you don't realize  that you need to do something, that's step one, right?  And I hope that the fact that you're on this call  is enough that like you know you need to do something.  I'm assuming if you're on this call on a Monday morning, if you're  in the U.S. or maybe a Monday evening if you're not  in Asia, that you know you need to do  something. That's step one. Step two is you need to realize  or you need to pick what do I need to do, right?  And there's a lot of things you could do. You could do drop shipping.  You could do copywriting. You could do SEO. You could build websites.  You could do social media  management. You could do  what other business models? A TikTok  shop. What else  am I missing? What's that?  Coaching, remote sales, affiliate marketing.  Right. These are all online things.  Affiliate marketing, blogging. There's a  thousand different things. And so the next step you guys need to  decide is what am I going to use? And you  used a really important word. You said you didn't know like  the vehicle. So for  you, what was the reason that this vehicle,  what was the number one thing? I know that like there's so many  things for me that make this vehicle  and just to make it simple, we'll call it  website rental or building and renting  simple websites. Why was it that this  model was so attractive? What was the number one most attractive  part of this specific model?  I was watching one of your YouTube videos ",

You know, all the other guys that I've done a bit of like  SEO and Google Ads for, I'm building up their business,  building up their stuff. And if they cancel, like it's over.  You know, you'll rank a guy number one in SEO and it's like, hey man,  I'm going to cancel because I've got so many leads coming through.  Whereas this  and also the dynamic, it's not the usual agency client  dynamic where you're getting on monthly calls  like supplicating and telling them what you've got planned  for the next month. It's like, here's your leads,  you know, pay me my retainer. I'm going to make sure you're good  and you just leave me alone because I can go back to  jumping on the scooter and doing what I want.  I love the thought of Mike V  on a scooter around  Thailand. It's just, it's a good thought. I like that,  dude. I like that a lot. There's actually a Duke, we're on a Ducati  1100 CC a couple of weeks back.  But originally we started on the 50 CC scooter in Bali  and we've upgraded to the Ducati.  Dude, that's rad, man. I love  everything about that. And I need to come out, I would love to come out and  check out the place. I've never been to Thailand, by the way.  I'm going to come. Oh, no way. Never, never.  But I want to. It's been on the list for a while, so I'll make it happen.  Here's what I want  to ask really quick is, Aaron, are you still on the call?  Yes. Aaron, I'm going to put you on the spot.  What was your favorite thing about RankinRent?  And Aaron has a really, we had an interview  Aaron one of these days because he's one of the most persistent people  I've ever met and I love him for that.  What was the biggest thing for you?  You're a very, you study a lot.  You are pretty logical.  What was the reason that you decided that RankinRent was the vehicle?  Just for everyone here, because everyone has their own reasons.  What was the number one thing for you?  Yeah, I mean, a couple years ago when I first discovered it, I had  boxes in my mind that had to check in order for me to be able to  do something to make money. And this was the model  that checked most boxes.  Was there a specific box that stood out?  There was a myriad of like equally important  like one, I had to do it from home because I couldn't drive.  I needed it to be where there was low.  Aaron was 16 when he discovered this.  So he's like, I got to do something I can do at my, you know.  Yeah, and it had to be like low financial barrier to entry.  And it had to be do something that I could learn the skill.  And those were the three big ones.  And then there's a couple other ones I'm trying to remember.  But yeah, like that looks like a bunch and it had to work.  Like, come on, we've all looked at drop shipping  and affiliate marketing. And it's like, yeah.  Anyway, so those were the boxes in it.  Dude, I remember watching your YouTube video.  To be fair, I saw one guy first talk about it.  And then in the trending now",

But it had Nick Wood video with like super dark background  could barely see your face with like six views.  And I clicked on it and that's when it made sense.  So, yeah, for sure.  Here we are. Here we are.  And OK, thanks for jumping in, Aaron.  Guys, the reason I wanted to ask is everyone has their reasoning.  And I know when you're not in the model, like for me and Mike and Aaron,  Jason, I think he might have to hop off because he's he's literally jumping on a call,  which is awesome.  I mean, just to show you like we're practicing what we preach  when you're not in it, it seems so it's it's a tantalizing idea,  but it still kind of seems like like there's that little bit of you that still doubts.  Are these people actually making money?  Mike V, did you ever have that doubt?  Like, dude, this guy's full of crap.  Maybe this doesn't really work.  Or did you just blindly believe?  Your answer is fine. I'm just curious.  No, I mean, it makes sense.  You know, local businesses need leads, you know,  and people use Google to find local businesses.  So I didn't think it was farfetched at all.  I think it's one of the, you know, more classic business models  where you're just getting a local business, local business, more business and taking a cut.  And I agree 100 percent.  It was kind of the same like I kind of I don't want to say I blindly followed.  But for me, all that it took was understanding conceptually what was going on.  But when I joined my first program back in 2016,  I didn't ask the guy that sold me the program to show me a stripe account.  I probably should have.  I didn't ask who some, you know, I didn't see case studies like, you know,  I think we have like 150, 200 plus case studies of people from all walks of life that are making money.  I didn't see that kind of stuff. I was like, oh, that makes sense.  How much is your program? Oh, eight thousand dollars.  Boom. Let's go. You know, that kind of a thing.  And I think that could get you in trouble.  But I think for people like me and Mike, we kind of like my mentality is I'm going to figure it out.  You know, as long as you can show me the map, I'm going to figure it out.  And I heard her Mosi talk about this like he's like all the programs I've ever joined.  He's like, I joined it as a student and then I quickly became the top person in that group.  And then after I became the top person, I had people reaching out and then I did my own thing.  And he's like, that's kind of the trend. And that's exactly what happened with me.  That's exactly what happened with Mike. I joined my first group.  I didn't really I was like, dude, I didn't see anyone making really good money.  So I'm going to figure out how to make really good money.  Got to one hundred thousand dollars a month, started talking about it, started my own and Mike, he joined.  He's, you know, in Bali riding around his scooter and and figured this out.  And he's doing he's at forty thousand bucks",

But I just want to let you guys know that if you're sitting there going, I don't know if this is actually as good as it sounds or if people are actually making money.  That's totally normal. And it's completely fine to have those doubts.  But I guess you should just like intuitively look at it and go.  All right. Either either I have Mike completely lying through his teeth.  I have Aaron lying through his teeth. I have Jason lying through his teeth.  I have my brother Porter lying through his teeth, you know, or this actually does work.  Or and I'm also lying repeatedly on my videos, which very well could be the case.  And I could very well be capable of that for all you know.  But it sounds like a lot of work to continually.  I'd still watch them for the comedy aspect if it was BS.  Speaking of bad videos. Yeah.  Guys, Aaron, Aaron said he made a good point when I started digital landlords.  I started it December 1st, 2021.  And in March of 2022, I was on a trip to Mexico with my family.  And I realized like I should probably start doing some of this branding stuff.  I should probably start sharing some of this on YouTube.  And if you don't have a YouTube channel or you've never done it, it's pretty intimidating to like make that commitment.  Because you are no matter how confident you are, you're just all you're thinking about is, oh, my gosh, people that I know are going to see this.  And who am I? And they're going to think that I think I'm this or that or the rest.  And I remember I'm like, I just have to do it.  And I made like a couple of videos and I was super stressed out.  I went up into my into my room. My kids are at the pool.  And I I told my wife, I'm like, hey, I'm going to go up.  I'm going to make some videos. And I was so uncomfortable.  And I'm like, who am I to talk about this business model?  Meanwhile, I'd made millions of dollars doing this.  But the point is what I'm going to bring up is that I just did it.  I just started right. The videos Aaron's talking about.  I think Aaron was at the video. I was sitting at this desk with no lighting and no it was no intro.  It was the title was like seven hundred characters long.  And it was like just really weird topics kind of stuff.  Those kind of videos, dude, for sure, like super nice components of the business model.  It was like why you should stop waiting for your website to rank before you sell a flat fee deal.  Like no one would know what you're talking about unless you knew what ranking rent was.  But I just I want to make this point like, guys, you're not going to have all the answers.  You're not going to you're not going to be able to just like know 100 percent.  There's always going to be an element of uncertainty.  And if you're someone that's sitting there waiting for things to be 100 percent certain, it's not going to happen.  Now I want to talk about this really quick and then we're going to get the Q&A.  Timing is never going to be",

    "pageContent": "perfect, guys.  It's not. By the way, speaking of that, did we did we release that episode on why you should start now from on our podcast?  Yes. Aaron, we go get the link and I want you to share that in the chat, guys.  I just did a podcast episode on Thursday and it's called Why You Should Start Now.  Talking about this quote that my dad always told me, make hay while the sun shines.  There is never going to be a perfect time. It's never going to be the perfect conditions.  Mike, when you started this, was it the ideal time for you to jump in and start doing this full time?  Was it the ideal time? I already know the answer is no.  How did you still I'm just going to answer. No, it wasn't.  How did you still get yourself to take action even though it wasn't a perfect time?  No, it was terrible timing. I was about to drop a third of my net worth, which wasn't a lot at the time.  And I was quitting my safety net job in 10 weeks.  It's probably the worst time possible, but actually it was the best time possible because I had to make it work.  I love that. It was the worst time, but might have been the best time.  Guys, I'm telling you right now in this podcast episode that we're going to put in the comments.  I talk about this. I don't care what it is in life.  I don't care if it's when you're going to get married, when you're going to have kids, when you're going to start the business,  when you're going to have that tough conversation, when you're going to go do that volunteer trip,  when you're going to ask that girl out or the guy out.  It does not matter. I promise you the timing is never going to be perfect.  It's never going to be a good time.  And you can either be one of two types of people.  You can be the person that's always going to wait for the time to be perfect.  Oh, I'm going to wait until I look at this thing or I check that or oh, we're going on this trip.  We're going to wait till the trip's over or once this thing happens or oh, it's October.  And we have Halloween coming up and then we have Thanksgiving.  And then let's just start at the first year.  You know, you know the type of person that's always starting the diet, but it's on Monday, right?  I'm going to start on Monday, right?  We all know that type of person. We've all been that type of person.  The timing is never going to be perfect, just so you know, I promise you.  And you can either be that person that's waiting or you can be the type that's like me and Mike.  And I would I dare say Aaron as well.  And I dare say Jason, even though I don't think he's on the call anymore.  The type of person that I am is that when I feel like doing something, I just do it.  And guys, sometimes that is terrible timing.  Mike, have you ever done 75 hard?  No, I never really did that because I've always been pretty disciplined anyway.  Yeah, I didn't really do anything for you. And I totally get that.  I've only done it once. I'm not a big Andy Frisella guy.  I'm not a big like, you know, I actually think a lot of that stuff has value.  I think the cold plunges are probably good for you.  I just don't love when people post about it, that",

    "pageContent": "kind of stuff.  But anyway, there's this thing called 75 hard.  And I heard about it. And guys, I just like I just felt like I needed to do it.  And I just started it. And I it was like in the winter, it was cold.  I had a cruise coming up, a trip coming up.  All these different things. And I just felt like I needed to do it because if I didn't do it, then I would never do it.  And I remember being on my cruise and doing my second workout of the day up at the top of the cruise ship at 12 a.m.  And not being able to eat the desserts, all these different things and being like, Nick, you're such an idiot.  Why don't you just end? But then at the same time, realizing like that's why I am where I am because I just take action when I feel like it.  And so I guess my point is, is I want you guys to understand whoever's on this call that's waiting for the perfect time.  There's never going to be a perfect time. There's just not. That's just that's just how it is.  So for sure. You got to jump in the trenches with anything.  You know, there's definitely an element of trenches like I've grinded super hard leading up to leaving Thailand.  You know, I was working five days a week at nine to five. I was working on this two hours a day after work.  I was going to the gym six days a week. You know, I take some days off and there's definitely a lot of time in the trenches.  But what really carried me through was the fact that I already committed to the program and I was reading the Think and Grow Rich books.  So the subconscious mind was programmed like to get through.  And when the moments do get tough, which they will, you still knew what that that dream outcome was and the consequences of not achieving it.  Yeah. Yep. Same, man.  When I started, I had my second child on the way. I just bought a house. I just bought another car.  I was in the middle of the job that provided my entire yearly income for the whole year in five months,  meaning if I messed it up or I distracted myself too much, I was risking my money.  It's paying the bills. I was door knocking. I had no energy.  I had no time, but I just went for it and I figured it out.  And so those of you that are like, I don't have time. You do. You do.  I promise. Especially you that don't have kids or that don't have other stuff like I had kids.  I had a full time door knocking job. I had a wife. I was all these different responses.  I was managing a team of guys that were also knocking with me.  So anyway, I just want to talk about timing is never going to be perfect.  Don't wait for it to be perfect. If you're that type of person, it's it's it's just going to be tough, man.  You're going to sit there and wait forever. And we all know that type of person.  They're sitting there. Oh, I don't want to start the campaign because I have, you know, I've got that double that I've got that shift with those extra hours.  And what if a lead comes in while I'm at work? It's like, dude, you step out or you miss the call.  You go in the bathroom and call it like you just figure it out.  You would like if you guys are those type of people, it's going to be very, very difficult for you.  So anyway, I've",

    "pageContent": "talked enough. I want to I do want to ask one more thing.  And then any questions you guys have, we've got about 10 minutes.  I'm going to let you guys ask questions in the comments.  I'm going to have Aaron kind of filled those questions. You can ask Mike anything.  But Mike, tell me about you said you're a pretty disciplined person.  What does that mean? Are you disciplined with what you eat?  Is it your schedule? Is it your routine? Is it your like your thoughts?  When you say you're a pretty disciplined person, what do you mean?  I guess when I've got a goal or something that I want to achieve, then, you know, I'll be pretty consistent with just the daily actions.  For example, at the start of the year, I was on about 10k a month in December and I was like, I want to get to 40k a month.  And I just asked myself, what is what does a 40k a month version of me do?  And then just had the discipline to embody that.  And then here we are now doing it.  I was really always been in fitness and stuff.  So I think that that comes with like not really drinking and going to the gym and just and eating well healthy.  I think like right now I'm super tired and jet lag and flu and I haven't been able to like make money or work hard.  So I think health help is a really important aspect of being successful, you know, launching a business as well.  Do you think that people that are not disciplined can learn to be disciplined?  Yeah, I think it's I remember watching a video back when I was driving to the corporate job doing digital landlords.  And it's that classic motivation video where he's like, you know, when you want to when you want to be successful as much as you want to breathe.  Then you'll be successful.  And off the back of that, you have to have the discipline like you say, which is like so ingrained in my head, which I'm very grateful for is you have to do what needs to be done when it needs to be done, regardless of how you feel.  And that's why I think your program and you as a person has been so awesome to be a part of this because of like your mindset and and just like the aggression that you have with with getting stuff done.  Because you need to just you need to be disciplined with decisions you make and join up, you know, getting home from work.  You don't want to do life transfers, but you've got to call them up.  All that kind of stuff.  It's easy on Sunday afternoon or Saturday afternoon when you're thinking about you kind of daydreaming about doing this job and living in Bali or living in Thailand and thinking about all this stuff.  It's really easy.  But then about Wednesday, you've had a couple bad nights of sleep.  You've got your butt kicked by some of these business owners, you know, and I mean your butt kick like you've got yelled at you.  You know, you're not feeling 100% gym.  You're sore because of the gym, all this different stuff.  And then by about Wednesday, it's really easy to start slipping.  But it's so true, man.  Once you figure out what it takes, like let's take anyone on this call.  Let's say someone on this calls at zero dollars right now in this business and they want to get to 10k a month.  There is an exact map of how you're going to get there, right?  There is a certain number of people you need to call in order to get a certain amount of life transfers or opportunities to",

And once you map that out, which we do train you how to do inside of digital landlords.  Once you map that out, guys, all you have to do is just do the things that you have to do.  And that's it. And you have to do them when they need to be done.  And the hard part is when you don't feel like it like Mike V. Right.  He's not feeling great today. He's jet lagged.  He's sick, but he's on this call.  Like today, it's Monday. It's I woke up at 630. I've been traveling all weekend.  I didn't get much sleep. I was on two red eyes.  It's my daughter's birthday. I've got every excuse in the world to be like, yeah, let's just skip this week.  You know what I mean? But you just got to get in the habit of, hey, I on Mondays for me, I do this call and I don't care if I'm sick.  I don't care if I didn't sleep last night. I just do this call.  And Mike's done the same thing. You know, he has to do certain things.  He has to call business owners at certain times and he has to do certain things.  And that's why he's at 40k.  And so it's not rocket science. It's not rocket science.  Just doing what needs to be done when it needs to be done.  And sometimes you don't feel like doing it. You gotta do it anyway.  So great. Great point, bro.  Aaron Vogler, do we have any comments, any questions, anything in the chat yet?  Yes, Matt Torres says great to see Mike is successful.  Absolutely. Like Mike, it was so cool when I first heard that you hit 40k because I remember watching your interview.  I joined a few months, I think, after you had had that interview and I was just binge watching all this stuff.  And I distinctly remembered yours because you kept harping on thinking Grow Rich.  And I like that book a lot, too. And it was so cool to hear like less than two years later or two years later, whatever, that you'd like kept it going.  And you were a pretty quiet guy. I mean, you don't like you're not super.  It's not like you're having daily comments in the group, but it was so cool to just see you were grinding for two years and you hit that.  Yeah, it's awesome. I just for the compliment.  And yeah, back in the day, I was posting heat, but haven't posted too much.  But it's always good to catch up with them. Everyone in the group.  Yeah, you know, so it's good to point out, Mike, is that Mike V has gotten to 40k.  And what has it been? Two and a half years, two years and some months.  What has it been? About two years. Yeah, two years.  He's got the 40k in two years. But what you guys might not have caught is that there was like a year of that that Mike basically just went and lived life.  Like he got to 10k and then he and that was his plan.  And that's what I love about Mike is he's very disciplined, but he's intentional.  And if like and that's what I think you guys need to realize is you don't have to be on all the time.  If you tell yourself, hey, I'm going to work four days a week",

So, Mike, for Mike, he got to 10k.  And then what do you spend like a year basically like just traveling because that's what you plan on doing.  Yeah, we got to 10k and then I traveled all over Southeast Asia for a whole year.  And then I was like, OK, let's scale it up.  Yeah, yeah, I remember that.  I remember you. That was your story.  And you're like, and you know what I admire about that is that was your plan.  And, you know, it's kind of like that.  Have you heard that song by Macklemore called Make the Money?  You ever heard that?  A really good song. It's called Make the it's like says make the money.  Don't let the money make you.  And it's like we have we make money not for money's sake.  We make money for a specific reason.  And so anyway, I just admire that you you had a plan.  You wanted to move to Thailand to have a lifestyle.  And you wanted this to fund the lifestyle.  And then once you did it, you went and executed.  And then when you decided to get busy, you decided to get busy.  And now you're at 40k.  And I have no doubt that if next year you decide to go and hit 100k, you're going to hit 100k.  I truly believe that.  So anyway, Matt Torres, shout out to Matt Torres.  And yeah, shout out to Mike for making it happen.  What else we got, Aaron, anything?  Yeah, for sure. We got like two questions here.  So Eric Funk says great conversation, guys.  I have a general Google ask question.  Are you setting keywords for exact match or phrase match or mix of both?  Yeah, I just run phrase match.  You know, concrete contractor, concrete specialist, concrete layer, concrete company.  I think concrete plus city, all is phrase match.  I would say that negative keywords can be you definitely want to consider those.  But even on top of that, you know, if you've got four campaigns live, which you should,  which is what I had at every given point leading up to leaving, you know,  you could set up the exact same campaign in a different city and get zero leads from it.  So yeah, just just set up the basics.  Use your phrase match.  But just remember that it's more important to have three guys on trials,  because not all of them are going to work, no matter what, how you what keywords you've got.  Absolutely. We got an action.  I'm just letting Jason in already.  We'll see if he closed that deal.  While you let Jason, I want to say one thing really quick.  That question lets me know that whoever that person is and not to call that person out,  but just like that person is the type that's there.  You're trying to avoid paying the piper.  OK, so and I can tell because that question is specific enough that you you've watched a lot of content.  You've listened to a lot of stuff.  You're doing everything except for paying the piper.  So you either got to pay the piper, you got to pay someone that pays the piper.  You know, you're not going to jump on and like every single little nuanced question.  This is all the stuff that's covered.  But the question I",

    "pageContent": "would ask that person is like, why are you wasting time trying to pick up a piece here,  pick up a piece there? Why not just go in and like get the full thing?  And so I could just tell by based on how specific that question is,  that you're trying to avoid doing everything but just paying the piper.  So for me, what I did is when I ran Google Ads, like for me, I bought I bought a program that spent eight grand.  That's how I learned the basics.  Then I spent up one point four million dollars learning ads.  That's how I learned the answers to questions you're asking.  Mike, he did the opposite.  He paid me.  I taught him ads and he learned.  And of course, he's learned other stuff since then through running his own campaigns.  But just to remind everyone, like we're going to do everything we can on these calls to get you guys value.  I mean, that was a great answer and a correct answer.  But just understand that like no matter what, no matter what way you slice it,  there are laws of the universe and you can't avoid them.  And one thing you can't do is you can't get a six pack without putting in work.  And I know there's some of these people out there taking ozempic, whatever, and or taking steroids to use the male example.  I know males use ozempic.  And I know they think they're cheating the system.  But if y'all don't think there's negative side effects to taking steroids or taking ozempic, we'll see.  We'll see.  There's no shortcut to a six pack.  There's no shortcut to a million dollars a year.  There's no shortcut to having a great relationship.  So that's just the facts.  Jason already did you close the deal or did he know show you?  Yeah, I closed it.  Yeah, buddy.  What'd you get?  Fourteen hundred per month in concrete.  My man.  Concrete saturated, Jason.  No, it is.  There's you just got to put in the due diligence, man.  Put in the work to find a good area and go get those deals.  It's crazy.  Amazing.  Fourteen hundred dollars a month deal.  Concrete live.  Yeah, Jason, it is saturated, bro.  Why are you still in concrete, dude?  Dude, did you guys not know rank and rent saturated?  Why you guys?  You know, honestly, like, is it as many people as you see in the rank and rent industry?  Like, you know, just this overall, like, I think there's so little people that are willing to take the action that we're willing to take over here and deal that.  It's not as saturated as you think.  There's so many sites that actually aren't being rented out, like you've mentioned several times.  And, you know, people can rate websites, but how many people are actually calling business owners and trying to close deals?  Not very many.  There's a lot of hungry business owners out there.  How much does that put you?  What are you at now per month?  I don't know if you lost any.  In the meantime, what are you at per month?  I'll have to go recount because I lost a twelve hundred dollar per month deal and then he's in a cold area.  So I'm going to we're still going to talk about it, but the lead slowed down, so I lost him.  So we're actually, I think I'm at thirteen, six hundred, but I got two more closing calls scheduled.  So we're going to get those numbers",

I know Laura's been on from the beginning.  She had asked, and Mike, this is more directed to you, but I'm sure Jason, I mean, you're at over 10K in like less than three months when you started to actually get focused.  But the question is, what are some mindset tips that helped you shift from 10K to 40K?  This is for Mike.  Yeah, this is mainly for Mike.  OK, also, what I want you to do while he's answering that question, Aaron, is I want you to screenshot everyone that's on this call so we can get them to reply.  Secondly, is I want you to drop a link for anybody that is that realizes that they would rather pay somebody that's paid the piper.  So drop a link to digital landlords for those that actually want to apply.  Again, you don't have to apply, guys. I'm going to keep showing up for these calls.  I'm going to keep being in the live group.  I guess I just sit there and I ask, why the hell are we still trying to avoid the thing that's got to happen?  So for those of you that are finally like, OK, it's time.  I want you to drop that link while Mike's answering the question.  So go ahead, Mike, answer that question.  What's the mindset shift that went from 10 to 40?  Yeah, from 10 to 40.  My mindset was pretty good because I honestly just wanted to make 2K a month.  That was my original goal. That was the price of freedom.  So hitting 10K a month, like, hey, if I was able to do something that I previously thought was completely impossible, then, you know, I've got supreme confidence and literally just picking.  It was just like I said before, just pick a number and then work back from what that version of Laura or whoever it is is doing.  And I think on the side note, being around other people who are making similar numbers can definitely help because that will just make everything more real.  You know, everyone's talking about 40K or, you know, what are these people doing that you're not kind of thing?  Like Nick says, it's not it's equally about what you need to do to get there, but also what you need to not do.  And a big part of that is keeping things simple.  You know what I was just going to say is I was going to say, I don't know if you guys have noticed on this interview, but Mike, Mike's not telling like and this is what I noticed this about everyone doing big numbers, right?  And Dalton, the same thing. It's like, Mike, like when you guys ask Mike questions, he's giving you very simple answers.  And I think probably maybe some of you guys are expecting like some intricate answer or this crazy niche that he's in or do this little hack or whatever.  And it's like I've learned more than anything, being around people that are successful, that the people that are making the most money are the ones that are just disciplined in doing the simple stuff that works and disciplined in not doing the stuff that does not move the needle.  That's it. And I could tell Mike, you're very disciplined in not doing what shouldn't be done and doing what should be done.  I'll kind of say one more thing. Just what you said to me in our last interview, you know, when I was making 8K a month, you",

They said, if you've made $1,000 doing this business model, you have a $1,000 a month client, why don't you have 100 of those?  Why are you trying to reinvent the wheel? Why aren't you just doing that 100 times? Or why don't you, instead of doing 100 times, why don't you double your price and do it 50 times?  And I was like, yeah, that's what I should do. I should stop trying to do SEO, build websites, do consulting, do social media management.  Why don't I just do this one thing that works really, really well and just do it 100 times? And that's when I scaled up to 100K.  And it was like, I think I'm just so stupid. I needed to hear an answer that was that simple. And it was like, oh, yeah, that makes sense.  That's such a good answer. Just do it. Do it 100 more times. It's so simple.  That's it. It's like that phrase, kiss, keep it stupid, stupid, simple, or keep it simple.  For me, it's keep it simple, stupid, right? Either one.  Just gotta get that first deal and then that's it. Just do it 50 more times, 10 more times, whatever number it is that will allow you to live the lifestyle that you want.  Guys, it's not rocket science. I keep saying rocket scientists. It's been a long weekend. It's not rocket science. I'm nothing special.  I know, speaking for me, I know that everyone else on this call, Mike, Jason, these guys have really special qualities, but they weren't born with some...  We're not Bill Gates caliber minds. We're just people that are simple, doing the simple work, but doing it again and again and again, even though we don't feel like doing it.  Doing it on a... Jason just barely scheduled a closing call on a Monday at 7 a.m. That just shows you where his head's at. He's grinding, man. I love that.  So, Mike V, thank you for being on the call, man. Do you have anything else you want to add, Aaron?  I think we're good. Great call.  Amazing call. For those of you that were on this call, we're going to get you guys to replay and we will be doing another call next week.  But again, I would just recommend, guys, if you actually are serious about making money, you either got to just hunker down and say, hey, I'm going to do what Nick did and spend five years and $1.4 million,  or you can do what Mike did, and it's a much quicker option to say, hey, let's just get the blueprint. Same with Jason, same with Aaron, and let's go and learn that and get there quicker.  And basically, Mike's basically got to $40K in a year because he took a year off, but obviously we can't say that, but essentially getting to $40K in a year.  So anyway, that said, guys, and Jason, I think Jason started in January. He's eight, nine months into this, 10 months into this, and he's at almost",

So basically what we like to do,  our Mr. Business Owner, is we start off with a 12-month trial or a six-month trial, right? Or if  you have to, a three-month trial. It's a contract. It's the same thing, but they like the sound of  it because then they don't feel like it's like this long-term thing. So we just term it. We just  coin it like trial, but it's not. It's the deal.

    "pageContent": " Guys, happy Monday.  February 24th.  Time is cruising by, which is not a bad thing when you're getting stuff done.  One thing I want to say really quick, I actually told my, I think a lot of you guys are inside  of Digital Landlords, so I'm going to just remind you guys, if you have not ever, or  even if you have, I highly, highly, highly, highly, highly recommend you guys read this  book.  It's called The Slight Edge, okay?  I'll show you the cover here real quick.  I cannot recommend this book enough.  I've got, yeah, Craig Smith, he's reading it, awesome, okay.  So this is what the cover looks like, okay, it's called The Slight Edge.  I'm on page 205, I don't know if that's, I'm on chapter 14, so I've just been reading  10 pages a day, and guys, this book has just reminded me that it's all the little things  that you do that add up to the success, and you're going to start reading this today,  and you're going to start to implement some little things, and you're not going to see  any results at the beginning.  It's going to feel like the exact same thing, whether it's, you know, let's just talk with  the business, right?  You're going to start to implement some things with the business.  Maybe your goal is, I'm going to make five cold calls, I'm going to make sure every single  day I talk to five business owners, I talk to five business owners with cold calling,  okay?  Not call, but talk to, and you're going to do it the first day, and you might not even  get anybody that's interested, and maybe the second day and the third day, you might do  it for a week.  You might do it for two weeks, because at the beginning your pitch isn't great, and  then what's going to happen is after a week, two weeks, you're going to start seeing that  somebody that you called day three actually calls you back, or somebody that you called,  you know, on day four that didn't answer, got your voice note, your voice memo, they  called you, they're interested, and all of a sudden all these little things that you  They start to stack up, and it's like everything is going in your way, and you have this thing  called momentum, and it's a beautiful feeling.  I have it right now.  I started this book literally a month ago, because I got back, I was in, I remember,  it was about this exact same day, almost exactly a month ago I started it.  I picked it up, I was kind of like, you know, I need to just get back to basics, fundamentals,  picked up the book, just read 10 pages, and then did it again, did it again, did it again,  and guys, it's been really, really good.  I've seen, I mean, I've got a lot of momentum, I feel good.  It's not just my business too, it's my physical, my, what other side of it.  I feel like with my physical definitely, with my relationships, so anyway, I don't make  any money off this book, I don't know Jeff Olson, all I can tell you is that I've recommended  this book to not just my digital landlords group, but I've recommended this to a bunch  of people that I know and care about.  So guys, go grab it.  This is one of my top five books, maybe my top three books, along with Think and Grow ",

So there is a PDF that I shared, you can grab, just for ease of, I'll just go like this,  the Slide Edge PDF, let me just grab it for you guys to make it easy.  You can just type in the Slide Edge PDF and you're also going to find it, but let me just  go like this and I'll drop it in.  Okay, so yeah, you guys can get the PDF there, I like it on the Kindle so I can highlight  stuff and come back to it, drop notes in it, but anyway, all right guys, that is that.  What else was I going to say really quick before we dive into the questions, let's see.  Okay, here we go, let me show you guys.  All right, and I'm doing this because I know not everyone's on right now, but I'm going  to share my screen really quick for, let's see, we got Craig, Kevin, Paul, Simon, okay.  There's the PDF by the way.  Okay, last week, and I think a couple weeks ago too, I said, hey guys, when you go through  the classroom here, there's this mini course called Community World Map, okay, and I asked  everyone to put their location.  Why does it matter if you put your location, well, you don't have to put your location,  but I think it's really cool to put your location because, well, first of all, it's interesting  to look at.  Number two, it's cool because if you're traveling or you're anywhere and you want to link up  with somebody, you can just go and look at who's in that area, right.  We have over 250 members.  If everyone would fill this out, which a lot of us are in this area, it would be so interesting  to see where everybody's at, so I'm going to, I think I wasn't super clear and I didn't  even know this.  So I thought all you had to do, guys, is go, this is what I thought.  I thought you went to your profile, you went to your settings, and you changed your location.  That's what I thought, okay.  It's not the case.  What you got to do is you got to go here, you got to go to the classroom, you're going  to go to the map, of course, and then you're going to see this little purple button here.  You're just going to click on this and you're going to put add a location, okay.  Now I'm going to go back to another window here.  You're going to grab your, you're going to go to your profile and you're going to grab  this and you're just going to go into here and drop that.  Nicholas Wood, and then I'm going to put my location as Freetown.  I'm in the U.S. right now, but I'm going to be in Freetown in two weeks, so I'll put Freetown  and I'll submit it, and boom, there we go.  It drops me right here into Freetown, okay.  So guys, if you haven't done this already, it takes, what did that take me, 15 seconds?  Go do it.  I think it's so, I think it's really cool to look at first and foremost, and I think  it's so interesting to be able to connect with people and to just build the network.  I mean, guys, we're all trying to do the same thing and we're all at different stages of  the game.  We all come with",

Simon says, can you highlight the difference between the mini course and the digital language  program?  Yes.  So in a nutshell, Simon, this group right now, thanks Paul for doing that by the way,  this program that you're in right now, this Rankin' Rankin' Academy, the school community,  if you are in digital language, you have full access to this.  I think Craig, Kevin, and Paul, I think are all in digital language, if I'm not mistaken.  And essentially, this is just a place to get your feet wet, okay.  This is a place to understand from a conceptual level, the model, to get some pointers on  how to get started, to start seeing some wins in terms of like just moving the needle and  getting going, okay.  But digital landlords is when you do it for real.  So that's going to have everything and anything related to this.  It's going to have all the scripts.  It's going to have, I mean, it's got everything that you can possibly imagine.  And so like everything, if something new comes up, if I'm testing something new with ads,  I share it in there.  If I have this new strategy that I'm doing for prospecting, I share it in there.  It's basically got every single thing.  It's the blueprint.  So that is what digital landlords is.  So this is just the starter.  This is where you start and determine, hey, I want to go into this model for real.  And as soon as you are like, hey, I want to do this for real, then you go in and get into  digital landlords.  Okay.  One thing I will show you really quick on that note is if you, Simon, you should go  check out chapter 14.  If I can find it off the top of my head, let's see here.  I'm guessing here.  Let's see if I'm close on 14.  I think I'm a little further.  Okay.  So let me go right here.  This is the section.  Again, this is a, oh here, 13.  Go read this.  I read this last night.  This chapter called Learn from Mentors.  And this is such an amazing chapter.  And I don't tell you to do this just because I think, oh, if he'll read this, he's going  to get into our program.  No.  But even me reading this, I love this chapter.  And he shares this really amazing story about this guy that just gave him a little bit of  time every single day.  And he started to see himself differently and it completely changed his life.  But anyway, there's some good stuff that I highlighted.  I didn't read it on here.  I read it on right here.  Let me just read this one part, okay?  Let's go like this.  Whatever goals you aspire to, seek out people who have achieved the same or very similar  goals or who are well along that path and go camp on their doorstep or do whatever you  can to associate with them, emulate them, and let their grasp, understanding, and mastery  of the subject rub off on you.  What makes AA so successful is not the information they hand out.  It's the mentorship they provide, both as a community and as individuals.  When you join AA or any other 12-step program, you get instant access to a community of people  who have gone where you're going as well as an individual, mentor, or sponsor.  So",

You can read chapter 13 completely free today, and I think it's going to open your mind on  a lot of things.  Okay?  So yeah, go check it out.  Phenomenal book.  So let's keep going.  Was one more thing I wanted to cover.  Oh, yeah, this is exciting.  Guys, I got a new course dropping in March, just as a heads up, okay?  I've got a new course.  This is going to be a course that, again, for you guys that are in Digital Landlords,  all the stuff that I produce in here, you guys are going to get access to, and it's  probably just a, anything that I produce in here is probably just going to be a fraction  of something that I already have inside of Digital Landlords, okay?  But I will tell you guys, I do have a new course dropping inside of here in March.  So keep an eye out for that as well, okay?  And then lastly, guys, is just a reminder of the replays.  As soon as this call gets done, I upload it to Vimeo, I message my VA, and he waits for  it, he grabs it, and he puts it up within literally like an hour or two hours.  Let me show you one more thing, and then I'm going to go into Q&A.  Okay, guys, let me show you one last thing.  Okay, last thing I want to show you guys is something that I think is really helpful.  So as soon as you get off, you can check this out.  So if you go here, you go down to the replays right here, the replay will be dropped.  So you can see here, this is our kickoff call, so this is our 1, 2, 3, 4, 5th, this  is our 6th week, right, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6th, I'm actually going to have him add the date.  I'll make a note to have him add the date today because I want you guys to be able to  see the date, let me write that down, add dates, dates to replay.  But needless to say, guys, what I like about these, we just started doing, is you can go  to it and we actually put the questions in the description that we answer.  So last week we covered, are there niches that are not region-specific, what is the  backlink data and where is the backlink data from, where are they coming from, like we  go through everything, do one-page websites rank well, all the questions that were asked,  we put in the description.  So you can go to these Q&As and be like, all right, is any of this stuff things that I  actually am interested in or that I have questions about, and then you don't have to go and watch  the entire thing, okay?  Maybe what I should try to do is see if I can do a timestamp, I'll add that as well,  make it even easier for you guys.  But I also want you guys to be on these lives, so maybe I shouldn't make it too easy on you  guys.  I like when you guys are on these lives, it gives me a lot of energy to be able to talk  to you guys live.  Even if no one showed up to this, I would still do these calls, but yeah, just so you  guys know.  All right, guys, what questions do you have?  Let's get into that.",

Oh, that's why I already recommended this book in this group as well, I'm sorry.  That's why people said they're reading it.  Book is changing my life, I forgot.  I was so pumped.  After I started seeing the results of this book, I started sharing it with everybody.  Okay, let's see.  I don't know if there was any.  Let me go under the question section, let's see.  There's any new stuff?  If not, I'll go into, I have another place I'll answer questions to make it easy for  you guys, but I'm going to keep an eye on the chat here.  So, guys, if you guys have any questions, let me know.  This is what I'll do.  I'm going to go over to, I'm going to go over to YouTube really quick.  I always get interesting questions here.  Let's see.  All right, I'm going to go to my comments to see what questions we have.  Here's a good question.  I'm going to answer.  Guys, again, I'm going to prioritize your questions.  I'm just going to start going through a few questions in YouTube and then also in the  Facebook group and obviously, school, if I see anything pop up, but yeah, I'll prioritize  your questions as they come up, okay?  So this is a question that somebody had.  This was on a video that I posted on YouTube that was talking about how the rank and rep  business has changed.  This person said this.  He said, in terms of saturation, do newbies stand a chance against seasoned agencies?  So let's just say, let's take Simon, for example.  Simon just started doing this.  I think he did.  Does Simon have a chance to do this against somebody like myself who's been doing this  since 2016 and been seriously doing this since 2020?  That's the question.  Well, the truth is, guys, is that it's the wrong question because this person's thinking  about this in terms of a scarcity mindset.  They're thinking about this in terms of if they get a deal, then it's taking one out  of my pocket, or if I get a deal, it's taking one out of their pockets.  It's a scarcity mindset, right?  The success that Paul has, or the success that Craig has, has nothing to do with me.  It doesn't affect me.  It doesn't take money out of my pocket.  That's something that people get confused.  Just because Paul goes and lands a deal today does not take money out of my pocket.  Here's a good example.  My little brother, he just called me on Saturday and he was like, and by the way, for those  of you in digital landlords, tomorrow we're going to be doing a post that's going to let  you guys know this.  We're going to be doing a really interesting live, a very value driven live on how to replace  clients quickly.  You get those clients, they're bad, sorry, how to replace bad clients quickly.  He ended up finding out he had two bad clients and he's at 10.6.  He's like, I don't want to go back.  I want to replace them as soon as possible.  He actually replaced two clients on Saturday back to back.  He's going to be sharing those strategies.  He called me and he told me this story and he's like, yeah, I landed these two",

    "pageContent": "clients.  Guys, I didn't think in my head, oh, Porter got two more deals.  That's two deals that I could have got.  The question is flawed because just because this person gets a deal or just because Paul  or Craig or Simon or anybody else in this call gets a deal does not take it out of my  pocket.  You got to be, guys, think about this and maybe I should answer the bigger question  which is, is ranking rent saturated?  That's the question that everybody's asked from the beginning.  That's the question that I asked.  Basically, the question is this, guys.  The question I was asking when I first got started was, did I miss the opportunity?  Should I have done this five years ago?  The answer is, yeah, of course.  It's like that old saying, when is the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago.  That one's the best time today.  Of course, I should have started five years before I even did.  The best time to start is now.  If you really think about the amount of businesses out there, if you think about the amount of  Let's see how many new businesses start in, let's just say the US and the United States  every year.  There are four points on average.  There are 4.7 million businesses started every year.  So guys, and that's not even to mention all the new industries that are created.  That's not even all like people that are saying this is saturated are looking at this from  one niche and they're looking at it from one angle and they're saying, oh my gosh, everyone's  talking about concrete.  Okay.  Yes.  If you start looking for a concrete website, it is going to be more difficult to find a  concrete website that's low hanging fruit than it was four years ago.  Yes.  But guys, you're also forgetting the fact that just because you go into a city and you  see my website, that doesn't mean you can't come in there as well.  Okay.  There's so many levels to this, but to say that this business is saturated is ridiculous.  It's still unknown.  This business is still unknown.  You still cannot go to somebody and say, hey, I'm in the ranking business and they know  what you're talking about.  They have no idea.  And then once you tell them exactly what it is, they're like, oh, that's super smart.  You're like, yeah, I build these simple websites.  They cost me 80 bucks to build and I rank them and then I rent them out and get paid  passively.  And you're like, yeah, that's genius.  I never hear anything besides that.  That's genius.  Okay.  So it's not saturated.  At least that's my opinion.  And that's the opinion that I've always chosen to follow.  And guys, it's served me very, very well.  Okay.  Paul says money and opportunity is limited by the way, Kevin said he updated his location.  Paul says money and opportunity is unlimited.  I'm doing concrete right now and see many opportunities.  Yes.  My brother Porter, he started like properly doing this business two years ago.  Yeah.  About two years ago.  Okay.  That kid has only done concrete.  This is like a year, year after we started talking only about concrete.  Everyone is doing concrete.  Everyone's talking about concrete.  He still is getting concrete deals.

Let me give you guys, I want to share something with you guys that I actually found out or  that I, that I've been trying.  So Francesca and I, if you didn't, if you're not following on YouTube, then that's fine.  But you should because we're sharing a lot of stuff this year that's more of like stuff  that we're doing.  Okay.  And Francesca and I, as I've mentioned, our goal is to get to $10,000 per month with the  agency of new business in the, in the first quarter.  Okay.  And when I say we, that means her, I'm not doing it.  I'm not doing sales calls.  I'm not doing anything.  I'm just advising.  I talked to her on Mondays.  I talked to her on Wednesdays.  I talked to her on Fridays about the business.  That's it.  Okay.  30 minutes each.  Sometimes it goes a little bit longer, sometimes a little bit shorter.  I'm talking to her total about an hour to an hour and a half is what I'm advising her  on how to run the agency.  So we started looking at our goals.  We reviewed our goals.  Okay.  And our, I was like, yeah, our goal is $10,000 per month by the end of quarter one.  So this is about a week and a half ago.  I'm like, Hey, what are we at?  And she's like, we haven't gotten any deals yet.  Now granted, I didn't set these goals until the beginning of February.  So this is like two, three weeks into this, maybe even two weeks.  And so we sat down.  We had this whiteboard session in my office and just kind of strategize on what we can  do to make sure that we get to 10 K.  And we realized that if we're going to get to 10 K of not per month, because we're, we're  way past 10 K per month, 10 K in new business in quarter one, then we're going to have to  do some stuff that's scrappy, some stuff that's unconventional, some stuff that's not exactly  the stuff that I'd be doing longterm.  And so we had three columns.  We had short term, medium term, long term was like, what can we actually do to hit the  10 K?  Okay.  This was the conversation that we had.  And we started coming up with ideas and, and a lot of those ideas guys were things that  were not super scalable.  They're not things that are something that you could do over and over and over again,  but they are hustle things.  Okay.  One of the things that we did is we went and went, and this is the one strategy I want  to give you guys is we went in and I have a, so if you either, either if you have websites  that are generating a few leads that you want to sell, or if you've looked at a city and  niche and it looks like a really good opportunity, you've done the due diligence, here's a little  strategy that you may want to try.  Okay.  Is I went in with my profile and I went in and I found some strategic Facebook groups  in inside, in Facebook.  Okay.  It's one of the Facebook groups and I went into these, these groups.  One of them was a biz buy sell.  Okay.  And so whatever",

You go to Roswell biz buy sell, you go to Roswell yard sale, online yard sale, whatever  you go to these groups and you go and join these groups in these cities.  Okay.  Now, if you haven't made any posts or interactions in there, you may want to do just a few just  to make it look like you're not brand new.  But if this is in your hometown, then it makes it a little bit easier because you're probably  going to have some mutual contact.  So you're not going to look like you're a scam.  So we went into these groups and we just wrote up this simple copy.  And we made a quick post.  It wasn't big.  It wasn't long.  It didn't seem salesy.  And it basically said something like this.  It said, it said, Hey, does here, I'll actually read the text for you guys and I'll copy the  post for you guys.  And I'll, I'll drop it real quick.  Hold on.  Let me go and find the post real quick because we've already had some hits on this thing.  And I think we're going to be able to, to have some sales calls based on this real quick.  Let me just pull this up loading here.  There it is.  I put this on last night.  All right.  I'm going to copy this for you guys.  I don't know if this will let me.  All right.  I don't know if it'll let me drop it, but here's what it says.  Can anyone recommend a good blank?  Okay.  So whatever that is, can anyone recommend a good concrete company, a good fencing company?  So that was it.  Can anyone recommend a good blank?  And then I put space.  I put question mark space, preferably someone who is not super booked out, have two referrals  that need work done.  Okay.  Simple little text.  I didn't put in there.  I generate leads and I've got a website and I need somebody to work with.  I just put, can anyone recommend a good blank?  Preferably someone who is not super booked out, have two referrals that need work done.  Okay.  I've already got eight comments on this thing.  Um, somebody, somebody said, uh, they tagged somebody else.  Hey, does Kenny have time?  There's a referral.  And by the way, this is somebody who's like not even advertising online.  So I don't know if it's going to be the greatest.  Then somebody else says, uh, do you have an excavator?  And by the way, the niches excavation, do you have an excavator?  Is this a full-time thing or a quick project?  Probably not somebody I'm going to reach out to.  Then I have somebody that, that reaches out and says this, he says, we, and this guy actually  knows who I am.  He goes, we could do trade.  I need help with my websites and I want, I want to build two more.  So I don't know what this guy's referring to.  If he, so if he's got, uh, you know, he does the comment before says he has an excavator.  Okay.  So now I have somebody I can talk to.  Then I have another one.  It guy just barely comment and says, we're at, we do excavation work and he tags his  own business, which by the way, I believe is also in the same city.  Okay.  So right there, I just",

If I can drop this, um, let's see if I can drop a picture here, where's that?  Hold on.  I don't know if I can file.  Okay.  I'll try to draw what I'll try to do, guys.  I'll try to drop it in the, uh, as a comment or something.  Let me add Carlo into here, by the way.  So anyway, guys, just a super easy, quick strategy that you guys can use to find warm  prospects.  It always helps if you're, you know, let's, this would be good guys in the situation where  you've tried, you build a list, you tried to cold call, didn't have any luck and you're  just looking for more people that would work, um, where you're already getting leads.  It would work in a situation where you already have a website and it's getting a few leads,  but you haven't sold it yet.  It could work in a situation where you've just found the city and found the niche and  you're running the ads and you're waiting for the ads to kick in.  You could also do that strategy, but guys, it's, it's been like, I made that post  on Friday.  That's all that I did is made that simple little post and we've already gotten two feedback  or two hits.  Okay.  So, um, according to this says Paul says we use a very similar strategy and crush it.  So there you go.  That was just a little, little thing that I tried and it worked really well.  We've got a bunch of different things we're going to be trying guys back to the book that  I recommended back to the slide edge.  It's all these little things that you're doing, all these little things, these little places  that you're letting people know what you do.  All the, yeah, I know it's not sustainable necessarily to do, uh, a hundred different  posts all over the place, but guys, all the little things that you're doing, all the conversations  that you're having, that person that you told that the gym that you do lead generation,  the person that you're sitting in the sauna with to ask what you do, um, these things  all add up and, uh, yeah, they're there.  At some point you start to realize, Hey, that guy I talked to like two months ago, he hit  me back up and he's, he's ready to, to work with me.  Okay.  All right, let's keep going.  All right, let's see.  Here's another one.  This is not something that's a question, but it kind of is a question.  So, uh, somebody said this, I had this, again, I made this video that said how the game has  changed and this person made kind of a snarky comment and said, yes, if you constantly focus  on SEO.  Okay.  And they're making this, this thing.  So really the question is like, can you do this business?  I guess the question, if I were to phrase it, would be that they're asking is like,  how much SEO, how much ongoing SEO do you need to do on these websites to keep them  ranked?  Okay.  Guys, um, not much.  I'm going to show you a couple of examples here.  Okay.  Here's my YouTube comments.  I'm looking at, by the way.  Okay.  So let's go like this. ",

You guys have heard me use this example.  This is my site right here, Bentonville concrete.com.  You can say, I just want to show you how well it's ranked.  So I'm ranked here.  Let me see if you guys can actually see it.  Zoom in a little bit.  This is my site here, Bentonville concrete.  This is my, um, math listing, Bentonville concrete.  This is my Facebook page, Bentonville concrete is ranked.  So my page is ranked number one.  My map is ranked number one and my Facebook page is ranked number two.  Okay.  Keep going.  I don't know if I have any more listings on page one, but I, I have two of the top, well  technically in the organic listings.  Let's go like this.  Let's change this around a little bit and put concrete contractors Bentonville AR.  Okay.  Ranked number two and then I'm ranked number one and I'm ranked number two.  And that's not even my Facebook page either.  So I've got the two top spots in the organic and the second spot in the map pack.  Why do I tell you this, friends, I have not logged into this website.  God is my witness.  I'll, I'll, I'll triple check with Francesca, but God is my witness personally.  I have not logged.  I don't even know how to log into the website.  I'm sure that I have the password saved.  It's been two to three years, two to three years since I've logged on the website.  The only thing that we've been doing is the business owner has taken some accountability.  He's helping us to get reviews.  That's it.  We have not logged into the website.  In fact, the business owner came to us recently and said to us, Hey, we want, I would love  to add this and that he printed off.  He went and he printed off all the content.  He highlighted the stuff that he wanted to remove.  And in fact, I'm going to message him after this because I think I can squeeze in for  another deal.  Um, so we were talking about doing something and I'm going to, I'm going to mention this  here in a second.  Anyway, guys, he's like, Hey, can we change this?  Can we change this?  And I told him, I said, look, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.  Okay.  So I'm not touching the site.  This thing is ranking like a champ.  It's glued to the top.  Now, why?  Well, because I did a really good due diligence.  I caught this website.  I built this website the perfect time before the, the, well, probably around the same time,  but I knew business was booming.  I used to live in Bentonville.  I used to do door to door sales in Bentonville.  I saw the houses going up.  I saw the economy.  I saw the cars people drove.  I knew that Walmart had a policy they were implementing where if you worked, if you sold  products to Walmart, you had to have an office in Bentonville, Arkansas.  I knew all these things.  I knew there was also JB Hunt.  I knew Tyson Chicken was there.  I had all this Intel because I lived there and I just made this bet.  And I did the research back, guys, back in the day when I built Bentonville concrete,  when you looked at",

It was like two, three months because no one was trying to rank.  There was no competition.  Right?  So I built this website and it ranks, but because I did such good due diligence, guys,  this thing is glued to the top.  So the reason I'm telling you this is this person that's like telling me, yeah, unless  you focus on SEO, no, you don't have to focus on SEO.  You have to do, do good due diligence.  You have to know what to look for in a city and niche.  And then it's glued to the top and there's not much upkeep.  That's one website.  Okay.  I'll give you one more.  This one right here I built in St. George, towing St. George, Utah, okay.  Right here, towingstgeorge.com.  Rank number one, towingstgeorge.com.  Rank number two.  Okay.  See another, I, by the way, I tell you this.  I haven't logged into this website.  Look at this website guys.  It's hideous.  I haven't logged into this.  I think we, we sold this in 2020.  We have not added content.  We have not added backlinks.  We have not done anything in five years.  This thing's glued to the top.  It's making us like five, 600 bucks per month.  Not, not anything crazy on autopilot.  Okay.  I don't even think we run ads.  Let me double check here.  Let me go back.  Maybe we run a little bit.  I don't even think we run ads.  No, I don't think so.  I don't think we run any ads at all.  Okay.  So anyway, you do not, if the key is not the SEO, the key is doing the, the, the, the due  diligence.  So guys, for those of you that are in digital landlords, go follow the due diligence process  to a freaking tee.  Everything that I tell you to do, if it says that the CPC needs to be, make sure it says  if it says that you need to look for this sign, this sign before you go into it, do  that.  If, if this, if I tell you that the search volume needs to be the minimum of this, go  and do it.  If you do these, even if you got to look at a hundred of these things, guys, it's going  to be worth it.  If you don't have to look at a hundred cities and niches to find one, it's going to be worth  it.  Okay.  Because it's going to, you're going to have projects like this.  You're going to build five years later, no upkeep, no nothing.  You're making 600 bucks a month and it's still paying you every single month.  Okay.  And luckily with rank and rent engine, you guys are not using that.  I, you don't have to, but it's made due diligence so freaking fast.  You can go bust out 20 due diligence in an hour, maybe a little bit less than that.  And you can go look at 20 cities.  So in one day you could have a VA.  Once you train them, you can have a VA look at a hundred cities in a day, right?  You look at a hundred cities in a day for five days, you go look at 500 cities, you  find five projects to",

Sometimes I'll be talking and I have thoughts that I want to just make sure I don't forget.  Okay.  What else we got?  I'm not sure what that question is.  That's in the spam.  What else?  What else?  What else?  Okay.  Somebody said, yo, I'm 23 year old Russian American.  Let me know if you want to work together.  That's not really a question, but one thing I'll say is that I don't care where you're  at.  You guys can make this strategy work.  I just did an interview with a guy named Pierre, Pierre Goddard.  Some of you guys might know him from some of the other groups that you guys are in.  This guy is in France.  Sorry.  He's from France, French accent, living in Thailand and he's targeting France.  He's making a little over $12,000 per month and he's exclusively targeting France.  Okay.  If you're in Russia, you can target Russia.  If you're in freaking wherever, you can target wherever.  If people search the same way that we do in the U.S., okay.  There's a lot of interesting countries that I'm looking at.  So that's just a quick thought, guys.  If you're in a country besides the U.S., you want to target your country, you should, okay.  Let's see.  Here in terms of questions, I think we pretty much hit it.  Somebody right here just dropping three spam comments.  That's good.  Okay.  Let's go to, yeah, pretty much everything's spam there.  All right.  If anyone has, doesn't have questions, I'll keep going.  Paul, he says, is there any keyword campaigns available for PPC for concrete?  Quick follow up question to that, Paul, just drop in the comments.  Are you talking about like a keyword list or what do you mean by a keyword campaign?  If you don't mind, just clarify that really quick while I jump into the Facebook group  and answer some questions that people had.  Okay.  Let's go here.  All right.  I got one right there.  Let me just clarify, Paul.  Paul, when you can, just clarify what you're talking about when you say, is there any keywords  campaigns available for PPC?  Okay.  All right.  While that's happening, guys, here's a question by Tim Johnson.  He says, I've used Pakistan guys for GMB before and had luck on $300 ones, but dude's Facebook  profile disappeared.  Anyone have a reliable source for done for you GMBs verified?  Guys, I'm not a fan of messing with the GMB, especially with outsourced Pakistanis.  Okay.  I'm all about doing the GMB the right way, the white hat way, the clean way, using the  business owner.  Like for example, we have a business owner here in town and he actually has come to the  office with his truck, with his business cards, with his stuff.  And we've done a video call with him at the office with Google.  Okay.  I got no problems with that.  I'm not doing fake reviews.  I'm not doing Pakistani freaking",

I'm trying to build something that I can, I can, that we can have around for years and  years that can continue to produce cash.  And I'm not just going to take shortcuts.  Okay.  I'm going to do it the right way.  So I don't do this stuff.  So in terms of like do it done for you, GMB, I just don't mess with it.  Okay.  There was somebody that did recommend a, somebody that did recommend a source, but the guy that  recommended it, I don't trust greatly.  So I'm not really sure I would recommend that either.  Okay.

If you want to reach out and do this for me, send me and Francesca a Facebook message.  Wait until I get off the stream so I can respond, explain what you're looking for.  I'll put a voice note out that says, Hey, here's what he's trying to do.  And I'll tell her, you know, sometimes Francesca, she goes, she's like, can you not tell people  about all of our websites?  Because she kind of has a little bit of a scarcity mentality sometimes.  And I'm like, no, it doesn't matter.  So anyway, she might want to just screenshot it and just send you a certain parts of it.  But anyway, Paul, message both of us and we'll try to get you something if possible.  Okay.  Apology.  Simon says, apologies, can't see an update to Community World Map.  Simon, just grab your, okay, if it's not working, what I would like you to do is once we get  off this call, make a quick little loom and show me what you're trying to do.  And I'll try to figure out why it's not working.  But you should be able to just grab your username, copy and paste it, plug it in, and you should  be good to go.  Okay.  If not, just send me a loom and I'll look into it.  I'll have Ashley look into it.  Okay.  Paul says, there is a lot of scammers out there right now for GMB.  Tread with caution.  Do not pay upfront.  A thousand percent.  GMBs are just spending like crazy.  I lost any properties.  That's why I'm shipping.  Yeah.  That's a great point.  I forgot Paul.  Paul had a huge stake in the GMB stuff and here we are.  So anyway, Paul, great feedback.  Crank head to bounce.  Okay.  Let me answer like one or two more questions.  But again, Simon send me loom and we will, I'll get it.  I'll check it out.  Okay.  Let's see what else we got here.  I mean, there's not a ton of questions, which is great.  Yeah.

Some people want to know if you need to have like an LLC set up for each of these individual  properties or maybe let's say you have your, your actual LLC and then you have a DBA, right?  So you have your main company.  My company's called Evergreen and then I could go and have my attorney or my accountant set  it up and have it like Evergreen leads LLC or I think it's actually called Evergreen  Enterprises, the legal name Evergreen, Evergreen leads LLC DBA Bentonville concrete and I could  actually go set up a DBA for each one of these websites.  Do you need to do that?  I don't think it's necessary.  Some people do like to do it.  I think sometimes it will help with the GMB and these kinds of things, but I'm asking,  I'm saying this because somebody was asking about LLC and I don't know if that's exactly  the question they were asking, but you don't have to do this guys.  If you're looking to take extra precautions, then I think I went and worked this out with  my attorney when I was asking him and he's like, yeah, we can work out a deal where anytime  you had a new site, I would just do a DBA for you.  It costs you this much money and then it would be checked off and it would be done.  So that's something that you could do guys, but again, I think sometimes people overthink  this.  I've never had to do a DBA on any of my websites.  Only thing that I would make sure to put is a privacy policy, put a terms of service page  into your website.  Other than that, that's really it.  The easier thing to do to be cautious is in the bottom of the footer, make some kind of  note that says like, this is a third party company that sends business to Joe's concrete  and we do not actually do the work, whatever verbiage that sounds better than that.  You could actually take their licensing number and paste it in the footer to really save  your butt if you're concerned about that.  I've never had any issues.  I wouldn't worry about that.  It's not a huge deal, okay?  So that said guys, again, Paul messaged me and Francesca.  I'll try to help you out.  Simon sent me a loom.  I'll also try to look at that as well.  And guys, it's February 24th.  Let's get at it.  This last week that just passed, we got a little tiny deal.  You guys probably saw Francesca's post, 300 bucks a month, nothing to write home about,  nothing crazy.  300 bucks a month times 12 is $3,600 a year.  That ain't something I'm going to turn away.  And guess what?  Every single one of those $300 adds up.  $300 here, by the way, that's pure profit.  That's pure profit because that's a website that we had a client for, we lost a client  for.  It never was ranking super well.  We haven't really focused on it.  It was just generating a few leads.  So now we're making 300 bucks that we weren't making, okay?  Every deal counts.  Every phone call counts.  Everything that you do adds up, okay?  Go read the slide edge.  Simon, I would highly recommend you read chapter 13 and if you have any questions, reach out  to me.  But guys, with that said, guys, don't be afraid in my business",

    "pageContent": "right now.  I'm not afraid to do things that are unscalable.  I'm not afraid to reach out to somebody.  Like for example, I'll give you one last thing as I go.  We had this person that we got on the phone with on a sales call on Saturday, okay?  And yes, we run Saturday calls because why not?  Why not start the day, why not start the weekend with some new money?  So we had this guy, we jumped on and we didn't close him.  I didn't stay on the whole time.  I just jumped off for a second just to make myself known.  He didn't close.  And after I got his number and I text him and I sent him a few texts, I sent him a two  and a half minute voice note and throughout the day yesterday I was texting this guy back  and forth, okay?  Is this something I could do with every single deal?  I have salespeople, that's their job, whatever, whatever, whatever.  Should I be doing it?  You could argue, no, I shouldn't be doing it.  Some people probably would tell me I'm stupid.  I am hungry, man.  I want the deals.  I'm willing to do it.  I'm willing on a Sunday to message the guy and just say, hey, I know it's Sunday, I don't  work on Sunday.  I just want to send you a message and say this, that, and this, that, and the rest.  I would love to, whatever, let's talk again on Monday.  I've got some ideas and the guy agreed.  The guy messaged back, hey, thanks for the text, Nick.  I really appreciate it.  I could see how much you actually care about your business and I would love to jump back  on a Zoom call on Monday and see what you're talking about and we're going to come to this  guy with some different options than what we gave him and see if we can close the deal.  Is it practical?  Is it scalable?  Probably not, okay?  To do that with every single client, especially as you scale, probably not, but guys, do unscalable  things to pick up the momentum.  You guys just got to get that first deal.  You got to get that second deal.  If it's been a while since you got a deal, go do whatever you got to do to get that deal.  Go make the Facebook post that's going to get you that inbound warm lead.  Be willing to go grab lunch with somebody, again, not every time.  It shouldn't be part of your ongoing process, but guys, be willing to do unconventional,  unscalable things to scale, okay?  That's how you scale.  That's how you pick up momentum is you do those things, those hustle deals.  Guys, 2025, that's what I'm all about, is getting those hustle deals and getting back  to the freaking, the nitty gritty basics and I hope you guys will too.  So guys, appreciate you being on this call.  I'm going to upload this, the replay, here in the next few minutes and I will see you  guys next week.  Guys, bring your questions, anything at all that you've got.  Maybe next week we'll have a topic specific Q&A and we will see you guys in a week.  Thanks, guys.",

If you, if I'm selling to you, and you kind of give me some bullshit about you want to think  about it, I'm just going to go ahead and tell you that I've already thought about it for you.  And if, and this is how I phrase it, guys, this is exactly how I do it. I'm not,  I am very blunt, but I say to you this, Mr. Business Owner,  respectfully, because I do enough of these, because I'm literally, we're trying to go across  the nation within, in the best cities possible, it makes zero sense for me. If I let you think  about it, and I let everyone else on my calendar think about it, by Wednesday, I'm going to have  to follow up with 10 people. And all I'm going to do is spend my time following up. And then I got  to hop back on the call with you if you decide to do it. And then we got to go through the onboarding  and the whole deal. So I'm just going to, like a couple of years ago, what I did is I made a  commitment. I do not do, I want to think about it. I have sent you five leads. You have closed  X amount of dollars if they've closed, right? You already are sold on advertising because you  were paying for XYZ service. You already told me you hate that service. You already told me you  want to grow. You know I can bring the heat. You've already seen some of my testimonials.  And I review all the objections I've overcome. If after all of that, because I know that the  last company sure didn't give you free leads, if after all of that, you're not a yes, and it's a  still I want to think about it, this ain't a good fit. This is not a good fit. And I don't want you  to take this wrong. And I'm not trying to burn a bridge. I don't burn a bridge. But this is not a  good fit. I need partners that want to grow. I need partners that are hungry. I need somebody  that wants to go freaking tear someone's throat off and go take over a city and take over a state.  So if this makes sense, let's rock and roll. If it doesn't, then we're not doing the I want  to think about it. You want to do this or not? And then what I'll say is I'll go like,  look, Sam, look, Carl, you and I both know this is the right move. Let's freaking do this deal,  man. Amex or Visa. Let me take the card. Grab my pen. Boom, baby. Right back for the close.",

    "pageContent": " For sure. We got some good questions. So Matthew says, is it viable to try and snatch a few leads  from FBA groups to use also to close deals before ads take off? I remember you did talk  about this. It's pretty hit or miss, but can work. Francesca, what are your thoughts on it?  Did you know what he's asking? You cut out the first half. Is it viable to take,  go into Facebook groups, grab a few free leads and use those to go hook a deal and  get the process going while you're waiting for ads?  Can you repeat it? Sorry. No, you're good. So like, and the, like Facebook groups,  people ask for recommendations like, Hey, who has a local concrete guy, right? Can we use those  leads, those interested people as a form of free leads on our end to give to business owners  while we're waiting for ads to take off or even to supplement them to get the deal?  I think so. Yeah. Nick, you did a live on this or YouTube video like last year.  The only thing I like to use Facebook group leads to pick up the slack. I don't like to use  them to start a deal. Sometimes I'll use them to hook a deal to test the market. I don't love,  once I know the market's good to use them, because then if my ads don't kick in, it's like,  I don't have a predictable way to continually just scrape leads. But if I'm running ads and  my ads slow down, it's a great way to go get like some sweat equity deals and go get some  leads that way. So my opinion is hook them, use those leads to get interest, to gauge interest,  to call around, to get somebody on the hook if you need to, if you want to do that without  setting up ads. But I like to have my leads coming in from ads and then use those as a supplement  rather than my main thing, because I don't, I can't predict when people are going to ask  for recommendations, right? So that's just my two cents, but leads are leads guys. It's about  strategy versus tactic. The strategy is giving free leads in advance. The tactic that we're using  is Google ads. But guess what? If you guys can, if somebody in this group can come up with a  predictable, you know, repeatable way to glean and harvest leads out of Facebook groups forever,  and we don't have to run ads, go ahead and hit me up on DMs. And we'll go ahead and implement  that and stop running ads, but ads is just the most predictable thing.",

    "pageContent": " All right. So I'm having a tough time figuring out if I'm picking the right keywords. So I just  went back to the keywords that you created. Okay. So I'm doing like a ton of analysis. Maybe I'm  doing too much. I'm analyzing like 26 keywords because I wrote it. I'm a programmer. So I wrote  an app to do all this for me. I'm not doing it manually. So I'm running like 26 keywords per city  and that's the screenshots I put in. So am I doing too much? Like how do I know  if those cities I pasted in are actually good? Yeah, I think you're doing too much. I mean,  look, I think people like you, I swear to you, and I mean this as a compliment, you guys are too  smart. The reason why this model works really well for people like me is because I'm like, all right,  I don't even have the patience to do more than like five or seven. I don't think you need more  than five or seven keywords to analyze a city. Okay. All right. So the second part was...  Let me say one last thing. So like tree service, I know that the lists are in here. I can share  those too. And guys, if you guys have lists or you've seen lists I've shared in the past,  that would be awesome for you guys to reshare those. I can also go and find them. But tree  service, you're looking at... Well, let's use concrete because it's just the one that was used.  So concrete is the core keyword. Then you got concrete contractors. I think concrete company,  concrete patio, concrete driveway, concrete sidewalk. There might be one more. I'm going  to use those keywords plus the city. And that's going to be enough for me to say yes or no on a  city.",

    "pageContent": " So, what do you do when the customer objects?  You go through the whole thing, you do the Amex or Visa, you do the Assumption close  and the customer says they want to think about it, the customer has to talk to their business  partner, the customer this, the customer that, they got to check their budget, whatever.  We should know what the objections are gonna be and you're probably going, oh crap, I forgot  to hit on that one or I didn't hit on it hard enough and you're gonna know exactly what  you did wrong in that moment.  What do you do?  Okay, well first of all, what you don't do is you don't give up because 99% of sales  people are taught that this is where the deal starts, right?  You got the grant card notes out there, this is where the deal starts, this is the objections,  right?  And it's like, kind of true, but I'm a big believer in just overcoming the objection.  However, you are gonna have times where you forget, you are gonna have times where you  don't do it correctly, you are gonna have times where you've done it so many times you get  lazy and you forget to do, to overcome the objection beforehand.  You forgot to check if they watched the screencast.  You are going to have to deal with objections.  The cool part is because we've focused so much on the setup, the objections are gonna  be minimal.  We're not gonna have to dig through a treasure trove of objections to close this thing, okay?  So I'm gonna do a very basic training on how to handle objections, which we will do more  in-depth training later, but I want you guys to notice something.  Most sales trainings, they would spend majority of their time talking about this part, which  is the objection handling, but I've spent most of my time talking about the setup and  the close because you can just overcome it all there, okay?  However, I do know this happens.  It even happens with me from time to time and it's usually, well, it's not usually,  it is your fault.  You missed a step, okay?  But what do you do?  So I'm gonna go over a quick little training and the first thing that you wanna do is you  have to tie them down, okay?  And I have an entire video that we did, a live stream, and we'll try and link it up  or make it accessible, but we did this entire training on this concept, okay?  First thing that you need to do is you need to tie them down to that objection, okay?  Think of it as you're trying to get them into a corner so you can kill them, right?  Which I know is a little aggressive or a better example maybe of not using something so extreme  is all of the, you're in a house and you want to keep all the air in the house, right?  And every window that's open is an objection.  And in order for you to close the sale, you need to get all the windows closed, right?  And every window is an objection, so you're just going through closed, closed, closed,  closed, but you need to find out which windows are closed and which windows are open.  So first thing you need to do is you need to tie them down.  So here's what I would do is if they say I need to talk to, or let's use a different  example.  That one rarely should come up because you should make sure that the business owner's  partners are on the phone or that they're the decision maker.  That shouldn't come up.  But let's say that they object and",

    "pageContent": "say they wanna think about it, which is pretty common,  let me mull this over, let me get back to you.  That's a really common objection.  So here's what you're gonna do is you're gonna say, yeah, and you're gonna say, you're gonna  agree first.  You're gonna go, yeah, I feel you, man, I totally get it.  And you're gonna tie them down.  You're gonna go, so let me just ask you this and then, this will be really quick, let me  just ask you this and then we'll hop off, because I don't want them to feel like we're  getting into battle mode, right?  So I'll say, besides just thinking about it, is there any other questions, does anything  else, besides just like the fact of thinking about it, anything else that doesn't make  sense, like assuming you think about it and it makes sense, like is there any other reason  that you wouldn't wanna move forward with this today, okay?  And you have to tie them down.  Because if you don't, then there could be multiple objections.  This could be what they call a smoke screen.  It's not the real objection, right?  So what you're gonna find is when you say that, sometimes they'll go, well, I mean,  I need to think about it, but also I need to check with my partner.  And you go, oh, I forgot that one too.  So now you got two.  So okay, all right, so besides thinking about it and besides talking to your partner, is  there any other reason or any other question of why this wouldn't make sense today, why  you wouldn't wanna move forward today?  Nope, that's it, okay?  And now you can start digging in.  But what we've done is we've taken all that list of objections and we've eliminated all  the other ones and we've narrowed it down to one or two, okay?  So in this example, I'm gonna just share if you've got one objection, because if you guys  are doing this correctly, you should have no objections and if you miss a step, you  should have only one.  But I'm gonna just assume this person just wants to think about it, okay?  And so then what you're gonna wanna do is dig in a little bit and be like, so if you  don't mind me asking, what exactly do you wanna think about?  Because to me, everything sounds like it makes sense.  And listen, okay?  Don't let it sound salesy, don't put pressure, but listen to what they say.  What exactly do you wanna think about, okay?  And they're gonna tell you, they're gonna say.  And then you're gonna listen and look at cues and try to pick up on what they're actually  saying, not just the words that are coming out of their mouth, okay?  So you're gonna tie it down.  You're gonna ask a follow-up question or two about that objection.  Maybe it's a spouse.  Okay, what exactly do you need to talk to your partner about, right?  Do you need his blessing, her blessing?  Is he the actual decision-maker?  Am I talking to the wrong person?  You can do a little pride game there.  Dig into it, okay?  And then you're gonna use the magic feel felt found, okay?  It's a three-step process.  So as I said before, we want to agree.  So they're gonna say, yeah, I just wanna make sure that this is the right decision, right?  Because it's like 2,000 bucks, I just wanna make sure",

Just say, I feel you.  Just let them know you understand.  Then what you're gonna do is you're gonna use an example, and this is why it's really  important to have a bunch of examples in your back pocket, which we'll get into later.  You're gonna use an example of one of your clients, okay?  And this could be one of my clients, one of somebody else's clients, or one of your own  clients, and that's why you need to have a pocketbook full of these, a Rolodex full of  these.  You're gonna say, funny that you say that, do you remember that guy Brooks that I was  showing you earlier, the Bentonville Concord guy?  Yeah, I remember him.  Okay, he, when we talked, and again, this has been a couple years ago, he felt the exact  same way.  We talked, and everything looked right, and he's just like, dude, I just want to think  about it.  So, just so you know, I'm with you, okay?  So Phil felt, right?  Brooks, it's way different than if you say, yeah, man, I get you.  I felt the same way, blank, right?  You, of course you felt the same way, and you're gonna try and convince them, but when  it's Brooks, when it's the client, it's totally different, it's a third party, right?  So yeah, you remember Brooks, yeah, he felt the exact same way.  That comes to step three, which is what he found, so you're gonna go, yeah, but after  we talked about it, and I asked him, Brooks, what do you want to think about, what he found,  or what he realized, doesn't need to be those exact words, but what he realized is that  he was already paying for Google Ads, he wanted exclusive leads, he was tired of the leads  being pimped out, and that there was really no risk, because even if I only, if I just  sent him 10 leads, or 12 leads, he was gonna at the very least double his money.  And so, what he ended up doing, he's like, dude, really it's just me being, like, putting  off the inevitable, so let's do it.  So Brian, you know this makes sense, you've seen the case studies, you already told me  that I'm not full of crap, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, let's do the deal, man.  Are you an Amex or Visa?  Let's quit messing around, okay?  And you're gonna go back for the close, okay?  I know that might sound scary, but you know what's more scary is being broke.  You know what's more scary is getting off the call and missing out on a $2,000 per month  deal, a $24,000 per year deal that you could have gotten by just saying one line that was  a little bit uncomfortable for you in that moment.  And I understand, I'm not that aggressive, but I get it, I get it, but guess what, get  used to being uncomfortable once in a while, because you're gonna have to get uncomfortable  to be comfortable.  You know what's comfortable is using that $2,000 to sip my ties on the beach in Mexico  and have people rub cocoa butter on your belly while you're",

    "pageContent": " Alright, now that we have the frame and we added the content, we interlinked everything,  we are going to do the on-page SEO.  Let's start with the page title.  So the page title is, I have our Bentonville Concrete website up here.  The page title is what comes up when you hover at the very top of the website.  So we like to keep the page title between 50 to 60 characters and to add that on Weebly,  so we select, we're going to do this for every page except for the contact as page.  We are going to do it but it's not going to be to SEO because the contact page, we don't  really care for the ranking as much as the other pages, we don't add content, it's just  a way for people to submit a form.  So you're going to click on pages, you're going to click on the home one, right here  under and don't get it confused with the page name, that's just the home, go into SEO settings  and up here in the page title, we usually like to do service comma service comma location.  So for our website it would be, and again you can pick the keywords that are most representing  of your business, the ones that rank the most are the ones with the most volume in search  that you probably want to have for the home page.  So concrete contractors and then concrete, we could even do company, Queen Creek is a  pretty long location, so let's see if, and then make sure you add the state, let's copy  this and ward counter, okay, we usually use the wardcounter.net, it's pretty easy, okay  Okay, we're 55 characters, so we're good, and then let's do the ones for the other service  pages, I have a stamped concrete right here, so obviously the page title for that is going  to be stamped concrete, stamped concrete, we can do like decorative concrete, you want  to really pay attention to how you're spelling things, make sure you're putting everything  in the word counter too, to make sure you're not going over 60 characters, let's do concrete  driveway, let me see what we did here, okay, I'm actually just going to put it in here  so I don't have to copy and paste it, so let's do concrete driveway, concrete dollars, okay,  that works, let's copy and paste it, pretty easy, especially once you have your keyword  extended and you know exactly what you want to target, and then let's do concrete patio,  the first keyword should be fairly simple, if it is too long for the location and you  don't fit two keywords, just pick one keyword if that's the case, it's always better to  do less than to go over, okay, so could do walkway or sidewalk, really again just look  at your keyword list and the ones with the highest volume that are related to the content  that you're going to add to the page is what you want to put, so definitely if you have  a homepage for concrete patio, you definitely want to put concrete patio in the page title,  and then the second keyword I would probably do whatever it is that has a high search and  you're going to talk about in that page, concrete patio, and make sure you publish, you need to  publish everything, and then for the contact page we usually like to keep it simple, so I would  probably just put contact, Queen Creek, concrete, and then make sure you publish, save everything,  and you're done.",

Okay, first of all, most people,  when they train you sales,  no matter what sales training you go into,  no matter who you talk to,  most people just train you to wait for the objection  and then how to overcome that objection  or how to try to overcome that objection.  For example, when the customer says,  I wanna think about it, you say this.  When the customer says I need to talk to my spouse,  you say that, okay?  And that's exactly how I was trained.  But I realized that they're testing  a couple of different things  and just trial and error,  that the times when I brought up the objection first,  it always seemed to be a non-objection  when I got to the closing table, okay?  And I learned this very early on.  And so I wanna relate this to,  if you have kids or just think back to when you were a kid,  and I'm guessing this is probably the situation.  But for me, for example, if my kid does something stupid,  first of all, I'm gonna be mad no matter what, right?  But if I find out from their own mouth,  they come to me and say, hey dad, look man,  I broke the iPad, I'm gonna be ticked, right?  But I'm gonna be a lot less ticked  than if I just find a broken iPad lying on the ground.  So it's the same exact thing.  We know the objections are gonna come  and we're never gonna be able to avoid them,  whether it's now, whether it's later,  the objections will always come.  So why don't we just go and meet the objection?  Why don't we just offensively go meet the objection,  overcome them all in the setup phase  so that we don't have to deal with objections?  That's an interesting way to think about it, right?  And so I've heard something along the lines of,  and I've heard this from multiple people,  it's like the better your questions are,  the better the results that you're gonna get.  Something, I think I know I butchered that,  but whatever, you get the point, right?  And so instead of asking how do I overcome  I wanna think about it,  let's start asking how do we just avoid objections  or how do we just not have objections  during the Zoom close?  Well, I found a way and that is  we're gonna meet the objections head on  and we're gonna overcome them before they even come up.  So the setup, just to define it,  is the period from the moment you call and do the hook  until the moment you jump on the Zoom close  and do the close, okay?  During that entire period, that is the setup.  So guys, the close should and actually does happen  during the setup for a couple of reasons, okay?  And it should happen for a couple of reasons  during this period.  Number one is that it's not expected.  Everyone expects you to get on the Zoom close  and to have your spiel and get to the end  and do the hard close and have all these sales techniques,  but what they don't expect is to be closed  during these initial calls.  They don't expect to be closed during that initial hook.  They don't expect to be closed during a screencast.  They don't even know what a screencast is, right?  So they definitely don't expect it.  So number one is they don't expect  to be closed during this",

    "pageContent": "period.  The next thing is the business owner has their guard down  during this period, okay?  When they get on the Zoom close, make no mistake,  they're expecting to be sold,  they're expecting to be pitched something,  but during this phase, they're really open,  they're casual, they just don't expect it.  They're watching a screencast  and they're not expecting to be closed, okay?  And so without them even knowing,  we are overcoming objections in our conversations  on the phone and our text messages during our screencast,  they don't even realize it, okay?  And the last thing is what I love about this,  and this is why the deal should be closed during this phase,  is this is gonna take the pressure off of that last call.  That last call should be enjoyable.  Last call should be quick and easy and breezy,  and it should just be a matter of you getting  the credit card and you guys getting excited  about working together, okay?  So it's going to take the pressure  off of that big, scary, hard close,  and that is why it should be,  that is why the close should happen during the setup.  The objective of the setup, very, very, very simple, okay?  The objective is one thing, and that is to overcome  all the objections that you could potentially have  or that you know you will potentially have during this step.  And then we're gonna do it strategically,  we're gonna do it so it just makes sense,  there's no pressure, that's it.  The objective of this step is that we are going  to overcome all the objections offensively,  or what they used to teach me this word,  I don't even know if this is a word,  but we used to use the word preemptively,  meaning before it actually comes up.  The goal, the objective, is very simple.  Overcome the objections before they ever become objections.",

I know I had this site in New York,  some cities like Rochester had a tree service site. I found out pretty quickly that they just  shut it down for the winter. Just shut it down. In fact, what they do is in the winter, they actually  just do snow plowing. They do snow removal. They don't even do tree service. They're like,  yeah, we're shutting it down November 15th and we're going to do snow plowing. We'll call you  in March. No and ifs or buts about it. They just don't do it. I still do the same niches.

You are more than welcome to use Twilio or whatever other software you want to use.  That's fine.  I'm just showing you what we currently use for our company.  So once you make an account, very easy, you just put in your email and password.  You can actually also log in through Google.  So you're going to click on this, my account, and I believe it says E because it's evergreen.  So whatever your company's name will have that letter up here.  And then you're going to click on account settings down here under manage.  Click under all companies and you're going to create a company.  So each tracking number will have its own company and that's because let's say you  need to make a quick website for that same company.  We want everything to be very organized and under the same thing, it's very easy to search  as well.  And so we're going to create company right here.  You put the company name.  I actually made a mistake earlier.  It's called Queen Creek, not Queens Creek.  So let me just edit that up here as well.  Just really quick.  Okay.  Back to CarRail.  So actually taking that out.  So it's just going to be like the website title, city and service time zone.  This will be the same time zone as the location that you're targeting on the website.  In my case, Arizona, you're going to put the primary company phone number.  What that means is where do you want the calls coming to your website directed to?  So it will be probably the client's phone number or the secretary, whoever is scheduling  the leads phone number.  I'm just going to put a random one, okay, add users.  This is where you can actually add different users to be able to check the reporting.  CarRail also allows you to listen to the recording calls.  And then once you add it, you can create an account user that is your client if he does  like to listen to the recordings.  So you can get pretty creative here.  And then you're just going to click on create company and go to company dashboard.  CarRail will automatically take you here.  Okay.  So let's select the company that we just created, which is Queen Creek Concrete here.  Oops.  It's the other one.  We already had one.  We do like to add the state as well.  I just didn't want to create a duplicate, so that's why I didn't put it.  But usually you want to put the state as well, just so you know.  And then you're going to create number, click, I'll use it offline.  Same thing as before.  It should automatically pull whatever number you put earlier.  This is the phone number that the calls will be redirected to, number setup.  So you want to do a specific area code.  And how I picked this, I actually just Google Queen Creek, Arizona concrete, kind of like  if you were doing a due diligence and I like to see what the area codes of the main businesses  are.  It looks like it's a, this one is tricky because they're all different.  Looks like it's either 480, 480 looks like the most common one.  And then what I like to do is just stick that out and put area code because we want to look,  we want the website to look to the customers like we own the company and we're a local  one.  So 480.  So after that, you're just going to go back to Carl, type 480, which is the area code ",

So you're going to copy, search for Google and search for all the numbers and pick the  one that looks the last, the least scammy.  And this is going to be a little tricky, but we like to make sure that we pick a number  that is going to be good for our website.  So search Google.  Okay.  Now we have all four numbers and what I mean with scammy is once you search for all four,  so this one only comes up with few, once we search it, this one looks good.  We definitely, so this one for, this is a good example.  See how this one says escort Phoenix.  We definitely don't want people to think we're associated with that.  So that phone number we're going to scratch off.  Scam alert, definitely not that one.  Some life mates.  Yeah, we probably want to go with this one.  Looks the least complicated.  So the one that ends in 2455 and then again, make sure you do this, especially for the  actual website that is going to be your asset.  And then we are going to name this Queen Creek, just like the company.  Make sure you add the state.  I know I didn't do it for the company, but that's just because we didn't want to duplicate  and you're going to add the service number features.  Make sure you add a whisper message.  The whisper message is up to you.  What the whisper message is when let's say I find the website, I need a concrete driveway.  I call your client will pick up the lead and we'll receive a whisper message before the  lead talks.  So the client knows that that's a lead that came from you.  And so we can put something like new lead from Queen Creek concrete.  So the client knows, okay, this is a lead that Nick sent me or whatever.  And then make sure you click on call recording because we want to record every call that  came through and boom, you're done.  So it's right here.  This is your tracking number that we're going to use for the website.  And then this is the phone number you're going to forward the calls.  If you ever need to change it in the future, just click on this pencil right here.  You click on the pencil again up here and you're going to be able to change who the  numbers are being forwarded to.  You can change the whisper message, you can change everything and then just make sure  you click save and you're done.",

What is in it for them and what is in it for you?  And as I've talked about already, the more important part of this equation, which is  what's in it for the business owner and what's in it for you, it's way more, although it  sounds counterintuitive, it's way more important for you to explain to them clearly what's  in it for you than what's in it for them, because they already know what's in it for  them.  Okay.  They're already expecting you to shower them with reasons why it's a good deal for them.  But very, very few people, in fact, no one explains what's in it for the person calling.  So for example, home advisor, all they do is they call and they say, hey, you're going  to get, I'm going to give you leads, blah, blah, blah.  They don't turn around and say, hey, the reason that we're doing this is because we make a  shitload of money off of selling leads.  Okay.  Because guess what?  If they did that, they'd sell a whole lot more leads if they just said that.  But instead it's always like, oh no, we're just such good people.  And guys, that's the same reason you guys have been on calls with me.  That's the same reason why I tell you, hey, I'm going to take care of you.  I am going to over deliver.  I know you're expecting me to say that, but guess what?  Here's what's in it for me.  If I over deliver, I am going to grow this group and I am going to make a lot of money.  And I have no shame in talking about it.  I got no bones saying that.  Okay.  And when I say that, you respect it.  You're like, okay, that's what I thought anyway.  I'm glad he owns it.  Okay.  So I just wanted to point that out.  Do not be shy telling them, hey, this is what's in it for me.  Okay.  This do not, do not be shy.  Do not feel like you need to lie.  Do not feel like you need to hide.  Do not feel like you need to pretend to be a good person or that you're just helping  out.  I like to help local business owners.  Bullshit.  Okay.  Bullshit.  You're here to make money.  They don't know.  They already know you're going to do that.  Okay.  I just want to point that out.  Let's dive in.  So guys, going back a little bit, the last thing that we did before we transitioned is  we explained, Mr. Business Owner, Jack, the reason I called you is because I saw you're  running paid ads on Google.  So I know you're hungry to grow.  Now we transition and we're going to transition.  The first thing we're going to do is we're going to tell them that we have a hot lead  for them and that we want to give them a couple leads in exchange for a conversation.  Okay.  Yeah.  So Jack, I'm merging these a little bit, but we get done.  Hey, the reason I'm calling you is because you're running ads.  So here's the deal is the reason I'm calling you, you know how I mentioned Silver Beach  Circle?  Yeah.  I have a lady.  Her name is Janet.  She needs a tree removed.",

Okay.  Make no mistake about it.  I would like to give you this one, but I'd also like to give you about three to five  of these to just test out.  All I would ask in return, and the reason I'd be willing to do that is I would love  to talk about possibly working together in a couple of days or maybe a week, whenever  I can get you a couple of jobs.  Would you be open to that?  If I could just give you a couple for no charge and then we talk in a couple of days.  Okay.  Guys, that's all you got to say.  That's the whole step.  That's the deal.  You're going to get a couple of jobs.  First of all, I have a hot lead.  That's why I'm calling you, just to follow up from last step.  Okay.  And I would like to give you three to five for free.  That's what's in it for you.  What's in it for me is I want a conversation.  Are you good if we have a conversation?  Because here's the deal.  You're already spending money.  You're hungry to grow.  I have jobs.  I don't do the work.  You do the work and you need more jobs or you wouldn't be running ads.  So what if I get you a couple for free to prove that I'm not messing around and we talk  in a couple of days?  Okay.  No obligation, no commitment.  The only thing I ask in return is that you talk, is that we have a discussion.  That's it.  Are you good with that?  Cool.  And guys, that's it.  That is it.  And I don't even want to go any further.  Some other things that you can sprinkle in is I do at times, if I'm feeling a little  shaky or I'm a little bit more comfortable, I do like to sprinkle in, I like to name drop.  So let's say I'm targeting St. George.  So at this point, I would be like, maybe they'd say, yeah, I'm down.  I'm cool.  Cause like guys, that's a really, it's a, it's a, it's a no lose.  There's no risk for them, right?  The only risk is if you start saying, oh, it's good, good, good, and you don't explain  what's in it for you, they're going to say, yeah, I'm good because they just think it's  a scam.  Okay.  That's going to translate the scam.  They think it's a scam is going to translate into I'm good or I've got plenty of work.  They're really actually interested because they're running ads.  They just don't understand.  Okay.  At this point, if I'm feeling a little shaky, what I'll say is, Hey, do you guys know the,  you know, XYZ company down the road?  It's totally different.  These guys actually do, they do, they do tree service.  You guys know them?  Yeah.  So yeah.  Tony's a great guy.  Michelle's awesome.  Yeah.  I've been",

So if it's somebody in their town, if I'm already working with somebody in St. George  or in Austin or whatever, I'll use, even if it's a different industry, I'll use somebody.  If it's somebody in the industry, I'll just drop the name.  So let's say I'm going, I'm in St. George and I'm targeting a company in Vegas or I'm  targeting company in Vegas, but I have somebody in St. George in Vegas.  I'd say, Hey, I know this is a little bit of a stretch, but you don't happen to know  that company up in St. George, a couple hours wait, it's called Provent.  I know that they've like done a few jobs down there.  Have you bumped into them?  Okay, cool.  Anyway, the guy's name is Joe.  I've been working with him doing something similar, not in your market, but in St. George  for about two years.  It's been awesome, man.  We've been working together forever.  So anyway, beside the point, and that's just a way of me building credibility.  Okay, guys, that's it.  That's the deal.  Again, most important part about explaining the deal is first of all, don't overthink  it.  Just explain.  I'm going to give you a couple of leads.  First of all, I got Janet.  She's hot, baby.  She's ready to roll.  Number one, you're going to explain that.  You're going to say, let me give you a couple for free.  Like literally, the only thing I ask in return is I want to have a conversation.  That's it.  I want to have a conversation about possibly working together.  That's it.  Explain it.  Then again, we're going to transition after this point if they've agreed and said, yeah,  that sounds good.  I'm okay with that.  Say, oh, awesome.  What's the best email and phone number to send these leads to?  I'm just going to go right into it.  What's the best email and phone number to send these leads to?  Because if you ask that question and they're not following you, they ain't going to give  you the email.  They're not going to give you the phone number.  Okay?

I remember a couple months ago, I had somebody I was talking to  and we dug in, we dug in, we dug in and I found out pretty early on that they were like,  I want to blow up my business because, and this is a real story, because I'm so tired of my sister  not believing in me and every time I go home, she's talking crap about me and saying I'm not  going to make it and I'm on to the next thing and I'm so tired of that and I was able to find that  up front and at the end when there was like, oh, I don't know if this is worth it, whatever,  I reminded this person, I said, dude, how many more family dinners are you going to go to  and have your sister laugh at you? How many more family dinners are you going to go to or Christmas  get togethers you're going to go to where you're the laughing stock of the family, right?  And I knew that's what drove that person and I was able to hit on that and at the end,  and it was like, yeah, you're right, let's do this, let's freaking do this. So the most important part  of the entire script is figuring out what drives them, period, right? Because if you've done the  lead part correctly and sent the leads, you've done most of the selling already. If you've overcome  the objections beforehand like you should have, I mean, that is most important is figure out what  drives them, figure out why they're in business and then you can always at the end, that can be  your thing that you use to close. And guys, do not hop off the phone with a maybe. Somebody  tells you they'll call you back, say, hey, sir, ma'am, I appreciate you, but if it's a maybe,  that's a no for me, okay? I need somebody now. I need somebody that can commit and if this isn't  100%, after I've sent you three to five leads, after you've made money on my lead, if that's the  case, after I've shown you that I'm going to give you these exclusively, I've shown you how I got  the lead, we've spent a couple hours on the phone. If this still is a no-brainer and look at the  numbers that we talked about on the lead value calculator, if it's still not a no-brainer, it's  a no. Because what you're telling me is you are not confident in your ability to close and that is  not somebody I can work with. So if this makes sense, which I think it does and you know it does,  let's do this right now. If it doesn't, then let's know, but I don't do call me back later,  shit. That's not how we roll. You want to do that with the Dish Network guy, that's fine.  The carpet cleaner guy, that's fine. I work with one company and of course, this is going to be  in your own tone. This isn't the douchebag",

    "pageContent": " [\"Take Me By Your Side\"]  Guys, it's time to freaking close the deal, baby.  And everything, again, I've said this on the last video,  I've said this multiple times,  everything that we are doing up until this point  is leading us to this moment, okay?  And that's not to psych you out,  that's not to spook you out,  that's not to overthink it or get nervous  or get sweaty palms.  Guys, if you've done this correctly,  I need you to also remember as serious as this moment is,  if you've done this correctly,  this should be a piece of cake.  There should be very little apprehension,  very little in terms of objections and all that kind of stuff.  You're just gonna be relaxed, but be in the moment, okay?  I'm excited, I love this part.  This is literally what I live for.  And I will tell you that back  when I first started doing sales,  this part freaked me out  because I knew that I was going into a bloodbath  and they were gonna object  and I was gonna have to say these things  I didn't wanna say and all this stuff.  Well, guess what?  We do the setup correctly  so that we don't have to go through that, okay?  So one thing I want to mention really quick  before we hop over to the closing script  which we're gonna go through  is I wanna talk really quickly about rapport.  So as soon as the customer jumps onto the Zoom,  it's fine to spend a few minutes just like,  hey, how's it going?  Or maybe they have something on the wall  and you ask them a question.  But guys, I used to think like when I first started,  I heard about rapport  and I thought you needed to talk about fly fishing  or guns or trucks, golf, something like that  for 30 minutes to build rapport, okay?  And I realized that's not what rapport is.  Rapport is showing the customer  that you know what they're,  first of all, you care.  First of all, or second of all,  that you have what they need.  Third of all, you know what the hell you're talking about.  And fourth of all, that you know how to get them a result  and you are there for business, okay?  Above all, it's showing them that you're professional  and you mean business and you don't need to be rude.  You don't need to cut them off,  but you do not need to spend 30 minutes  talking about fly fishing or generators or food storage  or whatever weird thing they're into  that you can make a connection.  I know that people think that sales, it's not.  Sales is getting in saying, hey, look, Mr. Business Owner,  I wanna respect your time.  I wanna respect my own time  and I wanna get into this, let's go, okay?  They're gonna go, oh shit, this guy means business.  This lady, she means business and let's go, okay?  So don't feel like you need to do that.  I do occasionally, you'll notice in some of the videos  that I've shared or that I will share,  I'll see something, an African painting and go,  hey, just so you know, where are you from?  Okay, cool, I actually lived in Africa.  I make a connection, but it's not necessary  and I don't dwell on it, okay?  So let's hop over to the closing script.  Okay, guys, we are at the FFM Closing Script 2.0. ",

    "pageContent": "I'm actually really excited to say that this has changed.  So when we filmed module one live back in December of 2021,  we had a different script.  Now, it's very similar, but we have,  or when I say we, I have gone in, I have looked at this,  basically what was happening is I realized it was too long  and I was like, look, we gotta figure out a way  to shorten this up, this is taking way too long.  So I basically said, I'm gonna test this out  and I started doing the script,  but I started pulling chunks of it out, okay?  And I started testing it.  And after about a month of having the exact same result  and closing at a really high rate,  I realized I could remove a bunch of the script.  So if you guys have 1.0, you're gonna see  that there's stuff that's taken out of it  that I think that it was unnecessary, okay?  So this is the latest, the greatest, the leanest,  and I'm trying to continue to shorten this  because I don't think it needs to be super long, okay?  But what I wanna do here is I just wanna go through it.  I'm gonna have, and as you guys have seen,  I have tons of examples of me doing this live.  The best way to give you this example  and showing you how I do this is give you live sales calls.  And so I'm gonna continue to do that.  So I wanna just go through this step by step, okay?  So here at the top, I just have a couple of reminders.  I would recommend printing this and putting it off,  putting it on your desk and studying this thing  over and over and over because if you can learn this  like the back of your hand, you're not gonna have  to refer to it over and over.  And by the way, I will tell you that there are students,  I've watched some of your recordings of your first deals  and I have literally watched,  you look at the business owner over here  and read the script over here and still close the deal.  Like word for word, read the script.  So if you feel at any point you don't know what to say,  just go back to the script, okay?  It is very, very effective and very, very good.  Okay, I'm excited about this guys  and I do wanna say one last thing, not to toot my own horn,  but this is not a script that I Googled,  this is not a script I borrowed and built on.  I built this from scratch and I built this from scratch  based on the experiences that I've had,  based on thousands and thousands,  sitting at thousands and thousands of kitchen tables,  sitting on thousands, well not thousands,  probably hundreds of Zoom calls, soon to be thousands,  maybe we're close to thousands,  but this is a script that I've built,  tweaked, tested, torn apart, put back together.  It has been refined and refined  and will continue to be refined.  It is a living, breathing document and it works.  And I'm proud of that, but I want you to know  this is not a script that I pulled and said,  let me just tweak it.  No, this is from scratch.  I pulled open a document and I said,  all right, let's start building this out.  And it was a blank canvas and this is the masterpiece  and it works, okay?  So also note, this is the same script I used  when I launched this program to get the first 30 of you  to join the program. ",

So if you wanna talk about being sold on your product,  you wanna talk about a product that works,  you wanna talk about drinking the Kool-Aid,  I'm drinking my Kool-Aid,  because I'm literally using the script  to get you into the program that I'm actually selling you on.  So work that one through your head.  All right, let's go into this.  First thing that I do, I got a little asterisk here,  I wanna keep this video condensed, so let's go into it.  First thing I do, I take the pressure off,  I let them know, hey, I'm not the hard close guy,  I'm just looking to see if this is a fit, okay?  That is literally it and I let them know,  I'm like, hey, I don't have a big spiel for you,  even though secretly I kinda do.  I'm like, hey, I don't have a big spiel.  So just take the pressure off.  The less pressure they feel,  the better chance you have of closing it, okay?  And then I talk first about the purpose of the call.  So some points that you can choose to hit on  and you'll notice in my calls, sometimes I hit on them,  sometimes I don't, but I try my best to do it is,  some of the things I cover is, hey, look,  I'm not looking to do this for the next few months,  I'm not looking for a one month deal,  I'm trying to figure out if I can work with you  for the next 10 years.  I can make you money, you can make me money  and we can have a symbiotic relationship for 10 years.  So I'm looking to make sure this is a good fit, okay?  Just so you know.  And then I'll tell them, hey, my objective is to figure out  where you're at and you guys probably remember  some of this stuff when I was talking to you  because my objective is to find out where you're at today  and where you wanna go, okay?  And if my product, my leads can help you get  to where you wanna go from where you're at fast,  then we got a really interesting conversation  we're probably gonna be able to make something work.  And if it doesn't, Mr. Business Owner, I will tell you,  I will be the first to end this call and I'll end it early  because the time is the one thing that we can't get back,  okay?  Also, I put, here this kind of go in with that last point,  if my exclusive concrete leads help you achieve that goal,  that's the same thing, okay?  It's just kind of tied in.  Boom.  And then I also will sometimes hit on this a lot  and I'll say, hey, look, and I told some of you guys this,  if this isn't a good fit, I'm not gonna push it  because I'm not interested in trying to sell you  every single month on why you should stay with me,  why you should be with me.  I want somebody that's in this for the long run  and I wanna make a lot of money together, okay?  And then this is very, very important.  My only ask, this is why I put it in italics, okay?  And you can say some version of this.  Don't put pressure, but say something to this extent  is",

All I ask is that at the end of this, if this is a fit,  let's rock and roll, let's shake and bake, let's do this.  I truly believe money loves speed.  I might even be wearing a sweater.  So all I ask, if this makes sense, let's do it.  Let's not hobnob around and you leave me in I don't know zone.  That's the only thing I ask, okay?  And also, if it's not a fit, just tell me straight up,  I'm a big boy, I'm a big girl,  you're not gonna make me lose sleep.  That's my only ask.  We on the same page, okay?  That's basically me saying, hey, look, bro, look, lady.  All I ask is that you give me a yes, no at the end of this,  but I'm saying it in a little bit different way  so I'm not adding the pressure, okay?  So first thing after you kind of set the stage  is I wanna learn about their company.  Guys, get interested in this part, enjoy this part.  Get a piece of paper, get a pen.  I have a yellow notepad sitting there in my remarkable.  And I literally, I tell them, I say,  I wanna learn just a little bit.  I wanna ask you a couple questions  to figure out where you're currently at.  And these are the questions I'll ask.  I'll be like, hey, and I'll tell them,  hey, I don't wanna be weird, I don't wanna be intrusive.  I wanna know these things  because I wanna find out where you're at  and then where you wanna go.  So just so you know, I'm not trying to peek  into your life too much, but it does matter to me  because I wanna see if I can help you, okay?  So some of the stuff I will ask them, what's your, hey,  so tell me, how much revenue did you do last year, right?  How much, how much, okay?  And I'll say, so okay, cool, you did a mill last year.  What do you wanna do this year, okay?  And then I'll ask them like, how does,  so like, how does your business make money?  Like tell me, I know you're in concrete.  Do you do more of the commercial jobs?  Do you do more of the residential?  How are you currently getting your business?  Like all of those things, I just wanna find  as much information as I can  so that I can figure out if I can actually help them.  Because if they start telling me, hey,  all we're looking to do is get commercial jobs.  First of all, I should already know this by now  and that's probably not a good fit  because most of these leads aren't commercial.  But if they sit there and go, hey,  we're plenty good on residential.  We only want commercial.  I'm gonna tell them, hey, just to be honest with you,  Mr. Business Owner, Mrs. Business Owner,  most of these jobs, 75% of them are gonna be residential.  So if that's gonna be an issue, I'm not gonna lie to you  and tell you they're all gonna be commercial.  There are gonna be some, but I don't wanna waste your time.  A lot of this is gonna be residential.  However, I will tell you this.  When you have",

Having too many leads is not actually a bad thing, okay?  I also ask them, what's the end goal?  And again, guys, my biggest thing with this  is because you can add questions,  you can take questions away,  find out what makes them tick  and what's important to them.  And they're gonna give you,  this is a really important question  because they're gonna give you some bullshit answer  and say, well, I wanna make $2 million a month, right?  I wanna get the five million, okay, cool.  Why?  And Mr. Business Owner, I don't want you to feel  like I'm being that just weird,  but why do you wanna get there?  What is it actually?  You wanna get the five million, why?  Because do you wanna be, is it a recognition thing?  Do you wanna prove somebody wrong?  Do you have a vendetta for somebody?  Is it your old boss?  Or do you wanna go golf?  Do you wanna go and spend more time with your family?  Do you wanna be able to start other businesses?  They love talking about this stuff  and it's really interesting if you actually care  to find out.  And you guys know, I ask you the same thing.  I'm like, hey, what do you wanna do?  Okay, I wanna get to 10K, I wanna get to 50K.  Cool, cool story, bro.  Why do you really wanna get to 50K?  What do you wanna do?  Is it just one big F you to the world  that you just wanna prove everyone wrong  and get a chip on your shoulder?  If so, awesome, tell me about it.  I'm right there with you, man, and that's the truth.  Do you wanna go play golf?  Do you wanna be Tim Ferriss and go sip my ties on the beach  and have people rub lotion on your belly?  I'm cool with that, just tell me about it.  Like, I wanna be able to help you get there, okay?  And ask them and really, really care.  And it's important that you dig into their why, okay?  Now, you don't need to go so deep  that it feels like you're doing a therapy session,  but I want, get them to start talking real with you, okay?  Get them to start sharing something  other than I wanna get to 5 million.  That's like, oh, that's such a surface level goal.  Guess what?  I wanna get to a million a month.  I wanna get to 10 million a month, okay?  But it's so much deeper than that,  and I've told you guys, I wanna get those moments  where I set these goals that I never thought I could hit  and I hit them.  I want a Rolodex of exhausted but satisfied moments.  I know what my thing is.  I know what my why is, so it'd be really easy to answer.  A lot of these guys don't know, or a lot of these girls,  you gotta dig in, okay?  So, once we've gathered all that, say awesome.  And then what we're gonna do  is we're gonna start sharing the screen,  but I put right here, preface the pitch, okay?  So I share the screen and I don't share it until now  because maybe you have the script pulled up or whatever.  Make sure everything's clean and go,  okay, hold on one",

So, first thing you're gonna do is you're gonna go,  just so you're aware, our objective is we go into markets  that are low-hanging fruit.  Essentially, the reason I got ahold of you  and the reason we're targeting Queen Creek  is because there's a lot of people looking for concrete  and there's not a lot of competitors  because everybody wants to go after Phoenix.  So we have this really cool opportunity.  That's why I'm calling you, just so you know.  I don't call everybody.  I'm not calling somebody in Mesa  and somebody in Glendale and somebody here and there.  I'm looking at Queen Creek  and I'm gonna work with one person exclusively  because there is an opportunity  that either you're gonna take or somebody else is gonna take  and I'm excited about it, okay?  So you're gonna preface it and you're gonna tell them,  just to be candid with you, as I told you before,  I've been reaching out to the best companies  that look like the best fit  and we wanna work exclusively with one company.  Again, you're planting these seeds, right?  You wanna let them know you work exclusively, okay?  All right, one thing I did note here as a reminder  is the sell through the client.  So, and I'm gonna talk about that in greater detail.  We have live streams that we've done on this concept  but anyway, you're gonna wanna sell through the clients  and instead of it being like, oh, if they ask a question,  instead of you handling it saying, oh yeah,  here's the answer, you're gonna go, hey, great question.  That's exactly what my client Joe in St. George  had the exact same question and here's what he discovered.  Remember that?  He also felt found and also selling through the clients.  Sorry about that, guys.  Anyway, so let's keep going, okay?  So the first thing, once I share the screen,  I'm like, all right, so let me show you something  and I come over here and I reemphasize  the market monopoly strategy.  Keep in mind, we have already shared this to some extent  in our pre-closed screencast.  So this is just reminding them, keeping it top of mind, okay?  One thing I totally left out and I, by the way,  I want this, like this is just how it is.  I kind of spaced it.  I want to make sure you guys remember.  Don't forget at the very first of the call  to make sure they watch the screencast, okay, that you sent  because if they haven't watched it,  and you should know because you should have tracked it,  but double check and make sure they watched it  because if not, that was a waste of time, okay?  And you're gonna have to overcome a lot of objections  that should have been covered in that, okay?  So first thing I do is I show them something like this.  I explain the monopoly strategy, okay?  And I don't need to go into too much detail.  You guys know what that is.  Basically more digital properties equals more money  is that's winning the game, okay?  And I'll show an example site.  So here I'm like, look, I work with a company  called Montgomery Construction.  As you can see, they're actually not even ranked,  but luckily I've been able to rank",

So I've been able to capture three  of the top 10 organic spots plus one map listing,  three in total.  So I'm almost banging down 33% of all the real estate  on page one.  That is why I'm winning, okay?  So I covered the market monopoly strategy.  I show an example.  And then you can also show, just really briefly go,  hey, and just to give you an idea of what this looks like  once we get to page one, this is the leads from June, okay?  And I'm not even gonna sit here and sometimes I will.  I'll go one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,  nine, 10, and I'll go 11, 12, 13, 14.  You get the point, right?  There's a lot of leads coming in and it is only,  it's not even through the end of the month, okay?  So I'll show them those three things.  I'll show them the example,  I'll show them the Bentonville concrete example,  and then I'll show them the leads if you have them.  Guys, you don't have to show the leads  if you don't have them, okay?  Don't worry about that, okay?  So market monopoly strategy,  and then I mean, I go really deep into that.  Like that is basically it.  So I'm gonna show them that,  I'm gonna show them the site,  and then I'm gonna show them the leads, okay?  And then what I ask them is a really important question.  I say, hey, do you have any questions  about like how this works, anything like that  before we go into price, okay?  Or cost, whatever.  And they might, and this is where they might ask a question  and it might give you some insight  into what they're thinking, okay?  And then what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna explain  and I'm gonna go, hey, like the video  that I sent you yesterday,  so just real quick to understand  why we structure this how we do.  We don't do commission or paper lead.  And I'm sure you can understand,  commission does not make sense, period.  Like we just don't do it.  And just cut it off, say it bluntly,  we do not do commission, never have.  Doesn't make sense, you have no skin in the game,  I have no incentive to get you leads.  It's a dumb model.  Now let me tell you, we used to do paper lead.  And let me tell you what happened, okay?  And I will share the example of the client that I had.  We started on paper lead, it was X amount per month.  I thought it was gonna be the sky's the limit.  Ended up that it wasn't.  They ended up canceling or they ended up bickering  and trying to beat me down on price  and this lead and that lead.  It just didn't work out.  So here's why we do what's called flat fee, okay?  And we put it on a pedestal and we explain it, okay?  And flat fee is the best.  And guys, you need to get sold on the fact  this is the best case scenario for you, of course,  because of the cards on file, but for them as well.  Because when your site does rank  and they go from 12 to 15 leads to 30,  are",

Okay, then what we're gonna do is we're gonna open up  the lead value calculator, okay?  And if you don't know or if you wanna wait,  you've done this a few times,  you can go ahead and put their numbers in here.  But I've already done that.  So we're gonna open this up  and we're gonna walk them through it, okay?  And explain that the price that we're gonna charge  or we're about to drop,  it is not based on how I'm feeling right now.  It's not based on what I think you can afford.  It's based on a mathematical equation, okay?  And so here's what we're gonna say.  So I put, explain the goal.  Sorry, explain that the goal is to come up with a price  that even with the worst case scenario,  Mr. Business Owner,  even if that worst case scenario happens,  you're still gonna make money, okay?  And explain that to them.  So to explain, hey, what if we do a deal  and there's, whatever, something crazy happens  and the leads are a little bit slow  and we only get you 10 to 12 leads per month.  That's what I'm basing the price off of.  I'm not basing it off of what if I do  what I did in Bentonville Concrete,  which is probably pretty likely, okay?  So explain that this price is based on worst case scenario  and then you're going to put the number in.  Say, hey, look, what I did is I calculated  and I said, what happens if I only get you 12 leads, right?  Well, based on these numbers right here,  even if I get you 12 leads,  Mr. Business Owner, Mrs. Business Owner,  you're gonna make $18,000 in gross profit per month, okay?  With 12 and I just showed you what's possible, okay?  And again, I don't even wanna do that  because some of you guys are gonna go,  oh, I don't have leads.  I'm showing them the leads and what's possible  because I have it, but if you don't have it,  you don't need to show them that, okay?  You don't need to worry about that.  And so, and say, Mr. Business Owner, Mrs. Business Owner,  at that price, or sorry, at 12 leads, only 12 leads,  you're still looking at $3,600 in net profit, okay?  And then what you're gonna do is you're gonna drop price.  You're gonna come over here  and you're gonna go, based on the numbers,  the price is $2,000 per month,  which we either do monthly or we do weekly,  and then, or you can insert price,  and here's the cool part, you get 100% of the leads.  You get 100% and they're all exclusive, okay?  You get 100% of the leads, they're all exclusive,  and then I put, just so you know,  it is gonna be a little bit slower in December  because of Christmas, okay?  This is me overcoming a future objection.  It is gonna be a little bit slower  because of Christmas in December, but guess what?  In the spring and in the fall, sometimes in the winter,  you're gonna see a huge uptick in leads,  and I'm not gonna come banging on your door  asking you for more money.  All I ask is",

    "pageContent": "don't call me on Christmas and bug me  because it is gonna slow down a little bit,  but that's the beauty of the flat fee, okay?  Okay, last thing is explain  that you have a six-month agreement.  So I say, so it's really simple.  Like I said, it's only 2,000 bucks per month,  or you can do it weekly at 400 bucks a week,  sorry, 500 bucks a week, and what we typically do  is I don't like to start with some two,  even a year contract.  I like to start with something that's at least long enough  to give this thing a fair shake,  but it's not so long that either of us feel tied in  because who knows, maybe in a few months  I find someone I wanna work with better.  Maybe you don't like the way I work  and I don't wanna be tied in forever.  However, I do need you to commit  to at least some period of time  because look, I'm committing to you  to be 100% exclusive, so it makes no sense  for you to be able to walk away at any time  because I'm not going and building other relationships.  I'm not talking to other business owners.  I'm married to you, and I need you to be married to me  at least while we're working together.  So what we do is a six-month deal.  At the end of the six months,  my intention is that we roll this into another year,  but at the end of the six months,  if you don't like it, it's no problem, okay?  That's how I explain the contract.  And guys, do not hesitate to bring up contract.  Do not be scared to bring up contract.  Do not bring it up timidly.  If you bring it up timidly, they're going to see that,  they're gonna sense it, and they're gonna exploit it, okay?  They're gonna say, yeah, hell yeah, I have a contract.  Like, what do you think this is, okay?  Like, that's the mentality.  Yeah, of course I have a contract.  I'm gonna be exclusive with you.  What do you expect, right?  That I'm exclusive with you, but you have no,  like, you can walk away at any time.  That makes no sense, okay?  No sense at all, okay?  Anyway, just explain that you have a contract,  and then here's what I do,  is I explain everything one more time that comes with it.  So we drop the price, okay?  So if you guys notice,  this is what we call a shit sandwich.  At the beginning, we're talking about the case studies  and how good it is, that's the bun, right?  So we got the bun, that's the good,  this is the case studies,  this is all the leads that we've gotten,  here's the results, blah, blah, blah,  and then the shit, which is the price,  because as much as I don't wanna say it's the shit,  it's what they're gonna have to pay, right?  So that's the patty.  So you got the bun, which is good,  you got the shit, which is the price,  and then you wanna add a bun,  that's the shit sandwich, to complete it,  you wanna add the bun before you ask for price.  So what you're gonna do,  is you're gonna lay out everything that they get,  before you go for the close,  which I'm gonna save for the next video,  and I will see",

So at about the three quarter mark, so I'd say, let's see, in about 45 minutes, Aaron's  going to do a screenshot and anyone that's on this, just as a reminder, anybody that's  on this, this live stream till the end, we're automatically going to send you the digital  resource that we're going to create from this thing.  So you guys don't have to worry so much about taking notes.  I want you to just sit there.  I want you to take notes of the things that come to your mind, not the things that I'm  saying.  Because the things that I'm saying, we're going to send you guys in a digital resource.  I want you to take notes on the things that come to your mind, the ideas that are generated  from the things that I'm saying.  I think those are the most important things.  Excuse me.  And then Aaron's going to send you a digital resource that we create.  So that said, guys, yeah, appreciate you guys being on.  We're going to keep doing these.  I like doing these sessions much better because the people that are on these are serious.  They're trying to actually make moves.  They're actually trying to do something with the information.  And it's not just a consumption fest like it sometimes turns into in the free group.  So I, again, I don't care if there's three people on this call.  It looks like we have about 14 people on this call, which is great.  Ironically, that's about the same or more than we were getting, even when we were going  live inside of Facebook.  So anyway, welcome to the call.  Appreciate you guys being on here.  And I'm going to make this worth your time.  This isn't something that I'm just going to pull out of my head, even though I could,  because I've done this.  I've talked about this a million times.  But I took, you know, I think it took me about 45 minutes.  I got all my thoughts on the paper, put them in order, exactly the things I want to cover  and I'm going to go over that right now.  So, guys, today we're going to be talking about niches and seasonality.  And if you haven't noticed already, I'm really harping on the, you know, the niche and city  selection first.  And the reason why there's a million things we could talk about, we could talk about sales  and there's a trillion things inside of sales.  We could talk about, you know, hooking business on which is part of sales, we could talk about  building lists, we could talk about what else could, I mean, there's  so many different things we could talk about, you know, doing the actual technical stuff  on your agency, setting up the business, what type of business.  There's really, really unlimited topics for me to talk about.  But again, as I've repeated the last couple of weeks is if you don't nail this part correctly,  everything becomes tough.  Everything becomes very difficult.  And so I've commonly said inside of, inside of digital landlords, inside of the free group  is the money is made in the buy, not the sell.  Meaning if you don't pick the niche and city correctly, it doesn't matter how good you  are at sales.  It doesn't matter how good you are at SEO.  Everything becomes more difficult.  Your ads are more expensive.  It's harder to",

And on the flip side, if you've picked the right niche, you picked the right city, you  nail that.  Everything else becomes easy and easier.  I've had deals.  I specifically remember one, I didn't do so many due diligence worksheets, but I just  stumbled across a very, very, you know, I would say low hanging fruit is the term I  like to use something that, you know, there's high search volume.  It's a perfect niche.  It's also got a lot of, you know, it had, you know, very low competition.  I put up a website and it wasn't even something I was like, I didn't really have the bandwidth  to even build a website at that time, meaning I was so busy with other projects and pre-selling  and doing and trying to scale the specific niches.  But I just saw this, this opportunity and it was so good.  I was like, I'm a fool if I don't do this.  So I literally just went on, I bought the domain, I passed it over to my team, which  at the time consisted of like one person that I have hired in Africa, his name is Peter  and then Francesca.  And I said, Hey, can you just build this out?  Just get me like a thousand words on the homepage, 250 to 500 on the service pages, you know,  just the bare minimum.  Give me a tracking number and just like, I don't even want backlinks.  I don't want to worry about SEO, nothing.  I don't care about GMB, just get this thing live.  And I did this and I actually forgot about it.  I forgot about it for like six weeks and I was checking in with another client who I  had in mind when I built this because they had my site in the city next door within the  same niche.  And I went and reached, I just did like some basic stuff.  I cleared my search history and lo and behold, within six weeks, I was completely not just  on page one, but I was top two or three for every single search term.  And these are like the main key search terms in the city.  And I didn't do anything and I didn't even build the website completely how I like to  build it.  I usually like to do 2000 words on the homepage.  I like to do 500 to 1000 on the service pages.  H1 is done properly, H2 is done properly, the page titles, all that stuff.  We didn't really do it that great of a job, but because it was such a good opportunity,  I did nothing, just built the project, let it sit there, let it sizzle, let it simmer.  And I came back and in six weeks that thing was completely glued to the top.  So that is why I am such a big proponent and why I'm going to continually talk about the  city and niche combination, the due diligence.  And I know this is like the third week in a row that we've been talking about it with,  especially with this new format going into like really deep, nuanced stuff.  But this is important.  And like the topic today is we're going to talk about niches and seasonality.  And it may sound like something that you could cover in one sentence and I probably could.  However, at the same time, guys, I've lost thousands of dollars by not doing certain  things.  By the way, Aaron, there's somebody in the waiting room.  I don't know if you saw that.  And let me know if",

So today, guys, we're going to be talking about seasonality and niches.  For those of you that weren't on last week, for those of you that are maybe brand new  to the group, just a two second or maybe, I guess, 30 second brief on me is, you know,  obviously, my name is Nick.  I started the free group art of pre-selling or sorry, it was the art of pre-selling the  art of digital real estate.  I also started and run the group called Digital Landlords.  It's my paid community that I created from my experience in building and scaling a rank  and rent agency.  I've been doing this since 2016 with a tiny little, you know, shiny object, whatever in  there where I was gone for about nine months.  For the better part of eight years, I've been doing this.  I have lost millions, and I say millions, it's not just an arbitrary number, actually  multiple millions of dollars I have lost on building niches in the wrong cities, in the  wrong states, in the wrong building websites, sorry, in the wrong niches and cities, in  the wrong states.  I have lost money hiring the wrong people.  I've lost so much money on Google Ads.  And I've also made millions of dollars.  And over the last, since 2020, we have been doing at least seven figures and we're never  going to go back.  OK, so 2020, we finally figured out the missing pieces to this business model.  Many of you guys have probably heard of this business model, maybe in the past.  Build a website, rank it, go rent it out.  That's great.  There's missing pieces to it.  The due diligence process has to be perfect.  You have to consider the CPC.  You also need to realize if you want to scale this thing, you need to sell your website  first, get a client first, and then build a website on the back end, unless you have  unlimited time and unlimited money, you need to pre-sell and you need to flip this thing.  So I figured out all these missing pieces in 2020.  And in eight months, we went from eight to ten thousand dollars a month, with half of  that being SEO, to a hundred thousand dollars per month.  Eight months later, in July of 2020, a hundred percent lead generation, SEO was completely  separate.  I'd given that away and was taking a cut on it.  That was 2020.  In 2021, we did one point four or five million.  December 1st, 2021, after having so many different people hit me up with questions, hey, how  are you getting deals?  How are you selling?  How would blah, blah, blah.  I realized I needed to launch something and teach people how to do this the way that I  did.  The way that I did it that allowed me to scale.  So that said, that's kind of, I guess, would be what if you're sitting here going, why  the heck should I listen to this guy?  That's what I'm going to give you.  And at the same time, I want you to take everything that I'm giving you.  And I don't just want you to accept it.  I want you to think about it.  I want you to be intuitive about it.  And I want you to test it.  I don't want you to accept what",

So anything that I say is what I've done.  So that's a little bit of why I think it's worth your time to stay on this call, as well  as the fact for those of you that just joined at the end of this call, if you are still  on, we are going to send you a digital resource with notes.  Basically, it's going to look nice.  It's going to be a PDF.  You're going to be able to just, you know, quickly have all of the stuff that we cover  PDF.  And so that's kind of the deal.  So what the game plan is.  Hold on. Let's make sure we're muted here.  Yeah, so I just muted them.  No problem. Is there a setting you can just keep everyone auto muted when they join?  We'll check it out.  I'm trying to find it, but I'll just search it.  It's completely fine. And by the way, I do get it.  By the way, I've had this happen to me before.  So if that was you, it doesn't matter.  I just want to make sure that we can all get through this quick.  So here's kind of the outline of what I want to or I guess my promise to you on this  call is my goal for today's training over the next thirty nine.  Let's see, what is going to be forty five?  Yeah, forty four minutes is I want you guys to realize that things change  in this business as the seasons change.  OK, and there are certain things that you must do in order to protect yourself  against these changes.  And as well, I'm going to give you guys some tips for avoiding any issues  whatsoever that would normally arise as a result of the changing seasons.  Now, some of you guys are sitting here going, man, it's it's July, almost August.  We're still a couple of months away from, you know, winter, at least in the US.  And and by the way, if you're not in the US, then the same principles apply.  But your summer might be different than my summer.  Like I know in Australia, the summer I think is flipped.  Summer is during my winter in the US.  So just take the principles.  Don't necessarily, you know, go well on my summers at a different time.  Just take the principles that I'm teaching and then apply it to your situation.  I'm talking about it right now because this is something  that needs to be on your mind right now.  And it's going to affect the way you sell.  It's going to affect the niches that you go after, the cities that you go after,  the way that you do the deal, you structure the deal,  the things that you say to the business owner.  I know this sounds very nuanced and I don't want you guys to get overwhelmed.  But you need to understand that this is something I didn't know.  And two years in a row, it almost put me out of business  because I didn't understand this principle, OK,  which is that that niches have seasonality and it does matter.  OK, so the game plan for today's call is we're going to go as follows.  We're going to cover how the seasons affect this business.  What what you need to think about before selecting your niche,  which is going to be brief, because I've talked already about niches.  We're going to talk about what to consider when selecting",

And then if you're not in a city slash state in the US, in your country,  whatever city is in the country you're targeting, which, by the way,  this does work in other countries, for those of you that are wondering about that question.  We're going to talk about how to preemptively solve any problems  with the business owner that would normally come as a result of seasonality.  And then we're going to talk about how to make sure your contracts match the seasons.  OK, and then if we have time, we're going to do some Q&A.  So that said, guys, let's one more time, if you stay to the end,  we're going to get you that digital resource because we appreciate you  giving your time and I want you taking notes on the things that come to your mind.  Not what I'm covering, because I'm going to give you the notes  on what we're covering in the form of that digital resource if you stay to the end.  OK, so let's talk first about  how the seasons actually affect this business.  This is a fact. OK, lead flow changes with the seasons.  No matter what anyone tells you, no matter how much you want to pretend it doesn't.  Leads are different in the spring than they are the week of Christmas.  That's just a fact, right?  Because of a million different reasons we're going to talk about today.  But just so you know, leads are going to change.  The flow of leads, the amount of leads that come in in specific niches  does change with the seasons. OK, just so everybody knows.  Another fact, OK, most home service  businesses slow down during the holidays and during the winter,  which is basically when it gets cold.  Let me repeat that most home service businesses  slow down during the holidays and when it gets cold.  Now, obviously, there's going to be stuff in there that might be,  you know, a little bit flipped, for example,  when it goes from getting being really hot and your AC goes on to,  you know, it starts to get cold and you kick on your heater.  It starts to stink and smell.  And then all of a sudden, oh, my gosh, I need to come and check my whatever my my  what the heck is it called my not my thermostat, my unit  that, you know, that little period of change is going to get going to give a spike.  But just what you guys need to understand, the majority of the niches  that we talk about that we target that I've made my money on the concretes,  the tree service, the fencing, the the the epoxy.  All of these things are negatively affected during Christmas  and the cold when it gets cold.  OK, again, if you're if it gets cold at a different time of the year than December,  then you need to consider the fact that that might affect you twice,  because no matter what, when it's holidays, people typically  aren't doing stuff on their house.  OK, that's just that's just really the case.  OK, when the seasons change and I'm talking about, you know,  when things start to get cold, when the holidays start to come up,  you know, probably from Halloween.  I know that's not really a holiday, but from October 31st until.  Honestly, until after the New Year,  definitely through January and then about mid February.  People's desire to fix their houses is pretty much like going down,  and it is the slowest from December 15th to December 31st.  That is a fact, and I can prove that I could show you so",

People's desire to fix their homes, to do repairs,  to add concrete to whatever on their houses,  unless it's a complete emergency, like their tree is falling into their house.  It is going to be the slowest from December 15th to December 31st.  OK, and then for some weird reason at the first of the year,  even though it's still bloody cold, people like have some,  not all, but a lot of people, they have kind of like this like new,  hey, we're going to get things tightened up and we're going to do this.  That typically comes more during spring cleaning.  But you will see a little bit of an increase during the first of the year.  But I'm telling you, those last two weeks in December  are the slowest time of the year. OK.  I don't know other than the fact that when it's cold,  I don't think people are in the mood. They're not thinking about it.  But I also know that people are like they're out doing parties.  They're having parties at their house.  They're they're buying gifts for their kids.  They're traveling for for the holidays.  Money's not as expendable. Right.  And that's just a fact. OK.  Also note that like when the season starts to change from the cold  back to the warm, the spring, the spring cleaning itch, people,  there's a there's an uptick.  There's a really nice uptick in Leeds.  And hey, let's come in, you know, get our trees trimmed  and get that taken care of. Let's throw in that fence.  Let's get that artificial grass put in that we were talking about last fall.  We don't want to put it in during the winter.  Let's put it in.  We're not even able to use it during the winter.  Let's put it in now that the snow's starting to melt.  Or if it doesn't snow now that it's starting to get warm, we can go out by the pool.  Let's throw in that fire pit.  Let's do that outdoor kitchen or whatever the case is.  As the season starts to change to warmer weather  based on the niches that we target and talk about basic home service niches,  you are going to see an uptick. OK.  And one of the things I want to add just as something to remember  is there is a strong correlation.  And I know this because I've I've heard people say it is when tax returns  start to come back to people, you start to see an uptick as well.  OK, people get their check, especially like obviously W-2.  They go if you're on a W-2, you go and you submit your taxes  and then you get your return, whatever.  A lot of people take that money and they put it into fixing up their house.  You know, pressure washing the the the entire house.  Epoxying the garage, whatever the case is.  And these are things that I have not just heard is or not.  This isn't data points.  This is from experience.  I have seen it, guys, my first two years in business.  OK, like actual because I did it the first year.  I got sidetracked, whatever.  So 2017, I would say my first three.  Let me not even lie to you guys.  My first three years, 17, I basically only had SEO clients  because I was trying to like just make money to pay the bills.

    "pageContent": "SEO because I just need to pay the bills.  18 and 19, I got wrecked during the holidays.  I got absolutely wrecked.  And what happened to me is in 2018,  the biggest time I got wrecked was in 19  because 18 something happened that kind of like confused me.  And I thought that, you know, I was safe.  But the mistake that I made, guys, is and this is another reason  I could sit here and talk about this all day long.  But another one of the 50 reasons  why you should be doing flat fee regeneration and not paper  lead or commission deals or, you know, profit splitting is for me.  What ended up happening is a lot of my deals were on paper  lead back in 2018, 2019.  I thought that was the holy grail of of how to structure this business.  OK, and what ended up happening is I had like some pretty solid months,  July, August, September, even October.  And in 2018, November, go figure,  was, I think, my biggest month of the year.  And what had happened is I was in a specific industry  that, you know, was affected by weather.  And the industry was basement waterproofing.  OK, and what happened is in October, I believe it was maybe September.  I happen to have sites in states that got hit by hurricanes.  Yeah, I think it's called hurricanes or typhoons.  I think it's hurricanes anyway. Yeah.  So what happened is September, October, these storms came in,  completely wiped out houses and flooded basements and all this stuff.  And so it took a while for the insurance people to come out  and, you know, quote them whatever to clean up.  And November was phenomenal for me.  I mean, we had so many leads.  And at the time, I was getting paid per lead.  So I thought I'd figured out the game.  Huge November.  I'm trying to make my projections based on like October was good.  September was good. October was better.  November is amazing.  And I'm like, dude, this is it's just going to get better.  And then December 2018, we literally just completely craft the bet.  I mean, our revenue went to like 25 percent  because all of our deals, for the most part, were on paper lead.  So if no leads come in, no revenue comes in.  Imagine, right, like all of my employees I've got.  I've got an office space.  I've got, you know, vacation I've budgeted for.  I got Christmas coming up.  I've got all these different things I want to do.  And I'm on a paper lead model.  And all the leads that were good during November.  Now people are pausing because it's the holidays.  OK, even though they need to fix it, they're going to wait until the spring.  And guys, I got absolutely wrecked that that December, like absolutely wrecked.  I remember I was like nervous, like this is not good.  I was worried about my business.  I was worried about having to let people go.  I was worried about the fact that I had a lease on a rent payment on an office.  I was worried about buying.  I mean, everything was terrible.  It was just so terrible because I couldn't really control it.  OK, and because I'm an idiot, the next year, 2019, I all of 2019,  I continue to do paper lead for the most part.  Hey, it's just I was like, yeah, it's just because the",

    "pageContent": "niche, right?  It's just because I was in basement, waterproof and I need to go.  So I did paper lead, but I did it in different niches.  Started expanding into foundation repair and a few different things.  Lo and behold, same exact thing happened to me in 2019.  And this time it happened to me starting from end of October, November and December.  So I had like a two and a half month just tank and it was bad.  And if you guys remember my story, which I shared a little bit of at the beginning,  2019, December was kind of my like, all right,  draw a line in the sand or get out of this business, figure out,  are you going to go all in on this or are you not going to go all in on this?  But here's here's your moment.  And so I want to go like the reason I'm harping on this today, guys,  is because I have literally had some really depressing  November, December's and enough that it  it really, really made me like question this business model.  And it wasn't because of the business model is because I was an idiot  and I was structuring it incorrectly.  So if you haven't heard any of my content or me talk about paper lead,  go to YouTube, type in paper lead, Nick Wood, paper  lead, digital real estate, whatever you're going to see my videos.  I am not a fan of paper lead for those reasons. OK.  So just so you guys know, there is seasonality to this business.  You are going to continue to get leads throughout the year to some degree.  Now, if you're in snow removal, probably going to get zero leads in July,  except for maybe somebody looking for a job.  But if you're in like just a regular service, tree service,  concrete, spray foam insulation, artificial grass, fencing, masonry,  you're going to get some leads during the slow time,  but it's going to be drastically different. OK.  So that is what I want to talk about in terms of like, just so you know,  you need to be aware, you can pretend it's not the case.  But the seasons do affect this business.  They do affect this business.  But I have a solution for you.  I'm going to get you there in just a second. OK.  You also want to talk about next is you guys need to consider this  when you're selecting your niche. OK.  So what I would recommend is just everything is going to be seasonal  to some degree, no matter what.  Everything is going to be some degree of seasonality.  You know, concrete is going to be slower in December.  That's just a fact.  Concrete is going to be slower in November than it is in in in, you know, April.  That's a fact.  You're not going to be able to completely avoid seasonality.  But what I would recommend is don't pick something that is the best  or is good just during the winter like snow removal,  like and by the way, I've done I didn't do snow removal  because I was smart enough that snow removal didn't make sense to me.  But I thought, you know what, it'd be interesting.  I should do a website for Christmas lights.  You know, Christmas light installation.  And I did it.  I can't remember if I even landed a deal  or if I was just sending over so I did get leads.  Of course, I built a site, got it right, got some leads.  Might even have the website.  In fact, let me check.  Be hilarious if I do. Let",

Hang tight, is that me?  Oh, I do have it, huh?  I do have it, and I am ranked.  Number two, hilarious.  I don't even know if we got any leads last year.  I'm sure we did, but we don't even have a client for it.  Like, it's just a website that's ranked.  So I said not to get rid of it, I'm sure.  Christmas lights is good in end of November.  If you're in Utah, by the way,  people start hanging Christmas lights  the second the Thanksgiving's over.  In fact, Thanksgiving weekend, end of November and December.  That's it. After that, it's done.  OK, now I know there's some permanent Christmas light  businesses popping up, whatever.  I think it looks tacky.  Maybe it's just the company that's in my neighborhood.  I don't like it.  But I'm telling you guys, if you do Christmas lights,  if you do snow removal, it's going to be good for like two months, three months.  And then the rest of the year, there's no leads coming in.  So you can't expect that person.  It's going to be really tough to convince them, hey,  you're going to pay me this amount through the whole year,  but you're only going to get leads for two months.  That's really, really difficult.  So just my two cents.  I'm not interested in those niches.  I'm not interested in niches that are snow removal,  Christmas lights, stuff that only makes sense  during a very specific time of the year.  So the niche does matter.  Now, I'm not going to spend a ton of time because we've talked a lot about niches.  But just so you're aware, I'm not a fan of those niches  because there's not that much of a runway for you to get leads. OK.  OK, let's talk really quick about what to consider when selecting a city.  Just want to make, like I said before,  every city in the world is going to be affected to some degree  or another by seasonality.  You cannot avoid it.  But what I would just suggest really briefly on this topic  is try to avoid cities where it is extreme.  If there is extreme weather, I would avoid it because and it's not  that it's not going to work. It's not that you.  Oh, my gosh, I have a friend.  He's got some websites in that and he's doing.  That's great. It can work.  But it comes back to like, why make it harder on yourself if you don't have to?  If I can build for the same amount of money,  I can build a concrete website in Naples, Florida,  where the weather is moderate to good all year.  Concrete can be poured all year.  Or I could do it in Minneapolis, where it gets super cold.  Or, you know, Sioux Falls.  I think that's one of the Dakotas.  I think that just came out of my mouth.  Why on earth would I spend the same exact time  when I could get the say I could I could spend the same time  and have one that's going to be producing year round?  It just it doesn't make sense.  Now, if you live in Minneapolis,  then you might have an argument, hey, I have contacts here and that's whatever. ",

    "pageContent": "That's great. But if you're just living outside of these states,  do not try and target extreme freaking cities in the same way that I recommend.  I tell you guys, don't target California.  You can. But why?  Why are you making it harder on yourself?  Like, let's do the easiest thing we can do.  I'm lazy, guys. I'm going to be honest.  I want to do the most bare minimum thing I can do and make the most amount of money.  I'll put in the work.  But sometimes because we're willing to do the hard work,  we don't use our heads and we end up doing so much more work  than we need to do to get the same result. Right.  It's like I'm willing to go knock doors.  I did it for four years. I made good money.  I made a couple hundred grand a year.  I mean, from eighty thousand dollars my lowest year to two hundred and ten  thousand dollars in a four month, five month summer knocking doors.  Yes, I'm willing to do the hard work.  But then one day I was like, why the heck am I not using the Internet?  Why the heck am I using my time and trading my time for dollars?  Why don't I put the same energy and effort?  It's going to be my same 40 hour, 60 hour, 100 hour week.  Why don't I put it into something where I can use the Internet?  And now I can go and get deals without having to knock on a door.  And that's when I got into this. And guess what?  I'm putting in actually less work than I was,  way less mental and physical labor than I was when I was doing door knocking.  And I'm making millions of dollars a year versus a couple hundred  thousand dollars a year.  That was guaranteed because I was good at it and knew what to do.  But this I had leverage.  And so my point being, guys, I've done it.  I've tried the Dakotas. I've tried the Minnesotas.  I've tried these extreme.  I've tried the New York.  I have a website in Rochester.  I don't know if it's still a website, by the way.  The reason I don't know why some of these are alive  is because Francesca runs my agency, most most of my agency.  We meet. She updates me.  She gives I give her feedback.  Here's what we should do. Here's where we should focus.  Here's the guy that wants leads.  But she runs it.  I don't even know if we still have this website,  but we got this deal one time in Rochester, New York.  And I think we just targeted the area like idiots  because I wasn't thinking about seasonality.  And I think it was was it concrete, I believe.  And I went did my process, built a one pager, ran ads, got leads.  Boom, boom, boom. Sold somebody.  OK, a thousand bucks a month at minimum.  And I remember this because I very rarely do deals under a thousand.  Got the deal. And lo and behold, as soon as it got cold,  dudes calling me up, hey, we're we're not doing any more work until like January.  And I was like, what do you mean?  He's like, no, we actually like don't we don't we just don't even do it.  We just shut it down from now.  And he's like from about like he was like, whatever.  I think it was October.  It's like from mid November or end of November till February",

And so I there's nothing I could do.  I just had to like say, all right, well, I guess we'll talk in in March.  Right. And I've already built the website.  I've already got the deal.  I've already put the money into it.  So I'm trying to get you guys to just not make these mistakes that I made.  OK, there we go.  OK, now this is the good stuff.  This is the meat and potatoes.  What I want to talk about today.  There is always going to be seasonality.  You're going to deal with it.  It's part of the business.  It's part of every business.  I don't care what it is.  Retail is the opposite.  Right. Retail is the opposite.  They love Christmas.  Right. They love November, Black Friday,  because that's when everyone's buying Christmas.  Right. For us, we don't like Christmas because it's slow,  which I actually do love Christmas because it's when I take the time  to to put my foot on the gas and slash travel  because it does get a little bit slower.  But guys, this is the part I want to talk about, which is how to  how to preemptively solve any potential issues with the business owner.  Issues that normally would come as a result of seasonality.  You and I'm going to say this first.  I promise you they're going to come.  These issues are going to arise.  I don't care how cool your business owner is.  I don't care how long you know each other.  You guys went to high school.  If your buddy's paying you a thousand bucks a month  and you send him zero leads in November and December, it ain't going to fly.  I don't care how. Again, I don't care if it's your brother.  That might be different.  Maybe your brother is allergic to money,  but there is going to be an issue. OK.  So you know there's going to be an issue.  You know it's going to be a thing.  So what I always say in terms of this, I cover this in depth  inside of Digital Landlords.  Anyone that's on this call, I know Lane is.  He's inside Digital Landlords.  I talk very much about, you know, a lot of people say eliminate objections.  OK. I'm sorry. A lot of people say overcome objections.  And I like to say eliminate objections.  Overcoming an objection means that there's an objection that's presented.  And now you need to overcome it.  And what I found is that when you do that, you are on the defense  and you waited until they've presented an objection.  And now you have to overcome it. They voiced it.  It's a thing. They made it a thing. Now you have to overcome it.  On the flip side, if you know it's going to come and you bring it up first  and we call this preemptive, preemptively overcoming objections,  we bring it up first.  It is so much easier. OK.  And think about for those of you guys that have kids  or those of you guys have nieces or nephews or siblings, whatever.  It's like, for example, if you sit down and you're at dinner  and you tell the kids, you're like, look, if you finish this meal,  if you finish",

    "pageContent": "10 bites, right, because with kids, it's bites  because they don't finish anything that's healthy.  If you will have five bites of your chicken,  then you're going to be able to have ice cream.  OK. And you just lay it out up front.  As the food's getting put, you get five bites.  You can have ice cream. OK.  Now, they still might throw a fit. It still might be a thing.  But compare that to when you just don't say anything.  You put the food down, they start making whatever their style.  And then somebody at the table is like, oh, do we have ice?  What's for dessert?  And the kid hears it. Ha ha.  Good luck trying to convince them to have five bites, right?  Because you didn't bring it up first.  And now it's a thing. Now it's an actual thing.  OK, that's one example.  Another example I'll give you is when I started my digital  landlords program back in 2021 December at that time, which, by the way,  thank goodness, this has kind of gone away at that time.  Google was really funny about suspending.  This does happen still.  And so I'll even say it on this call for those of you  that aren't in there yet.  Google was very fussy about suspending people on their accounts.  And you would have to verify your account.  They would spend your Google ad account for all kinds of different reasons.  Credit card didn't match.  You were too new to the gate.  No one even knew the answer.  OK, like everyone got suspended, including myself.  It's like they updated this thing and everybody started getting suspended  and everybody started freaking out.  I figured out how to get out of it.  And so I realized like there's a pretty damn good chance.  And this isn't necessarily as much the case now.  It's gotten a lot better.  But it was then when I first started, almost everybody was getting  suspended at some point.  And so what I ended up doing, I took the same principle  and I told Kyle when he started working with me and helping on board people,  I said, every single time you talk about Google ads,  I need you to let people know it's not an if, but it's a win.  When your ad account gets suspended, here's what you're going to do.  You're not going to freak out.  You're going to reach out to this person and we're going to.  Here's the steps. And it's going to take time.  Sometimes it takes 24 hours.  Sometimes it takes two weeks.  You can't control it. It's just going to happen because it did.  And that was like 80 percent of people were getting suspended, including me.  I got suspended and it was kind of a pain, whatever.  But I figured out how to get out of it.  As soon as we started doing that, guess what happened?  When people got the suspension, their posts, their messages went like,  oh, finally got suspended.  What's the next step? Or finally got suspended.  What can anyone offer?  Instead of, oh, my gosh, I got suspended, I got  and just freaking out.  If you bring it up first, it is not a thing.  If you don't bring it up first, it is a thing.  Last example I'll give you, because this is such an important thing.  If there's if there's an objection that keeps coming up, OK,  just start eliminating it.  I don't care if it's price, if it's contract,",

    "pageContent": " if you keep seeing the same objection, start bringing it up.  I used to be terrified of flying.  I used to think that like I was going to die in an airplane crash.  Who knows? Maybe I will.  And honestly, I hope that I'm at least over a cool country,  like in like a jungle somewhere, not just over like stupid, like, I don't know.  Whatever was Lane said, frickin Joplin, Missouri.  Imagine I'd much rather die in like some jungle where a predator could eat me.  But I used to be terrified of flying.  I thought that was going to be the end of my life.  Whatever I thought about a lot.  And it would freak me out.  I swear to you, I had a couple of weird experiences  where like we had some really bad turbulence.  I'm like, dude, I'm going down.  Maybe you can relate. Maybe not. OK.  Some of you guys probably just have a few shots and you just sleep.  And that's the solution.  So anyway, this was the thing.  Like it would like consume my mind.  I would be like terrified, honestly, of upcoming flights.  And I remember getting on one flight has come back from Africa  and we were in New York  and there was a huge storm that like shut down the airport.  I was even more terrified.  Also, the like four days before that, there was a flight in Ethiopia  that like took off five minutes later, completely crashed.  Everyone on board died.  And by the way, it was the same exact plane as the one I was taking,  because I checked and I was like, oh, that's perfect. OK.  But this flight attendant or this pilot, I can't remember which one it was.  They got on the intercom.  They said, hey, look, we're in New York.  There's a storm.  You know, if we do a direct shot from New York to Vegas, there's a storm.  It's it's going to be rough.  So we're actually going to go down.  I think we went all the way down to like  Alabama or something to kind of go around the storm.  He's like, and just so you know, at about this point,  there is going to be turbulence.  It's going to be bumpy because we're getting some drifts from the storm.  That's completely normal.  But we should be good by about whatever, Kansas.  I don't remember if that's might be off.  Maybe it's New Mexico.  But he came on the intercom and he said this.  And I was like, OK.  And lo and behold, you know, I watched the map.  We went down and there was some pretty  like decent turbulence, like enough that it would have scared  the living daylights out of me.  But because he had brought it up first, I didn't think it was just like, OK,  he told me it's going to happen.  He didn't freak out.  Whatever. And so the point is, guys, if you guys will start bringing up,  this is the same for any kind of objection.  But if you will start bringing up these objections,  if you will start preemptively seeing the complaints  and the objections of people bringing them up and just  not waiting for them to get said to you, but you go to them,  it's going to be so much easier for you to overcome  or for you to still get the deal despite these things. OK.  So here's an example of what I like to do.  And I like to just bring it up.  And typically I bring it up on my",

But this is one of the things that I'll say is, you know, near the end,  when I'm getting ready to close, I'll be like, you know, it's flat fee, whatever.  But just so you know, it's going to be completely transparent with you  because sometimes they'll ask a question, right?  Like, how many leads can we expect? Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And I'll say, look, Mr.  Business Hunter, let me be completely transparent with you.  There are going to be some months that are super slow, some some months  and some weeks that we're going to get no leads.  That's just the fact. Christmas.  Just go ahead and don't expect any leads.  Everyone is out drinking eggnog, whatever, spiked eggnog  and spending their money on whatever.  Like, just just go ahead and put it in your head.  You're not going to get any leads. That's just Christmas.  OK. And it's probably good timing because you're probably going to want to be  with your family anyway. But that is the truth.  It's going to be slow. OK.  No one's thinking no disrespect.  No one's thinking about putting up a fence during Christmas.  Todd, OK.  Not to say Todd's in here, but that's just a business on our example.  And then I'll say, but there's also going to be some months  that are going to be super busy like this.  You know, when people start getting their tax returns,  we're going to see a spike.  When it starts to get warm, you're going to start to see a spike.  But here's the deal. It's going to even out.  I'm not going to come and charge you extra money because we have a huge spike  in leads during tax returns or during the warm season or because of this  weather or that weather.  And on the flip side, you know, I'm not going to pause  payments or lower the price when it gets a little bit slow.  It all is going to even itself out.  So as long as we're on the same page,  I'm not going to do some kind of surge pricing like Uber does  just because we have a huge influx.  But you've got to be just just promise me you'll be patient with me  and not call and complain when things get a little bit slow,  because that's just going to be the case. OK, done.  That's all you've got to say.  Does that sound good, Mr.  Winsor? And if guys, if you say this two to three minute thing,  you are setting the expectation.  It takes literally 30 seconds to three minutes.  You could say that exact same thing.  I just said you saying that up front, being very clear,  very honest with them.  It is going to save you so many phone calls, so much heartache,  so many setbacks, so many.  I got to resell the deal to this person.  I got to find a new business owner.  It will save you so much in terms of resources, time, energy, money, etc.  If you don't, good luck, because you are going to get phone calls.  It takes you 30 seconds to three minutes.  If you do not, you are going to have a issue  because it's going to happen.  You're going to have things slow down.  So why not just bring",

    "pageContent": "it up first?  Now, for those of you that are on there like, oh, my gosh, I sold a business owner.  I didn't bring it up. What do I do?  Well, what you do is what I'm going to talk about  in my very last section of this training when we're talking about contracts.  But I just want to like emphasize to you guys that, you know, a lot of business,  a lot of like relationships is setting and managing expectations.  If a business owner is expecting that it's going to get slow in December.  It's not going to be a big deal.  If a business owner thinks it's going to be just great all year round.  It's going to be a thing. It's going to be a real thing.  You have to set the proper expectations and then manage those expectations.  And the other thing that happens, guys, I know when you when I say that,  you know, that line that I said, which is like, hey, just so you know,  it's going to be slow during Christmas.  I know in some of your minds, you might think that's going to hurt the deal.  But, you know, it's actually going to do the opposite because you being honest,  you, you know, painting this picture that's not 100 percent perfect  and making it seem real is going to create more trust with you.  And again, I've said this so many times, trust is the hardest objection to overcome.  And no deal is perfect.  No service is perfect. No business is perfect.  And so if you paint this picture of everything's going to be perfect  and the numbers are going to be great, you're going to make all this money.  It's going to sound too good to be true because it probably is.  So just know that when you say things like that and you don't just say,  yeah, it's going to be great and blah, blah, blah, and it should just be fine.  Just say it as it is, man.  It's probably going to be slow in the winter, dude.  That's just the truth. You know, that's just how it is.  So, you know, and if they start complaining, like, yeah, sure.  If you want me to, you know, if you want me to lower the price  during the winter, that's fine.  But when I I'm going to also charge you extra  when we start getting a surge in tax time and during the spring  and during, you know, the storms that increase.  So that's how I get around that.  OK, so just so you guys know, that's all you have to do is those two to three minutes.  Sometimes it can be 30 seconds.  And that will save you so much time.  OK, last thing I want to cover is how to make sure  that your contracts actually match the seasons.  OK, number one, I oh, by the way,  I know people that have that are in this game that don't do contracts.  And that's completely fine. That's their decision.  Contracts make me sleep at night.  Now, I have a whole thing.  I could go on because I'm going to say it, but contracts make me sleep.  And I have a contract on every single person I work with as much to set  expectations, just like I just said, as much to set expectations  as it is to actually legally bind them to the thing that we've agreed to.  OK, so number one, I always do contracts.  Number two, I always do a six month minimum contract if I can help.  But there are situations I'll do three months. OK.",

    "pageContent": " But I also have a rule with contracts is I never let a contract expire  in the winter. OK, so or as things are starting to dip.  So I'm never going to let a contract expire in November, as it's probably  going to be slower than October, which means we're going downhill.  And then even if I sign them, it's going to be tough  because then in December, it's just tough, guys.  So I never let a contract expire during the slowdown  or during the winter months. OK. Period. End of story.  So what I'll do like right now, six months from now, it's it's July.  This is putting us in like it's a perfect example.  If we had a contract, right, that was six months.  We're I think we're going to end in December.  Like we're going to literally end December 29th, which is terrible.  You're going to be in the in the worst two weeks of the year. OK.  You're going to be trying to get them to sign a new contract  coming off the worst month of the year, the slowest month of the year  for most businesses. Good luck. It's going to be tough.  It's going to be very, very it's going to be tough to even keep them,  much less get them to sign a contract.  So what I typically do is like from right now until we get to about October.  So I'd say from now, August through the end of September,  maybe even mid October, I am going to be selling a either a nine month  contract or a three month contract.  OK, because I would rather my contract go August, September, October  ends in October and then I sign them for another six months or a year,  ideally a year, or I go August, September, October, November,  December, January, February, March, April.  OK, that's nine months.  I'd way rather my contract end in April after tax returns,  spring cleaning is starting to get warm, etc.  Then I would in November, December, January, February.  Do not sign a contract that's going to expire in those months.  November, December, January, February.  Don't have to listen to me. Go test it. Good luck.  Now, here's what I'll say to wrap this up.  Those of you that have signed contracts didn't even think about it.  You sign a six month contract, it's ending in December.  Oh, my gosh, what am I going to do?  Or you somehow signed one and then they wouldn't agree to an extension.  So you're on a month to month or you signed an extension that puts  and you just didn't even think about it. OK, here's what you do.  This is what I do is once winter starts to approach.  Usually for me, it's around like September.  I'll do an audit on all my clients. OK, how happy are they?  How many leads are we getting?  How many are they closing? How generally speaking, one to ten?  What's the health of the relationship? Is it is it a seven plus?  OK, we might be OK. Eight plus, we're definitely OK.  Anything less than a seven, then I'm going to take some action.  And what I'm going to do is I'm going to make October  end of September, maybe mid-September to mid-October.  I'm going to make it the most amazing 30 days they've ever worked with me. OK.  I am going to make sure that these guys remember who I am.  They know where the leads are coming from.  And I'll even go to",

    "pageContent": "the extent, guys, I'll go and I'll put on ads, you know,  150 bucks to 250 dollars in ads to supplement these deals.  Even if it puts me at a break even or a negative,  I will do that to get them to have this amazing last month with me.  And I will let them know like about two weeks out.  I'll be like, hey, I want to discuss with you about, you know, working together.  And I'll resign them into an agreement, even if my first one's not done yet.  We'll say, hey, let's just end that one, sign a new one.  I'll make sure they have the best 30 days of their life.  And then I'll go pitch the agreement. OK.  But if this is the reason I want to talk about this right now,  even though it's just barely the end of, you know, July 1st of August,  you guys have to start thinking about what kind of contracts you're selling  and then how to handle the contracts that you have sold  that are going to be putting you at a really bad time. OK.  Guys, there's nothing wrong, by the way, with running 150 bucks,  200 dollars, 250 bucks per month in ads for 30 days  to sign another six month agreement for six thousand dollars  at a 50 percent profit margin. That's three thousand dollars.  You're spending two hundred and fifty.  You're making three thousand net in your pocket.  That's a 10 X return.  It's not a bad use of money if I don't say.  And I'm not a math genius, but that sounds like one dollar for ten.  Sounds great. OK. You got to be strategic.  These are all the guys.  These are all the nuances. I never would have known this.  I was never taught this.  I was in all kinds of different programs.  No one talked to me about what to do in the winter,  what how to tee it up, how to get people, you know, juiced up  so I could resign.  And no one told me I for sure should do a contract. OK.  And you guys can run the business you want the way that you want to run it.  But again, the thing that I think you should consider  is what I said at the beginning is that I don't give advice.  I don't come on these calls unless I've done it.  And I have lost a lot of money.  I've had some very dark,  some cold, dark nights in the winter.  And I mean that in terms of physically because it's cold and it's dark.  Early is December.  And mentally, because I'm like, I don't know.  When you are in the winter months and you are on paper lead  or you just lost two clients and you only have four clients.  It feels like like heavy, man.  You're like, dude, is this business ever going to be good again?  And then sure enough, by like end of February, March,  things start to pick up, you start landing clients, people start calling you.  Hey, let's talk about that deal.  But it becomes very dark and it's very easy to give up.  It's very easy to get sidetracked.  It's very easy to start jumping to the next thing and having Chinese object syndrome.  So we're talking about this at the beginning of August and end of July  because it's coming up quick.  And I want you guys, as you sell your deals,  start selling deals right now to be thinking, hey,  let's either do a three month or nine.  I",

    "pageContent": "would prefer you guys do a nine month,  but three months better than a six month right now,  which I only would say because of the time of the year.  And these are just things that you guys have to think about. OK.  So imagine there is so much to this business that we've been able to talk about this.  One thing, the seasonality of niches, which I have a million other things  I could cover on this, but this is the overall the gist of this thing.  This is this is what you need to know about the seasonality of niches.  It does exist. It does affect everybody.  And you need to do things to not have it affect you slash.  If you have made mistakes, you need to do things to fight it  and correct it and nip it in the bud before it becomes a problem. OK.  Again, I'm just one person.  However, I have been able to use this model to literally build my dream life.  The the the exact thing that I wanted to do in 2016  when I signed up for my first program.  I remember they asked me like, what do you want?  Why do you want to join this?  What do you want to do?  And all I could think like above the money, above whatever.  There's two things.  Number one, the idea of being able to get out of my bed,  throw on a bathrobe and my slippers, walk into my office,  sit down and make money without having to go out in the heat  and make, you know, cold calls or cold knocks.  That sounded beyond amazing.  Like I couldn't even fathom that was a thing.  And this is before everyone is making money online.  I was like, how could what? That sounds amazing.  I can do it from home and then I can be done and just go to the fridge  and not have to have. It sounded amazing.  Number two was being able to travel the world  and make not just make enough, but make millions of dollars.  I wanted to see the world. I wanted to see.  I wanted to move to Africa.  I wanted to. That was a place that was very important to me.  I wanted to take my family there.  I wanted to see different places.  I wanted to go when it got cold.  I didn't want to be anywhere near the cold.  That was one of the things I didn't want to.  I don't want to see snow for me.  You guys, if you're skiers, that's cool.  And that's your thing. I don't ever want to see the cold.  And so it's it's been really, really fun.  And just being able to do this.  I'm in Dubai right now. If you guys didn't know this,  I'm in Dubai right now.  I've spent time in London. I spent time in Paris.  I spent time in Africa.  And it's only halfway through the year, I guess, eight months, seven months.  But I'm just telling you guys this because  I know some of you guys are sitting there stuck in a job,  stuck in a nine to five or stuck in a business that you can't move  because it's it's a business that is state.  It's it's you have to be there in order for the business to run.  And I'm just here to tell you guys that like it's man.  I personally just think life's too short to not see this entire planet.  If you're not going to travel, I think life's too short to have to be at work.  I was talking to somebody about this yesterday,  and I'm sure you",

So a third of it spent at work, a third of it spent sleeping.  And some of you guys hate what you do.  And some of you guys maybe don't hate what you do,  but you hate where you're doing it with.  Some of you guys maybe don't hate what you're doing it with or what you do,  but you hate, you know, the hours you have to do it.  And so I guess it's like, dude, you have a vehicle right in front of you  building simple assets, doing digital, building a digital real estate portfolio,  getting passive income and living whatever life you want to live.  If that means you want to be in Dubai, be in Dubai.  If that means you want to be in freaking whoever, wherever, Kansas and,  and, you know, hang out where you grew up.  That's it doesn't do that.  It's the best part. It doesn't matter.  By the way, I don't know if that's where you grew up, Lane.  I'm just that that no man's land, Kansas or Missouri thing.  It's hilarious. It's up to you.  You get to choose whatever life you want to live and go.  And this business will fit around it.  So I hope this was helpful for you guys.

Some of you guys don't even have your name on here.  Got Discord user. Right. I don't know who you are.  That's fine. But what I know is that if you guys are paying attention,  you guys can see I'm using my same exact process  that I teach inside of digital landlords.  I am using it right now with you guys and I am giving you guys free leads.  Free leads being you guys are interested in this model.  You guys are interested in getting potentially getting involved.  You guys are interested in potentially, you know,  creating passive income with this model and doing this.  And I'm like, hey, I don't you know, I'm here to earn your business.  Of course, I'm not, you know, just a philanthropist.  But let me you guys test this out.  See what see what you think about some of my life, some of my trainings.  Think about the stuff that I'm giving away for free.  Think about what it's like to work with me on a paid level. OK.  So I just want you to know that anything you see me do inside of my group,  I want you to not just listen to what I'm saying, but pay attention to what I'm  doing. Guys, appreciate you being on.

Sales, as soon as people feel about buying pressure, then all of a  sudden they want to throw their hands up and they don't want, you know, they  want to do it. And so sometimes what happens is we start bringing stuff up  too quick. We start dropping price, we start dropping contract, we start  dropping this and that and the rest on our first call and we lose the deal.  I, sorry. Go ahead. I also, I never call it a contract. I say after he already  said he agrees, I say, okay, I'm going to send you this exclusivity agreement so  you know that I'm only working with you and it's going to stay that on there.  Like take it a lot, make it sound a lot more easy. Then I don't, I never say hey,  sign this contract for six months because that usually scares them. Yeah.  But if you do, it's all about how you say it, right? If you want to, sometimes  I'll say it. I don't care because I'm going to look and go, yeah, there's just  like, is there a contract? Yeah, of course. Obviously, like imagine, imagine  I'm committing to you exclusively. I'm not going to go look for any other  business owners, but you can just cancel anytime. That sounds like a one sided  marriage. That doesn't sound like it's going to work. Obviously, you need to  commit to me for six months. How are we going to judge this off one month? Like  I make it so obvious. Like, of course there's a contract, bro. Did you buy  your cell phone out right? No, of course you didn't. Did you buy your car right?  No, probably not. Just how it is. We do six month agreement, you know? So it  depends. Now you can phrase it whatever. It doesn't matter. And I like what you  say as well, Francesca, but you, if you're going to say it, be confident.  Yeah, of course. Of course there's a contract, bro. I mean, it's a one month  deal and you just freaking get a pick and choose and then go have tea and  crumpets. Come on, bro. You know?",

His name is Joe Brady.  And I've been working with him for about this many years. When he first started, he's a really cool dude, by the way.  And I'm just letting like he's got a wife, he's got a couple of kids. It's like he's a good old boy from this town.  And he was so frustrated because he couldn't grow his business. And so I reached out to him, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  He was sick and tired of like spinning his wheels, paying what's this company called Town Square Media?  He's sick and tired of paying Town Square Media 200 bucks a month for nothing.  So I called him. He wanted leads. He didn't care about what SEO.  He just wanted to get jobs because he wanted to grow his revenue.  And so for those reasons, he's been working with me since 2020, right in the middle of coronavirus.  And he's been working with me every single month. And it's been really, really good.  Here's his numbers. Here's how many leads he's gotten. Here's a text.  And this is another little piece I wanted to mention on the screencast and also on the close.  Whenever you have these little snippets and I talk about this in training, whenever you have a text that says, hey, just close that job.  Two thousand dollars. Just had a big month. Sixty thousand dollars this month.  Screenshot that and keep it in a folder with all of your social proof.  OK, screencast, the screencast, the set up.  That one's so easy because you've already kind of built that trust and they're listening and they have to watch this video and you could show them on the screen.  So, guys, instead of just saying, here's another website that I have.  No, this is Joe and he lives here.  And this was his objection. And here's how much he's making.  And here's what he said. And, guys, I'm telling you that right there, it might take you 30 more seconds,  but it will save you infinite time when you go to close.  OK, so that's another example.

    "pageContent": " Okay, Ariel says, why do you not touch the ones that have CPC as NA?  So the reason why real quick on that, Ariel, is because typically with CPC,  think about it, right?  Supply and demand.  So if the cost per click is zero, that means there's nobody else bidding on it, right?  There's no marketers.  There's no business owners.  There's no one else that's wanting to pay for those ads,  which I can therefore infer that it's worth nothing, right?  So for example, you're going to have a keyword like  cheap concrete companies in Newport, whatever, right?  That CPC is zero.  Why? Because no one cares about it.  So if you want to go like those CPCs,  the reason why is because it's typically it's a waste of time, right?  There's no volume.  It says there's volume, but it's not worth anything.  So if you want to go test it out, cool.  And there's probably like a couple situations where, yeah, it's going to work.  But I'm just using my intuition of saying, okay, there's CPC that's zero,  which means nobody cares enough to pay for it,  which means there's like one of many things, right?  There's too much supply and not enough demand or vice versa.  So that's why, okay?  Hope that makes sense.",

Right now, you're going to need a lot more.  Right now, I need like a bazillion more and it's still one.  Well, right now, you don't know because you haven't closed one, but what I would say is  if you haven't closed one, just go ahead and go off with like a 25% close rate, right?  So you've gotten two because even if you close your next one, you're at a 33%, right?  Yeah.  If you close the one up that year, 25.

You guys are getting on with warm people that are already paying for ads, they already know,  they already like it.  They tasted the nectar, they tried the Costco sample.  These guys are ready to be closed.  So 25% is like very conservative.  So if you want to base it off of that, but also remember your close percentage right  now is going to be vastly different from your close percentage by midsummer when you're  getting damn good at this.",

    "pageContent": " Okay, I want to answer this question. So he said he's truthfully anxious about getting both sites ranked. Okay. So, and then he asked, should he just follow you know our training, or should he infuse backlink so here's what I'm going to.  And by the way, backlinking is is the juice that you add on the, and the end of it it's the steroids.  I think I called it digital steroids, or maybe I call it something else I, I called it something I had a live that I did when I was in Africa and I'll try to link that up.  But first of all, how long does it take. That is, it's really impossible to say, okay, I've had sites where I've been like yeah this looks like low hanging fruit, it's not going to be super difficult.  And I'm going to do all this different stuff just like I did with this other city, and I'm going to rank in three months, and guess what I ranked in three months in the city that looked more competitive, and then this new one.  I did the exact same thing and it took me six months so there's really no way for you to know what I would plan on Edward is if you did the due diligence correctly if you follow the training and you made sure that the, you know, the people that  are in the maps were not the same people in the organic, and you made sure there was they didn't have a ton of backlinks they'd have super, you know crazy content, and they didn't have super age domains all these different things right you checked all those boxes.  I would always plan on and I would tell my business owner or maybe you don't want to tell your business owner but you just want to plan, I would, I always plan on about six months okay six to nine months and I know in my head, my goal is to get it between  four and six, but I always plan on six to nine months because then I don't let anybody down then I can budget my, you know, how much profit I'm making versus my ads, all these different things I always in my mind, from when I get a deal to when it's ranked  six to nine months. That's why I do a six month contract. Okay.  So, that's what I would plan on. Now, if you're in like a very obscure niche with no competition, or you're in a really small town, or you're in, you just did good due diligence, it could happen sooner, it definitely could I've had sites.  I had one site ranked in less than 90 days, and I didn't do any backlinks I didn't do anything special in fact we didn't really do a lot. Okay.  We didn't do a lot but it ranked quickly so I wouldn't worry too much about that what I would do is I would manage expectations that's what you need to focus on.  You can control what you can control but you can't control how fast it ranks, you can control that you're doing activities every day that are going to make your website rank, based on data that we've used that's worked for us that we train you on.  You can you can control how much content you put every day. How many pages you put every day how many new photos, how if you add a backlink, all these different things you can control those.  You can control how you manage the business owners expectations, but at the end of the day, Edward, you cannot control how fast Google ranks you.",

Are masonry and artificial grass good candidates?  So here's the deal, you know, masonry,  I've made a decent amount of money in masonry,  so I would say yes, artificial grass is the same.  Artificial grass, I would go out on a limb  and say it's probably been tapped a little bit  because it's the thing that we use for the training.  And artificial grass isn't like concrete  where it's done every single location.  So artificial grass, you're gonna find deals,  but you're gonna have to look a little bit harder,  but it's a good niche and so is masonry, okay?  So yes, yes to both.",

Should I run some ads to increase calls  even though I'm already ranking number one organically?  Yes, yes, yes, and yes, and it will help.  Okay, let me prove this to you.  Alex, gotta call it in.  Okay, I got a call from my concrete guy,  and if you were on my interview with Juan,  you will hear me and turn to, hey, I'm on Zoom,  I'll call you back.  So as you can see, I'm ranked number one.  My GMB fluctuates right now.  It's getting its ass handed to it, which kinda sucks,  but we just barely did citations and new review today.  But I am number one for most all terms.  I am number one organically, just like your site, right?  And I'm also running ads because when my ads are down,  there's a verification issue or any of this shit,  there's a significant drop.  Even though I'm number one,  there are still a lot of people  that are clicking and paying for,  it's charging me, they're clicking on these, okay?  So yes, it will help.  Yes, you will get different leads.  You will see some overlap.  Some of those people you could argue,  yeah, they would've called you anyway,  but I would definitely,  if you're trying to speed this process up,  throw up an ad, speed this up,  because as Juan was saying today on the interview,  it's all about that sizzle, right?  You guys, sending three leads in three days  is significantly different than sending three leads  over the course of a week or two weeks, okay?  You have a much higher chance of closing that person  if it's the lead, lead, lead,  than if it's lead two, three days, lead,  three, four days, lead.  The momentum's gone.

And honestly, the answer is probably going to piss you off a little bit because there  is no set number of leads, there is no set timeframe, okay?  Because it's different for every person.  So only thing I want to mention on this is there's no set anything, okay?  I've had customers where I have sent three leads over the course of two weeks and somehow  I sold the deal.  I've had customers where I sent five leads in one day and I sold the deal.  I've had customers where I've sent one lead in half a day and I've sold the deal.  Every customer is different because every customer is at a different stage.  Every lead that you send is different.  And so all I want to mention on this, because this is a question I get frequently, is how  many should I send?  I have a couple of rules of thumb, but more than anything, above and honestly, the rules  of thumb are great, but this takes precedence, is it's a feeling.  And you're going to know.  And the more that you do this, the more you're going to know.  They're going to start asking questions and there's going to be this moment in time where  the iron is hot and you need to strike.  And sometimes it's not convenient.  Sometimes you are going on vacation tomorrow and they're ready to talk and you need to  stay up late and you need to do that call tonight.  Or you need to get up at 3 a.m. and you need to do that call before you go on vacation.  And I know it's not convenient.  And I know you'd rather do it after the vacation or on your time, but when the iron is hot,  you got to strike.  You have to strike because that is your opportunity, okay?  And it is a feeling and we're going to get more into this, but I'm telling you that you  just have to feel it.  Their customer is going to be ready.  You're going to know it.  They're going to start asking questions.  They're going to say, hey, when do you want to talk?  Hey, how does this work?  They're going to just put off certain vibes that are going to let you know.  And that is going to be something you're going to learn.  It's something that you have to do rep, rep after rep after rep to learn.  But I do want to share my two rules of thumb.  Outside of that, my rule of thumb is I never try to send more than five leads.  So usually my rule is this.  I send between three to five leads or when they close a deal.  So if I send one lead and they close a deal, I'm getting on the phone.  I don't care if it's the first day and they go and close it right on spot.  If it's the first day I do a duck cleaning lead, they close it over the phone.  I am doing a deal the second they close the lead.  So the second a business owner close one of your leads, you're freaking doing the deal.  However, you do not need to wait for them to close a deal.  So that's something else that gets confused.  You're not just going to send leads and send leads and send leads for them to close the  deal.  That's not how this works.  The purpose isn't for them to make money so they can pay you.  The purpose is for them to see what these are like, for them to go and see the quality  and",

Sometimes I'll send three leads, they'll schedule them, but they're a bit scheduled out so they'll  schedule them for like Thursday, Friday, Monday, and I'm closing the deal on Wednesday.  But they've at least seen these are real customers.  These are people that need estimates.  They want estimates.  These are exclusive leads and that is enough.  So I just want to let you guys know the rule of thumb is I send three to five leads or  they close a deal.  quicker.  That's what I do.  And that's usually a telltale sign that these guys are ready to go.  And then I hop on the phone and then I get on and do the screencast and I hop on the  zoom call and close the deal.  But again, more than anything, I want you guys to know this is a feeling and it's going  to be different on everyone.  It's not going to be, I send three leads, I jump on the phone.  We have these rules of thumb.  We don't send more than five.  We want to send at least three, or if they close one, we have these rules of thumb.  But guys, I want you to trust your gut.

So like I said, we've got Michael Steiner, we've got Shelly Xander, we've got Ritu and  everyone else I mentioned before, Stephanie Prather, shout out to Stephanie Prather.  We interviewed her last week on, it was on Thursday night actually, and coming live from  Las Vegas, Nevada, she is at, she just hit $11,900 per month.  So shout out to her.  Pierre, let's get going, bro.  You can hear me still, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  Let's do this thing.  I'm just making sure that I can still see myself and see you.  Ritu says good morning.  So Pierre, we're going to jump right into it yesterday.  We did a little bit of the other stuff.  Maybe I'll just fill everybody in.  So Pierre was somebody who had tried a bunch of different business models.  He was looking for the right one.  He's originally from France and moved to Thailand once, hold on, see how good I am.  You moved there in 2000, the first time in 2018, and then he moved there again in 2023.  But this time he came here and when he moved to Thailand, he's like, dude, I'm doubling  down on rank and rent and I'm going to make this work.  Before you were doing stuff with fitness and all kinds of stuff, making pretty good money,  but you didn't see the scalability.  How close was I on that story?  Decent?  Decent.  I missed some details, but everything I said was correct, right?  I didn't say anything wrong.  I didn't do fitness.  It was business.  I was consulting freelancers to basically find a customer, but sometimes-  Okay.  I thought for some reason, because I remember you told me one time you met Alex Hermosy,  so I always thought you were in the fitness world.  It's my previous business partner that I started the business with, Anthony, that you might  have talked with before.  So yeah, he was quite big in the fitness in France.  Okay, cool.  All right.  Well, dude, I just want to get into this.  So Pierre's at $12,370 per month.  He has one of his deals, he gets paid a flat fee and then he makes commissions on top.  So this month he's probably going to collect between 15 and 20K per month.  But I specifically want to talk about the details of how you've been able to get to  $12,370.  By the way, again, he's also doing this from Thailand.  So any of you that are outside the US that think, oh my gosh, I can't do this because  I don't have an American accent or I'm not from the US, that's a bunch of crap.  That's not true.  It doesn't matter.  One of our other colleagues that's in my group, Mike V, is in Thailand with Pierre.  He's in a different part of Thailand.  Good friends, yeah.  Yeah, but he's crushing it too.  He's at like 40 grand a month and he's actually targeting New Zealand and all of his clients  are in New Zealand.  So let's start there, bro.  Are your clients in France?  Are your clients in US, Thailand?  Where are you targeting?  100% in France right now.  100% French.  Yeah.  That's",

    "pageContent": "amazing, dude.  So I'm going to ask you this question because a lot of people when they start talking about  targeting the UK or targeting Australia or targeting somewhere beside the US, you know  what they always say?  Yeah.  It's not going to work.  Well, they say it can work, but they're like business owners don't want to pay very much  and it's hard to convince them.  So tell me about that, dude.  How has that been?  I mean, I've lunch, I think maybe two or three ads in the US.  I had a few leads and I've kind of tried both at the same time and I like it clicked faster  France, but I'm still kind of in between, you know, I might go in the US at some point.  But yeah, I think like it's hard to really judge how it is in the US.  But from what I see, it feels more business friendly, just from the culture and what I  see.  But in France, it's also work.  I would say France is probably harder to get the credit card.  But then people are really, how to say, recurring.  I have almost no children.  I have a guy like his struggle amounts, but overall, like they don't want a child.  And yeah, man, it's like probably harder to get going, but then the trust is very high.  That's amazing.  So he is doing this exactly entirely in France.  So those of you that are in your home country, whether you're in Argentina or whatever the  case is, I'm not saying every country is going to work because, for example, I spent a lot  of time in Sierra Leone.  I can already tell you it's not going to work really well in Sierra Leone because people  don't really search the Internet.  They do a lot of referral stuff.  But there are countries, France, I bet you it would work really well in Belgium.  I bet you it would work well in, of course, in London and Ireland and these different  places.  But so that's interesting.  So let's talk about this.  Before we got on, you told me most of your deals are through pre-selling, through going  and getting the client first.  How has it been running ads in France?  So I started, that's probably one of the few things I've tweaked from your model.  Smart campaign didn't work in France.  So I had to straight go into expert mode and it didn't work so well.  Like actually, my first maybe 12 months was I was launching ads, I had a few leads, I  was closing a deal, then no more leads or like one a week or something.  Then the guy would turn.  Then I would try to improve ads.  Then I would go again to sell and until I figure out how to make enough leads, you know.  So I work on it, work on it.  I was about to stop doing Google ads and go all in in SEO because it was working better.  And Mike really helped me out.  Like honestly, I think it's the best guy I met in this community towards Google ads is  just crushing it.  I don't know if you knew that, but he was doing Google ads like four or five years before  he started, which is why he's super good and exactly in this in Legion.  So then we build up the skills and now we have like dedicated landing page and we kind  of duplicate there.  It's super quick and we have like a list of keywords, negative keywords and everything.  So it's just we are much better at Google ads now and now it's working.  We just launched new ads last week.",

    "pageContent": " There is leads coming in, customers are paying and just speed up everything.  So now we are doing ads all the time, except some smaller sites that are already ranked  and we don't really need to put ads and we just want to keep full profit stuff like that.  But the main strategy is pre-selling for sure.  So for the people on this call that maybe don't know my strategy that I teach or that  I believe in, maybe you can just walk them through.  I know some of the people are going to be like, oh, here we go again because we always  talk about it.  Just in a nutshell, obviously everyone in here knows the regular strategy, right?  Pick a city and niche, rank the website, try to go sell it, right?  Tell everyone what we do with pre-selling.  Yeah, I mean, I think it's not boring, man, because I still work through the whole process  once in a while, like every few months to kind of simplify everything and have everything  in my head.  So I think I did it a couple of times, probably, I don't know, a hundred times now because  I didn't close all the deals.  So it's like, first of all, you do the due diligence, you have a whole part of this in  your program, which I think it's great as well.  Basically, you look for enough volume to get enough leads and not too much competition  so you can rank the site for a good area.  Then you build a prospect list.  Now we have a VA that does this, it's super, super simple.  You get people that do Google Ads.  That's a tweak I made.  So I did a post in an approval with Shiv about that.  Now I SMS people, I don't do call call, I use Shiv strategy.  It's super good, man, honestly, for me, I prefer this because I know how to call call.  I'm not afraid to do it, but it's just, I don't know, it's shitty because you are interrupting  people.  With SMS, they get back to me.  So I SMS like the 10, 15 people that I have in my prospecting list and they either SMS  back.  They're like, who are you?  What do you want?  I can do the job, whatever.  Or they call.  So if they call, I just reply and they call me, you know, so it's switch the frame.  That's cool.  Call calling 100% work is just, I don't know, a bit better for me.  I just prefer it this way.  And then I do your 100% your script, the few questions, like I think there is 10 questions,  like when can you do the quote, when can you do the work, whatever.  I qualify this.  And this, at first, I was quite shy when I started, I was like, I didn't know.  Now I really do this more as an interview, you know, I'm like, okay, man, qualify, why  should I send you my lead, you know, and the frame will switch with experience and doing  it more.  And that makes the deal much easier because the guy is like, yeah, yeah, I have a team,  I can do more business, you know, like, are you sure, man?  Are you working on Saturday?  You know, if I send you a quote tomorrow, can you do it?  Yeah, yeah.  They're trying to sell you, they're trying to sell you though, smart.  And that didn't came straight because I didn't do this industry contractor, they are really  strong",

    "pageContent": "frame, like they, I don't know, they are doing heavy stuff all day, so on the phone,  they don't really have time, they don't really care about you, so you really need to understand  how to talk with them.  For me, it took me a month to really figure it out, try again, and I'm still improving  it.  And yeah, after that, I transfer a few leads, with time I transfer less and less and I really  talk, qualify them, qualify them, and then I do the closing call, your script again,  I linked it a bit more with the backend, like now I try to get as many information so then  my team can implement without me doing anything.  That's the main thing.  And then onboarding, usually, I text them a bit, everything's okay, and that's it, man.  So yeah, I love that, dude.  And by the way, I love, this is the thing, guys, is once you have a really good process  that works, you learn it, you do it until you've started to get deals, and then just  like Pyr did, he took my process, he's doing like 90% of it, he did it a few times, then  he realized, hey, I'm gonna make these couple of changes that are, they're not gonna change  the fundamental process, but they're gonna make it a little bit easier, so instead of  cold calling, he's using the text strategy that Shiv's using, everything the same, then  he uses the text strategy, which I love because then they're coming at you, so then the leverage  is with you, right?  So you're not worried about it.  Yeah, so it just completely changes the dynamic.  So guys, yeah, the strategy's really simple.  Instead of waiting for the website to rank, we run ads, right?  You run ads, you run Google ads, and you get leads up front.  You get the leads, you take the leads, you go, you send them to a business owner, you  get them excited, you close the deal, you get the credit card, and then you do everything  that Shiv teaches in this program.  You build the site, you rank the site, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, okay?  One thing I was gonna mention really quick is the reason why I like Google ads.  So I wanna say this.  I actually did a podcast on this yesterday, you guys can check it out on my YouTube channel,  and I put, the title of the podcast was Can You Use Facebook Ads for Rank and Rent, right?  The short answer is yes, you can.  And I want you guys to understand that you can use whatever you want.  The strategy is running paid ads up front to get leads, and sending the leads in advance.  That's the strategy.  The tactic that I use is Google ads.  The reason why I like Google ads over Facebook ads is because there's buyer intent.  That's the biggest, number one biggest reason is there's buyer intent.  What do I mean by that?  If somebody is on Google, they're looking to solve a problem.  Pool deck resurfacing, near me, right?  What are some of the niches you're in, Pierre?  The classic landscaping, concrete, whatever, it's a bit different in France, but honestly,  I was like, if I go to another country, I don't wanna reinvent the niche as well.  I wanna just do the classic one.  I'm probably gonna try some new one, maybe this year, next year, because now we are more  experienced, we have more budget, but at the",

    "pageContent": "beginning, I was like, let's just do the basic.  Exactly.  So same thing, concrete, if somebody's on Google and they type in concrete Paris, France,  I know you're not in Paris or from Paris, but concrete Paris, France, they're looking  for concrete, right?  Whereas somebody on Facebook, they're scrolling Facebook, looking at what their friends are  doing and they see a concrete ad, they're not necessarily looking for concrete.  They might schedule an estimate, they might look for pricing, but they're not looking  for concrete.  So if you gave me, if you said you could have 100 Facebook leads or you could have 50 Google  leads, I'll take the Google leads all day, okay?  However, I will tell you that I do know Facebook ads, you can get a lot more for cheaper.  I do know that there's some advantages there, but here's the other reason I like Google  ads, guys, is if you run Google ads in Paris, okay?  I now get to pay Google to put me on page one of Google, so I get to see what would  it be like ranking number one for concrete on Paris without even waiting six months,  right?  If I run Facebook ads, I have no idea what it's like, what kind of leads, how many leads,  I don't have any idea.  You don't get to test the market in the same way you do with Google ads.  But keep in mind, Pierre, you could do anything.  You could do Bing ads.  You could actually, I always joke, you could go and put on your birthday suit and stand  on the corner and twirl a sign that says free concrete estimate.  You can get free leads and use those.  You could get Facebook, you could get leads inside Facebook groups.  You could put up a billboard.  You could go talk to all your neighbors.  It doesn't matter how you get the initial leads, the thing that we do is we send the  leads up front.  By the way, Pierre, do you know what the birthday suit is in English?  No.  Birthday suit means you're naked.  Oh, OK.  So I'm saying, like, it doesn't matter.  You're getting attention.  You take, you go on the corner naked and twirl a sign.  You're probably going to get attention, but you might not get the best leads.  You might get the wrong, you might put up the wrong impression, right?  I would go on an estimate from someone that's naked on a street corner, personally.  You know what I mean?  Some people might.  So depending on the city, you go to that, do that in Vegas, it probably going to work,  it's probably going to work really well.  So I kind of jumped ahead.  So you're just in the basic niches, right?  Yeah, man.  I think, honestly, this business to do what you did, like to make a six-figure year, six-figure  months, I'm not there yet, but I think I can still do the same niche, you know?  Yeah, no, that's my opinion, dude.  It's like, why are we trying to overcomplicate the process?  Like it already, it's proven to work.  So we know concrete works.  Why not use it?  We know that artificial grass works.  Why not use it?  Why are we trying to find these crazy, interesting, at least that's my opinion.  I think there's definitely money in that.  But guys, I spent the first like year, I built websites and carpet cleaning, towing, landscaping.  Dude, I had like",

And then as soon as I said, I'm just going to go in the boring niches, I started making  a lot of money.  No.  Pierre, I got a couple of questions for you.  And by the way, Pierre, they said they can barely hear you, so I need you to just make  your voice loud.  OK.  There you go.  Luis says, what do you think about hiring someone from Fiverr to get a concrete GMB  verified?  Is it for you or for me?  Well, he's asking for himself, but I think his real question is, would you recommend  doing it?  Would you do it?  I personally would not.  Actually, we're trying right now to find some GMB guys, but we are kind of making a world  hiring process.  So we are, I don't think we did Fiverr, it's Jeremy, my right hand, doing this.  But I think we're trying Upwork, Facebook groups, like all of those guys that know GMB  and actually they have some good techniques.  And the thing is, we just pay if the GMB sticks for 10 days, so you don't really take a risk.  But we are going to try a thousand, maybe hundreds to find a few guys that can open  GMB.  We had someone in France, but the system is not working anymore.  So anyway, I don't think Fiverr is the best place.  I think we have now, I don't know, 90, 100 GMB.  And now all of the Gmail accounts are kind of full of GMB.  Like now we need to kind of have a better process.  So we are looking to build a better process.  But I think if you're kind of on the first side, just do it yourself, do it with your  sister phone or your mom, whatever.  That's the best.  Shiva has a very good strategy for this with the Zoom call.  I don't know if you talk about it in your group.  It's like you do a Zoom call with someone, friends, family, whatever.  That is not so far from where you want to open the GMB and you do like a remote control  on Zoom, which you can do.  Then you can control the other person computer and you can open the GMB with their Gmail  account, which is clean and activate because the main problem is that either your Gmail  open 10 GMBs or Google instantly locks you because they know you are not a concrete guy,  which is going to open one and stop.  And also, if you create a new Gmail, Google is going to be like, OK, this is this is creepy.  It's probably some Indian dudes that is doing this in a row.  So you need a clean Gmail that is used by someone.  So just do it with your friends and family.  All of my friends and family had an open GMB in the first year or first two years.  I love that.  So in short, I don't think Fiverr.  I also agree.  I don't think Fiverr is the best place.  I like to use Fiverr if I need like a logo for five bucks for my GMB.  That's like what I use Fiverr for.  You know what I mean?  By the way, it's called Fiverr, but I don't think I've ever used.  I think I've ever bought anything that was only five dollars, ironically.  It's kind of like there's a store in the US called Dollar General, dude.  And",

    "pageContent": "nothing's nothing's a dollar.  OK, real quick, we have Stephanie.  Do companies in France pay for ads or are you are you finding people like  and second part of the question, do they usually pay for Google ads,  Yelp ads or Angie's List or the equivalent?  We don't have Yelp and Angie, but actually they are owned by the same guy,  which is worth five billion in the San Francisco Diary of Dealers,  something that on HomeAdvisor, he also on Expedia, Investopedia, Match.com,  so Tinder, Ingen, 45% of the dating app.  And he on HomeAdvisor and he also on Travel.com,  which is the equivalent in France.  He has in Italy, in Europe, like this guy is the king of Legion.  And so it's not HomeAdvisor, Angie's, but it's similar in France.  And yeah, they pay for all of this, actually.  It's exactly the same as the US.  They're going to pay for this and for us as well.  Sometimes they're going to stop what they did to pay us.  Sometimes they are a better deal to pay Angie's or like equivalent in France.  It's 100% the same.  I had also when I started this kind of fear that,  oh, they already pay for something, they're not going to pay for me,  but I think you're 200% right.  If they already pay for the lead, it's much easier to sell them.  100%.  So yeah, guys, if you guys are calling, I don't care if you're pre-selling  or if you're waiting for your website to rank.  Once you start getting leads, you should be talking to people  who are already paying for advertising, right?  Because they're already sold on advertising.  If I had a gym or I was trying to sell gym memberships,  I would be targeting people who went to the gym already  and then trying to get them to my gym.  I wouldn't be trying to convince people who don't believe in the gym  to come to my gym.  I would go target people who are interested in fitness  and already have that bill.  It just makes sense.  So don't just open up Google.  My very first deal, guys, it was a towing site.  Ironically, I sold that website to Shiv.  That's a totally different story.  But that website, as soon as the first lead came in,  I didn't know what I was doing.  I just went to Google and called the very first person that I could find.  And they didn't believe in paying for advertising.  So make sure you guys are targeting people paying for advertising.  Pierre, what's your biggest challenge in this right now, in this business?  So I have a sales background and I've seen your strategy work really well.  So it makes me save a lot of time or just go faster.  So my problem has kind of always been more the generating more leads, you know.  Okay.  Generating more leads, getting enough volume.  Yeah.  Okay.  Inventory, inventory.  Okay.  Daniel says, how much do you, this is for both of us.  This is for both of us.  You can answer first.  How much do you guys spend on Google Ads per month?  What's your cost per lead?  And how much do you charge the local businesses?  So I'll let you go first and I'll give my answer because you're in France.  I'm in the U.S.  I think we are at 5K a month in ads right now.  But we have some ads that are running and the guys are not paying us yet  because we",

    "pageContent": "started the same cycle.  So I would say maybe 12K.  I have maybe 4K of Google Ads.  Also, some guys I could lower it down, but they're referring to business.  They took other sites with me, some kind of supporting them with lead.  So I think we could be around 3K if I wanted to really milk it up.  And once again, SEO is ranking ads are going to go down.  So it's like probably like 30 to 40% for me.  Cost per lead depends on the niche.  I don't think it's really relevant, but in France, like gardening, stuff like that,  it's going to be 20 to 40.  Everything is going to be 100.  But I don't think it's really relevant.  You're just going to see how much you're going to sell them.  And what was the third question?  The second question was, do you know what your cost per lead is or do you track that?  Not clearly, but I just kind of look how much I spend a month,  how many leagues I get, how much I sell it.  Am I making 50% or more?  Yeah, I don't really look either or track it super close.  And then the last question is, what's your average  price that you charge your business owners?  800, but I have some deals that are like 200, some that are like 1,500.  I have some guys that I have like four or five sites with me and they pay me 2,000.  So it's really mixed.  And some it's 200 a month, but it's like organic.  I didn't talk with the guy for the like six, eight months.  I take it, but 2,400 a year.  You put it back in SEO, it's a pretty good return.  Why not?  Yeah, that's really good.  So I'll say real quick.  So Daniel, if we're talking about Google Ads, how much do I spend?  So let me break this down.  To get somebody on the phone to do a Zoom call, I spend between 100  and sometimes up to $400 to get somebody on a Zoom call to close them.  Some of you guys might be thinking that's crazy, but let me tell you.  I make my money back as soon as I close the deal.  Even if I spend $500, right?  You make the $1,000, you say it's $1,000 a month, they pay you the 1,000.  I just made my $400 back.  So guess who actually paid for the ads?  The business owner, not me, right?  So that's the way I look at it.  So that's what it cost me upfront.  And then usually per month, if I do really good at choosing the city and niche,  I only have to spend $10 a day, which is about $300 a month.  But I will go up to $20 a day, up to $600 per month, which some of you guys think is crazy.  By the way, my lowest deals are $1,000 a month typically.  So I'm not going to spend $600 if I'm only making $800.  But if I have a $1,000 deal, I'll spend up to 60%.  And again, what Pierre said, your margins are only going to get bigger, right?  As soon as you get ranking, you're going to be able to lower your ad cost  and you're going to make more money in your pocket.  Makes sense.  So honestly, in my opinion, guys, I think",

    "pageContent": "you should have a mix of both.  I think you should have some websites that you're ranking organically.  And there are those really good areas that you found that you're kind of keeping to yourself.  You're adding backlinks, you're adding content, you're doing the rankings little by little,  doing something every day, every week.  I think you should have some of those.  But I think if you guys are not using the strategy of pre-selling with Google Ads,  then I think that you're crazy.  Because you can literally get to the $12,000 mark way faster by doing it.  And you can let other people pay for the ads.  You're not paying for them yourself.  They're paying for the ads.  Makes sense?  And I think also that's important.  But I would say the most important, it gives you trust and confidence in the business.  When you get the strike pumping in, it's very different.  You don't sound the same on the phone, you know?  And there is a huge part about sales.  And sales is like building trust with contractors.  Contractors are getting spammed hardcore.  So you need to build trust with them.  And if you don't trust yourself that there are people paying you every month  and making money with your leads, it's going to be super hard.  For me, it probably happened the same for you, Nick.  But each deal becomes so much faster and faster and easier.  And you're just like, man, you don't take it all good next.  And you call the next guy and you're going again.  And then it's a volume game and you don't really have feelings anymore.  I don't know.  It's so much better.  Once you get the first deal, everything changes, to be honest with you.  OK, here's what I want to do really quick.  I'm going to give away some...  I said yesterday, if people put the word pre-selling on that post,  they would be entered to possibly win some swag.  So here's what I'm going to do.  We've got a couple of comments on here.  Let me go to all comments.  Let's see here.  OK, Shelly Xander said, pre-selling, I'll be on the call tomorrow.  Shelly Xander, if you're live on the call, make a comment, please.  Erwin, are you live?  And Joel Smith, are you live?  By the way, Stephanie Prather, send me a message.  Actually, I'm just going to do it on this call.  You're also a winner because you're at $11,900  and you passed my brother Porter in revenue, which I think is amazing.  Let's see.  So Stephanie, Joel, Erwin, and Shelly, who of you is online right now?  Shelly is live.  Shelly, I'm going to put this right now.  I just need you to go message Ashley De La Rosa.  You'll find her.  She's a friend of mine.  And tell her you won the t-shirt.  She'll send you a promo code and you can just put in the promo code  and it'll send it to your house for free.  So there's Shelly.  Who else is live?  Stephanie, are you still on?  We've got Stephanie.  Stephanie wants her DL hat.  Stephanie, I'm about to place another order of hats.  I don't even think I sell those on the store,  but I'll make sure that as soon as we place an order, I'll get you one.  So you can hold out for that.  Just remind me",

Stephanie has the mug, mousepad, t-shirt.  Joel, Shelly, and then there was one more Irwin.  So let's see if Irwin's on as well.  And I'll send it to him.  And then also is Sadie Wilson on?  Sadie Wilson Tangelson.  Sadie, are you on live right now?  And by the way, guys, if you're on right now and you would rather,  we have these mousepads.  We have a coffee mug.  We have AirPods.  We have some other stuff.  You can trade it for that as well.  Don't worry.  So Sadie, if you're on, let me know in the chat.  Pierre, what's your goal by the end of the year?  1.25 per month on December.  10X.  I love that, dude.  Have you been reading that book?  No, but I mean, I read it a while ago, but I get it.  It's quite simple, man.  10X is bigger, easier than 2X because then you kind of think differently than last year.  I mean, to do 2X now, it's so easy because we are already going to make, I don't know,  160, 180 this year without doing anything.  So it's like, just do more, you know?  And if I just do what I did last year, which is like three deals a month,  I'm already at 500K.  So it's when you do the number, actually, I cannot show because we don't have the webcam,  but I have all my numbers here and I can just see what's going on, you know?  For anyone that can't see, which is all of you, he's got a whiteboard right by his desk  and he's got all of his numbers lined out.  I have a notebook I carry with me, same thing.  So Pierre is going to 10X this year.  Guys, I know it sounds crazy when he says 125K per month,  but you have to remember that it's been done, right?  It's been done.  I've done it.  I went from 8,000 to 10,000 per month to 100,000 per month in eight months.  Ryan Dalton, another guy in my group, he's at $100,000 per month.  It's something that's very, very doable.  And the other thing I like, Pierre, is you're doing it in France,  which I think is really interesting.  It makes it kind of completely wide open as well.  Yes or no, because there is less smaller cities.  For me, it's really hard to judge.  Is it better or not to be in France or U.S.?  One very good part about France is since it's smaller,  I have a lot of referral, like 50% of my customers are from word of mouth.  And honestly, I think if I was optimizing for short term,  I would be making more money now,  but I really take care of my customers, oversell them.  As you can see behind me, this is all quotes that my customers sign. ",

    "pageContent": "We still have much more to put.  And I really care about my customers making money.  And that pays because then they pay more because they get more leads,  they want more sites, they bring their friends.  So that's part of the strategy.  That's why I think we can scale well this year.  And that's why I really focus more on the inventory and the team  to make sure we have enough leads because I know on the sales part,  I'm not really worried.  It's more about will I get enough leads when I build enough website,  GMB ads and stuff so we get enough leads.  I love that.  Okay.  Stephanie said, and by the way, real quick before I go on,  so just to clarify, Pierre,  you have all your customer testimonials on your wall.  It's not testimonials, it's quotes that they sign.  So if I look at them, it's like, this is one shop in Lyon in France.  It's like 5,000 euros.  And this is some tree service for 8,000 euros.  And like I just, when I'm on the closing call with a customer  and like, oh, I don't know if it's going to work for me.  I do like, I mean, bro, like it worked for all of those guys.  Why not for you?  You know?  I like that.  I like that a lot.  That's interesting.  That's cool.  That's cool.  I saw it on Hormuzi.  He had this in his gym with all of the weight loss transformation before and after.  And I was like, what is it in our industry?  You know, and it's quote, man.  I like that a lot.  That's cool.  Okay, cool.  I've never even thought about that.  It's a good idea.  Stephanie says a year ago, I was selling credit card services,  no money, very hard to sell.  I was selling plasma.  Yeah, that's crazy.  That was a year ago.  Now she's now a year later.  She's at $12,000 a month.  She started rank and rent.  April 1st, 2024 in Shiv's group studied for two months.  I feel like there's another part of the story that's coming.  Is that?  Yeah.  So she started guys, April 1st, 2024 is when she officially started.  Hasn't even been a year in Shiv's group.  And then she joined into digital landlords in July.  I think it was like the last day of June.  So in, let's see, July, August, September, October, November, December,  in seven months, she's got to $12,000 a month, $11,900.  So guys, to kind of wrap this up, I think a good business in this business,  this is the best business model on the internet,  but I think a healthy business should have some ranked,  some organically ranked sites.  You should be running some paid advertising to get deals up front  and you should be going all out.  You should be doubling down on this business.  By the way, Stephanie said her first deal that she got.  So by the way, it took her a minute.  Her first deal she got was November.  So it took her July, August, September, October,  took her four or five months to get her first deal doing this strategy.  And now she's absolutely crushing it.  So guys, appreciate you hopping on the call.  I'm going to drop something if you guys want to check it out.  No",

But if you guys go to rentsimplesites.com,  you guys can learn more about the pre-selling strategy that we actually offer  and that we teach.  It's a quick, it's like seven videos, five minutes long.  You can buzz through it in 30, 40 minutes.  That'll give you a better idea of the overall strategy that we use.  And there's a bunch of people that are in this program  that I also work with inside of Digital Landlords.  So if you see that that's something interesting,  you can follow the steps there and find an application and see if it's a good fit.  But anyway, Pierre, thanks for joining, bro.  When am I going to see you back in Dubai?  When are we going to hang out in Dubai again, dude?  Just before that, highly recommend going on the course, guys.  It was super high return on investment for me.  And I knew how to sell, but it still makes my life so much easier.  I don't know if I would have quit because I was committed,  but it made it, I don't know, smooth enough so that I would step by step stack win.  And now it's so enjoyable to do this.  It's, I don't know, just a super great system and sales recipe.  So I highly recommend it.  I appreciate that.  We just had somebody, this kid that I, I'll say this to end.  I just had this kid that I grew, I went to school with this kid back 10, 15 years ago, right?  Went to high school with him.  He's been watching my posts.  He's been, he's whatever.  He saw my brother that, yeah.  So, so he just joined, his name's Dakota.  And he had a tree, he actually, instead of doing this,  he came out of high school, didn't go to college.  He started of all things.  Guess what he started?  A tree service company, right?  I even tried to sell this guy leads when I first started this.  He didn't want it, whatever.  So he messages me last Friday.  He's like, dude, I'm going to have to get a back operation.  He's like, I might not be able to do tree service.  I should have done this two years ago.  I should have started generating leads.  Anyway, he jumps on the call with us and you know what we asked him?  I always ask people this when they jump on the call to get into my program.  I always ask them, I say, why don't you just do this on your own?  You know, I send it back on them.  Do this.  Why don't you just do it on your own?  And I think that's a good question to ask your business owners, guys.  Why don't you do this on your own?  Because they're going to sell themselves on why they should work with you, right?  So I asked him this question, you know what he said?  He said, if somebody would have told me two years ago to buy a pole saw,  a pole saw is the thing with the pole that has the saw on the end that like extends out.  He's like, if somebody would have told me two years ago to buy a pole saw,  I would have made literally over a hundred thousand dollars.  I just didn't know.  So he's like, he's like, I'm not doing that again.  I'm going to go in and learn from people that are",

And I lost, I missed out on a bunch of money.  So guys, sometimes that's why you guys are in here with Shiv.  And that's the reason I'm in here with Shiv is there's things that he's figured out  that he can teach you in five minutes or in an hour on a video that's going to make you  a hundred thousand dollars or is going to save you a hundred thousand dollars.  So quit trying to do stuff on your own and quit trying to reinvent the wheel.  That's my only advice, but anything you want to add?  Yeah, man.  Talking about Shiv, Shiv is like crazy genius, man.  He was making online money at 13 or 16 or he never talked about this because he's like super humble  and he just focused on helping a student and people in the group, but he's super smart.  And we live in a crazy era where he has this scalability of helping multiple people at the  same time so we can have access to him.  But I think overall, he would just not care.  You know, he would be at other business level, same as you, man.  Like, I think you are one of the guys that had the craziest sales experience door to door.  You cannot transform it online, which makes you super unique.  I mean, for me, I'm super bullish on investing in yourself.  And that's always where I make my best return on investment.  For sure.  I 100% agree with that.  So, well, dude, Pierre, thanks for jumping on, guys.  We apologize.  You couldn't see, you couldn't see here.  For another time.  We'll keep the mystery, man.  Yeah, no, everyone's like, who's this Pierre guy?  Maybe it's just AI.  He isn't a real person, guys.  That's the new AI voice.  Yeah, exactly.  If you guys are on this call right now and you want the actual replay of this,  where you can see both of us and you can see Pierre,  we're going to let the mystery out of the box.  Send me a message on Facebook.  I'll upload this to Vimeo and I'll send you guys a link.  So, Pierre, thanks for jumping on, bro.  Hopefully, I'll see you in Dubai or I'll come to Thailand.  We'll send it again on a Tuesday, you know?  We need to talk still anyway.  Anyway, we'll see you guys next week.  Thanks, bro.",

    "pageContent": " Alright, now we are doing the images for the website.  So we talked a little bit about images in our previous module.  We have said that the best practice is to ask your client for pictures.  If you do not have pictures from your clients, I am going to show you how to get some free  images.  My favorite one is actually Adobe stock images.  You are more than welcome if you know none of your clients are going to give you images  and you need to buy some.  It is definitely worth to get a subscription there.  If you only need a couple, I would do the free trial.  The free trial usually up to this day, it includes 10 images.  Because we need 25 images, you do need to create 3 accounts just to get those 25 images.  It can be time consuming to use the free trial.  That is why this is up to you if you want to pay for them or not.  But there is a free trial option, especially for the first site.  I already went ahead and made an account.  Right here, if you are making the free 10 photos account, I am only going to show you.  Keep in mind that you need 25 pictures, but we are only doing the header one and we will  do 4 more pictures underneath just to show you what the rest is going to look like.  Right here, it will tell you how many assets, so how many pictures you have left to use.  Right here, again, when we are looking for pictures, you want to make sure that you are  looking, especially when you are getting stock photos, that they look not stocky.  You want them to look like you are a local company, you actually took those photos.  Make sure you are familiar with what the area looks like.  Obviously, we are located in St. George, so it is very similar to Arizona.  But I am still going to look at what homes and residential properties look in Queen Creek,  Arizona, which is the area that we are focusing on for our website.  I want to make sure that the images that I am putting on the website look like they are local.  So make sure you are going on Zello or anything like that to look at houses or whatever niche  you are going into.  So, let's start with something more broad.  Concrete driveway.  And keep in mind, you can use any other, you don't have to use Adobe Stock.  If you just go into Google and type free stock images, you will get Shutterstock, which has  some good ones, you will get iStock, Pexels, Unsplash, anything really.  So go ahead and use whatever you want as long as you follow those guidelines that we have  said before.  So, let's see.  The header picture is usually the hardest one because the header picture, you really  need to pick one that is looking good because it is going right here.  So, let's see.  This could be in Arizona.  Ok, let's go ahead and download this.  So, just click on license right here.  Ok, it's going to download it right here.  And if you really like the photo up here, it's actually going to give you some other  ones that are similar.  This could be in Arizona too.  It's not a great driveway, but it may work.  Ok, I think this one is pretty, could be, this looks pretty general.  We have three.  I don't know if I like any of those to be my header photo, so I would like my header  photo.  And your header photo could even be a picture of Queen Creek, like a city or a neighborhood.  Let's see, maybe if we type Queen",

    "pageContent": "Creek, Arizona.  Let's see if they have any good ones.  Alright.  Ok, maybe Arizona.  Get creative with how you're searching.  Like for example, if you're going into, I don't know, Alabama and you know that in your  city that you're going after, there's a lot of brick homes, you can actually just search  brick home.  If you know the exact type of house that you're looking for, you can just type that.  This actually looks perfect.  I'm pretty sure there's a stamped concrete.  So, that would actually work.  Let's see, this one would be a good one.  Ok, we already have four.  I think that's stamped concrete.  Um.  But because I'm not sure, just do a quick stamped concrete driveway.  This is when you want to be careful.  Make sure that what you're putting up is exactly what you're looking for.  Ok, yeah, I think that's stamped concrete.  Ok, this would be a really good header photo.  Ok, let's download and we should have all the images that we need.  Ok, let's go back to our website.  There's the header photo right here.  Now we need to optimize the images.  So we need to make them SEO friendly because even images are important when it comes to  ranking, when it comes to optimizing your website to be Google friendly.  So one thing that we want to do is when it comes to optimization of your images, there's  two very important things.  One is resizing the images.  The other one is renaming the images.  See how right now they're called Adobe stock?  Well, nobody that is Googling for your website will see that that photo is called Adobe stock.  Google will and they don't usually like that.  So they want to know exactly what that photo is instead of being an Adobe photo.  And so we're going to rename them.  Now let's, we resize every picture except for the header one.  Usually the header one we don't need to resize because the header picture needs to be at  least 1200 pixels to even look not blurry.  So let's Google a free image resizer.  And again, there are so many options out there.  Just pick one that works for you.  I've used this one before.  A simple image resizer.  So select image.  Download.  Okay.  Let's resize this one.  Usually I want to do it by dimension.  And I would keep them under a thousand pixels.  But usually I like it to do between like 300 and 400.  Let's see, 450.  Okay, that looks silly.  So maybe let's try the percentage because this is not a square picture.  It's hard to make it look natural.  So maybe let's do 30% smaller.  Oops.  We need to select it again.  This one right here.  Okay.  Okay, but we don't really know how many pixels that is.  So let's try different free image resizer.  Okay, let's try this one.  Drop it there.  This should work better because he tells you exactly this is way too much.  So let's make it.  Okay.  And he already tells you this is perfect because you want to keep it max 400  and he already automatically picks a hyphen.  That won't make it look funky.  Let's download the image.  Perfect.  Now I like to open the image immediately.  Now let's go ahead and change the name.  So click here.  And the name of the image really just can be a keyword.  So have your keyword list",

So have your keyword list on hand, whatever you're doing on page SEO  because you're really going to use it.  And it's really easy when you have an image pulled up  because all you need to do is look at what the image is and describe it.  So this is a concrete driveway and that is going to be the name of the image.  You can even put the location that you're trying to target.  So Queen Creek.  And I'm going to save this on my desktop.  You can say whatever you want.  Just make sure you know what it is when you need to add it to your website.  Perfect.  Now let's go back  to our images.  Let's do the next one.  OK, 400.  OK, I'm going to name this.  Because the driveway does not look like it's concrete,  but the sidewalk does.  So I'm going to name this concrete sidewalk.  Perfect.  Let's do  let's do another one.  I should do this one.  OK, this could be the concrete walkway.  It looks like it's stamped concrete.  We can even put the cord of concrete.  Image.  Rename it and do not use the same names or the same images.  Always be creative and use a different name for each image.  So, um, the cord of  concrete.  OK, let's do the next one.  Concrete.  Perfect.  And  so far we have three.  OK, we need another small image,  which I believe is this one.  And then we're going to work with our header photo.  Oops.  OK, right here.  OK, let's see.  OK, this one.  And let's do the same thing.  So for 100,  you can even do 300 if you want to be extra safe.  The reason why we make them smaller  is because  if you have very large images, they look very nice,  but the website takes a longer time to load.  And these people are calling themselves  a contractor.  They want things done.  So if if you  I mean, think about the times that you have searched something  on the Internet and the website was really, really slow to load.  You have probably clicked out of it and clicked a different one.  So that's the reason why we want to optimize things  to make the website load fast.  OK, and we can actually name this stamp to concrete.  So let's download  so let's download  rename  stamped concrete.  Make sure you're spelling everything correctly  and don't leave spacers, by the way, when you're renaming.  So how I have a space right here, that won't be good.  So have everything put together.  OK, and now, lastly, we're going to worry about our header photo.  So let's click out of here, select image.  Make sure it's this one.  Awesome.  So it's four point three.  It's a little big.  So I would probably do two thousand.  That should be better.  You can also crop it, but you can do that in Weebly as well.  So let's try it.  If it doesn't work exactly how we want it,  we can always go back here and edit it.  And how I like to name the header photo is usually the company's name,  not the client name, but our company that we have created with this website.  So in my case, that would be Queen Creek Concrete.  OK, I'm going to save this on my desktop where",

See how that looks.  So you're going to click on replace header layout.  Oops, just kidding.  You're going to click on edit background.  Click out of color, click on image and replace.  OK, upload image, upload a photo from your computer.  OK, right here is our header image.  Let's click on open.  OK, that looks good.  So you can actually, if you hold on to the mouse, you can actually move this around.  I know the house is really nice, but you also want to make sure that people can see the driveway.  So let's keep it that.  Click save usually gets a little bigger.  Perfect.  So you can, if you click here, this little dot, you can make it larger.  OK, that should work.  I think there's a space here.  There's not.  OK, let's go ahead and add our phone number here.  What we like to do, if you have a very colorful image, sometimes it's hard to read.  So we like to do something.  Whatever we have done right here with the color block, we put in the header.  So go ahead and add that up here and let's drag the title in here and the phone number.  OK, let's actually add the company's phone number.  So go ahead and copy that.  Either go on call real, make sure that everything is very detail oriented.  So make sure the phone number double, triple check that it's the exact one that you want  it to be.  Make sure that it's linked to a click to call to the same phone number so people can actually  click and call.  Let's make this smaller.  A little bigger.  All right.  We don't need the color block to be that big.  And Weebly doesn't allow you to make things skinnier.  So a trick to doing by doing that is to put a spacer outside the color block and see how  now you can make it more skinny to fit in there.  So put it outside of the color block and you can actually fix it to fit in there.  And then we can make the color block less of a block by clicking on it under background  transparency.  You can make this less so you can actually still see through the picture behind it.  But it's you can see the letters more and you can make the color block like you can  round the corners.  This is up to you.  I like to round them a little bit so it's not so harsh, but you can do whatever you  want.  And then I usually like to put a divider in between so I have a nice line.  OK, let's make see what this looks like on the mobile.  OK, I don't love I usually like everything to be in a line.  So just switch things up.  If you see this, just go into the theme, change the fonts to make something that looks  better and more aligned.  OK, and now you can also I'm pretty sure if we put a spacer above, it should screen.  No, that won't work that way.  So let's get rid of that.  OK, let's see.  Let's make this a different color.  OK, that looks better.  OK, that looks better.  And then let's change this to be.  OK, let's change the and now that we know what the header looks like, it's easier to  make",

So let's grab.  Maybe we just need to do a gray.  OK, now that it's really hard to see the font.  This is a little annoying.  Whenever you're going with a dark color in the form, you just have to click on theme,  click on fonts and then paragraph text.  You're going to have to make that white and then it's going to be invisible here.  So you have to manually make that black.  But that's OK.  I don't love.  That.  Don't love you, neither of them.  OK, we want to make this white.  You can actually see it.  You probably want to make this yellow.  Like the phone number.  And obviously, this is not I mean, there's no rule in this.  It's whatever you think looks decent.  I would probably go with it.  There.  You can also make the form like a little smaller.  I feel like that looks better.

I don't know if you remember when we were putting this into the desktop  into the mobile phone.  Look, this content would actually be disappearing.  So well, when you add an image, as I said, in the module in the second  module, this comes back.  So OK, go back to desktop and you're going to do the same down here  with the other three images that we downloaded.  So one.  Two.  Three.  All right, make sure the pictures are looking good.  One thing that I like to do, and this is totally up to you, just giving  you ideas where the pictures are.  You can put it like a dark gray.  You can match the same dark gray as the quote form.  And then one last thing you need to do to optimize your images  to be SEO friendly is click on the image right here.  Go all the way to advanced and make sure you have an alt text.  An alt text is pretty much another description of what the image is.  So I'm pretty sure if you are.  Like have some kind of disability and you can't see the image,  there is a way that you can see the description of the image.  And that's what the alt text is also used for is for people to identify  whatever is on the image.  So just be descriptive about it.  For example, this could be stamped.  Concrete for house.  Walkway.  And you're going to do this for these three images  and all the other images as well.  And then make sure you're always publishing after you're done.  And that's all you have to do.  So do that for all 25 images and you're good to go.",
