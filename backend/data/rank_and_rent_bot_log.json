    "question": "what is the first step in due diligence?",
    "response": "The first step in due diligence is selecting and analyzing potential niches and cities. This involves researching potential market opportunities, analyzing competition, and identifying the demand and profitability of the chosen niche in different cities. This step is vital to ensure the feasibility and profitability of the rank and rent business.
