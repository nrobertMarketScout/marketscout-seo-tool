00:00.000 --> 00:03.600
OK, Manuel says, using Ahrefs, are the numbers similar to SEMrush?

00:03.600 --> 00:05.320
Or is it it?

00:05.320 --> 00:06.960
They're going to be different.

00:06.960 --> 00:10.760
So Manuel's asking, are the numbers, really the question is,

00:10.760 --> 00:13.400
are the numbers on different tools the same?

00:13.400 --> 00:13.920
No.

00:13.920 --> 00:17.360
OK, you're going to have to use whatever tool you want to use.

00:17.360 --> 00:19.400
If you want to use Ahrefs, awesome.

00:19.400 --> 00:20.360
Doesn't matter.

00:20.360 --> 00:23.160
You've got to get that baseline, right?

00:23.160 --> 00:26.440
You've got to figure out what is that magic number that you can go off of.

00:26.440 --> 00:27.760
It's going to be different for SEMrush.

00:27.760 --> 00:30.640
It's going to be different for Ahrefs.

00:30.640 --> 00:32.760
It's going to be different for Mangools.

00:32.760 --> 00:34.880
It's going to be different for Keyword Planner.

00:34.880 --> 00:36.120
You've got to find that baseline.

00:36.120 --> 00:38.320
So no, they're going to be it's going to be different.
