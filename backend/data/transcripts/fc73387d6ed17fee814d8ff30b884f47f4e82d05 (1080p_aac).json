{"text": " we went ahead and kind of took some content that we already had it's not great content so don't overthink it don't read through too much of the content that we have prepared this is just to show you how we add the content to your website so we have our Weebly page open okay let's start with the first paragraph I keep opening the wrong one there you go okay just going to copy website right here is the first paragraph and you're going to paste it okay make sure it's online to the side so it doesn't look silly we can definitely add a couple we usually like this content to the same length of the quote next to it so let's go and grab a couple more sentences from below and an easy way to you know because then you're like okay which part which sentence did I copy and paste it which one did I not so I usually highlight in yellow what I've already copied and pasted that way I don't duplicate the content on the website okay this seems enough make it yellow go ahead and copy that in here okay that looks fine now right here we put a page title so what could a page title be actually let's let's copy all the content and then we'll go ahead and make things pretty copy that bring it back here don't know why you did that no because it's the page title I'm gonna put that into the text there you go and again don't read through our content too much it is just a very simple that we were not going to use so it's not it's not great content it's just to show you how to structure it once it's on the website we can you can go on and build more like I would probably like to add probably a little more down here put a little spacer in there I think I already copied that yep okay I like to leave the very last sentences I'll show you how I usually use it copy make it yellow I'm going to copy that here okay the very last few letters I actually like to align them in the center I'll show you what that looks like so we can add that's a little too much so I'm going to you I'm going to just copy this part yeah okay add it down here I'm going back okay the very last sentence I liked it to be something like hey give us a call for a free instant quote hey if you want to get a free instant estimate on your concrete project give us a call or fill out the quote form right above something that catches that actually makes them do somewhat of an action and to contact us that's usually how you want it to end because people are not going to look at the very likely nobody's going to read anything of what you wrote but they're definitely going to look at the header where there's a big phone number and possibly at the bottom because when you go and look for a website we usually look at the bottom then we scroll scroll scroll to see the ending and then you look at the ending you don't look anything that's in between so we put those words and I actually like to align them in the middle perfect and I went ahead and copied the tracking number that I had from Coral okay now how do we structure it we kind of already structured it doesn't look bad this is definitely not even 2,000 words so yours is probably going to look more lengthy let's add some titles and the titles they probably want to be something that's a keyword so post this doc I'm going back to our keyword list we have extended um you can probably put something like concrete contractors let's get some ideas from Google I like that is a concrete driveway worth it and again some of these you're actually going to have once you write the content so like how I did that what is seemed concrete driveway that could be a title so is what was the sentence is concrete driver worth it okay and then we have one more again add a couple more if you have obviously you're probably going to have more content so go ahead and grab add more make it more structural so and more titles and the title can be a long tail keyword list it could also be just a short tail keyword so it could just be like stamped concrete could be a title so get creative it could also be the name of your company if you haven't used it in your content it could literally be Queen Creek concrete contractors or Queen Creek concrete that's it we already put that one we could put what are the pros okay there you go so just make sure that the structure once you're done copying the content actually looks like a structure professionally like you have a little bullet list here and there you can add more bullet lists you are adding see this is my bad this is actually you have some titles you have your phone number added on it and then what I like to do because we now need to link the phone number as a click to call so when people see the phone number right here I want them to be able to click it and call directly because if they're looking at this from the phone and that's something that I like to do consistently while I'm adding the content or really doing anything on the website is to okay so if you see this don't get alarmed so see how our first paragraph is gone because it should be before the quote form the reason why is because we have not added the corner image yet so because we don't have this corner image here it's actually canceling this out so don't worry about it yet as soon as we optimize it we'll do that in the next video we optimize we add images this will show up on the mobile section as well so let's just look make sure that everything looks good from the phone number from the phone screen okay that looks good to me perfect now it's let's inner link within your website and let's link the phone number so I see the phone number here copy oops highlight the phone number copy click the link phone and and put the same phone number click out of it okay see that now it's linked to a phone okay we probably want to make this bold and a color if you go on theme and change fonts and links this is you definitely want to change this so the link color I would probably do either a red or blue so people know that it's a link and they can click on it okay and then when you're going over with your mouse I would probably keep the same slightly darker and again this is up to you on how you want to do it okay so see when you hover that I don't know why that's not showing it doesn't really matter and what you can actually do is just copy this phone number because you already linked it it's ready good to go I click command F if you're a macbook type 480 to find any other phone number that you put in here there it is and I'm just going to paste that format that we made that way it's already linked we don't have to do this again all right now last part is inner linking so inner linking is if you know what a backlink is it's a similar idea but instead of doing a backlink outside of your website with other websites you're just interlinking it within your own connecting every page to each other so if someone ends up in on the corporate driveway they can roll into the home page and every other page okay and how you do that's pretty simple so we usually do three inner links per page and you usually want to keep a you usually want to pick a keyword that's what you're going to interlink so we have a stamped concrete service page so I am going to select stamping concrete interlink it to a standard page and I'm going to interlink it to our service page for stamped concrete that's it now we need a driveway one and again it doesn't need to be the same exact like you can put the driveway concrete in the link to link to be linked to the company's name standard page that's your concrete patio and then let's do one more and you want to do this for each page and make sure you are covering you're not doing the same two pages back and forth you're doing all of the pages here are the concrete services perfect and you're done make sure you can also change let's say you go dark let's say you go dark here you added the background and you want the background to be dark make sure you're changing the font to be white obviously and you do that again you can change the font and everything right here paragraph text you can change and you can make it bigger it does look a little tiny it's black I actually don't think that's black it's a charcoal so we'll make it more black should be more clear better spacing line height there you go you can switch it up pick whatever let me pick one that's pretty clear let's just keep this one and make sure you publish save and obviously keep doing that for all of your other service pages as well and you're done", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 10.52, "text": " we went ahead and kind of took some content that we already had it's not great content so don't", "tokens": [50364, 321,
