Nick says, one more question on my end. Do you still go into city niche combo that looks like

00:03.840 --> 00:10.560
the lowest hanging fruit, but nobody's paying for ads at my stage? Yes, I will. If it's low

00:10.560 --> 00:16.560
hanging fruit. Okay. If you don't have enough money where the bills are paid and some move on.

00:16.560 --> 00:20.560
Okay. Where I'm at right now, it's like, if I see it, like, for example, I remember seeing,

00:20.560 --> 00:25.600
I was doing research and I saw this window tinting, don't love the niche, but I had a feeling

00:25.680 --> 00:30.800
that I would be able to sell it because it was local to where I'm at. And it's so low hanging

00:30.800 --> 00:35.200
guys. It was like the stupidest thing ever. And I was like, I don't even know if I want to do this,

00:35.200 --> 00:40.320
but it was so low hanging. I'm like, I have to do it. We put up a website. I did zero SEO. I'm

00:40.320 --> 00:46.240
talking zero, not a backlink, not nothing. And the site ranked. Okay. So if I see those opportunities,

00:46.240 --> 00:50.480
I'll build them because it literally sometimes can be 45, 60 days. Those suckers are ranking,

00:50.480 --> 00:54.560
which by the way, in these last modules, we're going to be releasing, you guys are going to

00:54.560 --> 00:57.920
learn those strategies. You can start implementing those so that you can get those sites ranked.

00:59.120 --> 01:06.320
But where I'm at now, yes. But as far as like for you, I probably wouldn't recommend it until

01:06.320 --> 01:11.840
you get to a certain level. Okay. Now those are, I'm talking, those, what I'm just to clarify,

01:11.840 --> 01:17.840
I'm talking specifically about city niche combinations where I'm okay. If I let that

01:17.840 --> 01:22.240
thing just rank and I don't touch it for six months or three months or two months,

01:22.240 --> 01:27.040
if you're talking about, do you go into a city niche combination, but you need to pre-sell it

01:27.920 --> 01:33.040
type of a thing? Probably not, dude. Probably not. Like if there's not people paying for ads,

01:33.040 --> 01:37.280
there's just too many people willing to pay for ads for me to dick around to that kind of stuff.

01:37.280 --> 01:41.440
Okay. So that's just my personal preference. Can you still sell people that aren't paying for ads?

01:41.440 --> 01:47.040
Of course. Of course you can. Okay. Of course you can, but it's just, it's like, why, why,

01:47.040 --> 01:49.360
why make it harder on ourselves than we have to?
