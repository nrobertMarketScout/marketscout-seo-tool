00:00.000 --> 00:15.520
Step four of the process guys is the big transition and again this is about my third or fourth

00:15.520 --> 00:16.520
time explaining this.

00:16.520 --> 00:19.520
There are miniature transitions in between each step and then this is the big transition.

00:19.520 --> 00:24.680
This is the transition where we go from kind of pitching them and hooking them into, alright

00:24.680 --> 00:28.520
let me grab your information and actually send you some leads, okay.

00:28.520 --> 00:33.400
So what I like to do is after I explain the deal, which is I give you a couple leads,

00:33.400 --> 00:37.160
we talk in a couple days, then I just transition really simple like okay cool what's the best

00:37.160 --> 00:41.160
number and email to send the leads to, okay.

00:41.160 --> 00:44.840
And they'll start giving it to me and they'll say oh well you know here's my email, okay

00:44.840 --> 00:49.780
cool and then here's my phone number and this is then what we're gonna dive into.

00:49.780 --> 00:54.840
Then what we're gonna do guys is we're gonna explain how these first couple jobs are going

00:54.840 --> 00:55.840
to be handled.

00:55.920 --> 00:58.800
They're going to be live transferred over.

00:58.800 --> 01:03.000
So they just gave us the email, they just gave us the phone number and they go like

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
this.

01:04.000 --> 01:08.400
Alright Jack so how this is gonna work, I need you to save and by the way guys, if this

01:08.400 --> 01:11.480
is you that's gonna be transferring these first couple leads, which it probably will

01:11.480 --> 01:13.360
be, tell them to save your number.

01:13.360 --> 01:15.640
If you're gonna use a different number, tell them to save that number.

01:15.640 --> 01:18.320
If you're gonna use a service, tell them to save that number.

01:18.320 --> 01:20.700
If you're gonna use an in-house person, tell them to save that number.

01:20.700 --> 01:22.880
Tell them the number that's gonna be calling them, but say something like this.

01:22.880 --> 01:25.600
Alright Jack so how this is gonna work is these first couple.

01:25.680 --> 01:31.760
I need you to save this phone number and save it all caps, name my company's evergreen,

01:31.760 --> 01:36.160
put Nick, put answer, put money, put something because for these first couple what I'm gonna

01:36.160 --> 01:40.440
do is I really don't want you having to spend a bunch of time doing this.

01:40.440 --> 01:47.220
So I'm actually gonna call you with the customer on the phone and I'm gonna hand her directly

01:47.220 --> 01:50.520
off to you and I'll make it easy, I'll just pretend that I work for you or whatever so

01:50.520 --> 01:53.320
it doesn't seem like we have to explain a whole bunch of stuff.

01:53.320 --> 01:57.560
But next time I call you and this phone is ringing, it is going to be me with the customer

01:57.560 --> 02:01.000
on the phone and I'll just make a really smooth transition, introduce you guys, I'll step

02:01.000 --> 02:03.360
out and you can schedule her for an estimate.

02:03.360 --> 02:04.360
Sound good?

02:04.360 --> 02:07.200
And by the way Mr. Business Owner, this isn't how we always do it, but just for these first

02:07.200 --> 02:09.760
couple I don't want you having to chase leads around, call them, etc.

02:09.760 --> 02:11.520
I wanna make this as easy on you as possible.

02:11.520 --> 02:15.100
I want you to just get a taste of what this is like.

02:15.100 --> 02:16.100
And that's how I explain it.

02:16.100 --> 02:19.880
I don't ask, hey do you, like guys this is one of the mistakes I'm seeing people make

02:19.880 --> 02:22.840
right now is they're saying, hey do you care if I live transfer?

02:22.840 --> 02:25.660
We typically like to live transfer, are you good at that?

02:25.660 --> 02:30.680
Do not ask questions, do not give them the option or they're just gonna confuse them.

02:30.680 --> 02:32.960
Just say hey, here's how we roll baby.

02:32.960 --> 02:39.680
First couple leads I'm gonna be calling you so save this number, tell them what to do.

02:39.680 --> 02:44.320
Save this number, when I call and the next couple calls when I call you, I am going to

02:44.320 --> 02:47.880
have a customer on the phone so do everything you can and look I understand you can't answer

02:47.880 --> 02:51.720
all of them but do everything you can to answer because these are gonna be hot leads that

02:51.760 --> 02:55.320
really, really want estimates, I'm not gonna waste your time.

02:55.320 --> 02:58.120
Save my number, I'll call you with the customer on the phone, I'll act like I work for you,

02:58.120 --> 02:59.960
we'll make this super simple.

02:59.960 --> 03:03.280
Do not give them the option, that's it.

03:03.280 --> 03:06.360
That's how you explain the live transfer process and the biggest mistakes I've seen is people

03:06.360 --> 03:10.040
asking for permission, hey do you care if I live transfer these?

03:10.040 --> 03:12.200
Nope, you tell them what you're gonna do.

03:12.200 --> 03:15.480
People love being told what to do, I promise you, I know that sounds funny like I'm just

03:15.480 --> 03:18.720
being hilarious, no, they like it.

03:18.760 --> 03:23.480
They like when you sound professional, when you're bold, tell them what you're gonna do

03:23.480 --> 03:27.400
and let them know, hey this isn't gonna be forever, I'm gonna do this for the first couple

03:27.400 --> 03:31.400
so you can get a taste of what this is like after we put something together, if we end

03:31.400 --> 03:35.640
up doing something, don't put too much pressure, after we end up doing something or if we end

03:35.640 --> 03:39.360
up doing something, I'm just gonna send these directly to you or directly to someone that

03:39.360 --> 03:42.800
scheduled your appointments but for these first, I just wanna hand them off live to

03:42.800 --> 03:44.960
you so you can get a taste for it.

03:45.600 --> 03:52.920
Guys, that's it, that is the transition process from who you are, we transition into what

03:52.920 --> 03:57.560
you're doing, damn good reason, same thing, the deal which we just did in the last video

03:57.560 --> 04:02.360
and now this is the actual transition step into getting the name, or sorry, getting the

04:02.360 --> 04:08.360
phone number, getting the email, explaining the live transfer process and we're golden.
