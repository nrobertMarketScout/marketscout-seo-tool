1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
OK, Manuel says, using Ahrefs, are the numbers similar to SEMrush?

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,320
Or is it it?

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,960
They're going to be different.

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,760
So Manuel's asking, are the numbers, really the question is,

5
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,400
are the numbers on different tools the same?

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:13,920
No.

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,360
OK, you're going to have to use whatever tool you want to use.

8
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,400
If you want to use Ahrefs, awesome.

9
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,360
Doesn't matter.

10
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,160
You've got to get that baseline, right?

11
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,440
You've got to figure out what is that magic number that you can go off of.

12
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,760
It's going to be different for SEMrush.

13
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,640
It's going to be different for Ahrefs.

14
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,760
It's going to be different for Mangools.

15
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,880
It's going to be different for Keyword Planner.

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,120
You've got to find that baseline.

17
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,320
So no, they're going to be it's going to be different.
