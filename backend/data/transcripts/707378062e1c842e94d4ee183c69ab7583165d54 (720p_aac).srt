1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,360
Guys, welcome to this little impromptu live that I'm running.

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:12,080
I didn't plan on doing this, but I wanted to share a couple things.

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:18,120
So I didn't make any kind of an announcement in terms of me going live or anything like

4
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,120
that.

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,120
Okay.

6
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,600
So what I wanted to share really, really quick, by the way, it's December 2nd.

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,040
We have takeout Christmas and New Year's Eve and Christmas Eve.

8
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:32,960
We have like three, a little over three weeks of working time left in this year.

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:40,000
And you know, a lot of people in this group, a lot of people in business in general, a

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,080
lot of our clients are a lot of people that we want to work with or potentially work with.

11
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,360
They might be just like taking their foot off the gas.

12
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,680
And so this is a time where you can either take your foot off the gas, which if that's

13
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,520
what you choose to do, that's completely fine.

14
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,160
I used to be so frustrated when I would think about people doing this.

15
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,440
But this business, we do this business so that we can choose the kind of life and lifestyle

16
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,440
that we want.

17
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,000
So I have no problems with that if that's what you choose to do.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,160
But for some of us, like myself, I'm trying to put my foot on the gas.

19
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:15,920
I'm trying to go as fast as possible to the very, very end so that I start the year now.

20
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,920
Okay.

21
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,920
So let me go ahead.

22
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,920
I want to tag everyone real quick.

23
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,920
Let's go like this.

24
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,920
Come quick.

25
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,320
Come quick.

26
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,320
That's what I said.

27
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,320
So I just barely got done this morning.

28
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,320
I woke up.

29
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,760
One of the things I wanted to do that was on my priorities this week and as like one

30
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:38,240
of my to-do's this week that I needed to get done is I wanted to go and review my goals,

31
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,240
my 2024 goals.

32
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:44,520
Now, the first thing, the first problem with this and what I just said is the fact that

33
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:49,200
I needed to go and review, which means that it's been a long time since I've done this.

34
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:56,440
And I'm going to be completely transparent with you guys.

35
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:01,080
I think it was, man, at the beginning of this year, I was, make sure you're checking your

36
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,080
goals every once in the morning, once at night.

37
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:08,060
I think we had Zach Powell on, I think it was like when I was in Africa about the spring

38
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,560
or something like that.

39
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,760
And he was talking about checking your goals every six hours.

40
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,760
And I love that.

41
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,400
I love that idea of that.

42
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,840
And I did it for a while.

43
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,680
And then I got off path and I got off track and I got distracted.

44
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,080
And anyway, today, it's kind of like, I don't know if you guys have ever been in a position

45
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:31,680
where you know that your bank account isn't great and you like avoid looking at it, even

46
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,800
though you know what's in it.

47
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,800
You don't want to look at it.

48
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:40,840
I remember back in 2019, 2018, I hated logging into my account because it just kind of highlighted

49
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,240
the fact that I was in such a bad situation.

50
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:48,640
And then once I got in there, it was manageable, but it was always like I was trying to avoid

51
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,640
it.

52
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:53,120
So anyway, today I knew I was like, I got to get down, I got to look at my goals, see

53
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,200
where I'm at, see how I can course correct, et cetera.

54
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,560
And that's what I did.

55
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,840
So a couple of things that I learned while going through those, and the reason I want

56
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,040
to come and talk about this now is everybody waits until the first of the year to set their

57
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,080
goals.

58
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:12,740
And then the irony is we set the goals on December 25th, September 26, between Christmas

59
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:13,740
and New Year's.

60
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,780
And then everybody goes out on New Year's Eve, they get completely drunk, smashed, and

61
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,820
they start the year with a hangover, right?

62
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,540
And that's, it's crazy.

63
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:24,380
And by the weekend, no one's going to the gym, no one's doing anything, no one's making

64
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:28,060
their calls, no one's doing their due diligence, no one's doing any of this stuff.

65
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:33,900
So what I want to do before the beginning of the year comes, I want to get my goals

66
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,620
in place right now and start working towards them now.

67
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,320
So I have a jumpstart in everybody else.

68
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,100
But a couple of things that I learned and I encourage you guys to go look at the goals

69
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:45,740
that you set early 2024 and just review them.

70
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:49,140
And it hopefully some of you guys had a phenomenal year.

71
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:52,420
Hopefully some of you guys like really, really crushed it and you stuck to your goals.

72
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:57,020
And the disappointing part, guys, at least for me with looking at my goals.

73
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,860
And there was a couple that I hit for sure.

74
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:03,220
And there was a couple. The ones that I hit were not even ones that I was really that

75
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:08,580
excited about or expecting to hit, but with a change of fate and a twist of destiny,

76
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:11,820
I guess, I decided to pick up my slack in some of these areas.

77
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:18,940
But the crazy part is what I started realizing as I was going through my goals is that at

78
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:23,100
the beginning of the year, 2024, I set my goal and then I created the map.

79
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,980
Just like when you guys join this group, right?

80
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,580
You you create you set your goal.

81
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:31,660
And then if you watch exhaustive and satisfied, you go through and it shows you

82
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:34,740
exactly how to create your map to get to the goal.

83
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:37,420
And you do this for every single one of your goals.

84
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,780
It doesn't matter if it's a fitness goal, doesn't matter if it's a spiritual goal.

85
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,260
It doesn't matter if it's a relationship goal.

86
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,540
It doesn't matter if it's a business goal.

87
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,020
It's the same formula.

88
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:47,820
You break it down into quarters and then in the months and then in the weeks, then in

89
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,700
the days and then sometimes in the hours.

90
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:50,980
And you go and you attack it.

91
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:57,420
And once you set the goal, all you have to do and you set the goal, you set the map,

92
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,700
you set like your exact roadmap to get there.

93
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:04,860
All you have to go is it all you have to go and do is just do exactly what's on the

94
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,820
map. You just have to follow the map.

95
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:12,820
If it says that on Tuesday, December or whatever, you need to do five cold calls or

96
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:16,460
you need to talk to five business owners, that's what you have to do, even if you

97
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,460
don't feel like it. Right.

98
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:22,060
Just like the example I always use, if you're in, you know, New York and you want to

99
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:26,620
get to Los Angeles, you got a map and you know exactly how to get there by.

100
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:31,900
January 4th, you know how many miles you need to you need to travel, you know which

101
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,940
states you need to go through, you know where you can stop, where your breaks for

102
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,900
the bathroom, where your breaks to eat, to sleep, et cetera.

103
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,180
You have this entire map laid out and all you got to do is do the map.

104
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,820
But the problem is we get distracted.

105
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:41,900
The problem is we get tired.

106
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,900
The problem is we get, you know, oh, let me go do this.

107
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,540
Let me check out this. Let me go to this state.

108
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:50,100
Look at this. And that's equivalent to us in this business like, oh, I'm going to

109
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,820
start this thing. I'm going to go and do this.

110
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:55,220
I'm going to do that. That trip that's going to come before hitting my goals.

111
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,540
So to me, I sat there today and I was like, I set all these goals at the beginning of

112
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,300
the year. The year passed.

113
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:05,660
This is the part that's like really, really kind of a slap in the face, guys, is

114
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,620
that the year passed, right?

115
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,020
Eleven months has passed since we set these goals, almost 12 months.

116
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:15,940
And there's somebody out there that created a million dollars for themselves, a

117
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:16,940
new million dollars.

118
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:19,340
There's somebody out there that became a millionaire this year.

119
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,980
There's somebody out there that probably for sure that became a billionaire.

120
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:25,300
There's somebody out there that got the body that they have been waiting their

121
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,380
whole lives to get. There's somebody out there that created the relationship that

122
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,820
they've waited their entire lives to create.

123
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:34,180
And then there's some of us or some of you.

124
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:39,060
And I would speak for us in general that like we were in the same spot we were

125
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,500
last year. Right.

126
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:45,380
And it's weird because even if you improve incrementally.

127
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:51,900
The improvement from last year to this year feels better than staying the same as

128
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:55,900
last year, even if even if your last year was better than than my last year, for

129
00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:00,820
example. And I remember this because me going from eight to ten thousand dollars

130
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:04,020
a month, negative sixty thousand dollars in debt to making my first million

131
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,700
dollars. That was the best thing ever.

132
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:09,660
Right. That was the best thing ever because I increased.

133
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:14,540
I did. Now, from twenty twenty to twenty twenty one, we made more money on a

134
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,620
gross level, but I spent more money as well.

135
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,860
And I didn't really make much more money in my pocket.

136
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:22,420
So for twenty twenty to twenty twenty one, I made almost half a million dollars

137
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:26,900
more. I made one point four or five something million dollars, one point four or

138
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,220
five one. And by the way, this is not the course.

139
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,900
This is just with lead generation.

140
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:33,940
I made almost a half a million dollars more than I did in twenty twenty.

141
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:36,540
But I put the almost the exact same amount in my pocket.

142
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:41,340
And I wasn't near as excited at all about that because I didn't really improve.

143
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,700
But going from twenty nineteen from eight to ten thousand dollars a month, barely

144
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,700
making it to getting to a million dollars was phenomenal.

145
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,260
Right. Because I improved.

146
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:54,220
So anyway, all this to say, guys, what I encourage you guys to do before it becomes

147
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:59,180
the first of the year becomes Christmas and we've got like four days, five days and

148
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:02,940
everyone's, you know, cold and drinking spiked eggnog.

149
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:08,940
Why don't we spend time right now, early December, spend time this week reviewing

150
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,780
your goals. Look at where you messed up.

151
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,780
Where did you get off track? What was it that happened?

152
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,300
What what derailed you?

153
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:17,940
What at what point did you decide to take a different route than the route that was

154
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:21,740
going to get you to the Los Angeles or the Miami, which is your ultimate goal?

155
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:25,140
Because all you would have had to do, this is me speaking to myself, is follow the

156
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:28,420
freaking map, Nick, and you could have been to that goal.

157
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,220
You could have done this thing.

158
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:32,500
Guys, there was things I was so excited about that I completely got derailed.

159
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:35,460
And I used personal issues in my life.

160
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,740
Oh, but I'm dealing with this.

161
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,300
Oh, but I got this relationship thing.

162
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,580
Oh, but I got this family thing.

163
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,100
Oh, but I'm here. I'm there.

164
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,500
This, that and the rest.

165
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,860
This happened. Yeah, guys, I got things happen, man.

166
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:49,620
I had some stuff that I had to take care of, some like legal stuff that was

167
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:52,060
complete, I think, complete BS.

168
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,220
It's completely handled.

169
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:57,220
It was it was it was basically a competitor that went and found a loophole.

170
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:01,140
And anyway, long story short, we dealt with that all year and last year.

171
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:04,900
And at times when I wasn't, you know, making that progress to my towards my goals,

172
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:05,820
I was using that.

173
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,220
Some of you guys have a sick pair.

174
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,740
Some of you guys are in the middle of a divorce.

175
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,420
Some of you guys have custody issues.

176
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,340
We all have stuff.

177
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:15,700
And it's just like when you take a road trip, everyone has car issues.

178
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,220
Everyone has the flat tire.

179
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,260
Everyone has this thing.

180
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,220
And you have to just realize those things are going to come.

181
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,660
But you got to stay on track.

182
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,700
And if those things come, you got to make up for it.

183
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:28,220
So, my friends, one thing that I was just going to throw out there,

184
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,820
one thing that I'm thinking about this year is as I'm writing down my goals

185
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,700
and I'm writing down my goals in four different categories,

186
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,220
we're going to have probably an entire live on goal setting

187
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,980
because I think it's super, super important.

188
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:39,340
I know it can become mundane and whatever.

189
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,820
But it's very, very important to write it down and to keep reviewing it.

190
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,140
One of the things I started thinking today as I was writing down my goals,

191
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,340
I was looking at last year's goals.

192
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:50,340
I'm like, how do I want to take any of those and bring them into this year?

193
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,300
Do I want to start completely fresh?

194
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,020
And I started thinking, you know, a couple of years ago,

195
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:59,860
when we talked about goals, I would talk to people about the the goal

196
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:03,340
and then the die goal or the junkie goal, the goal.

197
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:07,460
That's like, hey, if I don't hit this, I'm going to do something crazy.

198
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:10,140
I'm going to I'm going to put an embarrassing picture of myself on the Internet.

199
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,740
I'm going to give away ten thousand dollars.

200
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:14,420
I'm going to do something very, very crazy.

201
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,820
I'm going to publicly humiliate myself if it doesn't happen.

202
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,340
And I also call it the junkie goal. Right.

203
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:25,580
And the analogy with the junkie is that for some reason, the junkie,

204
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:28,780
the guy on the street, the gal on the street that needs the heroin hit

205
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:32,020
or whatever in their arm, they always find a way to get the hit.

206
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,940
They always find a way to get the needle in their arm.

207
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:36,260
They have no money. They have no home. They have no clothes.

208
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,340
They barely are breathing.

209
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:41,940
Yet somehow, someway, whether it's diving for tin cans

210
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:46,940
to go collect enough money to get enough to buy the hit, they always find a way.

211
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,620
Maybe it's sometimes it's not great.

212
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,500
Sometimes it's stealing.

213
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,340
Sometimes it's it's doing some very heinous things,

214
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:56,060
but they always find a way to get the hit.

215
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:00,180
And it's like we for some reason just treat our stuff so casually.

216
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,780
We need to treat it. We need to become junkies in a way.

217
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:05,780
And that sounds so weird and it sounds kind of backwards.

218
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:08,700
But we we should learn from these people, man.

219
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:13,580
They figure out a way no matter what comes to to to get to their goals.

220
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:16,100
And so this year, what I want to do, Stephanie, what's going on?

221
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,980
Good to see you, Bruce. What's going on, Richard?

222
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:21,340
Of course, this year, what I want to do is I'm setting die goals.

223
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,580
I'm setting junkie goals.

224
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:25,500
I'm setting goals of like I'm willing.

225
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,980
The goals that I'm going to set this year are goals that I'm willing

226
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:31,020
to post publicly so that people can hold me accountable,

227
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:34,780
which means I'm going to think about it a couple of times

228
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,500
before I just throw it on my list of like, yeah, I'm going to do this.

229
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,780
I'm going to run the, you know, the Boston Marathon.

230
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,260
I'm going to qualify for the Boston Marathon.

231
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:46,500
I'm going to run a sub three, three mile, three hour marathon.

232
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:50,020
Right. Like, I'm going to think about that before I go and throw that up.

233
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:52,900
And one thing that I'm really considering and I might ask you guys

234
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:56,580
to do the same or consider the same is like as you're going through your goals,

235
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,580
you're reviewing last year and you're looking at this year.

236
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:02,180
What if your goals were public?

237
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:05,460
What if the things that you're you're writing down were there for everybody

238
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,860
to see and everybody could hold you accountable?

239
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,180
How would you change it? I'm not saying to think smaller.

240
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:14,860
I'm saying what I'm saying to think very seriously about what you write down

241
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:18,100
this year. OK, because what I know, guys, is this.

242
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,460
It takes one good year.

243
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:26,580
It takes one. Put your head in the sand.

244
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:27,780
Put nothing in the sand.

245
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,940
Put your head down, put your blinders on, get to work.

246
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:33,060
And guys, in one year, your entire life can change.

247
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:39,540
One year, I watched it in 2019.

248
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:42,100
My life was the same. It wasn't 18. It was the same in 17.

249
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:45,060
It was a little bit better in 17 than it was in 16 because I was broke.

250
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,340
But in 16, it was far worse than it was in 15.

251
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,660
My life didn't change for a long time.

252
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:52,460
And then guess what? In 2020, I figured it out.

253
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,820
I removed the distractions. I got simple.

254
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,220
I got very basic.

255
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:00,980
I got Mr. Scrappy McScrappy, where I didn't care about how I looked.

256
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,100
I didn't care about being out with the boys.

257
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:06,500
I didn't care about playing pickleball, playing golf, being at lunches,

258
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,700
watching Netflix. I was there to make money.

259
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:12,500
I was so sick and tired of being broke and having a credit card credit card

260
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,180
desk sitting on my desk, looking me in the face that I was like, I'm done.

261
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:19,100
And within eight months, I was at one hundred thousand dollars per month.

262
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:23,860
And within 12 months, I was I made my first million dollars,

263
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,180
paid off my debt, was looking at my first rental properties,

264
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,900
looking at it. I think I was in a new house at that point.

265
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:30,500
My entire life changed.

266
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:34,660
And more than just the money that I made in that year, guys, was my identity changed.

267
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:38,260
And one thing that I've realized is that once you get to a certain level in business,

268
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:41,260
a certain level in income, this is not an analogy that I came up with.

269
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:44,220
I think it was probably Brian Tracy and then it was probably Jim Rohn.

270
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,260
And then it was probably one of these other gurus.

271
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,300
But they talk about this thermostat that we have, this financial thermostat,

272
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:53,500
where once we hit a certain level, we become comfortable at that level.

273
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:54,860
And we can't go below it.

274
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,900
And if we do, the heat kicks on. Right.

275
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:00,180
It can also work against us, because as we if we have a really good year,

276
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,180
we make a lot of money.

277
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:03,660
Sometimes negatively, we kick on the AC.

278
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,940
We come back down to where we're comfortable.

279
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:09,820
But one thing I've learned about about myself and my identity

280
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,700
is that once I made a million dollars, once I became one hundred thousand dollar

281
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,100
per month person, I can never go back.

282
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,420
I will never make less than a million dollars.

283
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,860
I just can't. I just can't.

284
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,140
Like, it's who I am. It's my identity.

285
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:26,940
I'm not saying that my my entire self worth is tied to it.

286
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:30,060
But I do not make less than a million dollars.

287
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:33,180
That is like the that is the the floor.

288
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,780
And I will never go less than a million dollars.

289
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,620
I can't imagine making less than a million dollars.

290
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,380
And I don't say that like one of these weird people

291
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,260
that's trying to act like they're super rich.

292
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,460
I'm not the top of any totem pole.

293
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:46,740
It's just it's interesting because, guys, if you will just claw your way

294
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,700
to one hundred thousand dollars per month and see what it's like to be at one

295
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,580
hundred thousand, some of you guys are like, that's not very much.

296
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:55,060
A lot of you guys are like, that's that'd be amazing.

297
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,500
OK, get to one hundred thousand.

298
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,580
See how it feels. Then get to a quarter million.

299
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:00,060
See what life's like at a quarter million.

300
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,380
You're never going to go below it.

301
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,620
Get to a half a million.

302
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,620
Get to seven hundred and fifty thousand, three quarter million.

303
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,620
Get to a million dollars.

304
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:08,740
Get to a hundred thousand dollars per month and see what life's like.

305
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,420
You will never want to go back.

306
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,900
OK, it will completely change your identity.

307
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,460
People will start to talk to you differently.

308
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,620
People will start to respect you more.

309
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,620
People will start to take you more seriously.

310
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:18,660
Doors will be open to you.

311
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:21,540
People will start reaching out to you to to pick your brain.

312
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,540
Instead of you always reaching out to pick up the people's brain.

313
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:26,340
By the way, I hate that sentence.

314
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,500
Everything changes.

315
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:31,100
And what I'm sitting here and trying to speak,

316
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:34,140
I'm basically just sharing my thoughts out loud because I'm talking to myself

317
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:39,380
as I'm thinking through this day, is everything can change in a year.

318
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,460
Your entire life can change in a year.

319
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:44,100
And right now, guys, I feel like I'm in a decent spot.

320
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,700
Financially, I've been in a pretty good spot for a bit,

321
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,460
but I'm not satisfied at all.

322
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:52,700
In fact, I'm disgusted with the progress that I've made.

323
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:58,460
If I look at the progress I made from 19 to 20, compared with 23 to 24,

324
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:01,620
I'm disgusted because it hasn't been much.

325
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:02,620
It's been incremental.

326
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:07,380
And yes, it's at a much higher level than it was in 2019 compared to 2020.

327
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:11,180
But man, I'm just pissing my life away if I'm looking at it.

328
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,660
If I'm being very, very honest, I just made a post about this on Instagram

329
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:17,180
and Facebook about like this year, I'm going to just level with you guys.

330
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:21,180
A lot of the decisions I made, I know nothing was crazy,

331
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:24,100
but like I made a lot of decisions that were very temporary in the moment.

332
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,700
Like I chose, I put this, I chose comfort over calling.

333
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,540
I chose temporary satisfaction.

334
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:33,540
I chose temporary pleasure over long term satisfaction

335
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:37,860
in a lot of different areas of my life, in a lot of different moments of my life,

336
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,940
a lot of different months.

337
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:42,460
Now, it wasn't the entire year, but a lot of the year.

338
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,900
And because of that, I came short on a lot of stuff.

339
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,260
And I'm here being straight, completely honest with you guys.

340
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,980
And again, I even said this on my post.

341
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:52,580
I am not, this isn't a woe me, this isn't a downer.

342
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,100
I'm super excited.

343
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,580
I hope you guys can feel my energy.

344
00:16:55,580 --> 00:17:03,060
I spent about an hour and 10 minutes today on version 3.0.

345
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:07,100
And I'm going to spend another hour and a half, hour to hour and a half tomorrow.

346
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,940
Guys, I'm so pumped about 3.0 and what it's going to look like.

347
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:12,620
Now, I don't want you guys, when's that going to come out?

348
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,580
It's going to be out before the end of quarter one.

349
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,500
I'm making sure this thing is so dialed in.

350
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,580
Now, a lot of the, and we'll get into more of the details there,

351
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:22,740
but like, I'm so pumped about what we have or what's coming for you guys.

352
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,460
And I'm so pumped about those of you that just started,

353
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:28,660
because you guys have something at your fingertips that you can go

354
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,340
and you can escape the rat race with this.

355
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,540
Your entire freaking life.

356
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:36,020
I'm texting one of my buddies right now, who's just about to become a digital landlord.

357
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,620
And he's kind of been on the fence for a while.

358
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,380
I'm super stoked. I hope he watches this video,

359
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,260
because we've been talking for months.

360
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,100
And he's like, I need to do something. I need to do something.

361
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:47,140
Guys, you have the tool in front of you.

362
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:52,980
You have the, literally, you have the thing that can get you to whatever you want to do.

363
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,460
And I used to think everyone should become this, you know,

364
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,300
let's get to a million dollars a month, every single person.

365
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,500
That's not for everybody.

366
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,420
But every single person should escape the rat race.

367
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:05,620
Every single person should be able to live on, you know,

368
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:10,260
money that comes in from assets that they've built and ranked and rented from this business.

369
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,340
You've paid to be here.

370
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,700
The business works.

371
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,460
It's working for me. It's working for Jason.

372
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,340
It's working for Porter.

373
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:20,740
It's working for, I just got a message from Drew Wolber, by the way.

374
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:26,980
And Drew Wolber just barely hit $50,000 per month.

375
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,860
Okay, $50,000 per month.

376
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,860
I don't even know when he started, but it wasn't that long ago.

377
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,900
It was like 18 months ago.

378
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,180
He's at $50,000 per month.

379
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:38,180
He's trying to be on, he's trying to be on Ryan Dalton's heels.

380
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:41,700
Okay, guys, your entire life can change in one year.

381
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,020
So what I'm asking you guys to do is before the end of the year comes,

382
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,220
we're going to do some more goal setting.

383
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,500
We'll do another live on goal setting.

384
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,940
Maybe I'll walk you through how I'm going to do mine.

385
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,300
Maybe I'll walk you through mine live.

386
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:49,700
I don't know.

387
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,660
But what I'm asking you to do is before we get to Christmas,

388
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,980
and there's that little week after Christmas between New Year's,

389
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:58,020
when we're trying to rush our goals and we spend 30 minutes on them,

390
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,540
take time right now, review.

391
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,580
Look where you came short.

392
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,380
How did you get short?

393
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,340
Where did you get distracted?

394
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,540
What distracted you?

395
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,420
Was it worth it?

396
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:05,380
I'm sure it wasn't.

397
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:09,700
Okay, but look at what you traded this year instead of your goals.

398
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,820
Look at what you chose.

399
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:14,260
Look at the temporary pleasures and distractions you chose this year

400
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,780
instead of achieving your goals.

401
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:19,060
Because right now, every single one of us could sit here and be like,

402
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:19,940
I got that one done.

403
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:20,660
I got that one done.

404
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,220
I got that one done.

405
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:21,780
I got that one done.

406
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,060
We'd have the biggest smile on our face.

407
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,500
We'd have the most satisfaction ever.

408
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:29,780
Guys, back to my live on exhausted but satisfied.

409
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,380
That is the thing that you want to chase.

410
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,060
That is the thing that's going to be with you forever,

411
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:37,860
is those moments when you do hard things that you don't think you can do

412
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:42,100
and you pull them off and you have the most satisfied freaking feeling in the world.

413
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,700
I'm reading this book right now.

414
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:47,220
It's about this guy that bought this freaking gold rush town in California.

415
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,180
And he talks about like he's out there working with his hands

416
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:53,460
and he just bought this entire town for just under a million bucks.

417
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,460
And he's like, I read this line.

418
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,500
I highlighted it last night.

419
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,100
I was reading it as I went to bed.

420
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:02,660
And he said, I went to bed, my body went to bed exhausted,

421
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,660
but my mind went to bed at peace.

422
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:09,140
My body went to bed exhausted, but my mind went to bed at peace.

423
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:10,820
That's how I want to live.

424
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,180
Every single day, I want to be freaking exhausted.

425
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,260
Even if it's mentally, I'm probably not going to be super tired

426
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:20,580
sitting in my chair every single day building websites, talking on the phone.

427
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:23,940
I'm not out there working with my hands, but it still is tiring.

428
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:26,260
And I might be mentally exhausted, but I want to have peace.

429
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:29,060
When I hit the pillow, I want to know I gave every single thing that I could give

430
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,660
and I move that needle closer.

431
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:35,140
So I'm basically doing this live for me to go back and look at later

432
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,740
to see where I was at.

433
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,980
But I thought that I'd share it instead of just keeping it within,

434
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:42,580
instead of just putting it in my journal, which I will do as well.

435
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:45,300
I wanted you guys to know that today I went through, I reviewed my goals.

436
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:48,020
I came up big time short, big time short.

437
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:48,660
Doesn't even make sense.

438
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:49,940
I came up short, big time.

439
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:51,700
It wasn't my year.

440
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,740
It wasn't my year at all.

441
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:58,020
I traded a lot of things I could have achieved and I regret that very, very much.

442
00:20:58,580 --> 00:20:59,220
But you know what?

443
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,020
You can't look at the past.

444
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:00,820
Whatever.

445
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:01,700
It's time to move forward.

446
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,740
Instead of waiting until January 1st and just pissing away the rest of here,

447
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,700
I'm ready to start now.

448
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,580
It's December 2nd.

449
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,260
It's cold, baby.

450
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:13,220
But luckily we work inside so I can wear a cutoff digital landlord's shirt.

451
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:16,500
But it's cold outside and that doesn't mean I'm not going to be working.

452
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,220
So guys, go and review your goals.

453
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:19,860
I'm stoked.

454
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,300
We got a live coming tomorrow.

455
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,420
Me and Zach Powell are going live.

456
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:26,500
We're going to be talking about leverage, how you can leverage yourself

457
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,620
and create a beautiful team that can help you grow.

458
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,620
By the way, you don't need a teaser.

459
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:35,540
You don't need that many people to create a seven-figure business in this business

460
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,060
and you don't need to pay that much in payroll

461
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:40,740
because we have things like onlinejobs.ph and all these different tools.

462
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:41,860
But guys, get on that live.

463
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:44,260
Zach Powell's making over $50,000 per month.

464
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,860
He's been doing this for a long time as well.

465
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:51,060
Super solid guy, amazing business owner, amazing entrepreneur,

466
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:51,940
and I'm super stoked for that.

467
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:55,060
So 7 a.m. MST for those of you that are on MST.

468
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,660
Otherwise, do your calculations, guys.

469
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,660
I am going to go be with my kids

470
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,460
and then get back in the saddle.

471
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,500
Back in the saddle, baby.

472
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:02,900
I'm out.

473
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,500
Talk to you guys tomorrow.
