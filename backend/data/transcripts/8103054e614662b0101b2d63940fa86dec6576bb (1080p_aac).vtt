The thing I would say is some of you guys ask, like, when do you ask these questions?

00:02.960 --> 00:08.880
When do you ask about their profit, their ticket size, their close percentage?

00:08.880 --> 00:12.640
You can ask it whenever the hell you want, but here's what I found is if I go through the steps

00:12.640 --> 00:17.920
of the prospecting script, as long as you get your main pitch out and they're still listening to you,

00:17.920 --> 00:21.600
you let them know, hey, I'm going to send you some leads. I want to talk in a couple days.

00:21.600 --> 00:26.560
And they're still cool with that. You got airtime and you just have to read it as a human. Like

00:26.560 --> 00:29.360
after that, and they're like, yeah, that sounds good. Okay, cool. I'm going to send you a lead,

00:29.360 --> 00:33.200
blah, blah, blah. Who do I send it to? Now? I got a little bit of time. If they're giving it to me,

00:33.200 --> 00:37.600
I'm going to ask them to say, okay, so just to double check, do you guys, you guys will

00:37.600 --> 00:42.480
do concrete repairs or do you strictly want like new work? And they're like, okay, new work. All

00:42.480 --> 00:48.480
right. And do you do stamp and flat work or just like, that's a perfect time with what Josh is

00:48.480 --> 00:54.640
saying. Make sure, okay, is there any zip codes that you don't cover? Because obviously every city

00:54.640 --> 00:59.520
has some ghetto and I, you know, I can't get, there's going to be some stuff that comes in

00:59.520 --> 01:03.360
just naturally, but it would be nice to know upfront if you just won't go there, whatever, right?
