What niches are you still hitting during the winter? All of them. All the ones I've been hitting,

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:13,040
I'm going to keep hitting. All of them. Literally every single niche. Now, am I going to be a little

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:18,240
bit more strategic about the cities I'm in? I have to be. I have to be more strategic because

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:24,400
some of these cities, these business owners pack up shop. I know I had this site in New York,

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:31,120
some cities like Rochester had a tree service site. I found out pretty quickly that they just

6
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:36,560
shut it down for the winter. Just shut it down. In fact, what they do is in the winter, they actually

7
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:40,880
just do snow plowing. They do snow removal. They don't even do tree service. They're like,

8
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:45,360
yeah, we're shutting it down November 15th and we're going to do snow plowing. We'll call you

9
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,880
in March. No and ifs or buts about it. They just don't do it. I still do the same niches. I just

10
00:00:50,880 --> 00:01:00,240
get a lot smarter about what cities. Okay.
