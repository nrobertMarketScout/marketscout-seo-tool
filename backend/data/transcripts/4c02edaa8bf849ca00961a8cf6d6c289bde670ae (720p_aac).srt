00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
How can I sell a hooked business owner within consistent leads, working on the first deal?

2
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:11,440
Trey, this time of year, it's all in the setup. This time of year, and for anyone listening,

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,560
this is what you need to do, at least from now until it gets to be about spring,

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,480
you need to make sure not to pigeonhole yourself. What I mean by that is if you call a business

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,520
owner, you hook them and you go, hey, I'm going to get you three leads, and then we're going to

6
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:27,040
talk in three days. Well, guess what? If you don't get three leads, you look like a dumbass.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,760
So what I do at this time of year is I call the business owner, I'm just really open about it.

8
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,200
I'm like, hey, I'm going to get you a couple of leads. It might be in a couple of days,

9
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,880
it might be in a couple, it might be a week, it might be 10 days. I want to get you a couple

10
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:44,880
really good ones. So let's talk once I do that. And I just leave it at that. That way, I'm not

11
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:49,200
pigeonholed into it. But typically, the question you're asking, I'm guessing what happened is you

12
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,480
call the business owner, you hook them, and you're like, hey, I'm going to get you a couple of leads,

13
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,080
and you almost made it sound like you're going to have them three leads in three days,

14
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:00,480
which during the spring, winter, or spring, summer, and fall might be realistic. And it's

15
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,800
like, okay, it's winter. And now the business owner, you're like, shit, is the business

16
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,400
thinking I'm just lying? Does the business owner think I'm full of shit? Whatever.

17
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,240
And so that's the position you're in. So for the specific deal that you're doing,

18
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,840
and maybe you're referencing a deal that you have hooked, you're going to need to just get

19
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,840
gritty, man. You're going to need to go, and what I would do is use some of the Facebook strategies,

20
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,800
go into groups, go into those cities, and search for specific keywords, and see if there's anyone

21
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:31,280
you can just kind of hustle for. That's what I would do for that specific deal. And if you

22
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,080
have more context that you can share on this thread or DM me, let's talk about it. But I'm

23
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:40,640
talking about for future deals from now until the spring. Guys, don't pigeonhole yourselves.

24
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,240
Don't make it sound like you're going to get them three leads in 24 hours or in three days

25
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:50,160
when you don't know. Okay? Keep it open. They don't know that you've given other clients,

26
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,160
they don't know that you gave somebody two months ago three leads in 24 hours or three leads in

27
00:01:54,160 --> 00:02:00,320
three days. They don't have any context. So it's not a big deal. If it's not a big deal to you,

28
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,960
it's not going to be a big deal to them. So if you're talking about a deal you already have hooked,

29
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,560
then my advice would, you're going to have to do some strategies, and you can message me or

30
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,080
comment here or post in the group, because I know a lot of us have talked about these last winter.

31
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:19,120
But for deals going forward, and this is for everybody, don't pigeonhole yourself in. Do

32
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,200
not pigeonhole yourself in. Do not make it seem like you're going to get three leads in three days.

33
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,000
Just keep it, whatever. Hey, I'm going to get you a couple of leads and then let's talk.

34
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,640
Okay? It might be a couple of days. It might be a week. It might be 10 days. You know how it is

35
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,240
this time of year, Mr. Business Owner. It's Christmas, whatever. I'll get them to you,

36
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,960
then let's talk. Does that sound fair? Awesome. Cool. Boom. You're done. And now if it takes you

37
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:46,000
10 days, cool. But guess what? If you get the three leads in three days or three leads in five days,

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,320
you look like a hero. Okay? So that's my answer.
