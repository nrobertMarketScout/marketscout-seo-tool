1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,040
You're overthinking everything.

2
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,840
He says, I guess it's the GMB that throws me for a loop.

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:05,360
Why does that?

4
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:06,160
And you don't have to answer this.

5
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,240
This is a rhetorical question for everybody.

6
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,680
I have not lost a second of sleep over a GMB, guys.

7
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,080
There's three ways to get leads on Google.

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,480
There's paid ads, there's the Google My Business,

9
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,160
AKA the Maps, and there's organic.

10
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:19,440
Guess what?

11
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,240
99% of the people out there

12
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,920
don't know how to run Google Ads.

13
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,440
All the people doing rank and rent

14
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,560
don't know how to run Google Ads.

15
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,440
So guess what?

16
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,480
Their only chance is organic and maps.

17
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,440
And guess what?

18
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,800
Maps just got taken.

19
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,000
So they have one.

20
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,640
And when I say taken, there's still ways to get ranked,

21
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,640
or there's still ways to get verified, obviously,

22
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,000
but it's not as easy as it was

23
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,080
where you just throw it up and it goes.

24
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,520
They only have one way to get leads, right?

25
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,280
Guess what?

26
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,640
It may not be as easy for us to get the GMB,

27
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,040
but we still have ads.

28
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,160
We still have organic.

29
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,240
So that's why I'm saying focus on

30
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,000
how competitive is the organic?

31
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,920
Because if you can get ranked organically

32
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,840
and you can get the ads to supplement,

33
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,240
you will be fine.

34
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,960
In 2020, I don't know how many projects I had

35
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,800
by the time I was making 100K,

36
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,240
but I will tell you that more than half of those

37
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,560
did not have a verified GMB.

38
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,080
We were making money.

39
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,640
We had contracts that business owners were happy

40
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,840
strictly on ads and organic.

41
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,960
And a lot of the organic was taking a while to catch up.

42
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,760
So guys, stop stressing about that.

43
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,720
Don't give up on it.

44
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,400
Not saying to stop trying to figure out ways

45
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,840
that are ethical, that are white hat,

46
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,240
that are above board,

47
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,040
but don't sweat it.

48
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,400
I've never even lost a second of sleep on this whole,

49
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,560
everyone's in their freaking pants about this.

50
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,680
Like, what are we going to do?

51
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,240
What are we going to do?

52
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,320
Just quit stressing, okay?

53
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,360
And I know that's hard

54
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,960
because I'm a stressor when certain areas,

55
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,320
but I'm just telling you for this,

56
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,760
don't stress, okay?
