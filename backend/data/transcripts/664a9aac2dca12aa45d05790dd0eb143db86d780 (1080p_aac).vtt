If you don't have a deal and you're in the middle of like trying to,

00:02.920 --> 00:06.160
you got somebody hooked and you're trying to close a deal. Now I'm asking Jeff,

00:06.160 --> 00:07.720
what would be your recommendations there?

00:08.240 --> 00:11.440
Right. Yeah. I think your first one about if you have a BO,

00:11.480 --> 00:15.720
just let them know and talk to them. That's the best thing. I've gone over this.

00:15.720 --> 00:18.800
I believe it was in the, the last live that I did,

00:19.720 --> 00:23.240
where you can start manipulating some of the keyword themes,

00:24.040 --> 00:27.240
because some of them are going to be more expensive than others. And so some,

00:27.800 --> 00:30.560
you know, the keyword themes are all really broad matched.

00:30.600 --> 00:33.560
And so what you may find, if you go back through your,

00:33.560 --> 00:36.440
your research and your due diligence, you might find certain,

00:38.240 --> 00:42.920
like a volume of keywords with a lower CPC versus a higher

00:42.920 --> 00:44.560
volume with the highest CPC.

00:44.840 --> 00:48.960
And you can start manipulating and maybe removing a keyword theme or two and

00:48.960 --> 00:53.440
hitting refresh and see if that gets your budget lower so that you can still

00:53.480 --> 00:57.320
kind of get some leads coming in while you're trying to get someone on the hook

00:57.320 --> 01:00.200
and someone or why you're, you know,

01:00.200 --> 01:02.560
why you're trying to get that business owner on a hook and land a deal.

01:02.800 --> 01:04.800
So that's definitely a way you can try to stay in a market,

01:04.800 --> 01:09.120
but just remember like up here, like this is now not a thousand dollar a month

01:09.120 --> 01:09.360
deal.

01:09.360 --> 01:13.800
This might be a $2,000 a month deal because I want to turn the ads back on for

01:13.800 --> 01:16.560
the bigger CPC, but that's definitely a technique.

01:17.240 --> 01:19.560
Several of you that I've helped out in the last couple of weeks, that's,

01:19.560 --> 01:22.440
that's been, that's been very helpful.

01:22.560 --> 01:26.280
And you've been able to keep getting ads and you've been able to stay, you know,

01:26.280 --> 01:31.440
18 to 23, $24 a day in a market that if you were going for the main

01:31.440 --> 01:34.080
keyword, you're looking at like almost $40 a day.

01:34.560 --> 01:37.640
So that that's how I would get around it. It's a little,

01:37.640 --> 01:41.080
I know it's confusing to say here, but the last live that I did,

01:41.440 --> 01:44.120
where we recorded it, I demonstrated how to do that.
