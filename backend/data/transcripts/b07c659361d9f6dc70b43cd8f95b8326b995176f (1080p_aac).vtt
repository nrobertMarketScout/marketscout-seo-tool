Do you just run one campaign at a time?

00:02.720 --> 00:06.560
I would recommend doing that until you get your first deal

00:06.560 --> 00:08.240
or until you get comfortable with the process.

00:08.240 --> 00:09.520
But once you get good at it,

00:09.520 --> 00:12.800
I typically like, I typically am running about five at a time.

00:12.800 --> 00:15.680
So I have, think about this, like once you get good at this,

00:15.680 --> 00:19.680
I've got five niches, five one-pagers, five ads,

00:20.400 --> 00:21.920
five business owners on the hook.

00:21.920 --> 00:24.560
And I'm probably three to five, okay?

00:24.560 --> 00:27.200
Because think about it, you know, let's take two of those.

00:27.200 --> 00:29.200
It's taken a couple extra days for leads to come in.

00:30.080 --> 00:31.920
One of those, it's working perfectly.

00:31.920 --> 00:34.880
The other two, you know, it's kind of sporadic.

00:34.880 --> 00:39.360
So I'm kind of running like, that's when I have a setter.

00:39.360 --> 00:41.120
I'm usually running five at a time.

00:41.120 --> 00:42.400
I can handle five at a time.

00:43.680 --> 00:44.720
You're probably gonna,

00:44.720 --> 00:46.560
I definitely recommend starting with one,

00:47.440 --> 00:48.880
watching it like a hawk.

00:48.880 --> 00:50.880
Once you close the deal and you feel comfortable,

00:50.880 --> 00:51.920
and maybe you can go to two.

00:52.560 --> 00:54.400
I mean, you gotta be careful, you don't waste money,

00:54.400 --> 00:55.360
you don't waste leads.

00:57.280 --> 00:59.920
But once you get good at it, man, the sky is the limit.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.160
That's what's freaking amazing about this, okay?

01:03.200 --> 01:04.000
Cool.
