00:00.000 --> 00:04.160
So my only concern is generating the leads right now.

00:04.160 --> 00:06.680
Well, so that's something that you can't really control.

00:06.680 --> 00:08.840
So what I would do is do everything that you can

00:08.840 --> 00:09.920
to make sure that they're coming in.

00:09.920 --> 00:11.300
But don't, like a lot of you guys,

00:11.300 --> 00:12.520
I think the leads aren't coming in.

00:12.520 --> 00:14.160
You go and tweak something on Google,

00:14.160 --> 00:16.120
like, oh, negative keywords, change the keywords,

00:16.120 --> 00:16.960
change the budget.

00:16.960 --> 00:18.920
I think every time you do that,

00:18.920 --> 00:21.160
there's like this process, this period of time

00:21.160 --> 00:23.400
that it has to like recalibrate.

00:23.400 --> 00:24.440
Just leave the leads alone.

00:24.440 --> 00:26.000
If you did it right the first time, just leave them alone.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.160
There's nothing else you can do.

00:27.320 --> 00:30.440
And then what I would do is go do what Ashley did,

00:30.440 --> 00:33.120
or not Ashley, it was Tara.

00:33.120 --> 00:35.800
She was right there and she needed like one more lead.

00:35.800 --> 00:37.980
She literally went on Facebook and found somebody

00:37.980 --> 00:39.660
in that area on like a marketplace

00:39.660 --> 00:41.200
that needed a recommendation,

00:41.200 --> 00:43.320
direct messaged them and got an extra lead.

00:43.320 --> 00:46.960
It was the very lead that she used to close the deal.

00:46.960 --> 00:47.800
Nice.

00:47.800 --> 00:48.640
That was very neat.

00:48.640 --> 00:49.920
Like what city is this in?

00:51.000 --> 00:51.980
Richmond.

00:51.980 --> 00:55.160
So go to Richmond, buy, sell, trade, or whatever the group.

00:55.160 --> 00:57.080
Richmond, there's like, you know,

00:57.080 --> 00:58.720
these Facebook groups go in there

00:58.720 --> 01:01.360
and just do smart searches like recommendation

01:01.360 --> 01:02.200
or deck builder.

01:02.200 --> 01:03.520
And there's going to be some posts

01:03.520 --> 01:05.520
and nine times out of 10, you're going to find some,

01:05.520 --> 01:07.720
it's like, hey, who knows a good deck builder,

01:07.720 --> 01:09.280
message them, boom.

01:09.280 --> 01:10.840
It didn't, you didn't come from Google,

01:10.840 --> 01:12.840
but it's a lead is a lead is a lead is a lead.

01:12.840 --> 01:14.360
And that's like a little hustle you got to do,

01:14.360 --> 01:15.640
but that might be just what you need

01:15.640 --> 01:16.840
to get it over the edge.
