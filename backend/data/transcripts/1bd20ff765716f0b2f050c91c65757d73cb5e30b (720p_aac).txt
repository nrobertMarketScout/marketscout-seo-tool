Marcus says, what type of ROI do you like to see on your ad spend?
If you spend 10K in ad spend, what do you want to see come in for revenue?
So Marcus, I am willing to spend up to about 60% of my total deal size on ads.
So if it's a thousand dollar deal, I'll spend up to 60%.
So do the math on that.
But if I get a thousand dollar deal, I'll spend 20 bucks a day
because then that gives me enough to spend money on content writers and employees and etc.
And still make a profit.
Anything above that, it's too thin.
The margins are too thin and I don't like it.
So about 60%, I'll spend up to 60% on my ads.
Yeah, that's what I would recommend.
Okay.
