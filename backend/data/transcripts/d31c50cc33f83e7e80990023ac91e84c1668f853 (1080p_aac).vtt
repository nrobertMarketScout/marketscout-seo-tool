WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:12.920
All right guys, so we've chosen a niche.

00:12.920 --> 00:14.000
We're not going to overthink it.

00:14.000 --> 00:17.880
If you don't know, just going back to what we talked about before, choose concrete.

00:17.880 --> 00:22.720
If you're going to be analysis paralysis and delay choosing, just choose concrete.

00:22.720 --> 00:23.720
Okay?

00:23.720 --> 00:27.080
So we've chosen the niche, we've done our keyword research, and now it's time to go

00:27.080 --> 00:28.080
and find the city.

00:28.080 --> 00:31.880
I don't want you to overthink this too much, but I also want you to understand how important

00:31.880 --> 00:33.440
it is that we do this correctly.

00:33.440 --> 00:37.000
This is where all the money is made and also, unfortunately, where all the money is lost.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.440
All right, so guys, the very first thing we're going to do is we're going to go and get a

00:40.440 --> 00:44.000
tool that shows us demand, shows us search volume.

00:44.000 --> 00:50.960
And for some of you that chose Ahrefs or Mangools or SEMrush or any of these things, it doesn't

00:50.960 --> 00:51.960
matter.

00:51.960 --> 00:52.960
Okay?

00:52.960 --> 00:53.960
And I'm going to explain why.

00:53.960 --> 00:54.960
So let me just show you this really quick.

00:54.960 --> 00:55.960
All right.

00:56.840 --> 01:01.680
So this, I'm going to show you guys SEMrush, SEMrush.com, SEMrush, it is a little bit more

01:01.680 --> 01:02.680
expensive tool.

01:02.680 --> 01:04.680
It's just something I've been using for years and years and years.

01:04.680 --> 01:07.000
I'm just going to use it.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
You can use any tool.

01:08.000 --> 01:15.000
And I want to stress the importance to you guys that tools do not tell the truth.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
Okay?

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
These tools are not accurate.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
Let me repeat that.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.960
These tools are not accurate.

01:19.960 --> 01:22.400
And so you're not going to take these at face value.

01:22.400 --> 01:25.400
The reason that we're using tools is we want to look at comparisons.

01:25.400 --> 01:26.400
Okay?

01:26.400 --> 01:30.120
We want to see, all right, for example, we have, maybe there's a project that you've

01:30.120 --> 01:33.920
done in Minnesota, Minnesota Tree Service or Minnesota Concrete, okay?

01:33.920 --> 01:38.360
Or not Minnesota, sorry, Minneapolis, Minneapolis Concrete, Minneapolis Tree Service.

01:38.360 --> 01:42.800
And you can then in your head, let's say you've ranked that website, you're in the maps, everything's

01:42.800 --> 01:44.760
fine and dandy.

01:44.760 --> 01:48.400
And you can look at the tools, let's say you're using Mangools.

01:48.720 --> 01:54.360
Well, Mangools tells you that there's only, you know, 50 people searching for Tree Service

01:54.360 --> 01:58.480
in Minneapolis and you're ranked number one and you're ranked number one in the maps and

01:58.480 --> 02:00.600
you're getting a hundred calls a month.

02:00.600 --> 02:07.120
So therefore we can infer or we can interpret that if Mangools tells us it's 50, it's probably

02:07.120 --> 02:08.280
close to a hundred.

02:08.280 --> 02:11.120
So I want to be very clear that these tools are not accurate.

02:11.120 --> 02:12.520
The tool does not matter.

02:12.520 --> 02:17.440
What matters, guys, is that we're consistent with the tool that we use.

02:17.520 --> 02:21.720
Okay, so I'm going to use SEMROSH, SEMROSH, I don't even know how they say it, that's

02:21.720 --> 02:23.240
how much I care about tools.

02:23.240 --> 02:24.240
Just pick one, okay?

02:24.240 --> 02:25.240
Don't overthink it.

02:25.240 --> 02:27.760
If you want something free, use Google Keyword Planner, it's fine.

02:27.760 --> 02:28.880
That's step one.

02:28.880 --> 02:33.360
Step two is what we're going to do is we're going to take a project that you have ranked

02:33.360 --> 02:38.780
number one in the maps for most of the top terms and number one organically, okay?

02:38.780 --> 02:40.600
And that's for a couple of months.

02:40.600 --> 02:43.840
Now some of you guys are going to go, well, I'm brand new to this, I've never done that.

02:43.840 --> 02:48.040
If that is the case, or if you have other projects and you just want to make this easy,

02:48.040 --> 02:51.000
I'm going to let you use one of mine to do the following exercise.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.960
So what we're going to do is we're going to take a site that's been ranking for years

02:54.960 --> 02:59.160
and we're going to in our heads go, okay, this site based on data has produced this

02:59.160 --> 03:00.160
many leads.

03:00.160 --> 03:03.100
So the site that we're going to use is the trusty old Bentonville Concrete, which I am

03:03.100 --> 03:07.400
ranking top in the maps, top in the organic, and I've done this for years and years.

03:07.920 --> 03:14.040
And this site has consistently produced between 20 and 35 leads pretty much every month for

03:14.040 --> 03:18.320
the past three years, two and a half, three years, okay?

03:18.320 --> 03:20.920
So what we want to do is we want to take your tool.

03:20.920 --> 03:22.960
So let's, in my case, I'm going to use SEMrush, right?

03:22.960 --> 03:26.800
So I'm going to go to SEMrush or SEMrush, I'm not even sure how to say it, and I'm going

03:26.800 --> 03:31.680
to type in Bentonville Concrete, okay, and I'm going to see what it says.

03:31.680 --> 03:37.000
So this tool tells me, it tells me there's 40 volume, okay?

03:37.000 --> 03:42.160
In fact, let me go and check recently what we've gotten here, give me a second here.

03:42.160 --> 03:44.580
Because what's, and this is going to be an interesting point, okay.

03:44.580 --> 03:45.840
So let me just give you an example here.

03:45.840 --> 03:49.040
It's June 14th at the time of recording this.

03:49.040 --> 03:56.880
We got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, literally one

03:56.880 --> 03:58.220
a day, okay?

03:58.220 --> 04:04.520
So we can pretty easily estimate that, you know, according to this, that's actually fairly

04:04.520 --> 04:05.520
accurate.

04:05.520 --> 04:11.040
Last month, we can go to May, well, this, you know, this is actually going to be changing

04:11.040 --> 04:12.040
it.

04:12.040 --> 04:20.320
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18,

04:20.320 --> 04:31.440
19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40,

04:32.440 --> 04:36.640
41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, okay.

04:36.640 --> 04:38.000
So here's a couple of interesting things.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.300
Number one is this is not accurate because this has changed.

04:41.300 --> 04:44.760
Just for the record, since I started doing this, this has changed.

04:44.760 --> 04:46.080
The data has changed.

04:46.080 --> 04:49.040
This part of the country has gotten a big influx of people.

04:49.040 --> 04:51.720
There's a lot of building going on, huge building boom.

04:51.720 --> 04:54.100
This didn't used to say 40, just so you know.

04:54.100 --> 04:59.040
And also, you guys are going to laugh because this also used to be about $2 cost per click.

04:59.040 --> 05:00.320
There's been a lot of people jump into the space.

05:00.480 --> 05:03.840
There's been a lot of competitors, a lot of people running ads, and so this has changed.

05:03.840 --> 05:08.480
But I still want you to see that even though this says 40, I'm actually getting more than

05:08.480 --> 05:09.680
40 leads, okay.

05:09.680 --> 05:14.800
I'm getting about 1.25 to every time it says 4.

05:14.800 --> 05:17.880
So if this says 40, it's probably closer to 50, okay.

05:17.880 --> 05:19.640
We can kind of assume based on this.

05:19.640 --> 05:22.520
And if I want to check maybe one more month, you know, I could go and do that.

05:22.520 --> 05:23.520
Look at April.

05:23.520 --> 05:24.520
And I've got three pages.

05:24.520 --> 05:25.760
That looks like it's a pretty accurate estimate.

05:25.760 --> 05:29.080
We're probably getting 50 to 60 leads at this point.

05:29.080 --> 05:31.720
And it's funny because that's how long it's been since I've checked it.

05:31.720 --> 05:36.660
So we're going to just base, basically anything that SEM rush says, we're going to, and again,

05:36.660 --> 05:37.880
this isn't perfect.

05:37.880 --> 05:41.760
We're just going to assume that anything SEM rush says or SEM rush says, it's going to

05:41.760 --> 05:45.260
be about 1.25 to whatever it says, okay.

05:45.260 --> 05:46.580
So now we've got our baseline.

05:46.580 --> 05:50.720
If you guys want to use my Bentonville concrete project as a baseline, great.

05:50.720 --> 05:52.300
If you want to use something else, that's great.

05:52.300 --> 05:55.760
The point is we want to find a ratio.

05:55.760 --> 05:59.200
We want to see what it says with this one compared to another one.

05:59.200 --> 06:03.360
And guys, if you have multiple projects, I would highly encourage you to look at this

06:03.360 --> 06:07.280
on multiple projects so you can get a good baseline number so that, okay.

06:07.280 --> 06:11.200
And you guys might type this into keyword planner and it's going to say 10.

06:11.200 --> 06:16.000
And you're going to know, okay, every time it says 10, it's probably closer to 50, okay.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.200
And that's what I want you guys to look at is we want to have that baseline.

06:19.200 --> 06:23.440
We got to come up with that baseline ratio to say, okay, when it says this, it actually

06:23.440 --> 06:27.280
is 1.25 of whatever it says, okay.

06:27.280 --> 06:28.840
So that's step two.

06:28.840 --> 06:30.760
Now let's get into the fun stuff, all right.

06:30.760 --> 06:34.160
What I'm going to have you guys do now that we've gotten a baseline, which according to

06:34.160 --> 06:38.240
SEMrush, you're going to use this, it's probably going to be about 1.25 to whatever it says.

06:38.240 --> 06:41.440
I'm now going to go over to this little tool that's free.

06:41.440 --> 06:43.360
It's called Google Trends, okay.

06:43.360 --> 06:44.360
Step three.

06:44.360 --> 06:45.360
We're going to go to Google Trends.

06:45.360 --> 06:50.160
You're going to type it in, in your whatever search bar and click on it.

06:50.160 --> 06:53.140
And what you're going to do is you're going to plug in your main keyword.

06:53.140 --> 06:56.500
So I'm going to, and it doesn't need to be the main one, it could be a main one.

06:56.500 --> 06:59.300
So let's just do concrete, do concrete contractors.

06:59.300 --> 07:05.740
I would do concrete, but concrete also encompasses ready mix concrete, a bunch of different stuff,

07:05.740 --> 07:06.740
people that do projects with concrete.

07:06.740 --> 07:10.640
So I'm going to do concrete contractors because that's somebody that is most likely looking

07:10.640 --> 07:12.820
for somebody to pour concrete, okay.

07:12.820 --> 07:15.980
So that's what you're going to do is you're going to type in concrete contractors.

07:15.980 --> 07:20.780
And what this tool is going to do is it's going to tell you what states have the highest

07:21.180 --> 07:26.660
search volume in the United States for this specific term.

07:26.660 --> 07:30.220
And by the way, you guys can use this in different countries, et cetera, okay.

07:30.220 --> 07:33.540
So you're going to go, and this is how you're going to pick a state because what I don't

07:33.540 --> 07:36.000
want you to do is look at a map and just throw a dart.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.940
Now if you live in a city, and I do want to mention this really, really briefly.

07:38.940 --> 07:40.620
This is a really important point.

07:40.620 --> 07:42.700
Do not go into California, okay.

07:42.700 --> 07:44.840
Do not go into California.

07:44.840 --> 07:49.880
If you live in California and you're targeting your backyard or if you have projects already

07:49.920 --> 07:52.640
that you've built, I don't want you to get discouraged.

07:52.640 --> 07:57.720
You can still make money, but I'm telling you right now, there is a lot easier money

07:57.720 --> 08:00.480
to make outside of California.

08:00.480 --> 08:04.340
And this is coming from experience, from calling, cold calling, this is coming from experience

08:04.340 --> 08:05.340
knocking doors.

08:05.340 --> 08:08.300
This is coming from experience of traveling there.

08:08.300 --> 08:14.220
There is just a certain vibe, a certain distrust that happens in that state and it's not worth

08:14.220 --> 08:15.220
your time, okay.

08:15.220 --> 08:17.480
I'm telling you right now, if you're starting from scratch, do not go into California.

08:17.480 --> 08:22.020
If you're going to get dinged on, you know, oh, your licensing isn't done or you don't

08:22.020 --> 08:25.540
have this on your site or whatever, it's going to be in California, mark my words.

08:25.540 --> 08:29.200
So if you have not built sites already, avoid the state.

08:29.200 --> 08:30.200
Not because I don't like it.

08:30.200 --> 08:33.280
I've got friends that live there, I go there a couple of times a year, we've got Disneyland

08:33.280 --> 08:36.120
season passes baby, I'll go there all day long.

08:36.120 --> 08:40.040
But for business, for this type of stuff, avoid California.

08:40.040 --> 08:42.260
I don't know how much I need to emphasize that.

08:42.260 --> 08:46.640
And also if you have projects, if you live there and have projects, it's okay.

08:46.640 --> 08:47.640
You can still make money.

08:47.640 --> 08:48.880
I'm just telling you going forward, okay.

08:48.880 --> 08:51.480
So what you're going to do is you're going to go here, you're going to type in your main

08:51.480 --> 08:53.760
term and you're going to select a state.

08:53.760 --> 08:56.560
Now one word of caution, one little thing I want to mention when you're selecting a

08:56.560 --> 08:58.760
state is think about this year round.

08:58.760 --> 09:03.080
I don't want, you know, a really, really cold state where it's going to get icy blizzard

09:03.080 --> 09:04.480
cold and no one can pour concrete.

09:04.480 --> 09:08.120
So for example, I'm probably not going to hit South Dakota, okay.

09:08.120 --> 09:11.520
It's going to do really well in the summer, maybe okay in the spring, good in the spring,

09:11.520 --> 09:12.520
good in the fall.

09:12.520 --> 09:14.580
In winter, I'm going to lose my client, okay.

09:14.580 --> 09:18.720
Or I'm going to have to really do some kind of a deal where they stay on with me.

09:18.720 --> 09:22.660
So what I like to do is I like to go through these top states and I like to look at ones

09:22.660 --> 09:26.560
just intuitively, okay, that one's not as cold, right.

09:26.560 --> 09:30.820
So for example, like Utah, I know it's really cold in some parts of state, but where I live,

09:30.820 --> 09:32.200
it never gets cold.

09:32.200 --> 09:34.540
So there's literally the city I live in never gets cold.

09:34.540 --> 09:38.700
I have palm trees, people have swimming pools, it's stucco, okay.

09:38.700 --> 09:40.220
Tennessee that'd be a great example.

09:40.220 --> 09:42.980
That one gets cold, but not crazy cold.

09:42.980 --> 09:49.560
South Carolina, decent, right, or I don't know, not Oregon.

09:49.560 --> 09:52.140
North Carolina would be okay, but it still gets kind of cold.

09:52.140 --> 09:54.100
But I'm talking more like the Florida's, right.

09:54.100 --> 09:57.140
Florida never gets cold, relatively speaking.

09:57.140 --> 09:58.900
Nevada never gets cold, relatively speaking.

09:58.900 --> 10:00.500
Texas does get cold, but not as bad.

10:00.500 --> 10:02.740
It's not like, you know, there's always snow.

10:02.740 --> 10:04.180
So just keep that in mind.

10:04.180 --> 10:08.100
And what I'm going to do is I want you guys to, I'm going to tell you the state I'm going

10:08.100 --> 10:09.540
to go into, but I just want to give you ideas.

10:09.540 --> 10:12.380
This is a good way to narrow down states and give you ideas.

10:12.540 --> 10:17.820
What you can do is once you select a state, you can then, if you want city ideas, you

10:17.820 --> 10:23.340
can actually click on the state and typically it will tell you the highest searched cities

10:23.340 --> 10:26.960
or areas within that state, which is a really cool thing to do, okay.

10:26.960 --> 10:31.260
But you also can, can rest assured that if there's a lot of searching, there's probably

10:31.260 --> 10:32.260
a lot of competition.

10:32.260 --> 10:35.420
So what I want you to do is just use this tool to pick a state.

10:35.420 --> 10:40.060
And for this example, for this training, I'm going to use the state of Arizona.

10:40.060 --> 10:41.060
Why?

10:41.060 --> 10:42.060
I live close to it.

10:42.380 --> 10:45.020
Utah does kind of I've been there.

10:45.020 --> 10:46.860
I have multiple projects there.

10:46.860 --> 10:48.540
It's warm most of the time.

10:48.540 --> 10:51.420
I love that because I don't have to worry about on and off and everything else.

10:51.420 --> 10:52.940
And I've had really good luck with contractors.

10:52.940 --> 10:55.740
I'm going to choose Arizona for concrete.

10:55.740 --> 10:59.740
And so what I want you to do is once you select your state, I want you to go type in, you

10:59.740 --> 11:02.220
know, Arizona cities by population.

11:02.220 --> 11:02.460
Okay.

11:02.460 --> 11:03.820
And you're going to just click on one of the links.

11:03.820 --> 11:04.460
Doesn't matter.

11:04.460 --> 11:10.780
And what I want you to do from there is go down and start about like the 50,000 or so

11:10.780 --> 11:11.420
population.

11:11.420 --> 11:12.060
Okay.

11:12.060 --> 11:14.620
I want to work from the bottom up because I want to go.

11:14.620 --> 11:15.820
Guys, I want you to realize this.

11:16.540 --> 11:22.620
I want to choose the smallest population city that still meets the minimum requirements

11:22.620 --> 11:23.980
for demand.

11:23.980 --> 11:27.740
And that's the city I want to target because think about all the big guys, think about

11:27.740 --> 11:31.820
the big companies, the big budgets and the big crews and all the money.

11:31.820 --> 11:33.340
They want to go into the big cities.

11:33.340 --> 11:33.500
Right.

11:33.500 --> 11:35.500
So in Arizona, you know what they want to go into?

11:35.500 --> 11:36.540
They want Phoenix.

11:36.540 --> 11:38.060
They want Tucson.

11:38.060 --> 11:39.980
They want Mesa.

11:39.980 --> 11:41.180
They want Flagstaff.

11:41.180 --> 11:41.580
Whatever.

11:41.580 --> 11:41.980
I don't know.

11:41.980 --> 11:43.180
I don't even know what Flagstaff is.

11:43.180 --> 11:45.100
They want the big cities that you can see on the map.

11:45.900 --> 11:46.780
I don't.

11:46.780 --> 11:47.500
I want cities.

11:47.500 --> 11:48.380
No one's looking at.

11:48.380 --> 11:51.820
I want to be obscure with my city selection because no one's doing it.

11:51.820 --> 11:54.460
And I'm going to kind of cheat the system here because I know a city that's going to

11:54.460 --> 11:57.740
crush it because I've got other projects and other niches in the city.

11:57.740 --> 11:58.940
But I want to show you what I would do.

11:58.940 --> 12:04.540
So from here, what you would do is you would select cities starting at 50 K and you would

12:04.540 --> 12:05.580
work your way up.

12:05.580 --> 12:08.780
So we're going to take Maricopa and you're going to go back over to your tool and you're

12:08.780 --> 12:14.940
going to type in your main keyword or one of them and then type in the city and state

12:14.940 --> 12:15.740
abbreviation.

12:15.740 --> 12:16.060
Okay.

12:16.060 --> 12:19.740
So Concrete Contractors Maricopa, Arizona.

12:19.740 --> 12:22.940
And we're going to see if it pulls any volume and it does 50.

12:22.940 --> 12:23.500
Great.

12:23.500 --> 12:24.140
Awesome.

12:24.140 --> 12:26.140
We're good to go and we're just going to leave it.

12:26.140 --> 12:27.340
Then we're going to go to the next one.

12:27.340 --> 12:27.500
Okay.

12:27.500 --> 12:30.780
So the next one is going to be Catalina Foothills.

12:30.780 --> 12:32.460
So I'm going to go over here.

12:32.460 --> 12:33.660
Sam Rush.

12:33.660 --> 12:36.060
I'm going to type in Concrete Contractors.

12:36.940 --> 12:41.660
Catalina Foothills AZ.

12:42.460 --> 12:43.420
Did I spell that right?

12:44.140 --> 12:45.020
Probably not.

12:45.980 --> 12:46.860
Catalina.

12:46.860 --> 12:47.820
Yes, I did.

12:47.820 --> 12:48.140
Okay.

12:48.140 --> 12:50.700
Now, if you do the first term, don't give up.

12:50.700 --> 12:51.660
Do some variation.

12:51.660 --> 12:53.180
So try just Concrete.

12:54.060 --> 12:54.540
Okay.

12:54.540 --> 12:55.260
Nothing.

12:55.260 --> 12:56.380
Try getting rid of Arizona.

12:58.060 --> 13:02.540
Be careful when you get rid of this abbreviation because sometimes multiple cities, there's

13:02.540 --> 13:03.980
the same name city multiple states.

13:03.980 --> 13:05.580
Make sure you're not looking at the wrong state.

13:05.580 --> 13:09.580
I'll try doing Catalina Foothills Concrete, you know, opposite order.

13:09.580 --> 13:11.260
And I'm just not seeing anything.

13:11.260 --> 13:12.140
I'll try one more.

13:12.140 --> 13:12.380
Okay.

13:13.340 --> 13:17.180
So this one's kind of one of those where I'm just going to assume there's not a ton of

13:17.180 --> 13:17.740
volume.

13:17.740 --> 13:17.980
Okay.

13:17.980 --> 13:20.140
And so I'm going to just, it is what it is.

13:20.140 --> 13:20.780
Okay.

13:20.780 --> 13:21.260
Next one.

13:21.260 --> 13:25.340
And this is the one that I'm going to actually go into, which is Queen Creek.

13:25.340 --> 13:26.220
I've built projects here.

13:26.220 --> 13:27.340
This is an up and coming city.

13:27.340 --> 13:29.660
I've got this like information from clients.

13:29.660 --> 13:31.580
They're like, this city is growing like crazy.

13:31.580 --> 13:32.140
It's awesome.

13:32.140 --> 13:33.660
It's going to keep expanding.

13:33.660 --> 13:36.780
So I'm, I already knew before I did this, this was going to be a good city.

13:36.780 --> 13:40.140
And so I did concrete Queen Creek, Arizona.

13:40.140 --> 13:44.140
Lo and behold, there's 30 volume and we are good to go.

13:44.140 --> 13:51.260
So what I want you to look at, I'm going to type in concrete contractors, Queen Creek AZ.

13:51.260 --> 13:54.220
So it doesn't pull a lot for the concrete contractors.

13:54.220 --> 13:55.740
Let me do concrete patio.

13:57.260 --> 13:59.740
No, let's try Queen Creek concrete.

13:59.740 --> 13:59.980
Okay.

13:59.980 --> 14:01.020
We know there's a term.

14:01.420 --> 14:02.460
Give me a sec here.

14:03.580 --> 14:04.140
Okay.

14:04.140 --> 14:04.540
Concrete.

14:04.540 --> 14:09.740
So the only one that's pulling volume is the concrete Queen Creek.

14:09.740 --> 14:15.740
So that's something to note is it does pull volume, but it's lower than Bentonville concrete

14:15.740 --> 14:19.500
and it doesn't pull volume for every term, but it might just be the perfect one.

14:19.500 --> 14:23.340
So then what you're going to do is now we've looked at a couple of cities and you guys,

14:23.340 --> 14:24.700
you might have to do this for 10.

14:24.700 --> 14:25.100
Okay.

14:25.100 --> 14:30.140
You're going to want to do this at least five, uh, probably five to 10 cities and you're

14:30.860 --> 14:35.500
just going to look at the cities and just see what they say when you add the city and the state

14:35.500 --> 14:37.580
abbreviation to the end of the term.

14:37.580 --> 14:38.380
Okay.

14:38.380 --> 14:43.900
So I want you to start at the 50 K population, work your way up and see which cities do that.

14:43.900 --> 14:48.380
And then what I want you to do guys is you're going to select the city based on the following.

14:48.380 --> 14:51.100
You're going to look at these and here's the criteria that it has to match.

14:51.660 --> 14:53.340
Yes, it has to have volume.

14:53.340 --> 14:57.980
I recommend it having volume within at least 10 of what Bentonville concrete had, which

14:57.980 --> 14:59.500
Bentonville concrete was 40.

14:59.500 --> 15:04.380
So this one right here is it's got to be at least within 10 or, or more.

15:04.380 --> 15:04.620
Right.

15:05.340 --> 15:07.500
So this one fits the bill because it's 50.

15:07.500 --> 15:11.580
This one does not fit the bill because it's zero and this one fits the bill because it's

15:11.580 --> 15:12.140
really close.

15:12.140 --> 15:15.340
It's 30, but here's the kicker.

15:15.340 --> 15:18.140
And this is something I've talked about over and over and over again.

15:18.140 --> 15:21.180
We have to pay attention to the cost per click.

15:21.180 --> 15:22.460
This is the CPC.

15:22.460 --> 15:25.980
For those of you that don't know what that is, that is when you go to Google and you

15:25.980 --> 15:28.540
type in concrete Phoenix.

15:29.900 --> 15:32.140
And these people at the top, you see how this says ad.

15:32.140 --> 15:35.100
And I know some of you guys like this is very basic guys, just relax.

15:35.100 --> 15:37.180
It's something to remind everyone about.

15:37.180 --> 15:38.460
You see how these say ads.

15:38.460 --> 15:40.940
These right here, people are paying per click.

15:40.940 --> 15:43.740
That's why it's cost per click.

15:43.740 --> 15:47.180
So me as a consumer, if I click on this ad right now, if I push click, which I'm not

15:47.180 --> 15:54.780
going to do, it is going to charge this company, whatever the amount it costs in Phoenix.

15:54.780 --> 15:58.540
So if we want to look, this is probably not going to be 100% accurate, but let's just

15:58.540 --> 15:59.340
look for fun.

15:59.340 --> 16:01.420
So let's just do concrete Phoenix.

16:01.420 --> 16:04.460
And it's going to be higher, I would assume, than the other ones.

16:05.500 --> 16:07.260
Actually, it's not bad, believe it or not.

16:08.220 --> 16:08.860
Not bad.

16:08.860 --> 16:10.060
374.

16:10.060 --> 16:13.180
I'm actually really shocked, but you know what else is interesting?

16:13.180 --> 16:15.180
There's only 30 people searching for it.

16:15.980 --> 16:16.780
That's weird.

16:16.780 --> 16:21.260
Okay, go to concrete companies in Phoenix.

16:21.260 --> 16:27.660
You got 210, ton of volume, and it's got CPC, but here's what you also got to realize.

16:27.660 --> 16:30.940
You also have to have your intuition play into this and realize these tools aren't

16:30.940 --> 16:31.980
necessarily accurate.

16:32.860 --> 16:35.020
Guys, everyone's going to want to rank for Phoenix.

16:35.020 --> 16:36.620
I promise you that.

16:36.620 --> 16:40.220
And so I'm just telling you, when we go into the next steps, which is actually assessing

16:40.220 --> 16:44.380
and looking at the competition, my intuition tells me it's probably going to be really

16:44.380 --> 16:44.940
competitive.

16:44.940 --> 16:49.900
So you're going to look at these different cities and you're going to make sure, and

16:49.900 --> 16:56.140
you're going to find one that has at least within 10 or more of what Bentonville Concrete

16:56.140 --> 17:00.540
is, which is 40 search volume, according to SEMrush on this tool.

17:01.340 --> 17:08.780
And then you got to make sure it has a CPC of less than $5, but more than zero.

17:08.780 --> 17:15.820
If the CPC is $0, $0 cost per click, you can safely assume that that traffic is worth

17:15.820 --> 17:17.580
nothing because no one else wants it.

17:17.580 --> 17:19.020
So why would I, right?

17:19.020 --> 17:20.700
So for example, in this one, yeah, cool.

17:20.700 --> 17:22.300
There's 50 people searching for it.

17:22.300 --> 17:25.020
It says, but no one's actually bidding on it.

17:25.020 --> 17:28.940
No one's paying for clicks, which tells me it's probably worth nothing.

17:28.940 --> 17:34.940
So I've, and I've tested this, guys, you're not going to get like, for some reason, it

17:34.940 --> 17:35.820
just doesn't work.

17:35.820 --> 17:37.740
So if it says zero, it doesn't work.

17:37.740 --> 17:39.740
If it says 10, it typically doesn't work.

17:39.740 --> 17:44.860
And I'm telling you right now, if I was doing Bentonville Concrete today, I would repeat

17:44.860 --> 17:45.260
this.

17:45.260 --> 17:49.660
I would not go into Bentonville Concrete today, but when I'm telling you, when I did this

17:49.660 --> 17:51.980
a couple of years ago, it was like two bucks.

17:51.980 --> 17:52.300
Okay.

17:52.300 --> 17:56.220
Now, luckily I'm ranked organically, so this doesn't matter, but I would not be going into

17:56.220 --> 17:57.180
Bentonville Concrete today.

17:57.740 --> 17:59.980
When I did a couple of years ago, it was not this competitive.

17:59.980 --> 18:00.300
Okay.

18:01.020 --> 18:02.940
Thanks to me, it is.

18:02.940 --> 18:11.340
So from these searches, we are now going to identify two or three cities that have volume.

18:12.140 --> 18:13.020
Excuse me.

18:13.020 --> 18:18.300
They have volume that's within 10 of Bentonville Concrete or whatever city you choose that's

18:18.300 --> 18:27.500
got at least 30, 40, 50 leads per month or more, and it has a CPC of less than $5, but

18:27.500 --> 18:30.140
greater than zero.

18:30.140 --> 18:30.780
Okay.

18:30.780 --> 18:34.220
So quick, quick, quick, quick recap.

18:34.220 --> 18:34.460
Okay.

18:35.900 --> 18:38.700
Number one, you are going to go and you're going to pick a tool.

18:39.260 --> 18:40.140
Step one.

18:40.140 --> 18:40.460
Okay.

18:40.460 --> 18:41.340
Doesn't matter what it is.

18:41.340 --> 18:42.860
Paid, free, don't care.

18:42.860 --> 18:44.620
You're going to go figure out what the baseline is.

18:44.620 --> 18:48.460
What I mean by that is pick a project that's ranking that you know is getting leads and

18:48.460 --> 18:52.540
it's been getting leads for years and years organically, and you know how many leads it's

18:52.540 --> 18:52.780
getting.

18:52.780 --> 18:57.580
If you don't have one, use Bentonville Concrete and figure out how that compares to what the

18:57.580 --> 18:58.220
tool says.

18:58.220 --> 18:59.260
That's your baseline.

18:59.260 --> 18:59.500
Okay.

19:00.140 --> 19:01.660
So that's number two.

19:01.660 --> 19:05.660
Step three is you're going to use Google Trends to identify a state to start with.

19:05.660 --> 19:05.900
Okay.

19:05.900 --> 19:09.260
If you have a state in mind, awesome, but if you don't know and you're in a new niche

19:09.260 --> 19:11.500
or whatever, go pick a state.

19:11.500 --> 19:19.820
From there, you're going to type into Google state plus cities in population with population,

19:19.820 --> 19:20.940
order of population, whatever.

19:20.940 --> 19:23.340
So Arizona cities by population.

19:24.540 --> 19:26.140
Utah cities by population.

19:26.140 --> 19:32.300
And you're going to then start at 50,000, go to the bottom, start at 50,000, put those

19:32.300 --> 19:37.580
into your tool with the city and state variation and find

19:37.980 --> 19:45.420
cities where it pulls at least what Bentonville Concrete pulls or it's within 10 or more.

19:45.980 --> 19:50.300
And it has a CPC of less than $5 and more than zero.

19:50.300 --> 19:55.180
And guys, if you can find two or three cities with it meet those metrics following that

19:55.180 --> 20:00.140
system, you have got three potential, two to three potential cities that you are going

20:00.140 --> 20:01.820
to go and make money on.

20:01.820 --> 20:04.220
And that is what you're going to do to start.

20:04.220 --> 20:06.620
And next guys, what we're going to do next is we're going to go and we're going to dig

20:06.620 --> 20:07.020
into that city.

20:07.020 --> 20:07.980
We're going to analyze that city.
