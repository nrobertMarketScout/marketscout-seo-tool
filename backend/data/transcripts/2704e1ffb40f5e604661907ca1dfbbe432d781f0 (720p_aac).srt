1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,440
Question, how do you handle the objection

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:05,200
when you are pre-qualifying a business owner of,

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,320
I wanna know how much it costs or what's the deal?

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,280
I come across this objection in a call yesterday

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,520
and I was at the point that I wanted

6
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,780
to hang up the phone and move on.

7
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,720
The fact that I said we could talk about it later

8
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,080
didn't work, she was another level of persistence.

9
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,920
So, Juan, I know we talk about this in the training,

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,760
I don't know if you've gotten through

11
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,440
the entire training yet, but I push it off

12
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,060
as much as I can, mainly because I wanna take people

13
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:29,160
through the whole process and I've experienced this before

14
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,400
when I hired my setter, she started getting familiar

15
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,560
with the process, she started hearing me pitch

16
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,040
and they would start asking her, they were interested,

17
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,920
if people are asking those questions, by the way, Juan,

18
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,280
those are really interested people,

19
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,860
those people are asking buying questions

20
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,320
and that's somebody that's a good look, okay?

21
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,080
They're asking the deal because they're internalizing,

22
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,640
could this be a good fit?

23
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:56,640
So, what you need to do is, what I train in the program

24
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,480
as I say, I say something to the effect of like,

25
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,240
hey, look, that's not even, that's way ahead

26
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,200
of what we're even talking about here.

27
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,200
Honestly, at this point, I just wanna get you

28
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,320
a couple of free leads and we can talk about that

29
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,880
in a couple of days, that's the easy part, ma'am.

30
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,400
Ma'am, that is the easy part, I've done it

31
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,480
and I always say something like, I've done everything

32
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,560
short of taking food stamps for payment,

33
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,760
knowing damn well that I won't do anything

34
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,400
besides flat feet, but I don't wanna get them all nervous,

35
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,480
I don't wanna get them thinking, oh, you know,

36
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,480
if I just say, oh, we do a flat feet,

37
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,360
all they're gonna do is they're gonna start thinking,

38
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,560
well, I don't like flat feet because it's not guaranteed

39
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,560
and I like to do paper lead and I wanna do a commission

40
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,000
and by the time you get to the call,

41
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,720
they're gonna come in and they're already gonna object

42
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,460
and they're gonna say, no, I don't wanna do a flat feet, okay?

43
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:46,460
But if you can shit on paper lead and commission

44
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,560
in that screencast right before you get on the call,

45
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,920
you're not gonna have any objections.

46
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,120
So, I just like to keep it open and let them think

47
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,720
that, you know, there's tons of options

48
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,040
and I'm really just looking to find the right person

49
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,620
before we talk about that.

50
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,300
Now, if they're ultra persistent,

51
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,040
which by the way, I've dealt with that before

52
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,520
and it just gets to the point where it's like,

53
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,480
you're gonna lose, they'll say, yeah,

54
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,200
we've done a couple of different things.

55
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,920
Most often, what works the best is doing something

56
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,600
that's on a flat rate, that way, you know,

57
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,320
your marketing budget isn't gonna soar up in the spring

58
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,200
when we get tons of leads and one thing I don't do,

59
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,840
by the way, is commission and I'll tell them straight up,

60
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,680
I'm like, the only thing I don't do is commission

61
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,240
and that's because you got no skin in the game

62
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,520
and I'll tell them straight to their face

63
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,800
because I will not do commission

64
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,520
and there's no skin in the game, that makes sense

65
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,520
and if they can't understand that,

66
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,360
I don't wanna work with that person

67
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,360
because they're stupid.

68
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,340
Commission deal is the most stupidest thing

69
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,160
on planet earth with paper lead stuff.

70
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,400
They have no care in the world to close a deal.

71
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,240
So, hope that helps one.

72
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,680
I do know it's in the training, but yeah, a recap,

73
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,920
just something, some kind of one-liner of like,

74
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,960
that's honestly, man, that's the easy part

75
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,800
of this whole thing.

76
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,620
I've done everything short of taking food stamps.

77
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,920
Let me get you a couple of these leads

78
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,180
and then a couple of days we can talk about it

79
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,240
if it ends up being a good fit,

80
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,360
but let's not put the cart before the horse,

81
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,480
something like that, okay?

82
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,200
Make it smooth, make it not a big deal,

83
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,920
but if it's persistent, just say something like that

84
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,840
and tell them why right there,

85
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,200
but you don't need to like go into tons of detail.
