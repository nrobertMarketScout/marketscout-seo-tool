Daniel says, I know you talked about 50 and lower on search volume, like 30 or 40.

00:05.440 --> 00:11.040
Yeah, Daniel, he's talking about the base bare minimum search volume.

00:12.320 --> 00:19.360
Guys, what I would say is that I would make sure at this point, and when I do

00:19.360 --> 00:23.680
version 3.0, when that's completed, I'm going to make sure that I'm very, very, very clear about

00:23.680 --> 00:28.800
this. But we're on here live right now. I would make sure it's 50 or above, especially if you're

00:28.800 --> 00:33.120
going after your first deal, because I don't want you guys to get in a situation where you get a

00:33.120 --> 00:37.120
deal, you hook them, or you get the deal, and then the leads kind of dry up, and you don't know how

00:37.120 --> 00:42.480
to navigate around the situation. So for me, if I get in that situation, I already know if I'm

00:42.480 --> 00:47.360
looking at a deal and it's like a 30 volume, 30 search volume, I'm going to tell them up front,

00:47.360 --> 00:51.360
like, hey, this is going to be a fluctuation. I'm going to really sell them hard and let them know

00:51.360 --> 00:56.400
it's going to be a variable volume amount of leads for the first couple of months, because

00:56.400 --> 00:59.600
I just have a feeling, whatever. I'm not going to say that, but I'm going to know.

01:00.240 --> 01:05.040
And I'm going to be able to kind of talk my way through those situations. If it's your first deal,

01:05.040 --> 01:10.320
it can become very scary, and it's like that deal is so important to you. So Daniel, my advice for

01:10.320 --> 01:15.120
you going for that first, second, third deal, go 50 or above. Make it simple.
