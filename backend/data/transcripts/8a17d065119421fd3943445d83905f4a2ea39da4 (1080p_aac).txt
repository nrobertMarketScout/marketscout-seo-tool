My advice, by the way, guys, if you guys are brand new and you have a campaign going and
it's like not hitting or you're waiting and the ads aren't consistent or it's not whatever,
go get a couple, go keep doing due diligence, get a couple of them up.
And then as soon as one starts to pop off, you can pause the other two, okay?
If an ad campaign is set up and running, but it's not getting impressions and it's not
getting clicks, or if it's not getting clicks, it's not costing you, okay?
So get a couple up and just make sure to watch it like a hawk so you don't go spend a bunch
of money that you don't have or that you don't want to spend.
And then you can pause them and just focus on the one.
