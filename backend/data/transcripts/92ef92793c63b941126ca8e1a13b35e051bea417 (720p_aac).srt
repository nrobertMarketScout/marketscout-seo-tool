1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,120
Jeff, what are the common things, most common things that you're seeing and let's, let's yeah,

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,160
what are the most common things you're seeing of why people are getting suspended? Let's start there.

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,640
Great. Well, so there are the, one of the common things that I'm seeing is,

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,760
there are several of them, but one of them is, is people are setting up

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,760
their MCC account and they're, and a lot of them are doing it like on their first time,

6
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,920
fresh Google ads, like first ad they've ever ran. And it seems like there's a lot of guys

7
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,680
that are missing a step. And I know not, I don't know if everybody has access to the 2.0,

8
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,480
but I've been referring, if you have access to 1.0, that's how you should be setting up your ad.

9
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:49,120
If you have access to 2.0, your video goes over that in really good detail, but I've kind of

10
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,000
referred them all back to say, go back through that and just really, really slow. And a lot of

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,800
what it is, I'll use the word like the hierarchy of how you set up an MCC account. So what some of

12
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:06,400
them are doing is they're setting up, and this is going to be one type of suspension that I'm seeing.

13
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,760
So some people that are setting up their ads, they feel like they're getting some running and

14
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,600
then they have to get that verification comes through. Then they go run their verification

15
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,240
and they can't get verified. And what's, what I'm seeing as a common theme with them is they set up

16
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,720
the MCC. So they set up their, I'm going to call it like their Google ad profile. Like they use

17
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,720
that Gmail to open up a Google ads and they do an MCC. And then they start running campaigns

18
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:36,000
directly underneath that. And if you go into the MCC, there's actually a spot where it says add

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,600
account. And you need to, before you run a campaign, you need to add an account that goes

20
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:49,040
underneath that, that goes inside of that or under, if this was like your Google ad profile,

21
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,520
you add an account here and then you add a campaign underneath that. And that's how like

22
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,800
the hierarchy of it should go. What's happening is people are setting up that, yeah, you got a

23
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:03,440
piece of paper. Yeah. Just what you're saying. It's like, yeah, by the way, real quick, for those

24
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:07,920
that are just brand new today, tell them what an MCC account, I know we're going very fundamental,

25
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,600
but let's just, what is an MCC account for someone that's like, what's that mean?

26
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:19,600
Well, it's, I would prefer people not do it until they have like 15 or 20 ads because it

27
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:25,520
gets confusing if you've never done it. But essentially it's, it's an account that you use

28
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:33,360
to manage quote unquote other people's ad accounts or you get brought on as a verifier. So like I run

29
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:39,120
a lot of Google ads for some political consulting that I do, and I will get added as the admin

30
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:45,760
or the manager for them. So my, my account will take over and has access to it. Basically it's

31
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:51,280
through a proxy that they give me. When you set up your own MCC and you set up the own accounts,

32
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:57,520
you can do that. But it, if you've never done one, it can be a little confusing for people.

33
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:06,160
Some people are setting up their MCC as a, like just like, it's like a solo account instead of

34
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:10,640
just doing an account. And on the right-hand side where your little profile picture is,

35
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,120
it's just adding an account, adding an account, add an account. They're kind of running the MCC

36
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,680
that same way. And that's not how that's supposed to be managed. So the MCC is kind of like the,

37
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:26,400
like the overseer of multiple ad accounts. Like I have multiple ad accounts for multiple clients

38
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:33,040
that are not related to each other at all. So guys, essentially if you guys like,

39
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:38,480
let's say it's your first time you go to Google ads. And I, and to my understanding, Jeff, maybe

40
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,280
you can correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think they ever just automatically give you an

41
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,560
MCC account. It's by default, they just give you a regular account, right? Yeah. You have to, yeah,

42
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,360
you do have to, I think I'm going to use the word apply for it. It's been so long since I've done

43
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,840
that, but I think you just hit it and you like kind of apply for it when you sign up initially

44
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,600
and you can apply for it. But that, that's kind of what's triggering some of these people's

45
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:07,040
verification issues. And because they didn't set up the MCC right, the way that it's the, they,

46
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,520
they don't have like the account and then the campaign, they have all the campaigns under it.

47
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:16,480
Well, that, that's supposed to be you like directly who you are. And you try to verify like

48
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:22,160
all of a sudden five or six websites. And it's like, Whoa, so the Google AI bot that's checking

49
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,880
it just goes, that looks weird. That's not, that's not who you say you are. Cause you all of a sudden

50
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:32,160
have five or six different like websites or properties you're advertising on. If it was

51
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,880
my property that I registered and I'm running direct ads for me, like say it for my business

52
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,680
and more my domain and everything would match. They might go, Oh, that makes sense. I get it.

53
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,720
You're running your own ads there. But when I'm running like concrete experts and you know,

54
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:53,280
outdoor kitchen or whatever, I have to set those up in a certain way so that it shows that my main

55
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,720
account is managing that accounts campaigns. Correct. That makes sense. So if you, if you go

56
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,600
in, you've never done ads and you go in, it's, you're going to just set them up. Like he's

57
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,080
talking about, because you're not going to have an MCC account, which is basically a manager account.

58
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:16,320
Once you, once you convert or apply for an MCC, all he's saying is guys, just make sure that with

59
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:22,960
each separate property, you guys create an account first as an additional layer. And then

60
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:28,960
you create the campaign inside of the account. And I saw Marie Marie just said like an umbrella.

61
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:35,280
It's exactly like that. It's kind of like this. Let's call the top layer is like a grandpa,

62
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:40,000
right? And then the accounts are your parent accounts. And then you have the child account,

63
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,040
which is the campaigns. So just make sure we're not skipping a step. And guys, with any of these

64
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:51,520
suspensions, here's how I look at it. You can get mad at Google all you want, but if I was Google,

65
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:56,720
I would do the same exact shit they're doing. Can you imagine somebody this randomly gets on

66
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,560
and they put in a credit card and let's say it's a word to get into this, it's a gift card or some

67
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:06,080
random card and they never spent any money. They have a brand new account. I don't know who you are.

68
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:12,880
I don't give a shit about your 20 bucks a day. I'm Google. I would much rather suspend you.

69
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,480
And then my thinking would be, well, if he's serious about this, he's going to hit me up.

70
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:23,840
He's going to reach out. He's going to appeal. And if he appeals, then we'll deal with it.

71
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,120
That's a way better because if not, if they just let everyone spend money,

72
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,680
now I'm complaining. We're dealing with the bank. We've got all these partners. So guys,

73
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,560
you get mad at Google all you want, but at that level, you would do the same exact thing.

74
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,080
So whenever you're doing something, think about it. Is this going to look sketchy?

75
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:45,040
Is this going to make Google think that I am somebody that's sketchy? Guys, a gift card that

76
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:50,240
has a finite amount of money on the damn card. Like if you were my client, I wouldn't let you

77
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,000
take, put a gift card in there. So why would Google? So that's number one, make sure that it's

78
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,160
set up properly. And I like the word Jeff used hierarchy. You got the MCC, then you got the

79
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,280
account, then you got the campaign. If you don't have an MCC, it's just going to be your regular

80
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,600
login. And then you're going to go straight into your, I think it's just straight into campaigns.

81
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,520
You can only have one, it's one account, right? Well, so you have like your, it's kind of weird

82
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,480
because Google doesn't do a good job of defining it, but like under your ad profile, let's say

83
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:25,520
whatever Gmail you use, then you set up a Google ad account. If you go back and hit that icon in

84
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,720
the top right, you can just add another account. You just hit add Google account and it kind of

85
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:36,080
sets it up very similarly to an MCC. Well, you have to log in and out of these different emails.

86
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,960
No, I mean, you can't set up that way. I have, I have multiple, I have like five emails that they

87
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:46,640
use. And I have the same, I have the same credit card on them. I have the same PayPal account on

88
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:52,240
them. Like, yeah. So you're almost creating an MCC account by without having an MCC account,

89
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,800
because you have these, you're separating them by different emails or whatever. Some, yes. I have

90
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:02,480
like kind of groups. And if you go back to like, if for the ones that, if the 2.0 training setting

91
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:08,080
up the MCC is confusing, if you go back to the 1.0, the original, I think it's module three,

92
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:14,240
you'll see how you set up a campaign there. You can follow that method and you'll, and that,

93
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,040
like that will be easier if you've never done it. And it's probably going to give less flags and

94
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:24,320
it's less opportunity for you to screw up. Like what is an ad? What is an account? What is a

95
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:29,680
profile? What is a campaign? And so I think that anyway, so that's something I would tell everyone,

96
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,480
just go back to those trainings if you have access to one or the other and just go slow.

97
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:39,440
And by the way, my thought process there, the reason why I used this new account is because

98
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,440
in version 1.0, we did it that way. So I wanted, cause other people were like, well, what about

99
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,400
when it's this way? So that, if you need to just access both, you get the training, you get this

100
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:54,160
1.0, 2.0 up till whatever point out. So that's number one. What's what else? What other other

101
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:59,280
things you're seeing? And that's it. So that, are you seeing that trigger a circumventing or a

102
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:07,040
suspicious payments? I think that one is mostly triggering verification suspension. So they're not

103
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:14,400
letting people verify. I believe there's been one or two policy violations that had set up their

104
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:19,760
campaigns wrong in that way. And that's triggering a, a, an issue.
