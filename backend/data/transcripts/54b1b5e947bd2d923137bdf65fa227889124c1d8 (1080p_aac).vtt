Okay, Eric says, I just asked this question in the group, but looking for input as well,

00:02.720 --> 00:06.640
what do you tell a potential BO to say to the customer that just called our Legion site,

00:06.640 --> 00:09.280
then called the BO's website and got the same person for both companies?

00:10.240 --> 00:14.720
I have an easy answer. What do you say, Kyle? Somebody calls the Legion site,

00:14.720 --> 00:17.280
then they're shopping for the second one, they get the same person on the phone.

00:18.320 --> 00:22.560
I just tell them that's a marketing site we have. She's like, oh yeah, we have a handful

00:22.560 --> 00:26.160
of marketing sites that all generate leads that funnel back to us.

00:26.160 --> 00:28.320
Here, I'll give you mine. Kyle, pretend that you're that person.

00:30.400 --> 00:31.600
Yeah, pretend you call me out on it.

00:31.600 --> 00:34.720
Yes. Yeah, this is Joe, Joe's Concrete.

00:35.280 --> 00:38.000
Yeah, I just talked to you from another site.

00:39.280 --> 00:44.960
Okay, yeah, that must be a sign. I mean, obviously, no, I would literally say something

00:44.960 --> 00:49.360
smartass like that. Like, yeah, no, obviously, we're the best company in town. That's why we're

00:49.360 --> 00:51.920
everywhere. But that's just one of our marketing sites. We have a couple of different sites.

00:52.800 --> 00:57.600
Just depends on what you search. How can I help? You ready to get that estimate done?

00:57.600 --> 00:58.400
Let's get this scheduled.

00:59.120 --> 01:00.560
Tuesday still work for you, bro.

01:02.480 --> 01:06.240
You want me to bring the frickin concrete when I come or you want me to wait? Okay.

01:07.040 --> 01:10.640
It's not a big deal. So to answer your question, Eric, this goes for any objection.

01:11.280 --> 01:16.640
That's not even an objection. If it's not a big deal to you, it's not a big deal to them.
