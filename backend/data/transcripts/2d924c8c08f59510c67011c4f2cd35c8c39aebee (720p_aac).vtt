Hey Nick, I have a question for you. So if I'm searching some, I've had this question a lot,

00:05.760 --> 00:12.240
so people are searching their keywords. Three of them are under $5, but then you get one that's

00:12.240 --> 00:18.000
like $10. What is your thoughts? Do you still go into that or do you? If it's your first deal, no.

00:18.880 --> 00:23.840
Okay, first deal? If it's your first deal, no. If it's your first, second, third deal,

00:23.840 --> 00:27.760
no. You want to follow it exactly. Even if there's one keyword that's creeping above,

00:27.760 --> 00:32.000
you're still going to run into problems. Now, why does it change if it's your third, fourth,

00:32.000 --> 00:36.480
fifth deal? Because now let's say it's your sixth deal, Porter, you know that, hey,

00:36.480 --> 00:41.440
in order for this to work, the CPC on that one keyword is double. I'm going to have to charge

00:41.440 --> 00:46.800
a minimum of like $2,000 to make the numbers work, right? But when it's your first deal,

00:46.800 --> 00:51.680
sometimes getting that $2,000 deal is a huge obstacle because you're like not used to asking

00:51.680 --> 00:59.280
for $2,000. Okay? So no, I'm saying stick to it exactly on your first few deals,

00:59.280 --> 01:01.600
and that's where you're going to find the goal. Cool.
