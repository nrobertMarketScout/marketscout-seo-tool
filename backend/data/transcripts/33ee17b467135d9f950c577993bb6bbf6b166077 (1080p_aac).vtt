I'm guessing you recommend Weebly for websites, right?

00:03.280 --> 00:05.720
Honestly, I don't think it matters.

00:07.240 --> 00:08.720
Some people have asked me this.

00:08.720 --> 00:12.240
I just, whatever you're comfortable with, whatever works,

00:12.240 --> 00:13.440
if you get a WordPress wizard

00:13.440 --> 00:14.960
and you can save a couple bucks, great.

00:14.960 --> 00:19.120
If you're like me and you just like easy, use Weebly.

00:19.120 --> 00:20.480
I know in some of these other groups,

00:20.480 --> 00:21.840
they have their own websites.

00:21.840 --> 00:24.000
My only advice is make sure that one person

00:24.000 --> 00:27.040
doesn't control your entire life that doesn't own you.

00:28.040 --> 00:30.680
But if you know which groups I'm talking about,

00:30.680 --> 00:32.960
I have some sites with some of those builders

00:32.960 --> 00:34.320
because I like to try them out.

00:34.320 --> 00:36.160
So I'm gonna be using Weebly though.

00:36.160 --> 00:37.840
I've made all my money on Weebly,

00:37.840 --> 00:40.680
but you can make money on WordPress, doesn't matter.

00:40.680 --> 00:42.080
But yeah, that's what I use.
