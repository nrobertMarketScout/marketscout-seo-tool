Guys the first deal changes everything and I mentioned this briefly in the last video

00:14.980 --> 00:20.260
but I just I don't think many people understand the power of getting that first deal and I've

00:20.260 --> 00:24.860
seen this with door-to-door sales rep I've seen this with students in this program I've

00:25.540 --> 00:32.260
myself the game is you've got to get the first deal and whatever you can do whatever way whatever

00:32.260 --> 00:37.220
website whatever it is that's gonna get you the first deal the quickest is the thing that you

00:37.220 --> 00:42.180
need to do because and and I shared this as well in the last video but the saying is hey

00:42.180 --> 00:46.420
when's the best time to get a deal when's the best time to get a sale after you got the last

00:46.420 --> 00:51.860
one because as soon as you get the first one mentally you're completely like oh that's it

00:51.860 --> 00:57.060
like that that's all it takes I got a thousand dollar deal all I got to do is a hundred more

00:57.060 --> 01:03.460
of those and I'm at a hundred K a month right and something something breaks open I don't know what

01:03.460 --> 01:08.780
it is I don't know how to describe it but something breaks open when this happens and you'll see it

01:08.780 --> 01:12.740
more often than not people will get their first deal and it might take them they might have been

01:12.740 --> 01:17.620
in a program for three years and got nothing they come into my program they get their first deal in

01:17.620 --> 01:23.140
three weeks four weeks two weeks and guess what their second deal they get three days later they

01:23.140 --> 01:28.020
get a week later they get two weeks later it's like okay what the heck it took you three years

01:28.020 --> 01:33.140
to get your first one and it took you six days to get your second one how does that work I don't

01:33.140 --> 01:38.460
know all I know is that momentum is a very powerful thing and when you get that first deal it's gonna

01:38.460 --> 01:44.020
break everything open it's gonna just remove these these mental chains that you have like I can't do

01:44.020 --> 01:50.060
this or ten thousand seems like a lot the second you get that first deal everything changes so

01:50.060 --> 01:54.580
whatever we got to do if that means you need to pre sell maybe you have a bunch of sites you're

01:54.580 --> 02:00.060
like oh I really don't you know as I talked about we got these sites and and you know I really don't

02:00.060 --> 02:04.220
want to be paying for this hosting and they're good projects whatever put them to the side let's go

02:04.220 --> 02:07.780
pre sell a deal and let's get that first one because if you get the first one and you get the

02:07.780 --> 02:12.100
momentum selling those sites down the road now that you have the momentum now that you have the

02:12.380 --> 02:16.540
money coming in and you're not so desperate you don't have that sales breath it's gonna change

02:16.540 --> 02:20.980
everything okay so I just want to stress to you the importance of as you're looking at this and

02:20.980 --> 02:26.900
as you're picking whether to go into a new project whether to use an existing site the game is how

02:26.900 --> 02:33.500
do we get our very first deal as soon as possible because when we once we do that everything changes
