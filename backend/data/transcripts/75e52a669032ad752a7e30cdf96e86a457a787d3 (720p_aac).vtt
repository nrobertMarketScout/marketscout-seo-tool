Charlie says, should I increase my targeting radius if I'm not getting enough impressions?

00:03.920 --> 00:09.520
My client said he can travel up to 60 mile radius. I would, but I wouldn't do 60 miles.

00:09.520 --> 00:14.880
I might do like 30 because they say that. But then guess what? As soon as the leads start freaking

00:14.880 --> 00:18.560
coming in, they're going to want to stay close to home. So yeah, I don't think there's anything

00:18.560 --> 00:22.800
wrong with bumping it out. But before you do that, Charlie, I would go and make sure,

00:22.800 --> 00:27.600
is the CPC under five bucks? Is the due diligence correct? Are you in the niches that I'm talking

00:27.600 --> 00:31.040
about? Are you in the cities that I'm trying to show you how to get into? Do you have the ad set

00:31.040 --> 00:36.960
up exactly? Are you running a smart campaign? Are you doing exactly as I trained before you go in

00:36.960 --> 00:41.040
and expand it? That's the only thing that I would say before you do it. But yeah, I don't see

00:41.040 --> 00:45.920
anything. That's a very minor thing. Maybe I start with, you know, from 15 to 20, then to 25 and to

00:45.920 --> 00:50.720
30, but don't go to 60. I'm just telling you from experience, you're going to go to 60, you're going

00:50.720 --> 00:55.520
to get more leads. And then he's going to go, ah, I'm getting, I just got this referral and like

00:55.520 --> 00:59.760
now I'm busy. I don't need it. And you're like, bro, I just spent all this money on ads, dude.
