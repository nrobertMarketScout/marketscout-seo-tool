Okay, that's gone through right on give me a second. Let me get out of this. I don't get

5
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,760
crazy notifications

00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:52,960
Okay, all right. Hey guys, uh, we're in all right good deal the zoom is open

00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:57,920
Yeah

00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:04,320
All right, man, you guys got questions. Come on zoom type them in the chat here and we'll get going. Okay?

10
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,840
Okay

11
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,580
All right, uh, well I wait for some people to hop in i'm just I got some notifications from last night

12
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,840
Oh, hopefully those guys are

13
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,120
Okay are hopping on good deal

14
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,080
Who we got there? Oh, hey josh, how's it going?

15
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,120
Good. How are you doing? Jeff? Good, man. Good. Good. How can I help you with?

16
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,720
Yeah, I would love your help on looking at these ads that i've got running

17
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,120
for a

18
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:09,200
Friend and a client at the same time. It's in the windows niche

19
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:10,800
and

20
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,800
installation or cleaning

21
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,040
installation

22
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,040
Yeah

23
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,880
so I

24
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,360
Picked him up as a just to help out with his

25
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,080
ads

26
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,720
Originally before I even jumped in this program. So looking at what it would look like maybe now

27
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,440
I probably wouldn't have jumped into this specific niche

28
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,520
Thankfully, it's it's still um, he's fronting the ad spin

29
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:41,360
so i'm not trying to do a lead gen for him just trying to help run this i'm trying to make it more efficient and

30
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,800
Help him bring more leads in getting some clicks, but we're just not getting many phone calls or conversions

31
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,240
So i'm assuming that some of the words that i'm targeting and maybe even the landing page i've got are not

32
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,360
With the best for conversions. So okay

33
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,340
You should be able to share your screen, I think I changed that setting, okay

34
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,520
All right, can you see my screen? Yes

35
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,240
Okay, great

36
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,040
So here's what we're looking at as far as the ads go

37
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
To the ads account

38
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,400
Yes, now I can

39
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:35,760
How long has that been running for what's the start date on that start date was uh, january 28th, okay, so about a month

40
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,840
Okay, good deal

41
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:43,360
And fort worth is how many people again? It's it's a big city, right? Fort worth is about

42
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,980
900 000 or maybe a million

43
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,280
Big ass city to be running campaigns. Okay

44
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,320
All right. What's your like daily budget?

45
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,440
Daily budget is sitting at

46
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,160
Going here real quick

47
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,480
I believe it's about 32 a day

48
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:08,400
Hmm. What's cpc for window installation? I would imagine it's bigger. It's pretty

49
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,160
it's

50
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:16,880
Probably over ten dollars. I'd imagine it can range. Yeah, it's usually about anywhere from 25 to 30

51
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,560
Or to 50. It can be even more than that depending on the city

52
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,200
I'm not i'm targeting different pockets the rural radius bubbles around three different counties

53
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:34,000
Which is a lot of area to spread through but trying to make it a little bit more specific to these certain cities that I think

54
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,400
That you could try drum up some business in

55
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,280
Okay. Yeah, two dollars a day

56
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:46,720
Okay. Yeah, and if something's like 20 you're not even yeah, okay, that's that's a big issue already. Okay

57
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,720
um

58
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,720
We'll go get into that. Um

59
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,200
one thing about the radius since you said that it's just

60
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,920
just be aware that like

61
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,400
You know, even if you do like a three mile bubble or whatever

62
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:05,680
Like that line that you see in the map like that's not like that doesn't like cut on a street or something any

63
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,600
Any zip code that that touches it runs adds to that whole zip code

64
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,520
So if you're in a big metro area and you're touching other zip codes

65
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:17,120
That could be an extra 100 000 people or whatever lives in that area

66
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:21,600
So it's just something to be mindful of sometimes in the bigger areas when you want to be specific

67
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,480
You're better off putting zip codes or like whatever those little mini cities are

68
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,280
Type of thing. Okay

69
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,240
Okay, I can see that as already being a big piece of it

70
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,880
Yeah, okay

71
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,680
Would you like me to show you

72
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,200
Yeah, go ahead. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to sidetrack you but I just when you said those things

73
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,880
I was like, let's just jump right into that because I know I love it. I can almost tell you that's that's an issue already

74
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,160
Yeah, so if I click into here you can see some of the the the locations

75
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,200
Right to see you what where i'm looking at

76
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,400
As soon as it loads that is

77
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,800
It's always slow and it's always slow in your own life. So don't worry about it. Okay

78
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,520
When it comes to those radiuses I can change them

79
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,320
I was doing zip codes for a minute and then realized like I have to double down on this

80
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,480
But I mean even Arlington's a humongous city

81
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:22,080
So a radius in a certain part of Arlington is not going to be nearly as effective like to your point

82
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,880
So these are these giant metro areas

83
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,600
Dude i'm working on

84
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,880
And yeah, you're probably running your ads to a couple million people

85
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,400
So I just need to I need to make it smaller a lot smaller or more precise

86
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:42,480
Yeah, and I mean, you know, I don't again whatever the cpc is that you're seeing like

87
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:49,360
I I don't really there's a whole window installation is not something for what we're teaching

88
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,240
As people shop for it, right they don't just go come over

89
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,480
So if you're going to run ads for it, it's a little more complicated than getting

90
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,640
Just kind of what we teach

91
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,600
But I would tell like

92
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,840
Without even looking at numbers like I would tell your friend you want to give me six grand

93
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,160
I'll do it. You want to give me eight grand? I'll do it

94
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,440
Other than that, that's a month. If not, i'm out

95
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:24,000
Got it. So and I that's just I don't even know the numbers. I could just think that that's what it would take

96
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,120
And that would maybe give you like fifteen hundred dollars and money to pocket

97
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,760
Yeah, okay. So that that's just off the top of my head

98
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,520
but um

99
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,640
it's like I had a client that is wanting to

100
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:46,240
Expand into like commercial roofing jobs, which is a whole different beast than like roofing

101
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,000
and

102
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,800
And I was like, okay

103
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,640
Well, you know and they where they live is not close to a metro area

104
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,960
And i'm like, I can't rank your website from where you're at into this metro area

105
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,720
Unless you want to give me some offices for google business profiles

106
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:07,440
Um, and I said if you want to run ads like that sale it's all about the sales cycle with these ads so like

107
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,320
You talk to your buddy about what's your sales cycle like like when you get somebody how many touches does it take for him to convert?

108
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,280
Now imagine no one even knows who the hell he is, right? So now it's like

109
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:25,360
This is this is the type of sales cycle where because window replacement is expensive

110
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,920
It's typically not

111
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:33,600
Unless you just want to do glass replacement for broken windows. That's something that you can maybe do what we do for

112
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:38,800
Right, but if that's not what he's wanting to get he's probably wanting to do big jobs, right?

113
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,800
Um is yeah

114
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:46,160
Okay, so that sale cycle is going to take multiple touches. So what we're what we teach here isn't going to be

115
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,360
As helpful for him

116
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,080
You're going to have to look at

117
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,880
Social media branding ads with retargeting

118
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:01,520
Facebook pixels display ads with retargeting from google and google search ads that we that we run

119
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,440
And basically he needs to be branded

120
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:11,600
He's going to need if someone's looking for him or that type of service and they come across his ad

121
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,240
Or his facebook thing you have to build multiple ads that will touch that person probably seven eight nine times

122
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,040
Before maybe they even come visit your site and that's why I said right off the top of my head

123
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,720
I'd be telling the guy

124
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,480
Six to eight thousand dollars a month minimum if he's not interested. I'm not interested

125
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,040
Because it's not worth my time or frustration

126
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,440
Yeah, and that's what it's felt like

127
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,680
It's been more of a frustration for me because I want to help him get some of these things going

128
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,680
But our budget is too tiny for these areas. He wants to and to your point

129
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,640
Being able to really retarget everybody once they've seen something first to be known

130
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,360
Is not happening, you know, so

131
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,320
Yeah, that's like the commercial roofer like this. He wants to do these things and then i'm like, I don't even know

132
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,440
I haven't even looked into it

133
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,360
But i'm like probably anywhere between six and ten grand a month if you want to do it

134
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,680
And you know, he's like, oh that's a lot of money and i'm like, well, that's what those it's

135
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,840
That's not you know, someone's gonna drop like a couple hundred thousand dollars on a roof job

136
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,720
Like they're not just searching google and clicking a button

137
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,840
You know, there's a whole branding to it. There's a whole like social proof to it like

138
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,800
i'm it's the same thing that nick talks about it's like

139
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:23,120
why we don't recommend kitchen remodeling or home remodeling things like that because

140
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,800
That's not something that somebody calls for someone to come do something simple

141
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:31,440
And and windows could be that way too because well what type of window?

142
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:36,320
What do I I want to you know, maybe the wife wants to come look at it and see it in a store and

143
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,520
You know, how does it open? What latch is it all those things? So it's a sale cycle. That's not like

144
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:45,200
Hey, my water heater broke or hey, I want to get my backyard

145
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,840
some concrete in it or

146
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:56,080
You know like emergency hvac repair like it's not something that's like a quick easy sale cycle like I need help now

147
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,160
type of thing or

148
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,160
This is such a lower

149
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,200
Like it's such a low cost item that i'm not really worried about

150
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,160
Like shopping around for the best best person

151
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,080
right

152
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:12,720
Yeah, so I I know that when I talked with this this friend of mine he was saying that his

153
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,680
Average cost is anywhere from six to eight grand for the windows job, right?

154
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,360
So that's usually what he would pay or get paid to do the windows

155
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,880
So in my head, I thought oh, that's a great like, you know, it's high ticket

156
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:31,200
But it's not I had to get over 15 grand like nick teaches. So you how do I move forward?

157
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,000
How do I best delineate between those two and know that i'm not getting into an industry?

158
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,320
That's just gonna like take my my breakfast and run with it. Yeah

159
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:48,480
If you're not familiar with like uh, like I mean this happens i've i've done this a lot and I'm kicking myself

160
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,560
like trying to help friends out

161
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,360
but um

162
00:11:54,160 --> 00:12:01,120
It's just kind of like just like if you don't understand the process like or what the niche is and you just need to ask if you

163
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,040
I get I look at it like this. I was like like I own a home

164
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,120
There's services that I need I kind of like think about

165
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:16,480
How would I find this person I might ask friends hey if you needed if I don't know i'll ask questions for like other people

166
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,120
um, or go on the chat groups and find like how do you do this or

167
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,920
You know, how would you find this person or whatever?

168
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,800
Um, and then sometimes it's the business owner. You just go. Okay. I hear you. I get it

169
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,640
Like what what's your typical sales cycles like like how does somebody find you?

170
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,840
How many times you have to talk to them like, you know, it's like that

171
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,040
We talk about qualifying them and you what's your close rate?

172
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,920
Like if I gave you 10 leads, how many can you think you'd close?

173
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,520
right

174
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,880
most people if I do 70 you're like bullshit, but if they're like

175
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,720
Yeah, I could probably close like, you know, four or five people. You're like, okay

176
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,280
a little more like that person might understand that there's a cycle to their business and

177
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,080
you know, not everyone's an amazing salesperson, but

178
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:05,360
It's those kind of questions. You just gotta you just gotta kind of qualify them better and more and understand like what?

179
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,960
Is there a sales cycle and then you got to think about what we're teaching and what we're trying to identify with

180
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,720
um

181
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,640
You know again, fort worth large ass area arlington large area

182
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,640
uh

183
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:23,040
You're running the just looking at that. I bet you're running that ad to like three million people

184
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,240
Nothing's working for 32 dollars a day at three million people

185
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:33,200
Yeah, like zero things are going to work for us on that. So you're going to get crappy clicks crappy leads

186
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,520
um

187
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,440
you have a pretty high impression count which

188
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:44,880
Could be possible, but I bet your display ads might be selected or google search partners. Maybe by mistake

189
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,120
That's that's something to think about

190
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:52,000
But again, just yeah, this is like, uh, this is something that's not really

191
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,640
What we would want to run here

192
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,320
Um, like I said, it's a multi-touch multi-branded

193
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,600
multifaceted different platforms retargeting

194
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,640
Website pixels like it's a more complicated

195
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,080
Basket that you're weaving the catch leads in

196
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,200
So if I if you were in my shoes

197
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:16,480
Would you go ahead and just make these ads like really specific to like one or two cities?

198
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:21,600
With those zip codes instead maybe in an area where the cpc is more in that line

199
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,800
That should be or would you just reach out to the owner and be like hey man

200
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,160
Like I just want you to know this is probably not going to be worth your time

201
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,480
Um

202
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:38,080
Yeah, I definitely would like get rid of the radiuses and target better spots

203
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,960
And see if you can make something work

204
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,400
But yeah, I would just not have high expectations for them

205
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,040
And I would also tell them you have the data to show you what cpc is

206
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,720
There's no reason to be at 32 dollars a day. That's not even one click

207
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:02,000
So you want to set yourself up for you know, how many clicks a day to win one click a day is going to do nothing

208
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,960
That's like having one customer walk into your door

209
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,280
If you were selling t-shirts

210
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:11,840
If you're at a store that you know sold clothing one person a day is not going to do it, right?

211
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:18,960
You need multiple people because not everyone's going to buy some are just browsing and leaving browsing and leaving but some people will buy

212
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,840
So you need a lot you need more people coming to you

213
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:28,000
If you look at it like a store you need to get more people to you and to do that with google ads you have to set

214
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:35,040
Up the appropriate daily budget and an appropriate monthly budget to allow you to even bring customers into the door

215
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:41,360
If you don't you're already just saying I don't want I don't want to make money here. I don't I don't want to have success here

216
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,480
So some of that's just being just looking at the numbers

217
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,200
And it's uncomfortable. I mean like this commercial this guy that wants to do commercial roofing

218
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,160
I know I know he's not going to but i'm not going to try to make it work for him for five bucks

219
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,800
Like you're out of your freaking school. I'm not doing that

220
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,680
I'm not going to put myself in that position make me look bad

221
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:05,440
Get friction with my friend or my client at all. I'm like, hey, no, this is what it's going to cost to do that

222
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,600
I don't want to like if you're not if you're not willing to invest that i'm not

223
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,840
Because now we're going to be in this spot where you have to like now go. Hey dude, this isn't working

224
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,160
and it's uncomfortable and it feels weird, but

225
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,040
That's just the nature of this like you just got to be

226
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,560
This is just maybe talk to more about a cell cycle

227
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:28,720
Maybe try to target a couple of those smaller like suburbs and just try to fish in there and make it work for him

228
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,840
But look at your numbers in your search volume and determine

229
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:36,400
What you think what you know a daily budget should be and a monthly budget

230
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,440
um, one of the things that i've talked about

231
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,560
before with people is like

232
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,720
This is like this isn't like a rule like that you can like you'll find on the internet

233
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,880
I'm sure there's people that have different opinions on it

234
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:54,080
But like for me when i'm not sure and i'm like, well, I don't know. What's the daily budget going to be?

235
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,800
What's the monthly budget what I like to do is I like to take

236
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,440
the search volume

237
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,080
From like what I find in rare keyword planner

238
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,480
the monthly search volume and I add that up and then

239
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,320
Um

240
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:12,640
I add that number up and then I divide and then I find like 75% of that

241
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:16,880
And and the goal and so the thought is that well, I want to try like like I said

242
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:20,880
I want to bring customers into my door to buy my t-shirt. I need to get a lot so

243
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:27,600
Out of a hundred people that walk by my store. I want to get like 70 75 of them in my store. Does that make sense?

244
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,200
So that's so that's where that number comes from and it's just a number

245
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,440
I just it just seems to work and then I look at my my uh,

246
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,360
My top of page my highest bid cpc and then I multiply those two numbers together

247
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,440
That should give me a monthly budget and then I divide that by 30

248
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:50,400
And there and there's your and there's your daily budget and if you set them up like that

249
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:57,440
That's an easy way you can you can dive in and tweak things and get rid of fort worth and you know

250
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,200
You can make that smaller

251
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:04,800
But like but you're always going to do it with data and a little more confidence and then by doing it that way

252
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,200
Even if the friend's like, oh, that's too expensive cool

253
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,960
Not my problem. That's not my problem. If you don't want to spend money to make money, that's not my problem

254
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,200
That's a you problem. Not me problem, right?

255
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:23,120
Hey jeff. Yeah, can you can you go through that formula again? My my laptop cut out when you were saying it. Nope

256
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,320
Just kidding. Thanks a lot

257
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:31,600
You being late you owe me one you're late. I know I was on the phone

258
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,640
Whatever multiple clients this morning are like i'm like I got it

259
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,360
Yeah, so I take the the total number of search volume

260
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,480
And I i find like 70 75 percent of that number

261
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,600
And then I take my top of page bid

262
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,960
Okay, I multiply those two numbers together that gives me what the monthly budget would be

263
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:59,440
And then divide that by 30 just to say average 30 days a month and that will give me a daily budget to shoot for

264
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,520
And then I could tweak it from there

265
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:08,480
Like he's gonna have a huge daily budget and monthly budget with that many people he's running ads to

266
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:12,400
So I can now go well, let me just work on

267
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:18,880
Decatur texas. Okay, that's gonna be this much. Let me just work on mineral wells, texas

268
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:24,880
That's gonna be this much like then I can like bring my I can maybe think make things work a little bit better for me

269
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:30,560
If i'm trying to like get my own clients and like, you know, get my own leads and sell them to somebody

270
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,960
It's it helps

271
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:39,120
You know that formula will help you find these smaller areas and set yourself up for success in them, too

272
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,040
So that way you don't go i'm gonna do a window installation business outside of fort worth

273
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,640
And you're like i'm spending like 50 a day and i'm getting nothing

274
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,120
And when you run the numbers, it's like you should be doing

275
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:55,600
290 a day and you're like, oh my god, i'm gonna go bankrupt doing that. So so that that formula is more for us

276
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:01,280
But because you're because you like you're putting your own money out there first trying to get a business owner

277
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:06,640
But like in your case, you're you're trying to help a you know, a friend who is a business owner

278
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,960
so I kind of use that same formula just to like

279
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,440
Just to even know where I need to have that conversation out because right every business owner

280
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,920
not everybody a lot of business owners are like

281
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:23,360
Especially if they haven't done digital advertising and or they've been burned or whatever it is like I just want to do this

282
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,560
And spend five dollars

283
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:29,120
Why can't you why can't you make me millions of dollars if I give you five dollars and you're like, yeah, bro

284
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,960
It doesn't it doesn't work that way

285
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,800
so if you use that data

286
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:38,400
It just gives you a place of authority and then if there's like a conflict in the conversation you could be like here

287
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,120
Pop on a video boom. This is what google's telling me

288
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:45,120
What do you what do you i'm not lying to you? Like you can kind of have a little bit

289
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,320
of authority and and um

290
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,800
Just kind of like more of that expertise that like i'm using data to drive this

291
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,280
I don't if you don't want to do it. That's cool, but

292
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,320
I'll find the next guy that wants to make money

293
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,200
But use the data to your advantage

294
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:06,960
It gives you more confidence to demand money from a guy at a certain amount that you might feel uncomfortable with

295
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,360
Because you're like i'm looking at data

296
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,240
This is what this is just what it's going to cost me in advertising dollars

297
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:15,200
I'm not even talking about what I want to put in my pocket, right?

298
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,520
So at least then when you speak you speak from a better position of authority

299
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,000
Or and you have a better expectation if this is you were doing this on your own

300
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:30,640
You can be like, okay. I'm gonna burn like 75 bucks a day this and that but it looks good low-hanging fruit

301
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,080
I'm gonna make some money

302
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,040
Okay, i'm it looks like i'm gonna spend say two grand a month

303
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:40,160
So I want to sell this deal for four thousand dollars or 35 whatever it is that you want to try to set

304
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,360
But now at least even if you're spending more money per day

305
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:49,920
You have a better expectation of like what you need to get for it to make it worth your while and that's big, too

306
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:55,200
Rather than like oh, can we just do a thousand dollars a day and then you're like I lost money

307
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,400
Right. So like by doing that you set yourself up

308
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,400
To decide if you want to go into a niche or not or an area or not

309
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:07,280
And then you also give yourself that that expertise and that authority to make a better decision

310
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:13,600
And to make sure that you know what to sell it for to make money and that's probably more important than

311
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,520
how much it's gonna cost and all that other stuff is like

312
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,240
you know, because there's places i've gone into where i'm like

313
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:26,400
Like this is gonna be expensive. But damn if I hit i'm gonna make like seven grand on this

314
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,640
You know, like I can make some really good money or I can get into a revenue deal with the guy

315
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,040
you know

316
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,320
so

317
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:40,480
Yeah, that's really helpful. And I think that that's the the way to go about it with the best metrics for success

318
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,560
You know, you're planning for

319
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:47,760
Success not just randomness. Yeah. Yeah, just use the data and it's new. I get it

320
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:52,160
Like you're not you just that's probably your biggest issue here. It's just it's not a high budget

321
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,320
You're running it to probably several million people

322
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,160
and and as a niche it's not a

323
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:06,640
It's not a it's not a like one and done type of service it's typically a multi-faceted multi-touch deal

324
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,240
Okay, yeah

325
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:16,480
That's helpful then I'll work on uh narrowing down the cities a little bit more and just having an honest conversation with him

326
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,800
Yeah, my numbers and then also look at the overall budget for that too

327
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,960
Um, and that'll give me to a good spot. Do you can I show you?

328
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,680
Um the site that i'm driving traffic to as well so you can kind of let me know

329
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,400
if you would add some components to it or

330
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,080
Uh, yeah. Yeah if you want

331
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,840
This is what it looks like right now not mobile

332
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:49,040
He is an interesting window contractor I was gonna say that's cool that you have that uh-huh. Yeah, you have your types of windows

333
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,800
We also do door upgrades but that's just not part of the ads right now

334
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,960
And then quote from the bottom

335
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:01,200
Yeah, I mean it seems like a simple landing page for people

336
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,040
Yeah

337
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,000
Yeah

338
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,040
Great

339
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:09,600
Well, i'll go and stop sharing my screen if um, todd wants to jump in here with his questions, but thank you jeff

340
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,920
I appreciate your help. Yeah. No problem. Good luck

341
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,760
Thank you. All right. Yeah

342
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:20,500
Hey todd, how's it going? Good. Good. Hey, can I share my screen? Yeah, absolutely

343
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,520
Uh, oh you again

344
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,480
Let me see if I can find the right screen here we go

345
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,520
all right

346
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:38,800
And then todd before you get going let me because when i'm streaming sometimes things um

347
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,200
Things don't work on the desktop. Let me just make sure no one's leaving comments on the facebook thing

348
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:48,080
Just give me one quick second. I'm sorry. No worries

349
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,200
Just it doesn't uh, yeah

350
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,360
Yeah

351
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,240
Let's see here

352
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:07,680
All right, let's see. There he is. Okay. Yeah jason will you cover negative keywords again?

353
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,880
Jason you covered got my own feedback

354
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,840
um

355
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:20,720
Yeah, jason, just remind me i'll do that. I'll try to cover this. Okay. Sorry todd. Go ahead

356
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,760
No worries. So this is the uh, the site i'm

357
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,920
Been running ads to the last month and again, this is my first the first

358
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:31,600
With this group. Um, and then this was the thing that I posted

359
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,480
um, yeah, okay, so base

360
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,000
Basically, I think what i'm trying to find out is is volume

361
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:43,440
So that's what all this is. These are just screenshots of the volume for all these different sites that I have

362
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,600
Uh, okay. So those different sites didn't show up on that sheet. That's why I was like i'm not sure

363
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,920
Yeah, I didn't want to I didn't want to you're fine. No, no, you're totally fine. It was just like i'm not

364
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:58,160
Fully, I wasn't just what you showed was not making me fully understand what the data was. I was like, yeah

365
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,960
No, no worries. So this one line four. This is that avondale tree service

366
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,680
Um, that's yours

367
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:08,880
This is mine. Yeah, okay. And so so what i'm i'm

368
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:14,400
Again, I think I think my issue with this is I picked one of my sites that has really low

369
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,200
Not low but lower

370
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,600
Called volume. I mean mangos only shows 10

371
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,720
4 000 impressions

372
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,200
Um, and then the ad itself

373
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,640
Looks like this

374
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,760
And again, it's only been since

375
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:41,680
What yeah, you're you're just out of that first two week thing anyway, so that's not yeah, sometimes that's part of it too

376
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,360
Sure, the first week is always terrible

377
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:52,160
Second week, it can get better third fourth week. It should keep getting better if you make the right adjustments to it. So, okay

378
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:57,200
Okay, so i'm looking yeah looking at 16 clicks over the 384 impressions

379
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:02,080
So basically again, i'm I should just keep it. It just needs to season more it sounds like

380
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,640
Yeah, and like the first week it's like it could be just complete dog crap

381
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:12,480
That's why we're like to talk because like the first two days is policy then after that it goes to this learning phase and

382
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:17,840
It'll try to run your ads at a whole bunch of different things and it's testing it out and that's where you know

383
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,680
you need to go in and like

384
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,960
Maybe put things to you know

385
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,440
Go review your search terms and go things to the negative keywords and that's you

386
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,360
Helping google train what you want your ad to kind of focus on and then you can make improvements to headlines

387
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:36,240
Whatever it is that you want to do and then that's where that second week now is like a week of that

388
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,840
You kind of do the same thing and typically after two adjustments

389
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:46,960
Most you're you're kind of pointing in that right direction and then beyond that it's just fine tuning it really

390
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,280
Okay, um, so that's why I always say it's just the first two weeks are just kind of like

391
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:56,160
I always tell business owners like hey man, the first month is not going to be awesome

392
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,760
I'm just going to be straight with you

393
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,360
The first two weeks are completely out of my hands because that's just google doing google

394
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:06,400
um, and i'm going to do this and this and we'll start seeing things the third fourth week and

395
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,680
That almost always works and when that almost always works

396
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:14,800
I've established myself as authority and expert and then we're good. We're great sailing from there

397
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,120
Okay, okay

398
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,000
So then yeah

399
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,760
And then the other question I had is is it typical that because cpc when I first started was like 490 or something

400
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,760
It jumped up to 839

401
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:34,480
Um is i'm assuming that's kind of typical right that it fluctuates or yeah, especially in trees trees will have a wild swing

402
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:40,480
Yeah, and it's weird that you think like oh, it's the winter time and it gets more expensive in the winter time

403
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,000
And then it dips and then it gets more expensive again

404
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,600
Like late spring sometimes I think is when it gets it gets again

405
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,280
And because right now is the time

406
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,200
well, they pretty much should be finishing that up, but they should have been all of the

407
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:03,920
Major trimming and everything else they wanted to do during the winter to set the trees up for a good spring, right?

408
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,280
so

409
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,600
That's why some costs go way up in the winter

410
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,840
Yeah, because i'm i'm also I have this site over here. Um

411
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:20,160
So this one's local to me would be that's the towing woodbury tree care now mango shows a volume of 80

412
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:25,440
It's a little bit higher in cpc right now. And again, it's up here in minnesota. So we're just getting into

413
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,920
Well, you guys also have trees up there

414
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:33,600
Yeah a lot. In fact, yeah, it's like okay. Are you familiar with arizona like where avondale is?

415
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:40,320
I grew up in uh, yeah, I started planting a church in buckeye. Yeah, okay. So yeah, i'm from tempi

416
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:45,200
I'm from tempi. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So that's going to be an issue with arizona, right?

417
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,920
It's going to be residential people with their trees and

418
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:51,280
Yeah, so you're you're not going to have as many

419
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,120
People just by the fact that they just don't have

420
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:00,080
You know people don't typically have big ass shade trees out there, right?

421
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,200
Right, yeah

422
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:07,920
And so this one is like I said, it's local up here in minnesota and it's again mangles has it higher cpc is a little bit higher

423
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
but the volume

424
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:15,680
Should last last season. I didn't have any ads joining to it. It was just you know, it's number one

425
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,840
It's on page one of google

426
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,360
And I had a couple of

427
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:25,760
I had a couple of calls coming in monthly never was able to lock anybody down

428
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,200
So considering doing this for the season

429
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:35,280
Running some ads to get this one boosted. I have two business owners that said talk to me next year

430
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:42,240
Yeah for that for that site. So so so that page one rank that those are your sites ranking on page one

431
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,720
Yeah, yeah, like

432
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,000
Yep

433
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,520
Like all my towing sites are in the map pack and those are all sold already. So that's great. Good job, man

434
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,080
Yeah, I would say then like

435
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,720
One oh good the what go ahead

436
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,000
I was gonna say like for that avondale one like I would just really

437
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,960
If it's really that low search volume and you're on page one and you're ranking for big terms

438
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,440
Like I just keep going for the organic play there and I wouldn't waste my money

439
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:16,400
Personally, if i'm ranking one on like multiple keywords or in the map pack for things that to me would just be like

440
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:21,520
Well, i'm my stuff's already there. Why do I need to keep paying for it? Right?

441
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:28,160
Yes, this is me right here. Yeah, I would just maybe try to work on getting some more reviews to it

442
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,520
Yeah, but look at number three same thing

443
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,480
um, so I yeah, I would I I think you're

444
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:39,280
Yeah, that's what I that would that's why I would put my time and money into it

445
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:43,040
just to try to rank it for other keywords in the area and

446
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,480
Just it's either gonna get clicks or not

447
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:51,200
Yeah, so maybe that low search volume it's just gonna save you money

448
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:58,800
Yeah, that's that's where i'm at right now. So i'm i'm really leaning toward really kicking into that tree this this tree care

449
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,400
one

450
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,400
because that's that's uh

451
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,440
um

452
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,560
Hold on

453
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,640
I

454
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:19,120
Think i'm in map pack there too. Yeah, that's right here number one and organic. It's awesome. Yeah. Yeah

455
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:24,480
Yeah, you're not quite in the map pack there but you're number one that's pretty good

456
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,800
Yeah, pretty much all all my tree care ones are my towing for sure

457
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,960
They jump really quick into map pack

458
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:36,080
But yeah, so I would just like just try to get those things to rank in some more keywords

459
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,560
Try to get that gmb up

460
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:41,360
And I make for the one that has a search volume of 80

461
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:46,080
That's one where if I know i'm doing really well organically and I can get the map pack up

462
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:52,640
Maybe what I do is just be really selectful with what keywords I want to run my ad to maybe not be as broad

463
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:56,960
And maybe be a little more specific even including exact match keywords

464
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:03,360
And that way i'm really and and what I could be doing then is like buying more real estate on page one

465
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:10,080
So you'll see my ad you'll see my site or you'll see my google business profile and you're going to see my like

466
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,720
I just own three spots of what 12?

467
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,600
Yeah, 13 maybe depending on how they're displaying it. It's pretty damn good odds

468
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:22,560
That you'll get some clicks that way. So that's something that you can supplement really good seo with

469
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,120
Especially if you know there's value to it

470
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,800
Okay, yeah

471
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:33,280
Yeah, and that and that will help reduce your overall ad spend and make it work in a in a better way

472
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,400
for you

473
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,680
Right. Okay. So just just to recap probably

474
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,560
um

475
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:46,400
Folk get more reviews on the avondale tree service and then the other tree service one run a couple of ads

476
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,640
keyword specific

477
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,920
Mm-hmm

478
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:54,080
I think and I also i'm trying to get break into the concrete world, but uh,

479
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,360
I got to do more due diligence on that. So, okay

480
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:02,960
Yeah, yeah, thanks. Yeah. Yeah, no problem. Uh, yeah keep it out. You're doing great on the seo stuff

481
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:07,840
That's that's the long-term play right? Yep. So yeah, I think that's the long-term play

482
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:12,320
The ads thing is great to get it going fast and also to like when things are slow

483
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,440
You can supplement with ads and like again, it can just get you

484
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,200
You know like a nick talks about in the sales about you know, it's like just it's about monopoly, right?

485
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:25,680
The best way to the best chances of winning the game and monopoly is owning the most properties on the board

486
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,000
And yeah, that's exactly what I was just saying

487
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:34,000
You just you can really be specific about certain jobs that you want certain types of services that you want

488
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,440
You can run them on top of where you're already ranking number one for

489
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,480
Um, but you can use the ads and you can be very specific on the keywords that you select

490
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:47,040
Including just doing exact match and you're you could just be like

491
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,680
Okay, i'm not doing really good on like say commercial tree services and I want to do that

492
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:55,120
So i'm going to run ads just there and maybe i'll get a job here and there from it

493
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:56,480
Cool, yeah

494
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,480
Uh, or I want to boost tree removal

495
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:04,000
And so i'm going to run an ad for that for this month and let it sit on top of my organic rankings

496
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,480
And now I got three freaking shots at getting someone to click on my stuff

497
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,360
Yeah, that's pretty that's pretty dang cool

498
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,800
Okay

499
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,120
Thanks, man. Yeah, no problem. Great job

500
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:20,480
Uh, I think I saw Janelle next I see your hand up

501
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,880
Hi jack, hi, how you doing?

502
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,880
We're back

503
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,880
You're back. Yeah

504
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:32,880
Um, well, thanks. It's good to be on here again and I will try my best to keep it concise. Um

505
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:38,640
We uh have that it's a similar the same business owner. We were talking about before

506
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:43,520
So just to recap we had new work tree service three. We have california, right?

507
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:47,760
So because we already picked that um, and we have a paying business owner and he's working with us and all that

508
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:53,280
Working with us and all that. Um, but we got a much bigger budget this time from him is willing to pay more

509
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,040
um

510
00:35:55,040 --> 00:36:02,800
We're not running ads on new work tree service. We created two other websites for him danville and castro valley location, which are near us

511
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:07,040
New work's the only one we've been able to get a gbp on or gmb on

512
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,840
Um having a lot of trouble with gmb's lately

513
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:16,960
I don't know if everyone else is experiencing this in the last three months, but it's been auto suspensions appeal denials like everything

514
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,720
um

515
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,720
So just haven't gotten one to go through in a while

516
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,800
um

517
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:29,040
So we are now running an ad to castro valley tree service to that site for him. It's one of the newer sites

518
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,600
um, and

519
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:37,520
I just have some questions about the campaign and i thought I was just saying like i'd love to see your um

520
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,760
Some of your keywords if you wouldn't mind sharing because the click through it. It's brand new

521
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,440
We just launched a week and a half ago and I know it takes a couple weeks

522
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:49,280
But um, can I share with you and show you my screen on what we're seeing?

523
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,360
Absolutely

524
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:51,920
All right

525
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:57,200
And then the other thing is I get a little lost because I I think I created too many mcc's and so it's

526
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:01,600
Kind of having a hard time figuring out which is which so i'm sure I did it wrong

527
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:08,160
And then it's telling me that one of my accounts needs to be verified, but I don't think it's the one that's running

528
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,640
Um this this ad

529
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,600
Um, it's got a different account number

530
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,960
Okay, so let me see if I can find it really quick so castro valley tree service

531
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,640
Gosh, sorry. It's gonna just do this whole thing. Um

532
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,560
And then we got like

533
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:31,520
It stopped running our ad two days ago and it said something like we we had reached the max

534
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,160
Threshold or something and it only charged us 18 dollars and 20 cents

535
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,440
Um, and I was having a hard time finding where to do the payment

536
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,120
Um, and we've set our max budget to fifty six dollars and sixty six fifty six sixty six a day

537
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:50,400
Um, and I was kind of in line with what google was recommending. It wasn't the high end and it wasn't the low end

538
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,080
It was like right there

539
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,920
um

540
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,400
So it's telling you that it was like limited by budget

541
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,800
It said something about my threshold had been exceeded

542
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:07,120
So I put through a ten dollar payment or 18 20 18 20 and it looks like it's back up, but it wasn't

543
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:15,360
Right, like i'm still let's see. Hold on. You might have put a cap on it. Maybe like some people put like a monthly budget on it

544
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:20,880
Okay, if I did I didn't know that I was setting that up and yeah, I mean may not have I just

545
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:27,280
Yeah, what you're saying i'm trying to I can't remember last time I even saw something like that. So like it's not

546
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,640
Yeah, it was a weird thing at the top and I was like, what is this name?

547
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:35,920
Uh, it wasn't a big balance. So it looked like so that was the day like shut off. We got nothing

548
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,680
and then

549
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,080
Um, it's picking back up and let's see you started

550
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:45,360
You started it that could have just been a click, uh, a glitch in the matrix, too

551
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:51,360
I've had like i've woken up to like alerts that like this got suspended and that and I go on and i'm like

552
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:57,360
It's all there. I don't know what the heck that was like i've had weird like I just call them glitches in the matrix sometimes

553
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,880
Okay

554
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,880
Um, so we have gotten one call yesterday for this ad

555
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:07,680
But obviously not expecting to see much and it does look like I didn't see it today, but it looks like it's picked up

556
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:12,400
Um yesterday, so we got 14 clicks. I'm not using a lot of keywords. Um

557
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:16,400
I tried doing some negative keywords our score on optimization

558
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,000
I tried doing some of your old stuff that I saw like where you could say skip and skip

559
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,000
Doesn't let you do that anymore. Like it actually wants me to do this stuff

560
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:29,200
Really? Yeah, it wants me to do callouts. It wants me to do that. I do that all the time

561
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,840
It sends them back to you, but I just get rid of them

562
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,840
So it wants me to do conversion tracking dads. Nope. Do not do that

563
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:41,280
I know you guys will you just hit dismiss just tell it to piss off. They'll cut it. They'll

564
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,760
They're always going to try to make money from you. Just hit this

565
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:50,480
Just hit it. Yep. Bye. Okay back. They'll bring it back in a week. Big deal. Bye. Okay. I didn't see the dismiss. Thank you

566
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:56,640
And then should I be doing site links on ads? Do you recommend those? Yeah, it helps add some more

567
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:01,680
Um real estate to the ad if you have a full page if you have a one pager, no

568
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,320
Yeah, we have a one pager. Yeah, yeah, then you're not going to be able to do it. So don't do it

569
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:12,000
Okay, and that was a question that I had about the ad we're just doing one campaign one ad group

570
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:19,760
But it's tree service. So I was wondering do you think we should do an ad group for tree removal an ad group for tree trimming an ad

571
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:23,040
Group for like the different keywords or just keep them all in one

572
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:26,480
Um, what's what's the population you're running this to?

573
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,120
140 oh, let's see castro valley. I can't

574
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,040
65 000

575
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:42,960
Okay, are you running a radius or just a casserole just castro valley right now?

576
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:46,320
But we got a call from union city yesterday, which is a neighboring city

577
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,120
okay, so

578
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,160
And this is right along the bay, right?

579
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,840
Yeah, we're in the bay area. Um, it's near oakland

580
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:01,760
Yeah, but uh, let's see. So there's like union city and castro valley

581
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:06,160
San lorenzo san liandro some of those other areas

582
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,840
Uh, wait, oh, that's actually oakland castro

583
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:16,320
No, it's next to oakland. It's next to oakland. Okay. Yeah, I think my sister used to live. Oh, yeah

584
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,960
No, no, my sister lived just north of that. Sorry. Okay. Yeah

585
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:25,440
Okay, so I would okay so

586
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,880
65 000 people that's fine. I I don't think you need to run different ad groups

587
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,600
If you're in a more populated area, yes

588
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,660
That's part of the reason why we say don't do california

589
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,680
Because you have to set up more of an expert ad

590
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,120
Yeah

591
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,080
Okay

592
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:46,640
Does the optimization optimization score do anything for your ad or is it just

593
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:51,840
It doesn't always have to stay at 100 but yeah the higher it is the better it is just

594
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:55,840
If you go like if you go to the left and hit recommendations, that's going to tell you

595
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,040
All the stuff they recommend at the top left dish

596
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:05,120
Okay, hold on top left column. Yeah, you'll see or it says overview recommendations and site reports. Yep

597
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:10,240
Yeah, it was like call outs and site links and yeah, so I think it's important

598
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:14,240
so call outs what they're trying to get you to do with not call outs but like

599
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:18,480
Setting the conversions like people that go to like ctas and all that

600
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:23,360
That is a guarantee. They are going to spend all of your money every day

601
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:27,680
They're going to do it. You if you want to do that, that's great. But like

602
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,960
Even if I set an ad up for seventy five dollars a day

603
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:36,400
um, I typically don't run seventy five dollars a day unless i've like

604
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:41,600
Massively misjudged it but if I do if I set it up to do the conversion

605
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,880
It it'll always run my seventy five dollars a day

606
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:48,640
So that's kind of I don't really recommend doing it for what we're doing

607
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:55,120
Yeah, so yeah, you can just go here. You can just dismiss it hit the three dots hit dismiss watch your ad score go up

608
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,520
Okay, cool. Um

609
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:02,160
Like any of the recommendations, yeah, i'll just say oh I can just do dismiss all

610
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,160
I'll do it later

611
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:10,000
Yeah, okay. It's going up. Okay. I'll play with that later. I'll just just dismiss everything

612
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:14,800
Um, do we want just to save you a step you see the three dots next to the 4.3?

613
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:22,480
Yeah, click that just dismiss all and then hit dismiss. There you go. One less click for you to do. Okay. Okay

614
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,840
Um now any of these recommendations that we should actually do

615
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,160
Um, no, okay

616
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:31,360
All right

617
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:32,240
and then

618
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:36,640
Can I just especially not if you don't have like a if you just want to if you're running to one page or no

619
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,040
When you start getting to adding a full website

620
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,320
adding site links and call outs can be

621
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:47,840
Helpful in the fact that your ad might take up more real estate on certain displays

622
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:54,480
And if they give you more real estate to display your ad that typically means one more person's ad isn't going to show

623
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:59,520
So there's a tactical advantage to it. Is it necessary? Absolutely not

624
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:04,080
If you want to go through the hassle of it, you're more than welcome to it's not a negative thing

625
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:08,640
but you don't do it with a one pager because you don't have the urls for it, but um,

626
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:14,260
It's more of a real estate game than it is about like getting more conversions

627
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:19,520
Yeah, and we'd probably have to create different landing pages for each keyword and we have them all on one right now. So

628
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,440
just simpler

629
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,760
um, we don't have a ton of

630
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:27,200
keywords, but I just put some of the top ones and I've

631
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,440
um

632
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:33,040
This is not the keywords I picked. I don't know. I had like only seven

633
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,440
and then

634
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:39,040
Overview will show me what people are searching right if I look down here

635
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,640
Top searches

636
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:43,680
um

637
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,680
And then keywords

638
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,680
So I did

639
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:52,080
I I haven't done the negative keywords in a while, but I did put how to diy

640
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:58,480
Free all that stuff some of the brand name tree services are like, you know the big business

641
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:03,440
Yeah, can you leave this here for a second? I'm gonna i'm gonna scroll on a second tangent

642
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:06,080
So for jason who asked this question earlier

643
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:12,320
When we're looking right here, you can see in the negative keyword list. You can see how some of them are exact match

644
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,960
Some of them are broad match. Um

645
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:18,880
I if I remember correctly, there's no phrase match. Um

646
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,760
Negative keywords nor do you want that?

647
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:28,080
And the difference is that when you go to your search terms and you see a search term like anr tree service anvil tree service

648
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:31,520
And you select it and you say send to the negative keyword list

649
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:35,040
That's that term goes over as an exact match

650
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:40,080
Versus here where she typed in diy do it yourself

651
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,640
For free how to

652
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:48,960
Those things will go in it. You can select broad match or exact match. So hopefully that answers your question jason. Okay

653
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,040
Sorry, thank you

654
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:54,320
While you're here, I just thought I didn't want to ignore his comment. So of course

655
00:45:54,800 --> 00:46:00,400
Yeah, everyone has like a lot of the same questions and stuff. So yeah, okay, so that's good

656
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:03,600
So you've you've gone through your search terms. That's great. That's what you need to do

657
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,760
um

658
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,760
Yeah, I I do wonder

659
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:12,640
If um, let's see you have you see it's

660
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:16,080
Saying not eligible my campaign is paused

661
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,400
Uh-huh

662
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,400
okay, so okay where it says

663
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:26,400
Sorry where it says like uh add callouts to your account all that like get rid of that

664
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:32,640
That window or whatever you want to call it there, yeah, okay, so you're looking at all campaigns right now

665
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:36,960
So you had two campaigns you had one that's paused one. That's not okay

666
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:41,280
So if we want to yeah, that's all if you want to go to the one that's running just just uh, no

667
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Don't do that. I don't want that one

668
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,400
It's fine. It's not doing anything. Just leave it there

669
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:51,360
I i'm not a big fan of deleting stuff on google ads. So just leave it just hit pause

670
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:55,760
It just stays so now what we want to do is we want to look at go back to your campaigns

671
00:46:56,320 --> 00:47:01,120
Sorry, I didn't mean to freak you out. Okay. So yeah now just click the one that's open click that just click it

672
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:05,120
Now that'll take you to the next one. Now you can look at now look at the top

673
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:11,360
Keeps bringing that that damn window for you. Um, now you can see okay. So now notice how now you have that campaign

674
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:16,800
Yeah, okay. So now you can even you can select an ad group if you had multiple ad groups

675
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:19,760
Which which is fine. Now you can look at keywords

676
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,160
Uh, no problem. Todd. We'll see you later

677
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:27,760
Right here. You can look. Uh, yes, and now that should be under this ad group. See how

678
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:31,680
Yeah, see you at the top. Yeah. Okay. Now you shouldn't see that

679
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:33,520
that

680
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:37,120
Okay, is that helpful sometimes when you see stuff? That's weird

681
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:42,480
What I like to do is I look at the top where it says search keywords and it has that like that's that's

682
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:48,640
Like right there. See how you go above that. See how it says you all campaigns what campaign and what ad group?

683
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:53,840
Yeah, so if I if i'm ever looking at my I call it the spreadsheet section and i'm like

684
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:58,160
This doesn't make sense to me. I typically go up and go. Oh, I forgot to select that

685
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:02,560
Um, and the other place you can get in trouble is on like the top of the spreadsheet

686
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:06,960
Where the plus sign is and I call it the little martini glass you have the filters

687
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:11,600
Sometimes people don't realize they added a filter to it if you go down go down

688
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:16,320
Go down go down right right right there. See I have the little martini

689
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:21,200
So sometimes people do a filter and they forget and they're like I can't find this and this isn't looking and I go

690
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:26,240
Well, your filters are turned on so you have to turn those off and then the other common one is the date range

691
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:31,280
So just fyi, so if you ever find yourself or you're like what i'm looking at doesn't make sense

692
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,360
um, that's just a just an fyi for you just uh

693
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:40,880
Just check those things and typically that you'll be able to sort out what you're not seeing

694
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:44,560
Yeah, it typically like for some reason it always goes back to the last date

695
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:47,680
I looked at and then i'm like wait, why am I not? Oh, it's not current. So

696
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:54,240
Yeah, that's fine. You're good. Okay, so we got our keywords here. Okay, so here's something that's interesting

697
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,240
So you have a lot of impressions?

698
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:00,880
And a lot of clicks at really really really cheap cpc

699
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:05,600
My gut is that you have display network on and search partners on

700
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,280
I turned it off. But can we look maybe where I go for that?

701
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,760
Uh should be in your settings

702
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:14,080
For your campaign campaign settings

703
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,680
Sorry, tell me where to go just go to campaigns

704
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:23,040
You're gonna go to the settings just hover over it

705
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:27,440
Hover over the yep. See the little yep. Okay

706
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:36,080
I'm having a hard time finding places. I get lost. Okay. Yeah right there networks google search network search partners display an hour

707
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:41,440
Shoot, I thought it's okay. It's super easy to super easy to miss. So go ahead save

708
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:43,600
I did it on that other campaign

709
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:49,440
That was the other castor valley and then I couldn't find it when I went to create it the draft. So that's why I did this other one

710
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:50,800
Yeah

711
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,800
Okay, so that's gonna help

712
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:55,680
That's that could be your number one issue right now

713
00:49:56,160 --> 00:50:00,240
Okay. Yeah, we had a really it was saying the cpc was really low

714
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:06,480
Yeah, that's that's because you're yeah, and that's because you're running display ads and search partner ads

715
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,200
Uh, okay

716
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:15,280
And then audiences we just did castor valley now that you know, it's 63,000 and our budget is 56 a day

717
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:21,840
We try doing your calculation the 75 percent time, you know all that. Yeah for the main keywords. Um

718
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:26,800
But we're just not getting a lot of data in castor valley or even big cities near us

719
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,880
Like a lot of stuff is there's no cpc

720
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,640
Uh for our keywords, so we did the best we could

721
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:34,640
So

722
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:38,640
Okay, yeah, no, I think you're so I think that's your biggest issue was that

723
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:42,720
Okay, it's just that it's not firing where you want it to fire

724
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:46,800
All right. So now that'll be changed so that that should help you out

725
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:51,920
A lot and todd is off. But I mean these are all I have for keywords

726
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:56,320
Yeah, if that's what you saw in the data then that's what you use

727
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:58,000
Okay

728
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:04,480
But I think right now it's just like you got 230 impressions like I doubt that many I doubt that's your monthly search volume at all

729
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:07,360
Yeah, it's like 10

730
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,440
on each word

731
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:14,080
so you're not going to get a lot of you're not going to get a lot of action in that city, but

732
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:20,720
You'll get action which is good and it's california. So you don't want to get into competitive areas

733
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:23,680
So just hang tight where you're at and now that you made that

734
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:28,960
I think that was the biggest factor was you're just accidentally left the display network and search partners on

735
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:33,120
Okay, and then that's why your clicks are probably crappy and you're like, I don't get it

736
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:39,280
I'm getting clicks, but no one's calling or they're they're just clicking display ads and stuff and those are typically robots at night

737
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,920
Okay, and then um

738
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:47,760
Do you think we were going to try and put a logo on the ad but it makes me do advertiser verification

739
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:49,840
How hard is that?

740
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:54,560
The advertiser verification process well if it forces you there's a well

741
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:57,440
Them trying to get a logo out of you is different than

742
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:01,520
Them forcing you to do advertiser verification. So I just dismiss it

743
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:05,440
If you but if you make up a logo for him, you can put a logo in there

744
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,280
I mean we have one

745
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:12,720
But I I didn't want to have to do the whole advertiser verification because it was asking me stuff and I was like

746
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:15,840
It says are you running this for your your reason?

747
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:21,760
Yeah, that's you that's getting you verified which is fine you're gonna have you'll have to go through that at some point

748
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,400
But let it tell you you have to do it by this date

749
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:27,440
Okay, like I have on the other on the other one

750
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:31,920
When you do that, do you say you're working as an agency or you are the business?

751
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:36,640
Um, i'm the agency so I always use it as like i'm an agency

752
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:42,400
Okay, yeah rather than the business because then it's like now you have to get paperwork from the business

753
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:48,800
Do all that stuff and that could get weird it's easier to say yeah, I run my I run a small digital marketing agency

754
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:53,600
Yeah, okay. Got it. And then last question for you is

755
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:59,280
Should we be so he has the business owner has his own website

756
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:06,880
His website is you know been around a while. It's not getting any it's not doing great in the rank and rent industry

757
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:12,400
But we're wondering if it would be better to run some run the ad to his website

758
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:16,560
It's been around a lot longer and create a landing page off of this

759
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:22,240
As opposed to running him to castro valley our our rank and rent site

760
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:25,760
Or our landing page that's on our rank and rent site, but hidden

761
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:28,640
That makes sense

762
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:30,880
um

763
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:33,120
I mean

764
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:35,360
Because we don't have a gmb yet on castor valley

765
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:39,040
Where is our landing page? Yeah, but that's that's gonna just be

766
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:43,680
That that's an seo thing. That's not really

767
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:49,760
An ad worry. Yeah, not really an ad worry about it. But yeah, I I wouldn't um

768
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:57,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can do either one but I mean I would keep my own assets

769
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:05,120
Okay, so run it to ours if we're running the ad to a landing page. Well, never mind. Just hang on. Um

770
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:11,200
We have a we have two tracking numbers. We have the you know, the organic going to our website and then we have the landing page

771
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:15,920
Um for the ad that has a different phone number. So we're tracking like what's coming from what?

772
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:20,080
And then yeah, okay

773
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:26,240
Because we'd have to build a landing page off of his page with a different phone number because this is actually going to him

774
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,880
Yes, he won't be okay

775
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:34,240
Um, hey matt if you're listening any other questions i'm just asking my husband. Is that it pretty good?

776
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Okay, maybe he's not on uh

777
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:45,040
Okay, cool. So just try that for a while and maybe expand to a few more cities if we're not getting a lot

778
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:47,520
Yeah, be careful with that area

779
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:54,080
Yeah expensive just make sure before you even expand it. I would run every little city every zip code has its own

780
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:57,040
Due diligence just so you know what you're getting into

781
00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:01,040
56 a day is really not a lot in california for

782
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:02,960
ads, you know

783
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:06,000
So, you know just just take that for whatever it's worth it

784
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:10,320
At the end of the day, there's not a lot of search volume in the city that you're finding which is fine

785
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:11,840
um

786
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:17,920
But the the other factor is that your ads weren't running to google search ads. They were running to other places

787
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:23,840
So it's kind of giving you a false sense of what's going on. So great. Okay. Yeah

788
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:30,800
Yeah, and oh now we're getting to the page bit. You're in united. No, you're in the united states. Okay. There we go

789
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:33,920
Yeah, so because I was just there was blank data

790
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,560
So when we tried to figure out what's an appropriate budget we just we could only do it for a couple few words

791
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:45,920
So we just assumed it was going to be that much for the other that's saying it's 140 000 people that that ads running to

792
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,520
Which is fine

793
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:48,960
Yeah to reach

794
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:51,840
Yeah, see we have nothing to go for for those common

795
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:57,520
Are you seeing ads like when you look there are you seeing people run ads in cash?

796
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:00,320
Yeah, okay

797
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:03,760
Yeah, there's tree trimming right there I saw

798
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:09,620
So yeah, I found like a couple so I went with this as the high of what 1469

799
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:15,040
And I think I just kind of did however many keywords six and I just was like, all right

800
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:17,840
Let's consider they're all around that amount and make sure

801
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:25,680
Was close. No, that's fine. And your search volume's so low that I wouldn't be worried about it. You can see fluctuations in the search volume

802
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:28,000
um

803
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,640
So yeah, i'm not that familiar with that city

804
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,120
So it could just be that maybe there's just not a lot of trees there

805
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:35,440
But I kind of think that area has a lot of trees, right?

806
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:40,960
There's a lot and the crazy thing is when I do it impressions is above three thousands

807
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:43,660
3000 but it's saying 10

808
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:48,080
That's search volume but your impressions we're going to

809
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:52,960
Display ads and search networks. That's that's a whole other beast. You just

810
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:59,360
They will span the shit out of the web the internet on with your stuff like you had stuff running ads on

811
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,200
Um, like on people's games

812
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:08,240
You know, they could run like a free game and it shows you an ad you had you your ads were showing there

813
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,200
to like take a kid playing like

814
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:16,560
Block blast or some I don't know gold digger game out whatever the hell the kids are playing

815
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:21,840
But like that's what your ads are running to in that area when you have display network and other stuff on

816
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:28,080
So that would affect what we saw in the forecast because we were under that campaign when we were searching in keyword planner

817
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:33,040
Oh, that's why in the budget was showing such a low cpc

818
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:42,100
And a high impression, oh, okay interesting we're like, why are these impressions so high it should only be like 1500

819
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:47,840
Let's see. It's you know, it's united states. Okay. All right united states again. Yep

820
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:54,480
Seven point two thousand that makes no sense

821
00:57:55,200 --> 00:58:00,560
Because newark, which is a bigger city used to be like around fifteen to two thousand

822
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:05,120
So, I don't know that's funky

823
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:11,120
Uh forecasting Brian. Oh, okay. No, that's fine. Uh, no you bring that back what you're doing

824
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:16,320
I know go back to where you were. I'll I'll show you something that's let's try to look at something differently there

825
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:22,480
All right, so see where it says match type for a keyword it says all keywords maximize clicks and then

826
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:25,600
Match type. Okay. Now change that

827
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:28,320
now do phrase

828
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,320
Now hit apply

829
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:32,320
Let's see if that changes

830
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:35,280
Okay, so let's see if that changes

831
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:38,320
Okay, so let's see if that changes

832
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:41,200
Okay, now change that now do phrase

833
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:45,360
Now hit apply let's see if that changes

834
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:50,720
Went down a bit and look at what the what's the average daily budget

835
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:58,480
56 66 and what does that say it is 57. Yes, that's 57, which is what you have. So you're you're right there

836
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:02,720
Okay, it's just a lot of impressions

837
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:05,840
More than I expect to see for those this city

838
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:07,920
Yes

839
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:11,200
Yeah, but this is where like, you know in the past people, you know

840
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:16,640
Well, you know simrush shows this mangle shows that keyword planner shows this, you know

841
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:20,400
rare is really good because rare brings up rare will bring up your

842
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:26,560
Like google keyword data, right or google keyword planner data. So it's been really good to use

843
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:33,280
Yeah, but like that's why I tell people like you can even see mistakes inside google planner where like

844
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:38,320
One thing says something totally different than the other thing. So like none of this is perfect

845
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:42,560
Right. We just whatever data we have we just try to make the best decisions on it

846
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:46,720
But even here you can see that there's just weird differences with them

847
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:52,240
Yeah, just a lot higher than we used to see for even newark, but maybe the season two and the time frame

848
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:54,240
It's looking out for the forecast

849
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:57,040
Yeah, it knows it's going to get busier right now

850
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:59,360
Yeah spring

851
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:03,840
Yep. Yeah. Yep. Okay. All right cool. And then I see a more accurate cpc

852
01:00:05,020 --> 01:00:10,560
17 15 13 dollars. It was low. It was like a dollar and we're like, yes, this is amazing

853
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:14,320
Yeah, no, that was just brought and that's because of the broad match thing

854
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:19,760
Oh, okay. Never like watch if you like now do exact match watch it drop even more

855
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:21,760
Yeah

856
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:25,280
See that

857
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:27,280
Okay, okay. All right

858
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:32,000
Okay, i've never even seen this is this the new feature or this has always been there. It's always been there

859
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:37,200
Oh my gosh, we just don't really teach doing the forecast thing. I think you guys get that from shiv's group. Yep

860
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:39,360
We do. Yeah. Yeah

861
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:42,320
Yep. Okay. Cool. Thank you so much. That was very

862
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:44,480
as usual

863
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:48,000
Awesome. That was helpful. Okay. All right. Take care

864
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:53,680
Um josh, I see you have a couple questions, but let me get to chris because he's been waiting patiently chris. What's up, man?

865
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:55,920
Thank you for being patient waiting

866
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:04,820
Is he there chris if you're there you're muted

867
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:14,080
Yes, no, no, yes, okay

868
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:16,960
all right, um

869
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:21,200
All right. Oh josh you had some questions. Let me see

870
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:26,880
Uh digital ad doi how to for yes, you did that manually

871
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:31,520
Okay, is that something you guys recommend? I haven't made it through all the ad things yet

872
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:37,520
It's not something that we like teach that you have to do but like it's something i've i've gone over with people like

873
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:40,400
these are some changes you should make and do but it's

874
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:43,600
it's uh

875
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:45,360
Um

876
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:50,080
There's some negative keywords that you'll just understand you just add like free cheap

877
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:52,320
do it yourself

878
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:55,120
you know this but there's like there's some areas that like

879
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:57,760
like

880
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:58,880
um

881
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:03,520
Let me say like like how much would uh, like how much would it cost to have my tree? Yeah

882
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,120
okay, so like I would say that um

883
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,080
like for me

884
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:15,040
Like in one area that might work for me where maybe I do like like with janelle like she doesn't have a lot of

885
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:16,960
Search volume

886
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:21,760
So maybe allowing that question is not a bad thing because it maybe gets my site one more rep

887
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:25,600
But if I was running that ad in a larger city

888
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:31,600
I maybe don't want to have I don't want to spend nine dollars for someone to ask the question about how much something costs

889
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:34,720
so I don't really teach it as you have to do it because

890
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:40,960
People are running ads in towns of 30 000 people and like you're doing it for 4 million people, right?

891
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:45,440
So like it so it's gonna be different like it'll be different. So I try to not

892
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:49,200
Like this is how it has to be done. It's more of like guidelines

893
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:51,520
You could do this if it makes sense for you

894
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:57,920
But there's small small population areas where like I don't mind if people call because there's not a lot of not a lot of search volume

895
01:02:58,080 --> 01:02:59,280
There's not a lot of competition

896
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:01,520
So if my business owner is getting people on the phone

897
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:08,160
Calling and asking them questions or sending in a form asking questions. That's one more person that they get to try to sell to

898
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:13,440
If I get enough if I get enough of them and i'm like they're just kicking the tires and not converting

899
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:15,760
I'll get rid of it. But yeah, so

900
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:20,560
Because I see a lot of it not a straight answer but like that's why yeah that checks out

901
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:26,160
It's a lot of in my search terms section. It's a lot of like how much do windows cost?

902
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:32,480
How much to replace the window how much this or price this so I can see if it was a strategic way to

903
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:35,680
how get more views that's a that's okay, but

904
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:39,040
It's a lot of variations of those

905
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:43,040
Yeah, and where you're running your ads out like this would be like

906
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:45,920
like

907
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:50,080
Because you're running it to like a super major metro area millions of people

908
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:56,880
Um, I would maybe talk to my business owner and go hey man, i'm seeing like this is a lower cost item

909
01:03:57,360 --> 01:03:58,720
Let's build you a landing page

910
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:05,600
Let's build a sales funnel where we start collecting people's info and bring them through like a lead form type of thing

911
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:09,840
To get a higher quality lead that's asking questions about how much something costs

912
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:13,360
Got it. That's the thought right now all of a sudden

913
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:19,200
Maybe that's a value now becomes maybe in a large area. It's an easy thing to break through the noise

914
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:23,360
Someone's like well how much would it cost? Oh, you know, thanks for clicking our ad

915
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:27,280
Like let's get some let's give you a good quote. How big's your house?

916
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:34,320
How many windows you have how many are you interested in this or this and all of a sudden you're just bringing them through

917
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:39,440
And if that person's serious, they're going to click through you may give them a freaking quote right there

918
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,520
over the computer

919
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:42,640
And they're like, okay

920
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:48,320
then now they have a range and now you're like maybe before you give them that hey give us your phone number or an email and

921
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:50,400
We'll send you a quote right now

922
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:56,000
Boom, and you set up a bot that sends an email and a text and it sends your business owner or something

923
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,680
But that's like super advanced

924
01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:02,080
That's why we don't teach metro area stay away from that until you like understand that stuff

925
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:06,800
Some people will get that and be able to do that. But like again, that's like I said earlier

926
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:08,480
What would I tell your friend?

927
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:14,240
How much I would run it's going to be thousands of dollars a month. I'm gonna want from that guy, but that's why

928
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:17,040
Those are the things that we'll do to help them convert. Yeah

929
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:20,880
That's very helpful. Yeah, no problem

930
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:24,160
And cool. All right, chris. Are you there?

931
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:30,000
Give me a chance to get back on let me see here she google sheet by the way

932
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:32,960
Oh, yeah, that was pretty cool. Huh laura

933
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:36,000
Uh, jason, I think we answered your question on keywords, I hope

934
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:39,200
um

935
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:41,200
Cool. All right

936
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:46,960
Let me see no chris. All right, josh, you have any other questions at all? I do just one more

937
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:51,840
Phrase match so I saw in the training that you teach to use the phrase match as

938
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:55,840
Or keywords. Do you get into exact match as well?

939
01:05:56,960 --> 01:06:00,640
Oh, yeah. Yeah, there's nothing wrong with using exact match. It's just that

940
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:03,360
when you're

941
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:09,440
When you're running to the smaller cities and towns we're not typically running against like a bunch of ad experts

942
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:10,640
so

943
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:14,960
You don't really need to have the variation. I will I do tell people like if you're going to do like

944
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:17,360
Tree trimming near me

945
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:19,440
I would make that an exact match because

946
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:23,920
Even though the phrase match tree trimming will cut will

947
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:28,000
May land land an ad for that. There's a competitive

948
01:06:29,020 --> 01:06:30,320
advantage

949
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:32,480
Maybe a speed advantage to having

950
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:36,080
A certain search term as an exact match

951
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:43,040
Might fire like a millisecond less than a blink of an eye faster than something that's on a phrase match

952
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:46,320
But again, we're talking about being in super competitive areas

953
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:51,360
And then also a lot of students like I we have people that are very very new

954
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:55,680
And they're like, I don't know anything about they're like still learning about keywords

955
01:06:56,400 --> 01:07:03,600
And it's a little different like that's why if you guys have seen francesca coming on on on fridays to like talk about like

956
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:06,080
Because there's a difference between

957
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:07,360
so

958
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:10,000
You know taking a step back the long-term play is seo

959
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:16,240
The short-term thing is you're going to use ads put your foot in the door and start making money and get business owners now

960
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:23,120
Which is way better and faster than building ranking waiting and then go crap. I made a mistake

961
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:27,840
There's six months down. I just wasted six months on this website, right?

962
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:33,360
Or there's nobody in this area that wants to do it or their search volume's really bad or whatever it might be

963
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:39,600
With the ads you're getting that yes or no so fast that it's worth the extra couple hundred dollars

964
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,040
Than it is to be like you either learn a mistake really fast

965
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:46,160
You learn that this area sucks really fast

966
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:51,200
uh, and it could just be like I mean there's a lot of places that i've gone to that i'm like

967
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:53,440
on paper it checks out

968
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:59,280
and i've done this in the past where I I learned first to like build and rank and then rent it out and

969
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:01,360
I would get like

970
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:06,880
All the numbers are here my ads this I are like my my website's here all this stuff

971
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:11,120
I cannot get a business owner at all and take my leads because they're so fat and happy

972
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:18,240
And so like nobody's like why why would I why would I uh pay you i'm i'm booked out 18 months in advance

973
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:21,920
And then you find out that like shit. There's just not a lot of contractors in this area

974
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:26,160
Or there's they have so much work that they're not worried about even they're

975
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:32,160
Works waiting on them, right people are waiting on them. And so then you go. Oh shit. Okay, so

976
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:35,360
You know making that mistake on an seo thing

977
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:41,200
Is very frustrating because I have several sites that rank really well and still give occasional lead here and there

978
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:44,880
Like

979
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:47,600
I couldn't give it away. I can't give it away to people

980
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:52,960
I've I have one where I had a guy that was driving four hours for certain jobs because they were that valuable

981
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:54,460
I mean we're talking like

982
01:08:54,460 --> 01:08:57,360
300 000 jobs the guy's like yeah, i'll do that. I'm like, okay

983
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:00,480
But it's like he's not going to take every lead, you know

984
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:04,320
So it's just things like that. We're like i'm like, this is ridiculous. So

985
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:10,080
By by doing nick's method, I would have done that first there. I would have test built a one pager

986
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:15,840
Tested it out gotten some leads. I would have found that answer very fast and been like, okay

987
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:18,960
Maybe this isn't hey, I don't want to spend my time and money here

988
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:23,520
You know, you know, maybe i'll put it on the back burner come back to it in six months. Does that make sense?

989
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:26,000
So it does yeah, it's very helpful

990
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:30,160
Yeah, so that's why i'm just doing that to try to help you guys

991
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:35,840
Understand the due diligence part, but then because when the when the program was first created

992
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:38,960
We were using smart campaigns which were actually smart

993
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:44,400
Which actually understood your broad match keywords and your website and understood that like

994
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:47,840
Who you were and what you were trying to do and it pointed you in that direction

995
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:52,960
So it was really easy and fast, but that's gone. So now we're stuck in expert world

996
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:58,960
Where there's no medium world in the google ad space. So like we're trying to teach you like beginner

997
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:05,600
Expert so like we're actually trying to teach you the medium level because that's who your competition is where the cities that we recommend

998
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:10,240
That's really helpful and I appreciate you guys taking that approach. It's it's gonna pay off

999
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:14,080
It does it does there's a lot of success stories here. I mean, there's people

1000
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:19,680
I mean, they're right. I mean they're passing they've passed me up and what I make so it's pretty awesome to see that

1001
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:22,160
You see people doing that. So

1002
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:24,160
Yeah

1003
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:28,240
Awesome. Well, I really appreciate you jumping on and helping me out with some of these i'm gonna have more questions for you

1004
01:10:28,240 --> 01:10:33,520
So i'll be sliding in your dms and then wait for the next live chat room. Um, just want to say thank you so much

1005
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:38,400
Yeah, no problem. Like I said, we'll be here. I try to do it once once a week as my schedule permits

1006
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:40,400
So otherwise, that's it

1007
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:45,940
Cool. All right. Um, I think that's it. Let me see Janelle. Do you have any other questions?

1008
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:55,220
I think she's gone. Okay, cool. All right, man. We'll see you guys later. Have a good one

1009
01:10:58,240 --> 01:11:00,480
You
