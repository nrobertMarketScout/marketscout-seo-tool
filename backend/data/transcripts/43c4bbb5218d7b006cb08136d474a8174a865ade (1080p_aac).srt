1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,760
I say exclusivity agreement as well,

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:02,600
and I explain what it means.

3
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,560
If they say they don't do contracts, I call BS.

4
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,060
We have credit cards.

5
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,360
We hand credit cards to teenagers

6
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,960
in drive throws all the time.

7
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,640
The exclusivity agreement is for the protection of the BO.

8
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,440
Yeah. Good point, Mahmood.

9
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,280
It is true.

10
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,280
You don't need to call it a contract.

11
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,680
Call it an exclusivity agreement.

12
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,520
If they say, hey, can I cancel?

13
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,760
Then you can say, no.

14
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,320
You can say however you want, but no, obviously not.

15
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,120
But if you want to find somebody to replace you

16
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,440
for the rest of those months, you can.

17
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,400
But no, we don't do that.

18
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,660
You know, that kind of a thing.

19
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,060
But guys, just be confident.

20
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,820
When you say something, be confident,

21
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,320
and they'll be confident if you're timid.

22
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,220
Well, yeah, there is, but then it's not gonna work.

23
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:37,060
Okay?

24
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:37,900
Call it an exclusivity agreement.

25
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:38,740
Call it a contract.

26
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:39,660
Nobody cares.

27
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,100
Just be confident with what you say.

28
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,540
Got it? Francesca, you got it?

29
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:45,360
I got it.
