1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,480
So, what do you do when the customer objects?

2
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,200
You go through the whole thing, you do the Amex or Visa, you do the Assumption close

3
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,840
and the customer says they want to think about it, the customer has to talk to their business

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,960
partner, the customer this, the customer that, they got to check their budget, whatever.

5
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,740
We should know what the objections are gonna be and you're probably going, oh crap, I forgot

6
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:34,340
to hit on that one or I didn't hit on it hard enough and you're gonna know exactly what

7
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:35,740
you did wrong in that moment.

8
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:36,740
What do you do?

9
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:40,780
Okay, well first of all, what you don't do is you don't give up because 99% of sales

10
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:44,540
people are taught that this is where the deal starts, right?

11
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:47,660
You got the grant card notes out there, this is where the deal starts, this is the objections,

12
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:48,660
right?

13
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,300
And it's like, kind of true, but I'm a big believer in just overcoming the objection.

14
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,820
However, you are gonna have times where you forget, you are gonna have times where you

15
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:59,460
don't do it correctly, you are gonna have times where you've done it so many times you get

16
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:03,660
lazy and you forget to do, to overcome the objection beforehand.

17
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,580
You forgot to check if they watched the screencast.

18
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,300
You are going to have to deal with objections.

19
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:11,060
The cool part is because we've focused so much on the setup, the objections are gonna

20
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:12,060
be minimal.

21
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,140
We're not gonna have to dig through a treasure trove of objections to close this thing, okay?

22
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,780
So I'm gonna do a very basic training on how to handle objections, which we will do more

23
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:24,640
in-depth training later, but I want you guys to notice something.

24
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,600
Most sales trainings, they would spend majority of their time talking about this part, which

25
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:33,160
is the objection handling, but I've spent most of my time talking about the setup and

26
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:36,840
the close because you can just overcome it all there, okay?

27
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,480
However, I do know this happens.

28
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:42,300
It even happens with me from time to time and it's usually, well, it's not usually,

29
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,300
it is your fault.

30
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,300
You missed a step, okay?

31
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,360
But what do you do?

32
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,920
So I'm gonna go over a quick little training and the first thing that you wanna do is you

33
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,680
have to tie them down, okay?

34
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,920
And I have an entire video that we did, a live stream, and we'll try and link it up

35
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:59,420
or make it accessible, but we did this entire training on this concept, okay?

36
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:03,440
First thing that you need to do is you need to tie them down to that objection, okay?

37
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:08,500
Think of it as you're trying to get them into a corner so you can kill them, right?

38
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,520
Which I know is a little aggressive or a better example maybe of not using something so extreme

39
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:17,880
is all of the, you're in a house and you want to keep all the air in the house, right?

40
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,120
And every window that's open is an objection.

41
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,200
And in order for you to close the sale, you need to get all the windows closed, right?

42
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,880
And every window is an objection, so you're just going through closed, closed, closed,

43
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,960
closed, but you need to find out which windows are closed and which windows are open.

44
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,580
So first thing you need to do is you need to tie them down.

45
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:38,120
So here's what I would do is if they say I need to talk to, or let's use a different

46
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,120
example.

47
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,960
That one rarely should come up because you should make sure that the business owner's

48
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,240
partners are on the phone or that they're the decision maker.

49
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,240
That shouldn't come up.

50
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:52,760
But let's say that they object and say they wanna think about it, which is pretty common,

51
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,640
let me mull this over, let me get back to you.

52
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,920
That's a really common objection.

53
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,400
So here's what you're gonna do is you're gonna say, yeah, and you're gonna say, you're gonna

54
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,400
agree first.

55
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,680
You're gonna go, yeah, I feel you, man, I totally get it.

56
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,680
And you're gonna tie them down.

57
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,480
You're gonna go, so let me just ask you this and then, this will be really quick, let me

58
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,080
just ask you this and then we'll hop off, because I don't want them to feel like we're

59
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,000
getting into battle mode, right?

60
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,880
So I'll say, besides just thinking about it, is there any other questions, does anything

61
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,840
else, besides just like the fact of thinking about it, anything else that doesn't make

62
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:32,200
sense, like assuming you think about it and it makes sense, like is there any other reason

63
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,200
that you wouldn't wanna move forward with this today, okay?

64
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,600
And you have to tie them down.

65
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,200
Because if you don't, then there could be multiple objections.

66
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,780
This could be what they call a smoke screen.

67
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,480
It's not the real objection, right?

68
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,520
So what you're gonna find is when you say that, sometimes they'll go, well, I mean,

69
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,440
I need to think about it, but also I need to check with my partner.

70
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,120
And you go, oh, I forgot that one too.

71
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,120
So now you got two.

72
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,160
So okay, all right, so besides thinking about it and besides talking to your partner, is

73
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,920
there any other reason or any other question of why this wouldn't make sense today, why

74
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,480
you wouldn't wanna move forward today?

75
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,360
Nope, that's it, okay?

76
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,000
And now you can start digging in.

77
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,320
But what we've done is we've taken all that list of objections and we've eliminated all

78
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,440
the other ones and we've narrowed it down to one or two, okay?

79
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,560
So in this example, I'm gonna just share if you've got one objection, because if you guys

80
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,840
are doing this correctly, you should have no objections and if you miss a step, you

81
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,640
should have only one.

82
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:27,240
But I'm gonna just assume this person just wants to think about it, okay?

83
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,560
And so then what you're gonna wanna do is dig in a little bit and be like, so if you

84
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,400
don't mind me asking, what exactly do you wanna think about?

85
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,480
Because to me, everything sounds like it makes sense.

86
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,840
And listen, okay?

87
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,880
Don't let it sound salesy, don't put pressure, but listen to what they say.

88
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,160
What exactly do you wanna think about, okay?

89
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,120
And they're gonna tell you, they're gonna say.

90
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:53,620
And then you're gonna listen and look at cues and try to pick up on what they're actually

91
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:56,120
saying, not just the words that are coming out of their mouth, okay?

92
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,520
So you're gonna tie it down.

93
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,180
You're gonna ask a follow-up question or two about that objection.

94
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,180
Maybe it's a spouse.

95
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:07,640
Okay, what exactly do you need to talk to your partner about, right?

96
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,760
Do you need his blessing, her blessing?

97
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,760
Is he the actual decision-maker?

98
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,240
Am I talking to the wrong person?

99
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,160
You can do a little pride game there.

100
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,460
Dig into it, okay?

101
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:22,020
And then you're gonna use the magic feel felt found, okay?

102
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,020
It's a three-step process.

103
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,720
So as I said before, we want to agree.

104
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:35,180
So they're gonna say, yeah, I just wanna make sure that this is the right decision, right?

105
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:40,140
Because it's like 2,000 bucks, I just wanna make sure it's a good decision, right?

106
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,540
Yeah, I feel you, man.

107
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,900
I feel you, ma'am, ma'am, man.

108
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:44,900
I feel it.

109
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:45,900
You're gonna agree first.

110
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,340
I totally understand.

111
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,340
I feel you, okay?

112
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,340
That's it.

113
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,340
Just say, I feel you.

114
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,540
Just let them know you understand.

115
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:56,100
Then what you're gonna do is you're gonna use an example, and this is why it's really

116
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,740
important to have a bunch of examples in your back pocket, which we'll get into later.

117
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:02,380
You're gonna use an example of one of your clients, okay?

118
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:05,380
And this could be one of my clients, one of somebody else's clients, or one of your own

119
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:09,820
clients, and that's why you need to have a pocketbook full of these, a Rolodex full of

120
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,820
these.

121
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:14,760
You're gonna say, funny that you say that, do you remember that guy Brooks that I was

122
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,840
showing you earlier, the Bentonville Concord guy?

123
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,440
Yeah, I remember him.

124
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:23,000
Okay, he, when we talked, and again, this has been a couple years ago, he felt the exact

125
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
same way.

126
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
We talked, and everything looked right, and he's just like, dude, I just want to think

127
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
about it.

128
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,360
So, just so you know, I'm with you, okay?

129
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,560
So Phil felt, right?

130
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,280
Brooks, it's way different than if you say, yeah, man, I get you.

131
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,320
I felt the same way, blank, right?

132
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:43,280
You, of course you felt the same way, and you're gonna try and convince them, but when

133
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,640
it's Brooks, when it's the client, it's totally different, it's a third party, right?

134
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,880
So yeah, you remember Brooks, yeah, he felt the exact same way.

135
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:57,280
That comes to step three, which is what he found, so you're gonna go, yeah, but after

136
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:02,800
we talked about it, and I asked him, Brooks, what do you want to think about, what he found,

137
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,440
or what he realized, doesn't need to be those exact words, but what he realized is that

138
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:12,440
he was already paying for Google Ads, he wanted exclusive leads, he was tired of the leads

139
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:17,680
being pimped out, and that there was really no risk, because even if I only, if I just

140
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,600
sent him 10 leads, or 12 leads, he was gonna at the very least double his money.

141
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:27,320
And so, what he ended up doing, he's like, dude, really it's just me being, like, putting

142
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,680
off the inevitable, so let's do it.

143
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,000
So Brian, you know this makes sense, you've seen the case studies, you already told me

144
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,600
that I'm not full of crap, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, let's do the deal, man.

145
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,720
Are you an Amex or Visa?

146
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,400
Let's quit messing around, okay?

147
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,480
And you're gonna go back for the close, okay?

148
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:50,920
I know that might sound scary, but you know what's more scary is being broke.

149
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:54,920
You know what's more scary is getting off the call and missing out on a $2,000 per month

150
00:07:54,920 --> 00:08:02,280
deal, a $24,000 per year deal that you could have gotten by just saying one line that was

151
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,200
a little bit uncomfortable for you in that moment.

152
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:09,600
And I understand, I'm not that aggressive, but I get it, I get it, but guess what, get

153
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:14,200
used to being uncomfortable once in a while, because you're gonna have to get uncomfortable

154
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,200
to be comfortable.

155
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:21,800
You know what's comfortable is using that $2,000 to sip my ties on the beach in Mexico

156
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:26,440
and have people rub cocoa butter on your belly while you're reading a book, okay?

157
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,440
That's comfortable.

158
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,360
But you're gonna have to use a little bit of, you're gonna have to go through a little

159
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,080
bit of discomfort sometimes to get to the comfortable.

160
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,600
So what I do in these moments when I'm like, oh, this is gonna be awkward, I start thinking

161
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,360
about, hey, this might be a little awkward, I'm not comfortable.

162
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,560
I wouldn't choose to do this on my spare time, but you know what, this is that hour

163
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:47,320
I psyched myself up before, this is where I need to meet business, and I need to get

164
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:51,360
to business, and it might be a little uncomfortable, and it might be a little, but guess what,

165
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,040
I want the money more than I care about the discomfort, than I wanted to avoid the discomfort,

166
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,040
and I'll say it.

167
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,960
I'll go, look, Brian, let's just talk real here.

168
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,820
You know you need to do this, and there's not another option out there like this.

169
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,200
Everything checks the boxes.

170
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,880
What card are we putting on file, man, let's not mess around, okay, come on, come on, man.

171
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,080
You already know the answer.

172
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,240
You know that the second we get off this call, you already know the answer, okay.

173
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,760
You can put this off as long as you want, and you also know that, and guys, this is

174
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:21,440
the beautiful part, is we've already told them if we've done this correctly, well, some

175
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,440
of you guys might not have, and that might be why they wanna think about it, right, but

176
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:29,320
if we've done this correctly, we can remind them, hey, I already told you, I have a call

177
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:35,440
in an hour, right, I would like to do the deal with you, so, and again, make sure to

178
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,440
have the no fear of loss.

179
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,600
Look, at the same time, I wanna do this, I wanna work with you, if it doesn't make sense,

180
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:46,280
I'll work with them, but I know this makes sense, so, what's the card, man?

181
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:50,280
Let's do this, okay, what's the card, man?

182
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:57,720
Be bold, so, just to recap, really, really quick, okay, tie them down, make sure that's

183
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:02,600
the objection and the only, okay, ask a few follow-up questions to understand the objection,

184
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:07,480
then you're gonna use the Phil felt found method, and you're gonna go back for the close,

185
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,040
that's it.
