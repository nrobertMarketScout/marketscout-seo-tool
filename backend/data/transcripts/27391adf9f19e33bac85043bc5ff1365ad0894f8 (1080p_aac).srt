1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,780
All right, let's go ahead and do the market analysis, the market research on the cities

2
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,020
that you chose.

3
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:22,840
And guys, again, I would recommend having a couple cities that you can look at because

4
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:28,240
you may do your research on the first one, it doesn't fit the bill, and be okay, mentally

5
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:34,640
be prepared to do 10, 15, 20 of these before you go ahead and build.

6
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,520
That might not be the case because we've done a lot of legwork to start off, but if it ends

7
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,320
up being the case, just be okay with it.

8
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,880
Realize that that is time well spent and that it's going to be worth it in the long run

9
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,920
because you're going to be able to avoid a bunch of SEO, okay?

10
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,920
Let's go over to the screen.

11
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,360
All right, so we're over here, I'm going to have you grab, there's going to be a download

12
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,360
with the market research worksheet.

13
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,920
It's also in the Facebook group, it should be here in the training as well.

14
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:05,880
Just download that, and then what I want you to do is I want you to go and make a copy.

15
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,560
So, you know, hit make a copy, name it however you want, I like to put the service city,

16
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,800
I'll remove the template and go from there.

17
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,600
I've already done this, I'm going to show you.

18
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:19,440
I named it Concrete, Queen Creek, Arizona, due diligence, however you're going to remember

19
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,960
it doesn't matter, okay?

20
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,820
I fill out a few basic things, Concrete's the niche, it's 52,000 people, it should be

21
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:26,820
phone driven.

22
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:31,820
I keep this here to remind you, if it's a walk in business, if it's a dentist, probably

23
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,220
not the niche you should be in, okay?

24
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:37,180
But just trust me on the niches I'm recommending, so yes, it's a phone driven business.

25
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:42,260
Next, what we're going to do is we're going to take our keyword list from the niche we

26
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:47,020
decided on, which as I told you guys, if you can't decide, just choose Concrete.

27
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:51,300
We're going to take those keywords and we're going to use these keywords to see what the

28
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:55,420
competition looks like, because we want to rank for these keywords long term, so we want

29
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,220
to see what kind of competition we're up against.

30
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:01,780
Now, there's a word of caution, do not just do one keyword, do not type in Concrete,

31
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:06,020
Contractor, Queen Creek, Arizona, do the homework on that one keyword and then make a decision

32
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,300
based on that, because that's inaccurate.

33
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:12,820
What I mean by that is you could potentially see a city where Concrete, Contractor, Queen

34
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:17,340
Creek, Arizona is very, very competitive, and the other four, five, six terms that you

35
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,260
search for, no competition, okay?

36
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:24,460
You could also see the reverse, you look at one term, oh yeah, this is going to be awesome,

37
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:29,780
next four terms, it's crazy competition, and you get your butt handed to you, okay?

38
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:33,660
So you've got to use, and guys, I didn't do this, for years and years I didn't do this

39
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,220
because I was never trained to do this, and I got into a lot of hot water, and this is

40
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,820
part of the reason I had to get rid of so many sites.

41
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:42,180
So you're going to take your list and you're going to take your core keywords.

42
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,740
Now, as I told you, you should only have five to seven, I don't know why we have nine here,

43
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:51,220
I'm only going to use five for this specific market research, and this is what I typically

44
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,220
do, okay?

45
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:56,540
So it's very, very simple, you got your document open, your market research worksheet open,

46
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:00,740
and then what I'm going to have you do before we jump in is I'm going to have you go and

47
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,700
go to the Google Chrome store.

48
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:08,980
If, let me say this, if you're not using Google Chrome, stop what you're doing and go download

49
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:09,980
Google Chrome.

50
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:13,660
You shouldn't be using Safari and Firefox and all these things, just trust me on this,

51
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,580
use Google Chrome, it's so much easier.

52
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:18,900
If you don't know how to download Google Chrome, go YouTube it, go Google it, you literally

53
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:23,220
could type in Google Chrome download, click download and it will walk you through it,

54
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,940
it is not hard, but if you have any problems, YouTube it, okay?

55
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:29,780
It's very simple, there's videos on everything, it's amazing and it's free, okay?

56
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:33,980
Go download Google Chrome and then what I'm going to have you do is inside of Google Chrome,

57
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:38,060
I'm going to have you type in Google Chrome store.

58
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:42,620
You're going to go to the Google Chrome store, click on the first link, and I'm going kind

59
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:46,980
of fast guys because I want to focus on the market research, not on all the little baby

60
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:47,980
steps here.

61
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:54,380
This is very simple stuff, Google Chrome web store, you're going to type in SEO Quake,

62
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,620
this is what is called an extension, okay?

63
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:02,260
It's free, type in SEO as in search engine optimization, Quake as in Quaker Oats, click

64
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:08,540
on it, click on this one that has the green, SEO Quake, and then it's going to say add

65
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:12,900
to Chrome, mine says remove because I've already added it, okay?

66
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,700
Click add to Chrome, that's it, and then what's going to happen is you're going to go back

67
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:20,460
over here, you're going to see this little guy right here, it might not show up in the

68
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:24,780
top so you might have to click this puzzle piece and underneath it you'll have to click

69
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:30,500
on this thumb tack and turn it blue, that means it's going to be pinned to the top of

70
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,940
your search bar so it's really easily accessible, I would recommend doing that and then it should

71
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,900
show up like this.

72
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,980
And that is all the setup you need so have your market research worksheet ready, have

73
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:43,860
your SEO Quake, have your keywords ready, and let's freaking shake and bake baby.

74
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:47,100
So now what you're going to do is you're going to go to your keyword list and you're going

75
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,900
to take your top five keywords and you're going to start plugging them in with the city

76
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:57,420
and state, so concrete, Queen Creek, Arizona, concrete contractor, Queen Creek, Arizona,

77
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:02,700
concrete company, Queen Creek, Arizona, concrete patio, Queen Creek, Arizona, concrete driveway,

78
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,480
Queen Creek, Arizona, and then I always like to throw in a little curve ball and I like

79
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:09,940
to take the first one, the main term, concrete, Queen Creek, Arizona, I like to take the city,

80
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:15,400
and I like to switch it and search it, so Queen Creek, concrete, okay, beautiful.

81
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,060
So now we've got five terms to look at and we're going to go and what we're going to

82
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:23,980
look at now guys, we're going to look at which companies show up in the map section over

83
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:27,620
and over and over for all of these terms because these are the terms that get the most search

84
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:32,900
volume guys, realize, like I hope you guys are following along, these terms that we decided

85
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:36,940
on, these have the most search volume nationwide.

86
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:42,460
Now we want to see in the specific city we're looking at what companies are showing up for

87
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:47,020
those terms, those are our competitors and then we want to look at those competitors

88
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:50,980
and see what kind of work are they doing, are they competitors because they're good,

89
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:54,560
are they competitors because there's no one else in the market, that's what we're looking

90
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,180
for is those cities where people are in the top spots by default, not because they're

91
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:03,200
doing something special, okay, so all we're going to do now is we're going to start looking

92
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:08,360
at common allies, so I'm going to start off with Bowman, Bowman shows up for number one,

93
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,680
Bowman shows up for number two, Bowman shows up for number three, Bowman shows up not for

94
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:17,280
number four, shows up not for number five, shows up for number six, so four out of six

95
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,040
I'm choosing Bowman and so what you're going to do is you're going to right click or you're

96
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,240
going to push command if you're on a Mac, you're going to open their website, you're

97
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,320
going to copy and paste this sucker over here into this sheet, so you're going to put it

98
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:35,120
once under the citations, once under the backlinks, once under the content, once under the domain,

99
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,640
let me explain this, the reason we are doing specifically looking at the citations which

100
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:44,400
I'm going to explain, the backlinks I'm going to explain, the content I'm going to explain

101
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,320
and the age of domain I'm going to explain is because these are the main factors when

102
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:52,160
it comes to ranking a website organically and in the maps and so those are the things

103
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:59,160
we want to look at, we don't care what their logo looks like, we don't care how much they

104
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:06,400
have, how many, I don't know, customer testimonials, those things don't affect ranking, we care

105
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,640
about how old is their domain, how much content do they have on their website, how many backlinks

106
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,520
they have and how many citations, I'm going to show you how to find all of them and what

107
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,480
they mean, how we can interpret them but for the sake of this what I want you to do is

108
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:22,920
go and find the next three companies that would fit inside of here that show up for

109
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:27,440
the majority, so if you have six terms that you're searching, one, two, three, four, five,

110
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:32,240
six, I want to know the company that shows up at least four out of six times, minimum.

111
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,920
Now if you start seeing and there's not any commonalities and there's different companies

112
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:40,720
every single time, that's actually a good thing, that means there's no steady, like

113
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,820
somebody that Google can rely on and so don't stress it, if you can't find anyone that shows

114
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:52,040
up for four out of six, find someone that shows up for three out of six and just don't

115
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,860
overthink it.

116
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:57,960
Another thing I want to point out is when you see the following which I have found,

117
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,620
this is my favorite thing, this is why I'm talking a little fast, getting a little excited

118
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:05,260
but when you see what I'm about to show you, you have found some freaking gold my friends

119
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:10,060
and what that is is you have a company like this, Copper Star Concrete LLC dash Steve

120
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:16,500
Wood, shout out to Steve, okay, you got Steve over here, homeboy does not have a website,

121
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:21,660
no website, it's 2022, he's ranking number one, question is does he rank for every single

122
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:26,060
search term or at least the majority, if he does, we have found some freaking gold baby.

123
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:32,300
Okay, so let's go to the first one, there's Steve, one out of one, there's not Steve,

124
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:38,500
so one for two, oh no, no there's Steve, two for two, there's Steve, three for three, Steve's

125
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:43,540
four for six, Steve made the cut guys, Steve's five for six, the only one Steve does not

126
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:48,380
rank for is the last term, throw Steve on the sheet guys, let's freaking rock and roll,

127
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:53,060
what you're gonna do here is you're just gonna copy his thing, like his whatever and you're

128
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:57,900
gonna go over here and boom, boom, I didn't even copy it, maybe just put like, you can

129
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:03,540
just put Steve, it doesn't matter, like you're just, you're literally just acknowledging

130
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:08,860
that this guy does not have a website which is absolutely asinine, I love it, it makes

131
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:13,780
me happy because what that means guys is Google, you gotta realize, Google's literally saying,

132
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:17,340
look at this, okay, Google's saying to me as a homeowner, because they think I'm a homeowner

133
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:21,740
I'm looking, right, I think I'm a customer, they're saying, hey Mr. Homeowner, you're

134
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:27,340
looking for concrete, well here's Steve, he's one of the top three choices in town, sorry

135
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:32,460
he doesn't have a website, you know, all that stuff, but he's your best, he's one of your

136
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:36,700
top three choices, that is garbage, that is absolute garbage, what that shows me is there's

137
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:42,020
a lack of competition and I love that, so if you guys see this, a web, sorry, a listing

138
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:48,020
that shows up for four out of the six or the majority of the terms, okay, have at least

139
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:52,820
five or more, and they do not have a website, you can almost guarantee this is gonna be

140
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:59,080
a yes, okay, almost guaranteed, I would even like venture to say it's a yes immediately,

141
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,900
but I'm gonna keep doing this, okay, so we're gonna add Steve and then we're gonna add another

142
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:06,500
one and then what we're gonna do guys is we're gonna go and find the information that's necessary,

143
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,660
so we're gonna find the citations, we're gonna find the backlinks, we're gonna find the content,

144
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:13,060
we're gonna find the domain, okay, the age of the domain, so what you're gonna use is

145
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:17,580
this SEOquake tool and all you're gonna do is go to their site, so remember how I opened

146
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:23,260
old Stevie's site, okay, inside of Steve's site this SEOquake tool should be showing

147
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:27,420
up, if it's not you need to go over here and it's probably toggled off, you need to make

148
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:32,580
sure that SEOquake is enabled and then you should see this, okay, if you don't it'll

149
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:37,440
typically show up underneath here as well, see how it's added it here, so you could actually

150
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:44,520
see it in the organic listings as well, it'll tell you L, that's the backlinks, it's gonna

151
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:50,800
tell you, where's the G, I'll have to show you another way to do this as well, it's not

152
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:56,080
showing the G which is the number of pages, the Google thing which I can show you a different

153
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:01,080
way of doing that, but very simply this one right here it says NA, why, because this isn't

154
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:07,080
even a real website, this is a WW1.bomanarchitecture, this is garbage, okay, so I'm gonna go and

155
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:13,520
I'm gonna put, you know, content, NA, because it doesn't even make sense, okay, I'm gonna

156
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:19,600
go back, L, that's number of backlinks, zero, I think you guys are seeing what I'm seeing

157
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:26,600
here right, zero, backlinks, boop, zero, awesome, domain, now the way that you're gonna go ahead

158
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,280
and find the domain, you used to be able to go like this and inside of SEOquake you could

159
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:35,440
click on the who is and then you could click I'm not a robot and you could click go, I

160
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,480
wanna show you something that's really funny based on what I said on another video, come

161
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,920
on baby, spinnin', let's go, okay, actually you can do this, it depends on the website,

162
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:48,680
you can do it this way, you're gonna scroll down and you're gonna look for, it says too

163
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:57,680
many requests, let's see, right here, created on 2018, it's 2018, boom, if this isn't working

164
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:05,680
for some reason, you can also go to something like duplichecker.com, just type in how to

165
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:10,480
find age of domain and you'll find something like that, but you just wanna find out what

166
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:17,480
year the domain was put live, what year the website went live, okay, and that's all you're

167
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,320
gonna do and then you're gonna do the citations, now the citations you're gonna go to something

168
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:29,320
called Whitespark, you can literally type in Whitespark.ca, you can get a free account,

169
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:36,200
so Whitespark.ca and you're gonna go and once you create a free account you're gonna hover

170
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:42,080
over this, right here, you're gonna hover over local SEO software, it's kind of a hover

171
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:48,160
and then go over to local citation finder, okay, and what you're gonna do is you're gonna

172
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:54,480
try it free, thank you SEO White Spark, okay, you're gonna try this free and you're gonna

173
00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:01,480
go over to searches, not campaigns but searches and then you're gonna go and type in new search,

174
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:07,240
okay, let me make sure I got this right, new search and you're gonna toggle this to business

175
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,680
search, and what we're gonna do is we're gonna go and I've already done Bowman so I'm gonna

176
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:15,680
do old Steve, I'm excited to see how many Steve has, old Copper Star Concrete, you're

177
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:21,440
gonna click on it and you're gonna copy this exact thing, okay, boom, we're gonna come

178
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,480
back over to Whitespark, business name, copy and paste, exactly, I know it looks janky,

179
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:33,480
it is janky, copy it exactly, okay, go back, copy the number, exactly, okay, Steve Wood,

180
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:41,160
you know what's crazy about this, this guy has a 435 number, guys, this is a, you know

181
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:47,440
this 435 is an area code that I have, that is insane, that is, well I did have, this

182
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:54,440
is a Utah area code, I'm loving everything I'm seeing about this, okay, so copy and paste

183
00:13:54,440 --> 00:14:01,440
it, sorry I'm a little bit behind here, boom, city, Queen Creek, autofill, AZ and push,

184
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,240
create search, this is gonna take a minute and it's going to spit out a result and it's

185
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,880
gonna give us the number of citations and we're gonna have this, so I want you guys

186
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,440
to do this for all of the three different people that you have found, so you should

187
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:20,920
have three, now, if you go through and it's Helter Skelter, there's only one that's consistent,

188
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:27,320
one of them has no website and the third one it's like, it's just like, there's no commonality

189
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:31,360
amongst all of your search terms, for example, you know, you can't see the same person showing

190
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:36,640
up twice, what I would do is I would go and dip into the organic and I would choose the

191
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:40,600
first company that's an actual company, not a home advisor, not an Angie's List, not

192
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:46,560
a BBB, but a company, so rock solid in this case, I would choose them and I would put

193
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:51,840
them right here and I would probably skip a row and put them under here, you know, copy

194
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:58,360
and paste it, I didn't even grab the domain, and I would say, you know, no consistent third

195
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:05,280
option, and then I would grab this guy, wherever he's at, and I would just go ahead and put

196
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:12,120
him here, oh boy, sorry, I'm in the wrong one, I've got to go right here, cool, I'd

197
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,480
put him here, I'd put him here, I'd put him here, and I would do the homework on this

198
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:20,200
one because there's just not three competitors, that also is a good sign, okay, so what I'm

199
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:26,320
gonna do here guys, I'm gonna pause this really quick, I am going to finish this worksheet

200
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,040
without making you guys watch me do it, I'm gonna come back, we're gonna assess it and

201
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:33,400
determine whether Queen Creek is a go or not, I can tell you right now it's already a go

202
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:39,480
because of Mr. Stevie Boy, okay, so give me one second, guys, here we go, I've got this

203
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,440
thing completed, I'm just gonna go through it really quick, so the companies I chose

204
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,640
was Bowman, Desert Installations, they were a company that kept showing up over and over

205
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:53,480
and over, they don't show up in the first term, but they showed up a ton, so I chose

206
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:59,240
them, and then the third one was Steve, which was that copper star concrete LLC Steve, and

207
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:06,880
yeah, that's what's interesting about this, so obviously if you look at this, I did all

208
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,520
the stuff I told you to, I found the backlinks for Desert Installations, they had two backlinks,

209
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:19,040
they had one page of content, their domain was 20-20, and then of course on Steve, there

210
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,760
was no backlinks because he didn't have a website, there was no content because he doesn't

211
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,840
have a website, and his domain was NA because he doesn't have a new website, so it was really

212
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:32,760
easy, okay, so how do we look at this, how do we assess it, I also found the citations

213
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:36,480
for these other companies, as I told you, this will spit you back a number, and you

214
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:42,340
just wanna list this number right here, and we can get into citations later, basically

215
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:47,640
just so you guys know, citations is the name, address, and phone number of the listing,

216
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:54,640
so for example, this right here, Bowman Concrete, this address, this phone number, it's the

217
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:59,560
domain, address, phone number, they call it the NAP, it's how many places around the internet

218
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:06,560
that exact matched NAP, exact matched NAP or NAP is listed around the internet, so places

219
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:13,560
like, yo, places like Facebook, places, they call these directories, they call these citations,

220
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:20,560
and it's listed exactly, so for example, Copper Star is listed in 14 places, exactly the same,

221
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:28,400
okay, Desert Installation, 11, and Bowman, 46, okay, honestly, I don't pay too much attention,

222
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,480
but it is nice to know when you start doing citations, which we're gonna get into later,

223
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:37,080
so how do we interpret this, well, the only other thing I like to do is once I do this,

224
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:42,280
I wanna know, okay, Bowman, you dirty dog, I wanna know where you're ranking, so for

225
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:49,280
example, on this first term, I wanna see if Bowman's on page one, no, no, no, not on page

226
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:54,560
one, okay, what about the second term, looking for Bowman's website, remember Bowman's website

227
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:59,440
here, which is an absolute junker, let's go ahead and grab it, if you wanna remember it,

228
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:05,760
Bowman Architectural, nope, nope, nope, nope, nothing, not on that one, okay, I'm looking

229
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:11,520
to see how many of these top three are actually showing up on page one, none, none so far,

230
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:18,520
okay, Bowman is not showing up for one term on page one organically, okay, nope, nope,

231
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:23,440
nope, I'm even on page two, nothing, okay, guys, this is a layup, I'm telling you right

232
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,240
now, it's a layup, and I have no plans of going into this, so the first person to watch

233
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:31,280
this video, if you wanna go grab this, this is a freaking layup, so check this out, let

234
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:38,280
me look at this last one, just in case, Bowman, where you at, dog, nope, so, no Bowman, so

235
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:45,320
what I'm gonna put here, I'm gonna go over and I'm gonna say, not ranking page one organic,

236
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:51,840
any terms, boom, now we're gonna go look at desert installation, and by the way, I already

237
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,720
know this, they're not ranking because I've looked, by the way, just to save the time,

238
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,720
desert installation is not ranking on page one for their website either, okay, so I've

239
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:06,720
already done it, they're not, so, and then Steve doesn't have a website, no website,

240
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:12,640
so how do we determine, how do we interpret this, well, here's the question, does this

241
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:18,240
niche look like low-hanging fruit, yes, and I'm not kidding you, I'm gonna stab about

242
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:23,240
six of these, 20 of these, 30 of these, I'm pumped about this niche, yes, now here's the

243
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:29,520
reasons why I'm excited, number one, Steve, who's a top competitor in the maps, does not

244
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,080
have a website, therefore he's not ranking on page one, therefore he's not a threat,

245
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:38,680
Steve is not doing well, and he is one of the top companies in Queen Creek, number two,

246
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:43,560
the other companies in here, for example, Bowman Architectural, well, number one, they're

247
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:47,400
like an architectural company, we wouldn't have that in the domain, number two, their

248
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:57,360
website is weird, they have no backlinks, it's just a weird site, it's not a traditional,

249
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:03,080
there's nothing, there's no content, it sucks, okay, and on top of that, they're not ranking

250
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:08,200
on page one, which is beautiful, and then desert installations, it's a brand new website,

251
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,520
if they're new, that's better for you, it means they're easier to outrank, Google, just

252
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:18,400
for the record, they like older websites, to Google, an older website means it's a company

253
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,080
that's gonna be in business for a lot longer, it's a more trusted company, and that's what

254
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,880
they like, so the fact that these are both newer websites really makes me excited, desert

255
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:32,120
installations also does not show up on page one, what this tells me is, guys, Google is

256
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:36,600
searching for somebody to put in the top spot in the maps, and in the organic, and no one

257
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,320
is doing what they want, no one's proving to Google, hey, I'm the guy, I'm the girl,

258
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,200
I'm the website, I'm the company, you should use me, you should put me at the top, they're

259
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:51,960
not doing anything correctly to incentivize Google to put them at the top, and therefore

260
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:57,060
there's a lack of options, and Google is putting some garbage companies, okay, there's probably

261
00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:01,720
good companies that do work in Queen Creek, but they don't know what they're doing online,

262
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:06,800
so what that allows us is an opportunity to come in with our freaking ninja tricks, build

263
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:12,120
a website, rank that sucker really rapidly, and capture those leads, and why does this

264
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:16,720
matter if we're gonna run ads, and we're gonna get the client first, because guys, if you

265
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,320
wanna do this long term, and you wanna rank this organically, you wanna see what kind

266
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,720
of work you're cutting out for yourself, right, because once I get the deal, now I'm gonna

267
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,040
go to work, now I'm gonna build a website, now I'm gonna do the content, and the backlinks,

268
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:31,680
and the whole deal, and I don't wanna get into a dog fight, I wanna make sure that we're

269
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:35,160
good, when I get the deal, I don't have to do that much work, guys, once I get a deal

270
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:40,360
in Queen Creek, build this website, or one of you does, this website with some decent

271
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:44,820
SEO is gonna rank in a matter of a couple of months, if not a couple of weeks, which

272
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:48,440
means you're gonna be able to turn off the ads almost instantly, so this thing is gonna

273
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:54,440
be a cash freaking cow if we can find somebody that will take these leads, that's already

274
00:21:54,440 --> 00:22:00,080
paying for leads, et cetera, so I just want you guys to understand, when you're doing

275
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:06,040
these things, take your time, if it is not an overwhelming yes, okay, and by the way,

276
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:09,760
this is kind of like a really extreme example, you don't come across these all the time,

277
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:15,440
that's why I'm talking so fast, I'm so pumped, but I want there to be no doubt in your mind

278
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,440
that this is going to be easy to rank, I do wanna mention one last thing, is if you see

279
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:25,320
that every company in the map, so let's say the top three companies, which in this case

280
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:32,320
was Bowman and Desert Installations and Copperstar, if you see that all three of those companies

281
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:38,120
that you've determined are the top three consistently, if they're all showing up on page one organically,

282
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:44,640
which again is below the maps, if you see that, run, that is not somewhere you wanna

283
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:51,360
be, that is a very competitive niche and city combination, so again, if all the competitors,

284
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,840
the top three people, after looking at all five terms, those three people are showing

285
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:02,840
up for the majority of the terms on page one organically, that's underneath the maps, run,

286
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:07,480
this is not worth your time, there's other cities and niche combos out there that are

287
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,920
gonna make, it's gonna make way more sense, it's gonna be way easier to rank, and you're

288
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:16,040
gonna make, you're frankly gonna make way more money, so for this one guys, I'm telling

289
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:21,520
you, this is an absolute freaking yes, I'm gonna build the landing page, I'm gonna run

290
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:26,520
the ads, I'm gonna get the deal, and we're gonna freaking get a website crankin' really,

291
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:33,520
really fast, I'm gonna lower the ads, and I'm gonna put some cheddar in my pocket, baby.
