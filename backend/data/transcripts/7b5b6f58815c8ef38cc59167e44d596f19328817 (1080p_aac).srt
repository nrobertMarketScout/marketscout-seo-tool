1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
What about when the client says for us it's all about conversion and to win the and then they through that

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,640
Let's see what happens with the free leads you sent us. That's a great question

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:14,320
I've covered this and I'm gonna cover this again. So one I've had this happen. I had this happen recently

4
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:20,420
In fact, I'll tag you in a video one. There's a video that I'm gonna share with you. So client says

5
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:26,280
They say hey, let's see what happens these leads. Okay, I did a

6
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:32,480
Specific lie for this thing was on a Friday two Fridays ago. So here's what I say is I say hey look mr. Business owner

7
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,360
If I sent you let's so let's say you've sent in three leads

8
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,400
I say hey if those three leads that I sent you if you close all three of those

9
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,440
Is it safe to assume you're gonna close a hundred percent of them?

10
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:50,360
Well, no, of course not. Okay. Well if you close zero of those three leads

11
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,520
Is it safe to assume that you're gonna close zero leads? Well, no

12
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,360
Okay, so the reason I'm bringing that up because

13
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:03,560
We can't base this off of three leads unless you're a hundred percent closer basing us off of three leads is the most

14
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,960
Short-sighted move we could ever make in the world

15
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:12,240
because and I say that say I work I've worked with some people in the past where I sent them ten leads they've closed zero and

16
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,360
Then the next ten leads they closed seven out of ten and they average almost 40% close rate

17
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,800
So I'm not sending you like that. I hope you didn't misunderstand me. Mr. Business owner

18
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:28,440
I'm not sending you guys this just so you could like and so I'm not gonna keep sending you leads for you to close the

19
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:34,720
Deal I'm sending you these leads so you can see the quality of the lead knowing that it is a numbers game

20
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:38,920
Okay, so I just don't want you to get confused. I'm sending you a couple whether you close them or not

21
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,320
That's on you. You don't have to pay me. Those are free. That's on you

22
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,160
But we need to talk in three days something like that because guys it's ridiculous

23
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,920
Like think about that think about like and I'm glad you brought this up dude

24
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:55,280
Like the people like what kind of balls these people have hey, thanks for the free

25
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,280
Like think about this. Hey guys

26
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,520
Hey one appreciate the free leads

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,360
Let me see if I make any money from those free leads to add further value to what you've already given me for free and

28
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:18,080
Then and only then will we talk then and only then will we do business on screw that person

29
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:24,360
Okay, so to me what that that might be like if you're getting that a lot and some people just have that in their mind

30
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,320
If you're getting that a lot, that's probably something that you're you're doing in the call

31
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,120
That first call where you need to kind of you need to do that pullback

32
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,640
You need to do what we talked about today with like this is a perfect example from today

33
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:44,080
Hey, like in your own way, you need to let them know that this this is not this isn't contingent upon them closing leads period

34
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,080
I'm sending you the leads so you can test them out

35
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,480
But this is a numbers game and I send you 20 leads

36
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:56,640
Okay, how many how many you how many free leads you want? Right? You're in business. I don't run a non-profit neither do you?

37
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,120
I'm gonna send you a couple

38
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:02,820
I'm happy to send you a couple more but we can't wait like if that's the game you're playing this isn't gonna work like

39
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,680
Be bold know your worth like that person right there if they say oh, well then this doesn't work. Cool

40
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,320
Walk away from that deal. This is a that's a perfect example of what we talked about today

41
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,960
Is this the kind of shit people pull I had that's it was Ricardo Ricardo's the one that did that shit to me

42
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,960
He's like hey, man. Yeah

43
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,840
We'll see what comes to these leads and then and then we'll talk no, no, no

44
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,600
That's not how so this does not work like that Ricardo wrong guy wrong place wrong time

45
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,160
And I said that exact thing I just said and I said no we're gonna talk

46
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,600
I'm gonna send you one more thing. We're gonna talk and then he goes to me cool

47
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,860
Go smell you want Ricardo, but I'm not doing business with you
