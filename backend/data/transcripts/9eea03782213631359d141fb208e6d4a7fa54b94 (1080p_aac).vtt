I love talking business. I love helping people make money because it helps me make money.

00:23.280 --> 00:27.680
Okay. I'm not the philanthropist. I'm not the guy that's going to say I like to help people.

00:27.760 --> 00:32.240
I like to help people make money because that's how I make money. So let's just clear that out of

00:32.240 --> 00:35.200
the way. But what I want to share with you really quickly to give you a little bit of confidence

00:35.200 --> 00:40.000
that you did make the right decision and I do want to thank you and tell you right now

00:40.000 --> 00:44.960
that I will make sure that you get far more value than you will ever spend with me. That is my

00:44.960 --> 00:49.520
commitment to you because I know how this works. I know that I need to help you get deals. You're

00:49.520 --> 00:53.840
here for one reason and that is to make money. You are here to get deals and if I can help you

00:53.840 --> 00:58.080
get deals, I'm therefore going to make money. Okay. But I want to give you a little bit of

00:58.080 --> 01:03.200
confidence and say this does work and I'm not talking about the case studies, which is social

01:03.200 --> 01:07.920
proof. I want to just tell you how this came to be really quickly. This is not something that a

01:07.920 --> 01:11.760
couple of months ago I sat down and went, you know what? There's a huge opportunity to make money

01:11.760 --> 01:16.880
and I'm going to develop this system and I'm going to sell it. No, what happened was in 2019,

01:16.880 --> 01:22.720
as you guys may or may not know, I was $60,000 in debt. I had two cars. I lived in a different

01:22.720 --> 01:27.600
house. I had a house payment. I had three kids and I had a really upset wife who didn't even

01:27.600 --> 01:33.200
know about that debt. I sat down and I looked at my situation and I looked at my goals and I was

01:33.200 --> 01:39.040
like, I want to make $100,000 a month. I can't do this. I can't work for somebody else. I have to

01:39.040 --> 01:45.520
own the thing. I have to own the business. I had been doing some version of a digital agency for

01:45.520 --> 01:52.000
years and years and years and I couldn't scale. What this is, what you're about to watch, what

01:52.000 --> 01:59.360
Flat Fee Mastery is, is it is the product of how I was able to go from a situation that was very

01:59.360 --> 02:05.840
dire to doing seven figures in a 12-month period. That is what this is. This is something that came,

02:07.200 --> 02:12.080
this was the solution to my problems. This is the solution to how do I scale up and hit the

02:12.080 --> 02:19.040
$100,000 per month goal that I had set for myself and that is how this came. I want to make sure

02:19.040 --> 02:24.400
that you understand this did not come as a way to make money. This came because I needed to get

02:24.400 --> 02:30.960
out of that really terrible situation and I figured out this thing called results in advance

02:30.960 --> 02:35.040
and this thing called running ads to a landing page and all these different little pieces of

02:35.040 --> 02:40.560
the puzzle and I started testing and I started tweaking and I started refining and I developed

02:40.560 --> 02:46.400
this process. I just want you to know that the reason that I can assure you that this works is

02:46.400 --> 02:49.920
yeah forget about the case studies, forget about all the people that I've already shown

02:49.920 --> 02:55.520
you that have tried this and made this work but this is exactly what I used to get out of my

02:55.520 --> 03:03.200
situation that was the catalyst to get me to where I am today. I believe the best products are those

03:03.200 --> 03:08.480
that were made as solutions. There were those that were made to solve problems, not the ones

03:08.480 --> 03:12.080
that were created, not products that were created just to make money and I'll tell you

03:12.880 --> 03:16.880
that this what you're about to jump into, what you're about to see, what you're about to go

03:16.880 --> 03:21.360
through was the solution that I came up with to my problems.
