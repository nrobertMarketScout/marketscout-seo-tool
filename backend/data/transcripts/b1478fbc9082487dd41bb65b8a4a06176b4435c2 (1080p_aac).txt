Okay. Marie says, I was doing a soft touch with the business owner today after handing off a lead and he was hardcore pressure me about price.
I held out the best I could but divulged that it would be a flat fee without a pay I ended up comparing it to being like him quoting a concrete job and it's the best case.
And that it's a case by case scenario. He was finally satisfied but is there something better I can say. Great question, Marie, I actually just filmed a video in module five this morning about this.
My go to when they keep going price price price price price guys write this down. I just try and go hey don't put the carpet before the horse we'll talk about that later but if they keep pressuring you for price.
Say look man. It literally depends on a lot of stuff. I have clients like just to give you a range I have clients that are paying me between three and 500 bucks a month, and I have a client to pay me $40,000 a month.
Okay, it's going to fall somewhere in there. No, but seriously, obviously it's going to be closer to the bottom and the top.
It's going to depend. And then go back to what you're talking about. Okay, give them a range. Okay, look bro I don't know. Okay, I don't know you're in a different city, you're in a different city than the other guy.
So I got to look at the competition, I got to look at what's going to take me, I don't have an answer for you but I do, I can tell you a range. Okay, and that's kind of how I throw it back on them and they're like, okay, cool.
Okay, so that's what I do I don't even bring up the floppy sounds like you said it in a way that didn't scare them so you're good.
