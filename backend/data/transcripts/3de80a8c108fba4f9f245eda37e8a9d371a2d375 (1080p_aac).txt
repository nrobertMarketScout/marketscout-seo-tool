He rebranded.
I'm thinking of reaching out to them, but it's in California.
You recommend against California and roofing.
So I'm wondering if it's two, just two bad things.

How is the competition?
How many leads are there actually flowing through that city?
Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

And then you can make that decision.
I don't think it's the worst thing ever.
I just think it's not the greatest use of your time if you have another option.
Okay.
