1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,480
Alright guys, it's time to close the deal and before we get into the script and we get

2
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,080
into all of that, I want to share something, I want to give an analogy and this is the

3
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,680
way I want you guys to think about the clothes, okay?

4
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,400
And there's a reason why this module is actually fairly short, you're going to find it's relatively

5
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,960
digestible and that is because to stress once again, the clothes happens in the setup.

6
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,260
The way you do the setup, the better you do the setup, the easier the clothes and so that's

7
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:42,400
why I want to show you guys that this part right here should be easy.

8
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:47,400
This part should be you guiding them through the process, collecting the card and going

9
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,400
on to the next deal.

10
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,600
This should not be a huge thing, okay, if you've done it correctly.

11
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,880
But I want you guys to think about baking a cake and so I haven't baked a lot of cake

12
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,600
in my days and I really haven't baked that much at all, but I want you just to think

13
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,900
about it because you can imagine, right?

14
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:10,520
With a cake you have a recipe and the closer that you follow that recipe, the better the

15
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,280
cake is going to turn out as long as the recipe is good, right?

16
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:19,400
So I want you to think about the recipe being the process and the cake being a sale.

17
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:25,460
So here's what's cool about this specific process is you have probably noticed as I've

18
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:29,140
interviewed people and as people have come through this program, you've probably seen

19
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:34,100
that most of them when I do the interviews, they say just flat out, yeah, I messed up

20
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,500
70% of what I was supposed to do.

21
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,860
I messed up 20%.

22
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,680
I didn't do anything right and I still closed the deal.

23
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,620
So the beautiful thing about this specific process, our process here in Flat View Mastery

24
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,940
is you don't need to do it perfectly.

25
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:51,300
You actually don't need to do it perfectly.

26
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,980
All your goal is is you want to follow this recipe, which is the process.

27
00:01:54,980 --> 00:02:01,100
You want to follow it as closely as you possibly can and the closer you can follow the recipe,

28
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:05,540
the closer you can follow the process, the more consistent your results are going to

29
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:06,540
be.

30
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,860
But what's interesting and what's crazy and what's pretty cool is that even if you don't

31
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:16,420
follow it exactly, you will still more often than not finish the process, finish the recipe

32
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,020
and you'll still have a cake.

33
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:23,260
And that's what's so cool about this whole process is we've seen people who do everything

34
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,260
wrong, right?

35
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:28,260
They don't get both business owners on the phone and they still close the deal or they

36
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:33,040
don't do the live transfer process correctly or they don't cover certain objections exactly

37
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,740
how they should have.

38
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:38,300
They don't do the zoom call at the right time, all these different things and they still

39
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,300
close the deal.

40
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:44,780
So I just want you to picture this, this entire process, but specifically this step.

41
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:49,860
We're trying to follow this exactly as it's laid out because I've done it enough times

42
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,260
where I know what the recipe is.

43
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:55,620
I know that if you do these certain things, you are going to get a deal.

44
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:59,220
So the closer you can get to following everything that I'm about to share and everything that

45
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:04,860
we've shared, we've shared up to this point, the more likely you are going to have the

46
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:09,460
same result every time, which is a nice, fat, juicy deal.

47
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,940
Do the best you can.

48
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,020
Don't sweat it.

49
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,780
Just send it every single time and you will get deals.
