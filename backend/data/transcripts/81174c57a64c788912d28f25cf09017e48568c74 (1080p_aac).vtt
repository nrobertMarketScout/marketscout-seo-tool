Hey guys, another question that comes in quite often, especially in the late fall and in the

00:06.480 --> 00:13.440
winter for certain niches, is you guys are seeing that your CPC is increasing. So let's say you set

00:13.440 --> 00:19.920
it up and your CPC top page bid is like eight to nine dollars and all of a sudden November comes

00:19.920 --> 00:26.320
around and you're noticing that it's like doubling or tripling in price. We do see this in concrete

00:26.320 --> 00:32.480
a little bit. Definitely a big factor in tree service and part of those reasons is just

00:32.480 --> 00:38.320
understanding these niches and understanding the cycle of those businesses. So I can tell you with

00:38.320 --> 00:44.640
tree service, typically the best time to trim a tree and or remove a tree is going to be in the

00:44.640 --> 00:50.400
fall and in the winter because the tree's not trying to grow, it's dying, it's kind of dead

00:50.400 --> 00:54.880
and stagnant. It's the best time to have somebody come out and lop everything off and trim it up and

00:54.880 --> 01:01.440
all that so that it has a better rebirth in spring. So those bids are going to be more

01:01.440 --> 01:06.000
expensive because this is when people are calling to have that service done. So it's just about

01:06.000 --> 01:10.720
competition, it's about Google making money, Google understanding the market space, but that's why we

01:10.720 --> 01:16.720
talk about you get these people for all year and you'll see that wave. It'll go high, it'll go low,

01:16.720 --> 01:21.040
but there's an average amount as well. So don't get too worried about it. If you see it go up,

01:21.040 --> 01:26.480
you'll typically see things like tree service, concrete, like spray foam, things like that.

01:26.480 --> 01:31.280
You'll see them come in in certain waves, but at the end of the year you'll kind of see that it

01:31.280 --> 01:34.320
kind of averages out.
