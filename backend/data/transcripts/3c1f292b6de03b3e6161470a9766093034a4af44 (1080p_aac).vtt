What social media accounts do you create, like Facebook business page, Instagram page,

00:04.000 --> 00:07.520
Yelp, to increase your chance of getting a GMB as part of creating a new city niche account?

00:07.520 --> 00:10.880
In other words, what are things you do to help improve Google acceptance?

00:11.840 --> 00:19.920
Guys, I don't spend a bunch of time with GMB anymore, okay, because to me,

00:21.520 --> 00:26.880
can you? Yes. Is it still possible? Yes. We actually recently got a GMB in the last two weeks,

00:26.880 --> 00:30.880
trying some new strategies, but I have not found anything that's tried and true that I'm

00:30.880 --> 00:35.760
confident saying, hey, here's the new strategy. What I've kind of opted to do instead is that

00:36.320 --> 00:41.520
I am going to focus on getting better at ads and getting better at organic rankings faster,

00:41.520 --> 00:46.400
okay, because guys, think about it like this. I've said this before, but you got to realize that

00:46.400 --> 00:52.160
when we have with Google, right, you can get leads from paid ads, you can get leads from

00:52.160 --> 00:57.600
the Google My Business or the local, and you can get leads from organic, and if you can get two of

00:57.600 --> 01:04.880
those three, you're going to be just fine. Back in 2020, when I was just trying to figure things out

01:04.880 --> 01:09.280
on more than half of my websites, or at least half of my websites, I didn't even have a GMB

01:09.280 --> 01:13.200
because it didn't click to me. It didn't occur to me that I could use the business owner's address.

01:13.200 --> 01:18.160
I didn't understand all this stuff, and so I was going along getting deals scaling up to $100,000

01:18.160 --> 01:23.520
a month, not realizing that I even needed a GMB. You don't need a GMB. Now, if you can get one,

01:23.520 --> 01:28.320
does it help? Sure, but even if I have them, I don't like to rely on them for leads because I

01:28.320 --> 01:32.960
feel like they're always problems. You're falling off, you're doing this, you're getting suspended,

01:32.960 --> 01:36.640
you're checking, checking, checking. So for me, I just decided, you know what, I'm going to focus

01:36.640 --> 01:40.880
on getting better at the things that I know how to do, which is ads and organic, and if we can get

01:40.880 --> 01:46.720
the GMB, great, if we can't, then whatever. However, I will tell you that yes, the Facebook

01:46.720 --> 01:52.480
business page does help, the Yelp page does help, but me personally, I'm just focusing on,

01:53.120 --> 01:57.520
I told you guys, I'm in simplification mode. I'm in, hey, these are the things I know that work,

01:57.520 --> 02:02.240
so I'm going to focus on them, and so that's what I've tried to put my effort on. That doesn't

02:02.240 --> 02:05.920
mean you can't, doesn't mean that's not a possibility, but that's where I'm putting my focus.
