1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
Let's go.

2
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:14,240
Before you actually get started and start the modules

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,500
and start picking niches and start going through everything

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,300
and go, go, go, go, and I know you're anxious,

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,100
I know you're excited, that's why we came here.

6
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,820
That's why we are here.

7
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:24,980
I want you to figure out a couple of things, okay?

8
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:28,580
And I need you to figure out what is the destination?

9
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:30,640
Where do you wanna go, okay?

10
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,600
So when I say where do you wanna go,

11
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,120
I mean how much money do you wanna make, okay?

12
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,680
How much money do you wanna make within 12 months?

13
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,820
Where do you wanna be by December 31st of this year?

14
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,820
Where do you wanna be 12 months from now?

15
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,600
Whatever that goal is, I wanna know where do you wanna be,

16
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,520
AKA how much money do you wanna make, by what date?

17
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,860
That's the first thing, okay?

18
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,500
And you need to get really clear

19
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,780
on how much money you wanna make.

20
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,580
You need to know the destination.

21
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:02,180
So let's just say you're sitting in the Midwest, okay?

22
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,640
Maybe you're in Arkansas, maybe you're in Iowa,

23
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,200
I don't know, whatever is classified as Midwest.

24
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,440
And you wanna go to LA, okay?

25
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,320
If you wanna go to LA, there's a lot of ways to go to LA.

26
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,080
You could fly up to Portland and go down, you could fly.

27
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,320
I mean, you could fly, first of all, you could drive,

28
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,840
you could scooter, you could walk.

29
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,680
There's a lot of different methods to get there,

30
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,940
but there's also a lot of different ways.

31
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:25,780
There's a lot of different routes.

32
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:28,200
You could go down, go to Phoenix, right?

33
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,440
There's a lot of ways, right?

34
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,280
But guess what?

35
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,160
There's one way that's the fastest.

36
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:36,280
And so what I need you to do is, first of all,

37
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,320
we gotta know the destination.

38
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,700
We gotta know what you're aiming for,

39
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,600
because if you don't know you wanna go to LA,

40
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,480
you're gonna wander, okay?

41
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:46,100
So I need you to know how much money do I wanna make

42
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,400
and by what date?

43
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,800
And it needs to be by a specific date.

44
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,520
So we need to figure out what that is,

45
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,520
and then we need to have a plan

46
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,680
for how we're gonna get there.

47
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:59,640
Meaning, okay, if I wanna get to $10,000 in six months,

48
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,060
how many deals am I gonna need to do at what price per,

49
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,860
like how much am I gonna need to charge the client

50
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,060
at what profit margin?

51
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,660
How am I gonna get to $10,000?

52
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,660
Is it $10,000 profit?

53
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,620
Is it $10,000 gross?

54
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,300
I need you guys to figure out

55
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,660
and get clear about what you want, okay?

56
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,660
And so if you haven't already,

57
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:25,320
I need you to go watch the video titled Exhausted,

58
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,900
but Satisfied, and we will definitely,

59
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,860
it will be linked somewhere around this video.

60
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,940
I need you to watch this video,

61
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,540
and I need you to set your destination,

62
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,740
put a time on when you wanna get there,

63
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,620
and then I need you to create a plan,

64
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:41,460
AKA a map, for how you're gonna get there.

65
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,620
And I want you to be so clear

66
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,420
that if I were to come and scare you in the middle of night

67
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:47,620
and shake you and say, hey, hey,

68
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,700
what do you need to do today

69
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,820
to get to your goal by Christmas,

70
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,140
or to get to your goal that you set

71
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,420
on December 31st, New Year's Eve?

72
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,420
What do you need to do today?

73
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,060
And I want you to be able to go, oh my gosh,

74
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,820
I need to set up this many campaigns,

75
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,540
and I need to talk to this many business owners,

76
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,060
and I need to close out this percentage,

77
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:03,900
and I need to do this.

78
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,980
I want you to know so clearly

79
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,860
that I can wake you up in a dead sleep,

80
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,780
and you know exactly what you need to do.

81
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,700
Because guys, the problem with most people

82
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,660
is that they spend a crazy amount of time,

83
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,520
majority of their time on activities

84
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,480
that do not get them closer to their goals, okay?

85
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,480
And they do not move the needle.

86
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,400
And so before we get going,

87
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,520
I need you guys to set the destination,

88
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,560
put a timeframe on that,

89
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,000
and create a map of how we're gonna get there.
