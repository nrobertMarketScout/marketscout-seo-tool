What parts of the closing script would you say are the most important to emphasize?

00:03.360 --> 00:08.480
Most important thing with the closing script, Porter, you got to get in and you got to figure

00:08.480 --> 00:12.640
out what drives them. You got to get in and you got to figure out at the very beginning,

00:12.640 --> 00:16.880
why are they doing the business? Because at the end of this, the end of the call,

00:16.880 --> 00:21.840
when they start to waft and they start to shake and they start to, let me call you back,

00:21.840 --> 00:26.240
or I don't know if it's worth it, you can go back to the thing that they said at the beginning

00:27.040 --> 00:31.840
and you can hit back on that. I remember a couple months ago, I had somebody I was talking to

00:32.400 --> 00:38.240
and we dug in, we dug in, we dug in and I found out pretty early on that they were like,

00:38.240 --> 00:47.120
I want to blow up my business because, and this is a real story, because I'm so tired of my sister

00:47.120 --> 00:52.080
not believing in me and every time I go home, she's talking crap about me and saying I'm not

00:52.080 --> 00:57.360
going to make it and I'm on to the next thing and I'm so tired of that and I was able to find that

00:57.360 --> 01:02.560
up front and at the end when there was like, oh, I don't know if this is worth it, whatever,

01:03.200 --> 01:10.480
I reminded this person, I said, dude, how many more family dinners are you going to go to

01:10.480 --> 01:16.800
and have your sister laugh at you? How many more family dinners are you going to go to or Christmas

01:17.440 --> 01:21.280
get togethers you're going to go to where you're the laughing stock of the family, right?

01:22.240 --> 01:27.440
And I knew that's what drove that person and I was able to hit on that and at the end,

01:27.440 --> 01:32.080
and it was like, yeah, you're right, let's do this, let's freaking do this. So the most important part

01:32.080 --> 01:37.440
of the entire script is figuring out what drives them, period, right? Because if you've done the

01:37.440 --> 01:42.000
lead part correctly and sent the leads, you've done most of the selling already. If you've overcome

01:42.000 --> 01:47.520
the objections beforehand like you should have, I mean, that is most important is figure out what

01:47.520 --> 01:51.680
drives them, figure out why they're in business and then you can always at the end, that can be

01:52.000 --> 01:58.080
your thing that you use to close. And guys, do not hop off the phone with a maybe. Somebody

01:58.080 --> 02:02.960
tells you they'll call you back, say, hey, sir, ma'am, I appreciate you, but if it's a maybe,

02:02.960 --> 02:07.120
that's a no for me, okay? I need somebody now. I need somebody that can commit and if this isn't

02:07.120 --> 02:11.520
100%, after I've sent you three to five leads, after you've made money on my lead, if that's the

02:11.520 --> 02:15.120
case, after I've shown you that I'm going to give you these exclusively, I've shown you how I got

02:15.120 --> 02:19.440
the lead, we've spent a couple hours on the phone. If this still is a no-brainer and look at the

02:19.440 --> 02:22.400
numbers that we talked about on the lead value calculator, if it's still not a no-brainer, it's

02:22.400 --> 02:27.520
a no. Because what you're telling me is you are not confident in your ability to close and that is

02:27.520 --> 02:31.840
not somebody I can work with. So if this makes sense, which I think it does and you know it does,

02:31.840 --> 02:36.640
let's do this right now. If it doesn't, then let's know, but I don't do call me back later,

02:36.640 --> 02:42.400
shit. That's not how we roll. You want to do that with the Dish Network guy, that's fine.

02:42.400 --> 02:46.720
The carpet cleaner guy, that's fine. I work with one company and of course, this is going to be

02:46.720 --> 02:52.320
in your own tone. This isn't the douchebag Nick Wood way that he does it. I don't do maybes,

02:52.320 --> 02:58.400
okay? A maybe is a no. It's either yes or no. It's not yes or maybe or no. It's yes and everything

02:58.400 --> 03:01.120
else is a no.
