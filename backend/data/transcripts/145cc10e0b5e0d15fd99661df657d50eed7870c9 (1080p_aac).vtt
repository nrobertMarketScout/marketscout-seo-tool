00:00.000 --> 00:14.480
So why do we use paid ads? Well, I'm gonna tell you. I'm gonna share a quick story. If

00:14.480 --> 00:18.400
you guys haven't heard the story already, great. If you have, bear with me for just

00:18.400 --> 00:23.180
one moment. 2019, I realized in order for me to hit my goal, my goal at the time was

00:23.180 --> 00:28.380
I wanted to get to $100,000 per month in revenue. And I realized I couldn't do that being a

00:28.380 --> 00:33.780
salesman for somebody else. I couldn't do that by being an employee. And so I'm like,

00:33.780 --> 00:38.020
I gotta figure this out. But at the time, I had about $8,000 in revenue coming in. I

00:38.020 --> 00:44.540
had SEO deals. I had a little bit of lead gen and I had some paper lead, had no commission,

00:44.540 --> 00:48.660
and had one or two flat fee deals. And I took inventory of my stuff and I almost forgot

00:48.660 --> 00:53.220
about these couple of flat fee deals. And I looked at it and I'm like, dude, these guys

00:53.220 --> 00:57.220
have been the most low maintenance of any of them. So why don't I do more of that? And

00:57.220 --> 01:00.460
I'm like, okay, it's got to be that. It's got to be that flat fee stuff because in the

01:00.460 --> 01:04.580
winter it's not going to go down. I'm going to be able to calculate everything. It's going

01:04.580 --> 01:09.180
to be the same, you know, it just made sense to me. Okay. So I started realizing, I'm like,

01:09.180 --> 01:15.580
I'm going to do the math. How do I get to $100,000? And I'm like, okay, well, I know

01:15.580 --> 01:19.980
that if I build a site today, it's going to take a minimum of three to six months, three

01:19.980 --> 01:25.140
if I'm really good at doing my due diligence, six if I'm okay. And if I do a bad job, I'm

01:25.340 --> 01:27.860
going to need to spend 12, 18 months before a site ranks. Started doing the math. I'm

01:27.860 --> 01:31.700
like, I'm going to need this many sites and this much ranking and assuming this many don't

01:31.700 --> 01:36.580
work, I'm going to need to spend a lot of money every month to scale this puppy up.

01:36.580 --> 01:41.060
And so I figured out, I'm like, okay, well, you know, and by the way, just so everybody

01:41.060 --> 01:45.620
knows, I heard of this concept. I wasn't the first one to invent it. And this whole strategy

01:45.620 --> 01:49.220
of giving leads in advance, Costco invented it and probably somebody before them. But

01:49.220 --> 01:53.420
I heard of this idea of why don't you run a little bit of ads to juice it up? Why don't

01:53.420 --> 01:56.180
you run a little bit of ads to get the phones ringing? And I'm like, that's a, that's a

01:56.180 --> 02:02.020
great concept. And so I started running with it. And so in 2020, the beginning of 2020,

02:02.020 --> 02:05.780
that's when I really took hold of this concept. I'm like, Hey, what if we could use other

02:05.780 --> 02:09.660
people's money to scale? What if we didn't actually need to build the website before

02:09.660 --> 02:13.420
we got the deal? What if we could set up a landing page, push traffic, get the lead,

02:13.420 --> 02:16.900
get the deal and then build out the property? What would that look like? And so that's why

02:16.900 --> 02:21.060
we use ads. We use ads to speed up the deal. So if you have a site right now and it fits

02:21.060 --> 02:25.700
the criteria for module one and it's producing consistent leads, you probably don't need

02:25.700 --> 02:29.620
to run ads. Okay. The thing that I like about it though, is it does speed up the deal. It

02:29.620 --> 02:34.260
does allow you that let's say the winter comes and it gets a little slow on the organic side,

02:34.260 --> 02:38.900
pop in the ads and it supplements. You know what else I like about it? GMB goes down,

02:38.900 --> 02:42.460
throw in the ads, supplements it. Okay. So there's a number of reasons, but the number

02:42.460 --> 02:46.820
one reason is we are trying to speed this process up. So I'm going to share really,

02:46.900 --> 02:52.660
briefly three reasons, the three main reasons why I love running ads. Number one reason is speed,

02:52.660 --> 02:56.580
as I've already mentioned. Okay. I don't know about you, but I ain't got four to six months

02:56.580 --> 03:00.660
to wait for a little towing site or a little, I shouldn't even say towing. I hate towing.

03:00.660 --> 03:05.780
A concrete site, a tree service. I don't have four to six months to wait. I want to hit my goals

03:05.780 --> 03:11.060
today, baby. I don't want to wait. Okay. So by running these ads, it's allowing us to put up

03:11.060 --> 03:17.540
a landing page, push ads, get calls today, sell today or tomorrow or the next day, get the deal

03:17.540 --> 03:22.980
and then build out and be making money the entire time. Number two reason is this is going to allow

03:22.980 --> 03:28.820
us to scale. Okay. A lot of you are in the same position I was in in 2000, the end of 2019,

03:28.820 --> 03:34.820
beginning of 2020 where it's like, yeah, I get this. I love it. I'm sold, but I don't have the

03:34.820 --> 03:40.340
money to build out a hundred sites and time, you know, hosting times a hundred, call tracking

03:40.340 --> 03:47.460
number times a hundred, whatever, hosting domain, all this times a hundred. Okay. I didn't have the

03:47.460 --> 03:53.700
money. I don't want to have to pay a VA times a hundred to go and do the backlinks and the content

03:53.700 --> 03:58.740
and all this stuff. I don't, I didn't have the money. So if you want to scale, the best way to

03:58.740 --> 04:04.740
scale in real estate, physical real estate and in digital real estate is called, it's by using OPM.

04:04.740 --> 04:11.220
Other people's money. So by using ads, it allows us to get the deal upfront, use the money from the

04:11.220 --> 04:16.740
deal to build out the property that we own, the asset and to scale the sucker up. Number three

04:16.740 --> 04:21.700
reason is this allows us to test. This is the third reason we use Google ads. Okay. So what do I mean

04:21.700 --> 04:27.300
by that? Well, it allows us to actually put up a one pager that takes a couple of minutes, 30 minutes

04:27.300 --> 04:31.300
to an hour, set up an ad, which take us a couple of minutes, 30 minutes to an hour until you get

04:31.300 --> 04:35.940
fast at it. I can do it in five minutes now. It allows us to spend a couple of bucks, probably up

04:35.940 --> 04:41.460
to a hundred and we can go and test out a market. Meaning maybe the tool that we looked at, maybe it

04:41.460 --> 04:45.780
was mangles, maybe it was keyword planner, maybe it was SEMrush, maybe the tool said there's volume,

04:45.780 --> 04:50.020
but maybe there's not because these tools aren't always accurate. I'd rather spend a hundred bucks

04:50.020 --> 04:56.260
in two days of my time than I would spend six months of my time and heaven knows how many

04:56.260 --> 05:01.300
thousands of dollars just to find out there's no volume. I'm ranked number one whoop-de-doo.

05:01.300 --> 05:06.020
There's no, there's no volume. There's no people calling or worse. There's no hungry business

05:06.020 --> 05:10.020
owner. So if I get in, I can set this thing up quick. I could spend a hundred bucks. I get a lead.

05:10.020 --> 05:14.340
Okay, cool. I know there's volume. And now I can use that lead to go start calling around and see

05:14.340 --> 05:19.220
if there's actually hungry business owners in the area. Guys, I love this so much because

05:20.020 --> 05:25.700
it allows you to almost go into the future, say, Hey, in theory, if I did have this thing ranking,

05:25.700 --> 05:29.780
if it was producing, would there be somebody that would pay for this? Yes or no. Okay, awesome.

05:29.780 --> 05:33.380
There's leads coming in. There's business owners that are hungry. Let's fricking do this. Those

05:33.380 --> 05:43.620
are the three reasons why we use Google ads. Let's dive in and get some ads set up, baby.
