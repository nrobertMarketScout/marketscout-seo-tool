So Bruce had found a city niche combo that looks great,

00:02.540 --> 00:04.780
but only found six businesses advertising in the area.

00:04.780 --> 00:06.620
Is this still a go or move on?

00:07.580 --> 00:11.920
Six businesses, I'd still go for it.

00:11.920 --> 00:14.900
I mean, if you are, it shouldn't,

00:14.900 --> 00:17.220
I mean, look, I've gone into cities

00:17.220 --> 00:20.820
that there's been three or two and I've gotten deals.

00:20.820 --> 00:22.620
What we have to remember guys,

00:22.620 --> 00:25.700
is it is still possible to close people

00:25.700 --> 00:28.300
that aren't currently paying for ads or leads.

00:28.320 --> 00:29.980
That's still a thing, right?

00:29.980 --> 00:32.480
Like I feel like before I started talking about it,

00:32.480 --> 00:33.720
people weren't even looking at that shit.

00:33.720 --> 00:35.700
It was just like, we're just going into whatever.

00:35.700 --> 00:38.300
So yes, you can close people that aren't paying.

00:38.300 --> 00:40.400
It's just easier when they're paying for Google ads.

00:40.400 --> 00:42.800
And then it's easier after that paying for people

00:42.800 --> 00:44.800
that are paying, finding people that are paying

00:44.800 --> 00:46.160
for home advisor and then Angie's leads.

00:46.160 --> 00:48.440
And then it goes down, boom, boom, boom, boom.

00:48.440 --> 00:51.480
So at six people paying for it, yeah, bro, send it.

00:51.480 --> 00:52.920
No big deal, just send that thing, dude.

00:52.920 --> 00:53.820
Gotta get in those reps.

00:53.820 --> 00:55.900
And I'm guessing if there's not anyone paying for ads

00:55.900 --> 00:59.400
or only six people, then maybe your CPC is really low.

00:59.400 --> 01:01.800
And if nothing else, you get your reps in, okay?
