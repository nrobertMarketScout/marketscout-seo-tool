1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,680
Alright, now that we have the frame and we added the content, we interlinked everything,

2
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:14,200
we are going to do the on-page SEO.

3
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,040
Let's start with the page title.

4
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:22,160
So the page title is, I have our Bentonville Concrete website up here.

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:28,920
The page title is what comes up when you hover at the very top of the website.

6
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:37,820
So we like to keep the page title between 50 to 60 characters and to add that on Weebly,

7
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:44,500
so we select, we're going to do this for every page except for the contact as page.

8
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:51,760
We are going to do it but it's not going to be to SEO because the contact page, we don't

9
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,240
really care for the ranking as much as the other pages, we don't add content, it's just

10
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,200
a way for people to submit a form.

11
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:05,080
So you're going to click on pages, you're going to click on the home one, right here

12
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:12,720
under and don't get it confused with the page name, that's just the home, go into SEO settings

13
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:22,160
and up here in the page title, we usually like to do service comma service comma location.

14
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:31,000
So for our website it would be, and again you can pick the keywords that are most representing

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,380
of your business, the ones that rank the most are the ones with the most volume in search

16
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,580
that you probably want to have for the home page.

17
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:51,120
So concrete contractors and then concrete, we could even do company, Queen Creek is a

18
00:01:51,120 --> 00:02:01,240
pretty long location, so let's see if, and then make sure you add the state, let's copy

19
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:16,280
this and ward counter, okay, we usually use the wardcounter.net, it's pretty easy, okay

20
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:22,560
Okay, we're 55 characters, so we're good, and then let's do the ones for the other service

21
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:29,700
pages, I have a stamped concrete right here, so obviously the page title for that is going

22
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:48,000
to be stamped concrete, stamped concrete, we can do like decorative concrete, you want

23
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,860
to really pay attention to how you're spelling things, make sure you're putting everything

24
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:59,820
in the word counter too, to make sure you're not going over 60 characters, let's do concrete

25
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:11,540
driveway, let me see what we did here, okay, I'm actually just going to put it in here

26
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:28,180
so I don't have to copy and paste it, so let's do concrete driveway, concrete dollars, okay,

27
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:34,980
that works, let's copy and paste it, pretty easy, especially once you have your keyword

28
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:44,620
extended and you know exactly what you want to target, and then let's do concrete patio,

29
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:48,860
the first keyword should be fairly simple, if it is too long for the location and you

30
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:53,540
don't fit two keywords, just pick one keyword if that's the case, it's always better to

31
00:03:53,540 --> 00:04:13,020
do less than to go over, okay, so could do walkway or sidewalk, really again just look

32
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:17,400
at your keyword list and the ones with the highest volume that are related to the content

33
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,520
that you're going to add to the page is what you want to put, so definitely if you have

34
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,640
a homepage for concrete patio, you definitely want to put concrete patio in the page title,

35
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:31,920
and then the second keyword I would probably do whatever it is that has a high search and

36
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:41,800
you're going to talk about in that page, concrete patio, and make sure you publish, you need to

37
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:47,200
publish everything, and then for the contact page we usually like to keep it simple, so I would

38
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:57,000
probably just put contact, Queen Creek, concrete, and then make sure you publish, save everything,

39
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,040
and you're done.
