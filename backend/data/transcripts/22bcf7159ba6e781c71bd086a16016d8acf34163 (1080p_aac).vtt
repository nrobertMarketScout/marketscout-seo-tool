WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:14.780
All right, so once we've let the business owner know who we are and we've done this

00:14.780 --> 00:20.240
miniature transition into what we're doing, giving them a damn good reason, we're going

00:20.240 --> 00:22.340
to now explain why we're calling.

00:22.340 --> 00:25.840
We got to let these guys know, or these ladies, guys, whatever, we got to let them know why

00:25.840 --> 00:28.920
we're calling and why it's important they listen to us because we're interrupting their

00:28.920 --> 00:29.920
day.

00:30.320 --> 00:31.320
They do not want to be interrupted.

00:31.320 --> 00:35.000
You got to give them a damn good reason, and it better be different than everybody else.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.920
Now I do want to mention this.

00:37.920 --> 00:42.160
I know that in this entire process, as I've talked about, and I've mentioned this before,

00:42.160 --> 00:49.080
that we talk about the transition at the end of the hook, but there's also miniature transitions

00:49.080 --> 00:54.160
in between each step, and so here's what's cool about this, is after in the first step

00:54.160 --> 00:58.340
when you ask the three questions, you pattern, interrupt, tell them who you are, typically

00:58.340 --> 01:00.700
what's going to happen is the business owner at some point is going to cut you off and

01:00.700 --> 01:02.540
go, wait, wait, who are you?

01:02.540 --> 01:07.460
Basically what they're saying is, who the hell are you, why are you calling me?

01:07.460 --> 01:11.460
You didn't mention who you are, are you a real estate agent, are you a contractor trying

01:11.460 --> 01:14.620
to send me work, is this your house?

01:14.620 --> 01:19.780
They're going to ask something of that version, or some version of that, and that's going

01:19.780 --> 01:24.620
to be a perfect opportunity for you to just segue, transition directly into what you're

01:24.620 --> 01:25.620
doing.

01:25.620 --> 01:26.620
Here's the steps you're going to follow.

01:26.620 --> 01:28.900
Once they ask that, let's pretend that they do that.

01:28.900 --> 01:32.260
What we're going to do now, and when we're explaining this, we're going to ask a couple

01:32.260 --> 01:33.260
things.

01:33.260 --> 01:35.180
We're going to say a couple things.

01:35.180 --> 01:38.260
First of all, we're going to tell them our name, and we're going to tell them that we

01:38.260 --> 01:41.460
have a website in this city.

01:41.460 --> 01:47.820
Then we're going to tell them that we do not have a company, but that we have jobs.

01:47.820 --> 01:50.100
We don't have a tree company, per se.

01:50.100 --> 01:54.180
We don't do tree work, we don't do concrete work, but we have jobs coming in every single

01:54.180 --> 01:55.180
week.

01:55.180 --> 01:59.340
Then we're going to tell them that we call them specifically because we saw that they

01:59.340 --> 02:05.540
were paying for leads, or paying for ads, or paying for whatever, or did this.

02:05.540 --> 02:10.700
We know that that means they're hungry to grow, and then we're going to transition into

02:10.700 --> 02:11.700
the deal.

02:11.700 --> 02:14.540
What does that look like?

02:14.540 --> 02:16.820
We get done, they're like, hey, so who are you?

02:16.820 --> 02:17.820
Oh, sorry.

02:17.820 --> 02:19.660
By the way, Jack, my name is Nick.

02:19.660 --> 02:27.060
The reason I'm calling you is because I have a website here in Austin, here in, we want

02:27.060 --> 02:33.620
them to know that we're local, I have a website here in Austin that gets three to five concrete

02:33.620 --> 02:38.820
jobs every single week, and I don't do concrete.

02:38.820 --> 02:46.420
I have a website here in Austin, here in St. George, here in whatever, and I don't do concrete,

02:46.420 --> 02:48.260
but it's getting X amount of jobs.

02:48.420 --> 02:51.820
If you don't have a site already, you're just doing a pre-sell, don't say more than three

02:51.820 --> 02:55.700
to five, because three to five is a really safe number that you're going to expect off

02:55.700 --> 02:56.700
of ads.

02:56.700 --> 03:01.780
If you have a site that's been producing for years, and this sucker's pulling in 20 a week,

03:01.780 --> 03:05.500
go ahead and say it, but let's not oversell this from day one.

03:05.500 --> 03:08.060
Let's not oversell at all, but especially not from the first conversation.

03:08.060 --> 03:12.340
Hey, I got a website here in Austin, it's getting three to five concrete jobs every

03:12.340 --> 03:17.180
single week, and I don't do concrete.

03:17.180 --> 03:18.180
We said that.

03:18.220 --> 03:23.340
The reason I'm specifically calling you, Jack, is I noticed you're paying for Google Ads,

03:23.340 --> 03:29.260
so I know that you are hungry to grow, or at least I assumed you would like a job.

03:29.260 --> 03:33.220
I assumed you'd be happy to take on this job that I have, I have this lady named Janet,

03:33.220 --> 03:34.220
whatever.

03:34.220 --> 03:36.020
That's it.

03:36.020 --> 03:41.540
We're just going to, and this step right here, we have to let them know why we are calling,

03:41.540 --> 03:42.540
what we're doing.

03:42.540 --> 03:45.220
Got to give them that reason.

03:45.260 --> 03:48.460
Those are the main things that I like to hit is, they're going to cut you off in the middle

03:48.460 --> 03:52.660
of step one, transitioning to step two, they're going to ask who the hell you are, and you're

03:52.660 --> 03:56.060
literally just going to tell them, hey, sorry, Jack, my name's Nick, I have a website here

03:56.060 --> 03:58.740
in Bentonville, Arkansas.

03:58.740 --> 04:00.860
Don't say Arkansas, because that makes it sound like you're out of state.

04:00.860 --> 04:03.940
I have a website here in Bentonville, it's getting three to five concrete jobs every

04:03.940 --> 04:05.180
single week.

04:05.180 --> 04:10.140
I specifically found you on purpose, because I saw you're paying for Google Ads, so I

04:10.140 --> 04:14.300
already know you're hungry to grow, and I'm looking for someone to take on these jobs,

04:14.380 --> 04:16.940
or I'm looking to work with somebody on an ongoing basis.

04:16.940 --> 04:19.740
I don't actually have a concrete company.

04:19.740 --> 04:22.380
You notice how when I explained that the first time, and now I explained it the second time,

04:22.380 --> 04:25.900
I said that differently, but it was the exact same thing.

04:25.900 --> 04:29.500
It's not about saying the exact phrase, and by the way, I'm going to give you guys, there's

04:29.500 --> 04:33.700
going to be a PDF, there's going to be an exact script that you can follow, but I want

04:33.700 --> 04:39.260
you to notice, you can say things multiple ways, and still convey the same message.

04:39.260 --> 04:43.900
Sometimes I'll first tell them I don't have a company, but I have jobs, sometimes I have

04:44.500 --> 04:46.940
jobs coming in, and I'll forget to mention I have a company.

04:46.940 --> 04:52.940
The main point is, you want to be honest and direct and say, hey, I don't have a company,

04:52.940 --> 04:57.660
I got jobs coming in, I have a job right now that's hot as hell, it's ready to go.

04:57.660 --> 04:58.660
Notice how I didn't even said that.

04:58.660 --> 05:02.140
This is my third time kind of explaining it, and this is the first time I'm saying I have

05:02.140 --> 05:05.540
a specific job right now.

05:05.540 --> 05:07.700
I don't want you guys to stress so much.

05:07.700 --> 05:11.700
I'm going to give you the exact script, I just want to break down the important points

05:11.700 --> 05:12.700
to hit.

05:12.940 --> 05:14.940
We talked about the first part, which is who you are.

05:14.940 --> 05:17.500
The second part is why you're calling them.

05:17.500 --> 05:20.420
You have to have a good reason, and it has to make sense.

05:20.420 --> 05:25.340
What makes sense to me, if I put myself in their shoes, is, hey, this kid has a website,

05:25.340 --> 05:30.020
he's getting jobs, he doesn't actually have a concrete company, and he's calling me because

05:30.020 --> 05:32.500
I'm already spending money on ads so he knows that I'm hungry.

05:32.500 --> 05:34.740
That makes sense to me.

05:34.740 --> 05:39.780
By the way, Jack, I have this lady named Janet, she's at Silver Beach Circle, she needs a

05:39.780 --> 05:42.020
tree removed.

05:42.020 --> 05:44.860
This is where we're going to transition into the deal.

05:44.860 --> 05:49.460
And so, I have this lead, her name's Janet, that's our transition.

05:49.460 --> 05:52.860
We're going to then transition into the third step.

05:52.860 --> 05:56.940
So guys, don't overthink it, I just want you to get through these videos.

05:56.940 --> 06:01.300
In the last video of this module, I'm going to give you an example from A to Z, and it's

06:01.300 --> 06:05.820
going to be as closely as I can following the script.

06:05.820 --> 06:09.980
But I'm telling you guys, I've done this so many times, I've said it so many times, it's

06:09.980 --> 06:14.980
just ingrained in my mind, and sometimes I mix up the order.

06:14.980 --> 06:16.220
Sometimes it just flows differently.

06:16.220 --> 06:19.620
I know the steps, I know the things, you have to tell them who you are, you have to tell

06:19.620 --> 06:22.940
them what you're doing, what the deal is, you have to transition.

06:22.940 --> 06:26.580
But sometimes they're out of order, and it's okay because it sounds more natural.

06:26.580 --> 06:33.340
So step two of the perfect prospecting script is a damn good reason why you're calling,

06:33.340 --> 06:38.820
and tell them exactly, not mincing words, why it is that you're interrupting their day.
