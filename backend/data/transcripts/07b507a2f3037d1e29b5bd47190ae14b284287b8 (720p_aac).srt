1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,200
Okay guys, officially welcome to today's call, it's February 11th, 7 a.m. and today we're

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:12,560
going to be talking about closing on the first call.

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:17,080
Really really quick though guys, just a couple things I want to cover.

4
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:23,160
First of all, if you're not in the Rank and Rent Academy, if you are in this group, you

5
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,400
have free lifetime access as long as you're of course a member of this group, you get

6
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,080
access to the Rank and Rent Academy.

7
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,080
There's nothing in there that you're not going to get in here, this is where you should spend

8
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,080
your time.

9
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,040
However, I will tell you that there's some people I can see right now that are on this

10
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,600
slide that are taking advantage of the things in that group.

11
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,100
Every single Monday at 7 a.m. I go live and I do a Q&A.

12
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,100
Every single Monday.

13
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:52,560
Now, I will tell you there are things that I refuse to cover in that group because those

14
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,400
people, the ones that are not in this group have not paid for that knowledge.

15
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,360
For example, yesterday we had somebody ask a question about ads and I told them, hey,

16
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,520
you want to learn ads?

17
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,280
You got to pay the piper, you got to pay me, who's paid the piper?

18
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,720
So I'm not going to cover ads.

19
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,360
But there's a lot of other stuff that we cover and so if you guys have questions, you guys

20
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:17,440
want more FaceTime with me, you guys have paid to be here and so you get access to that.

21
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:24,760
It's funny, that call is actually dominated by Digital Landlord students so it's amazing.

22
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:30,720
It makes me happy because I'm able to help you guys from this group inside of that group

23
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,720
as well.

24
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:35,960
Okay, so that said guys, that is every single Monday at 7 a.m.

25
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:42,320
If you do not have access to the RankinRent Academy, message, not Francesca, message Ashley,

26
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,320
she'll get you access.

27
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,320
Okay?

28
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,840
A couple quick things about the RankinRent Engine tool.

29
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,320
First and foremost, if you don't know what that is, go to RankinRentEngine.com, it is

30
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,680
the only tool that you need for this business.

31
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,440
You do not, number one, you do not need any tools to make money.

32
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,440
Okay?

33
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,680
Just going to say that out front, you do not need any tools to make money.

34
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:08,280
I was able to cobble about eight different tools together and I was able to make my money.

35
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,280
But it was a pain.

36
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,360
I spent a lot of time, I spent a lot of effort, I actually spent a lot of money trying to

37
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,360
figure it out.

38
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,840
But I want you guys to know this is not something that you have to do.

39
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,840
It does make things a lot easier.

40
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,840
Doing due diligence.

41
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,600
I was talking to somebody yesterday that was doing, that is in RankinRent Engine.

42
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,880
They're like, yeah, I've already looked at 50 cities, 50 cities, you know how long it

43
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,880
takes to look at 50 cities?

44
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,880
It takes about 30 minutes.

45
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,440
When you first start, probably takes an hour.

46
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,400
But let's say you get good at it, it takes 30 minutes, 30 minutes times 50, do the math.

47
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,400
That's how long it takes to do 50.

48
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,240
This guy just busted them out, okay?

49
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:44,840
But on the business of Rare, a couple things that you should know.

50
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:50,120
Number one is there, if you go in, you log in, there is a user metrics dashboard that

51
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,120
is now live.

52
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,240
You can see your progress.

53
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:56,200
You can see your, you know, did my revenue increase, decrease, clients, all this different

54
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,200
stuff.

55
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,320
It is, it's a great like snapshot of your business.

56
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,320
So that's live.

57
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,360
That is a new feature or a new view that we've added.

58
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,760
Also, I've said this a few times with the backlink analyzer 1.0 is live.

59
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,000
When I say 1.0, we are going to be beefing that up.

60
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
We're going to be looking at that for, we're going to be able to, we're going to allow

61
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,240
you guys to be able to look at the backlinks of your competitors from different views,

62
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,240
not just the root domain.

63
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:25,280
But for now, you can go and you can jam in the root domain of any of your competitors

64
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,640
or any website at all.

65
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,680
And you can go and take a look at the backlinks, okay?

66
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,720
So the backlink analyzer 1.0 is live.

67
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:35,480
And then one other cool thing, we're trying to keep everything into one place to make

68
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,480
it as easy as possible.

69
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,960
So you guys can have your, your browser open, you have rank and rent engine, you have Google,

70
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,680
you know, you're doing some, some searching on different cities and, and that's it.

71
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,960
You don't have to have a million different softwares open that are all talking.

72
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,520
We're also adding the, the lead value calculator inside of rank and rent engine.

73
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:59,920
Now I, for those of you that were on yesterday on the rank and rent Academy call, I thought

74
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,920
it was completely live.

75
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,200
We've just sent it into production.

76
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,000
So within the next week or two, that will be live.

77
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Okay.

78
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,480
Anyway, just want to give you guys some updates on that.

79
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,480
It's exciting.

80
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,480
We're making changes.

81
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,480
We're moving.

82
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:17,320
And anybody that has any recommendations, anything they'd like to see done to that tool,

83
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,320
please email me.

84
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,560
My, my email is nick at digital landlords.com.

85
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,760
You guys can send me an email, send me a, Hey, I would like to see this done.

86
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,840
I'd like to see it do this.

87
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:31,320
Like for example, we had somebody yesterday from this group that was asking about a quick

88
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,560
little duplication button.

89
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,880
So I take that, I forward it over to Ryan and we can jump on that as soon as possible.

90
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,400
So guys, I'm super excited about that.

91
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,720
We've brought that to you.

92
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:44,800
That is somebody from this group, Ryan Dalton, who not only build a software, but he's scaled

93
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,880
up to a hundred thousand dollars per month in less than two years.

94
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,560
And just in case anyone's wondering what his numbers are.

95
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:58,040
So Ryan Dalton, by the way, everyone should, should give Ryan some, some love in the comments.

96
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,040
I know he's not on this call right now.

97
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,560
He's, he's probably got a million things going on, but a dude went from zero to a hundred

98
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,640
K a month in two years, kept his job.

99
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,920
Okay.

100
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,760
Also as a family has a regular life.

101
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:14,280
He's not just like, you know, let's say Elon Musk that just got divorced three times.

102
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,320
He's kept all that.

103
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,080
And they built rank and run engine on top of that, which is unbelievable.

104
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,200
So his breakdown, he's making a hundred thousand bucks per month.

105
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:27,280
Eighty six thousand of that is purely Legion.

106
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,840
So he's making over his run right now is over a million dollars a year just on lead generation.

107
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:39,040
The remaining 14, 15,000 that he's making is a combination of SEO and some PPC management

108
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,280
on some ad stuff.

109
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,280
Okay.

110
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:46,880
The way I always look at it, guys, is if somebody else is out there that can do it, somebody

111
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,480
else out there that bleeds red, you can do it.

112
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,480
Okay.

113
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,360
That's the way I always look at it is somebody else can do it.

114
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,360
I can do it.

115
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,240
There's no difference between me and Ryan.

116
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,560
There's no difference between me and anybody else.

117
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,340
Differences is they're figuring, they figured out how to use leverage and how to focus on

118
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,520
one thing for a longer period of time.

119
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,520
That's it.

120
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,720
So that's exciting for me when I ever, I see anyone that's way ahead of me.

121
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:11,020
If I see someone that's making a million dollars a month, well, then of course it's possible

122
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,020
for me.

123
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,020
Okay.

124
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,300
So anyway, guys, that's the updates on Rank and Run Engine.

125
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,940
For those of you, because I have one or two people every time that message me, I'll drop

126
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:19,940
this in the chat.

127
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:22,980
We have a discount code for anyone that wants to check that out.

128
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:29,180
Let me go ahead and drop this really quick if I can find my browser.

129
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,180
There it is.

130
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,180
New landlord, discount on rare.

131
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,180
All right.

132
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,700
With that said, I want to, I just want to say one thing and then we're going to get,

133
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,700
I'm going to get Kyle on here.

134
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:41,500
We're going to be talking about closing on the first call.

135
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,900
I want you guys to think for just a moment, okay, about a time, whether it was in this

136
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:51,580
business or it was just a time in your professional life or maybe it was just in your regular

137
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,580
life.

138
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:58,820
But like, I want you to think about a time when, and Kyle Patton, Mr. Frickin' 6'9",

139
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,580
I want you to do the same if you're listening.

140
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:05,580
I want you to think about a time that you were just humming.

141
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:06,860
Time was on your side.

142
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,860
Everything was clicking.

143
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,140
You guys know exactly what I'm talking about.

144
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:11,540
It's like you're excited.

145
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,300
It feels like you're making deals.

146
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,180
You're closing deals all over the place.

147
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,300
Everything's going your way.

148
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:21,300
Obviously, it's not easy, but you're just, you have the energy, the excitement to keep

149
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,900
going because things are happening.

150
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,180
You're seeing progress.

151
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,180
Everything's just clicking.

152
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,180
Okay.

153
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:31,100
Again, preferably if you could think of a time in this business, I can think of a time.

154
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,100
That's 2020 for me.

155
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,100
Okay.

156
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:36,260
But that was the first time I really, really felt it.

157
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:39,180
And I want you to ask yourself the following questions because this is what I've been asking

158
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,740
myself all of this year.

159
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:42,740
Okay.

160
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:48,500
Number one, have you stopped doing the things that got you to where you are today or that

161
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,780
got you to the success that you are thinking about?

162
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,180
Okay.

163
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:56,260
Have you stopped doing those things that got you that success?

164
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,260
That's question number one.

165
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,340
This is rhetorical.

166
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,900
You can answer if you want.

167
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:05,700
Secondly, on the flip side, have you started doing things that you weren't doing when you

168
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,620
had the success?

169
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:11,220
Example, you weren't watching Netflix every single night.

170
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,220
Now you are.

171
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:15,980
I want you to legitimately think about that.

172
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:20,100
Have you stopped doing the things that got you where you are today or that got you to

173
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,780
that success?

174
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:26,820
Have you started doing things that you weren't doing when you had the success?

175
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,860
So guys, the reason I'm bringing this up is I'm talking to myself because at the end

176
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:35,620
of last year, I realized that the very things that allowed me to create two seven-figure

177
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:43,980
companies in three years, literally all the basic little tiny things that I was doing

178
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:48,900
that got me the success of creating two seven-figure companies, I had stopped doing.

179
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:55,260
I slowly stopped doing last year and it's embarrassing to say, but I have to own it.

180
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,340
It happens slowly over time.

181
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:01,900
You stop doing your weekly planning and all of a sudden you stop doing your company meeting.

182
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:05,220
Then you start doing this.

183
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:09,620
You start going out on Tuesdays or going out on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday instead

184
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:13,460
of saying, hey, I'm just going to go out on Saturday, I'm just going to go out on Friday.

185
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:16,620
For me, 2020, I was super scrappy.

186
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,620
I was hustler.

187
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,660
I was willing to do things that were unscalable.

188
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,900
I was willing to jump on a sales call at 7 a.m. on a Saturday morning.

189
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:27,580
I actually chose to schedule a sales call every Saturday morning at 7 a.m. just to get

190
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:31,260
my butt out of bed and just to get me in bed Friday night.

191
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:35,460
I was willing to jump on sales calls at 11 o'clock at night.

192
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,780
I was willing to miss events.

193
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:41,980
I was willing to give up golf and pickleball and all these hobbies to get the deal.

194
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,020
I was scrappy, man.

195
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,020
That was what I did.

196
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,340
I was reading 10 pages of a good book.

197
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:53,180
All these little things that got me into this success, I had completely stopped doing.

198
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:56,900
It became very apparent just two months ago in December.

199
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:57,900
I just looked at my life.

200
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:58,900
I took inventory.

201
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,980
I'm like, what am I doing?

202
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,660
I stopped doing all of those things.

203
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:05,140
I had started watching Netflix during the week.

204
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:09,340
I'd started spending time during the workday doing hobbies when I should have been working.

205
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:14,220
I started taking meaningless calls that weren't getting me closer to my goal.

206
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:18,900
I started going out on the weekdays instead of just the weekends.

207
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,740
Guys, on January 1st, I made a commitment.

208
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,780
I'm like, I'm cleaning this up.

209
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:24,780
I am done.

210
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:27,220
I'm going back to the basics.

211
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:32,060
I went live yesterday and I told you guys this, but guys, January, and shout out to

212
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,620
Kyle who's going to jump on, he crushed it.

213
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:40,540
We had the biggest month we had in over 12 months, probably further than that, but we

214
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:45,340
January than we had all of 2024 in any of the months of 2024.

215
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:47,100
By the way, my internet looks a tiny bit glitchy.

216
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,100
I apologize.

217
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,380
We're going to just roll with it.

218
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:54,400
So guys, don't forget what brought you the success in the first place.

219
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,980
Do not forget, and I'm not trying to be motivational, whatever.

220
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:00,140
I'm just speaking to myself.

221
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:02,980
Don't forget those things that got you the success in the first place.

222
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,220
It's all those little things that add up.

223
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,220
I promise you that.

224
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:08,620
So with that said, let me get Kyle on really quick and let's talk about closing on the

225
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:18,620
first call.

226
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:21,660
Real quick, David Dale, is Rankin' Red Academy separate from Digital Landlords?

227
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,660
David Dale, yes.

228
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:25,460
Rankin' Red Academy is separate from Digital Landlords.

229
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:31,380
Rankin' Red Academy is basically like the equivalent of our old Facebook group.

230
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:34,580
And by the way, you can message Ashley, you can be a part of it, you can go and build

231
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:38,540
the community, whatever, but you do not need Rankin' Red Academy.

232
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:43,540
If you're looking at spending time in Rankin' Red Academy, and here, this is a trillion

233
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,060
times better, right?

234
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:49,420
The only reason I'm talking about Rankin' Red Academy is we have a live call on Monday

235
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:50,420
7 a.m.

236
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:56,180
If you want some extra time with me, you want questions answered from me, jump on 7 a.m.

237
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,180
MST.

238
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:01,860
There's a link in the calendar section inside of the Rankin' Red Academy, and you guys can

239
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:06,660
go and access that, but don't for one second think that you need access to that.

240
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:09,820
It is free for you guys, but I would rather you spend your time here, because this is

241
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,700
where all the juicy stuff is.

242
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:16,220
Kevin Mija's on, Nick Kudlick, another St. George guy's on, what's up, dude?

243
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,220
Laura Shepard's on.

244
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,220
Kyle Patton, what's up, bro?

245
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,220
What's happening?

246
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,220
Can you hear me?

247
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,220
Yeah, I can hear you.

248
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,220
Amazing.

249
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:27,700
Okay, Kyle, you're going to give me 13 seconds while I go close my door before you guys keep

250
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,700
hearing my kids.

251
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,700
Hold tight.

252
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,700
You know the drill, bud.

253
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:35,700
Go ahead and welcome the people.

254
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:43,140
You know, this is not my, dude, just sit here and talk in front of people that I can't see.

255
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,620
But what's up, everybody?

256
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:48,700
If you got sales questions, start dropping them in the chat.

257
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:54,700
All right, bud, don't worry.

258
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,700
I'm back.

259
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,820
This is not Kyle's cup of tea, so give him a shout out.

260
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,820
This is my cup of tea.

261
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:03,940
Kyle, I promise you, you start doing this regularly, bud, it will become your cup of

262
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:04,940
tea.

263
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:07,060
I don't think so, man.

264
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:12,500
So guys, Kyle, let's see a couple things about Kyle.

265
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,380
Let's give it for anybody that doesn't know Kyle.

266
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:17,300
You should know Kyle because you spoke with him to get in this call.

267
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:20,780
If you didn't, you're one of the rare ones that talked to me, maybe talked to Francesca

268
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:23,020
because Kyle was on a hunting trip.

269
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:27,540
But Kyle, how long have you been doing sales, Kyle?

270
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,540
Since 2015.

271
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:32,100
2015, he started doing door to door sales.

272
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,780
Was it two years you did door to door sales?

273
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:36,060
Yeah, two years door to door.

274
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:43,140
Two years door to door sales, then since then, since 2015, all you've done is sales.

275
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,140
Right.

276
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,140
Yep.

277
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:51,660
And you've sold everything imaginable, short of like magazines and like shoe cleaner, right?

278
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,660
Anything and everything.

279
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:53,660
Yep.

280
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:54,660
Yeah.

281
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:58,220
So just to kind of give you guys a little bit of an idea, Kyle, we sold alarm systems.

282
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:02,720
Then we sold a software that we pre-sold a software that never became a software.

283
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:08,040
So that is impressive in and of itself that we sold something that never was anything.

284
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,440
We didn't know at the time.

285
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:15,880
Then from there, we tried to sell, what was it?

286
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:21,160
We tried selling SEO services, some paper lead, lead gen services.

287
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,440
Then Kyle and I had like a falling out.

288
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,440
Long story.

289
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,440
We'll share that one another day.

290
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,440
It was good.

291
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,160
Kyle went and where did you go work?

292
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,880
What did you go do sell?

293
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,320
Software for storage facilities.

294
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,320
Yeah.

295
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,080
Kyle went and sold software for storage facilities.

296
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:40,560
But even before that, he was selling like those cartoon infographic things, right?

297
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,560
Yeah.

298
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,560
Yeah.

299
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,560
Why draw?

300
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,240
Don't forget about this, bro.

301
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,520
You sold those two.

302
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:49,120
Dude, Kyle has sold everything.

303
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:57,140
Finally I was able to convince him in, what was it, 2022 to come back to the promised

304
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,140
land.

305
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,140
And here he is.

306
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:03,340
Guys, Kyle is an amazing resource for you guys.

307
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:08,940
The good thing about Kyle is he has a very different sales style than myself, where I'll

308
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:13,660
say things that can maybe get under people's skin or maybe a little bit too, they're a

309
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,460
little bit on the edge.

310
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:21,300
Kyle, I don't think, have you ever made anyone upset on a call?

311
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,300
I try not to.

312
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,300
I don't think so.

313
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:27,620
I'm sure there's been a couple, I've ruffled some feathers, but it's pretty rare.

314
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:28,620
Yeah.

315
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:34,980
I like it because for a lot of you guys, it's way more relatable to the way that he sells.

316
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:41,260
And he's actually, so obviously you guys know he's the one that brought you guys in here.

317
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:46,420
Kyle has brought in, how many students have you brought into this program?

318
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,980
Just over 500 now.

319
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:48,980
Just over 500.

320
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,220
So we have like, what, close to 800 students, right?

321
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,220
Something like that?

322
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,220
Yeah.

323
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,220
So close to 800.

324
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,540
So Kyle's brought more people into this group than I have.

325
00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:00,860
So Kyle has in the last two years has done far more sales than I have done.

326
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:05,220
So anyway, I just want you guys to know that back story, to know that he is a very credible

327
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:08,700
person when it comes to sales, he's been, I bet you he's done more sales calls than

328
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:13,840
I have at this point because he's done so many, he's doing multiple per week.

329
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:18,140
So anyway, let me just kind of set the background.

330
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:23,540
And by the way, Kyle, just for everyone to have an idea, like you didn't grow up doing

331
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,540
sales.

332
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:29,740
What you did before sales just to paint a picture.

333
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:37,140
Yeah, I grew up working kind of on a neighbor's farm and then worked at Cal Ranch in high

334
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:43,940
school and then painted houses for like six years, worked for a fencing company.

335
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:49,800
So pretty much all physical, physical labor, manual labor kind of jobs, nothing, nothing

336
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,800
within sales.

337
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,800
Yeah.

338
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:56,520
When I met Kyle trying to convince him to do door to door, he was doing house painting.

339
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:00,280
So he was just a regular like blue collar dude.

340
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:05,480
And the only reason that I knew he would do well is we had a mutual friend that was like,

341
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,640
hey, you should hit my buddy up, Kyle.

342
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:12,400
And I could just tell Kyle, I'm like, dude, if this guy is willing to paint houses, then

343
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,600
he's going to crush it at door to door sales.

344
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:19,420
And I remember he was like pretty apprehensive because I don't, has anyone in your family

345
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:22,180
ever done sales or anything like that?

346
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,180
No.

347
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,180
Yeah.

348
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:28,300
And it's like a taboo in Utah, you know, it's like you serve a mission, then you go

349
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:32,260
do door to door sales and everybody thinks door to door sales is just a scam.

350
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,140
So that was like my biggest hesitation.

351
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:39,460
Yeah, I still, Kyle made me drive up to like four hour drive, like two or three times before

352
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,980
he finally agreed to come and do door to door sales.

353
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:43,980
So dude, let's do this to start.

354
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:44,980
This would be fun.

355
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:49,180
And by the way, today we're going to be talking about closing on the first call, getting someone

356
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,940
on the zoom, not letting them off, getting a yes or no.

357
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:54,660
But Kyle, let's from what you can remember.

358
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:59,180
So we recruited Kyle back in 2015.

359
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:03,260
And we were like, Kyle, come out to Vegas, come out to Henderson, Nevada.

360
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:06,740
Let's go do some sales training before we just go to Arkansas.

361
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:07,740
So Kyle comes out.

362
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:10,140
Kyle, do you remember the first deal that you landed?

363
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:17,220
Yeah, that old guy, Russ Russell, you never forget the first deal, you know what I mean?

364
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,700
So I just remember I put Kyle in this neighborhood.

365
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,900
He was burning doors, dude.

366
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,660
I mean, you went through like three neighborhoods in three days.

367
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,660
Oh, I was just cooking.

368
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,460
He was just calling me every day.

369
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,100
He's like, yeah, I finished the neighborhood.

370
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,540
I'm like, bro, there's like 57 homes in there.

371
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:35,100
What do you mean you finished the neighborhood?

372
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:40,220
So finally on Saturday, he gets in this house with this old guy.

373
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,340
And I can't remember what happened.

374
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:45,460
Somehow I came over the house, dude, and we we we wield and deal, dude.

375
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:48,900
It was like it was like one of those deals you get on, you pitch at a thousand bucks

376
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:49,900
a month.

377
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:53,260
You end up doing it for like five hundred a month and your ads are four hundred.

378
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,940
But you got the deal.

379
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,700
And that was Kyle's first deal.

380
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,100
And he went on to make some great money for the next two years.

381
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,660
And then here we are.

382
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:04,860
So anyway, guys, let's talk about this.

383
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:10,340
When I first started doing door to door sales, and I'm sure you were the same, Kyle, I would

384
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:14,260
get the objection like I want to think about it.

385
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,500
Leave me with your card, all that kind of stuff.

386
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:23,260
And I remember like when I first, first started, I was like, OK, that sounds good.

387
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,260
You'll call it.

388
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,460
So you'll call me tomorrow.

389
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,600
OK, sounds good.

390
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:31,140
And I take the card and they're like, yeah, Nick, you did such a good job on the presentation.

391
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:35,260
Like if I can give you a rate or review, I'd love to talk to your manager, Kyle.

392
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,260
How accurate is that?

393
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,260
What?

394
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:40,180
Like, is that the same thing that you experienced right when you first started?

395
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,180
Yeah.

396
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,180
Yep.

397
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,180
Nonstop.

398
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:48,460
When we started doing this, like the equivalent would probably be like, well, it sounds good.

399
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:53,300
So I'm going to talk with the team and I'm going to get back with you.

400
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,300
Right?

401
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,300
Yep.

402
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,180
How many of those deals do you close, dude?

403
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:01,220
Like, would you say percentage wise, if when somebody says, let me think about it, I'm

404
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:06,240
going to, I'm going to check the I got to check the numbers, whatever the thing that

405
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,240
comes out.

406
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,240
It's always I want to think about it.

407
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,740
What percentage just letting them right off the hook?

408
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:13,100
Would you say that you close like you do close some?

409
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:16,940
Genuinely speaking, if you let everyone off the hook, there's going to be a small percentage

410
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:17,940
that you do close.

411
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,300
But what do you think that percentage is?

412
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,300
Yeah.

413
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,300
Probably like 5%.

414
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,300
5%.

415
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:26,300
And you know what the worst part is, is that that 5% ruins you.

416
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,300
Right?

417
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,700
I get you thinking like, oh, that guy came back.

418
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,700
I'm just looking.

419
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,700
I think Sean's on here.

420
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:38,300
Sean and Gina, I know they're going to comment because they were one of them that ended up

421
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,300
coming back.

422
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,300
But it's very rare.

423
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:44,620
It's more often they either go here, you know, give you the whole pitch of why they're not

424
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,620
doing it.

425
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,620
100% man.

426
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:51,620
So there's a book called The Psychology of Selling and it's by Brian Tracy and he talks

427
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:57,260
about like, whenever we get done with a sale, we think that the prospect just, you know,

428
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:01,500
we get done off the zoom, Kyle calls me, he's like, hey, they're really excited.

429
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:06,420
And in our heads, we think that the person, the prospect is over there, you know, just

430
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:10,820
doing the pros and cons, thinking about joining, thinking about working with us on our lead

431
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:15,860
gen system, thinking about expanding all of Northwest Arkansas or all of Dallas, Fort

432
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,620
Worth and tree service.

433
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:21,260
And the reality is, dude, as soon as they hang, the reality is that they already made

434
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:23,300
up their minds is actually the truth.

435
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:27,380
But if they haven't, for some weird reason, the second they get off within five minutes,

436
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:30,300
they know that like what they're going to do or they know what it is on the call.

437
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:33,860
They're just looking for a reason or how to tell you how to do it.

438
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:37,100
And so, guys, what you need to understand.

439
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:40,860
And I'm going to say this like that, I'm going to say this very boldly because I've seen

440
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:41,860
it so many times.

441
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:42,860
This is not from theory.

442
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:43,860
This is not from reading books.

443
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:48,100
But I promise you, if you guys are just letting people think about it, letting people leave

444
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:52,940
you with their virtual card or either we're going to call you tomorrow, guys, it is, that

445
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:57,020
is literally, it is financial suicide, okay?

446
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,820
The prospect is not going to call you back.

447
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:04,060
The prospect is probably going to text you an hour later, five hours later, 24 hours

448
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:07,700
later, and they're going to send you some long message of why this isn't a good fit

449
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,700
for them.

450
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:09,700
They're going to hold off.

451
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,700
Okay?

452
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:14,460
The other thing that you don't realize is when you let the customer say, I'm going to

453
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:19,500
think about it, I'm going to get back with you, you are literally relinquishing all control.

454
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,060
You no longer have any control.

455
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:26,940
All you are now is a puppy dog that's following up with somebody who you're begging for money.

456
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:27,940
Okay?

457
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:31,980
So guys, when I started doing door-to-door sales, I kept getting this and I couldn't

458
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:32,980
figure it out.

459
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:36,140
I was like, I was not consistent closing.

460
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:38,460
I'd get to the end of the call and I would just cross my fingers.

461
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:42,660
I'm like, I would go for the close and if they did it, I was like, oh my gosh, thank

462
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,660
goodness.

463
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:47,060
If they didn't, then I didn't know what to do.

464
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,380
I tried all kinds of different stuff.

465
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,620
I was listening to Grant Cardone.

466
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:53,220
I tried to do these hard closing techniques.

467
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:57,900
And then guys, this is what changed everything for me is one day I was sitting in a training

468
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:02,020
and we had, I think I've told you guys this before, but we would do a training.

469
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:06,500
If you didn't sell the day before, you would have to go to this training where basically

470
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,500
you were shamed.

471
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,260
It was called the bagel meeting, right Kyle?

472
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:12,020
Which the bagel means you didn't sell.

473
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:16,540
And these bagel meetings, how many people would show up to these things?

474
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:21,180
I mean, it depended, but the energy was dog crap, right?

475
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:25,860
It's like all the people who didn't sell, that made no money, it's like imagine you

476
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:30,620
went all day, you knocked seven hours, eight hours of doors, and then they're like, you

477
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:33,300
have an extra meeting tomorrow at 10 a.m.

478
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:36,900
Dude, energy is like terrible.

479
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:44,780
So I'm in a training meeting one day, a sales training meeting, and our trainer, he proposed

480
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:49,180
this idea and he's like, I want to teach you guys this.

481
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:53,100
And he came up with this concept, he's like, I want you guys to have this mindset.

482
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:57,580
I want you guys to start implementing this thing where you say to people, and maybe whether

483
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:02,020
it's out loud or in your head, I don't do comebacks.

484
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:06,220
Or essentially meaning, I don't do, I want to think about it.

485
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:09,500
And I remember when he said that, I was like, yeah, right, bro.

486
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:13,100
Like there's no way, like, you know, I can think of all these different excuses.

487
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:17,060
Like you're asking me at 20, how old were you, Kyle, when he did this, do it in ourselves,

488
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,060
25?

489
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,060
Yeah, 25.

490
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:21,940
25, I think I was 23, 24.

491
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:26,860
Like you're asking me to ask 40, 50, 60 year old men, 30 year old men with huge houses,

492
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:31,220
like they have to make a decision, I don't do comebacks, like it was a really bold idea.

493
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:34,620
And I was like, there's no way I'm going to be able to do that.

494
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:39,020
But basically, the idea that he proposed to put in our head is that you get an answer

495
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:45,860
yes or no on the spot, and you'd rather take a no than you would a maybe, and that you

496
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:50,380
are bold with the customer and say, I do not do comebacks, okay?

497
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:55,860
So I know, Kyle, when I told you about this concept, I don't know if it was me, it could

498
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:58,180
have been one of our other managers.

499
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,820
Did you think that that was a crazy, crazy move?

500
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:02,980
Do you even remember when we came up with this, or did we just train you like that from

501
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:03,980
the beginning?

502
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:04,980
I don't even remember.

503
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:09,780
Yeah, that was just trained like from the beginning, but it was still a wild idea.

504
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:12,020
It's the same thing.

505
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:16,740
You're almost confronting these people and saying you have to be bold with your stuff.

506
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:17,740
It's hard.

507
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:21,660
Especially like it's much easier to where we're at.

508
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,860
This is why I'm always like, guys, you don't know how good you have it.

509
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:27,820
Imagine you go in like a little freaking puppy dog door to door in these big neighborhoods

510
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:34,420
with these giant houses with, you know, and Kyle, you were driving a Volkswagen Golf diesel

511
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:35,420
at the time.

512
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,420
You could barely fit in.

513
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:40,380
I was driving a Honda Civic or a Prius and like we're buzzing around neighborhoods, like,

514
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,860
you know, asking bold questions like this.

515
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:43,860
It was scary.

516
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:47,980
I remember when the guy said it, I was like, now I had all the objections in the world

517
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:48,980
in my head.

518
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:49,980
I'm like, now he's crazy.

519
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:53,260
I was like, in my head, I was like, well, what if the customer thinks it's high pressure?

520
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,980
You know, what if they think I'm a sleazy salesman?

521
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:57,780
What if the customer just says no and I lose the deal?

522
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:00,100
What if the customer kicks me out of the house?

523
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,380
And what if, what if, what if, what if, right?

524
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:04,300
These are all the things that you think.

525
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:09,420
And I remember he's like, if you will make up your mind and just follow this advice,

526
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:12,300
I promise you, you're going to close way more deals than you're going to lose.

527
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,220
And by the way, you are going to lose some deals.

528
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:16,820
I'm going to tell you guys right now, you are going to lose some deals doing this.

529
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,020
But guess what?

530
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,940
You're going to lose deals anyway.

531
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:20,940
You're going to lose deals.

532
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,060
This is sales, man.

533
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,060
You're going to lose deals.

534
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:26,020
So guys, this advice literally changed my life.

535
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:28,580
Like straight up literally changed my life.

536
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:34,220
And from that day, I can remember from that very day, I made the decision, the decision,

537
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:37,580
the decision, and I, it wasn't perfect at first.

538
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:41,860
It took me a minute to start implementing, but I was like, I have to change something

539
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,500
because I'm not, I'm not consistent.

540
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,540
I'm not closing deals and therefore I'm not making money.

541
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:49,980
And so I made the decision that I was going to do everything that I could that whenever

542
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:55,980
I got in a house at a closing table, the equivalent would be on a zoom call in the middle of a

543
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:56,980
negotiation.

544
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:57,980
It is a yes or no.

545
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:58,980
There is no maybe.

546
00:26:58,980 --> 00:26:59,980
Okay.

547
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:03,100
If the prospect tells, says, Hey, you know, I'm going to have to think about it.

548
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,380
I'm going to get back to you.

549
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:06,100
That is a no for me.

550
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,100
Okay.

551
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:10,700
So, um, so guys, what I want to do today in the training, and I'm going to leave some

552
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:15,540
time for Q and A at the end, but in the training, I want to convince you as best as I can.

553
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:16,780
And yes, I do want to convince you.

554
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:20,380
I'm not going to leave it up to you to, to, to think for yourself.

555
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:25,660
You don't have to do this, but you're talking to two people that have closed a lot of deals

556
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:30,340
and we've been, we've, dude, Kyle, we have heard every excuse in the book.

557
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:35,980
Well, and I was, I was going to say the alternative, if you don't do it and the downside, if you

558
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:42,980
don't do it is you have this like mentality the next day that you're like, Oh, they told

559
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:47,940
me to come back about six o'clock and so you don't work as hard because you're like, you're

560
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:48,940
banking on that.

561
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,340
You're like, Oh, they're going to give me a note.

562
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:52,660
Then six o'clock rolls around, lights are off.

563
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:56,700
You see him peeking through the, you know, the thing and that's the same with this.

564
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:00,700
If you're telling the business owner, like, okay, they're going to think about it.

565
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:04,700
You're not going to go find another business owner in the meantime, but if you get a no

566
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:07,700
the next day, you're like, okay, I got to go find someone you're actually working where

567
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,380
you know the answer already.

568
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:12,860
So that's the problem is it gives you this false sense of hope, which then sets you back

569
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:13,860
further.

570
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:14,860
It's such a good point.

571
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:20,180
I can't tell you how many times I've gone home or let's say selling business owners.

572
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:26,180
I finished a day, got on two, two closing calls, didn't get it, but you know, the one

573
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,620
was like a nine out of 10.

574
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:31,540
They just had to check the books, they had to just check the finances and the other one,

575
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:34,300
he just had to check with his partner really quick.

576
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:38,300
And in my head, I'm like, I'm not going to say anything, but I should have two deals

577
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,300
by 12, 12 in the morning.

578
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,940
And then, you know, I'll hit the gym and really feel good about myself.

579
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:47,020
You wake up, first one's a text message that says, hey, we're not going to do it.

580
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:51,500
Second one says, we're going to hold off till the first of next year or we decided not to

581
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,500
go forward.

582
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:57,260
And now, like Kyle said, you didn't plan for the day properly.

583
00:28:57,260 --> 00:29:01,340
You didn't have your mindset of like, hey, I got to go scrape, I got to go start over.

584
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,940
I got to go hook a new business owner.

585
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,660
You're sitting there going, I'm probably going to get it.

586
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,860
And it completely, it's a domino effect.

587
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:11,060
And I'm telling you guys, if you get off the call with somebody and they don't do the deal,

588
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:14,540
just go ahead and assume that it's a done deal, you're not going to get it.

589
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:19,220
Just assume that it's not going to happen because 90% of the time, you're not going

590
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,220
to get it.

591
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,220
Okay?

592
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:25,860
So, my goal in the next 15 minutes is I want to convince you guys that if you'll make up

593
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:31,220
your mind today that it is either a yes or a no, and then you will be strategic in how

594
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:34,220
you bring it up, because there is a way to do it right, there is a way to do it wrong.

595
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,220
I've done both, okay?

596
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:37,380
And I'm going to tell you what not to do.

597
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:42,140
If you'll do this, make up your mind, and just take a yes or no, you are going to close

598
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:44,780
way more deals than you're going to lose, okay?

599
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:48,260
And again, you are going to lose some because it's sales, okay?

600
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:50,140
So let's just go through this really quick.

601
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:52,420
I have five things I want to cover, is this.

602
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:57,820
So for this to be as effective as possible, guys, you have to set this up correctly or

603
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:03,260
you're just going to look like a slimy car salesman, which I admittedly have done before

604
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:07,060
because I haven't done this properly and you go in and you just, you don't, it doesn't

605
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,820
come across right, okay?

606
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:13,900
So number one, guys, you have to set the deal up correctly and you have to leave hints that

607
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:17,900
make sense why you're asking for the answer today, okay?

608
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:21,820
So I'm going to give you an example in door to door, I'll give you an example in this

609
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:25,020
business and then maybe if Kyle can think of one in door to door, I'll let him do it.

610
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:28,540
If not, I'll, I have one, okay?

611
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:35,340
In this business, one of the things I like to do is I like to plant the idea up front

612
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:38,940
to let people know, hey, I'm shopping this around.

613
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:43,660
I'm sending you leads, Mr. Business Owner, but, and I stole this from Jason Allred recently.

614
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:47,020
I love this one liner he uses, he says, hey, I'm sending you a couple leads, but I just

615
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:50,420
want you to know just to be completely upfront with you, I'm not exclusive with just you

616
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,060
yet.

617
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:54,380
I'm looking for the right partner in this area.

618
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:57,940
I'm not exclusive with you yet, okay?

619
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:01,460
So you know, letting them know you're working with other people and I'll throw stuff in

620
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:06,660
on my screencast, you know, hey, like I said, my goal is to work with the person that's

621
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:13,540
ready to move, the person that's hungry, and if that ends up being you, first, I want to

622
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,540
work with you.

623
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:19,860
I want you to, I do want to work with you, but if you're a maybe or I'm not sure, then

624
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:20,860
I got to move on.

625
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:24,260
I got ads running, if you want to say that, I've got leads coming in that are going to

626
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:28,820
waste, but you know, if you bring that up, it makes sense when you get to the end and

627
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:34,900
you say, hey, like, it's a yes or no for me, I got to have an answer.

628
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:39,860
Kyle, you just, yesterday, by the way, yesterday, me and Kyle, one of the things, as I said

629
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:43,420
in the beginning of this call, we're going back to the basics.

630
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:46,300
We're going back to the things that got us to success in the first place.

631
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:52,420
So yesterday, Kyle and I went over the sales call that he got on the sales call and we

632
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:54,180
didn't close it.

633
00:31:54,180 --> 00:32:00,740
And Kyle, you had a really, really good one-liner that completely eliminated the objection of

634
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:01,740
I want to think about it.

635
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:02,740
You want to share that, dude?

636
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:03,740
It was so money.

637
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:04,740
It was clutch.

638
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,740
I love that.

639
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:09,540
Oh, I think, was it the hard pressure one?

640
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,540
Yeah.

641
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,540
Yeah.

642
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:15,540
So I just said, hey, this isn't going to be like a hard pressure, like door to door close.

643
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:19,300
Like this is really just to make sure you're going to be a good fit.

644
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:25,060
But with that being said, I am going to ask for a yes or no at the end.

645
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:27,340
And the guy was like, that sounds fair.

646
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:31,260
And you got a yes or no, it was a no, but at least you're not sitting there wondering

647
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:34,180
if it's a maybe, right?

648
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:37,860
And so, and we went through the pitch, we're going through it again today, but we realized

649
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,700
like that wasn't where he lost the deal.

650
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:42,620
We lost the deal at a different point that we didn't hit on.

651
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:45,460
But needless to say, we didn't, at least we got an answer.

652
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:48,920
And that to me, closure is the best thing in sales, okay?

653
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,960
One of the things we would do in door to door sales is we would let the customer know throughout

654
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,960
the pitch.

655
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,760
Yeah, so we're actually in the neighborhood.

656
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,920
We're here for the summer, but we're here in this specific part of town.

657
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,700
And so what we're doing is we're doing like this group thing where we're going to allow

658
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:04,460
the technician to come in and install these all at once.

659
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:07,960
So we don't have to be, you know, driving back and forth, whatever, something that makes

660
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,600
sense where it's like the technician's already in the area.

661
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:14,800
For those of you that have done sales, it doesn't, you're like, yeah, you can see that

662
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,280
from a mile away that that's complete BS.

663
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:21,880
But we at least came up with something that sounded like a good reason to say, hey, it's

664
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,880
now or never, okay?

665
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,200
So you got to have a reason.

666
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:30,400
And to bring it up at the last second, it doesn't work as well.

667
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:35,080
If you bring it up before and you're like, hey, I'm already working with, I'm looking

668
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:39,000
at this other guy, I'm going to give you the first chance here because I like you.

669
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,480
But I do want you to know upfront, I want to be completely transparent with you.

670
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:44,120
I am also talking to another one of your competitors.

671
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:47,060
I don't feel comfortable sharing the name or I don't care.

672
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:49,980
You guys can share the name if you want, but I am talking to one of your competitors.

673
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,960
I would love to work with you, right?

674
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:55,180
So then you get to the end of the call and you can say, hey, I already told you I'm talking

675
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:56,180
to somebody else.

676
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,180
If you don't want to do it, no problem.

677
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:58,180
But I'm not taking a maybe.

678
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,820
I'm talking to him today, right?

679
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:00,820
It's got to make sense.

680
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:02,500
So number one, guys, you have to set the deal up correctly.

681
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:06,680
You have to give a reason that when you ask for a yes or no, it makes sense.

682
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:09,620
You don't sound like a freaking knob, okay?

683
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:12,180
Secondly, guys, you need to be agreeable.

684
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:13,860
This is something Kyle's really good at.

685
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:18,340
So Kyle, like when people are like, hey, I want to think about it.

686
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:22,780
I need to talk to freaking my goldfish.

687
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:23,780
You're always really good at this.

688
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:27,340
What do you say right out the gate before you just go into a freaking objection overcoming

689
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,340
mode?

690
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:31,740
Yeah, I usually just say like, I agree with them.

691
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:32,900
Yeah, I get it.

692
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,660
Like it's a decision you got to make.

693
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:42,180
And then just ask like, typically, it usually is price with anybody, right?

694
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:44,180
Typically, it's the price.

695
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:47,100
So it's like, hey, aside from price, like what else do you like?

696
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,420
What are you wanting to think about exactly?

697
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,420
Yeah, 100%.

698
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:52,420
And I would even add on that.

699
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:53,620
So that's a really good guy.

700
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:54,620
Make sure you agree.

701
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,300
Hey, I feel you, man.

702
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,820
I take the pressure off.

703
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,540
I completely understand what you're saying.

704
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:00,540
I feel you.

705
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:04,900
And then the next thing, guys, step number three, you have to, like Kyle just said, he

706
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:05,940
jumped ahead.

707
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:08,460
You have to tie them down to the objection.

708
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:12,500
So you need to figure out what it is they actually need to think about.

709
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,300
So I think it can change.

710
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,900
I think price can come up.

711
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:18,100
It depends on what you're selling.

712
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:23,620
But I honestly think when selling business owners, I don't get with business owners specifically,

713
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:27,460
I don't get price as much because I've already gone through the screencast.

714
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:29,700
I've already showed them the lead value calculator.

715
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:33,300
And it is an investment that they're making that they're going to make their money back.

716
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,300
But you have to tie it down.

717
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:40,220
For example, if Kyle was my prospect, I'd say, Kyle, so just really quick, if you don't

718
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:42,540
mind me asking, I just want to get on the same page as you.

719
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:45,300
What exactly is it that you want to think about?

720
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:52,140
Yeah, I mean, I just kind of have this principle that I don't make same day decisions.

721
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:56,860
It's kind of been the thing that's got me to where I'm at in business.

722
00:35:56,860 --> 00:36:01,700
I want to punch you in the face, Kyle.

723
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,300
That one is the worst.

724
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:07,820
And it's like, how do you argue with somebody that don't base principles?

725
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:10,860
OK, so let me ask this.

726
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:17,580
I'm assuming, Frank, I'll say Kyle, I'm assuming, Kyle, because of that, you got burned at some

727
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:18,580
point in the past.

728
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:19,580
And that's the reason why.

729
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:22,500
Like, is there something that I'm trying to dig a little bit.

730
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,500
So when did you get burned?

731
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:26,780
And he's going to tell me, well, I bought this car, blah, blah, blah.

732
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:29,740
So I'm going to say, so what do you think?

733
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:33,940
Like, obviously, if you were 100% certain about this and you knew that you were going

734
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:37,180
to get your money back, you were going to grow from this, it was going to be a good

735
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:40,140
partnership, you weren't worried I was going to scam you, this would be 100%.

736
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:41,140
Yes, there would be no doubt.

737
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:46,420
So I guess I'm just trying to figure out there's got to be a question.

738
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:48,940
I usually don't say there's got to be an objection.

739
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:51,740
You know, I don't like to put that in their head that they have an objection.

740
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:54,380
But what's your question, man?

741
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:59,900
Not to cut you off, but Kyle, you're already paying for Google Ads or you're already paying

742
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:01,500
for Home Advisor.

743
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,420
You already told me you're sick of them.

744
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:05,340
You already told me you want to grow this year.

745
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:08,860
I've already sent you five leads.

746
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:12,380
One of them you already closed, or if they haven't closed, don't say that.

747
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:14,260
You already know everything about me.

748
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:19,740
I've shown you what I've done for my, you know, whatever in the next town over.

749
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:23,940
So I understand what, and again, I'm saying this because I told you I'm already talking

750
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:24,940
to somebody else.

751
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,260
I'd like to see if we can make this work.

752
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:28,940
What is it that you want to think about?

753
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:30,700
And guys, you got to figure out what it is.

754
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:35,540
And if you push hard enough or you're strategic enough about like digging, you will get the

755
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:36,540
answer.

756
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:42,500
Well, you know, I just got to check because, well, like, yeah, I told you that we're making

757
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,220
30 grand a month.

758
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:47,340
However, we just had the engine in our car go out.

759
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:52,340
And guys, what you got to realize, especially with men, Kyle, tell me if I'm wrong, but

760
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:55,220
especially with men, we're so prideful.

761
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:59,020
We do not want to for one second tell them, like, I can't afford it.

762
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,020
Right.

763
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:02,780
Like, who wants to say, yeah, dude, money's tight.

764
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:05,620
I know I told you I was killing it.

765
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:09,980
I know my Instagram says I'm killing it, but I actually don't have 10 grand.

766
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:12,380
I actually don't have a thousand bucks a month.

767
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:13,380
Right.

768
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:18,460
And the reality is they're sitting there going, I don't have $500 to run on my credit card.

769
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:19,460
Right.

770
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:21,620
So you have to figure out what it is.

771
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:24,800
If you don't figure out what it is, guys, you're never going to get the deal.

772
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:29,500
So let's assume, Kyle, I've gotten past your stupid principle, which is just a smokescreen

773
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,500
anyway.

774
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:34,620
And you told me it's, let's just say it's something else because you don't get priced

775
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:36,100
as much when you're doing business.

776
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:42,900
Let's say that you told me, I don't know, what's another one we get all the time.

777
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:47,620
Let's say you got burned in the past or whatever.

778
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:51,220
You want to make sure that you want to talk to one of my clients.

779
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:52,220
Something like that.

780
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:53,220
Right.

781
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:56,100
So you got to tie the next thing, guys, you figure out what it is and you got to tie them

782
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,720
down to that objection.

783
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:02,500
So Kyle, besides wanting to make sure I'm legit, make sure that I'm not like these leads

784
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,500
that I sent you.

785
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:07,060
I didn't go and like, I don't know, I don't even know where I'd pull them from, but let's

786
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:11,340
say they're not a couple of my buddies from around town that are fake estimates that you

787
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,340
closed one of them.

788
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:13,340
Right.

789
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:15,220
I'm going to make it seem ridiculous.

790
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:17,900
Besides the fact you want to make sure I'm not a complete scam.

791
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:20,160
I'm not the Tinder swindler.

792
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,620
Is there anything else that doesn't make sense about this that would stop you from moving

793
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:24,620
forward today?

794
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:31,200
And then he'll say, yeah, no, if he says, yes, you need to figure out what it is.

795
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,380
Well, I also this, right.

796
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:38,400
And you got, and then once you say that, if they say, no, that's it, say, okay, now guys,

797
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,880
we've tied them, we've pushed them into a corner.

798
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,120
We've tied them into a corner.

799
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,880
We call it a tie down, right?

800
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:44,880
It's the same thing.

801
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:45,880
You can use the other analogy.

802
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,060
You're in a house in order to close the deal.

803
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:49,440
You need to completely seal.

804
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,440
You're in a room.

805
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,440
You need to completely seal it.

806
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,440
You have the door.

807
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,440
You have the windows.

808
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,440
You get three, four windows.

809
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:57,120
And each one of these objections, you need to close all of the windows and doors and

810
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,280
figure out where the leak is.

811
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,080
And if it's that one window that's price, that's it, but you got to make sure everything

812
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,080
else is closed.

813
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:08,600
Otherwise, as soon as you close the price window, then the freaking, I got to talk to

814
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:13,760
my goldfish over here or my wife because she's going to get mad at me.

815
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,760
That window opens, right?

816
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:17,000
You have to tie them down to one objection.

817
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Okay.

818
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:22,040
Guys, and I was going to say one other thing.

819
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:28,160
I think it also comes back to like making sure you're qualifying people correctly.

820
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:32,480
Just because when you said that with the price, it just, you know, business owners, I've had

821
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:37,000
calls before where I've like, I've been so desperate just to pass off the leads to anybody

822
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,260
because I didn't want him to go to waste that I didn't qualify the business owners correctly.

823
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:46,920
So then when I got on the zoom call, I'm actually like, dude, this guy is like working out of

824
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:50,560
It's like him working out of his, you know, garage and like, he doesn't actually have

825
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,560
a legit company.

826
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:55,040
And so it's like, when I hit him with price, he's like, well, I could give you 250.

827
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:59,800
It's like, oh, I would have saved myself so much time if I actually would have qualified

828
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,440
him when I was getting him on the hook.

829
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,000
And that's part of the setup, you know.

830
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
That's a really good point.

831
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,560
That's, that kind of, that should, that's even before all of this, that's, we're assuming

832
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:13,440
with what we're talking about today that you've qualified correctly, but if you guys remembered

833
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:19,440
from my training, usually when you when you're losing the deal, it's usually the step or

834
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,440
two before.

835
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:24,600
OK, so if you're getting to the end of the call and you're getting this time and time

836
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,920
again, hey, I literally don't have money.

837
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,160
Like I'll show you my bank account and guys, I don't know about you, but I've had people

838
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,440
literally show me their bank account.

839
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,360
They're like, dude, no shame.

840
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,760
There's like seven dollars in there.

841
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,800
I've actually had that happen.

842
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,960
That's a qualification issue.

843
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:42,360
And no matter any of this stuff you do, you're not going to get around it.

844
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,240
Let's assume you qualify them correctly.

845
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,960
That's a really good point, Kyle.

846
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:49,760
Once you so just to review, you're going to make sure that you you you make it make sense.

847
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,920
You have something kind of jammed in there that's like, OK, it makes sense.

848
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,720
They ask for the deal.

849
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,860
Number two, you're agreeable.

850
00:41:56,860 --> 00:42:02,040
Number three, you figure out exactly what the objection is and you tie them down.

851
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:09,400
Then what I like to do and Kyle's really good at this as well is you want to use the neighbors.

852
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:12,600
You want to use your other customers to close.

853
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:20,240
OK, it's way better when we say, hey, you remember Fred that I told you about that he

854
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,800
felt the exact same way that you feel.

855
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:27,720
And he's what he ended up thinking and realizing was this.

856
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:32,920
That sounds so much better than me coming at you and going, dude, you're stupid.

857
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,760
Why don't you understand this?

858
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:39,960
They can relate to Fred, who's another business owner that's a client of mine, way more than

859
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:40,960
they can relate to you.

860
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:45,560
And again, yesterday, Kyle and I are watching the sales call and he's done this so long,

861
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,280
he weaves in.

862
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,480
Anytime he has an opportunity, he was like, hey, have you heard of this person?

863
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,960
Let me tell you a little bit about them.

864
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:56,200
So now he's like, by the time the close comes, he's talked about three or four other people

865
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,040
who are already making money.

866
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:01,280
And he can come back and be like, hey, you remember that person I told you at the beginning?

867
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,320
Let me tell you about them.

868
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:06,760
When I went to close them, they were not ready to go at all.

869
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:09,400
They were the same thing as you.

870
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:11,880
They have a principle of 24 hours, whatever.

871
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:16,080
So guys, you want to sell through the neighbors, you want to sell to the business owners, and

872
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:22,920
you want to use them and use their story to explain how they, despite having doubts, were

873
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,320
able to make this decision.

874
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,840
Now, there's a method for this.

875
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:26,840
It's called feel, felt, found.

876
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:29,040
We don't have time to go into depth on that.

877
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,960
It's a completely separate training.

878
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:35,080
But I think inside of the, I'm almost positive, inside of the premium training library, premium

879
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:38,840
sales training library, for any of you that are paid in full, message Ashley.

880
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:41,680
If you're paid in full, you'll have access to the premium sales training library.

881
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:45,440
I think we have a video, maybe even a few, on the feel, felt, found method.

882
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,520
I'm almost 100% positive.

883
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,640
But you're going to sell through the customer, okay?

884
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:51,640
Example is this.

885
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:54,640
You know, hey, you remember that guy I told you about, Brooks?

886
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,880
The one I've been working with since 2020?

887
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,400
Funny enough, when he started, it was the exact same thing.

888
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:02,480
He was actually paying Home Advisor only like 300 bucks.

889
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:06,580
And for him, he was like having a hard time wrapping his head around tripling the price.

890
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:10,160
But then when he, what he said to me once we started talking about is he actually realized

891
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:14,160
that even though he was only paying 300 bucks a month, he was literally competing for every

892
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,260
one of these leads.

893
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:18,300
He was sharing these leads with three, four, five people.

894
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:22,440
So for every one of those leads, Home Advisor was actually charging triple.

895
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:27,280
So it was like, those leads were worth a thousand bucks a month, but he was only paying 300.

896
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,720
And that's why he wasn't closing any.

897
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:32,320
So for him, he's like, if I can close one deal from these exclusive leads, it makes

898
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:33,320
sense.

899
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:34,880
And that's why he decided to move forward.

900
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,760
Whatever it is, I would try to be more succinct than that.

901
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:38,800
I'm just coming up with something on the spot.

902
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:44,000
But use other people, other business owners, other deals that you've done, or other deals

903
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,960
that people have done inside of this group, if you don't have any deals yet, to go ahead

904
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:51,960
and overcome that objection that they have.

905
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:55,540
And then from there, guys, you can go back for the close, okay?

906
00:44:55,540 --> 00:45:02,420
And so, guys, I'm telling you, if you will do this, and I'm going to end with one last

907
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:08,460
thing where you need to go for the close again, but if you guys will just make up your mind

908
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:13,540
to do a yes or no on every single call, you are going to close way more deals.

909
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:16,100
What it is, guys, think about it like this, you get to the end of the call, you have a

910
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:18,060
business owner that's sitting on the fence, right?

911
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:20,420
They could go yes, they could go no.

912
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:24,420
And I'm telling you, if you walk away from the deal, leaving them sitting on the fence,

913
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:27,780
the majority of them are going to tip on the side of no.

914
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:31,580
If you will be bold, if you will ask for an answer, if you will ask for a yes or no on

915
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:37,980
the call, you are going to tip a percentage of them that are leaning your way, you're

916
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:40,020
going to tip them on your side.

917
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:42,220
That nudge is going to get them on your side.

918
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:50,420
Kyle, we had a call, I was in Africa, what was this, two, three weeks ago, Kyle was on

919
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:51,420
a call.

920
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:58,300
We had an individual that was super interested and their objection was, were they about

921
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:00,700
to start school or something, you remember this?

922
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:04,500
I'm drawing a blank on who that was.

923
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:07,140
This person was about to start school, they were super interested and everything made

924
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:08,380
sense, blah, blah, blah.

925
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:13,820
I hopped on the call and basically reiterated what Kyle said, I'm like, hey, the reality

926
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:18,100
is because this person was like, I want to get to the new place, I want to get settled

927
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:19,900
and I'm going to have a better idea of my time.

928
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:27,100
I basically said to him, we tied him down and I said something to the extent of, here's

929
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:31,100
the reality, man, if we hang up this call, you already know the decision, whether you

930
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:35,260
get down there today, tomorrow, whatever, if you want to make this work, you're going

931
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:36,260
to make it work.

932
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:39,900
I don't know what your situation is going to look like, but I can tell you that if you

933
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:42,620
want to make this work, you are going to make it work because I've seen tons of other people

934
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:43,620
do it.

935
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:45,140
So let's do this.

936
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:49,260
I think what we ended up saying, we didn't even ask, we're like, I'm going to take a

937
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:54,500
thousand bucks down, the rest is going to be next week on this day and we're going to

938
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:55,500
get you going today.

939
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:57,820
And do you remember the guys like, okay, I think we can do that.

940
00:46:57,820 --> 00:47:00,860
Do you remember what I'm talking about now?

941
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:01,860
Probably not because you do so many calls.

942
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:06,820
But anyway, I remember that call and all it took was like, hey, we're not doing that.

943
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:11,500
And if it's a no, if it's a I want to think about it, you're not our guy.

944
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:16,980
I want business owners that are like, and guys, it's true, man, business owners that

945
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:20,980
can make a fricking decision are business owners you want to work with, right?

946
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:26,140
If they're hum-hum around with you, they're not going to be closing fricking people that

947
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:28,260
want, that want their concrete services.

948
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:32,700
They're going to believe their stupid objections to a good salesperson is also somebody that's

949
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:35,540
confident in making a decision, okay?

950
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:38,620
The better I've gotten at sales, the easier it is for me to go and buy something on the

951
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:39,620
spot.

952
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:42,740
The easier it is for me to make a decision on, on whatever it is, whether it's a $20,000

953
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:49,500
program, whether it's buying a $220,000 G-Wagon off the lot without talking to my spouse.

954
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:53,420
I don't care because I'm like, I'm confident in making that decision because I know I can

955
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:57,620
go and make the money back or I can take the knowledge and make the money from that thing.

956
00:47:57,620 --> 00:48:03,340
Okay, so just to review, you to make this effective, you have to put something in there

957
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:04,900
that makes sense, okay?

958
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:06,500
We're talking to other business owners.

959
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:08,380
Step number two, you have to be agreeable.

960
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:10,420
Step number three, you got to figure out what the objection is.

961
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:12,420
You got to tie them down, okay?

962
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:14,100
Step number four, you're going to use the neighbors.

963
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:17,340
You're going to use the neighbors meaning the customers, your other customers that you've

964
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:18,500
sold before.

965
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:21,740
And step number five, guys, is you're going to go back for the close, okay?

966
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:27,260
And you're going to say something like, so Brooks, like, or Bob, Kyle, like I told you,

967
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:29,460
you're in the exact same situation as him.

968
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:30,460
Nothing's going to change.

969
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:32,500
If I get off this call, the only thing that's going to change is I'm going to be going and

970
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:35,680
working with your competitor, which I don't want to see happen.

971
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,160
Everything makes sense.

972
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:38,500
You told me you want to grow.

973
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:42,240
You told me that you close at this percentage with this profit margin in this.

974
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:44,220
We did the numbers in the lead value calculator.

975
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:45,720
Price is not an issue.

976
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:48,400
There's nothing that's going to change from now to tomorrow.

977
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,400
Let's do this deal, man.

978
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:51,000
What, you want to put the Amex or Visa on file?

979
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Let's do this, right?

980
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,880
And it doesn't have to be that bold.

981
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:54,880
You could say something else.

982
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:58,360
Kyle, how do you go back for the close after you've tried to do it and then you do it again?

983
00:48:58,360 --> 00:48:59,360
What's your go-to?

984
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:04,360
I don't know.

985
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:07,760
It usually actually just kind of falls in place.

986
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:11,080
Like once you've kind of been like, well, you know, because even with the business owners,

987
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:14,320
you can be like, well, let's just do like a weekly deal, like a weekly payment.

988
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,320
Yeah.

989
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:20,160
So instead of like, yeah, fifteen hundred bucks a month, let's just do, you know, whatever

990
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:24,640
that is, two seventy five a week or three seventy five, whatever that comes out to.

991
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:30,480
And so almost a different like Amex or Visa, but like, OK, let's just do weekly versus

992
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:31,480
monthly.

993
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:35,880
But usually once you talk to them, usually they're just like, yeah, that makes sense.

994
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:36,880
Like let's just do it.

995
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:37,880
Yeah.

996
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:41,520
Kyle, you're using an assumption close just by doing it.

997
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:45,880
So Kyle, what he's saying, he's like, OK, so besides price, well, let's make this easy.

998
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:46,880
You said price.

999
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:48,480
And then when it comes to price, you want to dig in a little.

1000
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:51,720
Are you talking about the, you know, the whatever?

1001
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:53,600
I'm guessing the monthly chunk kind of scares you.

1002
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:54,600
Let's make it easy.

1003
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:55,600
I'll take this.

1004
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:56,600
I'll split it up into four payments.

1005
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:57,600
And then that's the way it's more digestible.

1006
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:58,600
Sound fair?

1007
00:49:58,600 --> 00:49:59,600
Boom.

1008
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:00,600
Done.

1009
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:01,600
You got it.

1010
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:02,600
That's the steps, guys.

1011
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:11,480
The last thing I want to say is if they still are sitting there hum, hon, whatever, I would

1012
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:15,360
say something to this extent, OK, this is something that I would use again and again

1013
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:16,360
and again.

1014
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:17,360
I would say something to the extent of this.

1015
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:18,360
Look, sir.

1016
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:21,680
Look, ma'am, I've been doing this a long time.

1017
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:25,760
You've already told me you're unhappy with HomeAdvisor or Google Ads.

1018
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:30,760
You told me you're interested in growing and you love the exclusivity of what I'm offering.

1019
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:36,600
You said you've seen what I've done for Joe, for Jack, for Brooks, whatever.

1020
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:39,240
And on top of that, I've sent you three leads for free.

1021
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:41,400
And no disrespect, Kyle.

1022
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:47,220
But if it doesn't make sense at this point and you're still like a maybe, I respectfully

1023
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:51,400
I want to retract my offer, I'm a no.

1024
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:53,980
Bold statements.

1025
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:57,000
And you just be quiet.

1026
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
And why do you do that, Kyle?

1027
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,800
Explain what the psychology is behind that.

1028
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:03,480
It basically just gets them thinking.

1029
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:08,280
It's kind of the first person who speaks loses kind of deal, but it just makes them actually

1030
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:12,680
make a decision instead of you jumping in and being like, oh, well, if you don't and

1031
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:14,000
then it gives them an out.

1032
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,640
So it basically takes the out away.

1033
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:20,040
So if you go through all those steps and they're still like, hey, I still got to think about

1034
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:22,560
it, then you got to go and you got to say what I just said.

1035
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:24,840
And what you're doing, guys, is you're taking the control back.

1036
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:29,360
You're like, OK, well, you know, if you're going to break up with me, by golly, I'm going

1037
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:31,000
to be the first one to break up with you.

1038
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,000
And you're like, you know what?

1039
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,160
If you're a maybe, you're not my guy.

1040
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:37,520
And the reason, guys, if you do that, what you're doing is you're taking the control

1041
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:38,520
back.

1042
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:43,440
But also, if they are actually this is the psychology.

1043
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:49,680
If they were going to do it tonight or tomorrow or in three days, if you take the deal away,

1044
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:54,560
if they were actually going to do it, if you retract the deal, I promise you they're going

1045
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:57,000
to come with you.

1046
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,000
And guess what?

1047
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,240
The people that were never going to do it, you know what they're going to do?

1048
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,240
That's the perfect out.

1049
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:05,560
They're going to say, well, I guess I guess that's fair.

1050
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:06,560
I had this happen yesterday.

1051
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:12,160
We had a business owner, me and Francesca did this this proposal and they were hum-hum.

1052
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:15,600
It was the sister that kiboshed the deal, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1053
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,320
And finally, we were like, what should we do?

1054
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:18,320
Should we try to hit him with something?

1055
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:19,320
Get back on the phone.

1056
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:20,320
I said, you know what?

1057
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:24,080
Let's just see where they're actually at, because I was like, I don't think it's going

1058
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:25,080
to work anywhere.

1059
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:26,080
So you know what I did?

1060
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:27,080
I did exactly that.

1061
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:32,720
I did it over a text because it was just the situation and I sent him a text.

1062
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:33,720
I said, hey, whatever.

1063
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:35,280
I think his name was Brandon.

1064
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:39,000
I said, Brandon, no offense, but we've been going back and forth.

1065
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,640
It's like our third time doing this.

1066
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:44,520
I feel like you're on board, but your sister, every time we talk to her, she just kills

1067
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:45,520
the deal.

1068
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:48,600
I said, respectfully, we're going to retract our offer.

1069
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:49,920
And you know what he said?

1070
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,280
He didn't say, okay, let's do it.

1071
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:53,080
He said, I think that sounds fair.

1072
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:54,240
Sorry, it couldn't work out.

1073
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:55,720
The dude was never going to do it.

1074
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:58,280
Imagine if we had been sitting there thinking, oh, this guy's going to call us and think

1075
00:52:58,280 --> 00:52:59,280
about it.

1076
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:00,280
They're not going to do that, guys.

1077
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:05,320
So if you get to the end, you go through the steps and they still are a maybe, you need

1078
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:06,320
to withdraw.

1079
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:07,320
You need to retract the offer.

1080
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:11,440
I'm going to say that one more time, ma'am, sir, Kyle, look, I've been doing this a long

1081
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:12,440
time.

1082
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:13,440
Okay.

1083
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,360
I've already, you've already told me you're unhappy with home advisor or whoever.

1084
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:17,960
You told me you're interested in growing.

1085
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:20,360
You told me you love the exclusivity of what I'm doing.

1086
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:21,680
You've seen what I can do.

1087
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:23,040
You've seen it with these other people.

1088
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:27,600
I've shown you other projects I've done, and I've already sent you three leads for absolutely

1089
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:28,600
free.

1090
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:29,600
Have you had anyone else do that for you?

1091
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:30,760
I don't think so.

1092
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:34,840
At this point, if it still doesn't make sense, if you're still a maybe, I just don't think

1093
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:36,120
this is going to be a good fit.

1094
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:39,120
I want somebody that's confident in making a decision and wants to work.

1095
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:42,640
You've told me everything that you're ready to go, but now you're hesitating.

1096
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:48,880
Respectfully, if you can't say yes now, I think I'm going to have to go look elsewhere.

1097
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:51,340
And it's scary the first time you say it.

1098
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:56,140
But if they are on the fence leaning your direction, you're going to tip 90% of them.

1099
00:53:56,140 --> 00:54:00,900
And if you lose the deal right there, you are never going to get them anyway.

1100
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:06,540
But what you've done is you've saved yourself an entire 24 hours, 48 hours, maybe a week

1101
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:09,220
time thinking you're going to get a deal that you're not going to get.

1102
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:12,660
You can wake up, you can get off the call, get pissed off for a second, go hook another

1103
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:14,380
business owner and write that person off.

1104
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:15,660
And I'm not saying to end it on a bad note.

1105
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:17,100
I'm saying burn a bridge.

1106
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:20,060
I'm saying retract the offer and move on.

1107
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:22,380
Kyle, anything else I missed?

1108
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:25,900
Well, one thing I was thinking about as you were talking that you do really well that

1109
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:32,460
I don't do as well is calling people out on things that they've said.

1110
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:37,540
So like with digital landlords, of course, we have it like, hey, can you make a decision

1111
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:39,100
in the application?

1112
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:40,900
And then we say that on the call.

1113
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:43,580
And then when we get to the end, they're like, well, I got to make it, you know, I got to

1114
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:44,580
think about it.

1115
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:47,180
And I don't do as well as just calling them out on their bullshit and you do a really

1116
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:48,180
good job.

1117
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:51,460
Same thing with the business owners, like sometimes it's uncomfortable to call them

1118
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:54,060
out when at the beginning, they're like, yeah, I'm hungry.

1119
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:55,820
I'm looking to grow all this.

1120
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:58,780
And then they get to the end, they're like, well, kind of hum-hulling.

1121
00:54:58,780 --> 00:55:02,300
Like that's when you can come back and be like, well, earlier you said you were hungry

1122
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:03,300
to grow.

1123
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:05,780
Like, were you just saying that just because it sounded cool or what?

1124
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:08,020
That's something that it takes a little bit.

1125
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:10,420
You're a lot more bold on that kind of stuff than I am.

1126
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:13,740
But, you know, that's one thing tying them back to what they've said.

1127
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:16,700
Yeah, we were going through the call yesterday.

1128
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:23,900
And I think the person that we were, the call that we were reviewing early in the call,

1129
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:29,580
the person said something like, I don't want to waste a bunch of time trying this on my

1130
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:30,580
own.

1131
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:31,580
Right?

1132
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:33,820
I don't want to waste two years trying this on my own.

1133
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:36,460
We get to the end of the call, or Kyle gets to the end of the call, and the guy's like,

1134
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:39,660
he goes, well, I haven't really tried this on my own yet.

1135
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:45,020
And it's like, well, you numb nuts, you said you weren't going to, you said you didn't

1136
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:46,020
want to waste two years.

1137
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:47,660
So now you want to waste two years.

1138
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:48,660
Right?

1139
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:49,660
And I get it.

1140
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:50,660
It's uncomfortable.

1141
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:53,540
But I promise you guys, you're not here to make friends.

1142
00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:55,260
You're not here to make friends with your business owners.

1143
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:58,340
You can become friends, but you want them to respect you.

1144
00:55:58,340 --> 00:55:59,340
You're here to make them money.

1145
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:03,020
If you can make them money, you will become lifelong friends.

1146
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:04,020
Okay?

1147
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:08,020
But letting them roll over you, not holding them to what they said, that's not going,

1148
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:09,020
they're not going to respect you.

1149
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:10,740
They're just, they're bulldozing you.

1150
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:11,740
Okay?

1151
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:16,220
And I'm not a big fan of the Cardone, hard close, blah, blah, blah, but I'm telling

1152
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:18,940
you guys, this is how I want to end.

1153
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:23,580
If you'll make up your mind today that you are no longer taking a maybe, it's a yes or

1154
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:28,100
a no, I promise you, you will close more deals than you will lose.

1155
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:29,100
100%.

1156
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:30,100
Guys, there's a bunch of comments.

1157
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:31,100
I apologize.

1158
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:32,100
We couldn't get to them.

1159
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:33,100
We were just ripping.

1160
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:34,100
We're going.

1161
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:35,100
Kyle, let's close some deals this week.

1162
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,100
Guys, appreciate you being on.

1163
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:39,100
We'll be on next Tuesday live, and we'll see you guys then.

1164
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:39,660
Bye.
