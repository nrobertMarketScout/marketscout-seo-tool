1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,760
Okay guys welcome to the call Monday August 26th. Again we apologize for a

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:13,240
little bit of a delay. We got a little bit of a confusion with the link so

3
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,960
we'll make sure that doesn't happen next week but I want to let you guys know

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:21,480
first and foremost the only thing that we require on this call is that if what

5
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,360
what we do at the end of every one of these calls and this is your first one

6
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,080
is we're going to take all the information that we give you guys and we

7
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,040
are going to put it into a digital resource that looks pretty that's

8
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:37,000
condensed and then anybody that stays on this call with their camera on till the

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,180
end we're gonna take a screenshot and then we're gonna send you guys this

10
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:44,360
digital resource and the reason why is it because we're like power hungry it's

11
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,520
because we want to make sure that people are paying attention and they're sitting

12
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,880
there or you could be driving too but we want to make sure that you guys are

13
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:55,920
actually the ones that are are here for the right reason and so in the past

14
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:00,200
we've had people jump on these lives and all they're they're just here to consume

15
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:05,680
and take and take and take and so I've said this before but I would rather four

16
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,120
people be on this live I'd rather one person be on this live that really wants

17
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,040
to take action than have a hundred people that do not and so that's all

18
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,520
that we ask keep your camera on we understand you got to be moving maybe

19
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,720
you've got to be doing this or that or the rest that's fine at the end of this

20
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:23,960
live we will take a screenshot sent in send you that digital resource so then

21
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,120
you don't have to take sit here and take notes on everything that I give you

22
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:31,080
you can that'll come as a digital resource what I would rather you guys do

23
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:36,200
is take notes on the things that come to your mind so I'm gonna say things today

24
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,560
that are gonna give you ideas they're gonna remind you to reach out to this

25
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,960
person or oh that person has this business or I should do this those are

26
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,360
the things I want you to take notes on because all the information I'm gonna

27
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,160
share today I am going to be sending you as long as you just stay on this call

28
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:55,800
and keep your camera on but guys welcome again once again to the call my

29
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:04,120
goal for well let me just say this first I I I don't believe you guys should

30
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:09,240
listen or believe anything that I say and that's not like some catchy phrase

31
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:13,560
whatever but I truly anything that I share with you I want you to ask

32
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:19,200
yourself why should I listen to this guy and then I want you to go and test it I

33
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,400
don't ever want you just to take my word because if you take my word you're

34
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,080
gonna take the next guy and the next gal and and that's a scary place to be

35
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,600
because 99% of people are full of crap okay all right so um but for those that

36
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:36,000
don't know me I've been doing this eight years made in 2020 made my first

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,720
million dollars doing this and that's not from selling a coaching program

38
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,680
that's literally from building simple websites ranking them on Google and

39
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:47,440
renting them out and that's that my business was built brick by brick it was

40
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:53,560
$500 a month thousand dollar a month $500 a month $2,000 a month $2,500

41
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,800
thousand dollar all that first thousand dollar grew to five thousand and it was

42
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,680
literally just brick by brick by brick by brick and the difference between

43
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,200
barely scraping by and getting to a hundred thousand dollars a month in

44
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,600
July of 2020 and never looking back is that I figured out a few key things that

45
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,760
made all the difference in the world and some of you guys on this call have been

46
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,640
thinking about this business model or doing this business model for years or

47
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,400
months or weeks some of you guys have known about this business model for over

48
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,840
ten years and some of you guys have been in other programs and you just can't

49
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,560
have this you haven't had the success that you want and I feel your pain and

50
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:38,920
that's why I'm doing these calls okay so I so wish that when I was trying to

51
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:43,520
scale that I would have had somebody that had done what I wanted to do and

52
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,960
what I wanted to do was make a hundred thousand dollars in a month doing this

53
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:53,560
and nobody that I knew and to this day I still do not know anybody else besides

54
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,360
myself that has done a hundred thousand dollars per month doing this now I know

55
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,160
some people have messaged me oh this guy in this country and this guy in this

56
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:04,760
state but personally I do not know anybody else that has made a hundred

57
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:10,640
thousand dollars per month doing this business model and so for me this is what

58
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:16,840
I wish I had okay what I want to mention really quick before I forget is and I'm

59
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:22,680
gonna have either Aaron or Jason share this we actually decided to start a

60
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:28,800
podcast based based on and completely around digital real estate all things

61
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,840
it's it's very niche it's very nuanced it's very in the weeds it's complete

62
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,420
it's not just taking lives and putting it on a podcast these are separate

63
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:42,340
episodes these are separate topics this is taking my my time to do this but we

64
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:47,660
just launched a podcast on Spotify it's on Apple podcast as well so Aaron or

65
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:52,060

69
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:10,860
to find it digital real estate Nick would so let me go ahead and share this

70
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:18,100
really quick and I'll put it in the comments hold on in the chat I can post

ahead and grab the Apple one that's fine too but yeah there's the podcast again

73
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:31,420
these are these are episodes specifically for the podcast this first

74
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:35,940
one is is my story if you guys haven't heard my story already if you have you

75
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:39,580
guys can skip through part of it but it's a 34 minute episode it's my story

76
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:43,940
what is digital real estate and we actually have another episode already

77
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:47,100
filmed that we're gonna be dropping this week and it's gonna be a weekly show so

78
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:51,620
go ahead if you would like again no pressure you could subscribe to that and

79
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:55,420
check that out as well that's a nice format to listen to at the gym while

80
00:05:55,420 --> 00:06:01,620
you're driving whatever okay so my goal guys by the end of this call is that

81
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:06,620
you're gonna have multiple ways that you can use to generate literally

82
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:11,260
unlimited niche ideas okay niche ideas until you're blue in the face and it's

83
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:17,420
funny because I like how Aaron started he's like we're gonna answer the

84
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:22,660
question once and for all is is rank-and-ret saturated right and the I

85
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:26,700
also hope by the end of this call I don't even have to talk about that I

86
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:31,380
have made like three four videos on saturation because everyone's number one

87
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:34,700
question is is this model saturated and I promise you I'm probably gonna do a

88
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:39,180
podcast episode called the saturation of rank-and-ret because everyone it's like

89
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:42,380
once we get into something we always want to know am I too late to the game

90
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:45,980
and so I'm not gonna answer that question right now I'm gonna let you

91
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:49,460
guys answer that question but just based on what you're gonna hear from me today

92
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:53,060
you're gonna be able to answer that question okay there is so there's so

93
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:58,020
many ways there's so many niches out there it's extremely exciting a couple

94
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:04,220
guys weren't on I literally pulled this out of my desk and this is one of the

95
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,780
methods we're gonna talk about today but I pulled this out this little flyer out

96
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:11,500
of my desk that came to my mailbox like two years ago and I was like yeah and I

97
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,860
was like that's a really interesting niche and somebody on the call it was

98
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:18,500
one of my students I believe was like yeah I actually make money in this

99
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:24,220
niche it's I think the term would be like sheds or portable sheds and the

100
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:27,940
average ticket price is five thousand dollars and so that was literally just

101
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:32,340
like an example and I'm gonna I think Francesca's actually built out a site

102
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:37,900
for this already or we're doing the the the ads for right now but there are so

103
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:42,800
many niches out there guys it's insane so let's get into this guys also what I

104
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:49,220
would like you to do is if you have a specific niche in mind I would like you

105
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:56,020
drop it in the comments and I'm gonna try and save about 15 minutes to do Q&A

106
00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:00,900
and as part of that Q&A I want to be able to let you guys know my opinion on

107
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:05,820
certain niches and I'll tell you guys if I have personally done it or if it's

108
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:10,100
just my opinion because I have done a lot of niches but if I haven't I'll give

109
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:13,820
you my opinion on why I think it would be or wouldn't be a good niche okay okay

110
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:17,060
so guys here's the plan for today's call number one I'm gonna talk to you guys

111
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:20,300
about why you should stick to boring niches until your bills are paid number

112
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:27,260
two why I think you should let other people pay for you to test niches then

113
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:32,340
we're gonna talk about different methods I've got one two three four five six

114
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:39,060
seven eight nine I've got ten different methods and that there are so many more

115
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:44,060
than that but I'm just gonna give you ten ideas of places you can use to go

116
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:47,700
and find niches that's not ten niches that's ten different places you can

117
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:52,820
look for niche ideas so there should never be a shortage of ideas for

118
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:59,300
niches okay so starting off by the way Aaron Jason I'm gonna let you guys be my

119
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:04,220
eyes and ears if you guys see something that you think is relevant to what I'm

120
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:09,860
saying cut me off and just unmute yourself and just say hey Nick I want to

121
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:13,100
you know ask this question because it's pertinent to what you're saying right

122
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:17,260
now please let me know okay but if not guys start dropping your questions start

123
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:23,380
dropping your niches inside the comments and let's get going so number one guys

124
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:29,620
three weeks ago four weeks ago I talked about going vertical versus going broad

125
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:33,860
you know you know basically going into multiple different niches versus going

126
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:37,880
into one niche and how I've done both I started off by going into multiple

127
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:43,600
niches and then I honed into just one and then I told you guys at the end what

128
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,640
I would do if I was starting today which is neither it's a kind of a combination

129
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,040
of both and if you guys didn't get that training sometimes in the free group

130
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:56,200
we're giving away like you know the stack of trainings so keep an eye out

131
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:01,320
for that kind of stuff by the way hold on okay I thought that was somebody

132
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:06,240
unmuting one of my guys okay so um but guys what I mentioned that training the

133
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:14,160
reason I bring that up is I spent the first I would say well it was it was up

134
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:21,040
until 2019 I just was testing niches I was literally just testing niches I was

135
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,840
trying anything and everything if I if I talked to somebody I would write it down

136
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:31,560
and I was like let me try that niche and if I saw you know a business card at the

137
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:36,680
gym or an advertisement at the gym I would write it down and I would test it

138
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:43,600
and guys I I probably tried I don't even know man 20 20 to 30 different niches

139
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,080
maybe more and I was making eight to ten thousand dollars a month okay and it

140
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:53,520
wasn't until the beginning of 2020 when I just had this realization that I was so

141
00:10:53,520 --> 00:11:01,160
spread out I was so my attention was so spread thin that I needed to just focus

142
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:06,920
and my brain doesn't work like that I I thought you know well Elon Musk has three

143
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:12,440
companies he's got Solar City he's got Tesla he's got SpaceX I could have a

144
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,800
couple different companies and it's like no I'm not the same as Elon Musk I'm

145
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:21,160
freaking just as average as can be and I got to stick to one thing so unless

146
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:27,840
you're Elon Musk my advice to you is simplify get very very simple get very

147
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:32,880
focused on one thing and I've heard so many different people say this again and

148
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,440
again and again I've heard Alex Hermosy say this I've heard one of Alex Hermosy's

149
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,120
somebody that is a friend of Alex Hermosy that I know I just did this

150
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:47,120
podcast with this guy in Dubai this is a couple weeks ago and his name is Dan

151
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,680
Henry and this guy he's a 10 million plus type of a guy he's he's a smart

152
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:57,320
dude he's he's kind of in this space to some extent not in rank and rep but he's

153
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:03,040
in online marketing and he same thing happened to him he he started off he was

154
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,840
crushing it and doing one thing he was selling one thing and he said he scaled

155
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:11,840
up to two hundred and fifty thousand dollars per month and then what he did

156
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:15,840
is he in his head he's like well I'm gonna go add another offer and another

157
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:21,160
offer and at one point he had 13 different products that he was selling 13

158
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:25,320
he went from one to 13 and his revenue went from two hundred and fifty

159
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,760
thousand dollars per month to seventy thousand dollars per month and I guess

160
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,400
he joined this guy named Sam Ovens mastermind and Sam Ovens basically told

161
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:38,560
him he's like get rid of twelve of them keep one or maybe at fourteen and said

162
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,680
he said keep one and he got rid of he got rid of everything except for one

163
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:46,440
offer and he scaled up to five hundred thousand dollars per month so guys my

164
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,000
number one thing I want to tell you guys is as we're gonna get in we're gonna

165
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,160
talk about a bunch of different niches it's gonna be exciting it's gonna be

166
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:59,320
fun it's gonna stimulate the brain juices my advice to you is stick with a

167
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:05,920
couple niches and stick with the boring niches until your bills are paid okay I

168
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:10,800
would personally recommend until you've gotten one to three deals I would I would

169
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:16,560
stay air on the side of three do not go into multiple niches stay in pick a

170
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:21,360
boring niche okay a boring it's a concrete a tree surface a fencing a

171
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:28,080
spray foam insulation a masonry you guys know all these gutter installation

172
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,520
all these ones that we always talk artificial grass pick one of those go

173
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,880
get your first one two and three deals that's my number one piece of advice

174
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:41,880
okay don't go build and I know I know I'm contradicting what you guys are

175
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:47,480
hearing in other groups other groups are telling you to build ten other groups

176
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,880
are telling you to go build ten different sites in ten different cities

177
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,080
and ten different niches and I'm telling you that's a bunch of malarkey

178
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:58,880
and and most the time the people that want you to build more websites are the

179
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,040
people that benefit from you building more websites if I sell website building

180
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:11,240
material aka hosting if I sell a white labeled web web builder if I sell

181
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:18,080
tracking numbers if I sell images if I sell done-for-you services of course I

182
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,200
want you guys to build more websites but I'm here to tell you guys I think

183
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,880
that's very stupid I don't think you need to build more websites I think you

184
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,120
need to be smart about the websites that you build and instead of having a

185
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,760
shotgun approach I want you to have a sniper approach and I want you to know

186
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,240
that when you build a website you have a client and the clients paying for that

187
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,840
website and you can just knock them out and you know you have one in the bag

188
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:43,760
before you start building the website so again this comes back to why I said this

189
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,240
at the beginning don't just listen to what I'm saying think about it and I

190
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,040
want you to the person that's telling you to build 10 websites I want you to

191
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,280
ask them how much money they're making in this business not from selling their

192
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:56,480
program not from selling their done-for-you services or their web

193
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,040
hosting or this and that the rest I want you I want you to ask them how much

194
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,440
they're making from doing the actual business before you take their advice

195
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:08,240
okay because most these people are like the ones in the California gold rush

196
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,160
that sold the picks and the shovels but they don't they're not actually making

197
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:17,160
money from mining gold so for me I made my first however many million dollars

198
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:21,760
mining the actual gold and then I saw an opportunity that people would

199
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,320
actually pay for my knowledge because I changed the way this was done and then I

200
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:30,120
started selling the picks the shovels aka the program so that said guys number

201
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,760
one stick to boring until your bills are paid if your bills are ten thousand

202
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:38,360
dollars a month go and make sure you're making ten thousand dollars net before

203
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:44,960
you even think about going into funny niches or you know what you call

204
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:52,240
obscure niches that's number one okay number two I don't think well this is my

205
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:58,480
opinion is when in 2020 when I decided and my goal in 2020 is I was like all

206
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,680
right I'm gonna become very focused I'm gonna go into one niche and that was

207
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,560
tree service right that was the only niche I the only niche I dealt with in

208
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:12,240
2020 in 2020 was tree service now because I had been in these other

209
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,480
programs and I'd build all these these websites that didn't make me money but

210
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:20,800
that were whatever I had a handful of niches a handful of websites in other

211
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:25,880
niches so I had a concrete site I had a this side I had a that side I had a

212
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:30,040
towing site but that's because they were already ranking they were already

213
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:34,320
getting leads and I was like I'm gonna sell those but I'm gonna focus on tree

214
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:39,600
service so overwhelmingly most of my I would say 90% of the deals that I did

215
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,200
inside of the year 2020 were in tree service and if it wasn't inside tree

216
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:49,200
service it was because I already had a website ranking and generating leads

217
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:53,480
that I built three years before two years before that I probably wouldn't

218
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:57,000
have even done but I'd been working on it for so long that it was getting leads

219
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:03,240
so guys if you're new to this pick a niche pick a freaking niche and stick to

220
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:08,080
it now for those of you that are like oh my gosh concrete saturated yeah you're

221
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,960
gonna start seeing more lead generators than you were two years ago because

222
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:14,560
we've been talking about concrete for years but you know what's funny is if

223
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:18,640
you guys aren't following me on YouTube or subscribe to me on YouTube you don't

224
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,280
have to but if you want to we also put out different content and I have this

225
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:28,320
new series it's gonna be an 8 to 10 part series and I'm literally going me and

226
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:35,160
Francesca she is going from A to Z on closing a new deal okay A to Z from idea

227
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:39,240
to deal in the bag to credit card collected and we're gonna do this eight

228
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:43,800
parts we did part one in fact Aaron or Jason one of you guys go on to YouTube

229
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:49,080
please get that first video part one and share it in the chat we did part one and

230
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,000
the reason I'm bringing this up is because the guess what niche we're gonna

231
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,760
use freaking concrete concrete and she came to me with this niche and she's

232
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:03,440
like hey I have this city in this niche in concrete now and I literally Aaron

233
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,960
can testify to this I was like no no there's no way there's no way that this

234
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,520
is that because if you guys once you guys find out the city you're gonna be

235
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:16,480
like there's no way that's that's that's available there's no way because it's a

236
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:21,320
well-known city sure enough looked at the CPC it's less than three dollars or

237
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:26,720
something crazy like that the search volumes over 120 she did the research on

238
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,840
the competition it's low yes there's a couple lead generators in there but

239
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:35,680
nothing that's that's scaring us off so I want you guys to know that number one

240
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:40,480
again and there's a reason I'm sticking on this point you guys should not be

241
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:46,240
going into weird stuff until you guys are paying your bills okay so your first

242
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:51,480
one to three stick and do one boring niche after you get one to three deals I

243
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:56,840
think you could you could probably go to like two or three total niches but I

244
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:01,960
would still stick to boring or tried-and-true niches until your bills

245
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,680
are paid okay and then what you're probably gonna find out this will

246
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:11,160
happen with me is once you have you know $10,000 a month coming in with tree

247
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:16,640
service concrete spray foam you're gonna go why would I why would I change what's

248
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,360
working you know that saying if it ain't broke don't fix it that's kind of what

249
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,720
it was for me I was like dude I already know this niche I already know what the

250
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,760
good search terms are I already know that the big companies in this you know

251
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:32,640
in this space I already know the gossip guys there is gossip on the interwebs

252
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,080
inside of these different niches and I was so familiar with some of these

253
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:40,400
niches I could call a business owner up and I could I could drop I knew what the

254
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,280
conferences were I knew what the you know obviously the keywords were I knew

255
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,200
where all the money was made I knew who just came into the market I knew the big

256
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,200
marketing companies that were calling all of these guys trying to get their

257
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:56,280
business I knew all these details and it allowed me to become the expert in

258
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:01,760
these spaces so again stick to boring until your bills are paid so secondly

259
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:06,640
okay and then we're gonna get into the different ideas secondly guys is I don't

260
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:12,480
think until you get to about I would say minimum thirty thousand per month up to

261
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,400
fifty thousand dollars per month I don't think you should be paying out of your

262
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:23,160
own pocket to test new niches I don't think you should be paying out of your

263
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:28,120
own pocket to test new niches until you get to thirty to fifty thousand plus per

264
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:32,800
month what I mean by that guys is what I would recommend and I'm saying this

265
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:36,600
stuff up front because I don't want you guys to get off this call and start

266
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:40,040
going into weird niches and blowing a bunch of money on ads and blowing a

267
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:43,800
bunch of money building websites in niches you shouldn't be a part of but I

268
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:47,600
don't think that you should be spending your own money to test out niches the

269
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,640
reason being is once you start to get into business once you've been doing

270
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:56,880
this a long time once you crush it for one to five clients you do a really good

271
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,840
job they're making money you're happy they're happy what's gonna happen is

272
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,800
you're gonna have business owners are gonna come to you with ideas they're

273
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,840
gonna come to you with niches they're gonna come to you with their partners

274
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,640
they're gonna come to you with their family members and their referrals and

275
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,560
they're gonna say hey I know you're crushing it for me in concrete but my

276
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:22,400
brother-in-law he's got this he's got an XYZ business in the same city and I was

277
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,960
wondering if you could help him out as well and guess what now that person's

278
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:32,160
coming to you you being the expert you have leverage because they're coming to

279
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:36,400
you you're not going to them and now you get to use their money to test out this

280
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,160
new niche you're gonna make money and you're gonna get an education at the

281
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:43,640
same time and if you just stick to the boring niches and you just focus on

282
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:47,640
getting to where your bills are paid and scaling up to 30 50 thousand dollars per

283
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,880
month I promise you if you're doing a good job you're gonna get a ton of

284
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,480
people that are gonna reach out to you whether it's current business owners

285
00:21:53,480 --> 00:22:00,080
with you know complementary businesses other businesses partners friends

286
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,800
whatever this is going to happen I've had this happen so many times so I'll

287
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:07,200
give you an example and I've shared this before but I had a guy that we were

288
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:14,520
selling fencing leads to in Arizona okay and this deal that we had currently

289
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,760
it was it was at least $1,000 a month he might have been paying us $1,200 I can't

290
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:22,160
remember but we had this deal and we had a goal that month to get you know an

291
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:27,000
extra $10,000 per month in monthly recurring revenue and I said it with my

292
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,120
team and I said hey if we do this here's gonna be the bonuses so we're gonna go

293
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:33,760
do this as a team whatever and I remember we were getting near the end of

294
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:39,480
the month like our 30 days and I was golfing which is always where greatest

295
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,480
the greatest things happen by the way I played twice last week it was amazing

296
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,240
and every single time by the way golfing when you're golfing and you make money

297
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:51,320
on Stripe it just it just hits differently by the way Jason already

298
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:54,200
started golfing so I wanted to mention it once you guys get that stripe

299
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:57,840
notification and you're like dude I just made $250 while I was golfing

300
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,840
something about that's just amazing anyway I was golfing and I remember the

301
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:06,880
whole I remember everything about it it was like my second or third shot and I

302
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:14,400

321
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:41,140
person we've ever even heard of I didn't even know cactus removal was a freaking

322
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:46,600
niche you know and I didn't know people paid for the stuff and I basically said

323
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:50,040
it's on you it's your risk we're gonna do the exact same thing we did with

324

masonry or sorry with fencing but like we don't know exactly what's gonna

325
00:24:56,040 --> 00:25:00,720
happen but if you want to try it be our guest we quoted him high and he already

326
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:06,640
trusted us so he's like yeah let's do it and so dude that that was one of the

327
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,960
best freaking webs I don't even know if we still have that that specific client

328
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,960
I know for at least two years we made money and the reason I don't know is

329
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,960
because I don't I don't run the day-to-day inside of my agency we still

330
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:22,640
do deals we got a deal last not last Monday it was a week ago from Friday

331
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,940
we've got a $1,700 a month artificial grass deal we also got another tiny baby

332
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:32,000
deal of $300 a month we got we added $2,000 a month in revenue in the last

333
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,800
ten days or not ten days eight six business days and Francesca did all of

334
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:41,120

335
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:45,760
all I want to tell you guys about we made over $20,000 doing cactus removal do

336
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:51,720

digital resource and with all the ideas and all the notes from this this call so

346
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:34,300
a couple ideas guys and I tried to put these in you know somewhat in order of

347
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:40,020
the way they came to my mind but also just know that you know you need to

348
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:43,980
remember that the most important thing is a hungry business owner okay so you

349
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:49,420
want to think what I'm giving you these ideas think about you know how is that

350
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:53,060
this person a hungry business owner well I don't know well the fact that they're

351
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:57,660
doing this thing does that make them hungry or do we not know that should be

352
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:00,220
the lens that you look at all these different ideas and you should prioritize

353
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:05,380
the the the hungry business owner is the number one thing okay and I'll give you

354
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:10,380
some examples as we're going so first one I'm gonna just toss out is mailers

355
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:19,340
okay guys if you guys get mail which I still do and I used to get so annoyed I

356
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:23,180
used to get so freaking annoyed at these and I was like dude what are they doing

357
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:28,140
there's there's these little cards there's you guys know those books I

358
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,780
should have brought my book up here but you know those there's always like the

359
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:34,580
local coupon book I don't know where mine's at there's always that local

360
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:38,900
coupon book in your city right sometimes they're paid books those are

361
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:43,500
even better which there's a guy one of my buddies names Tony here in my city

362
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:48,580
he has this book called Dixie Direct and literally his entire business guys he

363
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:53,100
goes to local business owners they pay him to put their ad in this book they

364
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:56,780
pay him like a couple thousand bucks a year to put their ad in this book and

365
00:27:56,780 --> 00:28:02,020
basically they give a free offer so think about it they're paying him to put

366
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:08,660
their company name their flyer their ad in his book and on top of that they're

367
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:13,140
giving away a freebie that's how bad they want business guys mailers are so

368
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:18,700
good somebody went through the hassle of putting this together designing it going

369
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:23,340
and getting this you know they're paying who knows what this is a hungry business

370
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:27,940
owner right they're looking for more business this is a hungry business owner

371
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:33,620
so anytime I get these before you just throw them away I have stacks of these

372
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:38,320
things guys and I did this on a call a couple weeks ago but like dude as soon

373
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,860
as my duct cleaning client decides that he's done with me which he's been with

374
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:46,380
me since 2020 so I don't think he's going anywhere this guy right here duct

375
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:50,380
pros it's my guy I'm calling this guy he's spending money on on air ducts and

376
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:55,300
he's given 15% off and duct cleaning already is not that high much of a high

377
00:28:55,300 --> 00:29:01,540
ticket item so these type of things look you know landscaping concrete

386
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:58,780

388
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:13,260

389
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:20,460
look at that flyer dude we love pavers that's a big old flyer full page okay

390
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:25,140
this is a great place to start if you guys see these in the mail keep them if

391
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:28,620
you're looking for niche ideas keep them these are hungry business owners okay

392
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:33,940
that's idea number one number two people that knock on your door you know like

393
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:36,700
somebody knocks on your door and everyone gets weird about it and you

394
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:40,140
want to drive them off the porch and you want to tell them to get lost and get a

395
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:43,260
real job well I used to be a door knocker so quit being mean to those

396
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:47,060
people okay number one but I have a soft spot in my heart for door knockers

397
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:52,780
because I used to knock doors I spent four years paying for my kids school and

398
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:58,020
food and housing and our entire lifestyle was was based on me knocking

399
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:03,020
doors so anytime somebody knocks on my door basically I bought like literally I

400
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:05,220
don't know the last time you knock somebody knocked on my door I didn't buy

401
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:11,060
and my kids get weird like everyone gets weird about door knockers these are

402
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:14,780
humans guys they're freaking humans they're they're way more scared than you

403
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:20,380
are go talk to them if they're knocking on your door then if it's their company

404
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:24,220
they're super hungry if it's the company they're representing the company they're

405
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:27,220
representing is also hungry because they're paying to have a door-to-door

406
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:31,540
canvassing program if somebody knocks on your door go talk to them get their

407
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:35,500
business card like have a conversation that doesn't mean you have to use their

408
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:38,860
service but you know what I like to do is if it's something that's interesting

409
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:42,580
that I think could be a good niche I'll say hey come back give me a quote and

410
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:47,820
while they're giving me a quote dude I'm pitching these people on on on working

411
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:53,440
with me there was a guy that knocked on my door and he did was it landscape

412
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,100
maintenance not a niche that I would ever do again but he knocked on my door

413
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:01,680
he's like yeah here's the deal and he was a very like he was like a good clean

414
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:07,060
cut kid I took his number and I only had this tiny little front yard at the time

415
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:10,660
I didn't finish my backyard but I texted him I said hey dude just wanted to run

416
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:14,580
an idea past you and I pitched him over text I was like I do actually do lead

417
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:18,520
generation blah blah blah would you be interested in talking and I actually got

418
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:22,740
him as a client I actually got this guy's it wasn't a huge client but I got

419
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:26,140
this guy as a client and he knocked on my door so when they knock on your door

420
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:29,540
know that they're hungry either it's their company or the company that sent

421
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:33,460
them they are hungry for business they are literally sending people door to

422
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:36,980
door to get your business quit being scared of people knocking on your door know

423
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:40,580

look type in the word niche has anyone tried this niche type in just you know

453
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:45,380
smart words smart phrases inside of the search bar and look at what other people

454
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:48,660
are talking about do it inside of the art of digital real estate my group do

455
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:54,220
it inside of rank and rent domination which by the way is also a good group

456
00:34:54,220 --> 00:35:00,540
Ryan Dalton has that group you guys can check that group it's some of you guys

457
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:04,300
that are inside of digital landlords if I don't know if there's anyone in here

458
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:08,420
besides Jason Aaron I didn't really pay attention but guys these are great

459
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:13,340
resources like look again we're just thinking of ideas right free group is a

460
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:19,500
great place to get ideas next this is one of the ones I really really like is

461
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:23,940
Facebook community groups local community local Facebook community

462
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:30,380
group so for example here in st. George I think I'm gonna tell you what my my

463
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:35,620
groups called I seem to always pull deals from hold on one sec so what you

464
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:40,860
could do is type in your city so type in st. George or Vegas or whatever and then

465
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:46,140
click on groups and look at the different groups so right here st. George

466
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:53,340
word of mouth st. George word of mouth 52,000 members that is literally a group

467
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:56,860
I'm gonna click on it and tell you the details here welcome to st. George word

468
00:35:56,860 --> 00:36:00,020
of mouth the point of this group is to be a place where residents can come ask

469
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:05,180
or recommend businesses in the area okay now some of these groups are a bit

470
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:09,060
spammy yes but let me tell you some of the ones I'm a part of I'm not even in

471
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:12,340
that group there's so many groups in here I should be I should be hitting these

472
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:14,740
group I'm gonna tell Francesca hit these groups because I'm not even in them

473
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:18,860
right now but type that in look at them and then guys what you're gonna notice

474
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:21,900
I know I'm in some of these groups I want to find one that I'm a part of hold

475
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:28,260
on let me go to my groups um guys in these group people are going to ask for

476
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:33,980
recommendations hold on one sec let me go ahead and go to groups I've joined let

477
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:42,340
me find an example okay um st. George that's a yard cell group not my favorite

478
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:48,020
type of group let me see if I'm in another st. George group let me see if I

479
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:53,500
could search about the groups I'm in okay no that one never let me in let's

480
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:57,540
look at st. George classified okay st. George classified then I'm gonna go to

481
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:01,700
the search bar I'm gonna type in recommend okay typed in the word

482
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:08,860
recommend and I'm gonna see if anything pops up hold on this is kind of a weird

483
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:12,940
group it's more like just straight anyway we could scroll through let me

484
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:17,180
see if I can see anything I'll pop my head and then if not I won't waste any

485
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:21,100
time well guys you could scroll these groups you can look for you know people

486
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,780
that are recommending that group that I just mentioned though that sounds like

487
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:26,500
that the perfect group to be a part of I'm gonna actually request access right

488
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:34,660
now so again go to groups type in your city st. George Vegas whatever st. George

489
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:38,140
word-of-mouth I'm gonna push join it's probably gonna ask me questions there we

490
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:43,100
go blah blah I'll do that after okay that's a great place to come up with

491
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:48,860
ideas okay so another thing even not inside of groups is you can go to

492
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:53,300
Facebook and just search the actual regular search bar and type in you know

493
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:59,380
smart words so type in recommend and type in the city so I typed in recommend

494
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:04,620
st. George okay beautiful great example I typed in recommend st. George now this

495
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:12,020
is old but we could filter this I believe by by date but I'm just gonna

496
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:15,340
give you a couple ideas so like right here looking to put a pool in our

497
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:22,180
backyard who do you guys recommend okay and I actually like that post so I must

498
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:26,260
have reached out okay so that's somebody that is a lead guys I could literally

499
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:30,220
listen to this I could literally reach out to that person especially because

500
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:35,860
look with that person I have ten mutual friends I can reach out to that person I

501
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:39,380
could say hey I have this I have a recommendation for you you may or may

502
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:42,100
not know me it looks like we have ten mutual friends can I recommend somebody

503
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:46,460
for you guess what that is now a lead I didn't even have to pay for Google Ads

504
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:50,300
and I have a lead that I can use to go and find a business owner now pool

505
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:54,620
installation not loving that niche right now because of the recession it's

506
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:59,020
kind of dipped off but I've made some money in that in that niche okay let's

507
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:02,860
see what else we got need an AC guy who do you guys recommend that's amazing

508
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:08,580
don't love the niche but it's an idea right can anyone recommend a good bug

509
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:16,460
man oh here we go four days ago looking to get quotes for concrete in st. George

512
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:32,380
guys again we're just talking about generating niche ideas but this also

513
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:37,180
gives me an idea of who's good in town Bryce kid new edition concrete I've

518
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:04,780

519
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:09,820
guys looking for an architect that does home remodels that seems a little too

520
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:14,620
niche I'm not sure that I would do that one uh what else we got for

521
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:24,300
recommendations what else what else that's hair I'm not gonna be doing hair

522
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:31,180
plumbing says I need a plumber what else lucky looking for the best realtor

523
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:36,340
lender team that's not a niche that I like dentist again not all these are

524
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:41,100
going to be the ones you want but this is just a great place to start looking

525
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:46,420
for a videographer for an event this was July 31st less than a month ago okay

526
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:50,660
anyway just giving you guys ideas that's a great place to come up with niche

527
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:53,460
ideas okay let's keep going through these really quick so I can get one or

528
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:58,700
two questions another great place to come up with ideas is services that you

529
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:02,580
need done around your house services that you need done around your house you

530
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:07,220
need your carpets cleaned you need your house clean you need your pool clean you

531
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:12,780
need new concrete I just barely bought a new car about eight months ago nine

532
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:20,940
months ago and it's a very low car and so my my curb it almost scrapes my Tesla

533
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:24,340
and so I was like dude it's gonna scrape the crap out of this new car so I had to

534
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:28,420
go and I had to cut the concrete almost down to you know make it so it was

535
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:32,500
almost flush with the the ground that's it I'd never even thought out this

536
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:36,940
niche concrete cutting it's not concrete flat work it's not concrete decorative

537
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:42,620
concrete concrete cutting so it was something I needed done so now that's

538
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:45,580
you know that's an idea I never even thought about that right what else do

539
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:48,980
you need done at your house pressure washing I was just barely thinking about

540
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:52,660
how dirty my house like I'm gonna use that's that could be do I like the niche

541
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:57,220
no but if I did I could use that what else do I need obviously mobile car

542
00:41:57,260 --> 00:42:00,900
detailing epoxy garage floor if you're looking to do that I just did that on my

543
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:05,220
townhome that's a great place services that you want or need done at your house

544
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:08,700
okay I think those are two different things services that you need done at

545
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:13,300
your house those are a little bit better I need my tree removed services that you

546
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:18,100
want done at your house I want my garage epoxy right the one that you need done

547
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:20,780
that's probably a little bit better because there's probably other people

548
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:25,300
that need it done and services that you want are still good but they're probably

549
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:29,460
not gonna be as recession proof so those are two different things the services

550
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:34,540
that you need done and the services that you want done I was looking up the other

551
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:39,140
day I was in my kitchen and I saw I had a really dirty ducts like I need to get

552
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:43,140
my ducks clean I need to get my ducks clean that's something I need to get

553
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:46,420
done I don't want to get it done but I need to get it done okay so services

554
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:50,620
that you need to get done service that you want call the company call three of

555
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:56,500
them okay have them come to your house give you an estimate while they're

556
00:42:56,500 --> 00:43:01,260
giving you an estimate pitch them they're gonna listen to what you have to

557
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:07,460
say they watch your business they watch your business okay here's some more

558
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:12,060
obvious ones home advisor guys if you go to home advisor you can go I don't even

559
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:14,860
need to do this but you can go to home advisor you can go to their main website

560
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:19,660
even though I hate home advisor I'm not gonna click on their ad and you can

561
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:24,860
literally go and it says start a project and you can just go and browse guys

562
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:30,420
there's so many ideas dude put painting lawn care landscaping kitchen keating

563
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:35,420
and cooling garage gutters ceiling insulation there are so many ideas you

564
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:41,380
could just go and search on home advisor for days another idea Angie's list go and

565
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:46,460
look guys home advisor angel the one thing I don't like about these is there

566
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:51,900
so many ideas that you could become overwhelmed and I I generally like the

567
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:57,340
idea of like I would I would prefer doing like a Facebook recommendation is

568
00:43:57,340 --> 00:44:01,340
more interesting to me because I could use that as a lead and I can it

569
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:05,260
literally proves to me that there's people looking for that service it kind

570
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:09,140
of gives me an idea if I see multiple people looking for pools in my area I'm

571
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:12,540
like okay pools is pretty popular in this area right you know the other good

572
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:17,340
thing is you don't have to do the Facebook groups in your city I could go

573
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:25,580
and look at recommendations Las Vegas recommendations whatever let's just think

574
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:31,580
of another city Glendale Arizona recommendations Queen Creek Arizona

575
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:35,700
right the reason I like doing your own backyard is because you have mutual

576
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:40,020
friends you can reach out to so home advisor Angie's list also guys banners

577
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:44,980
hanging at local sporting events they're paying to be there right they're paying

578
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:50,420
to have their name hung on the freaking chain link fence and then also I

579
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:54,220
mentioned car wraps people are paying thousands of dollars I spent like

580
00:44:54,220 --> 00:45:00,140
$3,000 to wrap a smart car I've spent up to $5,000 to wrap these are expensive

581
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:04,780
wraps they want more business so mailers people who knock on your door free

582
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:09,020
groups local community and recommendation groups services you need

583
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:12,060
done at your house services you want done at your house home advisor Angie's

584
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:17,820
list banners hanging at local sporting events and car wraps those are ten ideas

585
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:23,020
you could not possibly go and list all the niches if you just looked at three

586
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:27,340
of those ideas okay so real quick I'm gonna stay on for like three four five

587
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:30,860
more minutes Aaron or Jason are one of you guys available to go through

588
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:33,500
questions comments really quick let's try to knock through some of them if one

589
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:38,340
of you guys are still on who's on right now yeah I don't see Aaron on here so I

590
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:41,540
can take care of it okay Jason we have any questions comments let's see if we

591
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:46,300
go we can get through in five minutes and by the way in one minute I'm gonna

592
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:49,380
have you screenshot because the people that stayed up until the hour I want

593
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:51,900
them to get the digital resource on anyone that wants to stay on the last

594
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:54,940
five minutes you're free to do so but you don't have to get the resource so why

595
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:57,660
don't you go ahead and actually just go ahead and screenshot everybody that's on

596
00:45:57,660 --> 00:46:03,060
right now so we can send them the digital resource by the way Jason

597
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:07,860
already is on this call he is Donnie Dre inside the free group Jason you're at

598
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:15,500
13 or $14,000 per month well okay oh sorry sorry I just went into the

599
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:24,180
snapshot mode so one thing that happens are you at 13 or 14 thousand I was just

600
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:29,180
trying to make sure people knew so I actually lost a deal that was $800 per

601
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:34,380
month so I went back a little bit had a small setback now you're at 13 or you're

602
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:42,300
I was at 13 8 just probably went back to 13 this guy literally gave him 14 leads

603
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:48,100
in two weeks and he said they weren't good enough so I look at this as a very

604
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:52,420
good thing so small setbacks like this are actually really good things for your

605
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:56,580
business because it allows you to find somebody who's more hungry and will take

606
00:46:56,580 --> 00:47:03,460
advantage of receiving 14 weeds in two weeks so $13,000 per month right now

607
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:06,460
beautiful okay so I'm just saying I'm just mentioning that so people know

608
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:09,620
that you're you're legit you're not just some whatever so Jason let's go to the

609
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:18,100
comments but yeah you're good bro yeah okay sorry had to take that screenshot

610
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:26,060
real quick um so we have uh Amy D. Hoog she's just referring to some niches

611
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:32,780
refrigeration for dairy wineries or distilleries so she's just bringing up

612
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:40,100
so is this for me to like give my thoughts yeah um I first and foremost

613
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:44,820
guys let me remind everyone that every niche you can generate leads for no

614
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:48,220
matter what it is I promise you I've done some really competitive what you

615
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:52,380
can generate leads for everything everything doing this model but it's

616
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:58,580
it's varying scales of success so I think about how many boxes does it check

617
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:02,420
is it is it phone driven if it checks that I go to the next one is it is it

618
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:05,900
branded if it checks that do I go to the next one or is it unbranded sorry is

619
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:10,460
it a high ticket and you just start going down the list so I'm gonna like

620
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:13,860
that one for example I don't know anything about that niche but to me that

621
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:17,700
sounds like something that's like you it's not mobile right that's something

622
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:24,460
that's like a brick-and-mortar or am I wrong like that fits more into the HVAC

623
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:29,100
right okay okay I thought it was like something to actually like these okay

624
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:32,260
so yeah that would that does sound like it was fit I don't know anything about

625
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:35,460
that Nick tell me what it's called again what she said it called you said

626
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:41,700
refrigeration for dairy and wineries and distilleries or so large

627
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:49,180
refrigeration systems I'm yeah industrial refrigeration um yeah I mean

628
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:56,620
so I don't love HVAC but this sounds like a sub niche of HVAC it's commercial

629
00:48:56,620 --> 00:49:02,300
refrigeration so it looks like this is saying like I don't even know anything

630
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:07,020
about this but it's yeah this that could be interesting so um cold storage for

631
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:10,660
breweries if you're talking about the person that actually goes and fixes or

632
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:14,900
does the repairs and the maintenance on these type of things that could be very

633
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:18,820
interesting because that is a sub niche of a much more competitive niche I like

634
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:22,540
that because it's specific the only thing you could get into is because it's

635
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:26,860
so neat niche I'm not sure that there's gonna be a ton of companies that are

636
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:30,500
doing it which means that the one person in town that's doing it might be getting

637
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:34,780
all the business already but I like that you're taking a niche that is very

638
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:39,460
competitive HVAC and you're sub niching it's like going to plumbing and going to

639
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:45,420
what's the one that everyone does like sewage or you know what I'm talking

640
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:50,580
about right where they go and you know I'm talking about Jason not sewage you

641
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:54,420
talking about the septic tank pumping septic room is it septic tank removal or

642
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:59,460
whatever septic septic cleaning I don't know that yeah if it's a if it's a

643
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:02,820
competitive niche make sure you're going to submit so this one I'm not a know but

644
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:05,220
I just don't know anything about it I have to do more research but that's a

645
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:08,420
very interesting niche I've never even thought about it but that's very very

646
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:12,700
niche imagine it basically industrial refrigeration technician or whatever I

647
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:16,740
don't even know what the term is so I'm not a know on that one I know it's gonna

648
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:20,420
be high ticket the only thing that sounds a little bit scary for me is that

649
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:23,660
there might not be a lot of people so if you go into a big enough city and it's

650
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:32,100
low competition yeah that could be very interesting what else now Martin says so

651
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:37,740
he's recommending another niche it's water well installation that said that

652
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:44,660
is again I know that one's gonna be high ticket because my dad's a farmer and I

653
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:50,780
know how much he spends on doing a water well I don't know how much demand if you

654
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:54,780
can go into a city where there's demand there's a lot of money in water wells it

655
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:58,340
costs I don't know if you guys know the work that goes into that they have to

656
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:02,460
they have to figure out where the water where to drill and then they literally

657
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:07,900
like I think at my dad's farm they've they have to drill hundreds of feet to

658
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:13,900
get into these aquifers and it's expensive it's multiple ten thousand

659
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:20,980
dollars to do it's very expensive so I like it I just as long as there's volume

660
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:24,700
and then again the only thing I would think that might be a little bit tough

661
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:29,340
is I'm thinking like my dad he's not going to Google to search for somebody

662
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:32,380
to put in a water well he's gonna call his other buddy that's a farmer and say

663
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:38,260
hey Ken who do you use or hey Tony who do you use that's the only thing that

664
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:42,020
would scare me about that everything else sounds good I've never done it just

665
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:45,100
full transparency but that's the one thing I don't like it sounds a bit of

666
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:51,380
like a bit more of a referral type of niche and you want to consider a little

667
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:56,100
bit of the closing process too if it takes several months for a job to

668
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:59,620
process and for them to get all the licensing and stuff they need and then

669
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:04,980
pass code and stuff it's probably not a niche that's ideal because it's gonna

670
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:08,940
take several months to close the job yeah that would be one of those again

671
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:13,340
guys once you get into you know paying for your bills and you're good then then

672
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:16,900
you start tapping in this kind of thing but yeah write it down have a have a

673
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:19,780
note in your phone of interesting ideas and it's something you could look into

674
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:27,340
any other ones yeah um let's see so let's do two more we'll call it okay so

675
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:34,580
Ameya she is so roofing and house painters as two niches that's what

676
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:38,940
she's recommending I don't even know she's recommending because she might

677
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:43,540
have also she could be asking I don't like oh sorry yeah asking about that

678
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:47,100
sorry I don't like either of them roofing if you want to go into roof

679
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:50,740
repair or you want to go into metal roofing or tile roofing you want to go

680
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:57,140
to a sub niche niche of roofing okay painting I don't like it nor have I

681
00:52:57,140 --> 00:53:02,620
found anyone that is in love with that that niche either so let me save you

682
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:09,660
some time last one Martin is recommending or asking about drilling

683
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:19,940
holes and like core drilling for concrete yes I again I I would look at

684
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:23,540
search volume I would look at job size like how much does it cost to do

685
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:26,300
something like that I don't even know what that service is you drill a hole in

686
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:34,740
the concrete for what do you call so I actually talked to a concrete guy and

687
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:39,500
because I was like hey dude I can get you leads for concrete and there's a guy

688
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:46,140
I knew and he he's like oh I only focus on cutting and drilling holes doing core

689
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:50,300
drilling and I looked at the search volume and there was almost no search

690
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:54,100
volume for that like yeah it is something people offer but you want to

691
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:58,100
make sure that you get a good amount of volume for these sub niches also maybe

692
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:02,860
if you're in a bigger city but I can't make my guy some niches you're gonna

693
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:05,500
have to go to a bigger city which isn't the worst thing okay I'm looking at the

694
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:08,660
service right now that would kind of fit in that same category as cutting just

695
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:13,420
like I had no idea that people I had no idea that anyone I was like I when I got

696
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:20,260
my sidewalk cut down I had no idea that that was even a service like who would

697
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:24,180
ever think that you need to call somebody and pay them $5,000 to cut your

698
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:29,880
sidewalk like for what and then you're like oh I see it now but again I I can

699
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:33,480
tell you there's not that many people that are getting their driveways cut

700
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:40,040
down it's it's probably bigger jobs it's probably you know few and far between so

701
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:45,120
guys with any of these sub niches you're gonna have to go into probably bigger

702
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:49,560
cities bigger markets because that's typically where you're gonna find more

703
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:53,760
search volume so the more obscure the niche or the more obscure the niche the

704
00:54:53,760 --> 00:55:00,840
more the bigger the city most likely which isn't bad but again stick to

705
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:06,520
boring until you get to the 10 20 30 40 $50,000 I wouldn't even think about some

706
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:10,980
of this stuff until you've gotten to minimum paid your bills let's do one more

707
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:16,960
do you have any more we do one more okay I think we've kind of covered most of

708
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:22,040
people asking about the niches but James Curry says that he has a deal in the

709
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:28,360
concrete coring and cutting so there you go so yeah it's doable that that's good

710
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:31,360
news that if someone else is doing it and then my next question would be like

711
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:34,440
how many you do have one deal they have to do how much is that deal do you have

712
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:39,160
you done it across multiple because I also got a deal for let me give you an

713
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:46,920
example like I got a deal for stucco okay build a side got a deal but I can

714
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:50,920
tell you I haven't built another one because it wasn't that good so I would

715
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:54,560
be interested in James Curry to know and you could maybe post it or people

716
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:58,360
could reach out to James the Facebook group but yeah there you go there's

717
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:02,120
money in it it just comes down to how much money and could I use that same

718
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:08,000
time those same resources in another niche and get way more upside way more

719
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:16,120
bang for my buck way more juice out of my squeeze or is it worth it make sense

720
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:22,200
all right that said guys appreciate you guys being on the call what we're going

721
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:26,520
to do once again if you were on ten minutes ago we screenshot it we're gonna

722
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:30,840
send you the digital resource Jason we typically have that within 24 hours

723
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:37,360
roughly right yeah I so I've been kind of bad at going through and sending them

724
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:41,680
out lately excuse me I'll make sure to get that done though and go through and

725
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:46,000
send it to everybody who's been here we get so much so many response for the

726
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,520
recording that sometimes I kind of like going back and hitting you guys up but

727
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:53,800
I'll make sure to get that done beautiful so guys thanks for being on

728
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:57,440
the call again just a reminder stay in the boring until you hit you tell you

729
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:04,000
pay your bills and again you don't need I guess I'll end with this I've made my

730
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:08,920
first seven figures in five or less niches like I had if you looked at all

731
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:14,160
of my put my my properties and you looked at all the niches I was in I was

732
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:18,780
in five or less and majority of those were in three you don't need to have 20

733
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:22,040
different niches you don't need to have something so obscure that you've never

734
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:26,240
thought of you don't need to have some crazy niche that that you know no one's

735
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:30,880
ever even considered to make millions of dollars you can make millions of dollars

736
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:35,000
doing boring tried-and-true basic niches and doing it again and again and again

737
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,920
the money is in the buy not the sale make sure you're spending the time and

738
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:45,080
going into the cities that going into the cities that are low-hanging in the

739
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:47,320
sense that they're low hanging fruit in the sense there's not a lot of

740
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:51,640
competition there's good search volume and you can go in and there's there's an

741
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:56,040
opportunity for you to go and rank a website and sell those leads to hungry

742
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:58,960
business owners so guys thanks for being on the call and we'll see you next week

743
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:03,280
thanks Jason
