By the way, guys, I am testing, just so everybody knows,

00:02.400 --> 00:04.360
a little side note, I am testing stuff all the time,

00:04.360 --> 00:06.760
testing Yelp, testing Bing.

00:06.760 --> 00:07.600
For those of you that are like,

00:07.600 --> 00:08.880
well, what happens if Google does this?

00:08.880 --> 00:10.020
Guys, I don't care.

00:10.020 --> 00:12.160
Guys, the strategy is sending leads up front.

00:12.160 --> 00:14.140
The strategy is providing results in advance.

00:14.140 --> 00:16.120
The technique we're using right now is Google Ads.

00:16.120 --> 00:17.800
If that shifts, if that gets more expensive,

00:17.800 --> 00:19.960
that whatever, great, we'll go find something else.

00:19.960 --> 00:22.080
If you have a site that does not have,

00:22.080 --> 00:24.440
that already has leads coming in consistently,

00:24.440 --> 00:26.520
you can skip the ads part, right?

00:26.520 --> 00:29.440
Because the ads is, it's the leads that we're trying to get.

00:29.440 --> 00:30.480
So if you don't have the leads,

00:30.480 --> 00:32.580
you need to do the ads to get the leads, to get the deal.

00:32.580 --> 00:34.000
But if you already had the leads, you don't need the ads.

00:34.000 --> 00:37.080
So technically, you could go to Facebook Marketplace

00:37.080 --> 00:39.200
and pay a VA to go scrape Facebook Marketplace

00:39.200 --> 00:40.040
and get a bunch of leads,

00:40.040 --> 00:42.320
and you could use those to close the deals, right?

00:42.320 --> 00:44.520
Technically, that'd be a technique, right?

00:44.520 --> 00:45.760
Strategies results in advance.

00:45.760 --> 00:49.040
So just quick side note B is, yeah, I agree.

00:49.040 --> 00:50.360
It's stupid, Google, whatever.

00:50.360 --> 00:53.480
I'm always testing stuff because, like, but I don't care.

00:53.480 --> 00:55.960
If Google shifts and it doesn't work as well,

00:55.960 --> 00:56.900
then we'll change.

00:56.900 --> 00:57.820
I'm testing stuff right now

00:57.820 --> 00:59.100
because I would like to find something

00:59.100 --> 01:00.660
that works better, that's cheaper.

01:00.660 --> 01:01.820
And I'm hoping there's something out there

01:01.820 --> 01:02.660
and I'll keep testing.

01:02.660 --> 01:04.220
And as soon as, as you guys know,

01:04.220 --> 01:06.820
as soon as I figure it out, I'll give it to you, okay?
