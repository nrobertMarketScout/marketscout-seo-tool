00:00.000 --> 00:15.880
All right guys, this is where the rubber meets the road. You can do all the previous steps

00:15.880 --> 00:18.560
that we've talked about. You can pick the perfect city and the perfect niche. You can

00:18.560 --> 00:24.180
build this great list. You can go and set up ads. If you do not call, if you do not

00:24.180 --> 00:27.980
do this step because of whatever reason, whether you're scared, whether you tell yourself you

00:27.980 --> 00:34.740
don't have time, it does not matter the reason. If you do not do this step, you will not make

00:34.740 --> 00:38.660
money. You will not get deals. In order for you to close deals, you need to get people

00:38.660 --> 00:41.620
on Zoom. In order for you to get people on Zoom, you need to send them leads. In order

00:41.620 --> 00:44.980
for you to send them leads, you have to call them and get them hooked. In order to hook

00:44.980 --> 00:51.260
them, you need to prospect them. You need to make the calls. Okay? Look, I understand

00:51.260 --> 00:57.300
this part can be very intimidating. This part can be scary, but it's only scary because

00:57.540 --> 01:02.100
you have been calling the wrong people. You haven't had the necessary scripts, which I'm

01:02.100 --> 01:07.580
going to give you, and that's all about to change. A lot of you have seen other people

01:07.580 --> 01:13.980
in this program that were terrified of the phone, that were absolutely doing everything

01:13.980 --> 01:20.020
they could to avoid this one thing. Ironically, this is the one thing that is going to make

01:20.020 --> 01:25.260
the difference between you making money and you not. I want to talk about why do we have

01:25.260 --> 01:30.500
to do this uncomfortable step? Why can't we just skip it? Why this piece? Because this

01:30.500 --> 01:33.820
is the part that everyone's the most scared of, so I want to talk about that really quick.

01:33.820 --> 01:39.380
Number one reason why we have to do this is because this is the one thing that every other

01:39.380 --> 01:44.940
agency owner out there avoids, and you watching this have been avoiding this most likely up

01:44.940 --> 01:49.940
until now. You've done the email campaigns, you've done the messenger chats, you've done

01:50.100 --> 01:56.340
Facebook posts and everything to avoid this thing. If you're avoiding it, every other

01:56.340 --> 02:00.540
marketer is avoiding it. We all know there are programs out there that are trying to

02:00.540 --> 02:06.980
teach you that you can get deals without cold calling. You can get deals by hiding behind

02:06.980 --> 02:12.280
your computer. You can get deals with email drips. Guess what? Most of those things will

02:12.280 --> 02:18.740
work to some extent. However, what I understand is that the things that people are unwilling

02:18.820 --> 02:25.820
to do, if I do them, I am going to have massive success very quickly. Number one reason that

02:26.700 --> 02:32.180
we're going to do this is because no one else wants to. My entire philosophy of life and

02:32.180 --> 02:39.180
with this process is I want to zig while they zag. If everybody's doing this, I want to

02:39.380 --> 02:44.900
do this because if everyone's doing something one way and most people are broke, I should

02:44.900 --> 02:50.780
probably look the other way. Second reason, guys, money loves speed. I'm going to say

02:50.780 --> 02:56.300
that a thousand times during this training and a thousand more times during my live calls

02:56.300 --> 03:02.660
and a thousand more times in our conversations in the chat and one on ones. Money loves speed.

03:02.660 --> 03:06.760
The quickest way to get to a business owner is not through an email, it's not through

03:06.760 --> 03:13.760
a messenger, it's not through a this, it's through picking up the phone and calling the

03:15.260 --> 03:19.980
person as long as we have the right number, as long as we're calling the right person.

03:19.980 --> 03:24.740
This is the quickest way to get deals. I don't know about you, but the reason that I'm in

03:24.740 --> 03:29.500
this, the reason that I discovered this process and I learned this process and I mastered

03:29.500 --> 03:35.260
this process is because I wanted to speed it up. Guys, if you don't want to speed this

03:35.260 --> 03:41.340
up, go do rank and rent. This is rent then rank. We're looking for speed. Money loves

03:41.340 --> 03:45.660
speed. The reason why we're going to do this quote unquote, and I say quote unquote because

03:45.660 --> 03:49.500
I promise you when you have the right scripts, you have somebody that knows what they're

03:49.500 --> 03:53.460
doing because they've done it thousands of times and you're calling the right people,

03:53.460 --> 04:00.180
this is not anything like cold calling as people define it. We are calling people who

04:00.180 --> 04:03.960
are already interested in our product, who are already paying for our product from somebody

04:03.960 --> 04:10.960
else more than likely and we're giving them results in advance with a script that works.

04:11.500 --> 04:17.140
This is not scary, at least compared to knocking doors and selling home security systems, selling

04:17.140 --> 04:22.940
vacuums, doing actual cold calling. The second reason we're going to do this quote unquote

04:22.940 --> 04:28.300
uncomfortable step is because it's quick. It's fast. It gets us the yes or no as quickly

04:28.300 --> 04:31.940
as possible so we can move on to the next so we can make money.

04:31.940 --> 04:37.020
Third reason that we're going to do this uncomfortable, again, uncomfortable step is because it works.

04:37.020 --> 04:43.260
It works and it always will. I believe one of the most barbaric old school things in

04:43.260 --> 04:47.680
the world is going door to door. I do not believe in going door to door to door. I did

04:47.680 --> 04:51.020
it for four years and you know what's crazy? As much as I don't believe in it, I think

04:51.020 --> 04:54.820
there's so much better uses of your time than literally getting dropped off in a neighborhood

04:54.820 --> 04:58.700
and going door to door to door with all the technology and the information that we have.

04:58.700 --> 05:04.700
I do not think that's a good use of your time, yet it still worked, guys. It still worked

05:04.740 --> 05:10.740
to the tune of me making hundreds of thousands of dollars in a summer and it is the most

05:10.740 --> 05:15.740
barbaric method out there. What we're going to do is we're going to take the concepts

05:15.740 --> 05:20.140
of that, which is direct to customer. We're going to go direct to customer, direct to

05:20.140 --> 05:23.440
the business owner, but we're going to have some information. We're going to talk to only

05:23.440 --> 05:27.940
people who are paying for leads, people who are already sold, and we're going to give

05:27.940 --> 05:32.360
them results in advance. Two things I did not do when I did my barbaric method. This

05:32.600 --> 05:38.400
works. When I say this, I mean reaching directly out. We're going to call it cold calling,

05:38.400 --> 05:44.040
but I almost want you to think of this as warm calling. The third reason that we're

05:44.040 --> 05:47.960
going to do this quote unquote uncomfortable step is because it works. The fourth reason

05:47.960 --> 05:52.520
why we do this uncomfortable step, and I laugh every time I say uncomfortable because compared

05:52.520 --> 05:56.560
to other stuff, this is not uncomfortable, but the fourth reason why we do this is because

05:56.760 --> 06:03.560
we are in charge. We are in charge of, and we can control that we pick up the phone and

06:03.560 --> 06:10.080
we dial a number and we call. I can control that. I can't always control if my email gets

06:10.080 --> 06:16.720
blocked. I can't always control if the business owner looks at their message or whatever,

06:16.720 --> 06:21.320
but when I pick up the phone and I call the phone number, I'm in total control. Now yes,

06:21.320 --> 06:24.040
I guess technically you could say, well, they might not answer, but I'm telling you right

06:24.040 --> 06:29.520
now 99% of the people that we're targeting, their personal cell phone is the one that's

06:29.520 --> 06:35.000
listed on the business. That is how low, that is the type of caliber of people that we are

06:35.000 --> 06:40.480
going after. We are going to be talking to most of these people directly to their personal

06:40.480 --> 06:45.240
cell phone. I'd say 90% of the people you're going to call, you're going to be calling

06:45.240 --> 06:48.280
their personal cell. You're not even going to be working, you're not even going to be

06:48.280 --> 06:53.720
dealing with a secretary or a tracking number or any of that. Definitely not an 800 number.

06:53.720 --> 06:57.480
We're talking directly to them. What I love about doing this is it puts us in control.

06:57.480 --> 07:01.240
We can sit down every day and say, hey, I'm going to make X amount of calls and I'm not

07:01.240 --> 07:06.560
going to have to worry about my email being blocked or this happening or my account being

07:06.560 --> 07:11.520
suspended here. We are in control. We could pick up the phone and for some reason our

07:11.520 --> 07:16.120
phone gets spammed out or whatever, it gets blocked. We can go get another number. It

07:16.120 --> 07:23.480
allows us to be in control. So guys, this is the step. This is the part where if you,

07:23.480 --> 07:28.640
this is the reality. If you do not do this step, you will not make money. So if this

07:28.640 --> 07:34.160
scares you, good. If this process, if this part of the process frightens you, terrifies

07:34.160 --> 07:40.920
you, welcome to the club. To this day, even me at this point, although this isn't near

07:41.000 --> 07:46.440
as bad as going door to door, it still gives me the butterflies and it probably always

07:46.440 --> 07:53.440
will and that to me just identifies, it just confirms that I'm doing the right thing.

07:53.440 --> 07:58.440
So guys, let's jump in and let's freaking get a business owner on the hook.
