1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,440
Uh, Luke says, ah, I didn't say in the zoom, all I asked is, yeah, you need to do that.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:06,400
It's part of the script. Luke, make sure that you let them know, because that's an objection,

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:11,680
right? Every objection that you're going to get, you want to, you want to eliminate it in the setup

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:16,080
and the setup. Part of the setup is the screencast. Part of the setup is getting on the phone with a

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,600
business owner. Sometimes I bring it up on the phone call before. I sometimes bring it on the

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,240
screencast. Sometimes I bring it up on both, right? But if I'm getting that every single time,

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,760
I'm definitely bringing that up. And I'm going to construct it in a way that doesn't feel like

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,680
I'm going to force them to do it, even though I am going to. And then if when push comes to shove,

9
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,960
we get to the call and they start telling me, Hey, I need to think about it. No, no, no,

10
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,840
I told you it's not, we wrote, man. You, you heard me. I told you on the phone. I told you

11
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,360
on the screencast, we don't do that. So, and then I'm going to hear them out, but I'm going to,

12
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,480
at the end of the day, I'm going to hold them to the fact they got in this call, knowing that I

13
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,920
don't do that. That's all I asked them and they agreed. And I'm going to get a decision. If they

14
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,480
say they want to think about it still, I'm going to say it's a no, I'm not going to let you think

15
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,200
about it. That's just how it rolls. I'm going to the next person. I'm sorry. Okay. I'm too valuable.

16
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:00,400
I'm a 10. You're a five. You have a commodity. I have something you need. I'm out. Okay.
