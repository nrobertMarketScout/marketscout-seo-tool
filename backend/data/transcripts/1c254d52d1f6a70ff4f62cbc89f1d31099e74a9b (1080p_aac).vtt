00:00.000 --> 00:15.320
Guys, before we get into the actual zoom, what we're going to do, I want to talk really

00:15.320 --> 00:17.000
quickly about best practices.

00:17.000 --> 00:20.620
These are some things that if you will do these, you're going to increase your odds

00:20.620 --> 00:22.660
and likelihood of getting the deal, okay?

00:22.660 --> 00:25.120
You're not going to do these perfectly every time you're going to forget.

00:25.120 --> 00:27.100
It's not going to be possible sometimes.

00:27.100 --> 00:31.020
You're just going to do the best that you can given what you have to work with, okay?

00:31.020 --> 00:35.420
I want to give you an example of where I learned this and how effective this was.

00:35.420 --> 00:39.420
Back when I did door-to-door sales, they taught me, my managers at the time, they taught me

00:39.420 --> 00:41.060
something really interesting.

00:41.060 --> 00:43.580
They said the closer, the same thing that we're talking about here, but they taught

00:43.580 --> 00:45.500
me some specific technical things to do.

00:45.500 --> 00:49.540
They were like, hey, the closer you follow these specific things, the more likely you're

00:49.540 --> 00:50.980
going to be to get the deal.

00:50.980 --> 00:55.700
I became very rigid, very disciplined of doing these things because it always led to a sale,

00:55.700 --> 00:56.700
okay?

00:56.700 --> 00:58.740
Let me give you one example.

00:58.740 --> 01:02.500
One thing that we always did and we were taught to do is when you go in the home, they said,

01:02.500 --> 01:06.420
hey, when you go in the house, the first thing you're going to do is you're going to identify

01:06.420 --> 01:07.420
the kitchen table.

01:07.420 --> 01:10.100
You're going to go over to the kitchen table, you're going to take your binder and your

01:10.100 --> 01:13.660
iPad, you're going to set it right at the kitchen table exactly where it's going to

01:13.660 --> 01:17.460
be the best place to talk to both the husband and wife, okay?

01:17.460 --> 01:20.680
Or both spouses or both partners, whatever.

01:20.680 --> 01:26.300
The reason why you do this is because business is more likely to happen at the kitchen table

01:26.420 --> 01:27.540
than at the couch.

01:27.540 --> 01:30.540
And statistically speaking, if you sit at the couch, people are going to be relaxed,

01:30.540 --> 01:35.220
they're going to be distracted, and they just think that they're talking or just talking

01:35.220 --> 01:38.100
about the overall concept, but we're not getting down to business.

01:38.100 --> 01:41.260
But when you sit at the kitchen table, people know that you mean business.

01:41.260 --> 01:45.100
You're there to look at stuff, you're there to sign papers, you are doing a deal at the

01:45.100 --> 01:46.280
kitchen table.

01:46.280 --> 01:50.540
So since business happens at the kitchen table, not the couch, avoid the couch at all measures.

01:50.540 --> 01:53.860
Go put the binder at the kitchen table and you will close more deals.

01:54.700 --> 01:58.220
I did everything I could to make sure that was the case.

01:58.220 --> 02:01.180
And I will tell you, there were some times they didn't have a kitchen table.

02:01.180 --> 02:05.080
In a few instances, there was no kitchen table, so I did the best that I could.

02:05.080 --> 02:10.300
There was a few times when they were insistent that we sit at the couch because the husband

02:10.300 --> 02:14.020
was in a wheelchair or the kitchen table was full of stuff.

02:14.020 --> 02:16.820
But even when it was full of stuff, I would just say, hey, it's fine, let's just push

02:16.820 --> 02:17.820
some stuff to the side.

02:17.820 --> 02:20.180
Like there was times there was mounds of stuff, right?

02:20.180 --> 02:21.860
Disgusting, like syrup on the counter.

02:21.860 --> 02:26.660
I would still sit at the kitchen table because I knew that's where deals happen.

02:26.660 --> 02:27.980
So that's just one example.

02:27.980 --> 02:31.720
So the equivalent of that with our deals are the following.

02:31.720 --> 02:34.980
First of all, the time of day that you schedule the Zoom call.

02:34.980 --> 02:36.620
It does matter.

02:36.620 --> 02:40.860
And what happens is if you leave this up to chance and you just say, hey, business owner,

02:40.860 --> 02:42.980
what time works for you?

02:42.980 --> 02:45.780
That is a bad question because they're going to give you a terrible option.

02:45.780 --> 02:49.540
They're going to say, well, I have a little lunch break here, here, here, and here.

02:49.540 --> 02:51.000
Well, let me tell you about lunch breaks.

02:51.000 --> 02:55.360
First of all, you know, as a business owner, they typically don't happen, number one.

02:55.360 --> 03:00.160
Number two, the day gets going and the lunch break that was supposed to be an hour becomes

03:00.160 --> 03:03.880
10 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, and they're rushed, right?

03:03.880 --> 03:06.480
They're in the middle of the day, they're getting calls, they're getting inquiries.

03:06.480 --> 03:08.820
They're trying to make money just like you.

03:08.820 --> 03:12.520
And so, and on top of that, like imagine they're sitting at a diner, they're sitting at a fast

03:12.520 --> 03:15.960
food restaurant and they're FaceTiming you from their phone.

03:15.960 --> 03:19.560
Again, guys, that is not the best case scenario.

03:19.560 --> 03:22.900
So here's a best practice as far as the time.

03:22.900 --> 03:27.920
Try and do it first thing in the morning or late at night, okay?

03:27.920 --> 03:31.000
That's what I have found to be the most effective and morning is definitely the best.

03:31.000 --> 03:35.880
For me, it's best because I wake up, I'm fresh, I get a deal before I even go to the gym,

03:35.880 --> 03:40.960
but also for them because they're not distracted, they're not getting hit up yet, so I like

03:40.960 --> 03:41.960
early in the morning.

03:41.960 --> 03:43.200
It's my favorite thing to do.

03:43.200 --> 03:48.600
Secondly, I like to make sure to tell them, hey, be by a computer.

03:48.640 --> 03:53.120
Now, the reason I justify it is I say, hey, I'm going to want to show you a couple things.

03:53.120 --> 03:55.480
It's going to be really hard for you to see on your tiny phone.

03:55.480 --> 03:58.080
So if you could be by a desktop, that would be perfect.

03:58.080 --> 04:01.880
Or a laptop, be somewhere quiet by a laptop because I want to show you some things and

04:01.880 --> 04:06.000
I'll usually tell them, hey, if we can do that, it's going to go a lot faster.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.720
And really the reason why is I don't want them calling me from a cell phone where they're

04:09.720 --> 04:13.100
going to be distracted, stuff's going to be coming in or they're going to feel like they

04:13.100 --> 04:16.160
can just call me from a grocery parking lot or a gas station.

04:16.160 --> 04:19.920
Guys, I've had somebody, because I didn't do this, they were going to buy dog food and

04:19.920 --> 04:23.320
thought they could just FaceTime me or Zoom me, whatever.

04:23.320 --> 04:25.720
So the first two things is the time.

04:25.720 --> 04:27.160
I prefer mornings.

04:27.160 --> 04:32.320
Second thing is make sure they're at a desktop or a laptop somewhere quiet.

04:32.320 --> 04:34.320
Third thing is day of the week.

04:34.320 --> 04:40.200
One thing that I have noticed is I've had really, really good luck getting people to

04:40.200 --> 04:43.160
jump on the phone with me on weekends.

04:43.160 --> 04:45.080
And you think about your business.

04:45.400 --> 04:49.240
Typically, your customers are bugging you because they just don't feel like they can

04:49.240 --> 04:50.600
or maybe they're not working.

04:50.600 --> 04:54.120
In weekends, you can work on your business, not just in your business.

04:54.120 --> 04:57.600
And so I've had really good luck on weekends.

04:57.600 --> 05:03.480
Outside of that, I haven't really noticed a difference as far as days of the week.

05:03.480 --> 05:09.400
So Monday, I do know Monday tends to be a lot busier, so that's one day I try to, if

05:09.400 --> 05:10.580
possible, avoid.

05:10.580 --> 05:11.580
But you know what?

05:11.580 --> 05:13.120
I also want to get my deals on Monday.

05:13.160 --> 05:18.160
So I still like to do sales calls on Mondays, but it does seem that it's harder to get

05:18.160 --> 05:20.120
people to schedule on Monday.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.120
It's through the weekend.

05:21.120 --> 05:22.120
Maybe they forget.

05:22.120 --> 05:24.320
So I like to do, you know, Tuesday through Saturday.

05:24.320 --> 05:25.480
Saturday would be my best option.

05:25.480 --> 05:27.680
I personally don't do sales calls on Sunday.

05:27.680 --> 05:28.680
That's up to you.

05:28.680 --> 05:33.280
But I do know that on weekends, people are going to be working more on their business

05:33.280 --> 05:34.360
than in their business.

05:34.360 --> 05:39.040
So guys, once again, do your best to follow those best practices.

05:39.040 --> 05:42.600
Also one, maybe one last thing I'll note is sometimes business owners, they think that

05:42.600 --> 05:46.240
when you say zoom, it's going to be some crazy thing, especially these older older people

05:46.240 --> 05:47.300
that aren't used to it.

05:47.300 --> 05:48.300
Just let them know.

05:48.300 --> 05:50.960
So hey, I'm going to send you an email with a zoom link.

05:50.960 --> 05:51.960
And that's another thing.

05:51.960 --> 05:54.880
Don't text them a link or they're going to jump on their phone.

05:54.880 --> 05:58.760
Say I'm going to email you a link to zoom.

05:58.760 --> 05:59.760
And here's what's cool.

05:59.760 --> 06:01.200
Mr. Business owner, Mrs. Business owner.

06:01.200 --> 06:04.760
All you have to do is click on the link and it will automatically pop up because some

06:04.760 --> 06:08.000
of them get scared and they're like, I don't know how to zoom and I hate technology.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.640
Just reassure them that this is not a big deal.

06:11.120 --> 06:14.100
Guys, follow those exactly best that you can.

06:14.100 --> 06:17.800
Also understanding that sometimes those don't always make sense and it's always better to

06:17.800 --> 06:21.640
just go for it and try to make everything perfect and I'll see you on the next video.
