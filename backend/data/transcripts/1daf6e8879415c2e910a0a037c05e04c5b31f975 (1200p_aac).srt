1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,200
How do we fix this? How do you fix it number one?

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:06,080
You need to identify what it is to start as you start making some of you don't know what it is

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,440
By the way, you listen this like I don't know what it is. That's good. You haven't made enough offers

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,800
That's your first problem. If you don't know what your thing is, you need to start doing more shit

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,000
You're not asking enough people for enough money. You're not doing enough calls

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:25,000
Okay, once you do enough calls, you're gonna figure out real quick. What that thing is for you. Now, here's how you solve it

7
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,800
very simply

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,640
You start doing the very thing you're asking people to do

9
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,280
If you keep getting I need to talk to my partner. I

10
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,880
Need to talk to my wife

11
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:42,520
Go talk to your partner. Go talk to your wife. Hey partner. Hey wife. Do you trust me?

12
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:49,360
If something comes across my desk, that's at least actually, you know, whatever blah blah blah blah. Are you good if I make that decision?

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,120
Yes or no, okay, cool get on the same page overcome it if you have an issue with contracts

14
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:02,400
You got to unfuck your mind because guys life is contracts you have a house you have a car you have a cell phone you have

15
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,040
All these different things like life is literally contracts

16
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:10,880
Okay, if you have an issue with price you need to get around people that are spending more money

17
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,620
You need to get around people that are making more money

18
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:16,160
You need to quit going with people that when they choose where they're gonna eat

19
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:20,680
They're thinking of where can I get a meal for five bucks because they're broke as shit

20
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:26,000
Okay, you need to go sit down with somebody that goes and they don't even look they get the appetizer

21
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,520
They get the bottle of wine they get the frickin dessert

22
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,280
They get they just look at what they want and now your mind is gonna start to expand like, okay

23
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:39,780
Yeah, that's actually not that much thousand bucks not that much. I just spent three hundred dollars on dinner

24
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,280
Okay thousand bucks is nothing

25
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:47,680
That's how you overcome it. So my challenge to you guys this and then we're gonna jump into QA is

26
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:53,360
Whatever first of all, if you don't know what that objection is for you, you're not making enough offers

27
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,400
You need to do that first

28
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:59,720
But if you do know the objection if you want to overcome that and quit getting that you need to fundamentally

29
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,040
overcome this in your head and

30
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:08,500
The way that you do that is by doing the thing that you keep facing by signing the contract

31
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,520
Okay by making the decision same day

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,680
By doing it without your wife or your husband or your partner

33
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,080
Okay

34
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:25,400
Now again strategically by not worrying about buying something because it's too expensive because you know what money's money and I'm gonna make it back

35
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,560
Okay, that's how you overcome it
