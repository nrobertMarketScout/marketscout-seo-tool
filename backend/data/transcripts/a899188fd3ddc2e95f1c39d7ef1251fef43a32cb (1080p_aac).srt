1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
This is such a crucial thing you guys need to understand,

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:04,740
is you don't need to do the entire due diligence.

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:08,100
If at any point it's not checking the boxes,

4
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,500
get out and go to the next city, okay?

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,540
And Melissa, really quick, one thing I wanna just mention

6
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:16,020
is if you are having a hard time finding cities

7
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:21,020
with adequate search volume and whatever,

8
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,820
adequate search volume, but low-ish population,

9
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:28,340
then my advice, go and just do a new niche.

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,600
And it doesn't mean you're not gonna come back to concrete,

11
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,720
but sometimes you get so in one niche,

12
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,040
you get so exhausted and burned out

13
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,560
that it just defeats the purpose.

14
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,360
So my advice to you, if you're looking at a bunch of cities,

15
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:44,720
go do fencing, go try tree service, okay?

16
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:48,560
Go do that and just try that and see what you find

17
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,760
and it's gonna be refreshing

18
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,880
because you're gonna be into a new niche, okay?
