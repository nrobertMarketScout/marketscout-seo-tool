What's the trial for clients? B, I saw you make a trial deal for a thousand bucks a month. Yeah,

00:04.880 --> 00:08.880
so the trial is just the first contract. We just call it that because the clients like it,

00:08.880 --> 00:15.280
but the trial is just the deal. So, hey, Mr. Business Owner. So basically what we like to do,

00:15.280 --> 00:20.800
our Mr. Business Owner, is we start off with a 12-month trial or a six-month trial, right? Or if

00:20.800 --> 00:24.720
you have to, a three-month trial. It's a contract. It's the same thing, but they like the sound of

00:24.720 --> 00:28.960
it because then they don't feel like it's like this long-term thing. So we just term it. We just

00:28.960 --> 00:32.640
coin it like trial, but it's not. It's the deal. Okay.
