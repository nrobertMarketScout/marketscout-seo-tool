WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:14.200
All right, guys, let's go ahead and get set up for the zoom close.

00:14.200 --> 00:17.960
So what I do is 20 minutes, 15, 20 minutes before the actual close.

00:17.960 --> 00:23.200
I come over to my computer, I get my tabs all dialed in in order and that way I'm ready

00:23.200 --> 00:24.200
to go.

00:24.200 --> 00:26.940
So I want everything to be clean so I can just go click, click, click, click, click,

00:26.940 --> 00:27.940
show them everything.

00:27.940 --> 00:29.600
And it's just this nice, easy process.

00:29.600 --> 00:33.400
So what I'm going to have you guys do hop over with me to my screen.

00:33.400 --> 00:37.040
All right, guys, so what I'm looking at here and this we're going to reference this more

00:37.040 --> 00:38.160
in the next lesson.

00:38.160 --> 00:45.420
But I do want to mention that in the FFM closing script 2.0, I have put the that says zoom

00:45.420 --> 00:46.420
close prep.

00:46.420 --> 00:47.840
I like to put my tabs in order.

00:47.840 --> 00:53.720
I'm actually going to move this so that it's right here at the top.

00:53.720 --> 00:56.200
And this is the tabs that I like to pull up.

00:56.400 --> 00:59.800
So I like to have something for my monopoly strategy.

00:59.800 --> 01:03.680
So what I'll do is I'll just have like a window open that says, you know, if I'm doing because

01:03.680 --> 01:06.160
in this example, I'm using Queen Creek concrete.

01:06.160 --> 01:12.120
So I would like to use either some some other project in Queen Creek, which I could, but

01:12.120 --> 01:14.680
I think it's more effective to use somebody in concrete.

01:14.680 --> 01:16.640
So I'm going to use the Bentonville concrete example.

01:16.640 --> 01:19.640
So I've just typed in in Google concrete Bentonville.

01:19.640 --> 01:24.320
OK, now you can be strategic here if you're not ranked for every keyword, you may want

01:24.320 --> 01:27.880
to go ahead and search for the keyword that you are ranked the best for so you don't look

01:27.880 --> 01:29.560
like an idiot when you do that.

01:29.560 --> 01:30.560
And I've done that before.

01:30.560 --> 01:33.080
I'm like, hey, let me go ahead and search this.

01:33.080 --> 01:35.560
I search it and I'm like, oh, where's my website?

01:35.560 --> 01:39.840
So just, you know, this one, I know for this, I rank for almost anything.

01:39.840 --> 01:40.840
So I'm not as worried.

01:40.840 --> 01:43.720
But if you're only ranked for like five out of 10 terms, make sure to use the ones that

01:43.720 --> 01:44.720
you're ranked for.

01:44.720 --> 01:45.720
OK, so I have this.

01:45.720 --> 01:49.760
That's one of the windows I like to have pulled up one of the tabs case studies.

01:49.880 --> 01:55.040
So you can either use like, and this says case studies slash social proof, so you can

01:55.040 --> 01:59.880
either have, you know, like we talked about in the screencast, you have text message screenshots

01:59.880 --> 02:05.360
or emails or whatever that say, hey, you know, we've closed this huge deal, whatever.

02:05.360 --> 02:07.880
Or case studies could be your actual website.

02:07.880 --> 02:12.000
So what I'll probably do is I'll have this website actually pulled up.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.360
So I'll have another tab with this website pulled up.

02:15.360 --> 02:20.560
And then the other thing that I do as far as like case studies is I like to show with

02:20.560 --> 02:24.440
the projects that are really producing leads, I like to show the leads.

02:24.440 --> 02:30.080
Now, I don't recommend that you show the leads if you're not getting leads or if you're pre-selling,

02:30.080 --> 02:31.080
right?

02:31.080 --> 02:33.560
Or if this is your first project, sorry, not if you're pre-selling, but if this is your

02:33.560 --> 02:39.280
first project and you don't have another project to say, hey, look how many leads this is getting.

02:39.280 --> 02:40.280
Don't show them.

02:40.280 --> 02:43.040
OK, only show what you have.

02:43.040 --> 02:44.180
Does that make sense?

02:44.180 --> 02:46.540
Now, I don't want you guys, this is what you got to be careful of.

02:46.540 --> 02:48.340
I can make this look however I want.

02:48.340 --> 02:53.060
I could get these guys, whoever this is, to believe that I can produce a lot of leads

02:53.060 --> 02:55.260
based on what I'm seeing, what I'm showing here.

02:55.260 --> 02:59.220
I could also get them to believe that I can rank anything based on my rankings.

02:59.220 --> 03:02.580
But what you got to be careful of is you can paint this picture however you want.

03:02.580 --> 03:06.260
But remember, if you oversell, you will deal with it later.

03:06.260 --> 03:09.920
OK, so I'm going to show the leads just to show them the ability, but I'm still going

03:09.920 --> 03:13.060
to pitch them on the 12 to 15 lead range.

03:13.060 --> 03:14.860
I'm not going to have them expecting this.

03:14.860 --> 03:20.220
I'm just going to show them the ability that I have to potentially get them this many.

03:20.220 --> 03:21.500
So they know I'm not messing with it.

03:21.500 --> 03:23.900
But some of you guys are going to watch this and go, well, I don't have any leads.

03:23.900 --> 03:25.260
I don't have any sites producing leads.

03:25.260 --> 03:26.260
It's OK.

03:26.260 --> 03:27.460
Just don't show the leads.

03:27.460 --> 03:30.300
Just don't overthink this part.

03:30.300 --> 03:33.740
Last thing I like to pull up is the lead value calculator.

03:33.740 --> 03:38.860
And if you are doing this for your first time, you may want to drop the numbers already in.

03:38.860 --> 03:44.900
So 5,000, I like to zero this out, 5,000 being the average ticket price for concrete profit

03:44.900 --> 03:45.900
margin.

03:45.900 --> 03:47.100
I'm going to put it at 20 percent close rate.

03:47.100 --> 03:48.700
I'm going to put it at 30.

03:48.700 --> 03:54.460
And then I don't like to show what would you charge per lead because I ain't going to charge

03:54.460 --> 03:55.460
per lead.

03:55.460 --> 03:58.780
OK, so you can zoom in like you could tell.

03:58.780 --> 04:01.220
Even at 100 percent, this is perfect.

04:01.220 --> 04:04.740
It shows just this on my computer, but I like to even zoom in sometimes.

04:04.740 --> 04:07.460
I don't even want them to think there's an option because I've already told them there's

04:07.460 --> 04:08.460
not.

04:09.060 --> 04:12.340
So these are the tabs that I have pulled up.

04:12.340 --> 04:13.460
I get everything ready.

04:13.460 --> 04:14.700
I make sure my audio is working.

04:14.700 --> 04:20.580
I make sure my zoom is ready to go and definitely make sure that you record these calls, make

04:20.580 --> 04:22.940
sure your Wi-Fi is good, get prepped.

04:22.940 --> 04:28.700
And then what I do is for a few minutes right before the call, I get in the zone.

04:28.700 --> 04:32.180
And I know that sounds kind of cheesy, kind of corny, but I literally think about this

04:32.180 --> 04:35.580
and I go, OK, I got a lot of shit on my plate right now.

04:35.580 --> 04:36.580
I got a lot going on.

04:36.580 --> 04:37.580
I'm thinking about a lot of stuff.

04:37.700 --> 04:38.700
I got a family, I got kids.

04:38.700 --> 04:39.700
I got this thing.

04:39.700 --> 04:40.700
I got this problem over here.

04:40.700 --> 04:47.300
I got like, for example, right now, like I literally today, I have tax stuff I got to

04:47.300 --> 04:48.300
deal with.

04:48.300 --> 04:50.100
I'm looking at buying a property.

04:50.100 --> 04:54.380
I got to go golf at, not got to, I get to go golf at five.

04:54.380 --> 04:59.260
I got to jump on the phone with somebody for another real estate thing at two.

04:59.260 --> 05:02.180
I got to zoom out like all this stuff.

05:02.180 --> 05:07.360
What I do for the five minutes before the call is I sit and I go, all right, this is

05:07.640 --> 05:10.080
everything that I am doing up to this point.

05:10.080 --> 05:14.880
The leads I'm sending, the list I'm building, the reason you're in this damn program leads

05:14.880 --> 05:16.360
to this moment right here.

05:16.360 --> 05:17.520
And I don't want you to overthink it.

05:17.520 --> 05:22.560
I don't want you to spook yourself out, but I want you to get pretty damn serious about

05:22.560 --> 05:24.760
the fact that this is what matters.

05:24.760 --> 05:29.120
And you performing for the next one hour and doing this correctly and being all in and

05:29.120 --> 05:35.600
not distracted, phone on silent, kids quiet, internet working, this is where I make money.

05:35.600 --> 05:39.080
I do a lot of shit that doesn't make money because I'm not perfect.

05:39.080 --> 05:42.540
But this activity right here is the thing that moves the needle.

05:42.540 --> 05:46.640
The more of this I do, which again, I'm talking to myself right now, like if I'm sitting there

05:46.640 --> 05:50.080
five minutes for I'm like, this is the thing I got to be a 10.

05:50.080 --> 05:52.600
This is the thing that I have to be present for.

05:52.600 --> 05:57.360
This is the thing that I need to do correctly to provide for my family, to hit my goals,

05:57.360 --> 05:59.020
to move that needle.

05:59.020 --> 06:03.600
So get dialed in, turn your damn phone off, quit getting distracted and get locked in

06:03.600 --> 06:06.800
about five minutes before mentally and get ready to go.
