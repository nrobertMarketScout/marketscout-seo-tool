WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.560
Okay. Beautiful. All right. Let me see if I can see the comments properly. Marcus Dugas.

00:07.560 --> 00:12.520
What's going on, bro? One of our day, not quite day one, but almost day one. What's

00:12.520 --> 00:19.400
up Dev Nate? What's going on? Thad. We're seeing some OGs in here. Stephanie Prather,

00:19.400 --> 00:26.320
what's going on? Jackson, my friend. What's up? Says he can hear us. Aaron Vogler, Fred

00:26.400 --> 00:37.560
Sommer, Steven Pease, Richard Martes, Bo Hicks. All right. I think we wait just two, three

00:37.560 --> 00:43.160
minutes and then I think we're just going to get into it. But what do you think about

00:43.160 --> 00:47.800
that? Does it sound good? Let's do it. That works. I also recognize a bunch of these folks.

00:48.400 --> 00:52.800
You can do some OGs in here, man. Yeah, I'm seeing some names. There's Porter, by the

00:52.800 --> 00:59.800
way. What's up, Porter? He's probably out working on the farm this early morning. Matt

00:59.800 --> 01:07.760
Torres. Guys, this is an exciting day. Yeah, let's just get into it. Let's just get into

01:07.760 --> 01:13.280
it because I want to spend as much time as possible. We have 53 minutes and I want to

01:13.280 --> 01:17.520
get as much possible. So guys, welcome to the call. Actually, let me do the everyone

01:17.520 --> 01:23.480
tag really quick. That's what I'll do. I'm not even going to do any housekeeping. Why

01:23.480 --> 01:27.400
doesn't it not let you do everyone from your computer? Is that the dumbest thing ever?

01:27.840 --> 01:32.400
Dude, it's so weird. Like I, when I do a good lot of my group, I have to like open the group

01:32.400 --> 01:37.560
in a different window and then comment in there or do it from my phone. I don't know.

01:37.960 --> 01:44.480
It's like Mark Zuckerberg's figured out how to look like an alien on his own, but he can't

01:44.480 --> 01:46.240
figure out how to use the everyone tag.

01:46.720 --> 01:51.160
Yeah, or the whole issue. You connect to Zoom, I guess, right? Like the virtual is doing

01:51.160 --> 01:56.600
it natively and why is it so hard to do that?

01:56.680 --> 02:01.440
It's so hard. Like why are you making it so hard, Zucks? Okay, hold on. Let me see if I

02:01.440 --> 02:07.960
can get it. There we go. Okay. At everyone. Boom. By the way, I had the weirdest dreams,

02:08.000 --> 02:16.320
dude. David Beckham's son was in my dream. Dude, what a weird dream I had. Oh my goodness.

02:16.320 --> 02:21.760
People were stealing my stuff. So we're, we're trying to get back to reality here now that

02:21.760 --> 02:29.280
I am already go. Okay. Let's see. Brayden Johnson, what's up? Raphael, what's up? Chris

02:29.280 --> 02:33.320
Art, what's up? Emily Fisher, what's up? Okay. We got a crowd. Guys, welcome to the call.

02:33.320 --> 02:40.480
Welcome to the live call. We have Ryan Dalton joining us again. Mr. 80, is it 87 or 86 K?

02:40.760 --> 02:52.320
I float between 83 and 87. He's a float. He's a float. I love that. He is our, not basically,

02:52.320 --> 02:59.560
he is our very first student ever to achieve this milestone. He has got a run rate of he's

02:59.560 --> 03:04.040
going to be hitting a, he's, you've already made a million dollars in doing this business,

03:04.040 --> 03:09.600
but now we're at big boy numbers, which is a million dollars per year as our run rate

03:09.600 --> 03:14.800
and it's only climbing. So anyway, congrats to you, bro. Yeah, man. Thanks. Yeah. Homegrown

03:14.800 --> 03:20.680
in digital landlords and art of reselling. I love it, dude. I love it. So, okay, guys,

03:20.680 --> 03:24.880
here's what we're going to do. Jason already said he's stoked for this. Juan Martinez,

03:24.880 --> 03:29.360
another day one. I'm loving some of these OGs. They're, I think they, they're excited

03:29.360 --> 03:34.400
as well because they've been hobnobbing different stuff together. So here's what we're going

03:34.400 --> 03:44.320
to do. We, Ryan has been working on something for about 15 months. Is that about right?

03:44.320 --> 03:52.960
Yeah. And I'm going to let him just share five minutes of the story behind it. And then

03:53.040 --> 03:58.320
literally this entire, what I'm going to have him do is share his screen and I'm going to have him

03:58.320 --> 04:04.880
show you guys what he has built and how seamless this is. And then at the end of this call,

04:04.880 --> 04:09.520
we are going to be offering to a certain number of people, we're going to be offering a beta,

04:10.560 --> 04:18.320
we're going to be taking on beta students. We've already started doing this with a select few,

04:18.320 --> 04:22.960
but we're going to be taking on some beta students. So at any point, if you, if this

04:22.960 --> 04:28.800
looks interesting to you, stick around to the end, because this would be the time to test this out.

04:30.800 --> 04:34.720
What do we have? Like five people that have just, for a few days, we haven't really had

04:34.720 --> 04:40.400
many issues at all. So when we say beta, basically you're just getting a deal at this point.

04:40.400 --> 04:45.600
Yeah, you're basically getting a deal. I mean, it's not, it's not like, see, beta will sometimes

04:45.600 --> 04:50.800
be used like incomplete, but that's not the case. Like it's very complete. You're, you're just like

04:50.800 --> 04:57.040
one of the first users to know what you think. Now keep in mind, I will say this, I'll say this at

04:57.040 --> 05:00.880
the end too, because we'll, we'll drop a link or whatever for the people that want to do beta.

05:00.880 --> 05:07.840
This is a paid beta. So, you know, that just keep that in mind. This isn't a free base of paid beta

05:07.840 --> 05:13.360
because this is a, something that's taken a lot of time, a lot of money, a lot of effort. Secondly,

05:13.360 --> 05:19.440
because it's beta and there is a discount, expect that there could be a flaw. There could

05:19.440 --> 05:24.400
be something that goes sideways and you have to be patient. That's why the discount is offered.

05:24.400 --> 05:29.760
We don't anticipate there being that much that's weird about it or that goes sideways. However,

05:30.880 --> 05:37.840
keep that in mind. So don't, don't hit up Ryan and say, oh my gosh, this, this little thing

05:37.840 --> 05:42.960
happened. I couldn't log in instantly. Like there's going to be potentially some hiccups. So

05:42.960 --> 05:46.960
that's part of the game. So just you've been warned. Okay. That said, I don't anticipate

05:46.960 --> 05:54.400
there being many issues at all. But so Ryan, tell these guys what, what this, like why you built

05:54.400 --> 06:00.560
what you built and guys, I, the title of this stream is what I think is going to describe this

06:00.560 --> 06:04.640
tool as I think it's going to be the only tool you're ever going to need to scale your agency.

06:05.360 --> 06:09.040
And I think the challenging part is going to be trying to figure out what to show them, what not

06:09.040 --> 06:12.000
to show them because we only have 45 minutes. So right. All right. Let's get into it.

06:12.560 --> 06:16.480
Yeah. We'll show them all the, all the fun stuff. It's all fun, but we'll show, we'll show them

06:16.480 --> 06:21.120
good stuff. So, um, all right. So I've been in rank and rant for about two and a half years.

06:21.120 --> 06:24.480
And I got into this and realized pretty quickly that there's not

06:26.000 --> 06:30.480
a great solutions out there for tools. So we're usually, what happens is this,

06:30.480 --> 06:34.240
as people get into this industry, they're like, Hey, listen, I want to do local lead generation

06:34.880 --> 06:40.640
and they've got to go find a CRM. They got to find the right CRM, right? So their content relation

06:40.640 --> 06:45.040
or their customer relationship manager, they've got to go find a keyword tool. They've got to

06:45.040 --> 06:50.400
go find a site analyzer. They've got to go find programmable voice and messaging. So what happens

06:50.400 --> 06:57.840
is inevitably everyone that does this business model is using three to four, at least different

06:57.840 --> 07:03.440
tools at minimum, uh, that are all like scattered. And the problem with that is,

07:03.440 --> 07:07.760
is the data doesn't talk to each other, right? So this was my frustration is there was not

07:07.760 --> 07:11.680
anything out there. And, and, you know, there are some tools that do more things than others,

07:11.680 --> 07:16.240
right? But there wasn't one that did it all. And so I found myself using a whole bunch of different

07:16.240 --> 07:22.560
tools and having to manually connect that create the connective tissue and places where my data

07:22.560 --> 07:29.680
needs to talk to each other. So, uh, I see we got, uh, Deb Nate on the call. Um, he said he used

07:29.680 --> 07:37.120
version 1.0. So version 1.0 was a no-code solution connecting, uh, some of these things together,

07:37.120 --> 07:42.960
where the users basically through like a sort of a mini course could go and connect these using sort

07:42.960 --> 07:49.280
of off the shelf tools. Um, that was, that was great. We've got, you know, a lot of users that

07:49.280 --> 07:53.360
use that, but it also had limitations that have a lot of limitations that I wanted to

07:53.360 --> 07:57.840
make the next version to be a lot better. And so that's what we did. Right. So built, uh,

07:57.840 --> 08:03.440
rank and run engine, uh, as it exists today. And it's got, uh, really everything that you need

08:03.440 --> 08:07.680
to build an agency, no matter what level you're at. Right. So you can have, you know, be a million

08:07.680 --> 08:12.240
dollar run rate, or you could be like at your first day or your first couple of sites or whatever.

08:12.240 --> 08:15.520
And you've got everything you need in-house to grow and build your agency.

08:16.000 --> 08:23.040
So I know that there wasn't like, besides Dave, uh, Dev, Nate, there was, you had at least a couple

08:23.040 --> 08:29.120
hundred people that did this. Yeah, we've had over 300 that used it. And so it was so, it was like

08:29.120 --> 08:33.680
unexpectedly popular. Like it started with just what I was using, like, Hey, this is how I built

08:33.680 --> 08:39.120
my agency. And a buddy of mine, Alex, he, uh, he was like, Hey dude, you should have let other

08:39.120 --> 08:42.800
people try this and see how this works. Cause this works really well. Cause I set it up for him and

08:42.960 --> 08:47.920
worked great for him. And I was like, all right. And so I allowed, you know, really anyone to have

08:47.920 --> 08:52.560
access to it. And a lot of people really liked it, but I also got like consistent feedback. Like

08:52.560 --> 08:57.680
it was more involved to set up phone numbers. People have to set up these, you know, campaigns

08:57.680 --> 09:04.240
and Twilio. And basically I looked at all of the places of version one that people said, Hey,

09:04.240 --> 09:08.720
this part, can we make this better? And then built the version that we have today.

09:09.520 --> 09:14.960
Yep. And like another, another person I know, uh, Mike V used it to scale. Uh, we had Mike V on

09:15.840 --> 09:18.320
a couple of weeks ago. He's just hit $40,000 a month. So,

09:19.440 --> 09:26.080
it was awesome. Uh, but he also set this up for me. It was, it was low cost. It was easy to use.

09:26.080 --> 09:30.560
It was straightforward. And that's what we, we really enjoyed about it. So, um, I gave you co-hosts.

09:30.560 --> 09:37.280
I think what we do is get in there and let's just show the tools that we have today. So,

09:37.280 --> 09:43.040
just show the tool and show some of the things that this is going to streamline.

09:43.040 --> 09:47.520
Some of the things it's going to eliminate and just kind of from a, I mean, there's going to be

09:47.520 --> 09:52.320
a ton of stuff that we're not going to be able to get to, but basically, uh, this is going to be

09:52.320 --> 10:00.160
a CRM, a, a search volume, a due diligence, basically all wrapped into one. That's going

10:00.160 --> 10:05.680
to allow you to a project. I mean, everything all wrapped into one. Yeah, that's it. So the,

10:05.680 --> 10:10.320
the goal is for, not the goal, what we did is to make it an all in one platform

10:11.360 --> 10:16.000
to build scale and automates the tagline, right? So you can get it at rankinronengine.com. We'll

10:16.000 --> 10:21.840
talk more about that at the end of the call, but, uh, that was the point is to make it all in one.

10:21.840 --> 10:27.600
And you can read about it here. If you want to see like a super short seven minute demo, um,

10:27.600 --> 10:32.480
I made one for you to just click on this to see, uh, you know, top to bottom, how it all works,

10:32.480 --> 10:36.640
but I'm going to walk you through it and show you guys, uh, we've already got a bunch of people

10:36.640 --> 10:42.000
that are starting to sign up for it. So pretty excited about, uh, about this. So let's start with,

10:42.000 --> 10:48.240
um, just overview of the platform. I'm going to grab some water. Keep going. Great. Do your thing,

10:48.240 --> 10:51.920
man. Uh, well, I'm just going to give you guys an overview of this platform and I'm going to show

10:51.920 --> 11:00.240
you guys and gals, uh, what the value is for your agencies and why I built this, right? So ultimately

11:00.240 --> 11:04.240
what I found is, is that a lot of people were using all these things in this left column.

11:05.920 --> 11:10.240
There are free tools that were really bad or paid ones that were expensive

11:10.240 --> 11:14.800
or having to use a bunch of paid tools that were expensive. Uh, and it really became like,

11:15.840 --> 11:20.560
I don't know, expensive to, to run, to run an agency. And I noticed this cause I'm big on

11:20.560 --> 11:26.160
running a lean agency and having like the most affordable and high performing way to do every

11:26.160 --> 11:32.000
element of this business model. So, um, I'm going to walk you through this left hand column. Uh,

11:32.000 --> 11:37.840
I think that you guys might be able to, uh, see this. If anyone can't see it, if I need to zoom

11:37.840 --> 11:43.680
in, let me know. I'm going to make it a little bit bigger, but if you guys can't see it, let me know.

11:43.680 --> 11:49.840
So, all right. I'm going to take you through each of these, uh, core features of rake and run engine

11:49.840 --> 11:53.680
and show you how all these work together to build an agency. Right. The first thing is task tracker.

11:54.240 --> 12:00.400
So, um, a lot of people will use things like, uh, Google sheets or notion or, uh,

12:01.440 --> 12:08.960
monday.com or Trello, some of these organizational tools, um, that don't tie into the rest of your

12:08.960 --> 12:16.640
agency. And so, um, I found that in my agency, I've either created or assigned 3000 tasks

12:16.640 --> 12:22.800
to my team. So either ones that I've done or my team has done, and that has consistently moved

12:22.800 --> 12:30.960
the needle forward. So I wanted to integrate that into this platform where you can keep track of

12:30.960 --> 12:36.320
immeasurable, right? Anything in business needs to be measurable. So you're measuring how much

12:36.320 --> 12:41.840
progress that you're making and what needs to be accomplished for your agency and allows you to

12:41.840 --> 12:46.560
scale already with, you know, what's directly in here. So if you want to bring in your team,

12:46.560 --> 12:50.960
you're going to bring in VA's, it's really easy to just, you know, add them as a user to your

12:50.960 --> 12:55.760
company and you can, uh, keep track of that. Right? So there's four categories here. There's

12:55.760 --> 13:00.800
what needs to be done now, what we're working on in progress, what's been done is complete

13:00.800 --> 13:06.080
and what maybe has some kind of blocker, right? This is project management 101 stuff. So, um,

13:06.080 --> 13:12.720
I run a, uh, a hundred million dollar project, uh, for, um, the company that I worked for.

13:12.720 --> 13:18.000
And, um, this is based on those principles, right? Project management principles, right? Because

13:18.000 --> 13:23.040
that's what your business is. You're managing your business and you have got to make sure

13:23.040 --> 13:26.800
that you're, uh, tuned into what's most important to move the needle forward.

13:27.760 --> 13:31.120
So I'm not going to spend a lot of time on this part. Uh, it's pretty straightforward,

13:31.120 --> 13:35.600
right? You put in, you know, your task title, right? So to do more bill events,

13:35.600 --> 13:39.840
my keyboard is super loud. So I'm going to try to type a bunch, put in details here about

13:39.840 --> 13:45.280
whatever that task is, uh, set priority levels, uh, you know, you can add your labels.

13:45.280 --> 13:52.640
So, you know, what's involved to do bill events. Yeah. Uh, that you can add different options down

13:52.640 --> 14:00.000
here, right? So we want to put new bill events and add it. There it is. Add it in, uh, task owner.

14:00.000 --> 14:06.720
You can decide yourself or your team. Uh, so here I'm assigning it to me and then, uh, everything

14:06.720 --> 14:11.680
matters about due dates. So we're going to do this on Halloween. And then you can all color code it

14:12.080 --> 14:16.480
because I'm a nerd like that, right? So when we create this, you can, you know,

14:16.480 --> 14:21.760
add images and all that kind of stuff. It's not, let me click, hold on and make this a little bit

14:21.760 --> 14:34.400
smaller. Oh, task details is required. Um, test. Okay. And so you will begin to fill this up with

14:34.400 --> 14:39.200
what's most important for your agency. So you can add images, you can, you know, like tag people,

14:39.200 --> 14:47.840
put in comments. This is mission control. So, uh, I have used this extensively in version 1.0 and

14:47.840 --> 14:53.120
it's been the, the most, uh, valuable thing for me to go back and measure what kind of results

14:53.120 --> 14:56.640
am I getting and where am I putting my attention? Cause where you put your attention is where you're

14:56.640 --> 15:00.400
going to get your results. All right. And that's what task tracker is about something that's a little

15:00.400 --> 15:05.440
bigger. Real quick. Um, just, I think I might've missed this or maybe you covered it already.

15:05.920 --> 15:11.440
Or if my team, I have a VA or whatever, I can assign this task to them.

15:12.160 --> 15:16.080
Totally. So if I go in here and I click edit right now, I'm the only user in here.

15:16.720 --> 15:22.160
Okay. You can assign people here and you can assign the owner and you as the task right now

15:22.160 --> 15:29.040
only shows me, but you could go and you can click on your users and you can add, um, more users in

15:29.040 --> 15:34.560
here. All right. So you want to add more, you want to add your team and, uh, you can add seats

15:34.560 --> 15:43.120
basically. Yeah. So again, where you put your attention is where you can measure your results

15:43.120 --> 15:46.480
and that's what task tracker is about. Right. So pretty straightforward project management stuff.

15:46.480 --> 15:51.040
So now we're getting to like the meat of this. This is a due diligence and we covered this, uh,

15:51.040 --> 15:55.600
over the last week. I'm not going to like deep dive into this. Uh, on last week's call, we showed

15:55.600 --> 15:59.520
this Nick, you think like talk a little bit about this, but not going to the level of detail of

15:59.520 --> 16:04.560
last week or you want to go forward? I definitely think we should talk about this and guys, I think,

16:04.560 --> 16:10.800
um, you know, we've been taught for a long time. I mean, months, we, people have been said, you know,

16:10.800 --> 16:16.800
what's the state, like what's, uh, uh, the search volume that gives us confidence to go into what,

16:16.800 --> 16:22.400
what is the minimum search volume? And we've purposely not necessarily said, well, on this

16:22.400 --> 16:28.480
tool, it's this because we haven't, we don't have any control over Semrash or mangles or anything.

16:28.480 --> 16:34.240
Now we do. And so now we're going to be able to go in and over the next month, as we're also,

16:34.800 --> 16:39.600
you know, playing around with it, putting our agencies, uh, completely on this tool,

16:39.600 --> 16:44.960
we're going to be able to come up with a minimum search volume to say, Hey, if the tool says this,

16:44.960 --> 16:49.840
you can, you know, with 90% confidence, be sure there's going to be enough search volumes. I'm

16:49.840 --> 16:56.160
really excited about that. But any of you guys that are paying for Semrash and, uh, then you're

16:56.160 --> 17:01.040
paying for that tool and this tool and whatever this right here is going to do everything that

17:01.040 --> 17:10.240
you need. If it's just for this feature alone, like I realized I was paying 120 is $129 or $119

17:10.240 --> 17:16.240
for Semrash. I still haven't figured out, is it SCM rush or is it Semrash? I I've gone back and

17:16.240 --> 17:21.680
forth. I don't even know what the proper term is, whatever it is. Only thing I use that tool for

17:22.640 --> 17:28.960
is search volume. Like from the beginning, I've probably spent a hundred bucks a month, I spent

17:28.960 --> 17:33.840
let's just call it a thousand bucks a year, which is less than it is for, I probably spent five to

17:33.840 --> 17:40.960
$10,000 on the search function of Semrash. And that is this one piece of this tool.

17:41.600 --> 17:44.640
What am I going to talk about real quick, or I would cover it a little bit, but tell them how

17:45.280 --> 17:50.640
this data is, it doesn't go through any third parties. It comes directly into this tool.

17:52.560 --> 17:58.160
Yeah, absolutely. So, um, you're looking at due diligence records here. So, uh, you know, we'll

17:58.160 --> 18:04.000
dive into this and how we get this data, but I realized that there's such a variance in what

18:04.000 --> 18:09.760
data is out there. At the end of the day, uh, you gotta have the most accurate data to make decisions

18:09.760 --> 18:15.520
about which markets to enter. So this is a due diligence tool that automates this process,

18:15.520 --> 18:21.280
right? Where you will put in the essential information that you need to understand your

18:21.280 --> 18:27.520
market. And then you're going to get it spit back out, you know, what exactly the keyword,

18:28.880 --> 18:33.280
search volume, cost per click, and then your competitor analysis looks like.

18:34.240 --> 18:39.520
So, um, speeds up the due diligence process tremendously. Uh, you can pretty quickly

18:39.520 --> 18:44.000
assess if you've got a good market to go into, um, because it's also going to pull in population.

18:44.000 --> 18:50.400
So, um, I looked at like where this data comes from and what the most accurate data is. So this

18:50.400 --> 18:55.200
is being pulled straight out of a keyword planner where I'm getting it straight from the source.

18:55.200 --> 18:59.680
This is coming straight from Google. And so Google is saying, Hey, this is what the search

18:59.760 --> 19:05.520
volume is. This is what the cost per click is. And if you're not getting, you know, uh, a return,

19:05.520 --> 19:10.240
it's basically Google saying, we don't know. We can't tell you. So one of my frustrations was

19:10.240 --> 19:14.560
some of these other tools like main goals or whatever, um, would give a number for that,

19:14.560 --> 19:18.160
but it was a guess. And when I would run ads, it would be like very wrong.

19:19.040 --> 19:25.840
And so, um, having this pulled in with my due diligence into the same records, uh, for competitor

19:25.840 --> 19:30.320
analysis, you know, really allowed me to see what a picture, a snapshot of that market looks

19:30.320 --> 19:36.400
like. Um, so let's do an example. Um, Hey, real quick, Ryan, before we go any further,

19:36.400 --> 19:41.200
just a quick question from Gina. She said, can you add attachments or documents to the task?

19:42.080 --> 19:50.640
Yeah, sure can. So, um, you can upload files. Amazing. Yeah. So you can just add,

19:50.640 --> 19:57.040
yeah, um, uh, like a PDF or something like that. You could add to it. That's awesome.

19:57.040 --> 20:02.000
You have images, logos, whatever you'd add. Yeah. Beautiful. And then real quick, one more thing,

20:02.000 --> 20:06.640
just so we're keeping on top of these, Daniel Kelly says, so does rank and rent engine do away

20:06.640 --> 20:11.600
with the need to have multiple subscriptions? Answer is yes. Assuming that he's talking about

20:12.800 --> 20:18.240
having man goals and SEM rush and these things. This is the old guys, the only tool you need to

20:18.240 --> 20:21.840
scale. That's why I call it that live. That's called the live this, but anyway,

20:21.840 --> 20:28.000
I think that's what he's asking. Um, yeah. Absolutely. That's the, that's how we built it.

20:28.000 --> 20:32.240
This is the, this is the definitive tool that you need for this industry, right? So for local lead

20:32.240 --> 20:37.680
generation, you don't need anything else to grow. Now you may have some like, you know, something

20:37.680 --> 20:42.000
that you do with Adobe Photoshop for your editor images or whatever. It didn't have stuff like that,

20:42.000 --> 20:47.120
but like the essentials from local lead generation are here. This is everything you need.

20:47.120 --> 20:49.840
Beautiful. Okay. Sorry to cut you off. I just want to stay on top of that.

20:51.040 --> 20:57.120
So, but real quick, I just want to say on this guys, this is this again, the cool part about

20:57.120 --> 21:01.360
this from what everything that I've seen so far is each one of these, like for example,

21:01.360 --> 21:08.240
task tracker. I remember at one point in my career, I paid for a program or a software

21:08.240 --> 21:14.480
called pipe drive, right? All pipe drive does is exactly what task track tracker does, which is,

21:15.040 --> 21:19.520
I mean, it does it for your clients or whatever, which we're going to show you that this also does,

21:19.520 --> 21:24.480
but basically you just create these cards and you drag them. That's basically all that it did. And

21:24.480 --> 21:29.360
I was, I think it was like 50 bucks a month. And that's what task trackers now due diligence.

21:29.360 --> 21:33.760
I don't know about you guys, but I was one of those people in the beginning. I had stacks. I

21:33.760 --> 21:38.320
used to print off the due diligence. I would print off like 50 at a time, keep them on my desk.

21:38.320 --> 21:42.720
I'd take a pen and I was writing the information that I had stacks of these

21:42.720 --> 21:47.200
hundreds of these due diligence sheets. And then I thought I graduated and I was so smart and I

21:47.200 --> 21:53.040
went to Google drive. And now I have so many, and I've got, you know, folder inside a folder,

21:53.040 --> 21:59.280
inside a folder, inside a folder, inside a folder to get to, you know, and I've got it by niche and

21:59.280 --> 22:04.880
all this different stuff. Whereas this now I can log into my tool. I have my tasks and I have my

22:04.880 --> 22:10.160
search volume and I have my due diligence cards. And I think I asked this last time, is there a

22:10.160 --> 22:12.320
limit to how many of these due diligence you can have?

22:14.320 --> 22:17.600
Yeah. You've got to map out your empire, right? You've got to map out where you're going to put

22:17.600 --> 22:21.280
your, your sites. So it's unlimited. Right.

22:21.280 --> 22:28.480
And one other thing I like a lot who here has done the research on, let's say Las Vegas concrete.

22:29.040 --> 22:33.200
It doesn't look good or it does look good or whatever. You decide not to do it. And then like

22:33.200 --> 22:38.400
six months later, you're like, Oh, I should go into Las Vegas concrete or somebody hits you up

22:38.400 --> 22:41.920
and says, you know, you get a referral or whatever. And you're like, I remember doing

22:41.920 --> 22:46.240
the due diligence and you go back and you're like, Oh, I should probably do it again to see

22:46.240 --> 22:51.360
if it's like up to date. Guess what? All you have to do now is push one button.

22:51.920 --> 22:59.040
You go to it, you push refetch, correct? And it automatically runs the entire due diligence

22:59.040 --> 23:02.080
right within, what is it? Two and a half seconds, three seconds.

23:02.080 --> 23:06.640
It's pretty much instant. So you can refetch it or you can go in here and here's a, here's one for

23:06.720 --> 23:11.120
Brick Masonry in Nashville. Click edit. If you want to switch out your keywords, right? Like maybe

23:11.120 --> 23:18.560
we don't like retaining wall, but we like, you know, brick wall. I don't know. I'm just

23:18.560 --> 23:23.600
going to make up something. And we want to update our keyword because we found that maybe it's

23:23.600 --> 23:27.920
successful in other markets, right? We just go in here and we just update the location and it's

23:27.920 --> 23:33.040
going to refetch that data. So brick wall is a tool. Actually it's not a bad keyword, 140

23:33.040 --> 23:36.960
search volume. I don't know what the cost per click is, but you just edit that record and it

23:36.960 --> 23:42.800
pulls in the latest competitor data as well, right? So their domain age, authority, backlinks,

23:42.800 --> 23:47.680
page authority, citation flow, and trust flow. And it'll refresh all that for you where, you know,

23:47.680 --> 23:52.320
if you're kind of waiting, kind of eyeing it, right? Maybe, you know, your work sure, like your

23:52.320 --> 23:56.880
market was marked to be determined up here. And you're like, all right, I got to look at Masonry

23:56.880 --> 23:59.840
in Nashville. Like, all right, this is pretty good. And you can mark it and go.

24:00.560 --> 24:04.720
Um, let's just do a little math. Let's say you're, how long do you think it takes to do,

24:04.720 --> 24:08.480
take this tool out? Let's say the standard way. How long do you think it takes you to do a due

24:08.480 --> 24:13.040
diligence? I would guess for me, probably about 30 minutes. Yeah, that's probably right. I'll say 30

24:13.040 --> 24:17.440
minutes. Let's say you're average. Let's say you're not making that much money. Your time's worth

24:17.440 --> 24:23.360
$100 an hour, right? So let's say that 50 bucks every time you do one of these, what it costs you.

24:23.360 --> 24:28.800
And let's say that you do, you know, for every area, you have to look at 10. So let's say to do

24:28.800 --> 24:34.480
10 sites, you have to look at 100. So 10 is up by 100. That costs you $5,000 worth of your time

24:35.040 --> 24:40.000
to look at due diligence. You just literally eliminated that with this tool. I mean, it's

24:40.000 --> 24:45.920
insane. It takes you instance three seconds or less to get the same information. It take, it would

24:45.920 --> 24:52.160
take you 30 minutes to get. Yeah. Yeah. Look, I mean, money loves speed, right? You said it a

24:52.160 --> 24:56.240
million times. It's true. The faster that you can do this stuff, the more quickly you can make

24:56.240 --> 25:01.520
accurate decisions to go into a market. Not to mention you might miss something because

25:01.520 --> 25:09.200
you're human and you, you, you know, incorrectly anyway. So of everything, dude, the search volume

25:09.200 --> 25:14.960
and the due diligence, this might be my favorite part of the entire tool, but piece of it.

25:15.520 --> 25:19.440
Yeah. We spent a lot of time on the due diligence part to really make sure this is

25:19.440 --> 25:21.840
going to grab what you need. I see some of these questions in the chat. So

25:22.720 --> 25:28.800
I'll just talk through, when you add a record, this only works in the US for right now. We're

25:28.800 --> 25:33.360
going to expand to other markets outside the US, but you know, your country is the United States.

25:33.360 --> 25:38.800
You pick your state, you put in your city, you put in your niche, call driven, yes or no. That's

25:38.800 --> 25:45.120
just a reminder, like, you know, are we in the right niche? You're putting your primary keywords.

25:45.120 --> 25:49.280
This is your money keyword. Like this is the one, this is masonry, this is artificial grass,

25:49.280 --> 25:53.360
this is concrete contractor, this is fence installation. And then you put up your core

25:53.360 --> 25:58.000
keywords, which are the next six. So those are the ones that you're going to build your service

25:58.000 --> 26:02.720
pages out of when you build service pages. These are, you know, your core keywords and it covers

26:02.720 --> 26:07.360
that and the due diligence modules, right? And then you need to look at how many active

26:07.360 --> 26:11.920
businesses there are. Maybe now you don't know you market TBD and then you put in your top three

26:11.920 --> 26:18.320
competitor domains, right? So I just grabbed some URLs here. These are just kind of ones I, you know,

26:18.320 --> 26:24.720
put in and you're going to put in these domains. You can put in an available domain. So this is

26:24.720 --> 26:30.000
grayed out right now because I've already added it. But you'll put, you'll put in this big brick

26:30.000 --> 26:35.280
energy Nashville for a brick mason, but you can, you know, edit whatever your domain is that,

26:35.280 --> 26:40.400
you know, you check GoDaddy for to make sure you could buy the domain. Loading fruit, TBD,

26:40.400 --> 26:44.960
go or no go TBD, or maybe you already have a vibe for it and then you update the location,

26:44.960 --> 26:49.600
right? And it's going to pull in that data automatically. So you can see that it just

26:49.600 --> 26:53.680
loaded while we've been talking here, right? So all that data that you normally have to go

26:54.320 --> 26:58.560
type in domain age, like pull up domain authority, like how many backlinks, right? Like

26:58.560 --> 27:02.160
that is completely unnecessary. That's one of the things that frustrate me most is

27:02.720 --> 27:06.960
you just can make it the right API calls to the right services and you're going to get

27:07.600 --> 27:13.360
the data that you need. Yep. Beautiful. So let's just rapid fire through some of these questions

27:13.360 --> 27:20.080
because I know we're going to be just cutting it close here. So real quick, Richard said,

27:20.080 --> 27:25.360
I'm doing my business with my spouse. So can I assign a task to both of us

27:25.360 --> 27:31.760
or can she edit a task without being an admin? Yeah. So there's one company admin. So under users,

27:32.800 --> 27:41.200
there's the one admin, you can add someone as a seat on there who is, you know, an administrator,

27:41.200 --> 27:45.520
or you can both use the same account, you know, with the same password. If you want equal admin,

27:45.520 --> 27:51.360
right? So I don't know how you feel about that, but the invited users will appear here. So if you

27:51.360 --> 27:58.480
want to add somebody in, you can both be on the task. So this task here, you can assign, you can

27:58.480 --> 28:03.200
have, you know, the owner, you can have the person that's assigned to it and all that is going to

28:03.200 --> 28:08.480
appear just like RRB, right? There's my initials, Ryan Dalton. You would see here on the task who

28:08.480 --> 28:13.600
it belongs to. Beautiful. So it's designed for collaborative, you know, working together, right?

28:14.240 --> 28:17.360
Beautiful. Okay. So answer that one is yes.

28:20.640 --> 28:25.360
Prabh says, just hopping off, can we use this for SEO? Of course you can use this for SEO.

28:27.200 --> 28:30.800
LeadGen is SEO. We're just doing LeadGen. We're just doing SEO for ourselves, right?

28:32.560 --> 28:37.360
Richard says, is it pulling the competitor data on its own without entering that information?

28:38.560 --> 28:43.200
So I think your question is, is it pulling your top three by just virtually knowing what the market

28:43.200 --> 28:47.120
is? And the answer is no, you have to go in and you have to look at what your top three are, right?

28:47.120 --> 28:52.160
Because, you know, you've got to go see what those top three websites are for the ones that you want

28:52.160 --> 28:57.120
to beat. But all you have to do is paste the URL in here. So which is a good thing, by the way,

28:57.120 --> 29:01.440
because if not, maybe it would pull in like a home advisor and stuff like that. And we all know that

29:01.440 --> 29:05.760
home advisor, even though they may be your spot number one, they're not the same type of a

29:05.760 --> 29:11.360
competition as a local competitor, because Google likes to give the spot to the local. So yeah,

29:11.360 --> 29:15.280
you're going to go in, you're going to just choose those three, the ones that you keep seeing over

29:15.280 --> 29:19.840
and over, and boom, then you're going to have that information. So it's going to take you just a

29:19.840 --> 29:26.240
second. Bo asks the same question, how is it picking the top three competitors? So that's one,

29:26.240 --> 29:32.880
you're going to put in the top three competitors. Again, we can't, unless we had a formula that said,

29:32.960 --> 29:36.880
get rid of home advisor, do this, do this. There's no way that we could do that, because it would

29:36.880 --> 29:42.080
just be pulling the top three. And sometimes that would be the home advisor or Angie's list, which

29:42.080 --> 29:46.240
in which case it wouldn't be accurate. So that you do put in the top three competitors.

29:46.240 --> 29:50.560
Yeah. Yeah. There's limits to good software and automation. Like the best way to do it is to have

29:50.560 --> 29:55.200
a human in the loop, right? You want to have a human that is looking at that data and saying like,

29:55.200 --> 29:59.040
yeah, these are the top three, you plug those in and then everything else is done automatically

29:59.040 --> 30:04.160
for you after that. Okay. Beautiful. I agree. Gina says, I have stuff scattered everywhere.

30:04.160 --> 30:09.440
This is amazing. I a hundred percent agree with you. And then Bruce has said to this DD tool,

30:09.440 --> 30:13.040
find your top competitors. Well, no, that's, we covered that as well. Okay. Last one, Daniel

30:13.040 --> 30:17.200
Kelly says, not related to ranking or Angie, but would appreciate some input on choosing a niche.

30:17.200 --> 30:20.720
I joined last week. I spent a while looking at a tree service, but it seems almost impossible to

30:20.720 --> 30:26.720
rank for an ultra competitive. So I'd appreciate some ones Nick would recommend. Okay. I'll comment

30:26.720 --> 30:29.840
with some of the recommended ones. So we don't have to stop on that one. Daniel, just give me a

30:29.840 --> 30:37.840
second. I'll respond there. And then Kirk says, perhaps it could screen out. Yeah, it could. But

30:37.840 --> 30:42.080
again, as Ryan said, I think having a human in the loop is the best option, but it's not something

30:42.080 --> 30:47.200
that we can't update going forward. And then Raphael says, do I still need to use Google

30:47.200 --> 30:53.440
keyword planner for ads? No, you don't. So we can jump around here. We don't have to go in order.

30:54.160 --> 30:59.280
Uh, so I'm sure you keyword planner. So here's keyword planner. Uh, we're just going to do old

30:59.280 --> 31:03.920
faithful. Let's do concrete. It's a contractor. By the way, let me point something out quick,

31:03.920 --> 31:08.480
quick, quick. Um, everyone thinks concrete saturated literally yesterday when I was on

31:08.480 --> 31:12.640
the call, uh, with, I was going to call it Jason. He had to hop off. Jason already had to hop off,

31:12.640 --> 31:17.680
get on a closing call. He got on like 15 minutes later, 30 minutes later, and he closed a $1,400

31:17.680 --> 31:22.160
a month deal in concrete. There are deals out there. I'm not saying that you should go into

31:22.160 --> 31:28.400
concrete, but if you look hard enough, there's still deals. So, um, yeah, use old faithful for

31:28.400 --> 31:33.520
us. Yeah, we, we can, we can switch up. We do, uh, we'll do Mason. Let's do a fresh one. Right. So,

31:33.520 --> 31:38.960
um, I still get deals in concrete. Uh, we're we'll have a closing call this week for concrete. So,

31:38.960 --> 31:42.400
uh, I don't think it's, well, let's, let's do another one. Let's do, uh, let's do Mason. Right.

31:42.400 --> 31:48.640
So this data is your keyword planner, right? So think about how much time is lost hopping

31:48.640 --> 31:52.640
between all these platforms. You're not only paying for them, but you're jumping between them

31:52.640 --> 31:59.520
back and forth and it's, it's slowing you down. So, um, this is something that I felt very acutely.

31:59.520 --> 32:04.720
I don't want to have to always be jumping back and forth. You also have data fidelity issues when

32:04.720 --> 32:08.160
that happens, right? Like, am I making sure that I'm putting the right data in? Is my team putting

32:08.160 --> 32:15.280
the right data in? This is pulling straight from the source. This is pure keyword and, uh,

32:15.440 --> 32:21.600
calls per click and search volume data. So, uh, we did Masonry, Nashville area, search volume,

32:22.160 --> 32:28.720
calls per click. You can see the PPC competition level, right? So, um, the, you know, low, uh,

32:28.720 --> 32:34.400
and then the competition is just shown here as low, right? So, um, it also pulls your low, uh,

32:34.400 --> 32:39.840
top of page bid and your high top of page bid to see what it's going to cost you to get at the top

32:39.840 --> 32:45.360
of the page. Uh, and then you're obviously your average monthly search volume, uh, over the course

32:45.360 --> 32:52.560
of the last year. And then related keywords, right? So all the Mesa Green near me, um, if it

32:52.560 --> 32:57.200
doesn't have the data for that, it's not going to make up a number. This, again, this is what

32:57.200 --> 33:01.440
frustrated me about some of these other tools is it will make up a number based on, you know,

33:01.440 --> 33:05.600
whatever data brokers are pulling from, because that's what these keyword planners do is they go

33:05.600 --> 33:12.800
buy data from, from places. And, um, I found this to be pretty unreliable. I want as accurate as I

33:12.800 --> 33:18.640
can get. And if Google doesn't know, like, I need to know that, right? So, uh, this is a great

33:18.640 --> 33:23.200
example of the, like, you know, you put in that core keyword, this is my primary keyword and,

33:23.200 --> 33:28.400
you know, I'm going to get that, that search data to pull up. Beautiful. So I'm just looking at

33:28.400 --> 33:33.600
comments. Uh, Mike V is a tool limited to the United States. Obviously not all the features,

33:33.600 --> 33:41.200
but some of the, uh, the competitor analysis features, that kind of stuff. Um, of course that,

33:41.200 --> 33:48.640
that's, this is just beta. So we're going to be working on that, but yes, it is. Um, Aaron Smith

33:48.640 --> 33:51.920
said, I joined a bit late. How do we access this tool? We're going to be getting to that here in

33:51.920 --> 33:57.840
just a moment in the next 15 minutes. So hold on one second on that. And Richard said, is there

33:57.840 --> 34:03.280
a way to save previous keyword planner searches? Oh, that's a great idea. Yeah. So I've been talking

34:03.280 --> 34:07.600
to the developers about that. What we'd like to do is have a keyword search history where you can

34:07.600 --> 34:11.520
just select if you want to go back and look at that, that doesn't exist now, but you guys,

34:11.520 --> 34:16.720
this community drives the development of this tool. This is made by people doing rank and rent

34:16.720 --> 34:22.320
for people doing rank and rent. So, you know, as you guys are using this tool, I've got a,

34:22.320 --> 34:27.760
you know, up here in this corner, I've got a support button that you can click and you can say,

34:27.840 --> 34:32.240
hey, I've got this idea. Hey, why don't we do this? I'm going to take what the,

34:32.240 --> 34:37.200
what the people want and build it. Right. So things like that, that we continually,

34:37.920 --> 34:42.320
we'll make this the best in class tool for this industry. And, uh, you know, you guys are,

34:42.320 --> 34:49.120
are the ones that are informing that. Beautiful. What else should we cover? We have time to cover

34:49.120 --> 34:54.080
like, what else do you want to cover, man? We have programmable. So I want to talk about the

34:54.080 --> 34:58.560
biggest thing that you need for retention in this industry. And so let me tell you in 30 seconds,

34:58.560 --> 35:04.400
how I know this. I will also, in my agency, close sites for site owners. And one of the things that

35:04.400 --> 35:08.800
I coach the site owners who bring sites to me, they want to get them closed and on a profit

35:08.800 --> 35:14.480
split. Basically I'll say, Hey, you need to have a text message SMS notification set up in your

35:14.480 --> 35:20.080
programmable voice so that the business owner knows that you're getting those leads over to them,

35:20.080 --> 35:23.760
right? Where every time a call comes in, they get a text message that says you have a new

35:23.760 --> 35:29.440
lead from, and it shows the number. So what I've done is, um, when you guys get a number here,

35:29.440 --> 35:34.640
your first ones are included for free with your subscription. This has a full suite of programmable

35:34.640 --> 35:39.120
voice and messaging. So you can go in here and you can, you know, pull up this number and this

35:39.120 --> 35:42.720
one is for a little rock concrete, right? That exists. It's not a real site. I'm sure it's a

35:42.720 --> 35:47.680
real site for someone under that domain, but I just put some information in here. Um, and so you

35:47.680 --> 35:52.800
could put in your, you know, all this information in here, right? So you can put in your tracking

35:52.800 --> 35:58.480
number. You're, um, uh, pulled in automatically. You can put in your forwarding number and then

35:58.480 --> 36:04.160
down here, all of this stuff right here is about retention. So, um, when the call comes in, you

36:04.160 --> 36:09.600
want to be able to enable spam filtering or not. So one of the key complaints that business owners

36:09.600 --> 36:14.560
give is about spam. And they're like, Hey, I get great leads, but I've got this spam coming in.

36:14.560 --> 36:20.320
All you got to do is enable spam filtering. And now when someone calls, they press, uh, one to

36:20.400 --> 36:26.160
connect to the business owner, right? They hear a message that says something like, um, press,

36:26.160 --> 36:30.560
thank you for calling, uh, press one to be connected to one of our team. And the call will

36:30.560 --> 36:36.400
actually not go through until someone presses that input. So it saves you with one click, uh,

36:36.400 --> 36:42.640
spam concerns from your business owners. Um, you can choose your whisper message, male or female.

36:42.640 --> 36:47.840
It's also got state law compliance for call recordings. So, uh, you can click this right

36:47.840 --> 36:52.080
here to play it and listen to it if you want to. But basically it's just that message that says

36:52.080 --> 36:55.600
this call may be monitored or recorded for quality assurance or training purposes, which is,

36:56.160 --> 37:02.400
um, required by state law. If you do two party, uh, call recordings or one party call recording

37:02.400 --> 37:06.800
or other, right? So not true for every state, but it's true in a lot of states. And so I just leave

37:06.800 --> 37:11.760
it on by default to be compliant. Um, and then you can put in your whisper messages here, right? So

37:11.760 --> 37:16.320
you can do, uh, there's a default one that says, Hey, you have a new call generated from Little Rock

37:16.320 --> 37:21.520
Concrete, or you can do a custom one. If you want to like, Hey, Nick, uh, you have a call from

37:21.520 --> 37:26.320
Little Rock Concrete, like put in my business owner's name there. Uh, do you ask, does this

37:26.320 --> 37:31.760
take place a call rail? Yes. You can put in, uh, you, your numbers that exist now already,

37:31.760 --> 37:38.480
if you want to, or excuse me, or you can, uh, get new numbers through program of voice SMS.

37:39.120 --> 37:48.160
So let's say I have a call rail account. What I is there's a way to like bring all my numbers in and

37:48.160 --> 37:54.320
then get rid of my call rail account. Yeah. So we're going to do a number of, uh, porting, uh,

37:54.320 --> 37:58.720
in the future, right? We don't have porting set up, but what you can do is you can keep that number

37:58.720 --> 38:03.440
there. You don't have to buy numbers here. Uh, your numbers are included with your subscription

38:03.680 --> 38:08.160
up to a certain amount. Um, and then, uh, you can just add in your numbers here into your

38:08.160 --> 38:11.920
sites, into your site portfolio, right? Where you just type in what the number is instead of

38:11.920 --> 38:16.640
add a new one. So you keep that for now, your existing sites, you'd keep your call rail account

38:16.640 --> 38:21.280
and keep those numbers and, uh, and then you're, but going forward, new numbers,

38:21.280 --> 38:26.400
you could buy directly through this, through Twilio. And then once we, uh, add porting as

38:26.400 --> 38:30.960
part of, as one of the new features, then, um, you can go ahead and, and we could get rid of that.

38:31.680 --> 38:37.440
Absolutely. Yep. Yep. Um, and the cool thing about these numbers is on the backend,

38:37.440 --> 38:41.760
they have got a feature that I love is that you can do, if you do Google business profile

38:41.760 --> 38:47.120
verifications, you can do those through, uh, these numbers, through, uh, the call,

38:47.120 --> 38:53.280
whereas call rail blocks that. It doesn't let you do it. So, uh, pretty neat little, um, difference

38:53.280 --> 38:58.880
there. Here's the real moneymaker for me. I would not even do local lead generation if not for what

38:58.880 --> 39:02.720
I'm about to show you guys. Like I would not do it. It would be too frustrating for me.

39:02.720 --> 39:08.880
And that is SMS notifications. So, um, when the call comes in by default, this is enabled.

39:08.880 --> 39:12.880
It's going to show you have a new lead from, and then it shows the site name automatically

39:12.880 --> 39:17.680
pulled in and then the caller's number. And so that business owner, every time they get a call,

39:18.480 --> 39:23.280
uh, it says you have a new lead from, and it shows that, that phone number. And so it keeps you

39:24.000 --> 39:28.720
top of their mind. They are thinking like, okay, I'm getting these leads. They're still coming in.

39:28.880 --> 39:33.360
We've already blocked out the spam because we turned on spam filtering and they're getting

39:33.360 --> 39:39.360
this text message. And every time that they get that new lead coming in, they're seeing the value

39:39.360 --> 39:44.240
of your service. So this has been like the number one most valuable thing for me in my agency.

39:44.240 --> 39:49.040
I've baked it into a rank and run engine. So just from the jump, you've got access to it.

39:50.160 --> 39:57.040
I love that. That's it's so valuable because it, um, you like, even if you, even if it's only 10

39:57.040 --> 40:02.720
leads or 15 leads or whatever, just constantly reminding them, you know, that you're there,

40:02.720 --> 40:06.640
Hey, you know, it's like, you're poking them and say, Hey dude, that's me. That's me. That's me.

40:06.640 --> 40:12.240
Cause a lot of times these business owners, even though it's coming from you, they want to assume

40:12.240 --> 40:17.840
it's from their own stupid little go daddy site. And, and they would do everything to be like,

40:17.840 --> 40:22.480
Oh, I don't think so. I don't think so. Right. This is going to show them that like, this does,

40:22.480 --> 40:27.440
this does indeed come from you. So this is a great retention tool. And for those of us that

40:27.440 --> 40:32.720
have done nothing for retention and still retained people, imagine this is just going to be one more,

40:33.600 --> 40:39.280
you know, a nail in the coffin to keep these people just locked in with us. So, um, and by

40:39.280 --> 40:45.040
the way, uh, did you enable that or is that default? By default, they have this, you could

40:45.040 --> 40:51.040
customize it and change it, right. You put in, you know, a name or whatever, right. But by default,

40:51.040 --> 40:55.360
they get an SMS lead notification. I could see really buttering up the business owner and be

40:55.360 --> 41:02.080
like, hello, boss. Uh, here's a little call. Yeah. Something like that. Anyway. Yeah, man.

41:04.000 --> 41:09.760
Yeah. So, uh, you get all your tracking numbers in here. You can get a new one straight through

41:09.760 --> 41:13.920
the platform, right? So, you know, if you want to get, you know, your, your new tracking number,

41:13.920 --> 41:18.240
you can get it, configure it just like I showed you guys a second ago. Right now it's just the

41:18.240 --> 41:22.080
U S my idea. Love you, man. Sorry. It's not there for New Zealand yet, but we'll get you hooked up.

41:22.960 --> 41:27.520
Um, and then you'll, uh, be able to get those numbers, but, uh, right now it's just the U S

41:27.520 --> 41:32.640
but it's, it's, you know, it's everywhere in the U S so, uh, you can get those numbers and you can

41:32.640 --> 41:38.800
see your first ones are included for free on your account. Beautiful. How many, how many are included

41:38.800 --> 41:46.080
for free? Uh, your first five on your, if you do ignition, if you do full throttle, sorry, ignition,

41:46.080 --> 41:51.040
it's five turbo charges, 20 in full throttle. It's 50. Those are the three different levels.

41:51.040 --> 41:55.680
Okay. Beautiful. And then you can, you can add your own, uh, as well, right? So you can do add

41:55.680 --> 42:05.040
on numbers, uh, very affordably. So, uh, let's co can we cover one more, one more, uh, feature

42:05.040 --> 42:09.920
and then we can do a few questions and we can, uh, let anyone, we can share the beta information

42:09.920 --> 42:13.840
that want the people that want to, uh, get on the beta for a discount.

42:14.560 --> 42:18.640
For sure. Yeah. So, uh, we're going to cover this last one here, but, you know,

42:18.640 --> 42:22.560
I'm just going to run through these. You can do site portfolio. All your sites are in one spot,

42:23.040 --> 42:28.160
uh, put in all your sites, prospects, put in all your prospects, clients, all your clients show

42:28.160 --> 42:32.800
up here, right? You can put in the service type SEO lead generation paid advertising,

42:32.800 --> 42:38.320
your subscription type, et cetera, uh, put in all your leads. You can check all your leads here,

42:38.320 --> 42:42.560
and then you can see all your calls and the recordings. But the one I'll show you guys is

42:44.160 --> 42:52.560
this one. Uh, this is site analyzer. So this will allow you to go in and look at the performance of

42:52.560 --> 42:58.160
your own sites or look at your competition sites. So I put in, you know, one of my Legion sites here

42:58.160 --> 43:02.320
and, you know, you can see all the essential metrics at these cards, the top citation flow,

43:02.320 --> 43:06.560
trust flow, domain authority, page authority. Are you improving at these metrics over time

43:06.560 --> 43:11.440
to outrank your competition? Um, you can see your backlink profile, right? Like how many are you

43:11.440 --> 43:18.560
gaining the last 12 months? Uh, how many of you gained a loss over the last 12 months, right? Uh,

43:18.560 --> 43:22.720
here, this gets a little bit technical. I'll probably don't have time for all this, but

43:22.720 --> 43:28.080
gets into your referring IPs, your referring subnet nets and your external backlinks, and then, uh,

43:28.080 --> 43:34.000
your top referring domains, which you want some diversity on. So, uh, referring domains, uh,

43:34.000 --> 43:37.760
all times showing all the, the top ones where you're getting backlinks from basically and what,

43:37.840 --> 43:42.880
their trust flow and citation flow looks like. And then your anchor texts, right? Like how much

43:42.880 --> 43:47.360
anchor text diversity do you have and, uh, what kind of referring domains, all the essential

43:47.360 --> 43:52.720
information that you need that will give you an insight into the performance of your own

43:52.720 --> 43:57.920
lead generation site. And, you know, you can put in competitors too, right? So you can do your own

43:57.920 --> 44:04.240
or you can do another one, but, um, all that data gets piped into this, this one, uh, dashboard for

44:04.240 --> 44:09.920
you. Is it safe? You analyze it and then does it just read, when you put the new one, it doesn't

44:09.920 --> 44:14.960
get rid of this. Is it just like a standing tool or does it save past searches? Yeah, it'll put

44:14.960 --> 44:24.560
a new one in. So let's do, uh, oh, I didn't do that commonplace. Um, this is for like, uh,

44:24.560 --> 44:28.560
assessing a site at a time. If you want to do a due diligence record, you could pull that in

44:28.560 --> 44:34.000
for due diligence, right? So if I go back, it's just gonna, it's gonna refresh it. Um, but we'll

44:34.000 --> 44:39.520
add a, um, search history, like, uh, you know, here's the ones that you've done, the results

44:39.520 --> 44:44.400
that they got. So we'll add that in the future. Yeah. Beautiful. Okay. I think that's something

44:44.400 --> 44:52.720
we should add. I think it'd be nice. Concrete. One thing I want to mention guys is you can finish,

44:52.720 --> 44:59.920
you can finish this. Let me, so each one of these tabs is basically replacing a software tool,

44:59.920 --> 45:06.560
right? Like that's how, like I was just looking at it. Task tracker. Um, we, I mean, we've used all

45:06.560 --> 45:12.640
kinds of different stuff. I told you, we used to use, uh, like, what's this? There's notion,

45:12.640 --> 45:19.200
right? We use notion for task tracker, then the due diligence. We used Google sheets and we used

45:19.200 --> 45:25.920
SEMrush and then the site portfolio. We would use, uh, we used everything from Asana

45:26.560 --> 45:33.360
to Google sheets to pipe. Like I don't know what else we use. We said that was prospect pipeline.

45:33.360 --> 45:41.760
I used pipe drive client list. We use Entraport, like lead tracker, call rail. It's like every

45:41.760 --> 45:46.160
single one of these I was paying or using a different tool. Even if I wasn't paying,

45:46.160 --> 45:51.520
I had to go and toggle between all these tabs. And now each one of these little tabs on the

45:51.520 --> 45:55.760
left here is replacing a piece of software, putting it into one place that you can just,

45:55.760 --> 45:59.120
you know, scale your entire agency from, which is incredible. Money loves speed.

46:00.640 --> 46:04.240
That's the goal, man. Put it all in one spot. It doesn't need to be in 10 different places.

46:04.240 --> 46:08.720
It just creates inefficiencies. Here's the most important part. Can I put my own profile picture

46:08.720 --> 46:17.840
in the corner? For somebody like me, that's real. You can put it in the goofy avatars, right?

46:20.560 --> 46:24.560
Okay. But you can actually upload a picture. Yeah, you can upload your picture.

46:24.560 --> 46:28.160
Amazing. Obviously guys, that's not the most important thing, but I thought it's kind of a

46:28.160 --> 46:33.280
nice little touch. Okay. So let me look at this really quick. We have a few minutes. I'm super

46:33.360 --> 46:38.240
pumped to get my team in playing with it, me getting in playing with it.

46:40.160 --> 46:44.880
Let's just do a couple of questions. Then we're going to share the information on the beta. Okay.

46:46.400 --> 46:53.840
So let's see. Man, we got so many questions. Let me start at the bottom, actually.

46:53.840 --> 46:57.120
Jahil says, I joined late, but I have a question about the site portfolio section. Is there some

46:57.120 --> 47:02.560
type of filtering system where we can split sites we have rented from the sites we don't have rented?

47:02.560 --> 47:11.200
Yeah, for sure. So you could show ones that are in development, right? And those are basically

47:11.200 --> 47:14.960
unlimited, right? You could put just tons of in-development ones in there. And then when

47:15.760 --> 47:22.320
the development status is complete, you could put a market is complete and then edit whatever

47:22.320 --> 47:26.720
details you need to in here, right? So you can do your service type by lead generation, SEO,

47:26.720 --> 47:31.040
paid advertising, whatever your site is, and then indicate whether you actually have a client on it.

47:31.040 --> 47:35.680
So under your client list, you can tie it to a website, right? So that website will be assigned

47:35.680 --> 47:42.320
to a client and then they'll know if it's rented. Beautiful. Okay. Jeremy says, hey Ryan, congrats

47:42.320 --> 47:46.480
on building such a promising tool. It looks really great. Sorry if they've already been asked. I'm on

47:46.480 --> 47:49.920
the job. So you got a couple of questions. Let's rapid fire. And I know some of the answers,

47:49.920 --> 47:56.480
so I'll answer them. Can we bring in our own Twilio numbers, bring your own key style or

47:56.480 --> 48:01.120
must we purchase them in rare? They'll eventually be able to be ported in. In the meantime,

48:01.120 --> 48:04.720
what you can do is you can, when you create a site, you can just put in the phone number,

48:06.080 --> 48:09.200
the number you like to tracking number, or you can just add your own.

48:10.240 --> 48:14.160
Perfect. Number two, he says, if not, can we pour our tracking numbers in out of rare?

48:14.160 --> 48:17.920
Not yet, but that is, that has been asked a couple of times. So that's going to be at the top of what

48:17.920 --> 48:24.400
we want to, we want to update the next update. Okay. Does it have a web browser dialer in it

48:24.400 --> 48:29.360
so we can call the leads via the website tracking number? I don't think so right now.

48:30.000 --> 48:37.200
No. Okay. And again, guys, as it's crazy, because as you guys are asking these questions, it's,

48:37.200 --> 48:44.800
it would be really impossible to cover like from, remember this is version like, you know, 1.0,

48:44.800 --> 48:50.800
it's a version 2.0 of rare, but this is version 1.0 of this being an actual tool. And I think

48:50.800 --> 48:55.200
you've covered basically everything. So of course, there's going to be these little teeny

48:55.200 --> 48:59.440
things that are nice, whatever, but just keep in mind, there are going to be a lot of updates

48:59.440 --> 49:04.320
coming. This is just where we're starting at. Okay. One more question. He asks, he said, I see

49:04.320 --> 49:07.520
on your website, it says you only support USA number at this time. Do you have an estimated

49:07.520 --> 49:12.880
timeline for Canada and other countries? I don't know if we have a timeline, but of course,

49:12.880 --> 49:19.120
by popular demand, it's probably the order that we'll tackle. It'll probably be Canada slash

49:19.120 --> 49:24.240
Australia would be the second one. And then of course, Mike V, we got to hook up Mike V. He's

49:24.240 --> 49:29.600
over there just carrying the whole country on his back over there in New Zealand. New Zealand love.

49:30.640 --> 49:37.040
Yes. Okay. And then let's keep just a couple more and then we're going to have to go through

49:37.040 --> 49:40.400
and just answer these. Bruce says, one last question. Will you be doing a bit further

49:40.400 --> 49:45.040
training inside of the rare Facebook group? Yeah. So I made a ranking or an engine Facebook group.

49:45.760 --> 49:51.200
We can share that here, basically for this community, people using this platform. So if you

49:51.200 --> 49:55.920
guys want to join that, just search ranking or an engine and jump in. There's not much there right

49:55.920 --> 50:04.640
now, but I intend to share more trainings and more product roadmap and things like that. So you guys

50:04.640 --> 50:09.280
are constantly getting the latest from me in there as well. Let's answer one more question and we'll

50:09.280 --> 50:13.040
get into beta stuff. Luke Hill, and I think this is important, he says, so why wouldn't Google give

50:13.040 --> 50:17.840
that on Google Keyword Planner or why wouldn't other tools like Ahrefs or SEMrush use the same

50:17.840 --> 50:23.600
API? Why do you think that is? Because we're talking about how this data isn't going to third

50:23.600 --> 50:29.520
parties. Why do you think they're not using that? Good question. I can't speak for why other

50:29.520 --> 50:35.360
platforms were built the way that they were. Every keyword tool has its little nuances,

50:35.360 --> 50:42.160
has its differences, right? For our industry, we are very focused on the local search volume,

50:42.160 --> 50:48.800
the local keywords. There's nothing built for that. It's like, what is the fastest path to

50:48.800 --> 50:53.600
knowing in that local market what that search volume is, what that cost per click is, right?

50:53.600 --> 50:59.760
So I chose like, hey, the gold standard for this after running, you know, I've ran probably $300,

50:59.760 --> 51:06.960
$400,000 of ads now is going to come from Google, right? That is the place to get the gold standard

51:06.960 --> 51:11.600
of information and data for me. And so I wanted to tie that in, right? I can't speak to some of

51:11.600 --> 51:15.440
these other choices for the way they build theirs. They're catering off into much bigger

51:15.440 --> 51:19.760
corporations, right? Like how many people are searching for sneakers by Nike, right? You know,

51:19.760 --> 51:24.960
that's not what we're doing. And so I built our tool bespoke for our use case.

51:26.000 --> 51:29.600
Which I think is super interesting because a lot of people with tools, they want to, they're like

51:29.600 --> 51:34.400
thinking, well, I want to, I want to build this tool so that we can get people in this industry,

51:34.400 --> 51:39.120
in this industry, in this industry want to make. And of course, this is a moneymaking product.

51:39.120 --> 51:45.600
Ryan's isn't just a charity. However, Ryan makes his money from doing rank and rent. And so this is

51:46.240 --> 51:50.320
not only, of course, it's a way to make money, but it's also a way to scale his rank and rent

51:50.320 --> 51:55.120
agency even further. And so I think the best products, the best tools always come from people

51:55.120 --> 51:59.360
inside that industry because they know the pain points. Whereas somebody from the outside coming

51:59.360 --> 52:03.840
in to build it just to make money, it's never going to cater exactly because they don't know

52:03.840 --> 52:08.800
those pains. So anyway, let's, we only have a couple of minutes, right? How do people,

52:08.800 --> 52:15.680
and I'm going to try it. We'll try our best maybe to either do like a Q and a session later,

52:16.640 --> 52:20.560
or just go in and answer these questions. But how do people, if they want to get on the beta

52:21.200 --> 52:25.840
discount, how do they sign up? And what does that look like price wise, et cetera? We have 38 people

52:25.840 --> 52:30.320
on, let's show them that really quick. Give them the link and let them go start playing around with

52:30.320 --> 52:37.040
this amazing tool. For sure. Yeah. Yeah. Nick hooked it up. You guys are getting early access.

52:37.040 --> 52:43.440
So you go to rentandrentengine.com. You can click create a free account. And then for the first 50

52:43.440 --> 52:52.720
people that use Ignition 24, so all capitals, no spaces, Ignition 24, one word, will get 20%

52:52.720 --> 52:57.600
off. So the first tier is 97 bucks a month. You can cancel your main goals. You can cancel your

52:57.600 --> 53:02.160
SEM rush, right? Like you're going to go in here and see that, you know, this is very much a cost

53:02.160 --> 53:10.000
savings tool for you guys. And you're getting 20% off on top of that. What's the code? Ignition 24.

53:10.000 --> 53:19.040
That's the first two months at 20% off. So IGNITION24. We can put it in the, in the chat

53:19.040 --> 53:25.520
or 24, all lowercase, all uppercase. So you know, it's case sensitive, but I just put it in.

53:25.520 --> 53:33.840
Oh, I misspelled it. Time too fast. I don't delete that comment. All right. Ignition 24,

53:34.640 --> 53:37.520
like starting a car night. Beautiful.

53:41.040 --> 53:46.480
Also real quick, Daniel Kelly. Okay, good. I spelled it correctly too. Okay. Daniel Kelly,

53:46.480 --> 53:52.560
go look at your previous comment. I dropped the recommended niches for you specifically. I

53:53.280 --> 53:56.560
spent some time to write that comment out. So guys, if you are interested

53:57.120 --> 54:02.480
on a 20% discount for the first, I think it's 50 people is what it's capped at. What we're,

54:02.480 --> 54:08.720
and by the way, this is coming to you guys first. We haven't taken this to the free group. We haven't

54:08.720 --> 54:13.120
taken this to, you know, whatever. We're going to be doing an official, official, official, official

54:13.120 --> 54:20.000
launch next, probably in about a month, depending on how this beta test goes. Could be as early as

54:20.000 --> 54:30.560
two weeks, but most likely first of November. But yeah, go in, play with this and just know that

54:30.560 --> 54:34.720
you guys are, you guys are our people. We're excited. We want to get as much feedback as

54:34.720 --> 54:38.400
possible. If people have feedback, where would be the best place? Should they go in the Facebook

54:38.400 --> 54:44.800
group and drop a comment? Because I don't want to make a huge mess here, like DMing you and stuff

54:44.800 --> 54:47.840
like that. Where should they go for support? Should they go to the Facebook group and drop a

54:48.480 --> 54:51.760
question, comment? Like what would be the quickest way to give feedback?

54:52.480 --> 54:57.520
Yeah. If they want, it's only positive things that I accept. No, I'm just kidding. If you want to go

54:57.520 --> 55:01.760
to ask feedback, you could talk about it in the Facebook group, but if you want it the

55:03.360 --> 55:08.880
most direct and organized way that I'm categorizing this stuff is when you create an account in this

55:08.880 --> 55:15.680
top corner, you'll get your user profile information, click on support. It's going to pull up this form.

55:15.760 --> 55:25.840
And so this form is going to be refreshed. Here we go. It's your rare user support request form.

55:25.840 --> 55:30.960
So you put in anything that you see in here, hit submit. It's a super short form. It'll go straight

55:30.960 --> 55:36.800
to me, into my email. And so I can see anything going on. And you're also free to DM me as well.

55:36.800 --> 55:42.080
Just find me on Facebook and send me a DM. If you guys would though, I mean, for the benefit

55:42.080 --> 55:46.800
of the community, if you could do that form, it would make it easier for Ryan to address

55:47.600 --> 55:52.880
these things and also update. So I know sometimes you get frustrated when a fire off a message

55:52.880 --> 55:58.560
and, you know, whatever, but if you guys will do that, maybe you do both. If you're really,

55:58.560 --> 56:04.160
it's a really quick thing you want to get answered, but this is going to allow Ryan to continue to

56:04.160 --> 56:10.160
make this tool even better and better. Okay. So one more time. Okay. Shane real quick says,

56:11.040 --> 56:16.160
awesome. Can you increase your package at any time? Sure can. Yep. You can also do add on sites. So

56:16.160 --> 56:21.520
if you've got 10 sites, you can do add on sites as well without having to upgrade your package.

56:22.320 --> 56:26.800
Or you can, you know, choose the highest tier if you want to. Right. So anytime that's available

56:26.800 --> 56:32.080
for you guys. And then Jahil has a good question. He said, how does the search volume, how does the

56:32.080 --> 56:37.440
search volume do when searching for Metmo? That's exactly, well, guys, this tool, as of last week,

56:37.440 --> 56:41.440
right when we went live, that was like when we started basically being able to play with it as

56:41.440 --> 56:45.920
well. So that's one of the things that I'm going to be looking at in the next few weeks

56:46.960 --> 56:52.640
is when we type in a Bentonville concrete, when you type in that, that key site, what is that minimum

56:52.640 --> 56:57.920
search volume? So, uh, stay just a little bit patient with me as we figure that out. I don't

56:57.920 --> 57:03.040
want to come out and say, Oh, when it says this, you know, then that's a, uh, for sure, because I'm

57:03.040 --> 57:08.080
not a hundred percent there yet, but this is now I'm confident because we have control over the tool

57:08.080 --> 57:13.920
that we can give you that with a 90% confidence rating type of thing. So, um, again, guys,

57:14.480 --> 57:21.120
if you are interested in the beta, go to rankandrentengine.com and choose your package.

57:21.120 --> 57:26.960
And then the ignition all caps, we think ignition 24, maybe not case sensitive. I don't know to get

57:26.960 --> 57:34.160
20% off, uh, for the first, how many months? Two months, first two months. And then one more thing,

57:34.160 --> 57:42.800
Matt says, could an overseas VA team call using the tracking numbers? Uh, there's not anything to

57:42.800 --> 57:51.440
have, uh, those dial out right now. Um, but I've got some ideas for that. So stay tuned. Beautiful,

57:51.440 --> 57:58.400
beautiful. Okay. I think we, I mean, I think that's pretty much it guys. Um, go test it out,

57:58.400 --> 58:06.480
play with it. Uh, if you guys are like the lowest package is 99 bucks, 97, you get a 20% discount.

58:06.480 --> 58:13.600
We're at, let's call it 80 bucks, 80 bucks a month. SEM rush is 129 a month, just for the search

58:13.600 --> 58:19.120
volume. Like it's at the lowest package, it's, it's a no brainer, especially with the, with the

58:19.120 --> 58:27.920
discount. Okay. Um, you can use it for SEP. Okay. Anyway, um, Kirk says just registered,

58:27.920 --> 58:31.280
but it's us only, do we lose out on the offer? Any idea on the UK feature?

58:33.840 --> 58:39.200
Uh, so let's see, just registered. That's right. Yep. So it's, it's still just us only, right? So,

58:39.200 --> 58:44.720
um, if you're, if you're in the UK or Canada, Australia, like we've heard you guys, you know,

58:44.720 --> 58:48.080
we want to keep building this out for you guys. We're starting with the U S and then we're going

58:48.080 --> 58:52.960
to expand it out from there. Um, Kurt messaged me when, when that time comes, we'll do something

58:52.960 --> 59:01.840
special for every guy and, uh, gal in the UK. Um, one thing on, uh, dial outs, there are third

59:01.840 --> 59:08.960
party programs that you can use like talking to that you can actually plug in your, uh, SEP

59:08.960 --> 59:15.760
and SID. Oops. Um, this SID, I haven't tested that with this yet. Um, but you guys might be able to,

59:16.240 --> 59:20.560
do it that way, right? So, um, that's, that's a possibility in any case, in the future,

59:20.560 --> 59:24.960
we'll be able to make it to where you guys can use your numbers for dialing out using tools,

59:24.960 --> 59:29.120
um, either natively built in or third party, but, um, that doesn't exist right now.

59:30.160 --> 59:35.520
Beautiful. Ryan Dalton, you've done, you've done miracles, my friend. I'm excited to, uh,

59:35.520 --> 59:42.800
get in play with this myself, get our entire agency over here. And, uh, yeah, anybody else guys,

59:42.800 --> 59:48.160
again, Marcus just shared it one more time. Ignition 24, go to rankinventag.com sign up for

59:48.160 --> 59:53.680
the package and let's, let's, let's go, let's go test this thing out. Let's go and give Ryan

59:53.680 --> 59:59.440
as much feedback as possible and, and start, um, building our agencies on this. Yeah, man,

59:59.440 --> 01:00:02.960
go build scale and automate. Let's do it. Thanks, Ryan. See you.
