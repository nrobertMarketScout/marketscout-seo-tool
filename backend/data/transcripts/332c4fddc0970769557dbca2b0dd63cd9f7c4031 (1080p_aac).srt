1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
So here's what you're going to do, Edward. I would make sure to do everything you can,

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:11,360
get this sucker ranked, manage those expectations, and get ready to get that business owner into a

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,800
sixth month to a year contract as soon as possible. What I would do is after month two,

4
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,800
I would start, I would figure out maybe we need to bump up the ads a little bit.

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,600
Maybe we need to like check in extra, whatever, because I know that between month two and three

6
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:32,800
is when I need to renew. And if you don't renew for at least six months in October,

7
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,520
there's a good chance they're going to cancel. If you go to a month to month,

8
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,600
by December things slow down and it's Christmas and all these different things,

9
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,400
it's going to be a problem. So what I would do is I would crush it for this person in both areas.

10
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,600
In between months two and three, I would really up my game so that you can get those

11
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,000
re-signs into the six month a year contracts. And then you could kind of take a little bit

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,440
of a deep breath and go back to your strategy. But from experience, that's what I would do.

13
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:08,000
Also a friendly reminder, guys, I would not be recommending a six month contract right now.

14
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:15,200
August, September, October, November, December, January, that's going to put you in a really

15
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,400
weird spot. You're going to have a contract ending at the end of Christmas. And unless you're in the

16
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,960
snow removal niche and you're in a city that has snow year round, which I don't know if there are

17
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,560
any, it's going to be a problem. So guys, I know the training says six month contracts,

18
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,560
but we have to also use our head. Right now, I would do what Edward is doing. I would either

19
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,960
do a three month or I'd do a nine month. I would definitely push for the nine month before the

20
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:45,360
three month. But keep in mind, if you do a six month, the contract's going to end in the middle

21
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,320
of the freaking winter and it's going to be a problem. It's really hard to renew contracts,

22
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,440
relatively speaking, in the middle of the winter.
