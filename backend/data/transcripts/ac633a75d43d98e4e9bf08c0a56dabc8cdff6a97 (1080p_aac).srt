1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,760
All right, we have two different type of ad accounts within Google, and those two are

2
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,280
your just regular standard Google Ad account, Google Adwords account, and your what they

3
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,120
call MCC, and I believe that stands for My Client Center.

4
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:29,120
I could be wrong, and I don't care, okay, but I prefer to use the MCC.

5
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,920
I'm going to talk about both really quick.

6
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,720
The regular standard one, if you've never set up ads, you're going to be by default

7
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,640
be pushed over to that one, and what that is is basically you can set up one account,

8
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,560
and you can set up multiple campaigns underneath that one account.

9
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:47,120
The reason I like the MCC account is, well, I plan on doing this for real.

10
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,040
I plan on doing this big time, number one, but number two, it's just like an organizational

11
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:55,320
thing, so what I like to personally do is I like for every single project, I like to

12
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,200
have a new account and a new campaign.

13
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,280
It's just really nice, let's just say I'm doing Minneapolis Concrete, then I'm going

14
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,280
to create a new account.

15
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,280
I'm going to show you guys all this.

16
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:09,280
I'm going to create a Minneapolis Concrete account, and then I'm going to be able to

17
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:15,960
create a campaign within that one that's Minneapolis Concrete, and it's the campaign.

18
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,320
It's just a nice organizational tool so that I don't have to go in, it's one account, it's

19
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,400
just this smorgasbord of stuff.

20
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,760
However, I would prefer you to go fast, so if you're somebody that's never set up ads,

21
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,080
I would prefer you to just, whatever pops up when you go to Google, just set one up,

22
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,640
get them running, and we can go in later and switch the MCC account.

23
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,480
I don't want you slowing down.

24
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,480
That's the biggest thing.

25
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,360
I don't want you slowing down for anything.

26
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,360
Now, really, really quick, because I'm going to share my screen in just a moment.

27
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,920
In version 1.0, I use a regular Google Ad account, so for this training, I'm going to

28
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,400
use an MCC account.

29
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:53,200
If you're somebody that's new and like, oh my gosh, what does it look like if it's regular?

30
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,200
Just go and look at version 1.0.

31
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,640
I'm going to leave that in the Facebook group.

32
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:02,000
Go to the module 3, the digital steroids, and you'll see an example of setting it up

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,200
with just a regular Google Ad account that comes as default.

34
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,040
I want to show you an MCC account to be fair to those that have MCC accounts.

35
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:13,480
Lastly, if you have a regular account or you set up a regular account, you just need to

36
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,640
get in touch with Google.

37
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,920
I know they're a pain in the butt to reach, but to my knowledge, that's the easiest way

38
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,560
is you're going to find a number.

39
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,360
I'm going to see if I can find a number, put it in the description of a quick way to reach

40
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,600
It's always changing.

41
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,120
Plus, we're blaming it on COVID, and I honestly don't know.

42
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,720
It's always adjusting.

43
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:33,640
Get a hold of them and tell them you want to switch to an MCC account, and they'll do

44
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,640
it for you.

45
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,640
Okay?

46
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,640
I'm going to share my screen now.

47
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,640
All right.

48
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,080
Guys, quickest, easiest way, go to Google, and you're going to be blown away.

49
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,200
Type in Google AdWords.

50
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,200
Google AdWords.

51
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,200
Really, really simple.

52
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,200
Okay?

53
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,200
First thing that comes up is going to be the ad.

54
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,560
You can either click on that one if you want to charge Google.

55
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,560
They probably don't charge themselves.

56
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,560
I'm going to click on it.

57
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,560
If they charge themselves, they're idiots.

58
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,760
Okay?

59
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,840
Now, what you're going to do is you're going to sign in.

60
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,840
Now, you can do this however you want.

61
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,680
I would use some kind of company email or something that is going to be more broad rather

62
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:11,320
than just setting this up under your bentonvilleconcrete at gmail.com.

63
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,640
That's just my recommendation, but don't overthink this.

64
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,640
It doesn't matter.

65
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,200
I do want you to notice, though, it is going to ask you to sign in, and in some cases it

66
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:22,480
may just sign you in automatically based on the email you already logged into.

67
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,600
Guys, if you're not using Chrome for whatever number of time, go switch to Chrome.

68
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,600
Just trust me.

69
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,600
Okay?

70
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,600
All right, so I'm going to sign in.

71
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:35,160
All right, so guys, what you're seeing here is my Google Ad account.

72
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,440
This is my MCC account.

73
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,580
It's going to look a little bit different than some of yours are going to look.

74
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,680
If you guys do not have an MCC account, it's okay.

75
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:47,480
One thing I want to point out, if I haven't shown you already, I have run $1.2 million

76
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,480
of my own money.

77
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,480
I don't have any partners.

78
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,480
I don't have any of that.

79
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,040
This is my own hard-earned money.

80
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:57,320
I know what to not do and teach you what not to do because I have spent this.

81
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:01,080
Notice how I didn't say, I'll teach you what to do, because I feel like sometimes I learn

82
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:05,580
by learning what not to do, but I have spent a good chunk of change learning what I'm about

83
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,580
to show you.

84
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,580
Okay?

85
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,520
First thing I'm going to teach you to do is just to set up a new account.

86
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,520
Okay?

87
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,520
Very, very simple.

88
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:17,080
Again, we're talking about inside of an MCC account, so if you have your own, you have

89
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:21,360
a different regular Google, if yours looks different than this, it's okay.

90
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,640
We just need to get an account set up.

91
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,640
Okay?

92
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,640
Really, really simple.

93
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:30,120
If you do have an MCC account, just click on, you guessed it, accounts, and then you

94
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,600
see this plus sign.

95
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,600
What would you think you would get?

96
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,480
If I were to hold a gun to your head, you'd probably be like, yeah, I probably want to

97
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,480
hit the plus.

98
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,480
Push the plus button.

99
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,480
Okay?

100
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:43,000
Then it's going to say, create new manager account, nope, create new account.

101
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,600
I don't want a new manager account.

102
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,600
That's the MCC account.

103
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,600
I just want a new account.

104
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,600
Okay?

105
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:53,400
Set one up for the project that we are currently doing with this example.

106
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,400
Okay?

107
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,040
So, next thing that you're going to do is you're just going to put in a little bit of

108
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,040
information.

109
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,040
Okay?

110
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,640
So, on the account name, I just like to keep it really clean, and I like to put Queen Creek

111
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,640
Concrete.

112
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,640
Go figure.

113
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,640
Okay?

114
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,640
All right.

115
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,640
Type.

116
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:14,640
Now, this is where you need to pay attention.

117
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,640
Okay?

118
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:21,440
I'm going to have you do the smart campaign type, okay?

119
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,440
Trust me on this.

120
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,840
I know there's some of you guys that have been in the game forever, and you're like,

121
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,840
oh, I'm not going to do that because blah, blah, blah.

122
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:31,120
If you guys already know Google Ads like the back of your hand, then be my guest, but

123
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,040
if you've never run Google Ads, trust me, I understand if you look online, it's going

124
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,120
to charge you a little bit more money, but guess what it does?

125
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,320
It allows you to go fast, and money loves speed.

126
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,320
Okay?

127
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,120
So, you're not going to choose Google Ad account.

128
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,040
You're going to choose smart campaign account.

129
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,440
Boom.

130
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,440
Okay?

131
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,440
Select your country.

132
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,440
I don't care what country you're in.

133
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,440
Select your country.

134
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,440
I'm in the U.S., obviously.

135
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,440
Select your time zone.

136
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,440
Okay?

137
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:59,560
Honestly, I don't know if the way to do it is to select the time zone of the project,

138
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,560
whatever.

139
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,960
Typically, with this, what I understand is if you're going to do it by certain times,

140
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,440
and we're not going to mess that, so it doesn't matter.

141
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,200
I will probably do it as Phoenix time just for the heck of it.

142
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,200
Okay?

143
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:14,640
Select your currency, and then we're not going to invite any users, so just save and continue.

144
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,240
Okay?

145
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,600
Now, it says you're about blah, blah, blah, okay.

146
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,080
You're making important changes to your account.

147
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,080
Keep your data safe.

148
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,080
Please confirm it's really okay.

149
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,080
It's going to confirm.

150
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,080
Okay.

151
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:33,200
So, now my account is set up, and I have so many, I like to just filter this and go name,

152
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:42,920
and I'm going to do Queen Creek, and here we are, ready, set, go.

153
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:50,480
So, guys, we've now successfully set up an account within our MCC My Client Center account.

154
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:55,080
If you are just using regular, like it's your first time logging in on that email, it's

155
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,640
probably already going to have an account set up.

156
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,560
If not, just push new account.

157
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,040
It's very, very easy to do.

158
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:07,400
Again, if you do not have an MCC, it's okay, and on version 1.0, I use a regular account,

159
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,560
so don't overthink it.

160
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,560
Don't stress it.

161
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,800
We are going to go and set up a campaign.
