1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,560
I want to tell you guys and share with you guys what I consider to be my secret weapon

2
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,960
and it should be yours as well.

3
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,960
Okay, this is called the pullback and the reason I'm putting this video right here,

4
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,720
we just got done talking about the four steps to the perfect prospecting script.

5
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,620
I want to tell you about the pullback because this is going to be an opportunity where you're

6
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:32,100
probably first going to need to use this.

7
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,660
Okay, I'm going to tell you a couple of the situations in which you would use it.

8
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,020
I'm going to tell you how to properly use it and I'm going to tell you how often you

9
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:43,420
should use it so you don't overuse it, okay, and if you actually can overuse it.

10
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:50,340
So first of all, the pullback, what the pullback is, is it's you basically making a statement

11
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,460
that lets them know, hey, it puts them in their place.

12
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,940
It checks them and lets them know, hey, you need this more than I need this, okay?

13
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:58,940
That's the pullback.

14
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,260
Pulling away.

15
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:04,580
And you know, for the first couple steps, you know, one, two, three, who I am, what

16
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:08,780
I'm doing, what's the deal, transition, it's been go, I'm coming at them, I'm coming at

17
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:12,740
them, I'm coming at them, I'm coming at them and a lot of times you're going to need at

18
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:16,940
this point to do a pullback and what this is going to do is it's going to put you back

19
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:19,960
in control because you need people coming to you.

20
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:25,420
You need to be in control of the deal and so the pullback is something that you can

21
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:29,700
use any time, there's a couple different places that you can use this but I will say

22
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,300
this, couple rules of thumb with the pullback.

23
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:35,900
First of all, you could use this as many times as you need and you're not going to ruin the

24
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:36,900
deal.

25
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:37,900
You are not going to ruin the deal.

26
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:42,620
As long as you're talking to the right people and you're not being salesy and you're doing

27
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:47,860
the stuff right and you're giving leads in advance, you will not lose a deal by doing

28
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:48,860
too many pullbacks.

29
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:49,860
I promise you.

30
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:50,860
That's the cool part.

31
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,300
You don't have to worry about overusing the pullback, okay?

32
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,020
Here's a couple places I like to use it.

33
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:59,140
This is a really good point I like to use it at because sometimes, and I've seen this

34
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,980
and you guys have probably seen this in the group, is you get through, you do your pitch

35
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:05,980
and the business owner, they're all yeses, baby.

36
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:06,980
Yeah, sounds good.

37
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:07,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

38
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:08,980
Okay, cool.

39
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:09,980
Sounds good.

40
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:10,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

41
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:11,980
It's all yes.

42
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:12,980
No questions.

43
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:13,980
No objections.

44
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:14,980
No nothing.

45
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:15,980
You're like, dude, this is a golden ticket.

46
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:16,980
This guy is sold.

47
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:17,980
That's what you're thinking in your head.

48
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:18,980
Let me tell you what.

49
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:23,980
Truth is, this guy or this lady is too scared to tell you no and so it's coming out as yeah,

50
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,460
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

51
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,460
Really?

52
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,260
They couldn't be further from a yeah.

53
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:32,880
So if you start getting the yes guy, the yes lady, I want you to use a pullback.

54
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,700
Something like this, okay?

55
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,700
You get to the end and everything's a yes.

56
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,020
Hey, I'm gonna send you a couple free leads.

57
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,020
We're gonna talk in a couple days.

58
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,020
How's that sound?

59
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,020
Cool.

60
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,020
Sounds good.

61
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

62
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,020
Sounds good.

63
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,020
And they're rushing you and it's just yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

64
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,020
And you're like, this sounds too good to be true.

65
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,020
It is.

66
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,020
Okay?

67
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,020
Here's what you're gonna do.

68
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,020
You're gonna stop them and say, hey, look, that sounds good.

69
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,980
I just want to double check.

70
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:57,340
First of all, don't take this wrong, but Jack, shoot me straight here, man.

71
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:00,060
I'm a grown ass man.

72
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:04,420
Are you interested in growing your business or are you just too scared to tell me no?

73
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:09,140
And I know, guys, I know that sounds bold, but I don't got time to waste these people,

74
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,140
okay?

75
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:14,500
So I'm literally gonna say, hey, Jack, real quick, before I hang up, I just don't want

76
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,500
to waste your time.

77
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,500
I don't want to waste my time.

78
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,080
I'm a grown ass man here, so shoot me straight.

79
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,820
Are you interested in growing your company or you just don't want to tell me no?

80
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,860
Because these are jobs that are coming in.

81
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:27,700
I only work with one company per area.

82
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:31,420
So if this isn't something like you don't want to grow and whatever, that's cool.

83
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,420
Just let me know now.

84
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,660
But just don't waste my time, okay?

85
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:38,380
And I know you're like, oh my gosh, you're gonna ruin the deal.

86
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,380
Nope.

87
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,260
Just the opposite, okay?

88
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,260
Just the opposite.

89
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,820
What you're gonna do is you're gonna wake their ass up.

90
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:48,340
And if they've been sitting there sleeping going, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, if they actually

91
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,220
are interested, you know what they're gonna do?

92
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,620
They're gonna all of a sudden come after you.

93
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,580
They're gonna go, oh, no, no, no, no, man, listen.

94
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,580
It's funny.

95
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,620
He's like, sorry, I'm driving.

96
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,620
And I kind of sound distracted, but I'm really interested.

97
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:03,340
Me and my partner or I was actually just talking to my wife or I was just talking to my husband

98
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,260
and I was just saying how much I'm tired, sick and tired of home.

99
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,500
They will start to sell you.

100
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:12,580
And the other cool part is if they're not following you and they really are the yes,

101
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:15,860
yes, yes, yes, yes, but they just don't want to tell you no, you know what they're gonna

102
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:16,860
say?

103
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:20,380
They're gonna say, yeah, man, like I don't want to, like I really don't want to waste

104
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,380
your time.

105
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,260
And if you have somebody else, like we're good.

106
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,260
We're good.

107
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,260
Okay.

108
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:30,500
And you're just gonna give them an opportunity to just walk away and you're gonna give them

109
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,500
an out.

110
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,740
Because what happens a lot of time with these yes, yes, yes, is you hang up the phone.

111
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:36,740
You're jacked.

112
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:37,740
You post to the group.

113
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,900
I just got somebody hooked, baby.

114
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:40,900
Let's go.

115
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:41,900
Okay.

116
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:42,900
Guess what happens?

117
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:43,900
You get the lead.

118
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:44,900
Get them on the phone.

119
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:45,900
You get Janet on the phone.

120
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,460
You go to call Jack back.

121
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,460
Jack doesn't answer.

122
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,500
Oh, Jack's on a job.

123
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,620
Hey, Janet.

124
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,620
Jack's gonna be calling you.

125
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,620
No problem.

126
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:54,620
24 hours later.

127
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,620
Jack's gone.

128
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,300
Jack's ghost mode, baby.

129
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,300
Jack is off.

130
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,860
Jack's phone number's changed.

131
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,940
Like guys, that guy's ghosting you.

132
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,100
You will never hear from them again.

133
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,940
And the problem is they were never following you in the first place.

134
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,260
They were too scared to tell you no.

135
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:11,360
And yes, I know that sounds funny because we're talking about grown ass men and women

136
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,580
lying to your face.

137
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,940
It happens every single day.

138
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:21,140
So I love using the pullback at the end of step four, the transition, to just make sure

139
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,140
they are following me.

140
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:26,380
That's if I, you know, if it sounds too good to be true, use the pullback, okay?

141
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:31,860
The other end of that is if someone is kind of being short with you, they're kind of acting

142
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:32,980
too busy.

143
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:37,500
They're acting like they're doing you a favor, like, yeah, I mean, I'm busy, but like I can

144
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,980
take some jobs if you want to send them to me.

145
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,020
In my head, I'm like, look, bro, you don't understand.

146
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:47,100
I'm not like, I got too much going on to be doing favors, right?

147
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,980
Like I'm happy to send you some to earn your business, to gain your trust, but I'm not

148
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:53,660
just like, you don't need to do me a favor, okay?

149
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:57,700
And I'll use a pullback then and I'll go, hey, just real quick, like, just, I want you

150
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,880
to know I only work with one company.

151
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:06,180
So if this is going to be a burden for you to take on more work, by like, make no mistake,

152
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,140
I don't need you to take on this work.

153
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:11,620
I'm asking you if you're hungry to go, are you hungry to go?

154
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:15,060
And I know that's a little aggressive and do I say it that bold every time?

155
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,060
No, sometimes do I?

156
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:19,020
Yes, because I'm just feeling it and I'm just not in the mood.

157
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,700
You guys can say this in your own way.

158
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:25,220
You don't need to be that bold, but you need to convey the fact that, hey, you need to

159
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:29,580
let them know that they need you more than you need them.

160
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:33,960
And I need you guys to mentally realize you don't need them.

161
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:39,620
There are 20, there are at least five to 20 to 50 different options in each city, in each

162
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:42,300
service that you can work with.

163
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,300
Guess what?

164
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,380
There's only one of you.

165
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,780
And we forget this.

166
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:49,740
We think that all of a sudden we got one option, we got one option that's the person and if

167
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,740
they don't do it, we're screwed.

168
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,060
No, that's not the truth.

169
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:56,260
The truth is you're the only person and you're the one that has what they need and you know

170
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,300
that because they're already paying for ads.

171
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:03,140
So get that in your damn mind and start using pullbacks and be bold.

172
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,900
And I do want to mention this and I'll talk about this, I'll talk about pullbacks later

173
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,620
in future videos.

174
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:12,700
You're also going to be able to use a pullback anytime during the process where the deal

175
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:17,620
sounds shaky, where the customer's not answering the phone, where the customer is just wasting

176
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:21,420
your time or you feel like they're wasting your time, use the pullback.

177
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:25,140
It is literally the secret weapon and I know it's very, very scary, especially the first

178
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:28,700
time you're like, oh my gosh, I just got through this really scary pitch and they said yes

179
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:32,260
and now I'm going to be that bold to just throw it all away.

180
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,260
Nope, you're not throwing it away.

181
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:38,980
You are just sifting out the crappy from the people that are actually serious, you're sifting

182
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:43,180
out the people who are not serious from the ones that are ready to rock and roll.

183
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:48,140
The pullback is a freaking secret weapon, master it, get used to it, I'll try and drop

184
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:55,300
some swipes but really the principle is you just need to convey that they need you more

185
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,500
than you need them.
