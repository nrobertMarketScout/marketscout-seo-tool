00:00.000 --> 00:07.120
Jeff, what are the common things, most common things that you're seeing and let's, let's yeah,

00:07.120 --> 00:10.160
what are the most common things you're seeing of why people are getting suspended? Let's start there.

00:10.800 --> 00:16.640
Great. Well, so there are the, one of the common things that I'm seeing is,

00:18.000 --> 00:21.760
there are several of them, but one of them is, is people are setting up

00:21.760 --> 00:25.760
their MCC account and they're, and a lot of them are doing it like on their first time,

00:26.320 --> 00:31.920
fresh Google ads, like first ad they've ever ran. And it seems like there's a lot of guys

00:31.920 --> 00:37.680
that are missing a step. And I know not, I don't know if everybody has access to the 2.0,

00:37.680 --> 00:42.480
but I've been referring, if you have access to 1.0, that's how you should be setting up your ad.

00:43.360 --> 00:49.120
If you have access to 2.0, your video goes over that in really good detail, but I've kind of

00:49.120 --> 00:54.000
referred them all back to say, go back through that and just really, really slow. And a lot of

00:54.000 --> 01:00.800
what it is, I'll use the word like the hierarchy of how you set up an MCC account. So what some of

01:00.800 --> 01:06.400
them are doing is they're setting up, and this is going to be one type of suspension that I'm seeing.

01:06.400 --> 01:09.760
So some people that are setting up their ads, they feel like they're getting some running and

01:09.760 --> 01:13.600
then they have to get that verification comes through. Then they go run their verification

01:13.600 --> 01:18.240
and they can't get verified. And what's, what I'm seeing as a common theme with them is they set up

01:18.240 --> 01:24.720
the MCC. So they set up their, I'm going to call it like their Google ad profile. Like they use

01:24.720 --> 01:30.720
that Gmail to open up a Google ads and they do an MCC. And then they start running campaigns

01:30.720 --> 01:36.000
directly underneath that. And if you go into the MCC, there's actually a spot where it says add

01:36.000 --> 01:41.600
account. And you need to, before you run a campaign, you need to add an account that goes

01:41.600 --> 01:49.040
underneath that, that goes inside of that or under, if this was like your Google ad profile,

01:49.040 --> 01:53.520
you add an account here and then you add a campaign underneath that. And that's how like

01:53.520 --> 01:58.800
the hierarchy of it should go. What's happening is people are setting up that, yeah, you got a

01:58.800 --> 02:03.440
piece of paper. Yeah. Just what you're saying. It's like, yeah, by the way, real quick, for those

02:03.440 --> 02:07.920
that are just brand new today, tell them what an MCC account, I know we're going very fundamental,

02:07.920 --> 02:11.600
but let's just, what is an MCC account for someone that's like, what's that mean?

02:12.640 --> 02:19.600
Well, it's, I would prefer people not do it until they have like 15 or 20 ads because it

02:19.600 --> 02:25.520
gets confusing if you've never done it. But essentially it's, it's an account that you use

02:25.520 --> 02:33.360
to manage quote unquote other people's ad accounts or you get brought on as a verifier. So like I run

02:33.360 --> 02:39.120
a lot of Google ads for some political consulting that I do, and I will get added as the admin

02:39.120 --> 02:45.760
or the manager for them. So my, my account will take over and has access to it. Basically it's

02:45.760 --> 02:51.280
through a proxy that they give me. When you set up your own MCC and you set up the own accounts,

02:51.280 --> 02:57.520
you can do that. But it, if you've never done one, it can be a little confusing for people.

02:57.840 --> 03:06.160
Some people are setting up their MCC as a, like just like, it's like a solo account instead of

03:06.160 --> 03:10.640
just doing an account. And on the right-hand side where your little profile picture is,

03:10.640 --> 03:15.120
it's just adding an account, adding an account, add an account. They're kind of running the MCC

03:15.120 --> 03:19.680
that same way. And that's not how that's supposed to be managed. So the MCC is kind of like the,

03:20.480 --> 03:26.400
like the overseer of multiple ad accounts. Like I have multiple ad accounts for multiple clients

03:26.400 --> 03:33.040
that are not related to each other at all. So guys, essentially if you guys like,

03:33.040 --> 03:38.480
let's say it's your first time you go to Google ads. And I, and to my understanding, Jeff, maybe

03:38.480 --> 03:43.280
you can correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think they ever just automatically give you an

03:43.280 --> 03:48.560
MCC account. It's by default, they just give you a regular account, right? Yeah. You have to, yeah,

03:48.560 --> 03:53.360
you do have to, I think I'm going to use the word apply for it. It's been so long since I've done

03:53.360 --> 03:57.840
that, but I think you just hit it and you like kind of apply for it when you sign up initially

03:57.840 --> 04:01.600
and you can apply for it. But that, that's kind of what's triggering some of these people's

04:01.600 --> 04:07.040
verification issues. And because they didn't set up the MCC right, the way that it's the, they,

04:07.040 --> 04:11.520
they don't have like the account and then the campaign, they have all the campaigns under it.

04:11.520 --> 04:16.480
Well, that, that's supposed to be you like directly who you are. And you try to verify like

04:16.480 --> 04:22.160
all of a sudden five or six websites. And it's like, Whoa, so the Google AI bot that's checking

04:22.160 --> 04:26.880
it just goes, that looks weird. That's not, that's not who you say you are. Cause you all of a sudden

04:26.880 --> 04:32.160
have five or six different like websites or properties you're advertising on. If it was

04:32.160 --> 04:36.880
my property that I registered and I'm running direct ads for me, like say it for my business

04:37.440 --> 04:41.680
and more my domain and everything would match. They might go, Oh, that makes sense. I get it.

04:41.680 --> 04:46.720
You're running your own ads there. But when I'm running like concrete experts and you know,

04:46.800 --> 04:53.280
outdoor kitchen or whatever, I have to set those up in a certain way so that it shows that my main

04:53.280 --> 04:58.720
account is managing that accounts campaigns. Correct. That makes sense. So if you, if you go

04:58.720 --> 05:03.600
in, you've never done ads and you go in, it's, you're going to just set them up. Like he's

05:03.600 --> 05:08.080
talking about, because you're not going to have an MCC account, which is basically a manager account.

05:08.960 --> 05:16.320
Once you, once you convert or apply for an MCC, all he's saying is guys, just make sure that with

05:16.320 --> 05:22.960
each separate property, you guys create an account first as an additional layer. And then

05:22.960 --> 05:28.960
you create the campaign inside of the account. And I saw Marie Marie just said like an umbrella.

05:28.960 --> 05:35.280
It's exactly like that. It's kind of like this. Let's call the top layer is like a grandpa,

05:35.280 --> 05:40.000
right? And then the accounts are your parent accounts. And then you have the child account,

05:40.000 --> 05:45.040
which is the campaigns. So just make sure we're not skipping a step. And guys, with any of these

05:45.040 --> 05:51.520
suspensions, here's how I look at it. You can get mad at Google all you want, but if I was Google,

05:51.520 --> 05:56.720
I would do the same exact shit they're doing. Can you imagine somebody this randomly gets on

05:56.720 --> 06:00.560
and they put in a credit card and let's say it's a word to get into this, it's a gift card or some

06:00.560 --> 06:06.080
random card and they never spent any money. They have a brand new account. I don't know who you are.

06:06.080 --> 06:12.880
I don't give a shit about your 20 bucks a day. I'm Google. I would much rather suspend you.

06:13.840 --> 06:18.480
And then my thinking would be, well, if he's serious about this, he's going to hit me up.

06:18.480 --> 06:23.840
He's going to reach out. He's going to appeal. And if he appeals, then we'll deal with it.

06:23.840 --> 06:27.120
That's a way better because if not, if they just let everyone spend money,

06:27.840 --> 06:31.680
now I'm complaining. We're dealing with the bank. We've got all these partners. So guys,

06:31.680 --> 06:36.560
you get mad at Google all you want, but at that level, you would do the same exact thing.

06:36.560 --> 06:40.080
So whenever you're doing something, think about it. Is this going to look sketchy?

06:40.080 --> 06:45.040
Is this going to make Google think that I am somebody that's sketchy? Guys, a gift card that

06:45.040 --> 06:50.240
has a finite amount of money on the damn card. Like if you were my client, I wouldn't let you

06:50.240 --> 06:54.000
take, put a gift card in there. So why would Google? So that's number one, make sure that it's

06:54.000 --> 07:00.160
set up properly. And I like the word Jeff used hierarchy. You got the MCC, then you got the

07:00.160 --> 07:05.280
account, then you got the campaign. If you don't have an MCC, it's just going to be your regular

07:05.280 --> 07:09.600
login. And then you're going to go straight into your, I think it's just straight into campaigns.

07:10.000 --> 07:15.520
You can only have one, it's one account, right? Well, so you have like your, it's kind of weird

07:15.520 --> 07:20.480
because Google doesn't do a good job of defining it, but like under your ad profile, let's say

07:20.480 --> 07:25.520
whatever Gmail you use, then you set up a Google ad account. If you go back and hit that icon in

07:25.520 --> 07:30.720
the top right, you can just add another account. You just hit add Google account and it kind of

07:30.720 --> 07:36.080
sets it up very similarly to an MCC. Well, you have to log in and out of these different emails.

07:36.560 --> 07:40.960
No, I mean, you can't set up that way. I have, I have multiple, I have like five emails that they

07:40.960 --> 07:46.640
use. And I have the same, I have the same credit card on them. I have the same PayPal account on

07:46.640 --> 07:52.240
them. Like, yeah. So you're almost creating an MCC account by without having an MCC account,

07:52.240 --> 07:56.800
because you have these, you're separating them by different emails or whatever. Some, yes. I have

07:56.800 --> 08:02.480
like kind of groups. And if you go back to like, if for the ones that, if the 2.0 training setting

08:02.480 --> 08:08.080
up the MCC is confusing, if you go back to the 1.0, the original, I think it's module three,

08:08.080 --> 08:14.240
you'll see how you set up a campaign there. You can follow that method and you'll, and that,

08:14.240 --> 08:19.040
like that will be easier if you've never done it. And it's probably going to give less flags and

08:19.040 --> 08:24.320
it's less opportunity for you to screw up. Like what is an ad? What is an account? What is a

08:24.320 --> 08:29.680
profile? What is a campaign? And so I think that anyway, so that's something I would tell everyone,

08:29.680 --> 08:34.480
just go back to those trainings if you have access to one or the other and just go slow.

08:34.480 --> 08:39.440
And by the way, my thought process there, the reason why I used this new account is because

08:39.440 --> 08:43.440
in version 1.0, we did it that way. So I wanted, cause other people were like, well, what about

08:43.440 --> 08:48.400
when it's this way? So that, if you need to just access both, you get the training, you get this

08:48.400 --> 08:54.160
1.0, 2.0 up till whatever point out. So that's number one. What's what else? What other other

08:54.160 --> 08:59.280
things you're seeing? And that's it. So that, are you seeing that trigger a circumventing or a

08:59.280 --> 09:07.040
suspicious payments? I think that one is mostly triggering verification suspension. So they're not

09:07.040 --> 09:14.400
letting people verify. I believe there's been one or two policy violations that had set up their

09:14.400 --> 09:19.760
campaigns wrong in that way. And that's triggering a, a, an issue.
