WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.180
Alright, now we are doing the images for the website.

00:10.180 --> 00:15.280
So we talked a little bit about images in our previous module.

00:15.280 --> 00:22.040
We have said that the best practice is to ask your client for pictures.

00:22.040 --> 00:27.040
If you do not have pictures from your clients, I am going to show you how to get some free

00:27.040 --> 00:28.040
images.

00:28.080 --> 00:31.080
My favorite one is actually Adobe stock images.

00:31.080 --> 00:36.080
You are more than welcome if you know none of your clients are going to give you images

00:36.080 --> 00:40.080
and you need to buy some.

00:40.080 --> 00:43.680
It is definitely worth to get a subscription there.

00:43.680 --> 00:46.400
If you only need a couple, I would do the free trial.

00:46.400 --> 00:51.480
The free trial usually up to this day, it includes 10 images.

00:51.920 --> 00:58.920
Because we need 25 images, you do need to create 3 accounts just to get those 25 images.

00:58.920 --> 01:02.920
It can be time consuming to use the free trial.

01:02.920 --> 01:05.920
That is why this is up to you if you want to pay for them or not.

01:05.920 --> 01:08.920
But there is a free trial option, especially for the first site.

01:08.920 --> 01:11.920
I already went ahead and made an account.

01:11.920 --> 01:16.920
Right here, if you are making the free 10 photos account, I am only going to show you.

01:17.360 --> 01:23.360
Keep in mind that you need 25 pictures, but we are only doing the header one and we will

01:23.360 --> 01:28.360
do 4 more pictures underneath just to show you what the rest is going to look like.

01:28.360 --> 01:32.360
Right here, it will tell you how many assets, so how many pictures you have left to use.

01:32.360 --> 01:37.360
Right here, again, when we are looking for pictures, you want to make sure that you are

01:37.360 --> 01:42.360
looking, especially when you are getting stock photos, that they look not stocky.

01:42.360 --> 01:46.360
You want them to look like you are a local company, you actually took those photos.

01:46.800 --> 01:49.800
Make sure you are familiar with what the area looks like.

01:49.800 --> 01:54.800
Obviously, we are located in St. George, so it is very similar to Arizona.

01:54.800 --> 02:01.800
But I am still going to look at what homes and residential properties look in Queen Creek,

02:01.800 --> 02:06.800
Arizona, which is the area that we are focusing on for our website.

02:06.800 --> 02:11.800
I want to make sure that the images that I am putting on the website look like they are local.

02:12.240 --> 02:17.840
So make sure you are going on Zello or anything like that to look at houses or whatever niche

02:17.840 --> 02:18.840
you are going into.

02:18.840 --> 02:22.840
So, let's start with something more broad.

02:22.840 --> 02:24.840
Concrete driveway.

02:26.840 --> 02:30.840
And keep in mind, you can use any other, you don't have to use Adobe Stock.

02:30.840 --> 02:37.840
If you just go into Google and type free stock images, you will get Shutterstock, which has

02:37.880 --> 02:42.880
some good ones, you will get iStock, Pexels, Unsplash, anything really.

02:42.880 --> 02:47.880
So go ahead and use whatever you want as long as you follow those guidelines that we have

02:47.880 --> 02:50.880
said before.

02:50.880 --> 02:55.880
So, let's see.

03:07.880 --> 03:12.880
The header picture is usually the hardest one because the header picture, you really

03:12.880 --> 03:17.880
need to pick one that is looking good because it is going right here.

03:17.880 --> 03:20.880
So, let's see.

03:26.880 --> 03:29.880
This could be in Arizona.

03:32.880 --> 03:35.880
Ok, let's go ahead and download this.

03:35.920 --> 03:38.920
So, just click on license right here.

03:40.920 --> 03:45.920
Ok, it's going to download it right here.

03:45.920 --> 03:50.920
And if you really like the photo up here, it's actually going to give you some other

03:50.920 --> 03:53.920
ones that are similar.

03:53.920 --> 03:56.920
This could be in Arizona too.

03:56.920 --> 04:01.920
It's not a great driveway, but it may work.

04:01.960 --> 04:10.960
Ok, I think this one is pretty, could be, this looks pretty general.

04:10.960 --> 04:13.960
We have three.

04:13.960 --> 04:20.960
I don't know if I like any of those to be my header photo, so I would like my header

04:20.960 --> 04:21.960
photo.

04:21.960 --> 04:26.960
And your header photo could even be a picture of Queen Creek, like a city or a neighborhood.

04:26.960 --> 04:30.960
Let's see, maybe if we type Queen Creek, Arizona.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
Let's see if they have any good ones.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
Alright.

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
Ok, maybe Arizona.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
Get creative with how you're searching.

04:43.000 --> 04:50.000
Like for example, if you're going into, I don't know, Alabama and you know that in your

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
city that you're going after, there's a lot of brick homes, you can actually just search

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
brick home.

04:55.000 --> 04:59.000
If you know the exact type of house that you're looking for, you can just type that.

04:59.040 --> 05:01.040
This actually looks perfect.

05:01.040 --> 05:05.040
I'm pretty sure there's a stamped concrete.

05:08.040 --> 05:12.040
So, that would actually work.

05:14.040 --> 05:19.040
Let's see, this one would be a good one.

05:19.040 --> 05:22.040
Ok, we already have four.

05:25.040 --> 05:28.040
I think that's stamped concrete.

05:29.040 --> 05:30.040
Um.

05:33.040 --> 05:46.040
But because I'm not sure, just do a quick stamped concrete driveway.

05:46.080 --> 05:52.080
This is when you want to be careful.

05:52.080 --> 06:01.080
Make sure that what you're putting up is exactly what you're looking for.

06:06.080 --> 06:09.080
Ok, yeah, I think that's stamped concrete.

06:09.080 --> 06:13.080
Ok, this would be a really good header photo.

06:13.120 --> 06:18.120
Ok, let's download and we should have all the images that we need.

06:18.120 --> 06:21.120
Ok, let's go back to our website.

06:21.120 --> 06:23.120
There's the header photo right here.

06:23.120 --> 06:25.120
Now we need to optimize the images.

06:25.120 --> 06:29.120
So we need to make them SEO friendly because even images are important when it comes to

06:29.120 --> 06:33.120
ranking, when it comes to optimizing your website to be Google friendly.

06:33.120 --> 06:38.120
So one thing that we want to do is when it comes to optimization of your images, there's

06:38.120 --> 06:39.120
two very important things.

06:39.160 --> 06:41.160
One is resizing the images.

06:41.160 --> 06:43.160
The other one is renaming the images.

06:43.160 --> 06:46.160
See how right now they're called Adobe stock?

06:46.160 --> 06:52.160
Well, nobody that is Googling for your website will see that that photo is called Adobe stock.

06:52.160 --> 06:54.160
Google will and they don't usually like that.

06:54.160 --> 06:59.160
So they want to know exactly what that photo is instead of being an Adobe photo.

06:59.160 --> 07:02.160
And so we're going to rename them.

07:02.160 --> 07:07.160
Now let's, we resize every picture except for the header one.

07:07.200 --> 07:11.200
Usually the header one we don't need to resize because the header picture needs to be at

07:11.200 --> 07:15.200
least 1200 pixels to even look not blurry.

07:15.200 --> 07:20.200
So let's Google a free image resizer.

07:20.200 --> 07:23.200
And again, there are so many options out there.

07:23.200 --> 07:26.200
Just pick one that works for you.

07:26.200 --> 07:27.200
I've used this one before.

07:27.200 --> 07:30.200
A simple image resizer.

07:30.240 --> 07:33.240
So select image.

07:37.240 --> 07:38.240
Download.

07:41.240 --> 07:42.240
Okay.

07:42.240 --> 07:43.240
Let's resize this one.

07:47.240 --> 07:49.240
Usually I want to do it by dimension.

07:52.240 --> 07:57.240
And I would keep them under a thousand pixels.

07:57.280 --> 08:02.280
But usually I like it to do between like 300 and 400.

08:07.280 --> 08:10.280
Let's see, 450.

08:18.280 --> 08:19.280
Okay, that looks silly.

08:19.280 --> 08:23.280
So maybe let's try the percentage because this is not a square picture.

08:23.320 --> 08:28.320
It's hard to make it look natural.

08:28.320 --> 08:31.320
So maybe let's do 30% smaller.

08:31.320 --> 08:32.320
Oops.

08:32.320 --> 08:33.320
We need to select it again.

08:34.320 --> 08:36.320
This one right here.

08:36.360 --> 08:37.360
Okay.

08:51.360 --> 08:53.360
Okay, but we don't really know how many pixels that is.

08:53.360 --> 09:02.360
So let's try different free image resizer.

09:06.360 --> 09:07.360
Okay, let's try this one.

09:10.360 --> 09:11.360
Drop it there.

09:14.360 --> 09:17.360
This should work better because he tells you exactly this is way too much.

09:17.360 --> 09:19.360
So let's make it.

09:22.360 --> 09:23.360
Okay.

09:23.360 --> 09:28.360
And he already tells you this is perfect because you want to keep it max 400

09:28.360 --> 09:31.360
and he already automatically picks a hyphen.

09:31.400 --> 09:34.400
That won't make it look funky.

09:35.400 --> 09:36.400
Let's download the image.

09:38.400 --> 09:39.400
Perfect.

09:39.400 --> 09:41.400
Now I like to open the image immediately.

09:42.400 --> 09:44.400
Now let's go ahead and change the name.

09:44.400 --> 09:46.400
So click here.

09:46.400 --> 09:49.400
And the name of the image really just can be a keyword.

09:49.400 --> 09:53.400
So have your keyword list on hand, whatever you're doing on page SEO

09:53.400 --> 09:56.400
because you're really going to use the keyword list.

09:56.440 --> 10:00.440
So have your keyword list on hand, whatever you're doing on page SEO

10:00.440 --> 10:01.440
because you're really going to use it.

10:01.440 --> 10:05.440
And it's really easy when you have an image pulled up

10:05.440 --> 10:09.440
because all you need to do is look at what the image is and describe it.

10:09.440 --> 10:13.440
So this is a concrete driveway and that is going to be the name of the image.

10:13.440 --> 10:18.440
You can even put the location that you're trying to target.

10:18.440 --> 10:19.440
So Queen Creek.

10:20.440 --> 10:23.440
And I'm going to save this on my desktop.

10:23.440 --> 10:25.440
You can say whatever you want.

10:25.480 --> 10:28.480
Just make sure you know what it is when you need to add it to your website.

10:32.480 --> 10:33.480
Perfect.

10:34.480 --> 10:36.480
Now let's go back

10:39.480 --> 10:42.480
to our images.

10:42.480 --> 10:44.480
Let's do the next one.

10:55.480 --> 10:57.480
OK, 400.

11:06.480 --> 11:08.480
OK, I'm going to name this.

11:08.480 --> 11:13.480
Because the driveway does not look like it's concrete,

11:13.480 --> 11:15.480
but the sidewalk does.

11:15.480 --> 11:19.480
So I'm going to name this concrete sidewalk.

11:25.480 --> 11:26.480
Perfect.

11:26.480 --> 11:28.480
Let's do

11:29.480 --> 11:31.480
let's do another one.

11:33.480 --> 11:35.480
I should do this one.

11:37.480 --> 11:40.480
OK, this could be the concrete walkway.

11:40.480 --> 11:42.480
It looks like it's stamped concrete.

11:43.480 --> 11:46.480
We can even put the cord of concrete.

11:46.520 --> 11:47.520
Image.

11:48.520 --> 11:52.520
Rename it and do not use the same names or the same images.

11:52.520 --> 11:55.520
Always be creative and use a different name for each image.

11:55.520 --> 11:59.520
So, um, the cord of

12:00.520 --> 12:01.520
concrete.

12:06.520 --> 12:09.520
OK, let's do the next one.

12:09.560 --> 12:10.560
Concrete.

12:16.560 --> 12:17.560
Perfect.

12:17.560 --> 12:18.560
And

12:19.560 --> 12:21.560
so far we have three.

12:21.560 --> 12:23.560
OK, we need another small image,

12:23.560 --> 12:25.560
which I believe is this one.

12:25.560 --> 12:29.560
And then we're going to work with our header photo.

12:30.560 --> 12:31.560
Oops.

12:32.560 --> 12:34.560
OK, right here.

12:39.560 --> 12:41.560
OK, let's see.

12:45.560 --> 12:47.560
OK, this one.

12:48.560 --> 12:50.560
And let's do the same thing.

12:50.560 --> 12:52.560
So for 100,

12:52.560 --> 12:54.560
you can even do 300 if you want to be extra safe.

12:54.560 --> 12:57.560
The reason why we make them smaller

12:57.560 --> 12:59.560
is because

12:59.560 --> 13:02.560
if you have very large images, they look very nice,

13:02.560 --> 13:05.560
but the website takes a longer time to load.

13:05.560 --> 13:07.560
And these people are calling themselves

13:07.600 --> 13:08.600
a contractor.

13:08.600 --> 13:09.600
They want things done.

13:09.600 --> 13:11.600
So if if you

13:11.600 --> 13:14.600
I mean, think about the times that you have searched something

13:14.600 --> 13:17.600
on the Internet and the website was really, really slow to load.

13:17.600 --> 13:20.600
You have probably clicked out of it and clicked a different one.

13:20.600 --> 13:23.600
So that's the reason why we want to optimize things

13:23.600 --> 13:26.600
to make the website load fast.

13:28.600 --> 13:32.600
OK, and we can actually name this stamp to concrete.

13:33.600 --> 13:35.600
So let's download

13:35.640 --> 13:37.640
so let's download

13:38.640 --> 13:40.640
rename

13:44.640 --> 13:47.640
stamped concrete.

13:50.640 --> 13:53.640
Make sure you're spelling everything correctly

13:54.640 --> 13:57.640
and don't leave spacers, by the way, when you're renaming.

13:57.640 --> 14:00.640
So how I have a space right here, that won't be good.

14:00.640 --> 14:02.640
So have everything put together.

14:02.680 --> 14:06.680
OK, and now, lastly, we're going to worry about our header photo.

14:07.680 --> 14:10.680
So let's click out of here, select image.

14:10.680 --> 14:11.680
Make sure it's this one.

14:11.680 --> 14:12.680
Awesome.

14:12.680 --> 14:14.680
So it's four point three.

14:14.680 --> 14:15.680
It's a little big.

14:15.680 --> 14:19.680
So I would probably do two thousand.

14:22.680 --> 14:23.680
That should be better.

14:23.680 --> 14:27.680
You can also crop it, but you can do that in Weebly as well.

14:27.680 --> 14:28.680
So let's try it.

14:28.680 --> 14:30.680
If it doesn't work exactly how we want it,

14:30.720 --> 14:32.720
we can always go back here and edit it.

14:32.720 --> 14:37.720
And how I like to name the header photo is usually the company's name,

14:37.720 --> 14:42.720
not the client name, but our company that we have created with this website.

14:42.720 --> 14:49.720
So in my case, that would be Queen Creek Concrete.

14:50.720 --> 14:54.720
OK, I'm going to save this on my desktop where I have all my other ones.

14:54.720 --> 14:56.720
OK, now back to Weebly.

14:56.720 --> 14:57.720
So we have optimized images.

14:57.760 --> 14:58.760
We have resized, renamed.

14:59.760 --> 15:02.760
OK, let's go back to Weebly.

15:02.760 --> 15:04.760
Right here, let's do the header first.

15:04.760 --> 15:05.760
See how that looks.

15:05.760 --> 15:09.760
So you're going to click on replace header layout.

15:09.760 --> 15:10.760
Oops, just kidding.

15:10.760 --> 15:13.760
You're going to click on edit background.

15:13.760 --> 15:17.760
Click out of color, click on image and replace.

15:17.760 --> 15:22.760
OK, upload image, upload a photo from your computer.

15:22.760 --> 15:24.760
OK, right here is our header image.

15:24.800 --> 15:25.800
Let's click on open.

15:31.800 --> 15:32.800
OK, that looks good.

15:32.800 --> 15:37.800
So you can actually, if you hold on to the mouse, you can actually move this around.

15:37.800 --> 15:42.800
I know the house is really nice, but you also want to make sure that people can see the driveway.

15:42.800 --> 15:43.800
So let's keep it that.

15:43.800 --> 15:46.800
Click save usually gets a little bigger.

15:46.800 --> 15:47.800
Perfect.

15:47.800 --> 15:52.800
So you can, if you click here, this little dot, you can make it larger.

15:52.840 --> 15:53.840
OK, that should work.

15:53.840 --> 15:55.840
I think there's a space here.

15:55.840 --> 15:56.840
There's not.

15:56.840 --> 15:59.840
OK, let's go ahead and add our phone number here.

15:59.840 --> 16:04.840
What we like to do, if you have a very colorful image, sometimes it's hard to read.

16:04.840 --> 16:06.840
So we like to do something.

16:06.840 --> 16:10.840
Whatever we have done right here with the color block, we put in the header.

16:10.840 --> 16:18.840
So go ahead and add that up here and let's drag the title in here and the phone number.

16:18.880 --> 16:21.880
OK, let's actually add the company's phone number.

16:21.880 --> 16:23.880
So go ahead and copy that.

16:23.880 --> 16:30.880
Either go on call real, make sure that everything is very detail oriented.

16:30.880 --> 16:35.880
So make sure the phone number double, triple check that it's the exact one that you want

16:35.880 --> 16:36.880
it to be.

16:36.880 --> 16:42.880
Make sure that it's linked to a click to call to the same phone number so people can actually

16:42.880 --> 16:43.880
click and call.

16:43.880 --> 16:45.880
Let's make this smaller.

16:45.920 --> 16:46.920
A little bigger.

16:46.920 --> 16:47.920
All right.

16:47.920 --> 16:50.920
We don't need the color block to be that big.

16:50.920 --> 16:54.920
And Weebly doesn't allow you to make things skinnier.

16:54.920 --> 17:02.920
So a trick to doing by doing that is to put a spacer outside the color block and see how

17:02.920 --> 17:07.920
now you can make it more skinny to fit in there.

17:07.920 --> 17:12.920
So put it outside of the color block and you can actually fix it to fit in there.

17:12.960 --> 17:21.960
And then we can make the color block less of a block by clicking on it under background

17:21.960 --> 17:22.960
transparency.

17:22.960 --> 17:28.960
You can make this less so you can actually still see through the picture behind it.

17:28.960 --> 17:33.960
But it's you can see the letters more and you can make the color block like you can

17:33.960 --> 17:34.960
round the corners.

17:34.960 --> 17:35.960
This is up to you.

17:35.960 --> 17:39.960
I like to round them a little bit so it's not so harsh, but you can do whatever you

17:39.960 --> 17:40.960
want.

17:41.000 --> 17:45.000
And then I usually like to put a divider in between so I have a nice line.

17:47.000 --> 17:52.000
OK, let's make see what this looks like on the mobile.

17:55.000 --> 17:59.000
OK, I don't love I usually like everything to be in a line.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
So just switch things up.

18:01.000 --> 18:06.000
If you see this, just go into the theme, change the fonts to make something that looks

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
better and more aligned.

18:08.040 --> 18:15.040
OK, and now you can also I'm pretty sure if we put a spacer above, it should screen.

18:15.040 --> 18:17.040
No, that won't work that way.

18:17.040 --> 18:19.040
So let's get rid of that.

18:20.040 --> 18:22.040
OK, let's see.

18:22.040 --> 18:25.040
Let's make this a different color.

18:30.040 --> 18:33.040
OK, that looks better.

18:33.080 --> 18:35.080
OK, that looks better.

18:35.080 --> 18:38.080
And then let's change this to be.

18:46.080 --> 18:51.080
OK, let's change the and now that we know what the header looks like, it's easier to

18:51.080 --> 18:53.080
make a form for it.

18:53.080 --> 18:59.080
So we can even do you can round the corners of the form as well.

18:59.120 --> 19:00.120
OK.

19:05.120 --> 19:09.120
Let's do let's just see what a yellow would look like.

19:09.120 --> 19:11.120
Don't really like that yellow.

19:11.120 --> 19:14.120
So let's grab.

19:20.120 --> 19:22.120
Maybe we just need to do a gray.

19:23.120 --> 19:27.120
OK, now that it's really hard to see the font.

19:27.160 --> 19:28.160
This is a little annoying.

19:28.160 --> 19:32.160
Whenever you're going with a dark color in the form, you just have to click on theme,

19:32.160 --> 19:35.160
click on fonts and then paragraph text.

19:35.160 --> 19:39.160
You're going to have to make that white and then it's going to be invisible here.

19:39.160 --> 19:41.160
So you have to manually make that black.

19:41.160 --> 19:43.160
But that's OK.

19:43.160 --> 19:45.160
I don't love.

19:47.160 --> 19:48.160
That.

19:50.160 --> 19:53.160
Don't love you, neither of them.

19:53.200 --> 19:56.200
OK, we want to make this white.

19:57.200 --> 19:59.200
You can actually see it.

19:59.200 --> 20:01.200
You probably want to make this yellow.

20:02.200 --> 20:04.200
Like the phone number.

20:06.200 --> 20:10.200
And obviously, this is not I mean, there's no rule in this.

20:10.200 --> 20:13.200
It's whatever you think looks decent.

20:13.200 --> 20:15.200
I would probably go with it.

20:15.240 --> 20:16.240
There.

20:16.240 --> 20:20.240
You can also make the form like a little smaller.

20:20.240 --> 20:22.240
I feel like that looks better.

20:22.240 --> 20:25.240
OK, now let's highlight every piece of content.

20:25.240 --> 20:29.240
Make sure and this is can be annoying.

20:30.240 --> 20:33.240
But it's important that you are paying attention to the font.

20:33.240 --> 20:35.240
You can also make the font smaller.

20:35.240 --> 20:37.240
I feel like that looks better.

20:37.240 --> 20:40.240
OK, now let's highlight every piece of content.

20:40.240 --> 20:43.240
Make sure and this is can be annoying.

20:43.280 --> 20:46.280
But it's important that you are paying attention to.

20:46.280 --> 20:48.280
This is already black.

20:48.280 --> 20:50.280
OK, so the rest of the content is good to go.

20:50.280 --> 20:53.280
Now, let's add the corner image right here.

20:53.280 --> 20:54.280
So just click on here.

20:54.280 --> 20:58.280
Upload a photo from your computer and.

20:59.280 --> 21:01.280
Let's do this one.

21:03.280 --> 21:09.280
I don't know if you remember when we were putting this into the desktop

21:09.280 --> 21:11.280
into the mobile phone.

21:11.320 --> 21:15.320
Look, this content would actually be disappearing.

21:15.320 --> 21:21.320
So well, when you add an image, as I said, in the module in the second

21:21.320 --> 21:23.320
module, this comes back.

21:23.320 --> 21:29.320
So OK, go back to desktop and you're going to do the same down here

21:29.320 --> 21:32.320
with the other three images that we downloaded.

21:32.360 --> 21:33.360
So one.

21:37.360 --> 21:38.360
Two.

21:40.360 --> 21:41.360
Three.

21:49.360 --> 21:52.360
All right, make sure the pictures are looking good.

21:52.360 --> 21:55.360
One thing that I like to do, and this is totally up to you, just giving

21:55.360 --> 21:57.360
you ideas where the pictures are.

21:57.360 --> 21:59.360
You can put it like a dark gray.

21:59.360 --> 22:01.360
You can match the same dark gray as the quote form.

22:02.360 --> 22:05.360
And then one last thing you need to do to optimize your images

22:05.360 --> 22:08.360
to be SEO friendly is click on the image right here.

22:08.360 --> 22:13.360
Go all the way to advanced and make sure you have an alt text.

22:13.360 --> 22:17.360
An alt text is pretty much another description of what the image is.

22:17.360 --> 22:20.360
So I'm pretty sure if you are.

22:21.360 --> 22:24.360
Like have some kind of disability and you can't see the image,

22:24.360 --> 22:27.360
there is a way that you can see the description of the image.

22:27.360 --> 22:31.360
And that's what the alt text is also used for is for people to identify

22:31.400 --> 22:32.400
whatever is on the image.

22:32.400 --> 22:34.400
So just be descriptive about it.

22:34.400 --> 22:38.400
For example, this could be stamped.

22:40.400 --> 22:43.400
Concrete for house.

22:44.400 --> 22:45.400
Walkway.

22:46.400 --> 22:50.400
And you're going to do this for these three images

22:50.400 --> 22:52.400
and all the other images as well.

22:52.400 --> 22:56.400
And then make sure you're always publishing after you're done.

22:56.440 --> 22:59.440
And that's all you have to do.

22:59.440 --> 23:04.440
So do that for all 25 images and you're good to go.
