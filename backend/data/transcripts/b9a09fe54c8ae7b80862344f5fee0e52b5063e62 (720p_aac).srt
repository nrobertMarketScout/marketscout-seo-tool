1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Okay, guys, welcome to call. I'm gonna get started. It's night after the hour. It is January 28, 2025. We're almost a month into this. You guys set goals to be at whatever by by Christmas or new the last day of 2025. You're already a month into this thing. We've already got a month gone. That means that whatever you were supposed to hit in Q1, you are now one third of the way

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:59,960
done. That's going to be exciting for some of you. It's going to be painful for others. But whatever the case is, we have a month gone. Anyway, it's shocking. I literally felt like New Year's was yesterday. That's crazy. Okay. Three things. Number one, rank and run engine. If you are new, quickly rank and run engine is our go to tool for this business. If you are outside the US, do not worry. We are working on rolling this out into different countries starting with the

3
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:29,960
pot, the the most densely populated countries for students inside this group, Australia, Canada, UK, etc, etc, etc, going from there. We are working on that. If you are outside the US and you're like, oh my gosh, I don't know how to do this without. Yeah, you can. Okay, ever. I was able to scale this thing using a bunch of tools cobbled together. It's not ideal, but it's doable. We have you in mind. We're working on it. If you're in the US and you're not using the tool that's on you. It's it's extremely, extremely, extremely, extremely

4
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:59,960
easy to manage everything one place, do your due diligence and just scale this business. Okay. What I want to say, the reason I'm bringing up ranking engine is I think I made this announcement last. No, I made the post last week, but I didn't make the announcement because by the way, last week guys, thanks to Porter and Jason, or maybe it's just border. I can't remember. I think it was both of them. They went live and in my place. I was actually traveling last Tuesday from Africa to Dubai, but here I am. What I want to say

5
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:29,960
though is our backlink analyzer tool is live. Okay. So for those of you guys that are paying for three to four tools, paying for majestic and paying for eight, eight trusts and paying for mangles and paying for a SEM rush and paying for a sauna and whatever. Stop. Okay. You're wasting money. You're wasting, uh, whatever you're wasting resources, but more importantly, you're wasting your attention. Right. You're, I remember trying to track down

6
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:59,960
stuff. Where's this document? Where's that sheet? Just make it easy guys. You can't put a price tag on convenience. You can't put a price tag on the time that you're saving. Um, all I wanted to do is give a shout out to Ryan. I went through the tool when he first launched it. And I very quickly was like, Hey, this tool is amazing. I love it. It's one place. It's simple. It's clean. It doesn't have all the extra crap. However, it's missing in the central component, which is the backlink analyzer. That was about six weeks ago when I told him this in six weeks, he

7
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:29,960
took my information. He took what I said to him. He designed it with the developers, took it to the developers, put it on a staging platform, took it into production. And it's already live within six weeks. That is the beauty of having this tool that we have in the group, because anything that we see, Hey, um, we need to add this. We need to change this. We need to get rid of this. We get to build it as we go. So the cool part is that's just version one of the backlink analyzer. And right now you'll notice in the backlink analyzer, you can look at the root

8
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:59,960
domain. We're going to be adding other ways, looking at the URL, the view from the URL, looking at the path view, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Some of you guys have no idea what I'm talking about. We're going to get into that more and more. Don't worry. Um, that tool is going to get beefed up. That's an individual tool inside of Rank Your Engine. Okay. All I want to say, if you guys get a chance, give Ryan a shout out. He got that thing done in six weeks. Um, you would never even be able to get stuff done with another company because they wouldn't care. And he was able to get that done in six weeks. And it is phenomenal. So guys go check that out.

9
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:29,960
If you already have an account, just go log into your account on the left-hand side at the bottom. It's the second one from the bottom and it's the backlink analyzer. Go in there, throw in your root domain and go and check out all the statistics, the trust flow, the citation flow, the referring domains, referring IPs, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Okay. Um, by the way, guys, we're, me and Ryan are going to be doing a proper training on how to use the backlink analyzer tool within Rank Your Engine.

10
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:59,960
We'll be here in the next few weeks, if not this week or next week, next Tuesday. So keep an eye out for that. Um, just so you guys know. Okay. And then again, I'm going to just drop this in the chat. For those of you that are wondering, do not have anything. I'm going to try to do this on my computer, see if it works. Here is the code. This is the code for the, uh, discount for Rank Your Engine. Okay.

11
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:12,960
Cool. I spent some time in there playing around with it. Just literally, even just today. So go check that out guys. RankYourEngine.com. I just dropped the code. You guys can go check that out. Um, last two things really quick.

12
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:28,960
Number one, I mentioned this two weeks ago, but guys, January is one of the best times of the year to get deals. When I talked about this two weeks ago, I literally told you guys, I was like, Hey, I have a business owner that I reached out to.

13
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:38,960
Literally this morning. And then if you guys remember at the end of the call, I picked up my phone. I had a response to that business owner. A couple of days later, I did a live with the business owner. I think it was like two days later.

14
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:50,960
I did a Zoom call. I'm sorry, with the business owner. And we, I basically said to them, Hey, I know we, things didn't work out in the past. We made some adjustments. Let me and Francesca look at the area you want to target.

15
00:05:51,960 --> 00:06:02,960
Come up with a proposal and do a three month deal where you work with us for three months with the intention that at the end of the three months, we can work together for another six months to a year.

16
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:11,960
So we got this thing all teed up. We went in, we did the homework. When I say we, Francesca did all the homework and we have given them a proposal and we are supposed to hop on the phone later this week.

17
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:22,960
Just giving you guys an update. Reach out to those people that you reached out to back in January or back in July that were too busy, too fat and happy. July, August, September, October.

18
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:35,960
Reach out to them. Be a, I won't even say apologetic. Be a human and say, Hey, just wanted to circle back around. And you can tell me to go, I think the thing that I said, you can tell me to go and eat sand at any point.

19
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:44,960
But I do know that there's something we could work together on. If you're willing, I'd love to revisit this conversation, see what we could do and see if there's a way we work together again.

20
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:59,960
That's such an easy thing to say yes to. Okay. Reach out. January is a phenomenal time to get deals because there's something that clicks in people's brains between December 14th to 31st and January 1 to January 31st.

21
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:08,960
I don't know what it is. I can't explain it, but something changes inside of people. Okay. Reach out. It takes a second. It takes a little bit of hustle, takes a little bit of sweat and you're done. Okay.

22
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:23,960
Last thing I want to cover really quick is 3.0. It is coming along very nicely. I spent an hour on Monday. I spent an hour today. I'm spending one to one and a half hours per day working on the 3.0 version, working on auditing 2.0.

23
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:31,960
What can we get rid of? How can we make it shorter? How can we make it more to the point? What do we need to add? What, you know, all kinds of different stuff.

24
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:41,960
So I just want you to know that is in the works. It will be out before the end of quarter two. Sorry, end of quarter one before the start of quarter two.

25
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:52,960
Do not think there is something that you're missing in version 2.0 that version 3.0 is magically going to have that's going to make you millions of dollars by you not doing anything different.

26
00:07:52,960 --> 00:08:07,960
Okay. Ninety five percent of the content is going to be the exact same. We are just going to be changing the way it is delivered and presented and the way you are going to consume it, which I think is going to radically change and help with the success of the students in this group.

27
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:14,960
We're going to be adding some stuff, taking some stuff away, but I don't want anyone sitting here, but I'm going to wait for 3.0. That is a stupid strategy. Go make some freaking money today.

28
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:25,960
Get ready, get excited for it. I am working on it at this point almost daily and looking super excited to releasing that for you guys. Okay, so that's it, guys. I'm going to bring on Zach Powell.

29
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:42,960
I think I'm going to intro Zach before I bring him on because it's always a little bit better for me to do it without embarrassing him. I am going to turn on the AC. You guys are going to give me about 10 seconds because I'm so hot in his office. Give me one second.

30
00:08:44,960 --> 00:09:12,960
All right, guys, quick intro on Zach Powell. If you guys haven't listened to any of the trainings that we actually should probably check really quick to make sure you guys consider me. I can't see any comments, by the way.

31
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:27,960
I'm just kind of doing this off the seat of my pants. Okay, there we go. Let's see if I can see anything. People can still hear me. Let's see. Okay, I think we're still good.

32
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:43,960
11 minutes ago. If you guys can still hear me, I just have to keep canceling or deleting the app or killing it and bring it back on. But anyway, let me give you guys a quick intro on Zach and then Zach, he's in the waiting room. I'm going to be bringing him along with somebody that he's actually worked with personally.

33
00:09:43,960 --> 00:10:06,960
Zach Powell is a, he's actually a member of this group. He's a student in here as of I think it was back in 2022 when he joined. But Zach, when he started, he was in a position where he needed to replace his income very rapidly. He had a job, we're going to get into his story, whatever.

34
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:19,960
He had a job that he needed to replace that income. He had like a severance or something, a few months worth. He's like, I got to replace my income by this date so I can keep doing this thing and my wife's not going to let me. Okay. And so he already bought a program.

35
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:34,960
And I think he bought one a year before that he purchased this one. And he looked at it and he's like, dude, the quickest way for me to be able to get out of my job to be able to replace that income is going to be through SEO. Okay.

36
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:48,960
Now, when I say SEO, I'm talking about taking the website, ranking it at the top of Google and doing it like as a, as a service. Okay. Not doing it where it's on your website, but doing it as a service for a client.

37
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:57,960
I used to be very, very against this because I tried to do this. It was actually what I tried to do to replace my income when I quit my door-to-door sales job.

38
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:07,960
But I did it incorrectly. I was targeting the wrong niches. I was going for the wrong type of deals. I was talking to the wrong type of people, but Zach did it in a very smart way.

39
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:16,960
He does it in this really smart, predictable way that he can literally, he's got this thing on autopilot and he's got actually has other people closing deals for him.

40
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:22,960
And so he's like just the puppet master behind the scenes that's pulling the strings. Okay.

41
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:30,960
And he does it in such a way that he perfectly tees these clients up to go and then sell digital assets to them that he builds.

42
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:42,960
He's making over 50k a month. He just barely built this brand new house for his family that he also uses and kind of like doubles as a office for his employees.

43
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:46,960
And you're probably going to see the background and everything. He used to be in an office and now he does that.

44
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:52,960
But on top of that, guys, he's one of the most humble dudes I know. He's a family guy and he's literally living the life of his dreams.

45
00:11:52,960 --> 00:12:00,960
He's surfing or mountain biking in a new country. It seems like almost every week. It's probably more like every month or every month, but he's living the life that you want to live.

46
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:10,960
I think it's really cool. So today, Zach is going to be teaching us and he's going to be talking about this as someone that's doing over 50k a month, how to become a $50,000 per month sales monster.

47
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:16,960
And I'm just going to be over here enjoying. I don't even have questions prepared because Zach hasn't prepared.

48
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,960
But as questions come, I'm going to be asking if you guys have questions, I want you to drop them.

49
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:29,960
Just know this guy has my stamp of approval and I don't let a whole lot of people have any kind of a platform inside of this group because I don't trust a lot of people.

50
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,960
This is somebody that I actually trust. So I'll be bringing Zach on.

51
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:39,960
And I'm also going to be bringing on Vinny, who is also ironically a student of this program in digital landlords.

52
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:45,960
He joined back in 2022 as well. Zach helped him and showed him how to do what he did.

53
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:52,960
And Vinny has also has also replaced his income and is making a lot of money doing these very simple SEO deals.

54
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:57,960
OK, so let me bring these guys in really quick. Get your questions ready and let's get into this right now.

55
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:11,960
Zach Powell.

56
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:17,960
Hey, Nick. Hey, Vinny. How's it going, guys? What's up? Oh, Vinny, there you are, bro. Can you hear me?

57
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:22,960
I hear you. How's it going, Nick? It's going great. I'm going to give. Good to see you, bro. It's been a minute.

58
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:28,960
Good to see you, Vinny. Zach, I see you a lot. Vinny, I haven't seen you in a minute. Good to see you, dude. It's been a while. Yeah, you too.

59
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:33,960
So real quick, I'm going to give Zach co-host just because of my Internet glitches.

60
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:37,960
Then, Zach, you can keep going. I'll jump back on. I don't know. I have Internet troubles.

61
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:42,960
It's it's wild here in Dubai, which you'd never think would be the case.

62
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:48,960
So anyway, Zach, welcome to Call Dude from tuning in from Queen Creek, Arizona.

63
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:55,960
And Vinny, tell everyone where you're at right now. I'm right next to Zach. I'm in Gilbert, Arizona.

64
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,960
Have you always been there or did you move there recently?

65
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,960
No, I moved here about two years ago.

66
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:08,960
Did you move there after you started working with Zach or before?

67
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:14,960
So I actually first met Zach like a year before I moved here officially.

68
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:18,960
I was here visiting and we met up and then I moved later.

69
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:22,960
I love it, dude. It's a great area. It's a it's a cool area.

70
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:29,960
Yeah, I'll take the heat all day over the snow. So I get the drop.

71
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:35,960
Zach, I gave you an intro. Vinny, maybe you can just kind of and I don't know if you guys are on,

72
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,960
but Vinny was a member of and is a member of Digital Landlords.

73
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:43,960
He also started working with Zach. Zach started kind of mentoring him on what he does

74
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:48,960
and landing these very simple SEO deals and was able to scale his agency up.

75
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,960
And Vinny, not to put you on the spot, but maybe you can let everyone know

76
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:58,960
kind of where your agency sits right now in terms of revenue just to give some context.

77
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:06,960
Yeah, I'm at about forty four thousand monthly recurring right now.

78
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:10,960
Most of that is directly due to both of you guys.

79
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,960
Yeah, bro. Forty four thousand per month. That's insane, dude.

80
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,960
Last time I talked to you, you're making like eight or something like that.

81
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:21,960
Zach, what are you at right now per month?

82
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,960
We're at fifty eight.

83
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:29,960
Fifty eight. So Vinny's biting at the heels, dude. Let's go. He's coming.

84
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:33,960
I know. He's coming for me. It's awesome. I love seeing it.

85
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:37,960
What a lot of people don't know because I've had people like, for example,

86
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,960
Ryan Dalton, he's he went up to eighty seven K like two years.

87
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:45,960
It's actually the biggest flex ever is when somebody that you've helped makes crazy money.

88
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,960
It's not intimidating or threatening. It's like the best.

89
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:52,960
It's like when your kid scores a basket, you know, in bad years, just balls.

90
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:57,960
So I'm like, hey, it works. It works. Keep doing it. It works.

91
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,960
It's 100 percent, man. So it's going to be exciting.

92
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,960
It's going to be exciting. So we have between the three of us,

93
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,960
we're making a fair amount of money doing a very simple thing on the Internet.

94
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:11,960
Now, Zach and Vinny are there.

95
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:16,960
They're working with clients in a very strategic way where they manage their SEO, their websites.

96
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:20,960
They've got it. They've got it really dialed in where they don't have to do a whole bunch of,

97
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,960
you know, back and forth. We'll talk more about that.

98
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,960
We've talked about that in their lives. We're going to keep this mainly on sales.

99
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:31,960
I'm obviously doing the same thing, but on my own websites.

100
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,960
OK, the thing I like about what you guys are doing, though,

101
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:39,960
and the reason why I've always kind of giving you a stamp of approval, Zach and Vinny,

102
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:44,960
is because you guys are doing it in a very strategic and smart way.

103
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,960
When I was doing SEO, I was just going for big clients.

104
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:51,960
I was going for the big, juicy four thousand dollar per month, high maintenance,

105
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,960
you know, prima donna clients, and it just didn't work.

106
00:16:54,960 --> 00:17:00,960
And it was terrible. You guys are building these brick by brick businesses.

107
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,960
I bet you your forty four thousand dollars, for example, Vinny,

108
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:08,960
is spread out in such a way that if you lost a client today, you're not going to lose sleep.

109
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,960
Am I wrong on that or is that pretty accurate?

110
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,960
That's exactly right. Yeah. Yeah, I love that.

111
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:19,960
So I've talked enough. I want to turn the time over to Zach, Vinny. I'll chime in.

112
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,960
It was questions, but I'm going to shut my mouth.

113
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:26,960
You guys are the ones that are combining right now for over one hundred thousand dollars per month,

114
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:33,960
doing just basic, simple five hundred, three hundred, six hundred dollar a month

115
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,960
SEO deals with business owners. So you guys are doing a lot of deals.

116
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,960
Let's talk about how to become a sales monster. Fifty thousand dollars per month sales monster.

117
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,960
Awesome, man. Yeah, thanks for bringing me out. Appreciate it.

118
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:50,960
So I think real quick, I'll just talk about like what Vinny and I have done

119
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,960
and then we'll talk about how to become a sales monster and sales beast.

120
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:03,960
So essentially, you know, I started with Legion and it was tough for me.

121
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,960
And I was like getting all these easy opportunities to win SEO deals.

122
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,960
My dad's a carpet cleaner. So I was like, sure, I'll do your website, dad.

123
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,960
And then his friends and they just started stacking up and I saw the route to quit my job,

124
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,960
which was my main goal. And so I just kept taking all these SEO clients

125
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:27,960
and systemized it where it was just like stacking easy wins, easy wins, easy wins.

126
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,960
And so Vinny has done the same model and has crushed it.

127
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,960
There's more info. I'll just throw it in the chat if you want to check out.

128
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:40,960
I like showing my strike page and stuff. ZachPowell.co.

129
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,960
There's super basic landing page, has like my strike page, tells my story.

130
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:51,960
Check it out if you want. But I guess Vinny, if you. Cool.

131
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:56,960
And then Vinny, if you want to kind of tell about your journey of like Legion,

132
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,960
what appealed with SEO, what you did, how it helped you scale, that'd be great.

133
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,960
And then I can go into like some sales training that I prepared.

134
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:10,960
So you have any thoughts on, I guess, the Grow SEO program or like how it helped you

135
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,960
being in digital landlords and being in Grow SEO and kind of your thoughts on that?

136
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:21,960
Yeah, yeah, for sure. So, you know, getting started like you in Legion,

137
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:26,960
obviously it takes time to kind of start ranking these sites and then you can rent them out.

138
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:33,960
And then Nick comes along and teaches like to speed that up with the ads, which works great.

139
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:38,960
I landed some awesome clients that way. It is kind of expensive, right?

140
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:45,960
To get going. And then you kind of introduced me to focusing more on SEO,

141
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:50,960
which doesn't really take much expense or time.

142
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,960
You can just come in and you start working on the client site right away.

143
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:00,960
You know, they're paying you from day one, regardless of where the site is ranking.

144
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:09,960
So it was just a good way for me to kind of start building my client base quickly and with little overhead.

145
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:16,960
So I really kind of hit that hard after I saw the first few deals come through and it was going smooth.

146
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:23,960
And the rest is history. Great, great coaching program.

147
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:28,960
I've learned so much from you, from both of you guys.

148
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,960
You know, as far as SEO and selling more than anything, you got to be able to sell.

149
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:37,960
And that's what I've learned. Like until you have a sale, you don't have a business.

150
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:44,960
So there have been many times where I've sold something before I even knew how I was going to deliver.

151
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:51,960
And like, that's OK. You know, if you're committed to delivering, then get the sale and then you figure it out.

152
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,960
So that's been my biggest takeaway from both of you guys.

153
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,960
Just get the sale and then move forward.

154
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,960
Does that kind of cover what you wanted, Zach?

155
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,960
Anything else? Yeah, man, that's awesome.

156
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:07,960
Yeah, I love what you said about sales, too, because sales is like that foundation.

157
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,960
When you have those confidence and knowledge, you'll just go crush it.

158
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:16,960
So I'll prepare some thoughts on that today.

159
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,960
Usually I share my screen on my iPad, but I'm just going old school with some paper today.

160
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,960
We're going to talk about being a sales beast.

161
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,960
So first thing to talk about.

162
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,960
Let me do this quick, Zach. Let me try to unshare or let me.

163
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:35,960
I'm seeing in the chat somebody said, I can't see you.

164
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,960
And I don't know why that is.

165
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,960
Porter says, I can't see you and hear bits and pieces.

166
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,960
I can hear you guys. Can you guys hear me?

167
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,960
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

168
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:54,960
Maybe whoever else is on, maybe Porter needs to get out of the freaking jungle wherever he's at

169
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,960
and get off the track and watch this on some actual Wi-Fi.

170
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,960
That could be part of the problem.

171
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,960
But just in case it's not just a Porter problem.

172
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,960
Just kidding, Porter.

173
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,960
Can anyone else confirm that you can hear us before Zach gets into this?

174
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,960
So that I'm not being the only ones getting this training.

175
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,960
It might be good for us to check it out.

176
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,960
If you can hear us, let me know.

177
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,960
If you can see us, let me know.

178
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,960
By the way, I have to keep killing my app and then refreshing.

179
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:25,960
My Facebook lives are probably the worst thing that's ever happened, but also convenient.

180
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,960
So let's see here.

181
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,960
So Kevin says he can only see me.

182
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,960
We can hear, just not see you.

183
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,960
You guys can see me though, right?

184
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,960
Yeah, I can see all three of us.

185
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:44,960
Let me take off the...

186
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,960
That's so wild, dude.

187
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,960
We're just voices in Nick's head right now.

188
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,960
That's crazy.

189
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,960
Okay, well, only see you, Nick Wood.

190
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,960
That's wild, dude.

191
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,960
That's wild.

192
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:58,960
Okay, let me try to get one more thing.

193
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,960
Hold on.

194
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:04,960
I'm going to remove spotlight from me, remove spotlight from you.

195
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,960
And then there's three of us.

196
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,960
Okay, let's see if that works because I did the spotlight thing.

197
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,960
One more time.

198
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,960
Can you guys see us?

199
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,960
Can you guys hear us?

200
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,960
Before we continue here.

201
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,960
Let's see.

202
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,960
Sorry about that, guys.

203
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,960
The game here.

204
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,960
So Jason, I read last comments that we can hear, just not see you.

205
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,960
By the way, Zach and Vinny, can you guys see the comments coming in real time?

206
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,960
I can't.

207
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,960
I can't, yeah.

208
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,960
I'm Facebook.

209
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,960
I don't have it pulled up.

210
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,960
Okay.

211
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,960
Zach, as soon as you get a confirmation, I'm going to have to keep killing the app.

212
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,960
I can't even see anything in real time.

213
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,960
If anyone confirms they can see us now, then we can move forward.

214
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:54,960
The last comment I see is from Jason.

215
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,960
Yeah, everyone is just saying they just see you.

216
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,960
But they can hear us.

217
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,960
I mean, I'm fine to just talk it out and they can look at you smiling if they want.

218
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,960
You know what I can try to do, brother, is you have co-hosts.

219
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:08,960
So here's what I'm going to do.

220
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,960
I'm going to hop off.

221
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,960
You just start your thing and then you just let me in.

222
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:17,960
And let's see if that solves the problem.

223
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,960
I'm good.

224
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,960
I'm actually going to make you host, not just co-host.

225
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,960
Let me try that really quick.

226
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,960
See if that solves the problem.

227
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,960
One more time, guys.

228
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,960
Can you see Zach now?

229
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,960
Because it says I'm the host, or it says Zach's the host.

230
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,960
If they can't, I'm going to just hop off.

231
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:36,960
You guys just start going and then I'll hop on and see if it'll keep it on you.

232
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,960
Because you're going to be the one doing the primarily talking.

233
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:44,960
Any other comments in there?

234
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,960
Still just you that they can see.

235
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,960
Okay, I'm going to hop off.

236
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,960
You just get going, Zach.

237
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,960
Obviously, if I hop off, they're going to have to see somebody.

238
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,960
So they have to see you.

239
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,960
If it goes black, let me know.

240
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,960
I'll hop right back on.

241
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,960
Just let me back in here in a second, okay?

242
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,960
Sounds great.

243
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:59,960
Great.

244
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,960
Actually, you know what, Zach?

245
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,960
You better start.

246
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:06,960
Can you push record, please, so we can record it on your end?

247
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,960
Oh, yeah.

248
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,960
Record to the cloud.

249
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:15,960
Here we go.

250
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:20,960
It says I can't record to the cloud here.

251
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,960
Can you record to your computer?

252
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:24,960
Yeah, I can do that.

253
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,960
Let's see.

254
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,960
Record to this computer.

255
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,960
That worked.

256
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,960
Recording.

257
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,960
Here we go.

258
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,960
All right.

259
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,960
Sounds good.

260
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,960
I'm going to hop off.

261
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:34,960
See you in a second, guys.

262
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,960
All right.
