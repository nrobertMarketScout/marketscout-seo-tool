00:00.000 --> 00:13.240
Guys, I've already talked about this, but I want to talk about the questions and the

00:13.240 --> 00:15.840
information that we push off until later.

00:15.840 --> 00:20.680
There are a couple pieces of questions or a couple pieces of information that there's

00:20.680 --> 00:23.400
a time and a place, and I want to go over those really briefly.

00:23.400 --> 00:26.200
I've already talked about this, so I don't want to take too much time, but there's two

00:26.200 --> 00:27.200
things.

00:27.200 --> 00:30.720
As you start doing this live transfer process and you're calling them in between, you're

00:30.720 --> 00:33.920
texting them in between, you're starting to build this relationship, they're going to

00:33.920 --> 00:35.840
get comfortable with you and they're going to go...

00:35.840 --> 00:38.920
Some of these guys are going to say, some of these ladies are going to say, hey, tell

00:38.920 --> 00:42.000
me how much is this going to cost?

00:42.000 --> 00:43.680
Just shoot me straight, man.

00:43.680 --> 00:45.160
I'm a no BS kind of guy.

00:45.160 --> 00:50.480
I'm a no BS kind of lady, and they're going to ask you, how does this work?

00:50.480 --> 00:52.320
There are two things that you want to push off.

00:52.320 --> 00:55.360
Number one is price and number two is deal structure because they're the two things that

00:55.360 --> 00:56.360
can scare people.

00:56.360 --> 00:59.280
I do not share either of those until the proper time.

00:59.280 --> 01:01.240
I don't share the price until the final call.

01:01.240 --> 01:04.840
I don't share the deal structure until the screencast, which is going to be in the next

01:04.840 --> 01:07.280
module.

01:07.280 --> 01:11.040
If these keep coming up, just keep letting them know, hey, I don't want to put the cart

01:11.040 --> 01:12.040
before the horse.

01:12.040 --> 01:13.840
We'll deal with that later.

01:13.840 --> 01:17.520
Let me just get you a couple more leads and we can talk about it, but I'm very flexible.

01:17.520 --> 01:18.760
Just so you know, I'm really creative.

01:18.760 --> 01:19.880
I own this company.

01:19.880 --> 01:20.880
It's on me.

01:20.880 --> 01:21.960
I get to decide.

01:21.960 --> 01:22.960
That's my go-to.

01:22.960 --> 01:23.960
Nice.

01:23.960 --> 01:26.240
I've mentioned this before, but if somebody keeps hitting you on price, price, price,

01:26.240 --> 01:28.920
price, price, and it gets to the point where it's like, they're going to need no price,

01:28.920 --> 01:32.600
just say, hey, just to be honest with you, Mr. Business Owner, Mr. Business Owner, I

01:32.600 --> 01:35.400
have customers that are paying me three to 500 bucks a month and I have somebody that's

01:35.400 --> 01:37.400
paying me 20, 30K a month.

01:37.400 --> 01:38.400
It's going to be somewhere in between.

01:38.400 --> 01:39.400
Ha, ha, ha.

01:39.400 --> 01:44.520
No, but seriously, obviously it'll be way closer to the bottom than the top, but it's

01:44.520 --> 01:45.520
a huge range.

01:45.520 --> 01:46.520
There's a lot of factors.

01:46.520 --> 01:50.600
I don't want to get too deep into that until we found out that this is actually a good

01:50.600 --> 01:51.600
fit.

01:51.600 --> 01:52.600
Okay?

01:53.240 --> 01:54.240
This is something to satisfy them and move on.

01:54.240 --> 01:55.240
That's it.

01:55.240 --> 01:57.520
That's what I say if they keep hitting me on price.

01:57.520 --> 02:01.240
Those two things, the deal structure, and this is something you're going to get a lot

02:01.240 --> 02:05.000
as people are going to keep saying, and they're going to be trying to hedge their bet.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.840
They're going to go, yeah, man, this is cool.

02:06.840 --> 02:10.760
I'm just going to raise my prices and I'm going to give you 10% or, hey, this is going

02:10.760 --> 02:11.760
to work out really well.

02:11.760 --> 02:12.940
I'm just going to give you a percentage.

02:12.940 --> 02:15.720
It's going to start to get to your head because you're going to think, man, how am I ever

02:15.720 --> 02:18.520
going to sell this person on a flat fee deal?

02:18.520 --> 02:19.580
Don't let it get to your head.

02:19.580 --> 02:20.580
Don't get flustered.

02:20.580 --> 02:21.800
Don't stop and go, hey, man.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
I actually don't do commission.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
Hey, man.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
I don't do paper lead.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.200
I only do flat fee.

02:26.200 --> 02:27.440
You're going to spook them.

02:27.440 --> 02:32.280
The time to bring up the flat fee is after you've explained why commission sucks and

02:32.280 --> 02:35.440
why paper lead sucks during the screencast.

02:35.440 --> 02:36.440
Let them talk.

02:36.440 --> 02:37.440
Let them share.

02:37.440 --> 02:40.440
Let them keep thinking they're going to get a commission deal.

02:40.440 --> 02:41.880
Don't tell them they're going to get a commission deal.

02:41.880 --> 02:44.000
Don't agree with them, but let them talk.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
Don't get frustrated.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
Don't get flustered.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.360
Just realize what they're trying to do is they're trying to let you know that, hey,

02:49.400 --> 02:52.160
They're comfortable paying a commission, but they don't want to do anything else.

02:52.160 --> 02:54.000
But the thing is they don't understand.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.440
They don't understand why paper lead actually sucks for them.

02:56.440 --> 02:57.960
They don't understand why commission.

02:57.960 --> 03:01.120
There's no incentive for either of you, but there's a time and a place.

03:01.120 --> 03:05.120
I just wanted to mention once again, do not drop price too early.

03:05.120 --> 03:07.600
Do not drop deal structure too early or you're going to kill the deal.

03:07.600 --> 03:10.600
And I want to mention it here because as you start doing these live transfers, you're going

03:10.600 --> 03:14.080
to have a lot of communication with the business owner and they're going to start asking questions.

03:14.080 --> 03:15.240
They're going to get comfortable with you.

03:15.240 --> 03:17.080
They're going to ask and be like, hey, bro.

03:17.120 --> 03:19.560
So, you know, how's this going to work?

03:19.560 --> 03:21.640
I know you want to share.

03:21.640 --> 03:22.640
You want to jump ahead.

03:22.640 --> 03:23.640
You want to sell the whole thing.

03:23.640 --> 03:24.920
There's a time and a place.

03:24.920 --> 03:26.960
You don't want to do it yet.

03:26.960 --> 03:29.520
You want to push it off until the proper time.

03:29.520 --> 03:31.520
We're going to get into that in future videos.
