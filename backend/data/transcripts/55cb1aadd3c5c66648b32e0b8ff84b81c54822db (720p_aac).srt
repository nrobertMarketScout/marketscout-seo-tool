1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,160
Okay. So guys, welcome to the call. It is October 22nd, 2024. We're almost a month into

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:15,000
Q4, which is going to put us at like, you know, we have like two to less than two and

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,080
a half months, like 10 weeks left in the year, probably less than 10 weeks left in the year.

4
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,640
And it's just crazy how these years are flying by these months are flying by. But anyway,

5
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:29,640
I just saw the date really quick. Couple things real, real quick. Number one, I hope you guys

6
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:38,400
are having as much fun and as excited about this new RankinRent engine tool as I am. I'm

7
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,040
not in there every single day. I don't want to lie to you, but I am doing this multiple

8
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:46,960
times a week. I'm, you know, blocking out time where I can go in. I can run due diligence.

9
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,720
I can, you know, we've added all of our projects in there. We're testing the search volume

10
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:58,200
tool. We're looking at our, what's it called? Our project management side. And we're doing

11
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,880
everything inside of RankinRent engine. So if you guys have no idea what I'm talking

12
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:07,120
about, you probably were not on the live that we ran a couple of weeks ago with Ryan Dalton.

13
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:15,400
And basically in short, we now have an official tool that we can say definitively, this is

14
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,880
the tool that we're going to use. This is the standard. This is the metrics we're going

15
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,520
to go off of. This is going to be when we say, here's how much it needs to be in search

16
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:27,660
volume. It's going to go off of this tool. And that is exciting because up until now,

17
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:32,720
it's kind of been like, hey, use whatever you want. And you have to kind of figure out

18
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:38,580
the numbers on your own, which is good and bad. But I'm excited because I've never been

19
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:43,660
able to like endorse any tool or say this is the one because I didn't have control over

20
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:49,520
it. Right. And so, you know, we've used SEMrush. We've used Mangools. We've used, we've talked

21
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,260
about keyword planner. We've talked about, what else? There's a bunch of different ones

22
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:59,460
that we've talked about with Ahrefs, like all kinds of different stuff. But now we have

23
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:05,620
one RankinRentEngine.com and we are in the middle of a four to five week beta test. It

24
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:10,780
is a paid beta test and we've gotten some really, really good feedback. We know it's

25
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:17,140
not perfect. We weren't expecting it to be perfect. And that's why we asked you guys

26
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:22,980
to help us. And so I know for me and my team, we're in there between all of us. We're in

27
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:27,380
there every single day and we've already done a bunch of, we've given a bunch of feedback

28
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:33,460
to Ryan who he's taking to the developers and we're making those adjustments. And yeah.

29
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:36,980
So anyway, if you guys don't know what I'm talking about, you missed that, go to RankinRentEngine.com

30
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:42,240
what I would actually encourage you to do. And I'm saying this because I had somebody

31
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,340
message me, it was this morning or yesterday that said, hey, so do you recommend that I

32
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:52,440
use SEMrush? And I said, no, that's not the case at all. I recommend that you use RankinRentEngine.

33
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:59,200
And so I want to drop this live that we did. Let me see if I can find it really quick.

34
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:07,200
Hold on. Tool Ryan Dalton. Check out this live that I did with Ryan Dalton. And from

35
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:18,560
this, hold on. Okay. Pause that. From this guys, you can go, what's up Nicholas John,

36
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,440
man. Okay. You guys want to check that out. And if you are somebody that wants to be part

37
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:31,080
of the paid beta, you can use the following code. I'll drop that in as well. Here we go.

38
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:38,080
I think it's Ignition24 and it's like a 20% off discount for the first couple of months.

39
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:44,760
But I am stoked about the tool. Just because it does all the stuff that I was, I had like

40
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:52,240
all kinds of tools. I had Google Sheets. We had Pipe Drive. We had a custom tool that

41
00:03:52,240 --> 00:04:01,640
our software guy built for us. We were using, at one point using Asana. We were also using,

42
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,160
there's another one. I can't even remember what it's called. I mean, we had like five,

43
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,720
six, seven different tools that we were checking out, trying with Google Drive, this, that,

44
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:11,720
the rest. Now we have one place. We have our team members. We can assign tasks. We can

45
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,280
keep track. We can see what we need to do. And it's pretty dang cool. You can see your projects.

46
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:21,000
It saves all your due diligence. If nothing else, the thing that I love the most, guys,

47
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,240
is that it's saving me a ton of time on the due diligence. So anyway, guys,

48
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,280
if you don't know what I'm talking about, then check out that live. Use that code if you're

49
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,480
interested. If not, we're going to be doing an official launch the first or second week

50
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:37,760
of November, but it is going to be full price. So if you're interested, I would check that out

51
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:43,040
as soon as possible. Okay. Last two things, guys, really, really quick. I made this post

52
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,920
inside of the art of digital real estate, our free group. And I did that because I didn't want

53
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:53,040
to confuse anyone. I wanted to wait and explain this to you guys. But guys, if you do not already,

54
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,360
hold on one second. Let me get rid of these stupid notifications. If you do not already,

55
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,640
hold on, hold on. Give me one second.

56
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:14,880
Okay. If you guys have not already seen that post, me and Francesca and our agency are in the process

57
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:23,120
of really trying to scale. And we are looking for people who have websites, projects that are

58
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,960
ranking, that are producing leads, but that do not have clients yet. Maybe you guys have built them

59
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:33,200
and you've tried to get a client. You haven't been able to. They're getting leads, whatever the case

60
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:41,040
is. And you want to turn those into cash because you now, first and foremost, if you, I encourage

61
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,560
you to keep your assets, right? Because an asset is something that's going to pay you again and

62
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,720
again and again. And if all you need is a renter, I want you to keep trying to get them in. I don't

63
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,440
want you guys to do this, to hook me up. I'm talking about those of you that may have a

64
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,160
website that you've tried to sell it. You can't sell it, whatever the case is, or maybe you need

65
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,840
some quick cash. I want you to message Francesca, let her know. Now this needs to be a website that

66
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,960
is consistently producing leads that does not have a business owner. Okay. It's ranking and

67
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,280
producing leads, not with ads, because guys, I can go set up my own. We have our own projects

68
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,680
running with ads. I'm talking about projects that are already ranking that do not have clients that

69
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:24,240
you want to potentially turn into cash. And by the way, we are going to make an offer to you. If we

70
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,160
look at it, it looks good. We'll make an offer to you. And we're going to make a fair offer, right?

71
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,160
If you don't have a client, it's not going to be worth near what it's going to be worth with a

72
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,080
client. But I don't want your website as a client because I can go find a client, right? That's what

73
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,080
I do. It's not that difficult. But if you are somebody that has a project that is ranking,

74
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:45,200
has leads coming in, then message Francesca if you're interested in possibly offloading that.

75
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:50,240
Okay. Last thing I want to mention, guys, is we are in the process of outlining version 3.0 of our

76
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,400
training. So this will be the third time that we've actually shot the training. We're outlining

77
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:59,360
right now, looking to shoot it and finalize it in quarter one of next year. So don't get too,

78
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,560
I don't want everyone to ask me every five seconds when it's going to be done.

79
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,240
Where there's a few things that we're testing, there's a few things that we're making sure,

80
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:14,880
like for example, we are actually trying a new strategy, a new kind of wrinkle to our ads set up

81
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:22,160
and our ads process, which we are now in the week, probably six of testing. And we're probably going

82
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,000
to be doing it for three, three, four more weeks. That's going to be something that we include in

83
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,480
version 3.0. I'm bringing this up because if you guys have things, feedback, suggestions,

84
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:37,040
please DM me and fix it Felix on a group message and let us know. But we like, I'm not going to

85
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,880
sit here and pretend like it's perfect. I know it's not perfect. There's things that have changed.

86
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,480
There's things that I'm doing differently that I wasn't doing. We understand that there's a

87
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:49,120
few things that may be a little bit confusing that we didn't realize. So rather than making like

88
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,640
a post that says, oh, I don't understand this, this and this, just message us and we're going

89
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:00,960
to add that to the outline. It is okay if you guys ask questions, but we would just appreciate

90
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,120
the feedback and just know that we're working on it. We hear your feedback. We're excited to make

91
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,800
the version 3.0 and there's also going to be a 4.0 and a 5.0 and probably a 10.0 because we're

92
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,680
never going to be done with this business because I'm in this business just like you guys are in

93
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:19,360
this business. Okay. That said guys, let's go into the call today. Let's talk about taxes. Let's

94
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,000
talk about how to save money. Let's talk about how to keep as much money as possible that we're

95
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,200
actually making. So I want to give you a little context. My buddy, Cale Goodman is going to be

96
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:35,280
joining me here in about two minutes. Cale is a guy I met back in 2016. Ironically, I met Cale

97
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:40,240
right when I started my agency, right when I started doing my own ranking, right? And this

98
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,360
is at the point where I was just trying to get clients and I didn't understand what industries

99
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,600
to go into, what a good city looked like, what a good niche looked like. And I was literally in

100
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,280
the process of reaching out to all my buddies. Hey, do you know anybody that owns a business?

101
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:57,520
Do you know anybody that owns a business? And I got introduced to Cale Goodman. We went and actually

102
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:05,200
had sushi with another buddy of mine and he owns this amazing company called Easier Accounting.

103
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,920
Now, I didn't realize at the time this probably wasn't the best industry to generate leads doing

104
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,840
the method that we use, the rank and rent method. But you know what? I was out there just making

105
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:18,720
offers, trying to get money coming in the door. So we met for lunch. He said, hey, come by the office.

106
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,680
I went to the office and I sat in front of him and three of his, sorry, two partners, so three

107
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,320
total people across from me. And I pitched them on this idea of doing rank and rent,

108
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,520
building a website, ranking it and sending them leads. And when I walked out of that meeting,

109
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:38,560
I walked out with a thousand dollar check and he shook my hand and he put his faith in me,

110
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,840
said, go get me some leads. Now, I didn't do a flat fee deal. I did like a paper lead, whatever.

111
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:48,240
And to be very honest, I got him a few leads and I knew it wasn't going to work. He knew

112
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,760
it wasn't going to work. He was cool about it. He gave me a chance and I didn't know that that

113
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,880
wasn't the greatest. Now, funny enough, I actually generated leads. I had a website called like

114
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:04,880
reddesertaccounting.com, something like that. And leads actually came in. The issue was they

115
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,320
weren't the type of leads that he was looking for because he has a very specific type of person

116
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,600
he wants to work with and that he does the best with. And so it wasn't the best use of

117
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,880
the rank and rent model. However, that's the first thing. A couple of years later, that was 2016,

118
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:25,600
2017 guys, or sorry, end of 2016. Many of you guys know I went and tried to start a software company.

119
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,520
I thought I was too cool for school. I thought I was too cool for the rank and rent model. I

120
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:34,160
went and tried to start a software company, which I failed miserably at. After that was done,

121
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:40,240
end of 2017, July, end of July, I started getting into SEO. I needed to pay the bills. I needed to

122
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,720
pay the bills. I was trying to get money coming in and I needed SEO money because I needed as

123
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:50,320
much as possible. I needed to keep, you know, those high margin deals. Well, a few months after,

124
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:56,640
maybe six months after I got really heavy into that SEO, you know, aspect pitching deals and

125
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:02,240
everything, I had a guy that I was partnering with on this SEO stuff. And I said to him, I said,

126
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,800
hey, I know these guys, let's go meet with them. It's going to be tough. You know, the SEO in this

127
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:13,120
space is difficult. And there we were, what is a year and a half later, sitting at the same table,

128
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:19,440
this time pitching an SEO deal. And I will be, I'm happy to tell you guys, I walked out of that deal

129
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:27,360
with a $4,000 per month retainer doing their SEO. And we did that for about six months, I believe.

130
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,400
And then this guy, Cale called me and he's like, dude, I'm doing the math here. I'm thinking I'm

131
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:36,880
just hiring somebody because I'm paying you guys like 4,000 bucks a month. So he's like, I just

132
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,120
want to let you know, you guys have been great. Said, no problem, man. I totally get it. Obviously,

133
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,200
it killed me to hear that, but I was like, whatever. And funny enough, he ended up taking my

134
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,600
partner. My partner called me. He's like, dude, I need something that's very, that's like more stable.

135
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,760
He's like, I think I'm going to apply for this job. So they ended up basically pulling him out

136
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,800
of my hand and hiring him for that retainer plus a little bit of money. And that was it.

137
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:04,080
We've maintained a great relationship over the years and he's just a super cool dude. I'm excited

138
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:09,840
for you guys to actually get to know him, get some tips, get some tips and tricks, some strategies

139
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:15,920
from him. And I want to say one thing. What I've learned about accounting is this can either make

140
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,720
you or break you. I was sitting with a guy that's worth over a hundred million dollars and he said

141
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,680
to me repeatedly, he said, it's not about what you make. It's about what you can keep. The second

142
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,840
thing my dad always, something my dad always used to tell me is he said, there's two things that you

143
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:33,680
do not want to be cheap about. And this is somebody taught him this. It's your attorney

144
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,920
and it's your accountant because you never want to scrimp on that. And so guys, from the day that I

145
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:43,200
started making money on my own, I've been paying professionals. I've never tried to do attorney

146
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,440
work on my own. I've always paid someone to start a set up my businesses, whatever. And I've always

147
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,880
paid an accountant to keep my books. I've spent, you know, heaven knows how much money on it, but

148
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:58,320
I know I've made five, 10 X what I've spent. So I'm excited. I'm going to be Kaelin right now.

149
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:04,480
And guys, the very last thing I'll say, if I heard somebody say this a few years back and it really

150
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:11,520
resonated with me, if you want to make professional money, you need to treat this business professionally.

151
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:14,960
The reason some of you guys are making side hustle money is because you're treating this

152
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:19,040
like a side hustle. The reason I make professional money doing this is because I treat this

153
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,680
professionally. I don't mess around with this. This is my business. This is my baby. I don't,

154
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,560
I'm not freaking doing this for my mom's basement. And even if I was, I'm treating this as if I'm

155
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:35,280
sitting at a skyscraper in a corner office. If you want to make professional money,

156
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:39,360
treat this professionally. And this is a way that you can do that. So let me bring Kaelin

157
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,440
really quick and we will get right into this call. One second. Let me see where he's at.

158
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,800
Hold on. There we go.

159
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:00,000
All right. Let's see if these guys can hear me. Kael, let me know if you can hear me, bro.

160
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,240
Got double Kael. I think it's Kason coming on with him.

161
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:13,040
Hold on. One sec. Oh, there he is. What's up, bro?

162
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,080
Dude, we're trying out something new today. We got the, like, the vibe board up over here

163
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:23,280
so we can share some stuff with you guys over there. We got super cool stuff for everybody

164
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:28,320
today and we're excited to be here. Amazing. Kason, what's up, bro? How are you?

165
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,480
I'm good, dude. Are you guys trying to join from another link as well? It says something's

166
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:39,120
connecting the audio. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, okay. Cool. I'll grab it. Yeah. No, no, no. You're good. You're

167
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,800
good. I just want to make sure there wasn't somebody else. So, Kael, what's up, bro? How

168
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:47,280
you doing? I'm doing great, man. Thanks for having me on today. For sure, man. I'm stoked

169
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:52,640
about this. I was just kind of giving a little preface introduction and told everyone that when

170
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:59,440
I first started doing this business, I came in and I was pitching you and I think it was JD

171
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:06,240
and Trevor. And yeah, you had faith in me. You gave me a chance, which I appreciated. And then

172
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,520
we did an SEO deal together and you stole my partner, Corey, which is cool.

173
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,480
That was cool. By the way, you just muted yourself on accident. Hold on.

174
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,280
Yeah, just unmute yourself. Okay. There you go. I can hear you now. You're good. You're good.

175
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:31,200
Okay. Oh, you have that one. Okay. So yeah, just me, one of them. And let me know. You can hear me,

176
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:36,960
right? No, we're good. We can hear you just fine. Do you hear an echo? Yeah, I'm here to echo.

177
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,640
You're good. You're good. Take care of it. And then we'll go through. So guys, real quick,

178
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:48,560
while they're getting that stuff set up, I want you guys, if you have questions related to taxes

179
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:54,240
and accounting related to this business, you guys can start dropping them in the comments.

180
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:59,360
We'll hit those at the end. Kael, you still got me? Oh, shit. I can't hear you now, bro.

181
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:11,360
Dude. There we go. I could see myself twice. I can see myself on the, but I can't hear an

182
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,120
echo anymore. So I think we're good there. Beautiful. Can you hear me? Yeah, we're good,

183
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:23,760
but no echo. So we're good. Sweet, dude. So yeah, that's dope, dude. So let's start off by just

184
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:30,000
doing like an intro, how the hell you got here into this space. Then I know you guys got some

185
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,720
stuff you want to share. I've also got some things that are interesting for me to kind of just throw

186
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:41,200
out there, but yeah, let's just kind of, let's start rolling. All of it, man. So to give you a

187
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:46,800
little background. Well, first of all, uh, me and Nick, you know, we, we talked for, I don't know,

188
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,080
dude months at the gym. That's where I first met you is at the gym. And then you were kind of like,

189
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:54,720
dude, I want to come in and show you some stuff. Right. And then he built a kind of a competing

190
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,960
company that did generate us leads. What wasn't it? It was just a competing company on our,

191
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:03,200
on a Google. Anyway, the whole thing worked is all I was going to say. And so it's kind of cool

192
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:07,280
to see years later, how you spun this up. You're teaching other people how to do it. You're getting

193
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:12,160
people results. And I really like it because it's a business model where people can get out and they

194
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,240
can make money. Anybody's got a little hustle to them and anyone's got like, you know, some,

195
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,680
some charisma about them. Like they can get out and find these deals all day long with people,

196
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:24,160
you know? And so, um, so I really like it because you can instantly be what they call open for

197
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,320
business, which is a tax term. I want to talk about with these guys today as well, which is huge to

198
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:33,440
open up a ton of tax savings, no matter what happens with business. And so, um, so that's kind

199
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,480
of a really cool thing that I like about your business model as well as like, literally you

200
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:42,080
can get people instantly open for business by IRS terms to help them really keep a ton of money in

201
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:48,880
the building phases. And so, uh, but, uh, but to give a little background, dude, so I, um, I,

202
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:54,320
so I actually came from a household growing up where all we did was fight about money in our

203
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:59,200
house, right? My parents were like constantly battling because my dad was a self-employed

204
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:04,800
blue collar contractor, he did siding, rain gutters, you know, solve a patient. He's just a,

205
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:09,920
just a contractor guy, but he was an independent guy. He had a crew, um, and he never understood

206
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:15,520
the money side of business and he never wanted to prioritize it. Um, so all I heard about my entire

207
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:20,720
household, my whole, my whole upbringing was, you know, this fight about the IRS, right? And so my

208
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:26,160
mom, uh, and dad were constantly fighting about money. And eventually after years and years and

209
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,000
years of them always fighting about this IRS, I didn't know what it was. I'm just a kid, right?

210
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,880
But as I got older, I started understanding more. And then the IRS finally, after a while, they

211
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,360
came in and started taking things, right? So, um, they, they literally came in and leaned my dad's

212
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:46,880
house. Um, they levy did his bank account. So I remember I helped him finish a job up in Salt Lake

213
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:52,320
City. Um, just as a young kid, I think I was like 13 or something working on a big apartment complex

214
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:57,280
up there with him. He was so excited to come put this big check in the bank, pay all his guys,

215
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,680
pay some money to the IRS because they'd been on his back before the second he put that money in

216
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:06,400
the bank account before he could use any of it. Boom, levy took it all out. He's like some $40,000

217
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:12,080
check, you know? And so now they're levy his bank accounts. They're leaning his home. My mom goes

218
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:19,440
and gets a job as a grocery, you know, a checker at Albertsons here in town. And they end up

219
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,360
garnishing your paychecks after like a month or two of working there. And so now, now they just

220
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,920
really squoze my parents to where like literally my dad had to just work for cash under the table,

221
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:31,120
you know? So in my mind, I was like, why would anybody want to be a business owner? I don't

222
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,920
ever want to do that. Like, heck no. And so, um, but I always wanted to make money. I always want

223
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:39,360
to have a great, great life. I always wanted to have financial abundance. And so, you know,

224
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,440
and I was just a hustler at heart. And so, uh, one of the best things that ever happened to me

225
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:48,480
is I ended up getting recruited as a sales guy by a guy that owned a tax and accounting firm to come

226
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,840
and do business development and sales with his entire, uh, accounting company. And so I got

227
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:58,080
really good at that. I became his top guy. I really, because of my upbringing, really threw

228
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:03,360
myself into it. And so I spent more time with the CPAs than I did the other sales guys, constantly

229
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:08,720
just trying to learn as much as I possibly could, because I finally understood like, wow, the IRS

230
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,960
didn't take everything from us. My dad just didn't understand it. He didn't want to put the

231
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,840
effort into getting the knowledge and creating the systems and the habits around the money side of

232
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,720
business, the tax side of business in order to really become successful. And so that gave me the

233
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,400
courage to start my own business. And then it gave me the courage to start my own accounting firm

234
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:32,320
and partner with some really great CPAs. And so here we are over 15 years later, and we've got

235
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:38,400
an awesome accounting firm. We got multiple CPAs and EAs and accountants with masters

236
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,640
that are in here serving our clients. And so our whole thing is like, Hey, we want to serve

237
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,000
business owners the way they need to be served, right? Cause anybody can do it. My dad did where

238
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,080
they went down, they just had a CPA and they brought them all their stuff every year and they

239
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,440
guessed. And then they, and then they, the accountants really just doing what the business

240
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,800
owner brings them. And then they ended up getting behind the IRS and now they're overwhelmed by it.

241
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:01,840
So they ignore it and all these problems just, you know, start to compound, you know? And so

242
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:07,120
that's basically what we try to avoid. And so even though our company has evolved and we've got

243
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:12,480
companies that are 20, 30, 40, 50 million dollar companies that we do high level tax planning for,

244
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,360
I have always stayed very passionate about helping people kind of in that startup mode. And they're,

245
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,200
they're really just, you know, doing their first side hustle or they're, they're just throwing

246
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:26,800
themselves into their first business. Cause I know that all the magic happens by helping them build

247
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:32,080
the foundation correctly in the beginning stages. Because what I've seen, even with successful

248
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:37,200
business owners is five, six, seven years in, they realize like, holy crap, man, I made

249
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:42,720
a ton of mistakes. I didn't know I shouldn't have brought in a partner and we did an S corp together.

250
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,360
I didn't know I should have, you know, had an LLC and just stayed a partnership there and then

251
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:53,200
created an S corp later individually. I didn't know C corporations were a thing and that there's

252
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,840
tax advantages to that once I hit certain levels and I have certain goals. And so, you know, and

253
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:02,000
then what happens is they have to redo it. And so, and that's what, that's what we like to do is

254
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,520
like really help entrepreneurs, like get the information they need, inspire them to start

255
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:12,960
creating the right habits, tax wise, get the right foundation laid, you know, and, and that way as

256
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,840
they scale, you know, cause everybody wants to scale, everybody wants to become really scalable.

257
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:22,800
And it's like, they always focus on sales and marketing, you know, and then they focus on,

258
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:27,440
I don't know why it's doing that. They focus on sales and marketing and then they focus on

259
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:32,320
operations and then the money's part always comes last. And so we like to inspire people like,

260
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:37,280
Hey, do it all right now. Like get the foundation laid so you can focus on those things and not

261
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:42,240
scaling your money doesn't become an interruption of your business growth, you know, later when you

262
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:47,520
are trying to, you know, when you are doing great numbers, now it's super costly to redo everything

263
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:52,320
later on. So, so anyway, that's kind of a background as well as like what I want to talk about with,

264
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,280
with your community today is like really laying that foundation properly.

265
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:02,880
Okay, bro. And yeah, what I said right before you hopped on is I heard somebody say this a couple

266
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:07,680
years ago, they said, you know, a lot of people that do side hustles, they get frustrated because

267
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:12,960
they're just making like a little bit of money. And it's like, if you want to make professional

268
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:18,000
money, you need to treat this professionally. And so a lot of times we get into this, we treat it

269
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,440
like with something we're doing out of our mom's basement. And even if you are literally in your

270
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:26,400
mom's basement, or something equivalent, you could still treat this like you're sitting at the, you

271
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,720
know, at Kale's office at a corner office, and then this really nice building. But this is one

272
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:36,000
of those things where you need to have your, your, your, what is it, your I's dotted your T's crossed.

273
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:43,840
And so fortunately, my dad was always, he told me this, he said, never be cheap on your accountant

274
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:49,280
or your attorney. And so even when I was barely making money, like when I first started doing

275
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:54,320
business, I always like I set up my first business, I had it done with a professional,

276
00:23:54,320 --> 00:24:00,080
like I never was. He always put that in my head. He's always, you're the you know, are you going

277
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,960
to lose the most money is like, I'm like, where he's like doing the turbo tax and the QuickBooks.

278
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,960
And so I never even questioned it because he ingrained it. But I know that that's not how

279
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:14,160
everybody grew up. I know a lot of my friends grew up. It's like, Dad, you know, he was a school

280
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:19,280
teacher. And so he just went on the turbo tax and it was 200 bucks. Like, no, you just lost money

281
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:25,040
because you're an idiot. So anyway, that said, dude, I want to give you the floor to do some

282
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:30,880
training on what you want to talk about ways that people can save money in 2024. And then if there's

283
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,640
time left, I've got questions on other people got questions. But yeah, let's, let's get

284
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:40,240
I would definitely love to open up some q&a. And I know Casey will jump in here as well. Because

285
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,000
I mean, Casey's on the front lines all the time, man. He's always staying up to date on

286
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:49,360
cool deductions and tax strategies that are counted as the CPAs are, are, you know,

287
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:56,080
implementing for our clients. And so but but yeah, dude, to get to get kind of started. I mean,

288
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,920
that is that is one thing I want to start off by saying, I kind of iterated it there in the intro

289
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:05,760
was like, really, we want to we want to get to a point of like financial security and abundance

290
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:10,960
as quickly as possible. And we and we want to scale to that to that level as soon as possible.

291
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:18,240
And so obviously, one thing I've realized with entrepreneurs is, do they they don't ever just

292
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:23,360
want one stream of income, they want multiple streams of income. And so what happens is,

293
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,360
they they end up creating all these different buckets of income. And then they sometimes

294
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,120
end up partnering on things like, for example, your business model is a beautiful business model.

295
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,680
There might be opportunities in the marketplace that come up like, hey, maybe they're sending

296
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:39,760
you more business and they've created a new stream of income, or maybe they end up building

297
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,960
a team where they're out there helping a bunch of other people in their community do what you're

298
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:47,280
doing. And you know, I mean, so it's like, there's all these different streams of income entrepreneurs

299
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:51,200
do once they start making more and more money, like, how can I scale? How can I scale? And so

300
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:55,520
let me see if I can bring up this one slide, I want to kind of do a little training on

301
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:59,600
Let me give you co host, then you want to share your screen? Are you going to show it on that

302
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:05,600
screen over there? Let me see how it looks real quick on on just the laptop. Okay, cool,

303
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,520
because either way, I'm not used to the whiteboard thing, man. I'm like,

304
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:13,200
this is so interesting, you know, but I want to learn it.

305
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:18,800
It's all good, man. And I'm gonna do this. Hold on, let me see if I can give you like

306
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:29,920
spotlight so that it shows just your face alone. Yeah. Okay, it's spotlighting the whiteboard.

307
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:37,040
But I'm getting, I'm getting that like 1000 different tiles showing into eternity, you know,

308
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:42,960
let me try some here. Because I want to walk people through kind of a

309
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:57,200
current. Let's go to your slide. Yeah, I want to show people a current kind of how I'm personally

310
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:04,640
structured. And then kind of give them a good I want I want people to understand kind of now and

311
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:10,960
the future and why it's so beneficial for them to get all structured properly, you know, so

312
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:16,320
can you see that slide? Yeah, that's that's I can see it. Guys, let me know in the comments,

313
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:21,120
you can see it. I can see it pretty well. So I think I think it's pretty solid. Yeah.

314
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:26,400
Okay, so I'll walk you through some of this stuff. This is this is important stuff. I

315
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,400
really hit home, I've went and talked to some groups before. And you know, we spend a lot of

316
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:38,080
time on this, because, you know, really, the first understanding that we have to create as we are

317
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,040
starting a business is like, there's there's different kinds of income that the IRS looks

318
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:47,760
at, right? And one of them is, you know, active income, which is all your business activities,

319
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,760
and then business owners, they either want to go create multiple streams of income, because they

320
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,920
get good at business, or they want to start diversifying and building passive streams of

321
00:27:55,920 --> 00:28:00,560
incomes, you know, which is buying assets and, you know, things that are taxed at capital gains

322
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:04,480
rates. And so we have to we have to have an understanding of like, what, what am I making?

323
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,080
What am I doing right now? It's like, okay, well, you're doing active income with your business

324
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,440
model, Nick, like this, what they're doing, they're doing active income. But as you if you want to

325
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,120
become scalable, you really want to create security, you know, one day, you're going to

326
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:19,200
have to start investing. Well, when you start buying stocks that you hold for over a year,

327
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,680
you start buying assets that you hold for over a year, like rental properties or whatever,

328
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:28,480
the appreciation on those gains is taxed at passive income. Well, we don't want that to pass

329
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,720
through to us as active income, you know, because then we're going to get taxed at earned income

330
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:38,560
rates, you know, which can be, you know, well, it can be 15% up to 37%, right? Plus your stake

331
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:43,120
taxes. And, you know, and then there's a lot of double taxation, we got to look out for on the

332
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:48,240
active income streams as well. Like right now, when you're not making any money, or you're just

333
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,960
starting to make a little bit, you don't obviously start paying taxes until you start becoming

334
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:58,960
profitable. Okay, once you become profitable, if you're just set up as a single member LLC,

335
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,440
or a sole proprietorship, which is just doing business in your name, you know, the income's

336
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:08,240
all passing through to you directly, and you're going to get taxed your earned income rates,

337
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:13,520
which is the 15 to 30%, plus your state taxes, if you're in a state where there's state taxes,

338
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:17,600
and then you're going to also pay the self-employment taxes. And the self-employment

339
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:23,680
taxes are basically the, the social security for both the employee and the employer. Well,

340
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:27,120
they're saying, well, hey, you're self-employed, it's all flowing through to you. So you need to

341
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:34,160
pay all of it. So it ends up being 15.3%. Right? So, and so, so people start doing the math,

342
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:39,680
and they're like, man, like, I'm paying 40, 45, 50% in taxes on this income that's flowing

343
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:43,440
through to me. Then they're like, I started this as a side hustle, so I could quit my job. They're

344
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,720
like, man, I'm never gonna be able to quit my job when I'm, you know, literally having to give

345
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:52,320
half of it back to the, to the government, you know? And so one of the biggest tax savings that

346
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:58,000
we can create for people is helping them understand where to start and when the right time is to

347
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:04,800
switch to an S corporation. Okay? But we don't want people to do it incorrectly. And so I built

348
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:10,080
this little diagram to give people kind of an idea. And, and this is a little outdated. Some of these

349
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:14,400
companies that have sold, like I'm not a part of RBO anymore. I've sold that. I sold you tax over

350
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:19,600
here. I am still owner of these other companies. And then, you know, I have some other things like

351
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:24,240
coffee shops now that me and my wife are doing it. So this is outdated. This isn't, this isn't my

352
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:29,360
exact situation anymore. I need to jump in and update it one of these days. But if you look at,

353
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:38,800
if you look at what we got going on right in the center, it says KG3 Corp. KG3 Corp is an S

354
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:45,440
corporation. All these other entities are either LLCs or LLC partnerships. Down here, my rental

355
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:51,840
properties at the bottom, those are all holding LLC companies. Okay? So some are flowing directly

356
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:56,960
through me. Some are flowing directly to my corporation, which is then where I pay myself.

357
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:03,120
And so a lot of people are asking question when they get started, like, do I even need to set up

358
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:10,720
an LLC? Right? And I always tell people like, absolutely do. Like there is no reason why you

359
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:16,000
shouldn't set up an LLC. An LLC doesn't really do a whole lot to save you money on taxes because

360
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,920
it's taxed just like a sole proprietorship is. Okay? But a sole proprietorship, the money flows

361
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:27,520
directly through you. Same with an LLC. And then there's also the S corporation. Okay? And so

362
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:35,600
the S corporation is taxed as a corporation. The benefit of that is you don't have to pay the 15.3%

363
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:41,280
self-employment taxes, but there's some rules. Like, first of all, you have to pay yourself a

364
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:46,800
fair and reasonable salary. And what the IRS says is they say it's fair and reasonable. That's all

365
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:50,080
they put in there. They don't give any stipulations or guidance on it. They say you just have to pay

366
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:54,480
yourself a fair and reasonable salary for your duties of the job. So somebody could be, let's just

367
00:31:54,480 --> 00:32:03,280
give an example. Let's say you start this business and you decide, hey, I want to set up as an LLC.

368
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:08,000
And here's the benefit of setting up as an LLC. First of all, you get to create separation between

369
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,120
you and the business. Okay? So now we can establish a lot of really good habits, right? Like we can,

370
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:17,600
you know, separate the business transactions from the personal transactions. We go down to our bank,

371
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:22,080
we take our EIN, we set up the bank account numbers, totally separate from us. There's liability

372
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:26,160
protection. If anyone tries to sue the business, they can't sue me as long as I don't do any

373
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:30,960
commingling. If they try to sue me, they can't sue the business. So I've got separation between me

374
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,880
and the business. So there's all these benefits. I tell people, absolutely, you should always set

375
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:42,080
up an LLC. There's very rare situations that you should not set up an LLC, right? And so I always

376
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:46,160
tell people, LLC is great, okay? And they're usually super affordable. Some states, they have

377
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:50,800
high state fees, but most of the time they're super affordable. It's worth setting up just

378
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:57,120
to establish the right habits and the separation for the legalities, okay? But we're still being

379
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:01,360
taxed at earned income rates and we're still being taxed like a sole proprietorship. We're still

380
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:05,920
liable to pay those self-employment taxes, but that doesn't matter until we're profitable,

381
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:11,040
okay? Well, what pass-through means, Nick, is pass-through means the deduction, the income

382
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:15,680
flows through directly to you and that's where you get taxed, but then so do all the deductions.

383
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:23,520
So we like to teach people like, hey, set up an LLC, create as many tax deductions as possible.

384
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:28,960
We don't want to become super profitable until we absolutely start outweighing all of the

385
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,360
deductions that we possibly can. We want to pay as little as possible as far as taxes go.

386
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:40,720
Anyway, so we like to set up the LLC to start, okay? And then we like to educate people. When

387
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:45,760
is the right time to switch to an S corporation? Well, because an S corporation does have a little

388
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:50,000
bit higher cost tax return and it has some compliance, things like setting up some payroll

389
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,920
and there's a little payroll cost to pay yourself a fair and reasonable salary to get out of those

390
00:33:53,920 --> 00:34:00,080
self-employment taxes. We like to tell people like, hey man, as soon as you start outweighing

391
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:06,000
all your deductions and you start getting to the point where you're making $20,000 a year profit,

392
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,920
it's really beneficial to start looking at switching to an S corporation. But there's a

393
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:17,120
lot of mistakes that happen along the way when people go to CPAs or attorneys to do this because

394
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:22,240
a lot of times CPAs and attorneys, they're just looking at it as a tax law. They'll tell you to

395
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:26,960
switch too soon or they'll tell you to switch too late because they're just looking at it from

396
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:32,240
a taxation point. And so they're not looking at it like from a business owner perspective.

397
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:37,600
And so a business owner perspective, we want to have sometimes multiple structures created to

398
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:43,280
create the best tax savings opportunity and get out of the self-employment taxes, maximize as many

399
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:50,080
deductions as we possibly can. So to break it down in kind of simple math, let's just say,

400
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:54,480
easy for math, you go start the side hustle, you're a couple of years in, boom, you're making

401
00:34:54,480 --> 00:35:01,520
$100,000 a year profit. Well, you're probably going to end up paying about, on the profit,

402
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:09,360
just as an LLC, you're going to end up paying $35,000 to $45,000 after the self-employment taxes

403
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:15,920
directly to the IRS. And so that's a huge tax liability people don't want. But if you switch

404
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:23,120
at the right time to an S corporation, well, then you're eliminating the 15.3% right off the top.

405
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:27,760
And you've created the separation between you and the business to create a lot more different

406
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:34,160
tax strategies to reduce the taxation even more. And so I built this diagram just to break it down.

407
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:39,440
So I keep all of my partnerships and all of my single-member LLCs,

408
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:45,840
all, which are all the ones that have the arrows pointing to the KG3 Corp. I keep all those LLCs.

409
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:50,000
I don't switch any of them to S corporations. And then I flow them all to my S corporation,

410
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,080
which is there where I pay my, that's where I pay myself a fair and reasonable salary. And that's

411
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:59,920
where I end up taking most of my personal tax deductions that aren't tied to all my different

412
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:05,040
partners and all my different business ventures. And so this is the foundation we like to lay with

413
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:08,960
entrepreneurs early on so that they can gain an understanding of like,

414
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:17,760
okay, when is the right time to switch to an S corporation? How can I flow my money to me without

415
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:23,200
being double-taxed? And so this is the best way to do it, depending on your situation. Some people

416
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:31,520
are in different situations. We've had people come to us where they have disability or they have a

417
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:37,040
high-income earning spouse, or they have a partner that's overseas and so they need a S corporation.

418
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,960
So there's different situations for different people that we have to take into consideration

419
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:46,960
that we do consult on before we do anything. But this is like a good broad diagram that we built

420
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:52,640
just to help people kind of understand the benefits of LLCs, creating separation, maximizing deductions,

421
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:56,960
flowing it to you personally so you don't get double-taxed to keep majority of the money that

422
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:07,600
you're making as a business owner. So just to understand your setup is KG3 is an S Corp

423
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:14,160
and these other entities are LLCs that flow into KG3, but KG3 is what actually pays you.

424
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:19,840
Yeah, exactly. And I know I like to paint this future picture, Nick, just to give people

425
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:23,840
understanding of like, okay, like this seems like it could be a complex thing, but people are like,

426
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:29,360
where can I start now? Do I need an LLC right now? And so I like to paint this picture

427
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:35,600
for people because I don't want to see them make the mistakes that a lot of business owners make

428
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:39,840
later when they do get to the point where they're like, hey, I'm starting to become profitable,

429
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:47,680
and I have a partner and they go to talk to an accountant or a CPA and the CPA is like,

430
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:53,040
well, you're going to save 15.3% by switching to an S Corp. Well, now your partner and you have

431
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:57,360
an S Corp together, but now you guys have joined each other together on this corporation. When you

432
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:03,200
didn't have to do that, you could have kept your business in LLC and you could have just each set

433
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:08,880
up your own individual S corporations. And now you guys have the independence, right? So this

434
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:13,760
partner over here can go and build other multiple streams of income and assets that flow to him.

435
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:19,680
And you can go and build multiple streams of income separately, but you still have your thing

436
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:24,960
together in the LLC, but you each have your own individual S corporations. And then that's

437
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:29,600
where you kind of fully control your tax liability. And so that's like one of the biggest mistakes I

438
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:35,360
see for people as they scale and grow a business and create multiple streams of income is they end

439
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:41,920
up forming their S corporation when it's time to switch to an S corporation and they keep their

440
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:47,280
partner on it. And so that's a big thing I like to educate people on the future side of things.

441
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:51,600
But right now, while we're just getting started, I like people to understand the benefits of just

442
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:59,120
getting an LLC, maximizing as many deductions as possible to keep as much money as you possibly can

443
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:05,040
and then switch to an S corporation when the time is right based on you and then doing it properly

444
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:11,680
by keeping it S corporation solely under you and not tying yourself to any partners with that

445
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:15,120
down the road. So I like to paint that future picture, but then I like to help people

446
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:20,080
understand the benefits of setting up an LLC right now for the legalities and all the tax

447
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:24,400
incentives and the separation that they can create or the, you know, incentives that they

448
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:29,600
do create by creating that separation. So anyway, does that make sense so far?

449
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:33,600
Yeah, no, no, no. So, and I think it's smart because you guys, once you, you know, some of

450
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:37,520
you guys are brand new to business, first time ever. And you realize what, like, I'm sure you

451
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:42,640
were like this kale, but once you make money, then it's like the whole world's open and you're like,

452
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:46,480
oh, I can make money here. I can make money. And the hardest part is just not getting shiny

453
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,240
penny syndrome, to be honest, but you are going to find you're going to have multiple streams of

454
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:55,280
income. That's just inevitable. One of the questions I had, and I think you just nailed

455
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:01,200
it just to clarify. So your suggestion would be for anybody that's new, a good first step would

456
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:08,080
be set up an LLC slash start getting as many tax deductions as possible. That's like an amazing

457
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:13,920
first step. Totally, totally. And honestly too, like just having that entity set up properly,

458
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:17,360
because here's the thing, like you're going to go out and you're going to start establishing like,

459
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:23,520
okay, so I'm in digital landlords. I'm going out to find my first client. My first client,

460
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:29,280
he's like, Hey, I want to, I want to pay you on my, my MX every month for this deal. We've created

461
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:33,360
it. Well, now you need a merchant account and a merchant account doesn't want to, you know,

462
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:37,680
they don't, you know, like, you know how merchant accounts are Nick, they're pain in the ass,

463
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:42,400
you don't want to go set up a merchant account right now in your name. And then later be like,

464
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:47,040
Oh, I actually need a new merchant account because I want to set up an LLC because I figured out,

465
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:50,960
I have all this liability and I want all these tax incentives. And so then they're like, Oh,

466
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,000
cool. Now you need a whole new merchant account. Now you're trying to make a new, you know,

467
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,360
you're trying to make your, you're trying to season another merchant account, right? And you

468
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:02,880
have to kind of start over. And so, you know, that's just like one example of like, why not

469
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:08,160
just set up an LLC now if it's affordable for you, right? Cause like some States are 25 bucks,

470
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:14,000
right? It's like 25 bucks, state filing fees, set up an LLC. Now you have an EIN number. Now

471
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,880
you're protected legally. Now you can go start establishing bank accounts, merchant accounts,

472
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:23,520
contracts, agreements with your clients, like all these things under this company,

473
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:27,920
which is totally separate from you for the liability protection. And you can start taking

474
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:32,640
all your deductions, keeping your books totally separate from you. There is no, as long as you

475
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:37,520
really do a good job at setting up bank accounts and keeping those expenses separate, set up a

476
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:41,680
QuickBooks account or set up some spreadsheets. And now you're keeping everything separate from

477
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:47,280
you. And you're establishing really, really valuable habits early on in your business to not

478
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:52,560
only help you keep more, more money that you make, but, but really like, you know, like you're,

479
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:56,000
you're getting it all set up properly in the beginning stages. You don't have to redo it all

480
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:01,360
later. Cause if you set up your structure, you're flowing correctly. And then later you figure out,

481
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:08,400
you know what, I should, I should have been a C Corp or you know what I set up on as a C Corp

482
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:12,240
on accident. Now I need to go back and do this in LLC. Well, now you have to go redo all those

483
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:17,200
things. You have to get new merchant accounts, new agreements, new insurance policies, new bonds. If

484
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:21,360
you need bonds with your state, new like everything under this new entity, because everybody views an

485
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:25,360
entity as a totally separate entity. It's, it's not you anymore. And it's not this other company

486
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:29,440
anymore. So if you have to redo it, it's like, man, that causes a huge interruption in your

487
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:36,080
business. So starting with an LLC is very wise because one, if you're the sole owner of the

488
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:40,480
business and you decide to switch it to an S corporation later on, you can, or if you decide

489
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:45,680
to switch it to a C corporation later, you can, you know, and like, and that's, and that's necessary

490
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:50,080
at times as well. If you scale really massively and you'd be end up becoming, you know, creating

491
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:56,960
this business venture to something very large, you can switch to a C corporation and avoid paying

492
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:03,280
taxes on the first $10 million that you make in the sell of your business later on. But you have

493
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:08,560
to be a C corporation for five years. And so I tell you all that just because an LLC is very

494
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:14,320
versatile. Start now, create the habits, get the EINs, get everything set up properly. And then later,

495
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:19,600
if it makes sense, switch it to an S corp or set up a totally separate S corp if you have partners.

496
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:24,400
And then later, you know, if you, if you decide I'm gonna switch it to a C corp, because I want to

497
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:29,920
sell this business one day for 20, 30, 40, $50 million, well, you want to make that first 10 million

498
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:35,200
totally tax free, you know, so there's all these cool benefits that you can do from being an LLC

499
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:40,480
and switching later on or just adding entities like I've done for later on as well. So if I

500
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:45,200
ever sold, for example, easier accounting, I would, I would, I would just flow that to my,

501
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:49,760
my S corporation, or maybe by that time, hopefully I've switched to a C corporation,

502
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,560
you know, so there's just there's benefits that you can do to, to

503
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:59,040
just from starting as an LLC and keeping it very simple, and then understanding these things as you

504
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:05,920
grow. We have a question that is pertinent to what you just said. It said, Stephen says,

505
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:10,880
for those just starting out, do you recommend getting the LLC in the state you live in? He said,

506
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:19,520
Pennsylvania for me as an example, having Google or YouTube this once I get ads now for all sorts

507
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:25,360
of states, LLC is now algorithm. So yeah, should they do it in the state that they're in?

508
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:31,440
I want to, I want to save people a ton of money by not getting scammed. Okay.

509
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:36,720
When you get on the, when you get into business and you set up your first LLC,

510
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,280
you're going to start getting a lot of advertisements and stuff saying, Hey,

511
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:46,320
set up in Delaware, set up in Nevada. Okay. Now there's benefits to that. Okay. However,

512
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:53,200
they don't usually apply. Okay. The IRS is if you ever get audited, they are going to treat you

513
00:44:53,200 --> 00:45:00,880
based on where your taxable presence is, you know, so if you're in Pennsylvania and you got sold by

514
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:05,280
somebody who says, Hey man, set up a Nevada corporation because now you don't pay state taxes.

515
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:10,880
That is a big audit waiting to happen that you will lose because they're going to be like,

516
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:15,600
do you have no taxable presence in Nevada? Why are you trying to say you're in Nevada?

517
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:20,960
You know, a business paying about a taxes plus as an LLC, it all flows to you directly anyway.

518
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:25,680
So I get probably, I don't know, a hundred people every year that are like, Oh man,

519
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:30,160
I set up in Nevada. I'm like, okay, cool. Why? And they're like, well, because I don't pay state

520
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:34,560
taxes. I'm like, well, that's not true. Okay. Or I talk to people in California that come just like,

521
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:38,640
Hey, I need some help fixing stuff and I need to set up in, in my, in California.

522
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:42,160
And they're, and I'm like, okay, why? Well, I set up in Nevada and I got audited.

523
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:46,240
California, they're like ninjas, man. They will find you. Cause if you put anyone on payroll

524
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:51,440
in Pennsylvania or even yourself on payroll in Pennsylvania, but your entities in Nevada,

525
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:56,000
there's like all these things that will trigger them to investigate that. Right. And so your

526
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:03,680
taxable presence is where you're at because you're the business. And then as the organization grows

527
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:08,480
and say, you remove yourself from the business and you, for example, wanted to move to Nevada

528
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:14,080
and become a resident of Nevada or Puerto Rico or Florida or wherever there's no freaking state

529
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:19,200
taxes. Well, then you can set up your S corporation as a consulting company, consulting your other

530
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:23,840
entities and flow money to you without paying state taxes. Right. But you got to go live there.

531
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:27,680
Right. Because now you're a consultant out of Florida, you're a consultant out of Nevada,

532
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:31,360
you know, and you're, those are the states that you're actually in where your taxable presence

533
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:37,520
is. And so I hate when people fall for that scam. Now there is anonymity. So in Delaware, Nevada,

534
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:48,400
Wyoming, there is anonymity saying, well, sorry, can you, sorry. Oh, yeah. Okay. Sorry. My screen

535
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:58,480
changed. Okay. And so I just have you on this conversation. Oh, just me and you. No, everyone

536
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:02,320
can see you, but I just changed. You're the spotlight and I'll change it back when you're

537
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:08,240
done talking. Okay. Okay. So basically, and so basically to save you a ton of money,

538
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:12,800
I always tell people, like, dude, just set up in your state. That's going to save you a ton of

539
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:19,440
money. Not it's going to, you know, avoid a ton of headaches later down the road. There are very

540
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:24,640
cool strategies later that you can create by setting up entities in other states, but the whole

541
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:29,840
anonymity laws are great because, you know, like it shields you. Like if somebody was going to sue

542
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:34,400
you, like, let's just say you had a crazy ex wife. It's like, I know he's got like all these assets

543
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:39,440
he's bought with this new business. He started in digital landlords. And like, let's say you wanted

544
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:45,680
to hide a piece of land from a crazy ex spouse or, you know, or an ex business partner that's always

545
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:50,960
trying to sue you or whatever, right? Like you could go set that up as just a holding LLC that

546
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:59,040
owns land in Delaware or owns land or Wyoming or Delaware LLC that owns land in these other states,

547
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:04,000
but it's just shielding you from them, but you got to set them up properly. And so most people,

548
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,000
even when they set up a Nevada or Delaware corporation, they don't even set them up properly.

549
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,720
They end up setting them up and then they list themselves as an officer. So now they're public

550
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:17,360
information anyway, you know, so you have to actually go set, like hire an attorney to set

551
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:23,600
up the entity act as the officers of the corporation or the entity to totally shield you from the entity

552
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:28,080
and then all of your ownership is basically created in agreements with that attorney or

553
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:32,320
that law firm in order to fully shield it from you. So when you get to the point of where you're

554
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:37,120
really wealthy and you're starting to set up trusts and land trusts, and you want to hide assets and

555
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:42,480
really keep your name off of them, then you talk about like Nevada, Delaware, Wyoming entities,

556
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:46,720
but when you're just starting a business, there's a money trail always leading back to you. Anyway,

557
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:50,560
there's no, there's no point in you setting up out of state. So I know that gets a little bit long,

558
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:55,920
but there is, you know, a lot of that I want to help people avoid by not getting scammed because

559
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:59,520
I know there's companies out of Nevada and stuff that will call and sell you Nevada corporation

560
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:04,800
and they'll charge you five, six, $7,000 for this corporate package, making it sound like you're

561
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:09,040
never going to pay state taxes and you're going to have all these privacy laws and then they don't

562
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:14,240
even set them up properly for the privacy laws. And so typically 99% of the time you don't want

563
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:20,320
to set up out of your own state. Makes sense. Okay. So here's what I want to do really quick

564
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:25,840
in our last few minutes. Because I know some people might hop off right at the,

565
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:30,640
at the hour mark, whatever, but I have a couple of questions that people did ask that I think

566
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:36,800
are really interesting that we should answer. But if like, I would suggest guys, this is what I did

567
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:43,200
when I first got started is like, you got to talk to somebody, figure out what your situation is,

568
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:48,480
what the best, you know, like way forward is whatever. So what's the best way that somebody

569
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:51,840
didn't want to reach out and like, for example, we had a question just barely asking about a

570
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:57,040
specific situation. How can people get in contact with you if they want to call and just kind of

571
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:02,000
talk through their situation? Yeah, we put together a link just for digital landlords. I'm gonna have

572
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:08,640
case and pull this up. So you guys can scan a QR code for it right now off the other screen.

573
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:17,520
If you want to highlight that one, Nick, but that's just, it's really just a QR link going to

574
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:23,600
link that we built just for the digital landlords community. That way it's tagged to your community

575
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:28,800
where we give you guys a full, a free tax assessment, because I know we're getting in,

576
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:33,360
we're in the fourth quarter of the year, first of all. So if you guys jump on the phone with our

577
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:37,600
team, you know, we're not going to talk about just LLCs and everything. We're going to actually talk

578
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:42,320
about you guys, your goals. We're going to talk a little bit about the future stuff, but we're

579
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:46,640
going to talk about all the things you can do right now this year to start saving money because you

580
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:52,000
started this business in this year, which means we can take a ton of deductions this year for your

581
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:58,160
home office, for your vehicle, for your business bills, for your travel, for your laptop, your

582
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:02,480
cell phone, your cell phone bills, your utilities, like all these things that you spend money on

583
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:09,040
personally every year anyway. We want to show you guys how you can deduct those and pass it through

584
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:13,040
to you. Whether you're an LLC, whether you're a sole proprietorship, whether you're a corporation,

585
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:18,320
we want to help create an assessment for you guys where we can help you understand like, wow,

586
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:23,200
this business is really benefiting me this year because when people go spend money to start a

587
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:28,000
business, dude, they're like, holy crap, like it takes a little time before I start making a little

588
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,640
bit of money. How can I get more money to put back into the business or how can I put more money back

589
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:38,560
in my pocket to recoup costs? Well, when you set up an LLC and you strategize, all these deductions

590
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:43,520
pass through to you directly anyway, so we offer this free assessment where people can literally,

591
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:52,240
we can get on our phone with our team, we can look at your lifestyle, a broad estimate of all

592
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:56,480
your expenses that we can now make deductible, show you how we're going to pass them through,

593
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:03,280
and literally give you kind of a broad range of like, dude, we could save you this much money this

594
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:09,920
year and an extra tax refund money from starting this business, right? So we can show people in

595
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:17,760
this assessment how much money they can really save. Can I jump in real quick and say, we typically

596
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:24,080
charge $400 for this assessment. We're doing it for free just for digital landlords. So like,

597
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:29,840
if you're on this call right now, seriously, I can't tell you how many times I've been in an event and

598
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:35,280
pulled up the QR code and thought, I need to go talk to my business partners. So I just open up

599
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:39,360
the window thinking of it back to it when I get back in town and coordinate with my business

600
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:44,320
partners. Don't do that. Click on this QR code right now. If you've got friends, family members,

601
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:50,000
or business partners that are involved with you, just put your information in. My team will reach

602
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:55,520
out. That way it's not an afterthought or something else you forget about. Now, another thing, I have

603
00:52:55,520 --> 00:53:01,440
not made this free offer since January. And the reason for that is last time I did this,

604
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:10,800
people screenshot it, which is great. But there was 150 people at the event and we had 300

605
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:19,360
scheduled appointments. And so it got a little bit crazy. So again, this is for you, your friends,

606
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:25,680
family members, and business partners that are involved. But my team knows digital landlords

607
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:31,280
very well. They understand your business. But again, we need to get on and really assess what

608
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:36,960
your specific situation is and what your goals are to point you in the next right direction.

609
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:42,400
And I promise you, you're going to leave this call with better information when you got on this call.

610
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:47,280
So we're excited to work with you and appreciate everybody's time today.

611
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:55,600
Yeah. One thing I want to say on that is I know for me, when I was looking to get a new attorney

612
00:53:55,600 --> 00:54:04,800
to potentially set up my trust, I reached out and I think it was like $250 or $300 an hour.

613
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:13,440
And so I did pay that just to do an initial consultation. So what these guys are offering

614
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:17,840
is like, hey, get on a call, let's look at your situation, see where you can save some money,

615
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:24,240
see if you should set up an LLC. And anyway, I would just recommend if you guys want to make

616
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:28,640
professional money, as I said in the beginning, you got to treat this professionally. So this is

617
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:34,880
just a free thing that you guys can check out and then you can just go from there. And they

618
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:38,560
just literally just scan that with their phone and then they can put in their information.

619
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:47,680
I think I actually shared the link with you in our chat, Nick, if you want to share it in the

620
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:53,120
comments or something, because I don't know if I have that ability, right? And if you want,

621
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:56,720
we can give you the link, you can email us all of them or however you want to do it. But yeah,

622
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:00,720
the QR code is in the same place. It's just for us to grab the information so we can reach out

623
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:06,400
and just get you on the calendar. And then at the end of the day, man, it's like, yeah, we love

624
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:10,880
earning business. We love helping people and going ahead and doing the structures for them. We do it

625
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:15,040
all very affordably. But at the end of the day, we really want to provide enough value to where

626
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:19,200
if somebody even can't hire us right now, it's like, we still want to head you in the right

627
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:24,800
direction, give you direction this year to save as much money as possible so that maybe one day

628
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:28,720
down the road, you want to come back and consult with us a little bit more. And so it's not a high

629
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:33,920
pressure thing is all I'm saying. It's an awesome consultation, customized around you, your goals

630
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:39,120
for the business and show you how we can to show you how we can help you save money now

631
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:45,760
and down the road. So so I just barely dropped a link on the in the comments and I'll try to

632
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:51,040
include the link as well. I'll edit the live and post it there. But yeah, we'll try to like email

633
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:59,760
this out. Let me just see one more thing. Let's just answer two questions quick and then pop off

634
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:05,040
you can. Is that okay, Kale? And as you want, man, we'll answer any questions you have.

635
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:11,440
Okay, so real quick, Nick, Nick, I'm gonna ask this one because he's actually in St. George.

636
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:17,760
He went to Utah Tech and stuff. And he said, random question, is your firm well versed in handling

637
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:22,080
1031 exchanges? I'm seeking a reputable local firm to assist me in the process.

638
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:27,920
Yep, we can do 1031s. We do cost tags, real estates, one of one of the fields that we do,

639
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:31,840
we do a lot of work in and very, very well. Yeah, most of our most of our clients are

640
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:37,520
e commerce or real estate, you know, and so, yeah, we're pretty well versed in all of that. So

641
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:43,600
made absolutely. Okay, another one quick says, I set up my own LLC in Nevada and filed. This is

642
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:50,480
more just a comment. Nevermind. This is just stating something. What this is a question

643
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:54,880
that says from Juan says, What about creating a trust and having all the LLC inside the trust?

644
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:58,480
And it sounded like based on what you were saying is that's like when you get into the big money,

645
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:01,760
it's not necessarily right off the bat. But what do you want to talk about?

646
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:08,000
Very, very careful, because there's a lot of different ways that trust or structure,

647
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:13,280
there's a lot of different ways that the trust can own that business. And if it's done wrong,

648
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:18,880
you're going to wind up paying trust taxes, which is the absolute highest tax rate that there is.

649
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:24,240
And so that's one thing where great idea to be to be thinking at that higher level.

650
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:31,920
But do not like, please do not do that without a lot of consultation with a tax professional

651
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:41,440
and an attorney. Okay, I hope that answered. Let's see, Matt Torres said, he said, so starting

652
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:47,680
the business as an LLC first, then later converting to an S corp or forming an S corp separately is a

653
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:51,440
better strategy rather than leaving it as an LLC for the long run?

654
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:58,560
Well, I mean, it depends. Like, so for example, if you do have a business partner, or, you know,

655
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:03,280
like, let's just say you're a personal trainer, and you're an LLC, and then you meet somebody,

656
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:05,840
and they're like, Hey, we should build gym equipment together. And you know,

657
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:11,920
now you have a partnership and, you know, like, it's, it's, it's best to leave them all in LLCs

658
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:16,880
when you start involving other people. And then just forming a totally separate S corporation

659
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:22,400
that you now are flowing the money to. So for example, if me and Nick are in business together,

660
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:28,480
and we go create an entity together, but we have all these other things, it's, it's not wise for us

661
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:32,720
to go switch it to an S corp. Once it becomes profitable, it's wise for us to actually just set

662
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:39,040
up our own S corporations. And instead of flowing the money directly to us, now we float to our S

663
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:46,320
corporation, which is then where we pay ourselves. However, staying in LLC long term, that's totally

664
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:53,840
fine. Until if you're even if you're a single member, until you start making 30, 40, $50,000

665
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:59,840
a year and up, if then it's wise to switch it to an S corporation, right. And so, but

666
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:05,360
if you know, you're just entrepreneurial, and you know, I'm going to go start other companies,

667
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:11,600
I tell people it's best to just leave it in an LLC and go form a separate S corporation,

668
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:15,920
and start doing that flow right now. Because you already know, you're going to go create these

669
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:20,960
other LLCs, and you'd rather them all just flow to this S corporation. So, so it really just depends

670
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:25,600
on your goals and the situations. If you know, like, I'm not going to do anything else, this is

671
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:30,000
it, you know, then let's just switch that LLC to an S corp. You know, no, and you don't have

672
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:34,800
any partners in it. No sweat. You're like, hey, I know, I just want to make 15, 20 grand a month,

673
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:40,240
I'm good with that. You know, I just, you know, I don't want to have partners, I don't want it,

674
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:44,240
I just want to keep it super simple. Well, then we can switch it to an LLC, LLC, to an S corp,

675
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:48,960
and you get the same tax savings, you know. And so, so it really just depends on you, your situation.

676
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:56,000
But I hope that answers the question. It just there is somebody. Yeah, I think it just I think

677
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:01,520
if anyone has questions that specific like that, just jump on and talk to case and talk to kale,

678
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:06,800
they'll answer it for your situation. So it's pretty simple. The other thing, this is a side

679
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:13,280
note that I never realized is like, down the road, if you guys want to, you know, buy real estate

680
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:20,000
with your company or whatever qualify for certain things, when if you're LLC, or your business is

681
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:24,480
like brand new, I mean, it's really, really difficult. So you want to get it set up now,

682
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:29,760
get it seasoned, get however many years of tax returns, because they're going to look at a brand

683
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:34,480
new business. And basically, you know, they're, they're not even going to consider it. So

684
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:38,800
that's another thing that you you have to you don't even think about these things until you

685
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:41,760
get in a situation, you're like, man, I wish I would have set that up five years ago.

686
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:46,800
Yeah, I always tell people when you set up an LLC, and this is another whole benefit of why you

687
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:51,440
should set them up early on, instead of waiting, is because you can you go get a DUNS number,

688
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:55,680
you start building credit to your corporation. And like, you know, and there's a lot of misleading

689
01:00:55,680 --> 01:01:00,160
information out there, like, oh, yeah, once you set up, you know, you get corporate credit, you can

690
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:04,640
just transfer all the debts to the you know, off you to the business, and you're not liable to pay

691
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:08,720
them anymore. And it's like, that stuff's not true. There's, there's always like, a way it's

692
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:13,200
going to come back on you if you try and like, just walk away from a debt or something. But

693
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:18,640
there is a ton of benefits to corporate lines of credit, even if you are a personal guarantor,

694
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:22,560
there's loans you can get just through the company where you're not a signer on them.

695
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:28,160
And so and sometimes it takes a good couple years to really season an entity before

696
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:33,120
banks or institutions will give you money through the corporation. So anyway, that's another benefit

697
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:39,200
of starting to set up an LLC now is you can open up more lines of credit and access to capital

698
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:46,320
through that entity by starting to establish some credit through it. Beautiful. I'll say this guys,

699
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:49,920
and what I'll try to do, Kay, I'll try to get an email put together and send it out to everyone

700
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:53,920
that missed this. But the thing that I like about these guys, for everyone that's watching this is

701
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:57,840
that, you know, a lot of times you deal with accountants, or you deal with these type of

702
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:03,600
firms, it's just like that, that old guy that's friends with your dad. And you guys are actually

703
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:09,680
business owners that understand business and accounting. And so I think that's important,

704
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:13,840
because I've had you know, I had an accountant for a while when I got started, he used to do my dad

705
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:19,840
stuff on the farm and everything. And he was good, but you had to tell him, hey, what about this?

706
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:25,280
What about this? What about this? He was an accountant, he was just like one of those purists,

707
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:29,440
he didn't really know business, if I don't even think he was making that much money, although he

708
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:34,320
knew the accounting, he wasn't a business owner. So that's one benefit with these guys is they're

709
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:39,200
actually business owners that happen to know accounting very well. So anyway, we're going to

710
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:45,360
put together an email, I did drop the link. And we will, yeah, guys, just jump on, check out what

711
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:50,480
they can do. If anything, suggestions, if nothing else, you guys get some ideas and go from there.

712
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:52,800
Yeah, no, we appreciate it, man.

713
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:58,160
Beautiful. I'm sure we'll come. I'm sure we'll do another one, where we can just like maybe we can

714
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:02,960
gather a bunch of questions and just have like, I bet we could spend an hour just on q&a, which

715
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:08,000
could be a cool part to this. So I'll message you guys will chat and see. This has been really

716
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:14,000
beneficial. And I actually learned quite a bit. And I've been trying to piece this stuff together

717
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,520
for years. So appreciate you guys.

718
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:19,760
Well, it was a zoom call. So I was like, trying to bounce around.

719
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:28,320
It was good. You know, for sure. Well, don't appreciate you encasing up and on. And yeah,

720
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:34,160
guys, you feel that out. They'll reach out schedule a call and see, you know, what you guys some

721
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:39,040
of the next steps you guys can take if you choose to do so. So awesome. Thanks, guys.
