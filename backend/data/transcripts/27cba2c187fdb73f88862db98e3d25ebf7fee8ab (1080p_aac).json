{"text": " What I hold in my hands right here is the perfect prospecting script and before we jump into this because I want to talk about the breakdown I want to talk about the overview of this script which we're going to be using but before we talk about that I want to tell you how I came up with this script. This is not something that I googled this is not something that was a swipe this is not something that somebody gave me. This right here that I hold in my hands is the product of me knocking thousands not hundreds not tens thousands of doors door to door to door making thousands of prospecting calls doing at this point I probably haven't made a thousand zoom closes at this point but we're going to be there soon. A lot okay this comes from experience this is not something that somebody gave me okay so I want to tell you when I give you something I make sure it works first and I make sure it works thousands of times so what I did is I took my knowledge of knocking on door after door after door after making prospecting call after prospecting call after prospecting call what worked what didn't work I put it into a document and that is the perfect the perfect prospecting script okay so I want to give you the breakdown really quick it's a really really simple I want to give you the outline of what it is then we're going to jump into each individual step and I'm going to give you an actual example okay so it's a really really easy process okay this this script is a really really easy four step process with one at the end I guess you could consider a step but I want to go over those steps really really quickly okay so here's what it is is we're going to it's four things made up of four things number one is who you are and it's a pattern interrupt okay so these are things that are going to happen during the prospecting script okay during the hook who you are slash pattern interrupt and I'm going to explain this okay number two is what you're doing why you're calling guys you need to give them a damn good reason why you're calling okay you need to give them a damn good reason why you're calling them and interrupting their day step three the deal what's in it for you and what's in it for them okay meaning what's the win-win and by the way most people most salespeople to get this wrong and they focus so much on what's in it for them hey you get this you get this you get this and they forget to tell the business owner hey just so you know I'm gonna make money and a lot of it okay they're so scared to do that and they forget to tell the business owner that the only thing the business owner is thinking is what's the catch they like it they're in they're interested but they're thinking there's got to be a catch there's got to be a catch he keeps telling me good good good good good what's what's his motive okay so don't forget this part so what the deal so step three what is the deal okay what's in it for them and what's in it for you and I would say it's more important to focus on what's in it for you because they can clearly see what's in it for them step four is transition and one thing that's going to really really help you guys in these calls specifically the the hook process is your transitions okay there's times to pause there's times not to pause and we're gonna work a lot on our transitions and once we deliver our pitch how we can seamlessly transition okay so when I was doing door-to-door sales we would deliver the pitch and our transition had to be fire if we didn't transition well slam door okay same exact thing you guys don't transition well you're gonna get hung up on okay and then lastly we're gonna talk about the pullback which is we're gonna talk about what that is when to use it how often to use it it's an actual secret weapon so the overview guys just to recap one more time is this who you are slash pattern interrupt okay number two what you're doing damn good reason why you're calling them number three what is the deal okay what's in it for them what's in it for you step four transition and we're also gonna talk about the pullback that is what makes up the perfect prospecting script guys and I do want to share this there are people that have come through this program already that looked me in the eye and said nick I am terrified of the phone you have no idea and I said oh I get it man I get it no no you don't get it I won't even answer the the leads like this scares me this little piece of metal piece of plastic it scares me I'm terrified and I've watched those same people take this script take some hot leads that were coming in call a list of people who are already sold on the product and turn it into thousands upon thousands of dollars per month so if you're somebody that's sitting there going oh my gosh nick I'm scared welcome to the club okay everybody is but when you have the script when you have the right list and you got hot leads it's a total game changer let's go in", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 17.72, "text": " What I hold in my hands right here is the
