00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,800
Daniel says, should you start with backlinks or only use it as, quote unquote, nitro?

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,600
What would you, what would you say, Eugene?

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:13,040
Would you, would you start doing them or would you see how far you can get without and then

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,040
add them?

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,040
Or what do you, what are your thoughts on that?

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:21,480
I mean, that's a good question because, I mean, honestly, on a lot of the niches that

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,880
I do, like a lot of the traffic really comes from the GMB itself, you know?

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,800
So like, I mean, when I, when I got started, you know, we just went through the process

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:38,600
A, B, and C, A, do the website, get the backlinks and then like, then worry about the GMB and

10
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,600
stuff, right?

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,880
So, but now it's like, honestly, like I prioritize ranking the GMB first and then I'll come back

12
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,880
and I'll do the backlinks, you know?

13
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,880
Yeah.

14
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,880
So I don't know.

15
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:56,560
It's a good question, but I would say this, like, this is my thoughts is, if you have

16
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:01,360
somebody that's doing them and you have your, it's systematized and everything else, like,

17
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,320
I would definitely just start doing them from the get-go.

18
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,640
I would just make it part of the process, like Eugene's talking about.

19
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:12,720
For us, we have certain things, like we build a website, then we do the, you know, I'm not

20
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,800
speaking in order, but let's say we build a website, then we add the content, then we

21
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:20,160
do the page title, then we do the H1, then we do the description, then we do the, let's

22
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:23,680
say we jump to the citations and then we start doing the reviews and then their next step

23
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,600
is we just have a backlink structure.

24
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:32,240
It's like, but you know, it's just part of the process because we know that it's going

25
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,200
to speed it up and eventually we're going to be able to turn off the ad.

26
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,040
So in my opinion, I guess by saying that, I would say I would just do it.

27
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,600
I would just start doing it because even if you can rank without it, it's still going

28
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,120
to be an insurance policy for you.
