No, no, no, no. If you have a site that's getting leads and it fits the due diligence, passes the sniff test, go sell it.

Go, if you're struggling selling your existing sites because you did crappy due diligence or whatever, pause those, do SEO, come over here, follow my recommendations, concrete, tree service, foam and sprays from insulation, go and sell a presale, get your momentum.
