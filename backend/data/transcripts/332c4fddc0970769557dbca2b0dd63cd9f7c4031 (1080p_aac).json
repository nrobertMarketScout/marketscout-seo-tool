{"text": " So here's what you're going to do, Edward. I would make sure to do everything you can, get this sucker ranked, manage those expectations, and get ready to get that business owner into a sixth month to a year contract as soon as possible. What I would do is after month two, I would start, I would figure out maybe we need to bump up the ads a little bit. Maybe we need to like check in extra, whatever, because I know that between month two and three is when I need to renew. And if you don't renew for at least six months in October, there's a good chance they're going to cancel. If you go to a month to month, by December things slow down and it's Christmas and all these different things, it's going to be a problem. So what I would do is I would crush it for this person in both areas. In between months two and three, I would really up my game so that you can get those re-signs into the six month a year contracts. And then you could kind of take a little bit of a deep breath and go back to your strategy. But from experience, that's what I would do. Also a friendly reminder, guys, I would not be recommending a six month contract right now. August, September, October, November, December, January, that's going to put you in a really weird spot. You're going to have a contract ending at the end of Christmas. And unless you're in the snow removal niche and you're in a city that has snow year round, which I don't know if there are any, it's going to be a problem. So guys, I know the training says six month contracts, but we have to also use our head. Right now, I would do what Edward is doing. I would either do a three month or I'd do a nine month. I would definitely push for the nine month before the three month. But keep in mind, if you do a six month, the contract's going to end in the middle of the freaking winter and it's going to be a problem. It's really hard to renew contracts, relatively speaking, in the middle of the winter.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 3.36, "text": " So here's what you're going to do, Edward.
