WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.000
All righty, I think we're live, let me tell my music, sorry about that.

00:08.000 --> 00:25.000
All right, hey guys, let's see, we are here and live, cool, cool, hope all is well.

00:25.000 --> 00:28.000
What is going on with the internet today?

00:28.000 --> 00:37.000
All right, hang on a second, pain in the butt.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
I think we're back in it, sorry about that.

00:39.000 --> 00:45.000
I am having some minor internet issues, but here we go.

00:45.000 --> 00:52.000
All right, here is the Zoom, oh, that's the wrong one, let me back copy that, sorry.

00:52.000 --> 01:00.000
Let me give you guys the Zoom link here and let's get that going there.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
Let's kill that feed, okay.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.000
All right, so it should be good.

01:05.000 --> 01:14.000
Let me know if you guys can hear me here and then let me go onto my phone and update something here.

01:14.000 --> 01:34.000
Let's see, everyone.

01:34.000 --> 01:41.000
Go through.

01:41.000 --> 01:52.000
All right.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
Yeah, it went through, cool.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
All right, okay, sorry about that, guys.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
Okay, so I think we got the tag going.

01:59.000 --> 02:06.000
There is the Zoom link if you want to hop in and let me make the setting change here.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
That's already done, awesome.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
Okay, so.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
Hey.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
Hey, Todd, how's it going, man?

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
Good, man, how are you?

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
I'm doing all right.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
Of course, it is negative five degrees outside, so not great.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
Is it really?

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
Yeah, yeah.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
That sounds miserable.

02:27.000 --> 02:34.000
It's so weird, yeah, we're in Minnesota and it's like negative five today, by Sunday it's going to be 40.

02:34.000 --> 02:45.000
I'm wearing a sweater and it's like 68 out, so I don't mean to rub it in, but I am a Southern California baby when it comes to weather, so.

02:45.000 --> 02:49.000
Yeah, yeah, I went to college in Irvine, so I get it.

02:49.000 --> 02:57.000
Okay, yeah, I'm a spoiled princess for sure, so.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
Yeah, all right, what's up, man, what can we help you with?

02:59.000 --> 03:06.000
Yeah, I got a couple of questions, and I don't know if I'm still going through the training, I'm not sure if this is in the training.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
Keyword near me.

03:10.000 --> 03:16.000
Is that a legit keyword? I know it's expensive, but what do you think?

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
Towing, not towing, like tree service near me.

03:20.000 --> 03:37.000
So, okay, it depends on, like, in bigger cities, it's a very valuable keyword, and they charge, like, well, they're always going to charge a premium for that, and it's nothing, what's interesting about the near me is like, you and I never type that.

03:37.000 --> 03:50.000
That is always an auto filled world by Google, so when you're typing it and you see it, you're like, yeah, near me, like, yeah, of course, like, I want to go, you know, I want to get sushi near me, yes, near me, I don't want to drive 15 miles, right?

03:50.000 --> 04:05.000
So it's a premium term that's like auto populated typically by Google, so they charge a premium on it because there is like a little, like a location signal, right, like an antenna from your website or your address or your Google business profile.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
So they're always going to charge more for it.

04:08.000 --> 04:26.000
It's a very valuable word, so if it's in your budget to do it, what I would recommend is you running, if you're seeing a good or a decent amount of search volume for that term, I put the brackets around it to make it an exact match just for that term.

04:26.000 --> 04:41.000
But like, let's say for tree service, like, you know, doing a tree service as a phrase match will capture near me, but it won't capture it as fast as like an exact match tree service near me, and you can have both.

04:41.000 --> 04:58.000
Okay. And typically, you'll see a big difference between the two. Yeah. Is it necessary? It's not necessary. If you guys are targeting, you know, lower population cities and there's not like a crap ton of competition out there.

04:58.000 --> 05:11.000
When there's a lot of competition, that's where that's like that. That might be where I put that differentiation in of doing something that's going to have that a little bit, a little more dialed or focused. Does that help?

05:11.000 --> 05:21.000
Yeah, yeah, no, it totally makes sense. So, so, okay, kind of having an idea, do I need it if I'm in a high competition kind of area or whatever I'm doing.

05:22.000 --> 05:36.000
So that's the question I have to ask. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And it's not necessarily something that you have to have. It's just, it's a nice thing to have. Yeah. Can I show you, can I share my screen and show you my current deal?

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
I should be able to, it should be open to.

05:39.000 --> 05:49.000
How about that? You see that? Uh huh. Okay. So, this is a campaign, let's see, started just a little over a week ago.

05:49.000 --> 06:03.000
So we're just coming out of that learning phase. Yeah, yeah. So, hitting about only 375 and click through rate, nine clicks. I've had a couple of calls.

06:03.000 --> 06:14.000
In fact, I was working, trying to sell, trying to rent this out to a local guy, but I lost him. He was stuck on this Google ad thing.

06:14.000 --> 06:25.000
But as I go through here, and again, I'm pretty new with Google ads, the question I have under the ad group, I can click on ad group and then take a look at each of the terms, correct?

06:25.000 --> 06:36.000
Uh huh. So these terms are ones that Google is adding in the searches. Is that correct?

06:36.000 --> 06:41.000
So like here, let me get, actually, let me back that off. I don't understand that question. Okay.

06:41.000 --> 06:49.000
So like, let's go to like tree removal search terms.

06:49.000 --> 06:56.000
Okay, so these are under the search terms. I'm getting impressions on them, but I didn't, I didn't put these in here.

06:56.000 --> 07:04.000
Okay, so yeah, so there's a different, okay, go back to keywords. Let me, I think I can explain this to you in a better way.

07:04.000 --> 07:12.000
You're on it though, but okay. So when we, when we say like you have an exact match and you have phrase match keywords in there, right?

07:12.000 --> 07:22.000
Yeah. Okay. So obviously exact match, like tree removal is only going to be tree removal, but like tree service with a phrase match.

07:22.000 --> 07:35.000
So like typically any query within that area that you're throwing your ads to that has the term or phrase tree service in it is going to have the potential to throw your ad out to it.

07:35.000 --> 07:41.000
Okay. So it, so it's so the search term report, if you go back to that.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
What was I on tree trimming?

07:43.000 --> 07:49.000
Actually, if you think you can actually get it on your left, cause you're just, so you're just looking at it on one word right now.

07:49.000 --> 08:00.000
But if you just go, that's right. But look in the left column. Now go up, go up under insights and reports, go up, up, up right there. Search terms. See that?

08:00.000 --> 08:09.000
Go down a couple right there. That will give you all of them if you don't have it. So you have a filter turned on. So turn off the keyword tree trimming.

08:09.000 --> 08:29.000
Yeah. Get rid of that. So this will show you all of the search terms your, your ad is running to. So when you set up our ads, like it's really difficult to like, when you guys like all of us learn about what are better search terms and keywords as we get better at niches and we hone down on them and we get to know them a little bit better.

08:29.000 --> 08:37.000
But like when we don't know and we're just trying to see what's out there, we get that list of like our core keywords and we throw them out there as a phrase match. Right.

08:37.000 --> 08:45.000
And so with that becomes a little bit of like broad match is terrible. So phrase match is better.

08:45.000 --> 09:01.000
And so what you, but this is part of the first week and the second week is caving into your search terms here and getting rid of ones that you don't want your ad showing to. And a lot of them will be like, like able tree service. That's probably like that's a branded search term.

09:01.000 --> 09:18.000
You already excluded it. So those are like, that's what you want to do the first week. And what that does is that helps train your ad to start getting better for that second week. And you do this again. And then by that third and fourth week is when it really starts getting better results.

09:18.000 --> 09:37.000
And so over, over time though, let's say two, three, four months, like if you keep doing this and dialing in your ad and like you can get rid of, you can get rid of keywords. If you're like, this is just not producing or Hey, I got a bunch of like this, this and this, like three or four keyword searches.

09:37.000 --> 09:50.000
that I'm getting a lot of impressions for, I'm going to make those an exact match and add those to my keywords. There's nothing wrong with that. Right. Okay. But it's a little beyond like the beginnings of it. This is just as you get into it and learn it.

09:50.000 --> 10:04.000
Okay, yeah, that makes that makes sense, I guess. And I told Nick this on Monday, I'm just kind of impatient. So, so you know, eight days in, it's like, why am I not getting 10 calls a day? You know, so

10:04.000 --> 10:31.000
yeah, it's Google is I say this, like, they're the largest advertising company in the world. They're there to make money first. And at the same time, like, you can only imagine the billions of amounts of like, or attempts at fraud every day that they get. So like, they're all so a lot of

10:31.000 --> 11:01.000
times there are tweaks and adjustments could be a pain, pain in the butt to us. But they're doing it for a certain reason. So used to be able to kind of launch ads and within a couple days really get it going. And now it's like, that first week is just like, it's terrible. But it's designed so that what because what used to happen, a lot of people would do. So they would get an ad going. And as soon as it started, like, getting relevance and clicks, and this and that, people would go to the landing pages, and they would like redirect

11:01.000 --> 11:31.000
certain like links and stuff. And so Google's now like, I'm going to make you sweat it out for a couple weeks now. Right? They want to make sure you're legit, make sure nothing's changing. So it's kind of like, like I've been saying for a while with the group and on the office offices, like, don't like, you should really reduce your expectations for the first two weeks. This is just where you manage and massage your you massage your ad to point it in the better direction to fine tune search terms

11:31.000 --> 12:01.000
fine tune keywords, and make sure your butt because sometimes like, even a keyword planner, you're like, okay, this is this, here's the info, I'm setting everything up, then you go to launch it. And you're like, I'm getting my butt kicked. And then you go and like, kind of reevaluate. And you're like, holy crap, like that, that cost per click is like three times as much as what I just saw two weeks ago, that's sometimes that just happens. But that's why we try to spend those first week or two like, dialing in the ad, because then by week three, four and beyond, it's it's producing way

12:01.000 --> 12:03.440
better quality leads for you and your business owner.

12:04.120 --> 12:20.040
Okay, okay, that that makes sense. One last thing, still this. So instead of going down to campaigns and ad group to look at these search terms that they're adding or testing out, this is where I should go or should I because I or should I go?

12:20.240 --> 12:47.720
So they're not they're not adding or testing these out. These are people in that area are actually searching this into Google. And because you have tree trimming, because you have tree removal, because you have tree services, tree trimming, tree service, tree removal, like all of those are in phrase matches. And because they're in phrase matches, they're going to show up in those queries that people are actually typing in, in the area you're running ads to.

12:48.360 --> 12:58.480
I got it. Okay. So yeah, okay. So I'll go back through those and maybe for the next week, still keep chipping away at some of these.

12:58.480 --> 13:28.440
Yeah, and I would I would more focus like, I think you have some good words there for trees, like, I would more focus on, like, monitoring what search terms those phrases are showing up for. And part of that will be like, let's say you see a lot of like free or cheap or price or how to's or whatever, like you can add those terms into a negative keyword on your negative keyword.

13:28.480 --> 13:31.840
List. So if you want, I can quickly show you how to do that.

13:32.880 --> 13:40.160
Yeah, I think I know. So like tree removal search terms, let's say I pick one cost of tree removal, and I just add it right there.

13:40.600 --> 13:51.280
Yeah, yes. But okay, two things on that. That is correct. But that will add that 12345 word phrase as an exact match negative keyword.

13:52.240 --> 14:12.560
Ah, okay. But let's say that when you're inspecting all of your search terms, you see like, not like like how much might be something but like how to free cheap cost pricing, like maybe things you don't want. You can go into if you go to the left and go down to keywords. Oh, sorry, it's right here. You're already on keywords right here. So you're already on keywords.

14:13.400 --> 14:30.720
Here, go to the top and you'll see negative search keywords. See it? Okay, so these are ones that you've added. You see how they're bracketed. So those are exact matches, right? Yeah. Okay, but now let's let's go hit the plus sign.

14:31.600 --> 14:54.400
Now let's add down there. Let's write. Let's just do example, you can go through this later, but add like how to because you don't want someone to be like, you don't want your ad running to someone who types, how to, how to trim my trees, or how to remove my tree, you're like, I don't want to spend my money or you're right. Okay, so do like, just type in that phrase, how to

14:54.400 --> 15:24.400
as a bracketed. No, just type it in. How to. Good. Now go down. You'll hit save. Okay, and then as you go up there, did it save? Yeah, right. Okay, and see how it's a broad match? Yeah. Okay, so anything that says how to, and any phrase that like has tree service, tree removal, tree trimming, whatever, related to tree service, tree removal, tree trimming, whatever, related to tree service, tree removal, tree trimming, whatever, related to tree service, tree removal,

15:24.400 --> 15:54.400
it won't show. Same thing with the word free. Yeah. DIY. Yes. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So I don't need to do exact or phrase matching. It just well, I think that there's you got to do. I think there's a little bit of both. Like, if someone's typing in like, Kirk salsa tree service, that's a branded term, like I'll just throw it away because I don't want that competitor on there. It's an easy click and send it over. But if I'm seeing like, if I'm seeing, like,

15:54.400 --> 15:59.960
I'm seeing, you know, and you don't have to do this, because

15:59.960 --> 16:02.400
sometimes there's value in it, but it's up to you. But like,

16:02.640 --> 16:05.440
you have one that's how much would it cost to remove a tree?

16:05.680 --> 16:09.520
So that's a big, that's a big, exact match one, which is fine.

16:09.840 --> 16:12.320
But let's say that you're like, I'm getting a lot of like, how

16:12.320 --> 16:15.760
much or cost and I don't want my ads running to that. I want to

16:15.760 --> 16:18.800
run that for SEO or whatever. You can just type what you just

16:18.800 --> 16:22.480
did for how to you can do how much, how much you can do the

16:22.480 --> 16:25.960
phrase cost, you could do free, you could do DIY, you could do

16:25.960 --> 16:28.680
cheap, you can do whatever. And you could add those in the

16:28.680 --> 16:34.280
negative keyword list. And you could be that would be a valuable

16:34.320 --> 16:39.160
possible, that's a way to manage it. So if you go to search terms,

16:39.160 --> 16:41.360
and you're like, I don't want that one, I don't want that one,

16:41.360 --> 16:43.800
but oh, god, I'm seeing a lot of free or I'm seeing a lot of how

16:43.800 --> 16:47.440
to or I'm seeing a lot of like, whatever Home Depot or Lowe's

16:47.440 --> 16:50.440
or something, you could just type that you what I like to do

16:50.480 --> 16:53.480
when I do that is I like to get it, I just, I'm kind of old. So

16:53.680 --> 16:57.160
I'll just have a pad of paper next to me. And I'll just write

16:57.160 --> 16:59.600
it down. And I'll just write down those like little one or

16:59.600 --> 17:02.680
two word phrases. And then when I just add them, and then that

17:02.680 --> 17:05.520
way, I don't have to go through every single search term and

17:05.520 --> 17:08.560
decide if I want to click it. Because when I do that, it's

17:08.560 --> 17:12.640
just an exact match. So but if I'm like, well, how to is coming

17:12.640 --> 17:14.600
up a lot. So I'll just put how to and now I'm going to

17:14.600 --> 17:17.400
eliminate all of the how tos that can come up in the future.

17:18.240 --> 17:22.880
Oh, god. Okay. Yeah, gold, man. Thank you so much. That gives me

17:22.880 --> 17:24.760
some homework to do this next week.

17:25.560 --> 17:27.720
Yeah, and it's something that we go over. We've gone over a

17:27.720 --> 17:31.640
bunch of office hours, still trying to get a lot of these

17:31.640 --> 17:34.200
loaded into the training for you guys. And I know they're trying

17:34.200 --> 17:39.320
to work on a 3.0. And I think it's just kind of getting the

17:39.320 --> 17:42.960
videos done. But also, I think they might be moving to a

17:42.960 --> 17:46.040
different platform. And there's a whole security. So we're just

17:46.200 --> 17:48.760
in the background, we're trying to like, make sure that that

17:48.760 --> 17:51.840
stuff's good. So it might just take a little bit longer. But a

17:51.840 --> 17:56.040
lot of these things will come out eventually and be better able

17:56.040 --> 17:57.000
for you guys to find.

17:57.720 --> 18:00.480
So yeah, and I don't I don't know why the last couple of

18:00.480 --> 18:05.920
times, we were trying to figure out why the volume doesn't show

18:05.960 --> 18:11.560
I'm from Shiv's group. So I, you know, I don't when I when I go

18:11.560 --> 18:16.480
on to my, my master account for Google, I still I'm okay, I

18:16.480 --> 18:21.120
still see mine. But I know, you know, sometimes the the ranges

18:21.120 --> 18:23.440
don't show up at all. So

18:25.160 --> 18:27.920
well, I think that's last week, we were trying to figure that

18:27.920 --> 18:31.080
out. And I haven't had a problem with it. But so

18:31.760 --> 18:33.240
yeah, yeah. Okay,

18:33.240 --> 18:38.400
it's just, I'm really liking the rare right now. Because it just

18:38.400 --> 18:41.240
helps it just gets it all there. And it's really fast and easy.

18:41.720 --> 18:46.000
So I've been pretty happy with that. I'm still trying to like,

18:46.480 --> 18:49.720
you know, I'm still new to it. But I really like it. I think

18:49.720 --> 18:54.680
for you guys, it would be it'd be a lot faster, like due

18:54.680 --> 18:57.640
diligence wise for you guys, I think. And just to kind of like

18:57.640 --> 19:00.760
blast these things out. And what's nice is it's all in like

19:00.760 --> 19:03.960
a place where you can manage everything, which I will tell

19:03.960 --> 19:07.840
you that as I've progressed in this business over the years,

19:07.840 --> 19:13.320
like, man, having all of my stuff in one place. So nice.

19:13.360 --> 19:18.160
Yeah, I did the I did the trial and I loved it. I just I just I

19:18.160 --> 19:21.280
got to get some cash flow going in before I jump into that.

19:21.920 --> 19:26.600
Yeah, but yeah, very cool. Yeah, I'm that that'll be the my first

19:26.960 --> 19:29.360
first upgrade. So thanks, man. I gotta get to work.

19:29.480 --> 19:32.720
No problem. All right. Take care. All right. Hi, Cindy. How

19:32.720 --> 19:33.280
are you doing?

19:35.080 --> 19:36.480
Hey, Jeff. I'm good. How are you?

19:37.000 --> 19:37.800
I'm great.

19:39.400 --> 19:41.560
That was helpful already. I've been watching a lot of your

19:41.560 --> 19:46.120
videos. So I don't I don't have a specific question. Like, I

19:46.120 --> 19:51.240
have the answer. But I went into like a medium competitive market.

19:51.640 --> 19:55.960
Okay, as we had a business owner for that market, right. So my

19:55.960 --> 20:00.960
goal is to be number two there. And when I started the ads, it

20:00.960 --> 20:04.360
was great. Like the first, I don't know, three, four days, we

20:04.360 --> 20:08.920
probably got three, four leads for this. And now it's been like

20:08.920 --> 20:14.400
three weeks, and it's been like completely dead. So I changed a

20:14.400 --> 20:18.480
couple things, like, I first I set up some ads in like the

20:18.480 --> 20:23.720
neighboring areas that were less competitive, which is okay, like,

20:23.840 --> 20:26.840
they're kind of new. So I haven't seen much from that yet.

20:26.840 --> 20:28.720
And they're smaller populations.

20:28.960 --> 20:33.760
So let me stop it. So you expanded your ad area out.

20:35.680 --> 20:38.800
I actually set up whole new ad in another city.

20:39.400 --> 20:40.560
Okay. Yeah.

20:41.040 --> 20:44.400
Under under a different ad, whole different separate ad or

20:44.440 --> 20:45.760
under the same campaign,

20:45.920 --> 20:47.720
completely separate ad campaign.

20:48.200 --> 20:49.080
Gotcha. Okay.

20:49.280 --> 20:55.200
Yes. And then, and then Google got to me, because they were

20:55.320 --> 20:58.040
calling trying to tell me to switch to conversions and ad had

20:58.040 --> 21:01.000
been up for two, three weeks. And I thought, okay, maybe since

21:01.000 --> 21:05.040
it's not producing, I'll give that a try. So I know, I've

21:05.040 --> 21:07.440
watched a lot of your videos this weekend, never listen to

21:07.440 --> 21:11.200
Google. So I need to undo this. So I did, I switched to

21:11.200 --> 21:15.720
conversions on the main ad. And the next day immediately got like

21:15.800 --> 21:18.800
a call. So I was like, oh, maybe this is good. The call costs a

21:18.800 --> 21:23.560
lot of money, obviously. And they will maximize, they will

21:23.560 --> 21:27.040
maximize the crap out of your budget when you do conversions.

21:27.280 --> 21:31.960
So I guess where I need help is, can I go back like now I'm

21:31.960 --> 21:36.280
looking at that ad and all of my search keywords are gone except

21:36.280 --> 21:41.240
one. And it looks like it's hardly showing unless like, when

21:41.240 --> 21:44.600
somebody calls, then it just charges me the full budget. I'm

21:44.600 --> 21:46.640
not quite sure what happened. But should I just

21:49.200 --> 21:51.880
we might be able to salvage it if you can. You can share your

21:51.880 --> 21:55.760
screen if you want. And then we can. Sure. Yeah.

21:57.640 --> 22:01.120
Where do I go to? Oh, I see. I see. Yeah, I see at the bottom

22:01.120 --> 22:01.720
of the window.

22:03.040 --> 22:05.200
I see open system settings.

22:07.080 --> 22:09.320
Should just hit share and then yeah.

22:20.040 --> 22:21.520
You can't see it yet, right?

22:22.280 --> 22:22.840
Nope.

22:23.720 --> 22:26.640
Oh, I think I had to give okay to Chrome.

22:27.160 --> 22:29.560
That's okay. Yeah, there's like sometimes you even have to like

22:29.560 --> 22:32.720
restart it and all that. So if you do just I'll be here if you

22:32.720 --> 22:34.560
if you need to, it gives you a warning.

22:36.960 --> 22:40.160
Yeah, it's saying quit and reopen. Yeah, that's fine. Go

22:40.160 --> 22:42.800
ahead and do that. And I'll still be here. I'll wait. I'll give

22:42.800 --> 22:50.080
you 90 seconds. Okay, thanks. All right. Okay. All right. Let's

22:50.560 --> 22:54.920
see here. Okay, Cindy's gonna have to redo that. And we don't

22:54.920 --> 22:57.480
really have anyone else on. So if anyone has any questions,

22:57.480 --> 23:00.240
type them in the comments. Want to hop on zoom, hop on zoom.

23:03.120 --> 23:07.200
Otherwise, let's just kind of hang out here for a minute. And

23:07.240 --> 23:16.160
let me go through some of my DMs this week. Sorry. And see here.

23:20.080 --> 23:48.280
All right. And oh, wow. Okay.

24:20.080 --> 24:28.480
Sorry, someone's on. Hi, Jeff. Hi. Hey, yeah. Oh, okay. This is

24:28.480 --> 24:31.000
you. I'm talking to you. So let me get me to get rid of the

24:31.000 --> 24:35.040
other one. I have you twice. If this gets rid of you. I'm sorry.

24:35.080 --> 24:40.600
Hang on. If he gets gets rid of you, come back. No, you're good.

24:41.520 --> 24:47.320
Okay. Still here. Yes. Okay. Good deal. All right. You had two

24:47.320 --> 24:50.800
different views up there. I'm like, wait a second. That's

24:50.800 --> 24:54.280
okay. That's just because you restarted. It's all good. So I

24:54.280 --> 25:02.560
think it's working now. All right. Green share. Can you see

25:02.560 --> 25:03.600
my screen now?

25:03.600 --> 25:04.400
Yes.

25:27.320 --> 25:29.840
Okay, so yeah, can you see that there?

25:29.840 --> 25:33.400
OK, so yeah, can you see that there?

25:33.400 --> 25:34.800
Yes.

25:34.800 --> 25:39.920
So I've only got one keyword here for some reason.

25:39.920 --> 25:42.600
My negative ones are there.

25:42.600 --> 25:44.840
Hang on, go back to search keywords.

25:44.840 --> 25:46.920
Go back to that.

25:46.920 --> 25:50.040
OK, you have four filters turned on.

25:50.040 --> 25:50.840
I do?

25:50.840 --> 25:52.400
Yeah, so hit the three more.

25:52.400 --> 25:54.720
Do you see where it's at?

25:54.720 --> 25:57.760
Right there, see what you got turned on.

25:57.760 --> 26:01.800
Just hit X and see if you can get rid of those.

26:01.800 --> 26:04.360
No, OK.

26:04.360 --> 26:06.720
OK, go to where the little martini glass is.

26:06.720 --> 26:07.840
It has the number four on it.

26:13.120 --> 26:17.280
So you have it turned on to only show concrete point.

26:17.280 --> 26:22.200
OK, how do I turn that off?

26:22.200 --> 26:23.640
You should be able to.

26:24.480 --> 26:26.160
You should be able to where you're at,

26:26.160 --> 26:29.120
but it's not showing you that.

26:29.120 --> 26:32.080
Go ahead and click the ad group thing.

26:32.080 --> 26:33.240
See what that does.

26:33.240 --> 26:34.240
Here?

26:34.240 --> 26:35.760
No, no, no, where it gave you that.

26:35.760 --> 26:39.080
Did it let you click on anything when you click the?

26:39.080 --> 26:41.440
Yeah, if you go down and click one of those, go down.

26:41.440 --> 26:42.480
Down, down, right there.

26:42.480 --> 26:43.640
What happens when you click that?

26:43.640 --> 26:44.720
What does it do?

26:44.720 --> 26:45.920
It opens up.

26:45.920 --> 26:47.680
So now you want to go down and hit.

26:47.680 --> 26:48.720
You should be able to remove it.

26:48.760 --> 26:49.560
Remove this?

26:49.560 --> 26:50.560
No.

26:50.560 --> 26:52.880
You should be able to get rid of that filter.

26:52.880 --> 26:53.840
So I'm trying to get.

26:53.840 --> 26:56.280
OK, so you see how it has the X's,

26:56.280 --> 26:58.880
or it says Lakeland concrete, phrase match,

26:58.880 --> 27:02.240
like X on those little bubbles that are up?

27:02.240 --> 27:03.240
Up here.

27:03.240 --> 27:07.120
Yeah, hit X. Get rid of that filter, do the next one.

27:07.120 --> 27:09.040
Get rid of that filter, do the next one,

27:09.040 --> 27:10.600
get rid of that filter.

27:10.600 --> 27:12.440
There's our keyword.

27:12.440 --> 27:15.240
OK, so now you're going to go down and click on it.

27:15.280 --> 27:17.920
Do the next one, get rid of that filter.

27:17.920 --> 27:20.520
There's our keywords.

27:20.520 --> 27:21.800
OK, so they're still there.

27:24.080 --> 27:25.200
OK.

27:25.200 --> 27:32.280
So I can just go switch this back from conversions to clicks

27:32.280 --> 27:33.200
and get it going again.

27:39.400 --> 27:41.440
Yeah, you just go.

27:41.440 --> 27:45.160
Let's see, you're going to want to get into the settings.

27:45.160 --> 27:47.160
You should be able to just go to campaigns,

27:49.360 --> 27:52.300
and then go down to your search ad down there,

27:53.160 --> 27:55.640
and it should be a little gear, yeah.

27:55.640 --> 27:56.720
Let's see if we can do it from here.

27:56.720 --> 27:58.940
If not, we'll have to go to the top, but.

28:01.960 --> 28:02.800
It's right there.

28:02.800 --> 28:05.080
Bidding, where it says maximize conversions.

28:07.000 --> 28:07.840
Go down.

28:07.840 --> 28:09.860
Right below $20 a day.

28:09.860 --> 28:11.960
Now go ahead and change the bench strategy.

28:12.960 --> 28:14.780
Flicks.

28:14.780 --> 28:18.040
You want to set a max CPC.

28:18.040 --> 28:18.940
If you don't know what it is,

28:18.940 --> 28:20.920
just choose something for now,

28:20.920 --> 28:23.520
and then you can come back and change it.

28:23.520 --> 28:25.320
Is it okay to have it a bit higher

28:25.320 --> 28:27.240
if it's like a little bit more?

28:27.240 --> 28:29.800
I like to do a penny higher than what I see.

28:29.800 --> 28:31.920
That's my normal plan.

28:31.920 --> 28:34.520
Yeah, it's a penny higher than the highest.

28:34.520 --> 28:36.360
The top of the pitch.

28:36.360 --> 28:37.200
Okay.

28:38.320 --> 28:41.720
Yeah, I'm gonna go back and check that out later.

28:42.960 --> 28:45.800
Okay.

28:45.800 --> 28:47.120
And then I don't know, just in general,

28:47.120 --> 28:48.320
do you think like,

28:49.600 --> 28:52.640
should I just focus on targeting the neighboring areas

28:52.640 --> 28:55.420
that are smaller and see how that goes,

28:55.420 --> 28:58.400
or just spend more of the budget on the main guy

28:58.400 --> 29:00.480
and shoot to rank number two?

29:01.360 --> 29:02.800
I don't know.

29:02.800 --> 29:06.080
So I guess what I'm trying to understand is like,

29:06.080 --> 29:09.840
you have an ad set up in your main area,

29:09.840 --> 29:12.520
and then you set up, is it separate ad groups,

29:12.520 --> 29:14.760
or is it like completely separate ad campaigns

29:14.760 --> 29:16.600
to those other areas?

29:16.600 --> 29:18.780
Completely different campaigns.

29:18.780 --> 29:21.480
Different websites, the whole thing?

29:21.480 --> 29:25.520
Yeah, one website that's more specific to like,

29:25.520 --> 29:29.560
just DriveWife, and the other is general,

29:29.560 --> 29:31.360
but just to a landing page,

29:31.360 --> 29:33.600
because we possibly had another business owner,

29:33.600 --> 29:35.480
they both wanted the same area.

29:35.480 --> 29:36.960
So it was like, I'm gonna keep them separate,

29:36.960 --> 29:40.320
and then just in case like the, you know,

29:40.320 --> 29:43.400
BO number one doesn't want three areas,

29:43.400 --> 29:45.680
and maybe they're all producing leads,

29:45.680 --> 29:47.520
then I have someone else, right?

29:51.160 --> 29:53.140
Yeah, you can do that.

29:56.640 --> 29:57.680
Okay.

29:57.680 --> 30:00.160
I mean, if you're running,

30:00.160 --> 30:01.760
so you're running like three different ads,

30:01.760 --> 30:05.840
as long as you've done the math and they're all like,

30:06.840 --> 30:11.320
set up to optimize in those areas, you should be fine.

30:11.320 --> 30:13.240
I would just try to limit any overlap.

30:13.240 --> 30:14.280
That's probably the biggest thing.

30:14.280 --> 30:16.920
You don't want your ads competing with themselves.

30:16.920 --> 30:18.360
And I think they are.

30:18.360 --> 30:20.520
So yeah, I think I need to choose,

30:20.520 --> 30:24.360
like just focus on the bigger population,

30:24.360 --> 30:25.880
slightly more competitive,

30:25.880 --> 30:27.640
but that's where my business owner is,

30:27.640 --> 30:30.320
and like that was the initial campaign,

30:30.320 --> 30:32.480
and just put all of that there,

30:32.480 --> 30:34.160
or scrap it all together,

30:34.200 --> 30:36.560
and just go for the two on the outskirts.

30:36.560 --> 30:39.160
So that, but maybe those are still gonna compete

30:39.160 --> 30:43.200
with the other people advertising in the main city.

30:47.800 --> 30:49.960
I get, do you wanna look at your locations?

30:51.640 --> 30:54.800
Maybe we can see where you're overlapping possibly.

30:54.800 --> 30:55.640
Okay.

30:59.560 --> 31:01.720
So this one's Lakeland,

31:02.720 --> 31:05.360
and I think I have a radius set up.

31:09.280 --> 31:10.640
Unless I changed that.

31:11.640 --> 31:12.480
No, I do.

31:14.400 --> 31:16.080
You can still see my page, right?

31:18.080 --> 31:22.000
Yeah, so I've got, looks like 13 miles around Lakeland.

31:23.120 --> 31:25.600
Do you wanna see the actual map if I click on it?

31:32.720 --> 31:35.240
Okay, so are you writing a call only ad as well?

31:36.560 --> 31:40.080
So, no, I shut it off immediately.

31:40.080 --> 31:40.920
Okay, no problem.

31:40.920 --> 31:41.760
Yeah, okay.

31:41.760 --> 31:44.160
Yeah, after you posted on, I had posted,

31:44.160 --> 31:45.880
and you commented that you weren't a fan,

31:45.880 --> 31:47.720
so I shut it off.

31:47.720 --> 31:52.720
Yeah, when we were, that video is from when we were going

31:52.720 --> 31:56.480
from what were smart campaigns to this expert mode,

31:56.480 --> 32:00.880
and at the time, like everyone was like,

32:00.920 --> 32:02.440
at the time, like everyone in the group,

32:02.440 --> 32:04.960
it wasn't as many people, but at the time,

32:04.960 --> 32:07.800
everyone had been trained like a really specific way,

32:07.800 --> 32:09.680
and it was very, it was a lot easier.

32:09.680 --> 32:11.480
And now we're jumping into like the big boy,

32:11.480 --> 32:13.440
big girl territory of the expert.

32:13.440 --> 32:16.560
There's no like medium area for Google ads.

32:16.560 --> 32:19.080
So when we taught, it's like, hey,

32:19.080 --> 32:22.040
like call only is the easiest one to teach people

32:22.040 --> 32:24.080
because it's a lot more simple.

32:24.080 --> 32:27.360
So yeah, I kind of wish maybe we didn't do that

32:27.360 --> 32:30.560
because it creates confusion, but it is an option.

32:31.240 --> 32:32.800
It does work, but it works for like immediate,

32:32.800 --> 32:36.200
like I need help yesterday, or large areas

32:36.200 --> 32:38.880
where there's not a lot of competition type of thing.

32:38.880 --> 32:42.360
So, but anyhow, it's okay.

32:42.360 --> 32:44.480
All right, and one of those, like when you're trying

32:44.480 --> 32:46.480
to figure out what's the best way to roll something out,

32:46.480 --> 32:48.480
and later you're like, it probably wasn't

32:48.480 --> 32:50.280
maybe the best moment.

32:50.280 --> 32:54.360
No, it was fine, the business owner wanted calls.

32:54.360 --> 32:56.640
He's like, I don't like the forms, I want calls.

32:56.640 --> 32:58.200
So I was like, okay, but.

32:58.200 --> 32:59.360
Some people are weird with that.

32:59.360 --> 33:00.680
I don't understand that.

33:01.640 --> 33:04.120
It's like, I don't want to have money.

33:04.120 --> 33:06.280
I think when I replied back to you,

33:06.280 --> 33:08.640
it's just, I find that a lot of them,

33:08.640 --> 33:10.160
they just like, I don't check my emails.

33:10.160 --> 33:11.000
And I'm like, okay.

33:11.000 --> 33:12.960
So I just sent them a text and they're like, thank you.

33:12.960 --> 33:13.800
That's easy.

33:13.800 --> 33:14.640
I'm like, cool.

33:17.400 --> 33:19.360
Yeah, I think that's what it is.

33:19.360 --> 33:21.760
By the time you get there, they're not answering the phone.

33:21.760 --> 33:24.040
And I just got a call earlier.

33:24.040 --> 33:26.280
Yeah, and some of them, I will say this,

33:26.920 --> 33:31.280
over the years, I mean, sometimes there's people

33:31.280 --> 33:32.560
that are just really, really busy

33:32.560 --> 33:34.240
and their hands are dirty all day and they're like,

33:34.240 --> 33:36.720
I'm not getting on the phone, I'm busy.

33:36.720 --> 33:39.080
So sometimes that's like, okay, cool.

33:39.080 --> 33:41.640
Well, who else would you trust to get this

33:41.640 --> 33:42.640
and do these calls?

33:42.640 --> 33:44.720
So sometimes it's their spouse.

33:44.720 --> 33:47.440
Sometimes it's like, some of them might make

33:47.440 --> 33:50.720
some of them more legit guys and gals may have an office

33:50.720 --> 33:52.040
and they have somebody there.

33:52.040 --> 33:54.600
So sometimes it's just clarifying,

33:54.600 --> 33:57.760
okay, well, it's because you can't handle them right now.

33:57.760 --> 33:59.960
So who can handle them?

33:59.960 --> 34:01.960
And then let me point the forms to them.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.320
And then that sometimes helps because

34:07.040 --> 34:11.320
I have a couple of contractors that are clients of mine

34:11.320 --> 34:14.560
and they don't even wanna be bothered with it.

34:14.560 --> 34:18.960
So it goes to, one of them has an assistant that does it

34:18.960 --> 34:20.640
and the other one has a sales manager.

34:20.640 --> 34:23.000
And so I just funnel things that way

34:23.040 --> 34:24.640
and it works great for their business.

34:24.640 --> 34:27.040
And because the owner is at a place where they're like,

34:27.040 --> 34:28.120
I don't even wanna deal with that.

34:28.120 --> 34:29.400
I have people for that.

34:29.400 --> 34:32.600
So it's more of like, okay, who do I need to point it to?

34:32.600 --> 34:35.160
So, yeah.

34:35.160 --> 34:37.120
Yeah, we've got to dig a little deeper on that

34:37.120 --> 34:38.840
because like he answers the phone.

34:38.840 --> 34:43.680
Like if it rings, he's picking up and so he's doable.

34:43.680 --> 34:46.840
Maybe, yeah, maybe we can, someone had suggested,

34:46.840 --> 34:49.880
I think it was Jason suggested maybe we can like

34:49.880 --> 34:52.320
add on the service where a form comes in

34:52.320 --> 34:53.160
and then we call them.

34:53.160 --> 34:57.600
So now we give them the lead over the phone if they answer.

34:57.600 --> 34:58.440
So now-

34:58.440 --> 34:59.840
Yeah, you can do that.

34:59.840 --> 35:04.840
It just becomes, it's good to do that to get a deal.

35:05.640 --> 35:08.080
But it's something that you can like have

35:08.080 --> 35:11.360
as an additional cost, additional service costs to people

35:11.360 --> 35:12.880
because it's gonna cost you.

35:12.880 --> 35:16.760
But like just think about long-term scalability of that.

35:16.760 --> 35:17.880
It's not, yeah.

35:17.880 --> 35:18.720
It's not.

35:18.720 --> 35:21.040
It is, I mean it is, but you have to hire somebody

35:21.040 --> 35:22.880
at some point to manage that.

35:23.880 --> 35:25.600
Yeah, exactly.

35:25.600 --> 35:26.440
I get it.

35:26.440 --> 35:27.280
So, okay.

35:29.920 --> 35:30.760
So, yeah, so-

35:30.760 --> 35:32.800
Okay, so the areas.

35:32.800 --> 35:34.280
So areas, yeah.

35:34.280 --> 35:35.400
What do I show you?

35:35.400 --> 35:37.280
Do you want to see like the map?

35:37.280 --> 35:39.480
Well, are you running both Lakeland

35:39.480 --> 35:41.320
and 13 miles around Lakeland?

35:43.680 --> 35:46.440
Yes, because I think I had-

35:46.440 --> 35:47.880
Are one of them turned off?

35:49.240 --> 35:50.880
No, no, they're both on.

35:51.720 --> 35:54.040
I think I added the radius after when it went quiet

35:54.040 --> 35:56.800
because I thought I needed to expand.

35:56.800 --> 35:58.800
What's the population of Lakeland?

35:58.800 --> 36:01.720
Show me Lakeland on a map real quick, if you don't mind.

36:01.720 --> 36:04.520
I'm kind of familiar with it, but I'm like-

36:04.520 --> 36:05.800
I think it's 200.

36:09.400 --> 36:10.240
There we go.

36:10.240 --> 36:11.080
Yeah.

36:12.040 --> 36:14.040
Okay, what is that to the left?

36:14.040 --> 36:17.680
That looks like a metro area to the left there.

36:17.680 --> 36:18.640
What is that?

36:18.640 --> 36:19.480
Not Plant City.

36:19.480 --> 36:22.080
What's more like towards Brandon, Bloomingdale?

36:22.080 --> 36:22.920
What is, what's that?

36:22.920 --> 36:24.600
Beyond that, it's Tampa.

36:24.600 --> 36:25.920
Tampa's over there.

36:25.920 --> 36:26.960
Tampa.

36:26.960 --> 36:28.720
What's the distance, do directions

36:28.720 --> 36:30.840
between Lakeland and Tampa?

36:30.840 --> 36:32.120
How many miles is that?

36:33.360 --> 36:35.040
See on the left, you can just do directions.

36:35.040 --> 36:36.080
See right there?

36:36.080 --> 36:37.480
Probably like 40 minutes.

36:37.480 --> 36:38.920
Yeah, how do I, okay.

36:38.920 --> 36:40.960
Yeah, and just do that to like Tampa.

36:44.560 --> 36:46.640
I think it's like 40 minute drive.

36:47.640 --> 36:49.360
Oh, I'm right on, there we go.

36:49.360 --> 36:51.960
40 minutes, 35 miles, okay, cool.

36:51.960 --> 36:53.960
All right, and then Winterhaven

36:53.960 --> 36:56.400
is a suburb of Orlando, right?

36:57.640 --> 36:59.520
And Winterhaven is very close.

36:59.520 --> 37:02.160
It's like immediately to the right of Lakeland.

37:03.280 --> 37:06.640
And that's actually where my business owner is.

37:06.640 --> 37:07.960
Where, in Winterhaven?

37:07.960 --> 37:08.800
Yeah.

37:08.800 --> 37:11.360
Okay, I actually have two business owners there too.

37:11.360 --> 37:12.200
It's funny.

37:13.520 --> 37:15.680
Yeah, are you my competition, Jeff?

37:16.160 --> 37:17.760
I'm probably competing with you.

37:19.040 --> 37:21.680
No, I don't really mess with concrete, so you're good.

37:21.680 --> 37:24.040
Okay, because somebody's number one

37:24.040 --> 37:26.160
and I'm like, I know I'm not gonna be number one,

37:26.160 --> 37:28.400
but number two is wide open, so.

37:28.400 --> 37:30.320
Yeah, no, I don't really,

37:30.320 --> 37:32.920
I'm not a big fan of the concrete guys, so.

37:35.040 --> 37:39.320
Yeah, Winterhaven is, it's, where is it?

37:39.320 --> 37:40.760
It's to the right a little bit more.

37:40.760 --> 37:41.880
Yeah, right there.

37:41.880 --> 37:45.240
Yeah, so you're also really close to Orlando.

37:45.760 --> 37:46.600
Yes.

37:46.600 --> 37:48.960
Okay, because like Disney World's like right there, right?

37:48.960 --> 37:50.920
Yeah, you're up north.

37:50.920 --> 37:55.920
Yeah, so, okay, so when you go,

37:57.200 --> 37:59.520
so 13 miles outside of Lakeland

37:59.520 --> 38:01.960
is picking up Winterhaven and all these up,

38:01.960 --> 38:05.160
so you're, by blowing your ad out more

38:05.160 --> 38:07.760
than just those city limits right there that we see,

38:07.760 --> 38:11.400
you're running your ads to all of those other people

38:11.400 --> 38:13.120
in that region.

38:13.120 --> 38:15.640
So you could be at, so that will,

38:15.640 --> 38:19.240
that, if you don't adjust your budget for that,

38:19.240 --> 38:22.040
that's an easy way to like sabotage yourself.

38:22.920 --> 38:25.160
Okay, so maybe that was my-

38:25.160 --> 38:29.200
Yeah, yeah, so it's not that you can't run outside,

38:29.200 --> 38:31.720
you just have to just make sure that you understand,

38:31.720 --> 38:36.320
like in some areas where like Tennessee's a great example

38:36.320 --> 38:38.520
of a state where like you'll have a city

38:38.520 --> 38:41.800
of like 50, 60,000 people and that's like the big city,

38:41.800 --> 38:43.880
that's the town, the grocery store, all that,

38:43.880 --> 38:46.080
then you have this rural area around it

38:46.080 --> 38:48.080
for like 10 miles, 15 miles,

38:48.080 --> 38:51.680
and there's like a couple thousand here, five, eight, 10,

38:51.680 --> 38:54.720
there's not like 100,000 population

38:54.720 --> 38:56.440
somewhere next to that city.

38:56.440 --> 38:57.920
That's where like that rules,

38:57.920 --> 38:59.920
ruralness works for you to do that.

39:00.800 --> 39:04.280
But in areas like Florida, California, New York,

39:04.280 --> 39:07.160
except unless you're like way upstate New York,

39:07.160 --> 39:09.920
those are areas where like there's so many damn people

39:09.920 --> 39:11.680
that you just have to be really mindful of

39:12.520 --> 39:14.440
when I just throw out a radius to throw out a radius.

39:14.440 --> 39:17.480
I think like North Carolina and Georgia are like that too,

39:17.480 --> 39:19.640
because they're just not that big territorial wise,

39:19.640 --> 39:21.720
so when you throw out a map like that,

39:21.720 --> 39:24.200
you could easily like double the population

39:24.200 --> 39:27.760
without realizing that you just doubled the population.

39:27.760 --> 39:31.520
So is that, is it bad though if I'm maximizing the clicks?

39:31.520 --> 39:35.120
Like if my target is the biggest city there,

39:35.120 --> 39:38.440
which is Lakeland, and then when I throw the radius,

39:38.440 --> 39:39.760
like it increases population,

39:39.760 --> 39:42.680
because yes, it's adding the smaller towns,

39:42.680 --> 39:45.760
versus, so the other campaigns I set up

39:45.760 --> 39:48.400
were like Winterhaven and Poinciana,

39:48.400 --> 39:51.440
which is even more East, and I didn't put the radius,

39:51.440 --> 39:52.840
at least not at first,

39:52.840 --> 39:56.240
because I didn't want that to count Lakeland,

39:56.240 --> 39:59.720
but then it was small, I don't think I got any hits.

39:59.720 --> 40:01.880
Right, some of that is probably because like

40:01.880 --> 40:03.960
when you expanded that Lakeland one,

40:03.960 --> 40:06.560
you probably didn't increase your daily budget, right?

40:07.560 --> 40:10.920
I did a little bit, but like not enough to.

40:10.920 --> 40:13.240
Yeah, you just need to do, you just wanna look at,

40:13.240 --> 40:15.640
like if you go to the map and look at that radius,

40:15.640 --> 40:17.880
if you wanna go back to where the locations are.

40:17.880 --> 40:18.720
Sure.

40:18.720 --> 40:21.560
And then that, yeah, show that spot where the road,

40:22.600 --> 40:26.920
where the radius goes, not there on the ads, yep.

40:26.920 --> 40:29.120
Yeah, let's see what that looks like.

40:30.320 --> 40:33.440
Okay, let's zoom in on that and let's look at, so, okay.

40:36.560 --> 40:40.440
If I was to overlay that map with zip codes of that area,

40:40.440 --> 40:42.280
okay, so I want you to imagine that,

40:42.280 --> 40:45.360
that line, that 13 mile radius line,

40:45.360 --> 40:48.760
that's not like, that doesn't like cut through a street.

40:48.760 --> 40:51.400
If whatever zip code that's touching,

40:51.400 --> 40:54.160
you're running ads to that, a whole zip code.

40:54.160 --> 40:55.000
Yeah, it's pretty big.

40:55.000 --> 40:55.840
So you're actually, yeah,

40:55.840 --> 40:58.120
so you're including more people than you realize,

40:58.120 --> 41:01.680
because you probably are kind of touching a zip code

41:01.680 --> 41:04.880
possibly related to Tampa, maybe not.

41:04.920 --> 41:07.760
You're definitely running ads to pretty much

41:07.760 --> 41:11.400
all of Winterhaven, probably all of Lake Alford.

41:12.680 --> 41:14.160
Like, does that make sense?

41:14.160 --> 41:17.080
So like, even though we think, oh, okay, it's not,

41:17.080 --> 41:19.560
that line is not like a definitive line.

41:19.560 --> 41:21.280
Any zip code that line touches,

41:21.280 --> 41:24.040
you're running ads to that whole zip code.

41:24.040 --> 41:26.760
Okay, so yeah, so if you were,

41:26.760 --> 41:28.840
if you were gonna target this area then,

41:31.280 --> 41:34.400
so just knock out the radius and let it run,

41:34.400 --> 41:39.320
or together, like, should I just forget Lakeland

41:39.320 --> 41:42.000
and just go Winterhaven without the radius,

41:42.000 --> 41:46.560
Auburndale, Lake Alford, like just pick up the smaller guys?

41:46.560 --> 41:47.640
On my other-

41:47.640 --> 41:50.880
It seems like you have like another ad for,

41:50.880 --> 41:54.560
you said a whole other ad for Winterhaven and other areas.

41:54.560 --> 41:57.000
So you can run like individual ads.

41:57.000 --> 41:59.040
If you just wanna pick up like around Lakeland,

41:59.040 --> 42:01.560
there's that, there's a little city to the south

42:01.560 --> 42:03.080
and there's a little one to the southeast.

42:03.080 --> 42:06.120
Like, you can just add those cities into it

42:06.120 --> 42:08.960
and you'll see the map just kind of grab that city limit

42:08.960 --> 42:10.280
and grab the other city limit.

42:10.280 --> 42:14.600
That's a way to better control that just random radius.

42:15.480 --> 42:17.320
And, but keep it all in one ad.

42:17.320 --> 42:20.080
So you wouldn't exclude Lakeland,

42:20.080 --> 42:22.280
Lakeland because it's kind of competitive?

42:24.360 --> 42:25.360
Like I'm-

42:25.360 --> 42:30.000
I'm not afraid to, 200,000 is not that big of a deal to me.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.280
That's a good sweet spot, uh-huh.

42:32.280 --> 42:33.120
Okay.

42:33.120 --> 42:34.120
It's just that outside of that area,

42:34.120 --> 42:36.040
there's like bigger cities

42:36.040 --> 42:38.400
or cities that even have a hundred thousand people in it.

42:38.400 --> 42:41.080
So that's where you go, ooh, okay.

42:41.080 --> 42:43.120
That could get really expensive really fast.

42:43.120 --> 42:45.600
Cause now I'm running my ad to 400,000 people

42:45.600 --> 42:49.080
or 500,000 people, which isn't terrible,

42:49.080 --> 42:52.840
but I have to make sure my daily budget

42:52.840 --> 42:55.760
and my bids and everything else are aligned

42:55.760 --> 42:59.160
to be successful to run ads to that many people.

42:59.160 --> 43:01.040
Right, okay.

43:01.040 --> 43:02.000
Okay, thank you, yeah.

43:03.000 --> 43:05.560
We need to put it all into one ad because yeah,

43:05.560 --> 43:08.880
it doesn't make sense to have three campaigns going.

43:08.880 --> 43:10.440
I was like just trying to test it out,

43:10.440 --> 43:12.240
but now my budget is all over the place

43:12.240 --> 43:16.080
and it's getting complicated, so.

43:16.080 --> 43:19.680
Yeah, the only thing with that is like you'll have your,

43:24.400 --> 43:28.800
like Winter Haven's its own little spot

43:28.800 --> 43:31.120
and it's got a decent enough population

43:31.160 --> 43:32.600
that like maybe they're not,

43:32.600 --> 43:35.160
they may not respond to a Lakeland concrete site.

43:36.920 --> 43:37.840
Right. Maybe they will.

43:37.840 --> 43:39.800
So that's something, it's not that you can't do that,

43:39.800 --> 43:42.200
it's just a thing to think about.

43:42.200 --> 43:43.680
Okay, yeah.

43:43.680 --> 43:46.240
I would just run numbers, run numbers for both cities.

43:46.240 --> 43:49.040
That'll, the data directs me.

43:49.040 --> 43:52.560
So like if there's good population, good data,

43:52.560 --> 43:54.360
I can make some ads, there's competition.

43:54.360 --> 43:57.800
Like I might just set up a Winter Haven concrete site

43:57.800 --> 44:00.120
and go for another business owner.

44:00.160 --> 44:01.360
Yeah, okay.

44:01.360 --> 44:02.200
You know what I mean?

44:02.200 --> 44:04.600
Yeah, I guess I was getting kind of almost like panicky

44:04.600 --> 44:06.560
because he's already paying me.

44:06.560 --> 44:08.280
So I'm like, I need to produce, you know?

44:08.280 --> 44:10.120
Like I don't wanna lose him.

44:11.320 --> 44:12.680
I'm so sorry, but I have to run.

44:12.680 --> 44:14.480
I didn't realize the time getting late.

44:14.480 --> 44:15.320
That's okay.

44:15.320 --> 44:16.320
All right, no problem.

44:16.320 --> 44:17.520
Appreciate your help.

44:17.520 --> 44:19.120
All right, good luck.

44:19.120 --> 44:20.360
Thank you, bye.

44:20.360 --> 44:21.200
Bye.

44:22.120 --> 44:22.960
All right.

44:24.800 --> 44:26.360
Let's see here.

44:26.360 --> 44:29.960
Okay, Boya, I'm gonna,

44:29.960 --> 44:31.600
remind me how to pronounce your name again.

44:31.600 --> 44:32.440
I'm sorry.

44:32.440 --> 44:34.440
Hi, ladies.

44:34.440 --> 44:35.760
Ladies, okay.

44:35.760 --> 44:37.080
Did I say that right?

44:37.080 --> 44:37.920
Yes.

44:37.920 --> 44:39.880
I was like, there's like four ways to say that.

44:39.880 --> 44:41.320
I don't even wanna attempt to blurt it out.

44:41.320 --> 44:43.040
It's fine, it doesn't matter.

44:43.040 --> 44:44.240
That's okay.

44:44.240 --> 44:45.640
All right.

44:45.640 --> 44:47.960
And you were having issues with your,

44:47.960 --> 44:49.760
trying to set up your conversions, right?

44:49.760 --> 44:51.840
Yeah, so I'm new.

44:51.840 --> 44:54.840
This is the first time I'm gonna set up a campaign.

44:54.840 --> 44:55.680
Nice.

44:56.160 --> 44:57.840
Managers accounts.

44:57.840 --> 45:00.280
And I also have a Google account.

45:00.280 --> 45:01.120
Okay.

45:01.120 --> 45:02.760
I don't think the Google account,

45:02.760 --> 45:06.160
it's not a sub account, it's just a Google account.

45:06.160 --> 45:08.480
So I tried to set up a sub account

45:08.480 --> 45:10.480
under my managers accounts.

45:10.480 --> 45:11.840
Yeah.

45:11.840 --> 45:16.840
And I noticed that the questions that I get to set it up

45:16.880 --> 45:19.720
are different than the ones explained in the training.

45:19.720 --> 45:21.600
So I was like a little bit lost.

45:21.600 --> 45:22.440
I didn't know.

45:22.440 --> 45:23.640
Yeah.

45:23.640 --> 45:26.120
So maybe I can share my screen.

45:26.120 --> 45:26.960
Yeah.

45:28.640 --> 45:29.480
Okay.

45:31.480 --> 45:32.720
Yeah, let's do that.

45:32.720 --> 45:37.720
Yeah, and there's been some changes.

45:37.920 --> 45:39.920
And that's why I asked you if you can hop on

45:39.920 --> 45:41.440
because there's people that are,

45:41.440 --> 45:44.560
I've been getting more and more of these same questions.

45:44.560 --> 45:46.760
So what, I think I said it last week too,

45:46.760 --> 45:50.040
is like what I suspect is happening

45:50.040 --> 45:54.520
is that Google is rolling out a new interface for people

45:54.520 --> 45:56.320
and maybe a new setup,

45:56.320 --> 45:59.240
but it hasn't fully flipped across the board

45:59.240 --> 46:03.440
because I just set up seven new ads this week.

46:03.440 --> 46:05.920
I didn't run across what you're talking about at all.

46:05.920 --> 46:07.720
So it's like, okay.

46:07.720 --> 46:10.640
So it just maybe hasn't hit my interface yet.

46:10.640 --> 46:13.320
So, and these are like normal things that happens.

46:13.320 --> 46:16.000
Like it's not a huge issue.

46:16.000 --> 46:17.160
So, okay.

46:17.160 --> 46:18.560
Do you see my screen?

46:18.560 --> 46:19.400
I do.

46:19.400 --> 46:20.240
Okay.

46:20.240 --> 46:24.120
So the first, the initial problem I had like disappeared.

46:24.120 --> 46:25.080
I don't know what happened.

46:25.080 --> 46:28.960
So my initial problem was that it showed a screen

46:28.960 --> 46:32.200
where I had to enter like a sub page.

46:32.200 --> 46:35.080
I had to choose, first I had to choose

46:36.200 --> 46:37.680
the goal of my campaign.

46:39.880 --> 46:43.840
And I chose views, page views, like you told me to.

46:45.040 --> 46:47.880
It asked me to enter a sub page.

46:47.880 --> 46:49.080
I sent you a screenshot.

46:49.800 --> 46:52.280
You have like everything turned on though.

46:52.280 --> 46:56.360
It looks like YouTube, Gmail, search, display, discover.

46:56.360 --> 46:58.120
Like we don't want any of those.

46:58.120 --> 46:59.360
We just want search.

47:00.600 --> 47:01.560
Okay.

47:01.560 --> 47:03.400
So, all right.

47:03.400 --> 47:04.240
Let me...

47:05.560 --> 47:07.520
Can we go back to the beginning?

47:07.520 --> 47:08.360
Yeah.

47:08.360 --> 47:09.180
Just say discard.

47:09.180 --> 47:10.020
Yeah.

47:15.080 --> 47:16.040
All right.

47:16.040 --> 47:17.720
So I'm in my,

47:19.600 --> 47:20.440
I'm in my...

47:20.440 --> 47:22.280
This is a regular Google account.

47:22.280 --> 47:23.120
Manager's account.

47:23.120 --> 47:23.960
Yeah.

47:23.960 --> 47:25.560
I'm in my manager's account.

47:26.680 --> 47:27.520
Okay.

47:27.520 --> 47:29.440
So I'm going to go and set up a campaign

47:30.480 --> 47:31.600
or do I need to set up?

47:31.600 --> 47:36.600
Well, first I try to set up a sub account.

47:39.040 --> 47:39.880
Let me see.

47:39.880 --> 47:40.720
Where did I?

47:40.720 --> 47:41.560
Okay.

47:44.760 --> 47:45.600
Yeah.

47:45.600 --> 47:48.240
You know, the, like finding the sub account settings

47:48.240 --> 47:51.240
is also like different than...

47:51.240 --> 47:52.080
Yeah.

47:52.080 --> 47:52.920
Like account.

47:52.920 --> 47:53.760
Yeah.

47:53.760 --> 47:55.320
Hit account settings.

47:55.320 --> 47:57.120
Account settings.

47:57.120 --> 47:57.960
Wait.

47:57.960 --> 47:58.780
Account settings.

47:58.780 --> 47:59.620
Yeah.

47:59.620 --> 48:00.460
Okay.

48:02.920 --> 48:03.760
Yeah.

48:03.760 --> 48:04.580
Let me see here.

48:04.580 --> 48:05.420
Hang on.

48:05.420 --> 48:06.260
I just want to look at something real quick.

48:06.260 --> 48:07.100
Oh, so this is,

48:07.100 --> 48:08.480
this is my sub account that I made.

48:11.720 --> 48:12.560
Mm-hmm.

48:14.640 --> 48:15.520
Hold on one second.

48:15.520 --> 48:16.360
Okay.

48:21.480 --> 48:22.600
Okay.

48:22.600 --> 48:23.560
All right.

48:23.560 --> 48:25.440
Let's do this just because...

48:25.440 --> 48:26.920
Okay.

48:26.920 --> 48:29.240
This is a manager account and that's fine.

48:29.240 --> 48:33.260
There has been some changes to the MCC stuff.

48:34.480 --> 48:36.880
You would, since you don't have an ad already,

48:36.880 --> 48:39.440
let's go to the one above that, that 931.

48:40.000 --> 48:43.000
Let's just start with a regular Google ads account

48:43.000 --> 48:43.840
because what?

48:43.840 --> 48:45.600
There's this like thousand dollar limit

48:45.600 --> 48:47.880
that's really weird that Google's done.

48:47.880 --> 48:49.960
So, okay.

48:49.960 --> 48:52.320
Is this the account that you're asking questions about

48:52.320 --> 48:53.160
or this is a sub account?

48:53.160 --> 48:55.400
No, so this is, this is just a,

48:55.400 --> 48:57.600
now I'm in my Google accounts.

48:58.920 --> 48:59.760
Yeah.

48:59.760 --> 49:00.760
This is regular Google ad account.

49:00.760 --> 49:01.600
This is, this is fine.

49:01.600 --> 49:03.640
This is a regular Google ad account.

49:05.060 --> 49:05.900
All right.

49:05.900 --> 49:07.020
So I don't need to make a sub account.

49:07.020 --> 49:09.860
I just go straight to make a campaign.

49:09.860 --> 49:12.980
Well, we can, well, not here.

49:12.980 --> 49:15.900
This is, this was a campaign you already set up

49:15.900 --> 49:17.660
and it looks like it got suspended.

49:18.780 --> 49:20.140
Where does it say?

49:20.140 --> 49:21.980
Oh no, you know, you remember that I,

49:21.980 --> 49:23.820
that I know that's another camp.

49:23.820 --> 49:25.740
You remember a couple of weeks ago

49:25.740 --> 49:30.340
that I asked you how to see the exact search volume

49:30.340 --> 49:32.140
and you helped me set up a campaign,

49:32.140 --> 49:33.900
just like a fake campaign.

49:34.980 --> 49:35.820
That's the one.

49:37.980 --> 49:39.580
Okay.

49:39.580 --> 49:40.420
Oh, that's the fake one.

49:40.420 --> 49:43.260
But it's unsuspended, it's already unsuspended.

49:43.260 --> 49:44.100
Okay.

49:44.100 --> 49:44.920
All right.

49:44.920 --> 49:45.760
Okay.

49:45.760 --> 49:46.600
Okay.

49:46.600 --> 49:48.700
So in this account, you have something happening.

49:48.700 --> 49:51.660
You have a campaign, right?

49:51.660 --> 49:55.160
So this is its own individual account.

49:55.160 --> 49:57.940
Under the MCC, this would be considered a sub account.

49:59.140 --> 50:01.660
This is just a Google ad account.

50:01.660 --> 50:04.500
But this is not a sub account, right?

50:04.500 --> 50:05.820
Okay.

50:05.820 --> 50:08.340
This is a regular Google ad account.

50:08.340 --> 50:09.180
Okay.

50:09.180 --> 50:12.060
This is the same thing as a sub account

50:12.060 --> 50:13.260
and a manager account.

50:13.260 --> 50:14.100
Okay.

50:14.100 --> 50:14.920
All right.

50:14.920 --> 50:17.300
So as far as like the setup and all that stuff.

50:17.300 --> 50:18.140
Okay.

50:18.140 --> 50:20.020
What's happening in the, with the MCCs,

50:20.020 --> 50:21.780
the manager accounts is like,

50:21.780 --> 50:24.120
they're limiting how many ads you can create,

50:24.120 --> 50:26.100
how many sub accounts you can create up right,

50:26.100 --> 50:29.360
you can create right now until you hit a thousand dollars

50:29.360 --> 50:34.360
and another, another account under the Gmail.

50:34.420 --> 50:35.260
Okay.

50:35.260 --> 50:36.940
So what you'll wanna do is you're gonna,

50:36.940 --> 50:39.780
so for like your first, say five, six, seven ads,

50:39.780 --> 50:43.060
you're just gonna wanna set up individual Google ad accounts

50:43.060 --> 50:46.500
and then you can bring them by invitation

50:46.500 --> 50:49.300
under the MCC to be managed.

50:49.300 --> 50:51.380
Is that necessary or no?

50:51.380 --> 50:54.380
You don't have to, but at some point you'll hit like,

50:54.380 --> 50:56.980
I can't remember if it's 14 or 17.

50:56.980 --> 50:58.980
You can set up like 14 or 17,

50:58.980 --> 51:01.900
like Google ad accounts under one Gmail

51:01.900 --> 51:04.320
before you have to have another one.

51:04.320 --> 51:05.160
Yeah. Okay.

51:05.160 --> 51:05.980
But I'm not there yet.

51:05.980 --> 51:06.820
So. No.

51:06.820 --> 51:09.400
So for right now, this would just be more,

51:09.400 --> 51:11.960
it'll be, it'll simplify it for you for right now.

51:11.960 --> 51:12.800
And this is just something

51:12.800 --> 51:15.760
because Google changed some stuff on us.

51:15.760 --> 51:19.040
So we're just, this is the best way to adapt.

51:19.040 --> 51:21.400
It's one of those things we've covered on office hours.

51:21.400 --> 51:24.980
I've asked for it to be put into the training for you guys.

51:24.980 --> 51:27.040
So I'm just still waiting for it to get uploaded

51:27.040 --> 51:30.600
for you guys, cause I know it's something that's changed.

51:30.600 --> 51:32.480
I think like you weren't, I don't think you were on yet,

51:32.480 --> 51:35.360
but I've been where I know they're in the works

51:35.360 --> 51:38.580
of getting the 3.0 stuff done and dialed in,

51:38.580 --> 51:41.980
but I know there's been some like security issues

51:41.980 --> 51:43.000
and other things like that.

51:43.000 --> 51:44.240
They're trying to like work out.

51:44.240 --> 51:47.480
So can I ask you something?

51:47.480 --> 51:48.320
Yes.

51:48.320 --> 51:50.760
So how many campaigns can I make

51:50.760 --> 51:53.220
under this one Google accounts?

51:54.080 --> 51:58.240
It's like, I can't remember the exact number.

51:58.240 --> 51:59.080
Well, okay.

51:59.080 --> 52:00.740
Under this one, one.

52:00.740 --> 52:01.580
Okay.

52:01.580 --> 52:03.240
One to one website.

52:03.240 --> 52:05.780
So you can set up different campaigns

52:05.780 --> 52:08.820
as long as it's going to the same website.

52:08.820 --> 52:10.900
So let's say that you're doing like,

52:10.900 --> 52:11.820
I don't know which one this is,

52:11.820 --> 52:14.420
but let's say this is a tree one and you're like,

52:14.420 --> 52:18.100
well, I really want to focus on like a tree trimming,

52:18.100 --> 52:19.140
like whatever.

52:19.140 --> 52:21.660
And then I want to do tree removal or whatever.

52:21.660 --> 52:24.900
You can set up different campaigns to the same website,

52:24.900 --> 52:28.420
but you don't want to set up a new campaign

52:28.420 --> 52:30.920
to a different website under this one.

52:30.920 --> 52:34.300
You would create a whole new Google's ad account for that.

52:34.300 --> 52:35.140
Okay.

52:35.140 --> 52:36.640
So only in case, for example,

52:36.640 --> 52:41.640
I want to expand my ad to neighboring areas.

52:43.000 --> 52:43.840
Yeah, you can set up a-

52:43.840 --> 52:45.060
And I need the same websites.

52:45.060 --> 52:47.420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

52:47.420 --> 52:50.380
And otherwise I have to make a new Google accounts.

52:51.480 --> 52:52.320
Yeah, and that's easy.

52:52.320 --> 52:55.160
You just go to where your icon is, the A,

52:55.160 --> 52:57.840
and then you just go to set up new Google ads account.

52:57.840 --> 52:59.100
Okay.

52:59.100 --> 52:59.940
Yeah.

52:59.940 --> 53:01.500
If you have a full website,

53:01.500 --> 53:05.700
the other thing is if you have a full website,

53:05.700 --> 53:08.140
let's say you want to go to like your neighborhood

53:08.140 --> 53:10.300
to the right, to the east of wherever,

53:10.300 --> 53:12.420
you can just make a landing page.

53:12.420 --> 53:15.040
So let's say that I have like Jeff's Tree Service

53:15.040 --> 53:19.540
and I have like my main location is like Farmington,

53:19.540 --> 53:20.500
whatever.

53:20.500 --> 53:22.900
And then I want to go to like,

53:22.900 --> 53:24.740
I want to run ads and like, you know,

53:24.740 --> 53:26.180
Gold Beach or something.

53:26.180 --> 53:28.980
I just set up a landing page that'll say

53:28.980 --> 53:31.580
Gold Beach tree trimming services or whatever.

53:31.580 --> 53:34.820
And I just run my targeted, you know,

53:34.820 --> 53:37.220
if I want to target Gold Beach community,

53:37.220 --> 53:39.620
I set up a landing page and I just run my ads that way.

53:39.620 --> 53:43.740
You can set that up under here if you want to,

53:43.740 --> 53:47.940
as long as it all falls under the same big website.

53:47.940 --> 53:49.300
Does that make sense?

53:49.300 --> 53:52.020
So if I have a proper website

53:52.020 --> 53:55.900
and I make an extra landing page

53:56.300 --> 54:01.300
for the same niche but a different area.

54:02.380 --> 54:03.660
Yeah.

54:03.660 --> 54:04.500
I can do it.

54:04.500 --> 54:07.580
I wouldn't be like, I wouldn't run my like,

54:07.580 --> 54:11.540
I wouldn't jump off the bat and run like one in one state

54:11.540 --> 54:13.380
and one in another state.

54:13.380 --> 54:14.820
Cause that would be weird.

54:14.820 --> 54:18.060
But if it's like, if I'm in Farmington,

54:18.060 --> 54:20.400
I don't know where Farmington is, I'm just making it up.

54:20.400 --> 54:23.700
And Gold Beach is the community right next to it.

54:23.700 --> 54:24.680
That would make sense.

54:24.680 --> 54:27.160
If you want to try to expand in an area,

54:27.160 --> 54:28.400
that's one way that you can,

54:28.400 --> 54:30.680
that's one way you can do this.

54:30.680 --> 54:32.800
Or you can just set up many one-pagers

54:32.800 --> 54:36.000
and run individual, yeah.

54:36.000 --> 54:37.560
Okay.

54:37.560 --> 54:38.400
All right.

54:40.500 --> 54:42.760
So yeah, so I have this Google account.

54:42.760 --> 54:44.840
Can I just talk with you,

54:44.840 --> 54:47.960
if I start making a campaign that it looks,

54:47.960 --> 54:51.040
I suppose it's going to look more or less the same

54:51.040 --> 54:52.600
than what you explained in the training,

54:52.600 --> 54:55.840
but I'm not really sure.

54:55.840 --> 54:58.280
I think it has to do with the fact that my,

55:00.560 --> 55:03.680
my location is, I think my location.

55:03.680 --> 55:04.520
Yeah.

55:04.520 --> 55:07.860
I think the last time that, I think that's an issue.

55:07.860 --> 55:09.320
Yeah.

55:09.320 --> 55:11.600
I don't know about, it was the manager's account.

55:11.600 --> 55:15.200
I don't know about his Google accounts.

55:15.200 --> 55:16.040
Right.

55:16.040 --> 55:18.640
I think there's a,

55:18.640 --> 55:20.840
I really think that there is a,

55:22.800 --> 55:26.240
there's an interface issue with what you guys have out there.

55:26.240 --> 55:29.480
Like when I go here, like if I click website traffic,

55:31.080 --> 55:33.160
and it's asking you, like it's,

55:37.800 --> 55:38.640
I'm sorry.

55:39.480 --> 55:40.560
It pains in the butt.

55:40.560 --> 55:41.920
Like, okay, like here,

55:41.920 --> 55:44.640
it's asking you to like run a tag on your website

55:44.640 --> 55:45.720
and do all that.

55:45.720 --> 55:46.980
I just hit continue.

55:48.200 --> 55:49.040
And then what is it asking?

55:49.040 --> 55:51.240
The one action, I just leave it?

55:51.240 --> 55:52.080
Yeah.

55:52.080 --> 55:53.440
It just means, you're just telling it like,

55:53.440 --> 55:54.280
yeah, I hear you.

55:54.280 --> 55:55.120
I'm just going to ignore you.

55:55.120 --> 55:56.720
Okay. Okay.

55:56.720 --> 55:58.440
And then you go down to select your campaign

55:58.440 --> 56:00.960
and it's typically search, right?

56:00.960 --> 56:01.800
That's what we want to run.

56:01.800 --> 56:02.620
That's what we want to run.

56:02.620 --> 56:04.120
And then you hit continue.

56:04.120 --> 56:05.720
Just hit continue.

56:05.720 --> 56:08.440
Okay. Don't enter my website.

56:08.440 --> 56:11.720
You can name it if you want, whatever.

56:11.720 --> 56:13.720
It could be a tree tree or whatever it is,

56:13.720 --> 56:16.120
whatever you want to name it that you remember.

56:18.960 --> 56:19.920
Concrete.

56:19.920 --> 56:20.760
Yeah.

56:21.960 --> 56:22.800
Okay.

56:24.920 --> 56:26.520
Okay. So this is all,

56:26.520 --> 56:31.040
these are all the same steps that you encounter as well.

56:31.040 --> 56:33.160
Yeah. Go to clicks.

56:33.160 --> 56:36.160
And then I always set my maximum CPC here,

56:36.160 --> 56:37.640
but if you don't know it, don't worry about it.

56:37.640 --> 56:38.480
Just leave it.

56:38.480 --> 56:39.740
Just uncheck that box.

56:39.740 --> 56:40.580
You can come back to it.

56:40.580 --> 56:42.000
I can do it later on.

56:42.000 --> 56:43.080
If you don't have that data,

56:43.080 --> 56:44.340
I like when I set this up,

56:44.340 --> 56:46.060
I like to have the data with me.

56:46.060 --> 56:47.320
If you don't have the data right now,

56:47.320 --> 56:49.120
we're just kind of walking through steps.

56:49.120 --> 56:50.480
I mean, I don't have the data.

56:51.320 --> 56:52.800
Let's put it in.

56:52.800 --> 56:54.400
I mean, what do you mean with data?

56:54.400 --> 56:58.800
I mean, I have the CPC that is the minimum

56:58.800 --> 57:01.800
and the maximum that is mentioned in the Google ads.

57:01.800 --> 57:06.800
What's the maximum CPC that you saw for this campaign?

57:07.280 --> 57:10.280
The maximum was 1538.

57:10.280 --> 57:14.640
Okay. So I would put my max CPC at 1539.

57:19.200 --> 57:20.040
Okay.

57:21.320 --> 57:23.120
Is that a period or a comma?

57:23.120 --> 57:25.120
Sorry, I can't tell on my end.

57:25.120 --> 57:26.260
It's a comma.

57:26.260 --> 57:27.100
Okay.

57:29.360 --> 57:31.240
So this is, I just leave it like that?

57:31.240 --> 57:32.400
Okay. Yeah.

57:34.720 --> 57:37.840
You see here, I have to change.

57:37.840 --> 57:38.960
Okay. I know. I hear you.

57:38.960 --> 57:39.800
Hang on.

57:40.980 --> 57:42.720
We want to get rid of the search partners

57:42.720 --> 57:44.160
then display network.

57:44.160 --> 57:45.640
They're always going to auto fill that.

57:45.640 --> 57:46.760
We always remove it.

57:47.600 --> 57:48.900
Both. Okay.

57:48.900 --> 57:50.000
Okay.

57:50.160 --> 57:53.480
Now we go to look, enter another location, right?

57:53.480 --> 57:55.300
And then type in that area.

58:00.240 --> 58:02.280
That's 306 million people

58:02.280 --> 58:04.120
you're going to run your ad to right now.

58:04.120 --> 58:05.760
Oh, okay.

58:05.760 --> 58:08.080
Just type in the city and the state.

58:09.040 --> 58:12.160
I mean, you can, but I don't think $20 a day

58:12.160 --> 58:13.280
is going to help you there.

58:13.280 --> 58:14.120
Yeah.

58:18.240 --> 58:19.080
Right.

58:19.320 --> 58:20.160
Okay.

58:20.160 --> 58:21.000
All right.

58:21.000 --> 58:24.540
And then location, you're going to hit location options.

58:25.920 --> 58:27.640
Presence, people and or regularly,

58:27.640 --> 58:28.680
and you're included here.

58:28.680 --> 58:29.520
There you go.

58:29.520 --> 58:30.340
Okay.

58:31.480 --> 58:32.560
Language is English.

58:33.760 --> 58:34.840
Yeah. Yep.

58:34.840 --> 58:35.820
Hit next.

58:36.920 --> 58:37.760
Okay.

58:40.720 --> 58:41.680
And this is, okay.

58:41.680 --> 58:45.000
So this is something I'm currently exploring.

58:46.040 --> 58:47.640
This is it asking you

58:47.640 --> 58:50.920
if you want to just let them kind of run your,

58:50.920 --> 58:54.800
like, this is like allowing AI Gemini to,

58:54.800 --> 58:56.600
that's Google's AI is Gemini,

58:56.600 --> 58:58.860
to let them like set everything up.

58:58.860 --> 59:01.840
That's your headlines, your description,

59:01.840 --> 59:03.260
instead of how we have it.

59:04.600 --> 59:06.920
I'm like, I'm not convinced yet,

59:06.920 --> 59:09.080
but I'm not like, I don't hate it either.

59:09.080 --> 59:10.860
So I'm still trying to figure it out.

59:10.860 --> 59:13.800
So this is that where if you want to put your URL in,

59:13.800 --> 59:17.040
you can put it in and it might help you generate

59:17.040 --> 59:19.160
a bunch of headlines and keywords and all that,

59:19.160 --> 59:22.660
or you can hit skip and just do it manually.

59:22.660 --> 59:24.320
So it's your call.

59:25.560 --> 59:27.000
I'm going to try.

59:27.000 --> 59:27.840
Yeah.

59:42.240 --> 59:43.080
Okay.

59:47.720 --> 59:49.280
So you, you've done it before.

59:51.800 --> 59:54.260
What makes your product service unique?

59:54.260 --> 59:55.100
So I have to-

59:55.100 --> 59:56.200
Oh, interesting.

59:56.200 --> 59:58.100
All the ones I do, it actually pulls it in.

59:58.100 --> 01:00:00.940
So what you can do is go back to your homepage,

01:00:00.940 --> 01:00:02.660
your one pager.

01:00:02.660 --> 01:00:03.560
Yeah.

01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:04.480
Yeah, go to your one pager.

01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:06.400
Let's go down to what, what's your intro paragraph?

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:08.160
Let's just see what that looks like.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.400
Right. And then just copy that,

01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:13.560
like just copy and paste that into the description

01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:15.520
and see what it does.

01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:16.720
Yeah.

01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:18.880
Like a part of it or how much should I-

01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:19.720
Just the whole thing.

01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:21.400
Just the whole opening paragraph.

01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:22.240
Right there.

01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:23.060
Yep. Just that.

01:00:23.060 --> 01:00:23.960
There you go.

01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:25.920
Copy that and then paste that in there.

01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:28.800
Let's see what it does.

01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:32.240
Hit generate.

01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:36.640
And again, I don't know if this is like

01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:37.920
going to be awesome all the time,

01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:40.360
but it is something I'm kind of like interesting.

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:43.580
Now I'm not,

01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:46.320
I don't really trust them on all of their keywords.

01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:47.800
I don't know if that's going to be up to you

01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:48.960
to set your own keywords,

01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:50.240
set them up as phrase match.

01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:52.480
These are set up as broad match right now,

01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:55.200
but like, but we can, like we can just,

01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:56.400
let's just leave them for right now.

01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:59.120
You can do this later and then go down.

01:00:59.120 --> 01:00:59.960
Right.

01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:00.920
Okay. Just a question here.

01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:02.240
Yeah.

01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:04.960
Enter products or services to advertise.

01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:07.280
We don't have any that we're running services.

01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:08.880
Yeah. You can leave it blank.

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:10.800
And then another question about the keywords.

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:14.240
So the, the keyword that is in,

01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:16.640
that's having the most searches

01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:20.280
is concrete companies near me.

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:24.320
I don't see, so I can add it.

01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:25.160
Yeah. Okay.

01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:28.240
Is there a difference between the, for example,

01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:31.520
concrete companies and concrete companies near me?

01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:33.800
Is the near me making a difference?

01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:34.640
Yeah. Yeah.

01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:36.880
I talked about this with the first person today.

01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:39.600
So like, this is where,

01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:43.760
like no one types in concrete companies near me

01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:45.760
or concrete contractors near me, right?

01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:48.280
Google auto fills that for us.

01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:51.000
So when we're typing something and let's say that, like,

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.640
I don't know, what's your favorite type of food?

01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:56.720
Like your favorite type of restaurant to go out to, right?

01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:58.160
So whatever, let's say that,

01:01:58.160 --> 01:01:59.800
like if you're standing in the middle of somewhere

01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:01.200
and you don't know where something is,

01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:04.440
but you, you want that food, you're going to type in,

01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:06.360
like for me, it might be like sushi.

01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:07.600
I might type in sushi

01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:09.800
and it's going to auto-populate near me.

01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:11.120
And I'm going to be like, yeah, near me.

01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:11.960
I want that.

01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:13.880
I want to know what's near me, right?

01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:15.720
Yeah. So, yeah.

01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:17.760
Okay. Now remember this is,

01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:20.760
this is running as broad match.

01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:24.840
So we want to do either exact match or phrase match here.

01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:26.480
Okay.

01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:27.320
Okay.

01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:30.280
Yeah. You can go back through this later.

01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:31.600
Okay. Okay.

01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:33.600
All right. And then now let's scroll down

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
and let's see what it filled in for you.

01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:39.240
Keep going, keep going.

01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:41.480
Oh, it didn't fill in any headlines for you.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.320
Really interesting.

01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:45.720
Okay. What I think this is,

01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:49.680
is because it's a, because it's a one pager,

01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:52.000
it's recognizing Weebly.com.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.520
I bet you that's wrong, which isn't a big deal.

01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:56.520
It just means we just manually have to do it.

01:02:56.520 --> 01:02:59.400
So the AI may not be working for you guys right now

01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:02.680
because you're using Weebly.com, right?

01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:04.120
So much is fine.

01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:05.680
AI is not that smart yet.

01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:07.440
But I mean, this kind of sets you up,

01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:09.600
concrete contractors, concrete company,

01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:11.600
like you just, this is where you got to go back

01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:14.000
through the training and nail those things down.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:17.040
So then once you're here, you just kind of set it up.

01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:18.400
You just follow the training from here.

01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:21.320
But you can see how it didn't take us through

01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:24.360
any of those other steps that you were asking about earlier.

01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:26.840
And even that one with the page view, I just ignore it.

01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:27.680
Okay, fine, great.

01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:28.840
I'm gonna ignore you.

01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:31.720
All that is, is a tracking mechanism.

01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:35.000
The problem was I couldn't ignore it.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.680
I couldn't skip, I couldn't continue.

01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:40.080
I know, but I also, when I looked at it,

01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:41.160
you were trying to run ads

01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:43.000
to like five different Google platforms.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.840
So I think something happened in the setup,

01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:47.960
which is probably why it directed you to say,

01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:50.600
no, I need this, I need this, I need this.

01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:52.400
And you're like, I don't have it.

01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:54.280
Well, it's because you're probably,

01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:55.120
just like when you went in

01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:57.880
and it auto-populated display and partners,

01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:02.480
it's an easy one to forget, but that's most likely why.

01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:03.440
So.

01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:07.560
Okay, can I just, or as I go back to the keywords,

01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:12.320
that were mentioned, like automatically by AI.

01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:13.600
Yeah, I don't really trust them,

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:15.920
but you can just trust and verify.

01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:18.400
Just, you can look at them, but.

01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:19.400
Does it make a difference?

01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:22.520
I mean, do I need to be very, does it make a difference

01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:27.440
that there's like five keywords generated automatically

01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:30.560
and I don't think they're gonna show up?

01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:33.720
I am not, I have not been a fan of any of the keywords

01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:35.960
that the AI has recommended to me.

01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:36.960
I just delete them.

01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:38.680
I'm the expert.

01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:40.360
I know I've done my own research.

01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:42.480
I looked at the Google keyword data.

01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:44.600
That's the stuff that I'm gonna do.

01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:45.440
Yeah, okay.

01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:49.280
What I was saying is that I'm experimenting with it,

01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:54.280
helping me like maybe throw out headlines and descriptions

01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:56.160
and I can go, oh, I like those.

01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:57.760
Okay, those are great.

01:04:57.760 --> 01:04:59.800
I'm just, I'm experimenting with it.

01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:03.400
I don't know that I love it yet, but I'm trying.

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:05.200
There's other things I'm doing with AI right now

01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:06.520
that I've been very impressed with.

01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:09.680
So I'm trying to not be so old

01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:12.960
and I'm trying to be open to some new ideas.

01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:16.360
So it's just something to try, but yeah.

01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:17.640
So otherwise you just follow the training.

01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:18.480
Just do it yourself.

01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:20.280
Man, you can do it, follow it in.

01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:22.120
Yeah, okay.

01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:26.320
Just as far as their keyword ideas, I'm not a fan of them

01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:29.440
but you can also go, oh, I know I've actually seen it

01:05:29.440 --> 01:05:30.760
because you should already know your keywords

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:32.120
before you set your ad up.

01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:34.040
So it's like, yep, I'm gonna use that one.

01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:34.880
I'm gonna use that one.

01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:35.720
Nope, nope, nope.

01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:37.240
Yes, yes, yes, no, no, no.

01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:39.480
So I call that trust but verify.

01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:40.680
So just look at them.

01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:42.240
If they look good, yeah, oh cool.

01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:43.920
I was gonna run that ad anyways.

01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:47.520
Great, if not, I'm out and you're out.

01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:49.640
You just make your own like you should, right?

01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:50.480
All right.

01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:52.360
When is the next time that you're gonna be online

01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:53.560
just in case that I have?

01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:55.760
Good question.

01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:56.760
Let me see.

01:05:56.760 --> 01:05:58.280
What does next week look like?

01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:05.440
Tuesday'd be cool, but I know Nick goes on Tuesday mornings.

01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:10.440
So let's see, it'll probably be Thursday the 27th.

01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:13.040
I typically try to come on between 10 and 10.30 a.m.

01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:15.440
my time if I'm here in Los Angeles.

01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:18.400
So that works for me.

01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:20.240
Okay, all right.

01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:21.160
Thank you.

01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:22.480
Yeah, you're very welcome.

01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:23.600
Bye-bye.

01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:25.320
Bye, take care.

01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:26.160
All right.

01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:29.440
Let's see here.

01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:30.680
Hello, Jeff.

01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:31.680
Hi, how's it going?

01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:34.360
I'm good, I'm good.

01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:36.800
So yeah, I'm from, I'm in Australia.

01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:38.200
Okay.

01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:42.160
Yeah, I just, I mean, I don't think I have,

01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:44.960
there's no issues yet, but I just want to make sure

01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:49.640
whether I'm just on the, that I'm not doing anything wrong.

01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:52.520
So I'll just quickly share my screen

01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:55.480
because what's happened is, where's the share button?

01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:56.320
Yeah.

01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:01.760
Best of three.

01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:06.000
So in my, you know, the normal Google account,

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.840
so once again, just press the share button.

01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:11.560
Is it even sharing?

01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:13.160
It's not yet.

01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:15.280
I'm not seeing it yet.

01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:17.560
Yeah, because I'm just clicking the share button,

01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:19.120
but it's not seems to go.

01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:23.680
Okay, I don't know what's going on.

01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:25.320
I'll just explain it.

01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:29.680
In the normal Google account, I've spent more than $1,000.

01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:31.080
Okay.

01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:36.760
And now I have to pause the ad

01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:41.160
because my client here, she has gone on a holiday.

01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:44.160
So, but she is just going to start when she comes back.

01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:45.680
She's gone on a three week holiday.

01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:48.280
So the crew is not, they're not working.

01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:49.920
It's in the tree service space.

01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:54.720
Now that I, since I've crossed $1,000,

01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:58.000
I've gone back to my MCC account

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.880
and added this account as a sub account.

01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:04.200
Now I need to, when I try, like what I don't know

01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:07.360
is I'm also doing a due diligence on another area,

01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:11.280
which I'm looking to start the, start an add-on,

01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:12.920
but I'm not there yet because I'm not sure

01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:14.800
if that's, if I really want to go into there

01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:16.480
because of ICPC.

01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:20.680
In terms of like, when I try to look at, okay,

01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:22.080
just to see if I've got everything,

01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:26.960
it says I can't add like the payment or stuff

01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:28.800
seems to be there.

01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:31.840
Because I'm just not sure if my,

01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:34.920
if I can link the same credit card to my MCC account,

01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:38.840
like this, like how I've done for the other account.

01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:40.800
And do you think the card's be there?

01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:41.920
Yeah.

01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:44.720
Yeah, I have all of them set up on all of the same,

01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:47.080
either PayPal or credit card right now.

01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:50.200
When I have, I have multiple MCCs.

01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:54.120
I have, they're under multiple emails or multiple gmails.

01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:57.760
Like I very rarely, once in a while I get a problem,

01:08:57.760 --> 01:09:00.720
but for the most part, it's like, hey, what are you doing?

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:01.560
I just hit it.

01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:03.320
I just send an appeal and it gets appealed.

01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:06.720
So yeah, I haven't really had any issues.

01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:09.280
Okay, cool.

01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:11.680
I'll just try it and see what happens.

01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:13.960
I was just, it was slightly fearful

01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:17.080
the fact that it might ban me or suspend me or something.

01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:18.400
So I just didn't want that.

01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:21.760
You know, if it does, it's typically,

01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:24.880
it's typically just because like it,

01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:29.040
it happens so fast and it like,

01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:31.360
it might trigger just an auto like,

01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:32.520
oh, something's happening.

01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:35.880
So your bank and everyone just hits stop.

01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:38.280
And you just, typically those are easy ones.

01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:40.960
You just appeal and it comes back within a day or two.

01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:43.280
So typically that's what I see is that.

01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:44.360
And that's it.

01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:47.520
That is like, I mean, that could happen to me at the store.

01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:49.920
You know, it's like, those aren't really big issues.

01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:51.200
It's like, I get a notification.

01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:52.840
Hey, are you using your card?

01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:53.880
You're like, yeah, that's me.

01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:54.920
Okay, your card's fine.

01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:56.200
Go ahead and use it again.

01:09:56.200 --> 01:09:57.520
It's kind of the same thing.

01:09:57.520 --> 01:09:59.560
I wouldn't be too worried about it.

01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:00.400
Yeah.

01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:01.220
All right.

01:10:01.220 --> 01:10:02.060
Okay.

01:10:02.060 --> 01:10:02.880
Yeah.

01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:05.520
And generally with, when the client comes and says,

01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:07.800
I will go with chatting shop,

01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:10.400
we're going for three weeks holiday.

01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:12.840
I mean, my initial reaction was, yeah, of course,

01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:14.440
if you can't earn money, how can you pay me?

01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:16.520
So we'll pause it.

01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:18.920
I mean, I just said, I'll just stop sending leads to you.

01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:20.720
I didn't say all the other details.

01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:25.560
I mean, usually like, you know, if I'm doing this,

01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:28.520
if I'm earning money through this and that's my only,

01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:31.240
like, do you just say, yes, I'll accommodate that?

01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:33.200
Like generally for people.

01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:35.760
Have you had an instance like this

01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:38.760
where they've gone on holiday and you had to just stop it?

01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:41.880
Yeah.

01:10:43.900 --> 01:10:47.080
Yes, I've had, I've had, yeah, I've had, you know,

01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:51.600
you know, deaths in the family, you know, recently,

01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:54.040
like fires, like someone lost their home.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:58.680
I had a guy who like, you know,

01:10:58.680 --> 01:11:01.040
not saying this in a political stance,

01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:04.560
but like in our country, my country, like, you know,

01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:07.760
we're, they're like mass deporting a lot of people

01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:10.240
that are like undocumented workers and my friends.

01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:12.040
Well, I had a guy, his whole crew got clipped

01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:12.880
and got sent away.

01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:15.200
It's, and he's like, bro, I just lost my whole crew.

01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:16.160
I'm like, I got you.

01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:17.120
I'll hit pause.

01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:20.080
Yeah, it just depends on the relationship you have.

01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:23.520
Like I've had people now for like four or five years

01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:24.480
that are awesome.

01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:28.800
You know, so it's like, it just kind of depends.

01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:30.800
If it's like the very beginning

01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:33.560
and they're kind of like, kind of a difficult client,

01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:35.600
I'd be like, I'm just going to find, like, you know what?

01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:37.560
I got three weeks to find somebody new.

01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:39.440
Yeah.

01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:41.200
Like I'm firing you, you're just not worth it.

01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:43.840
But if they're a really good client and it's whatever,

01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:45.160
I got you.

01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:46.000
I got you.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:46.840
I'll see you when you get back.

01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:47.680
Okay.

01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:48.520
Yeah.

01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:50.120
Does that help?

01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:50.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:53.640
I mean, with this client, it's still early on.

01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:57.120
Like they've been with me for a month, solid.

01:11:57.120 --> 01:11:57.960
Yeah.

01:11:57.960 --> 01:12:01.600
So, but it's, and they just, and she didn't mention it

01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:03.800
even before I engaged, I brought her on

01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:07.920
that they might be going on holiday in late February, so.

01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:10.040
So it's not like a surprise or a shout out.

01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:11.200
Yeah.

01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:12.120
No, no, no.

01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:13.800
So, yeah.

01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:16.240
I just, see how it goes, so, yeah.

01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:17.080
All good.

01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:17.920
Thanks.

01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:18.760
Thanks for the word.

01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:20.240
Unless you're getting, oh, you're welcome.

01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:23.000
Unless you're getting like a weird vibe from them,

01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:25.760
it sounds like they were very upfront with you.

01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:28.960
So what I will say to that is like,

01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:33.120
what we should be charging these people

01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:35.120
is not all Google ad spend.

01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:38.280
So if you think this is going to be successful,

01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:40.880
whether with this business owner or there's others

01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:43.440
that are potentially out there, like, you know,

01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:47.800
in the future, I would be more like maybe,

01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:50.440
because you're trying to do SEO as well.

01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:51.280
Yes.

01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:54.560
You're like, I will say that,

01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:57.480
kind of thinking of something similar

01:12:57.480 --> 01:12:58.440
to what you're talking about,

01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:02.680
like I've reduced my monthly fee for people,

01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:04.800
but I'm still going to have you pay me while you're gone,

01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:07.440
because I'm still doing work on yours.

01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:08.840
I'm still doing things.

01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:10.840
Now, if it's the very, very beginning

01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:13.920
and you haven't fully moved into building a full website yet,

01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:16.760
and you're pretty much just running Google ads only,

01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:18.520
then maybe you could be like, all right,

01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:19.560
I'm just going to be cool about it.

01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:20.760
I'm not going to be a jerk.

01:13:20.760 --> 01:13:22.680
But like, as time goes on, let's say this,

01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:24.160
let's say you're with this client,

01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:26.120
this time comes around next year,

01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:27.920
and they're like, hey, I'm going on.

01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:29.240
You're like, that's cool, I got you.

01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:30.520
I'll tell you what, for the next month,

01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:33.800
I'll just reduce half your fee for this month

01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:34.640
while you're gone.

01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:37.440
That allows me to still work and do this stuff

01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:38.840
on your behalf while you're gone.

01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:41.920
But I'll turn off some of the paid stuff

01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:43.680
I have going da-da-da-da-da.

01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:45.120
And basically you're telling them like,

01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:46.720
I'll give that savings to you.

01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:49.480
Like enjoy a beer while you're out on me type of thing.

01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:52.040
And then, so that's setting up a good tone.

01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:54.440
And it's not like, right?

01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:56.200
Because we're not just running Google ads.

01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:58.280
Like your goal, the main play is SEO.

01:13:58.280 --> 01:13:59.120
Exactly.

01:13:59.120 --> 01:13:59.960
Okay.

01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:01.680
So in the very beginning, I can understand.

01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:02.920
You're like, okay, I'll hit pause.

01:14:02.920 --> 01:14:05.000
I'll see you next month, blah, blah, blah.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:05.840
No problem.

01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:06.680
Yeah.

01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:07.520
Okay.

01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:08.340
Makes sense, makes sense.

01:14:08.340 --> 01:14:09.180
Yeah.

01:14:09.180 --> 01:14:10.020
Awesome.

01:14:10.020 --> 01:14:10.840
Thank you so much.

01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:11.680
You're very welcome, man.

01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:12.520
Have a good one.

01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:13.360
Glad to see you.

01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:14.200
Glad to see your success.

01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:15.680
It's awesome.

01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:16.520
Thanks.

01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:17.340
See ya.

01:14:17.340 --> 01:14:18.180
Bye.

01:14:18.180 --> 01:14:19.020
Yeah, we'll see you later.

01:14:19.020 --> 01:14:19.840
Okay.

01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:22.680
Hi.

01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:23.640
You have more questions?

01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:24.480
I stayed.

01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:26.080
Yeah, I sent you a message.

01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:29.520
Yeah, just, I'm new to this.

01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:32.960
What I still try to understand with the Google ads

01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:37.000
is I did the training with Shift before.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:40.200
They don't work with Google ads, so this is new to me.

01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:42.600
What I'm still trying to understand is

01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:49.640
how come that we can spend less money on Google ads

01:14:51.740 --> 01:14:53.720
than the business owner?

01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:57.080
Because we're focusing on business owners

01:14:57.080 --> 01:14:59.000
that are running Google ads.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:03.660
So the sales argument that you're gonna have

01:15:03.660 --> 01:15:05.880
is you're gonna be better off with me

01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:07.840
than keep on running your own ads,

01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:09.560
or I'm gonna send you,

01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:12.200
or is it just I'm gonna send you extra clients

01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:14.420
on top of your own Google ads?

01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:19.720
I don't really understand yet what the...

01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:20.560
Okay.

01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:21.800
Have you had that objection yet,

01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:22.640
or are you just thinking about it?

01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:24.240
I'm not there yet.

01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:26.240
I haven't had a business owner yet.

01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:28.320
Okay, so, all right.

01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:35.480
So I would say don't get too worried about things

01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:38.760
that maybe haven't happened yet, right?

01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:42.160
And just think of it like this.

01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:44.720
If I was, I think you mentioned tree trimming.

01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:48.200
Let's say that I had my own tree trimming company,

01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:52.800
and I have my own website, I'm running my own Google ads,

01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:55.860
I'm doing my own SEO, and I'm killing it.

01:15:56.920 --> 01:15:58.040
Am I gonna talk to you?

01:15:58.040 --> 01:15:59.120
I'm probably not.

01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:00.120
No.

01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:03.000
Right, unless I'm like, hey, yeah, you know what?

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:04.880
I'm doing really well here,

01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:08.080
but I don't have enough time to go over here.

01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:08.920
Do you have anything in this area?

01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:09.760
No, I know.

01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:11.240
The business owners, for example,

01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:14.320
that I'm now listing, they have a Google ads,

01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:19.320
but they have a website on page 10, or something.

01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:22.560
But what I'm saying is if I'm running Google ads

01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:24.740
and I'm successfully doing it,

01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:29.680
I'm not going to talk to you, typically,

01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:31.080
because I'm doing it fine.

01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:32.480
Why am I gonna pay you for something

01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:33.320
I'm having success with?

01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:35.320
So you mean, okay, so you mean-

01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:38.160
It's the people that are running ads

01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:42.240
or paying some shit company, some shit agency, SEO,

01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:43.840
and they're like, yeah, I'm not getting results

01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:44.960
for these people at all.

01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:47.280
Those are the people we end up selling to.

01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:48.280
Okay, okay, got it.

01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:50.320
It's not the people, the people that are doing it

01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:52.760
and are successful and are kicking butt,

01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:55.280
they're probably not even gonna answer the phone.

01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:57.440
And if they are, it's probably gonna be like,

01:16:57.440 --> 01:16:59.200
oh yeah, yeah, I already did that, I don't have,

01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:01.520
I'm good, I already did a click.

01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:02.920
Unless that person's like,

01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:05.320
actually, I wanna expand to this area,

01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:06.640
but I don't have the time.

01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:08.240
Like, yeah, if you can do something for that,

01:17:08.240 --> 01:17:09.280
we can do business.

01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:12.680
Because that business owner understands it already.

01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:13.720
You're already pre-sold.

01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:17.160
So if they want something from you or want more from you,

01:17:17.160 --> 01:17:19.400
that's a business owner you can work with

01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:21.680
because they understand that you're an expert

01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:24.080
that's gonna go over here and do these things for them,

01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:26.360
and they understand the value of it, right?

01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:28.880
But the business owner that's comfortable

01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:30.960
with where they're at, they're not gonna talk to you.

01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:32.000
So don't worry about that.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:33.880
They're not gonna wanna buy your stuff

01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:35.920
unless they want to expand.

01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:39.280
So I have a guy, I had a guy,

01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:41.200
I shouldn't say I have him anymore.

01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:45.080
He's since retired, but like, he was,

01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:48.520
he did a lot of things,

01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:51.960
and he wanted to really focus down on one thing.

01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:54.400
And I was like, okay, so I was like his expert

01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:59.240
for that like silo, that type of specific service

01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:01.720
in his business and his overall business.

01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:04.600
And basically what he did is he basically had,

01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:07.520
he had a few people internally, and then he had me,

01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:10.680
and he had someone else doing some type of like

01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:14.160
social media, like retargeting, stuff like that.

01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:17.480
And I mean, the guy was probably spending

01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:19.240
80 to 90 grand a month.

01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:23.280
Like that guy was making millions of dollars,

01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:25.240
but he's also spending like 100 grand a month

01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:27.040
on marketing his business.

01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:30.240
So like that business owner understood it.

01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:33.360
He was fine with me coming in and buying the stuff for me.

01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:36.560
But those business owners, you might, you'll find them,

01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:39.520
but they're not typically who we're gonna sell to.

01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:41.280
Yeah, okay, okay.

01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:42.680
Typically the guy we're selling to

01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:44.440
or the girl we're selling to is the person

01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:47.840
that's like, you see, that's why we wanna talk to them

01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:51.080
because there's a barrier.

01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:54.280
If I'm just a guy who does concrete and you call me

01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:56.120
and I'm like, I already have a website.

01:18:56.120 --> 01:18:58.200
I don't know that stuff, click.

01:18:58.200 --> 01:18:59.400
We're not, good luck.

01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:01.680
You have to really convince me it takes a long time.

01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:04.560
If I'm like, yeah, I'm trying and I'm getting my butt kicked

01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:07.120
or I was paying these guys $5,000

01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:08.320
and they're not getting me anything,

01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:11.280
and I'm now a frustrated business owner.

01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:13.320
The thing about that is like,

01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:15.080
when you call me and talk to me,

01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:17.600
I'm either having a problem with it

01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:19.080
or I'm not.

01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:20.520
If I am, I'm gonna talk to you.

01:19:20.520 --> 01:19:22.440
And if I'm not having a problem with it,

01:19:22.440 --> 01:19:24.280
I'm not gonna spend the time talking to you.

01:19:24.280 --> 01:19:25.440
So don't worry about it.

01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:28.160
Don't worry about that objection that you have in your head.

01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:30.760
Don't worry about it because that person's gonna tell you

01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:34.000
no thank you or buzz off or I'm good and click.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:37.200
What about from your experience with business owners,

01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:41.360
do most of them run their Google ads by themselves

01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:44.040
or do they hire an external company?

01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:45.760
Hmm.

01:19:46.800 --> 01:19:49.600
I don't know how it is in the US.

01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:51.000
And in my country in Europe,

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.880
I would say everybody does it, they don't spend money.

01:19:53.880 --> 01:19:55.440
They're gonna do it themselves.

01:19:56.360 --> 01:20:00.040
I don't know in the US, the majority of the business owners.

01:20:00.040 --> 01:20:02.360
The small guys, yes, it's the same.

01:20:02.360 --> 01:20:05.080
I mean, I have a guy who I just picked up that's a,

01:20:07.160 --> 01:20:09.000
he's in Austin, okay,

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:12.000
which is like seven and a half million people.

01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:17.040
And he had an issue and he went on full panic mode

01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:19.400
and blew up his whole business on Google.

01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:21.920
Like, I mean, it's like, so when I'm talking to him,

01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:23.480
I'm like, you did what?

01:20:23.480 --> 01:20:25.000
Like, oh my God.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:28.760
So to unwind his mistake, like we triple charged him

01:20:28.760 --> 01:20:32.120
just to unwind his mistake because it was like,

01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:33.760
but that happens.

01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:34.800
But when we call him,

01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:37.400
we happened to pick him up on a day that he was like,

01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:41.480
yes, I need help, I am dying right now.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:43.520
He just didn't realize what he did.

01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:45.800
And those are the guys that have forever

01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:47.440
because they're the people that like,

01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:49.320
they are trying to do it themselves,

01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:51.440
but they don't understand it or they think they do

01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:53.720
or they call the Google ad specialists

01:20:53.720 --> 01:20:55.600
and they're like, okay, I'll do this.

01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:58.520
They don't realize that Google doesn't wanna help you.

01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:01.600
Google's main job is to make money for them.

01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:04.160
It's Google experts that you guys get emails from

01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:05.000
and all that.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:06.000
Those are salespeople.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.760
They get commission on how much money you spend.

01:21:09.720 --> 01:21:11.600
They don't care about you making money.

01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:13.320
They're not trying to make you money.

01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:15.520
They're trying to make themselves money.

01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:17.760
And it's not that they're, does that mean that they're bad?

01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:19.240
No, they just, that's their job.

01:21:19.240 --> 01:21:20.920
And you just gotta understand that like,

01:21:20.920 --> 01:21:22.120
that's their angle.

01:21:22.120 --> 01:21:22.960
Yeah.

01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:23.960
Yeah, okay, okay.

01:21:23.960 --> 01:21:25.280
Okay, got it, thanks.

01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:27.000
Yeah, no problem.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:28.320
Have a good day, bye.

01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:30.840
All right, you too, take care, bye-bye.

01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:31.680
All right, cool.

01:21:31.680 --> 01:21:33.480
All right, we've been on for a while.

01:21:33.480 --> 01:21:34.920
I'm late to my next meeting.

01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:36.800
So talk to you guys later.

01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:38.160
Hopefully this was helpful.

01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:39.760
All right, have a good week, bye.
