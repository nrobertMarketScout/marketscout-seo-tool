00:00.000 --> 00:15.480
Alright guys, it's time to close the deal and before we get into the script and we get

00:15.480 --> 00:19.080
into all of that, I want to share something, I want to give an analogy and this is the

00:19.080 --> 00:22.680
way I want you guys to think about the clothes, okay?

00:22.680 --> 00:27.400
And there's a reason why this module is actually fairly short, you're going to find it's relatively

00:28.080 --> 00:33.960
digestible and that is because to stress once again, the clothes happens in the setup.

00:33.960 --> 00:38.260
The way you do the setup, the better you do the setup, the easier the clothes and so that's

00:38.260 --> 00:42.400
why I want to show you guys that this part right here should be easy.

00:42.400 --> 00:47.400
This part should be you guiding them through the process, collecting the card and going

00:47.400 --> 00:48.400
on to the next deal.

00:48.400 --> 00:51.600
This should not be a huge thing, okay, if you've done it correctly.

00:51.600 --> 00:56.880
But I want you guys to think about baking a cake and so I haven't baked a lot of cake

00:57.560 --> 01:01.600
in my days and I really haven't baked that much at all, but I want you just to think

01:01.600 --> 01:03.900
about it because you can imagine, right?

01:03.900 --> 01:10.520
With a cake you have a recipe and the closer that you follow that recipe, the better the

01:10.520 --> 01:13.280
cake is going to turn out as long as the recipe is good, right?

01:13.280 --> 01:19.400
So I want you to think about the recipe being the process and the cake being a sale.

01:19.400 --> 01:25.460
So here's what's cool about this specific process is you have probably noticed as I've

01:25.780 --> 01:29.140
interviewed people and as people have come through this program, you've probably seen

01:29.140 --> 01:34.100
that most of them when I do the interviews, they say just flat out, yeah, I messed up

01:34.100 --> 01:36.500
70% of what I was supposed to do.

01:36.500 --> 01:37.860
I messed up 20%.

01:37.860 --> 01:41.680
I didn't do anything right and I still closed the deal.

01:41.680 --> 01:46.620
So the beautiful thing about this specific process, our process here in Flat View Mastery

01:46.620 --> 01:48.940
is you don't need to do it perfectly.

01:48.940 --> 01:51.300
You actually don't need to do it perfectly.

01:51.300 --> 01:54.980
All your goal is is you want to follow this recipe, which is the process.

01:54.980 --> 02:01.100
You want to follow it as closely as you possibly can and the closer you can follow the recipe,

02:01.100 --> 02:05.540
the closer you can follow the process, the more consistent your results are going to

02:05.540 --> 02:06.540
be.

02:06.540 --> 02:09.860
But what's interesting and what's crazy and what's pretty cool is that even if you don't

02:09.860 --> 02:16.420
follow it exactly, you will still more often than not finish the process, finish the recipe

02:16.420 --> 02:18.020
and you'll still have a cake.

02:18.020 --> 02:23.260
And that's what's so cool about this whole process is we've seen people who do everything

02:23.260 --> 02:24.260
wrong, right?

02:24.260 --> 02:28.260
They don't get both business owners on the phone and they still close the deal or they

02:28.260 --> 02:33.040
don't do the live transfer process correctly or they don't cover certain objections exactly

02:33.040 --> 02:34.740
how they should have.

02:34.740 --> 02:38.300
They don't do the zoom call at the right time, all these different things and they still

02:38.300 --> 02:39.300
close the deal.

02:39.300 --> 02:44.780
So I just want you to picture this, this entire process, but specifically this step.

02:44.780 --> 02:49.860
We're trying to follow this exactly as it's laid out because I've done it enough times

02:49.860 --> 02:51.260
where I know what the recipe is.

02:51.260 --> 02:55.620
I know that if you do these certain things, you are going to get a deal.

02:55.620 --> 02:59.220
So the closer you can get to following everything that I'm about to share and everything that

02:59.220 --> 03:04.860
we've shared, we've shared up to this point, the more likely you are going to have the

03:04.860 --> 03:09.460
same result every time, which is a nice, fat, juicy deal.

03:09.460 --> 03:10.940
Do the best you can.

03:10.940 --> 03:12.020
Don't sweat it.

03:12.020 --> 03:14.780
Just send it every single time and you will get deals.
