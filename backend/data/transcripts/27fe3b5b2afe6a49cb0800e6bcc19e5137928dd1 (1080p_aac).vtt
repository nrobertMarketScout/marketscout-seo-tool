Guys, welcome to module three, content is king.

00:09.360 --> 00:14.360
And before we get going, I just want to talk about why content is the way that we win.

00:14.360 --> 00:16.660
This is how we win is through content, okay?

00:16.660 --> 00:20.080
And if you guys remember back to one of the videos I covered in module one of the technical

00:20.080 --> 00:25.620
training, a part two of this whole digital landlords program, is content is one of the

00:25.620 --> 00:26.960
big three things.

00:26.960 --> 00:30.140
Content is one of the pieces of the 80-20 rule.

00:30.140 --> 00:35.240
You can do a lot of things wrong, and if you do a couple of them right, you're going to

00:35.240 --> 00:36.240
win.

00:36.240 --> 00:41.040
And so the reason why content is so important, as I mentioned, if you think about it, Google

00:41.040 --> 00:45.560
does not have millions of people that are just looking at websites and getting together

00:45.560 --> 00:49.160
and saying, this one should rank, this one shouldn't, this one should, this one shouldn't.

00:49.160 --> 00:55.480
They have an algorithm and they have bots that crawl, they crawl the websites.

00:55.480 --> 00:59.360
And these bots, they can't see, they can read text.

00:59.360 --> 01:03.360
And so it's interesting, people, like if you think about it, the only way Google can know

01:03.360 --> 01:07.840
what your website is about is by what is on your website, what kind of text is on your

01:07.840 --> 01:08.840
website.

01:08.840 --> 01:13.480
And you go look at most of these websites for Tony, the tree care guy, or Jack, the

01:13.480 --> 01:16.760
concrete guy, and they don't have any content.

01:16.760 --> 01:21.360
They have 20 words, 30 words, 40 words, they don't know that it's important.

01:21.360 --> 01:26.080
And on top of that, they don't want to do it because writing content is hard.

01:26.080 --> 01:28.160
Writing content actually takes work.

01:28.160 --> 01:32.000
Writing content requires you to use your head.

01:32.000 --> 01:36.200
So the number one thing is why it's important and why this is how we're going to win is

01:36.200 --> 01:40.200
because it is one of the big three things that matter with ranking.

01:40.200 --> 01:41.200
That's number one.

01:41.200 --> 01:46.240
Number two, other companies, other, especially these local business owners, they're not willing

01:46.240 --> 01:48.680
to do it and they're not doing it.

01:48.720 --> 01:52.960
If you guys have done your due diligence properly, going all the way back to looking for layups

01:52.960 --> 01:58.180
in part one of Digital Landlords, you will notice that the people that you're competing

01:58.180 --> 02:00.480
against are not big national companies.

02:00.480 --> 02:03.440
These are little teeny mom and pop shops.

02:03.440 --> 02:07.600
They probably went to GoDaddy, set up a little website, or went to WIC, set up a little website,

02:07.600 --> 02:11.400
or paid their needs so that if you set up a little website, these guys are not going

02:11.400 --> 02:15.860
to be hard to beat, but we have to beat them with content because if they have an old domain,

02:15.860 --> 02:18.040
we can't beat that.

02:18.040 --> 02:19.040
We can't fight it.

02:19.040 --> 02:22.000
We can't fake our domain size or our domain age, sorry.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.240
So content is super, super important because of those facts.

02:25.240 --> 02:27.400
So guys, this is super important.

02:27.400 --> 02:32.160
Instead of just moaning and groaning and saying, oh my gosh, I got to write the content, look

02:32.160 --> 02:34.800
at it as this is how we're going to win.

02:34.800 --> 02:39.480
And if we can get good at content, if we can get obsessed with content and getting good

02:39.480 --> 02:43.040
at it and good enough that then we can outsource it and we can have our outsourcers and our

02:43.040 --> 02:46.960
team and our virtual assistants write our content for us, this is how we're going to

02:46.960 --> 02:47.960
win.

02:48.880 --> 02:51.240
If we do the content correctly, we can avoid a lot of other stuff.

02:51.240 --> 02:53.040
We can rank much more quickly.

02:53.040 --> 02:54.680
We can avoid doing a lot of backlinks.

02:54.680 --> 02:57.200
We can avoid a lot of things, okay?

02:57.200 --> 03:00.680
And it's just like if you use the example of Kobe Bryant, right, I always talk about

03:00.680 --> 03:01.680
Kobe.

03:01.680 --> 03:03.280
Kobe was obsessed with the little things.

03:03.280 --> 03:06.000
He was obsessed with the things that other players wouldn't get obsessed with.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.480
He was obsessed with the angle he came off of the screen.

03:08.480 --> 03:10.300
He was obsessed with the crossover.

03:10.300 --> 03:13.720
He was obsessed with how he came out of a double team.

03:13.840 --> 03:19.360
Equally, if we want to get to that level, if we want to grow our businesses and make

03:19.360 --> 03:23.240
these more than just making a couple bucks here or a couple bucks there, we need to get

03:23.240 --> 03:24.240
obsessed with these things.

03:24.240 --> 03:26.720
And this is one of those things, if you take the time to learn it and you take the time

03:26.720 --> 03:31.720
to get good at it, it will pay dividends for every single project.

03:31.720 --> 03:32.720
Let's keep going.
