1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,720
Do you just run one campaign at a time?

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,560
I would recommend doing that until you get your first deal

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,240
or until you get comfortable with the process.

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,520
But once you get good at it,

5
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,800
I typically like, I typically am running about five at a time.

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,680
So I have, think about this, like once you get good at this,

7
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:19,680
I've got five niches, five one-pagers, five ads,

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,920
five business owners on the hook.

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,560
And I'm probably three to five, okay?

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,200
Because think about it, you know, let's take two of those.

11
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,200
It's taken a couple extra days for leads to come in.

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,920
One of those, it's working perfectly.

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,880
The other two, you know, it's kind of sporadic.

14
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,360
So I'm kind of running like, that's when I have a setter.

15
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,120
I'm usually running five at a time.

16
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,400
I can handle five at a time.

17
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,720
You're probably gonna,

18
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,560
I definitely recommend starting with one,

19
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,880
watching it like a hawk.

20
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,880
Once you close the deal and you feel comfortable,

21
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,920
and maybe you can go to two.

22
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,400
I mean, you gotta be careful, you don't waste money,

23
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,360
you don't waste leads.

24
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,920
But once you get good at it, man, the sky is the limit.

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,160
That's what's freaking amazing about this, okay?

26
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,000
Cool.
