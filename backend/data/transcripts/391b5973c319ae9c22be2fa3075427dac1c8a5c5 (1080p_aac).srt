If you want to build confidence, I know a lot of people that are very attractive that don't have shit for confidence so it ain't about being attractive okay.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:17,000
In fact, I think that that doing hard shit and being confident is the thing that makes you attractive it's not being attractive that makes you confident okay.

00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It's not about driving a fancy car. It's not about being in, you know, prime shape, all these things help and all these things are things that I do because they add to it.

00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
If you're sitting there right now and you're at a four.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
If you're at a six if you're at not a 10.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The number one thing that you can do to build confidence is consistently do hard shit.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:54,000
That's going to move the needle that you know you need to do when you said you were going to do it and again, defining the hard shit as those things that you know you need to do that the things that need to be done to move the needle.

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
And they're most often the most uncomfortable they're most often the things that scare you.
