1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,320
Guys, before we get into the actual zoom, what we're going to do, I want to talk really

2
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,000
quickly about best practices.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,620
These are some things that if you will do these, you're going to increase your odds

4
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:22,660
and likelihood of getting the deal, okay?

5
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,120
You're not going to do these perfectly every time you're going to forget.

6
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,100
It's not going to be possible sometimes.

7
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:31,020
You're just going to do the best that you can given what you have to work with, okay?

8
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:35,420
I want to give you an example of where I learned this and how effective this was.

9
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:39,420
Back when I did door-to-door sales, they taught me, my managers at the time, they taught me

10
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,060
something really interesting.

11
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,580
They said the closer, the same thing that we're talking about here, but they taught

12
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,500
me some specific technical things to do.

13
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,540
They were like, hey, the closer you follow these specific things, the more likely you're

14
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:50,980
going to be to get the deal.

15
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:55,700
I became very rigid, very disciplined of doing these things because it always led to a sale,

16
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:56,700
okay?

17
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,740
Let me give you one example.

18
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:02,500
One thing that we always did and we were taught to do is when you go in the home, they said,

19
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,420
hey, when you go in the house, the first thing you're going to do is you're going to identify

20
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:07,420
the kitchen table.

21
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:10,100
You're going to go over to the kitchen table, you're going to take your binder and your

22
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:13,660
iPad, you're going to set it right at the kitchen table exactly where it's going to

23
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:17,460
be the best place to talk to both the husband and wife, okay?

24
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,680
Or both spouses or both partners, whatever.

25
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:26,300
The reason why you do this is because business is more likely to happen at the kitchen table

26
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,540
than at the couch.

27
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,540
And statistically speaking, if you sit at the couch, people are going to be relaxed,

28
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,220
they're going to be distracted, and they just think that they're talking or just talking

29
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,100
about the overall concept, but we're not getting down to business.

30
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,260
But when you sit at the kitchen table, people know that you mean business.

31
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:45,100
You're there to look at stuff, you're there to sign papers, you are doing a deal at the

32
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,280
kitchen table.

33
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,540
So since business happens at the kitchen table, not the couch, avoid the couch at all measures.

34
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:53,860
Go put the binder at the kitchen table and you will close more deals.

35
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:58,220
I did everything I could to make sure that was the case.

36
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:01,180
And I will tell you, there were some times they didn't have a kitchen table.

37
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:05,080
In a few instances, there was no kitchen table, so I did the best that I could.

38
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:10,300
There was a few times when they were insistent that we sit at the couch because the husband

39
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:14,020
was in a wheelchair or the kitchen table was full of stuff.

40
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,820
But even when it was full of stuff, I would just say, hey, it's fine, let's just push

41
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:17,820
some stuff to the side.

42
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:20,180
Like there was times there was mounds of stuff, right?

43
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,860
Disgusting, like syrup on the counter.

44
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:26,660
I would still sit at the kitchen table because I knew that's where deals happen.

45
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:27,980
So that's just one example.

46
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:31,720
So the equivalent of that with our deals are the following.

47
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,980
First of all, the time of day that you schedule the Zoom call.

48
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,620
It does matter.

49
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:40,860
And what happens is if you leave this up to chance and you just say, hey, business owner,

50
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,980
what time works for you?

51
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,780
That is a bad question because they're going to give you a terrible option.

52
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,540
They're going to say, well, I have a little lunch break here, here, here, and here.

53
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,000
Well, let me tell you about lunch breaks.

54
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,360
First of all, you know, as a business owner, they typically don't happen, number one.

55
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,160
Number two, the day gets going and the lunch break that was supposed to be an hour becomes

56
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,880
10 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, and they're rushed, right?

57
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,480
They're in the middle of the day, they're getting calls, they're getting inquiries.

58
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,820
They're trying to make money just like you.

59
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,520
And so, and on top of that, like imagine they're sitting at a diner, they're sitting at a fast

60
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,960
food restaurant and they're FaceTiming you from their phone.

61
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,560
Again, guys, that is not the best case scenario.

62
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,900
So here's a best practice as far as the time.

63
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:27,920
Try and do it first thing in the morning or late at night, okay?

64
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,000
That's what I have found to be the most effective and morning is definitely the best.

65
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,880
For me, it's best because I wake up, I'm fresh, I get a deal before I even go to the gym,

66
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:40,960
but also for them because they're not distracted, they're not getting hit up yet, so I like

67
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,960
early in the morning.

68
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,200
It's my favorite thing to do.

69
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,600
Secondly, I like to make sure to tell them, hey, be by a computer.

70
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,120
Now, the reason I justify it is I say, hey, I'm going to want to show you a couple things.

71
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,480
It's going to be really hard for you to see on your tiny phone.

72
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,080
So if you could be by a desktop, that would be perfect.

73
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,880
Or a laptop, be somewhere quiet by a laptop because I want to show you some things and

74
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:06,000
I'll usually tell them, hey, if we can do that, it's going to go a lot faster.

75
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,720
And really the reason why is I don't want them calling me from a cell phone where they're

76
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,100
going to be distracted, stuff's going to be coming in or they're going to feel like they

77
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:16,160
can just call me from a grocery parking lot or a gas station.

78
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,920
Guys, I've had somebody, because I didn't do this, they were going to buy dog food and

79
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,320
thought they could just FaceTime me or Zoom me, whatever.

80
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,720
So the first two things is the time.

81
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,160
I prefer mornings.

82
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:32,320
Second thing is make sure they're at a desktop or a laptop somewhere quiet.

83
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,320
Third thing is day of the week.

84
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:40,200
One thing that I have noticed is I've had really, really good luck getting people to

85
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,160
jump on the phone with me on weekends.

86
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,080
And you think about your business.

87
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,240
Typically, your customers are bugging you because they just don't feel like they can

88
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,600
or maybe they're not working.

89
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,120
In weekends, you can work on your business, not just in your business.

90
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,600
And so I've had really good luck on weekends.

91
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:03,480
Outside of that, I haven't really noticed a difference as far as days of the week.

92
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:09,400
So Monday, I do know Monday tends to be a lot busier, so that's one day I try to, if

93
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,580
possible, avoid.

94
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:11,580
But you know what?

95
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,120
I also want to get my deals on Monday.

96
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:18,160
So I still like to do sales calls on Mondays, but it does seem that it's harder to get

97
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,120
people to schedule on Monday.

98
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,120
It's through the weekend.

99
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,120
Maybe they forget.

100
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,320
So I like to do, you know, Tuesday through Saturday.

101
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,480
Saturday would be my best option.

102
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,680
I personally don't do sales calls on Sunday.

103
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,680
That's up to you.

104
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,280
But I do know that on weekends, people are going to be working more on their business

105
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,360
than in their business.

106
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:39,040
So guys, once again, do your best to follow those best practices.

107
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,600
Also one, maybe one last thing I'll note is sometimes business owners, they think that

108
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,240
when you say zoom, it's going to be some crazy thing, especially these older older people

109
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,300
that aren't used to it.

110
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,300
Just let them know.

111
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,960
So hey, I'm going to send you an email with a zoom link.

112
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,960
And that's another thing.

113
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,880
Don't text them a link or they're going to jump on their phone.

114
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,760
Say I'm going to email you a link to zoom.

115
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,760
And here's what's cool.

116
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,200
Mr. Business owner, Mrs. Business owner.

117
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,760
All you have to do is click on the link and it will automatically pop up because some

118
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:08,000
of them get scared and they're like, I don't know how to zoom and I hate technology.

119
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,640
Just reassure them that this is not a big deal.

120
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,100
Guys, follow those exactly best that you can.

121
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,800
Also understanding that sometimes those don't always make sense and it's always better to

122
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,640
just go for it and try to make everything perfect and I'll see you on the next video.
