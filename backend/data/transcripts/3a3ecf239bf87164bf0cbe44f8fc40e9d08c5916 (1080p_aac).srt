1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,240
Alright guys, congratulations. At this point, you've gotten your first deal and if you're

2
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,800
watching this and you haven't, it's okay. Keep doing the process. Keep putting the reps

3
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,540
in and you will get a deal. But I want to cover what do you do after the deal, right?

4
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,760
You get the deal, the business owner gives you the credit card number, they give you

5
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,880
their information, all that stuff. What do you do then? What I like to do, the last couple

6
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,080
things that I like to do once they've given me the credit card before I end the call is

7
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,880
I let them know, hey, so here's what's going to happen. I'm actually, Mr. Business Owner,

8
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,320
I need first of all, what's the business address? Because I want to have the business address

9
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,960
for the contract. I want to know the legal business name. I'm going to write that down.

10
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,680
And I'm going to tell them, I'm going to be sending over two documents. I'm going to be

11
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:57,440
sending over an exclusivity agreement, which is how I phrase it, which basically will tell

12
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:02,960
you that this is 100% exclusive. It indicates the price. And by the way, and I'll say this,

13
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,000
by the way, most people, I know it's 2,000 bucks a month, most people just like to do

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,600
the 500 a week, so it's not as big of a deal. Do you want to do 500 a week? 2,000. Doesn't

15
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,200
matter to me, okay? Let's do the 500 a week. Cool. I like weekly, by the way, guys, because

16
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,800
I can monitor it more and you actually make a little bit more money over the course of

17
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,920
the year. So I prefer the weekly, but it's up to you. And I'll say, I'm going to have

18
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:28,480
two documents coming to, what's the best email? Let me grab that. I'll grab the email. Okay.

19
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:34,400
I'm going to send over the exclusivity agreement and I'm going to send over a credit card preauthorization.

20
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,440
All that's going to do is that's going to legally allow me to charge your card every

21
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:42,880
week so I don't have to bug you every single week. Okay. So all I need is those two signatures

22
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,120
and then who do you want the leads going to? Okay. Like what email, what address, et cetera?

23
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,880
I just grab it right there. So, okay, so it's going to go to you. Cool. What's the number?

24
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,880
Okay. Cool. And what's the email? Cool. So awesome. This sounds good. All I need you

25
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,680
to do, I'm going to get this going immediately. We'll have calls coming to you. Could be as

26
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,680
early as today. It may take a day or two depending on what comes in, but I'm going to get those

27
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,400
two documents. All I need is two signatures and we are ready to rock and roll. Awesome.

28
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:15,400
Thanks Brian. Thanks Jack. Thanks Tara. Thanks Tracy. Whatever. Boom. End the call. Okay.

29
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,340
Immediately. I don't go take a pee. I don't go get a drink. I don't treat myself to lunch.

30
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:23,740
I get the credit card signed. I get the deal run. So first thing I do is I run the card.

31
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:28,060
Okay. I set up the, I create the customer, set up the subscription, run the card, which

32
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:31,900
I'm going to show you how to do. Then I send over the contract and I send over the preauthorization

33
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,500
before I take a deep breath because this deal ain't done yet. Okay. You do have the card,

34
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:40,300
but the deal ain't done yet. So let's hop over to the screen. Okay guys. So first thing

35
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:45,860
that I do is I come over to Stripe. I'm not going to go through how to set up Stripe.

36
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:50,140
Google it, YouTube it. It's very simple. Go set up a Stripe account. If you have questions,

37
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:54,380
by the way, they've all been asked in the Facebook group, go and Google Stripe and you'll

38
00:02:54,380 --> 00:03:00,260
see people have had some very specific questions. You can go look at those. Okay. Not difficult.

39
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:05,260
I like Stripe. I know the fees are a little high or whatever. I don't care. I believe

40
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:09,780
money loves speed. I'll take that for the speed, the convenience and all that. I love

41
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,820
Stripe. Okay. So what you're going to do is once you come in, you're going to go over

42
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:20,820
to the customers tab. Okay. And you are going to add a customer and you're going to put

43
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:26,740
the customer in here. We'll just use this example. So we'll call it John Doe. Okay.

44
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:33,100
John Doe. I only fill out two things. I do the name and then the email. So John at Doe.com

45
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:38,580
add customer. Okay. That's step one. Step two is you need to come over and you need

46
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:45,500
a product. Okay. And what I do is I go and I push add product. Okay. And I'm going to

47
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:52,500
call this Queen Creek Concrete Leads. Okay. I leave the description blank or you can copy

48
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:56,180
the same thing down. It doesn't matter. And if you're going to do monthly, you're going

49
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:01,380
to put in 2000. If you're going to do weekly, you can put in 500, but do not forget to change

50
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:06,540
this to weekly. Okay. Because if you do, if you don't, you're going to be charging 500

51
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:10,460
a month and not realize it. Okay. So change it to weekly and just save it. Very simple.

52
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:14,260
So we've created the customer. We've created the product. Now you can just go back to your

53
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:20,380
customer list, click on John and go over where it says subscriptions and push create. You

54
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:24,660
can do it there or you can go to actions and push create subscription. Doesn't matter.

55
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:28,820
It's the same. And what's going to happen is you're going to search for first of all

56
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:33,080
the customers there, then you're going to search for the product, which usually pops

57
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:37,400
up first. Stripe smart enough to know you're probably going to be setting up that product,

58
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:42,280
that subscription, click on your product says 500 a week. And now here's what you're going

59
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:47,480
to do. Okay. You're going to go over and it's going to start on today's date and I'm going

60
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:51,800
to put it to go forever. I'm not going to have a stop on it because I don't want there

61
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:57,320
to be a stop and me losing money. I would rather the customer hit me up and say, Hey,

62
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,320
you overcharge me and me refund it. And I lose a couple of bucks then to not get paid.

63
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,840
So I leave it as forever because I plan on working with these guys forever. Just so you

64
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:09,840
know, six months is just the beginning. Okay. You don't have to mess with any of this stuff,

65
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,640
blah, blah, blah. Okay. And then what you're going to do because you already have the credit

66
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:17,040
card number is you're going to go over and hit automatically charge a credit payment

67
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,800
method on file, push add a payment. And guess what? You put in the credit card number, you

68
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:26,360
put in the month and the year and you put in the CVC and you push add. Okay. And once

69
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,560
you do that, I'm not, I don't have a credit card here. You're going to push start subscription.

70
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:36,720
And that is immediately going to charge the customer immediately. Okay. And you're done.

71
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,600
That is like, the crazy part is you are done with Stripe. It will continue to build them

72
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,280
every single month forever or week. And you were done. That's how simple it is. This is

73
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:51,360
why I love Stripe. That took me 30 seconds. Okay. That's it. That's it. And this is what

74
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,760
I love about this too. I like to run the payment first before I worry about the contract because

75
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,960
that card, it'll say insufficient funds. And now you're like, okay, this guy, this gate,

76
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,960
this lady, she's yanking me around or this guy, this lady, they don't have money. Okay.

77
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,320
Or they gave me the wrong card or they're messing with me or whatever, but you're going

78
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:14,600
to know right there. So payments done. Okay. And it's set up. Then I'm going to go over

79
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,640
and this is going to be, it's going to be included as a download. It's also in the file

80
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:24,720
section of Stripe. You're going to fill out the lead generation and exclusivity agreement.

81
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,680
Now, the only thing you're going to need to change on this because this is just a template

82
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:33,920
is you need to go and change your information and just do it once and have it saved. Okay.

83
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,720
So that's your company and all that, all that good stuff. And you're going to need to change

84
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:44,360
down here in the governing law. You need to change this to your state and your county.

85
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:49,280
So it should not say Washington County and it should not say Utah. Okay. That is it.

86
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,320
And if you want to make sure you can search Utah, but those are the only two places is

87
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:58,200
those two spots, change those, change your information. And then what you're going to

88
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:02,880
do is you're going to drop in your customer's information. Okay. So I'll typically go file,

89
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:09,600
make a copy so I can save my template. And then I'm going to put John, sorry, client

90
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:22,600
is John's Concrete. Okay. Name of the company as I put, or sorry, name is John Doe address,

91
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:30,760
blah, blah, blah, whatever, email john at doe.com. Okay. And only other thing I add

92
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:39,120
here is I will put location is Queen Creek AZ industry is, and if you want, you can just

93
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,640
do flatwork concrete if you want to, if you guys just agreed to flatwork and not decorative

94
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:49,880
and change the term. So six months, whatever, put that in there. And then the monthly fee

95
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:54,920
or you can change it to say weekly fee. So in this case, I'm going to put weekly fee

96
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:59,280
is going to be 500 a month or 500 a week. And that's it. And then what you're going

97
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:06,840
to do is you're going to go file, download as a PDF. Okay. That's it. You're going to

98
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:11,280
come over and I like to use doc hub. Okay. The reason I like to use doc hub is because

99
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:16,920
you get five free signatures. It's very simple. But you can use doc. You sign. It doesn't

100
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,880
matter what you use. I've always used doc hub for my lead generation clients. Okay.

101
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:25,400
You're going to come over here and you're going to sign up for the free. I'm going to

102
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:31,360
sign in really quick with my account. So give me one moment. All right guys, here we are

103
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,560
in doc hub. Very simple. You're just going to go new document. Okay. You're going to

104
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:41,960
upload it and you're going to go to your downloads and you're going to find that download

105
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,520
that you had. Okay. And you're going to want to name it something else than this. So I'll

106
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:52,960
change it to put, you know, whatever I'll put queen up, shoot, sorry. Okay. I'll usually

107
00:08:52,960 --> 00:09:00,720
name it like this. Queen Creek concrete. And then I'll put, um, like John's concrete dash

108
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,440
flat fee lead generation agreement, blah, blah, blah. I want this to be very, I'm thinking,

109
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,280
okay, what happens if this client does a back charge or tries to refund? I want this to

110
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:16,080
show like, I want striped look at this and go, okay, this guy could have never been confused.

111
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,800
The document is called lead generation agreement. So he can't claim he didn't know. Okay. So

112
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,640
just, just overkill, but I like to name it something there. It's also easily searchable.

113
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,400
And then you're going to go and do a couple of easy things. Okay. You're going to hit

114
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:34,800
this a tool and you're going to go drop in the date. So today's date is 23 June. Okay.

115
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:45,040
Make it look good. Don't just slop it in there. Okay. And then again, June 23rd and 23 June,

116
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:54,720
which clearly I'm being sloppy here. Boom. Okay. 23rd June. Okay. And that is all you

117
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,560
need in terms of what you need to fill out. And then what you need to do is you need to go

118
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,040
push sign. You're going to need to create your signature the first time. But then once you have

119
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,280
it, you can just come in here, drop your signature. And by the way, just for those of you that missed

120
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:11,040
that, just click sign and it's going to, you're going to grab your signature and draw it down.

121
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,880
Okay. So I signed and then you're going to go to this little thing right here. It says manage

122
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,360
fields. You're going to click on it and you're going to go to the signature one and you're going

123
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,560
to drop it right here. Okay. And you're going to go over to the assignee and you're going to put

124
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:32,800
john at doe.com and you're going to add. Okay. If you can see his initials, J O, which I don't

125
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:38,240
know why it says J O, but it should say J D or I don't know, but it says J O whatever,

126
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,400
but it says right here, he's assigned. So this says if that would be not assigned,

127
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:47,200
I'm going to assign in that field and you are done. All you need to do is push prepare sign

128
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:53,520
request. And when I push send request, this is going to send him to the email that you put on

129
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:58,640
file right here. It's going to send him the document that he or she can open up and with

130
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:03,360
their finger or from their computer sign, and it will send you a copy and you are done with

131
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,560
the contract. That's it. Okay. Very, very simple. You're done. Then what I do is I hop over to the

132
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,800
credit card authorization. So I go to new documents. I already have this thing saved as an

133
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,120
authorization. I'll search for it. I don't know if I have it downloaded, so I might need to do that

134
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:22,960
really quick. I do not. So let me go over to this. And by the way, this is in the file section. Let

135
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:29,840
me download this on this computer really quick. Boom. Go back over to doc hub upload and let's

136
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:37,200
look under my downloads. Credit card authorization is hiding right there. Beautiful. And same thing,

137
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,160
you're just going to fill this out. So again, I'll probably put their company name. I'll put

138
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:47,280
John's concrete credit card authorization. Okay. I'm going to put the, I'm going to use the a tool

139
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:56,320
and I'm going to go card holder's name. John's or sorry, John dough. I'm going to make it look

140
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:03,600
nice. I'm going to put the card number, uh, four, four, four, four, four, four, four, four, four,

141
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:09,920

142
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:16,320
seven of 26, make it look nice. And then I don't know why this one doesn't include it. We need to

143
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,040
just fix the template, but I always add the CBC here just so I don't honestly, so I don't forget

144
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,960
it. Cause I'm going to throw that piece of paper away. So let's say it's six, four, two. Okay.

145
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,840
Billing address eight, four, sorry, eight, four, seven. I know that's mine. We're just using an

146
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:40,240
example. And then you're going to fill us out for them. So I John dough. Boom. Authorize whatever

147
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:48,160
my company is called. This is my lead gen company called EMM ventures, LLC to charge my credit card,

148
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:56,640
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And then you're going to put the date in June 23rd, 2022. Done.

149
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:02,080
And you're going to go and one more time to this field right here, grab that signature box, put it

150
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:10,960
in here. And you're going to add John at dough.com, push add and assign it to him. You push prepare

151
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:17,760
sign request. You send the request and guys, you are done. You have the credit card charged. You

152
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:25,280

153
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:30,000

154
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,080

155
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:41,120
and you are done. And that my friends is what you call a big boy, big girl deal. That is start to

156
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:46,720
finish exactly how you do it. That's all I do. So after the call, I do all those things. We're done.

157
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,040
All the formalities are done. And then I'm immediately going to go and make sure that I

158
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:57,360
go to Colorado, send him the leads directly. I'm going to go into my Weebly forms or WordPress.

159
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,800
I'm going to make sure he's getting the, uh, the quote forms instant, uh, the, what they call them

160
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:11,200
web submissions, whatever. And we are done. So guys, here's the game. You do this over and over

161
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:16,320
and over. If you can do it one time, if you can make a thousand dollars one time, you can literally

162
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,480
repeat that a hundred times to get to a hundred thousand dollars per month. That's exactly what I

163
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,600
did. Go and do it as many times as you can and go and hit those goals.
