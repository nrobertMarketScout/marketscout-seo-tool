00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,040
Guys, really quick as we wrap up this module on content, I want to talk about outsourcing

2
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,040
really quick.

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,360
And a lot of you guys, I know it's like, oh my gosh, content, it's the worst, it sucks.

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,240
Back to what I said.

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:21,280
This is one of those areas, if we can get good at it, if we can master it, this is going

6
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,080
to give us that edge over the competition.

7
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:28,780
So again, change your mindset from this is a burden to how do I master it, how do I get

8
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:29,780
good at it.

9
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:33,500
And that segues perfectly into when should you outsource your content.

10
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:38,140
It's the same answer as when you should outsource anything after you master it.

11
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:42,220
If you do not know how to write content yourself, how are you going to outsource it?

12
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:46,620
How are you going to know that the person that you gave it to wrote good content?

13
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,500
How are you going to know that they didn't plagiarize it?

14
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,620
How are you going to know that it's decent content?

15
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:53,140
You're not unless you personally know how to write it and you're not going to be able

16
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,140
to know how to train on it.

17
00:00:54,740 --> 00:01:00,740
Number one, don't start or try to outsource something until you first have mastered it.

18
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:04,860
We are going to be coming out with some resources if you decide that you want to start outsourcing

19
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:11,220
content in the future, but for now go master it and let's go rank these websites.
