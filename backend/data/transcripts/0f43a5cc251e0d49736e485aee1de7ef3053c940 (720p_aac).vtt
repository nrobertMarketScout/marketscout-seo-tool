00:00.000 --> 00:04.080
I learned this back doing door-to-door sales, okay?

00:04.080 --> 00:06.300
So for example, back doing door-to-door sales,

00:06.300 --> 00:09.140
we were always taught that you do business,

00:09.140 --> 00:12.120
people do business at the kitchen table, okay?

00:12.120 --> 00:15.400
And that was, your chances of closing a deal

00:15.400 --> 00:17.280
at the kitchen table were far better

00:17.280 --> 00:22.280
than sitting at the couch with Jack, the retired Marine,

00:22.640 --> 00:24.680
sitting at the couch while he's watching TV,

00:24.680 --> 00:26.880
way better at the kitchen table because he's focused,

00:26.880 --> 00:28.440
he's watching you, he's paying attention,

00:28.440 --> 00:29.820
and we're doing business, okay?

00:29.900 --> 00:32.060
So the equivalent of that, and this is the first thing

00:32.060 --> 00:34.100
that I would say is a best practice,

00:34.100 --> 00:35.740
I want you guys to write down,

00:35.740 --> 00:39.660
is get them on a desktop or a laptop,

00:39.660 --> 00:42.260
none of this phone bullshit, okay?

00:42.260 --> 00:44.260
Here's why, if they're on their phone,

00:44.260 --> 00:46.420
that gives them the ability to be in their truck,

00:46.420 --> 00:49.300
that gives them the ability to be at the store,

00:49.300 --> 00:51.660
that gives them the ability, who was I on the phone with?

00:51.660 --> 00:55.000
I did a close with somebody, or maybe it was just me,

00:55.000 --> 00:55.980
I can't remember who it was.

00:55.980 --> 00:59.460
Oh, guys, she's not in this group, Preeti,

00:59.460 --> 01:02.540
if you guys watch, I was on her close

01:02.540 --> 01:05.180
when she closed the deal a couple months ago,

01:05.180 --> 01:07.640
like three, four months ago, right?

01:07.640 --> 01:10.940
And we didn't do this, well, she set the whole thing up,

01:10.940 --> 01:14.940
I just hopped on, the guy was on his phone driving,

01:14.940 --> 01:18.940
and he was buying dog food, like, we still got the deal,

01:18.940 --> 01:21.180
we still got the deal, but he was buying dog food,

01:21.180 --> 01:22.900
I was so pissed off, I'm like, bro,

01:22.900 --> 01:24.300
we are literally talking right here,

01:24.300 --> 01:29.300
and you're buying dog food, so make sure they're at a desktop,

01:29.300 --> 01:31.840
make sure they're at a laptop, and if you do that,

01:31.840 --> 01:33.580
they're not gonna be able to be driving around,

01:33.580 --> 01:34.860
or doing this, or doing that,

01:34.860 --> 01:36.380
or jotting down notes, or whatever,

01:36.380 --> 01:37.280
make sure they're at a desktop.

01:37.280 --> 01:39.980
Now, how do you do that without making it sound weird?

01:39.980 --> 01:42.140
This is what I would recommend, I would say, hey,

01:42.140 --> 01:45.700
if possible, please be at a laptop or a desktop,

01:45.700 --> 01:48.320
because I wanna show you a couple things,

01:48.320 --> 01:50.820
it's going to be really hard for you

01:50.820 --> 01:53.600
to see on your tiny little screen.

01:53.600 --> 01:54.740
That's how you're gonna do it, okay?

01:54.740 --> 01:57.480
So the equivalent of sitting at the kitchen table,

01:57.520 --> 02:00.240
in door-to-door sales, which me and Lincoln are familiar with,

02:00.240 --> 02:02.600
and I know Marcus has done door-to-door sales as well,

02:02.600 --> 02:07.100
is being at a desktop, being at a laptop, not on the phone.

02:08.480 --> 02:11.200
Not on something that they can move around with, okay?

02:11.200 --> 02:14.120
Something they gotta sit their ass down and pay attention.

02:14.120 --> 02:15.360
What that's going to allow you to do,

02:15.360 --> 02:17.320
it's going to allow you to get their attention,

02:17.320 --> 02:18.880
and they're gonna move everything else,

02:18.880 --> 02:20.300
and they're just gonna be focusing on you, okay?

02:20.300 --> 02:21.880
It's gonna be really hard for them to get up,

02:21.880 --> 02:22.720
and go get a drink,

02:22.720 --> 02:24.360
because they're gonna have to carry their damn computer,

02:24.360 --> 02:26.600
and if they're at a desktop, they can't, okay?

02:26.600 --> 02:28.760
So make sure they're at a desktop, if at all possible,

02:28.760 --> 02:32.120
and do it by saying, hey, I wanna show you a thing or two.

02:32.120 --> 02:35.000
If you can be on a desktop or a laptop,

02:35.000 --> 02:37.080
that's gonna make it way easier so you can see the screen.

02:37.080 --> 02:38.800
It's gonna be really hard to see on your phone,

02:38.800 --> 02:40.000
which is true, by the way.
