00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,880
Kareem says, is it a bad idea to mention the contract on the video call before

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:08,160
the call? I typically don't because I don't want to like over make this a big

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,780
deal guys. Sales, as soon as people feel about buying pressure, then all of a

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,460
sudden they want to throw their hands up and they don't want, you know, they

5
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:18,260
want to do it. And so sometimes what happens is we start bringing stuff up

6
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,880
too quick. We start dropping price, we start dropping contract, we start

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,620
dropping this and that and the rest on our first call and we lose the deal.

8
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:32,780
I, sorry. Go ahead. I also, I never call it a contract. I say after he already

9
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:37,980
said he agrees, I say, okay, I'm going to send you this exclusivity agreement so

10
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,820
you know that I'm only working with you and it's going to stay that on there.

11
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:48,220
Like take it a lot, make it sound a lot more easy. Then I don't, I never say hey,

12
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:53,020
sign this contract for six months because that usually scares them. Yeah.

13
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,940
But if you do, it's all about how you say it, right? If you want to, sometimes

14
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,140
I'll say it. I don't care because I'm going to look and go, yeah, there's just

15
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:04,420
like, is there a contract? Yeah, of course. Obviously, like imagine, imagine

16
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:08,580
I'm committing to you exclusively. I'm not going to go look for any other

17
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,660
business owners, but you can just cancel anytime. That sounds like a one sided

18
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:14,340
marriage. That doesn't sound like it's going to work. Obviously, you need to

19
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,860
commit to me for six months. How are we going to judge this off one month? Like

20
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,020
I make it so obvious. Like, of course there's a contract, bro. Did you buy

21
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,340
your cell phone out right? No, of course you didn't. Did you buy your car right?

22
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:28,460
No, probably not. Just how it is. We do six month agreement, you know? So it

23
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:32,220
depends. Now you can phrase it whatever. It doesn't matter. And I like what you

24
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:36,020
say as well, Francesca, but you, if you're going to say it, be confident.

25
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:40,020
Yeah, of course. Of course there's a contract, bro. I mean, it's a one month

26
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:44,220
deal and you just freaking get a pick and choose and then go have tea and

27
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,420
crumpets. Come on, bro. You know?
