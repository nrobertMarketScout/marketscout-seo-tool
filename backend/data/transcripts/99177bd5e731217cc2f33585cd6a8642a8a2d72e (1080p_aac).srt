1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
you're going to go for the close, okay?

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:06,020
My tip on that, do it on Zoom and do it in the morning

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:09,980
before they go to work, before the day starts.

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:12,980
And honestly, I've had some of my best success

5
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,900
doing deals on Saturday morning.

6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,340
Sounds crazy, sounds weird, but guess what?

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:18,480
A lot of times during the week,

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,380
these guys are fricking running their business.

9
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,820
They're not working on their business.

10
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:23,420
They're working in their business.

11
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:26,340
So I used to schedule calls when I was actively doing them.

12
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,500
Now we have people in closers,

13
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,480
but when I was actively in 2020, on Saturday morning,

14
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,320
you know what I would do?

15
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,600
And in 2021, Saturday morning,

16
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,520
I would schedule a sales call for 7 a.m.

17
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,940
That's how I wanted to start my weekend.

18
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,960
I wanted to make dough by 8.30.

19
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,100
I had a new credit card on file and boom,

20
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,480
I could enjoy the weekend.

21
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,880
I would close, I had very, very high percentage

22
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,840
of closing on Saturday morning.

23
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,760
So my tip is do it in the morning while they're still fresh

24
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,380
before all the problems have,

25
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:56,340
they become inundated with problems.

26
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:01,360
And as a bonus, Saturdays seem to work very, very well.
