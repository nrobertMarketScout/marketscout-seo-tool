1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:23,680
All right, we are live.

2
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,680
Let's see.

3
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,880
I think just want to make sure I can hear myself.

4
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:46,800
All right, I don't think we have anyone on yet, but we're going to keep rolling along.

5
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,720
All right, looks like we just got a couple of people that hopped on.

6
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,680
Just so you know, Nick is going to be on in just a few minutes.

7
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,000
He's on his way to the office.

8
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,080
Don't worry, you're not stuck with me for the next hour.

9
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,040
Can you guys let me know if you can hear me?

10
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,920
I'm trying to get Facebook on my phone, but should be able to hear me.

11
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:12,560
Let's see.

12
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,520
All right, so see we got a couple people on.

13
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,240
Can you guys hear me?

14
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,560
Make sure I can't hear myself.

15
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,320
Nick's going to be on in just a few minutes.

16
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,720
He is on his way to the office.

17
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,560
So just hang tight real quick.

18
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,040
Thank you, Aaron Smith.

19
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,960
Appreciate that, bro.

20
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,920
Coming in loud and clear.

21
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,520
All right.

22
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,240
And dude, Aaron, I think, aren't you, didn't you just join?

23
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,680
I think I saw your post on digital landlords.

24
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,720
That's awesome, bro.

25
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,240
I'm super excited to have you.

26
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,560
How this normally works is Nick will just go live here at 7 a.m. MST.

27
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,280
But again, he just asked me real quick to jump in

28
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,720
because he's going to be a few minutes late on the way to the office.

29
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,200
But we're going to get this thing rolling.

30
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,320
It's going to be a fun topic.

31
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,960
It's going to be talking about second money.

32
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,760
And what's cool about that is some people might be like, well, I got a first.

33
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,920
Let's see, Stephanie says there's no link.

34
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,880
Stephanie, are you talking about our group message with like Kyle and fix it?

35
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,320
Or I'm not sure what you mean by there's no link.

36
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,560
I did message you, by the way, in our group chat.

37
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,600
But Matthew says, I hear you, Aaron.

38
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,400
Nice to be here.

39
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,360
Yes.

40
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,000
Thank you, Matthew.

41
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,800
Nice to be here as well.

42
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,200
I just sent Nick the zoom link, so we're going to get this thing rolling.

43
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,040
And again, we're going to be talking about second money.

44
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,680
And what's cool about second money is that even if you're still working on that first deal,

45
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,240
anytime you're learning about sales or just like business principles

46
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,000
or just pricing structure in general,

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,120
it seems like can be so applicable to just every aspect of whatever stage you're in in business.

48
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,840
So I'm looking forward to talking about it.

49
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,240
And so we're getting a few more people on.

50
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,000
Just as a quick recap, guys, Nick's going to be on in a few minutes.

51
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,480
So hang tight with me real quick.

52
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,360
And we're going to get this thing rolling.

53
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,360
Let me check my messages from him.

54
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:15,680
Awesome.

55
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,160
He says he's going to be there in a few minutes.

56
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:24,080
So while we're waiting, I don't want to have dead air.

57
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,880
I can do a quick little story of the Daniel says good morning.

58
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,000
Good morning, Daniel.

59
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,280
Good to see you, brother.

60
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,120
So again, we're just waiting for Nick right now.

61
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,000
He's going to be on soon.

62
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,080
But so as of right now, I don't have any active deals.

63
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,000
That's like 100% on me.

64
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,680
Like I've closed deals in the past.

65
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,000
I've done a complete A to Z on my own.

66
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And then with winter, because it was in Michigan,

67
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,800
and we had to put a pause on it.

68
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,200
Anyway, that said, I've had deals.

69
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:57,120
And looking back on it, it's so important to qualify your business owners

70
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,720
because you can waste a lot of time.

71
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,360
Oh, Stephanie says, I thought this was a Zoom, but I hear you.

72
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,960
Yeah, I know this is just going to be the live.

73
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,760
I mean, if Nick has time, I know we've done this in the past,

74
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,120
but I'm like bring people on for Q&A, like onto the Zoom.

75
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,560
So we can actually see.

76
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,960
We'll probably be a little short on time today.

77
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,800
We can even see about starting to do that at the end of each live call each week.

78
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,520
Anyway, so what happened was when you're calling these business owners,

79
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,040
I would usually come from the perspective or the mindset.

80
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,480
I'm inconveniencing them.

81
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,240
I'm asking them, please take my leads.

82
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,800
And that's just the wrong way to approach it

83
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,600
because we're the one who's actually delivering the value.

84
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,480
And so this was like a year ago when I was still pretty insecure

85
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,840
about all this stuff didn't like sales, that much didn't know what I was doing.

86
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,480
I mean, I knew what I was doing, but just didn't have much experience.

87
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,160
So I called this guy.

88
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,920
It's his Hispanic dude, right?

89
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,400
And he was like, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

90
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,240
He was super excited as he should be.

91
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,040
It's free leads.

92
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,920
And so I don't ask him any questions though,

93
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,320
because I'm afraid to lose the deal.

94
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,000
I mean, looking back on it, it's absolutely ridiculous, right?

95
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,120
You should be asking like, hey, man, I'm happy to give you a couple of free leads,

96
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,760
but just to make sure I don't want to waste your time or my time.

97
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,800
Can I ask a couple of quick questions just to make sure this is going to be a good fit, right?

98
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,920
And so again, that's when it talks about the pullback, right?

99
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,160
And so I'm just reliving this in my mind.

100
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,520
Bottom line is I send this guy a couple of leads.

101
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,120
We go to hop on the Zoom call.

102
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,360
And by the way, for the few of you that just jumped on,

103
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,560
Nick's going to be on in a few minutes.

104
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,080
He's on his way to the office.

105
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,640
Anyway, I've sent this guy a few concrete leads at this point, right?

106
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,360
They're good leads.

107
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,400
I've live transferred them.

108
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,960
He goes, we have a Zoom call scheduled.

109
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,880
I start the Zoom.

110
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm excited.

111
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,440
I'm ready to do this thing.

112
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,560
He doesn't show.

113
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,360
I text him.

114
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,320
I don't hear anything back.

115
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,040
Few hours later, this was scheduled for the morning.

116
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,800
He texts, sorry, bro.

117
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,720
I was late at a party last night with my brother and I slept in.

118
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,800
So that's a bit of a red flag, right?

119
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,120
Anyway, like, okay, whatever.

120
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,440
And I didn't like do anything to like do a pullback or whatever.

121
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,520
I was just like totally getting walked all over.

122
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,600
And I was like, okay, well, we can do it tomorrow or whatever when we schedule it.

123
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,120
So we go to schedule it.

124
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,560
And I had prefaced this when we, the day before, said, by the way, bro,

125
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,680
if you could be at your desktop or laptop, that'd be great.

126
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,360
In case I need to share my screen, it'll just help the call to go by faster, right?

127
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,840
So he's like, oh yeah, that sounds great.

128
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,440
So we have the scheduled Zoom call.

129
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:28,240
The dude shows up on his phone at the park with his like younger girl, right?

130
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,680
Let's see, I'm just checking the message from Nick.

131
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,480
He's going to be on soon.

132
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:37,840
So right then and there, I should have been like, dude, I should have done a pullback.

133
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,320
And like, it doesn't look like you're like actually serious or whatever.

134
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,040
We're here to do business or whatever, something, right?

135
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,560
Because he just did exactly the opposite of what I asked him to do, right?

136
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,240
Plus I need to share my screen, like that's a real thing.

137
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,320
And so he goes, it's like, yeah, man, sorry, like just here.

138
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,120
It's like, okay, whatever.

139
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,880
So I just do the call, right?

140
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,920
And I have no control of the sales process.

141
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,680
He's just stringing me along the whole time, right?

142
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,440
Go to find out.

143
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,320
This is where prospecting qualifying comes in.

144
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,400
The guy is, it was actually, it was crazy.

145
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,760
I go to hop on, turns out he, he doesn't have a green card.

146
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,040
So he's an illegal alien.

147
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,920
And like, I was like 16 at this point.

148
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:21,040
And so it was actually kind of funny because I was kind of like freaking out internally,

149
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,800
like, oh my goodness, am I going to get in trouble for doing business with like whatever?

150
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,400
Like, you know what I'm saying, right?

151
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,800
And so bottom line is I just kind of looked past that still see if we can make something work.

152
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,200
So I go to drop price and what do you know?

153
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,440
Boom, he's out.

154
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,360
I was going to charge like a thousand bucks a month.

155
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,600
And we were getting like, if I remember, it was like at least 12 to 15 leads a month.

156
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,840
What a nightmare.

157
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,320
If I was one year younger, I probably would have started crying.

158
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,320
And yes, Eman, that is the proper emoji for that.

159
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,920
So the moral of the story is to qualify these people, right?

160
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,360
Now there is a little trick.

161
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,360
Like if you ask too many questions on the cold call, it does seem like you will lose them.

162
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,720
But what I found to be helpful is that when you hop on the cold call,

163
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,680
depending on where they're at, it can be helpful to send them one lead to just like,

164
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,640
so you show you're legit and then they're interested in that and be like,

165
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,720
hey man, I'm happy to send you a few more.

166
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,040
But hey, let's hop on a quick like chat today or tomorrow or whatever.

167
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,720
And just so we can learn more about each other, right?

168
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,080
In case we just want to see if this is a good fit, right?

169
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,080
So then you're giving them permission to learn more about you.

170
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,120
That way they're not scared of like, who is this guy and have zero dollars.

171
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,120
Like we can be transparent with them, right?

172
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,640
And then vice versa, right?

173
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,480
So, oh, Eman says, just call me E homie.

174
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,800
Thanks, bro.

175
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,000
Appreciate it, Eve.

176
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,520
Um, yeah, dude.

177
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,400
Um, anyway, so let's see.

178
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,560
Like it's a few minutes late, but anyway, that's it guys.

179
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,000
Qualify these people.

180
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,760
We're the ones who bringing, like we are looking for a win-win partnership, right?

181
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,520
But we're the ones who are bringing the value to the table, right?

182
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,200
And so it's really important not to get walked over by these business owners.

183
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,280
I've lost a lot of deals from that.

184
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,560
It's taken me a lot than that.

185
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:06,880
Yeah.

186
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,040
Anyway, so prospecting is a really big one.

187
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,840
And I guess the biggest thing is like, just don't be scared to lose the deal.

188
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,040
Number one, you probably won't.

189
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,600
Number two, if you do, they probably aren't a good fit anyway.

190
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,000
As long as obviously you don't be like super like interrogation style with it.

191
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,920
But Jason, good morning.

192
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,960
Glad to have you here, bro.

193
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,240
Let's see.

194
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,720
Nick should be on moment Tito.

195
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,440
Sorry about this guys.

196
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,640
Oh, thanks, Mahmood.

197
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,360
Yeah, man.

198
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,840
Um, hope that call goes well, bro.

199
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,680
If you put in reps, I know you're crushing it.

200
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,080
That's really cool to see all the lives you're doing in the group.

201
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,840
So, yeah, that was probably like the worst sales experience.

202
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,880
Um, yeah, that was pretty crazy.

203
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,840
Um, all right.

204
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:58,560
So, okay, well, may as well.

205
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,680
May as well relive another sales story.

206
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,560
And what's really cool about this though, guys, is when we look at the sales process,

207
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,040
obviously when, when dealing with people, there's always variables, right?

208
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,960
Just with responses and this or that or triggers or whatever.

209
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,760
Right.

210
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,120
But there is like when Jordan, love him or hate him.

211
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,880
When Jordan Belfort says like every sale is the same, there is a truth to that.

212
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,040
Right.

213
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,440
Like when we look at the sales process that we have, it is a straight line.

214
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:25,680
Right.

215
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,160
And so all we gotta do is like check these boxes.

216
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,400
And it is really like, think talks about in the modules, baking the cake.

217
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,960
When we add these ingredients, 99% of the time, we should get a cake out the other side.

218
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,360
Right.

219
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,760
And so what's really cool about that is usually in sales, it can feel super overwhelming.

220
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,480
But for us, all we gotta do is just make enough cold calls to get someone on the hook.

221
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,280
Right.

222
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:52,160
All we gotta do is just live transfer enough leads to get them ready for the zoom call.

223
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,080
And then all we gotta do is the zoom call.

224
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,080
It really is like a three-step sales process.

225
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:56,320
Right.

226
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,040
It is the prospecting, the setup, and the close.

227
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:04,400
And so what's so cool about that is some of us are better than others at different parts.

228
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,680
Like I was really bad at all three.

229
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,280
I've gotten a little better at the closing.

230
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,520
But I still need to get better at the prospecting and the setup.

231
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:11,760
Right.

232
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,120
And qualifying these business owners and just not getting so nervous and all that.

233
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:15,680
Right.

234
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,640
But what's so cool about that is once we check off all the boxes, that's when it does become

235
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,520
a machine.

236
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,000
Right.

237
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,360
And that's when we can put in the certain inputs to get the outputs.

238
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,440
And that's when we can predictably grow our business.

239
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:27,920
Right.

240
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,520
So that's the state I'm in right now.

241
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:33,440
And by the way, for the few of you that just hopped on, Nick's gonna be on any minute.

242
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,400
Hang tight.

243
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,840
I have texted him the zoom link.

244
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,760
He's gonna be on soon.

245
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,320
So anyway, it's funny.

246
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,800
Like a lot of the, it seems like with this group, the main issues isn't, most people

247
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,400
struggle with the sales in this business.

248
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,040
Right.

249
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,000
Like so many people know how to rank a website or get leads.

250
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,440
But a lot of people just struggle with converting that to specifically flat fee deals.

251
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,880
Because that's really where you scale.

252
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,160
I mean, you can make money with commission and pay per lead, but there's just so much

253
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,200
maintenance per client.

254
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,600
It's really not, it's really difficult to scale that way.

255
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,200
But I was going to say the biggest issues, it seems like even me personally is just on

256
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,800
the tech side with getting Google ad set, getting the due diligence, which is actually

257
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,040
kind of cool to some degree, because once we get those things dialed in, then for our

258
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:18,320
personal agencies, it is just so much easier to scale because we have just the sales process

259
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,040
works.

260
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:19,600
Right.

261
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,480
And so I'm excited to be getting back into things.

262
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,360
I actually got another lead yesterday for my ad campaign.

263
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,360
So I need to be live transferring that over.

264
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,000
And so yeah, guys, it's a good business.

265
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,720
Like I was actually on a zoom with Jason Oliver the other day.

266
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,880
And it seems like a helpful perspective when looking at this is to look at it as somewhat

267
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,080
of a game, right?

268
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,960
Not that we want to be cavalier, irresponsible about it.

269
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:45,520
But when we look at it as a game, it seems like, for me at least, it helps me to kind

270
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:50,720
of like lower the emotional, like tension or anxiety or whatever, and just like look

271
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,760
at this as a game again.

272
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,560
Moving pieces like, OK, I got to check these six boxes.

273
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,400
What's the one thing that's holding me up?

274
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,960
OK, I need the ads are holding me up or whatever.

275
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,280
Or like, OK, I just can't get someone on the hook.

276
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:01,600
Right.

277
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,240
And so whatever it is, that is the dragon to slay at that moment.

278
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:06,960
Right.

279
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:10,320
And so Nick just said he's getting on now.

280
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,200
So anyway, guys, I'm just excited to be getting back with things.

281
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,640
And I mean, if it takes me a year to land a couple deals, the amount of progress you

282
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:22,960
can make in a three month period in this business once the processes are dialed in

283
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,560
makes it so worth it.

284
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,400
And so just because it's going slow now or for me like, man, a couple of months.

285
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,640
And to be fair, I really haven't been taking the action I should.

286
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,760
So that's on my end.

287
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:37,200
But again, just like looking at long picture, like a six month sprint, you guys have no

288
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:37,840
idea.

289
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:42,400
Like the people that are making like 10k plus a month in this business, a lot of them

290
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:46,560
got there really fast once they kind of got through the weeds or got through the mud

291
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,640
of the first couple of months or whatever.

292
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,400
Like I know that's what happened with Jason.

293
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:56,240
And I mean, obviously, we've all seen Ryan Dalton and his insane scaling in just a few

294
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,600
short year or two.

295
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,360
So Nick is stopping on now.

296
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:03,760
All right.

297
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,640
Aaron, can you hear me?

298
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,520
I can hear you.

299
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:08,720
Let's see.

300
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,680
Can you hear me?

301
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:09,920
Yeah.

302
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,520
Let me try the mic.

303
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:11,920
Hold on.

304
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:13,760
How about now?

305
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,360
I can hear you.

306
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:15,920
Yeah, you're good.

307
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,600
Everyone, can you hear Nick?

308
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,120
You should be able to.

309
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,520
Let me know as soon as you can hear me.

310
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,640
I'm gonna pull up my notes.

311
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,880
Yeah, yesterday, my mic wasn't working.

312
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,800
I don't know what's going on, but good to hear.

313
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,160
Yeah.

314
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:30,480
Awesome.

315
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,280
They say that they can hear you loud and clear, which is great.

316
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,280
Let me see if I get my camera.

317
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,400
Let me check on Facebook.

318
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,320
I'm not seeing your screen on my screen.

319
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,280
It might just be the.

320
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,400
Oh, no, hold on.

321
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:42,800
There we go.

322
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,920
Can you see me now?

323
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,160
Yeah.

324
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,800
Oh, okay.

325
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,040
So not to cut anyone off.

326
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:49,840
Are you recording?

327
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,440
Not yet.

328
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,000
Here we go.

329
00:14:59,280 --> 00:14:59,760
Amazing.

330
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,640
Thanks for starting this call, Aaron.

331
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,760
Welcome to the call, guys.

332
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,040
Aaron, did I cut you off in the middle of something?

333
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,480
No, you're good, bro.

334
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,240
Just reliving some sales deals and all that.

335
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,680
Beautiful.

336
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,480
Okay.

337
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,280
Well, that said, guys, welcome to the call.

338
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:22,960
If this is your first call, then just know we're going to be doing this forever.

339
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,760
You're going to see this call at this time forever.

340
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,960
I know it's a tiny bit early for some,

341
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,240
but it's the best possible time we can do to get as many people as possible.

342
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,960
So, Aaron, are you going to be able to stay on for this call?

343
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:37,920
Yeah.

344
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,120
Okay.

345
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,440
So real quick, before we get started, did you talk about the podcast?

346
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,360
Not yet.

347
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,720
I'm just going to leave that to you.

348
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,200
All right.

349
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:55,680
So, guys, we decided that it would be beneficial for...

350
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:00,080
I would say it's a bit selfish as well,

351
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:05,120
but we decided that it would be a good idea to do not the classic,

352
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:13,200
let me interview the random people in my town who are nobodies

353
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:17,920
and let me have interviews with people that are not interesting.

354
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,120
That's really bad.

355
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,880
I hate those.

356
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:30,240
We decided that there's so many nuanced things to this business model

357
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:37,440
that it would be a good idea to just have an entire podcast,

358
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:43,280
entire series, an entire show dedicated towards every single nuance

359
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,520
and every single facet of this business.

360
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:52,080
So we have launched the Digital Real Estate Secrets podcast.

361
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:55,920
It's just basically 100% all things this business model.

362
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:00,160
We're going to be talking about everything that you could think of,

363
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,480
every single angle, whatever of this model.

364
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,760
Obviously, we're not going to be teaching what we teach in the program,

365
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,000
so don't think that that's going to be the same material

366
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,280
or that we're going to replace or we're going to be talking about that,

367
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,000
but we are going to be talking about high-level stuff.

368
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,160
There may be some interviews-style stuff

369
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,480
where we bring on guests that are in the space,

370
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,200
but for those of you that want to check that out,

371
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,840
you're going to see a new episode every single week.

372
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,640
So, Aaron, I actually have the link.

373
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,440
Let me go ahead.

374
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,120
Hold on.

375
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,240
Let me see.

376
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:36,960
This will work.

377
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,840
You can still hear me, right?

378
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,040
Yeah, you're good.

379
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,520
Okay, let me just make sure this is going to work here.

380
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,200
By the way, while you pull that up, just a little shout out to Adair,

381
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,760
locked in a 2,000 a month, six-month contract just this week.

382
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,460
Okay.

383
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,760
Making moves.

384
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,400
A little $12,000, not a bad gig.

385
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,440
I like that a lot.

386
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,400
Okay, let me see if I can get this going.

387
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,120
All right.

388
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,120
Hold on.

389
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,960
By the way, I see a few new faces

390
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,000
that look like this is their first call,

391
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,440
so welcome to the call.

392
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,640
But anyway, congrats on the deal, Adair, by the way.

393
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,600
That's what this is all about.

394
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,120
It's getting that first deal.

395
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,080
That's the most important deal,

396
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,080
and then getting the next, and the next, and the next, and the next.

397
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,840
So anyway, guys, check that out.

398
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,680
Appreciate you guys, if you want to check that out,

399
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,800
great if not, no big deal.

400
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,320
But I may be asking some of you guys to come on,

401
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:40,800
share your experience, share some of your tips, strategies, et cetera.

402
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,520
So if we reach out, that would be super, super helpful.

403
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,200
Also, Aaron, you had talked about the support and everything else, correct?

404
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,680
I have not talked about that yet.

405
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,840
I was going to wait one more week with...

406
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,680
I'm warning we can't talk about that though, but...

407
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,440
No, no, no, no, no, no problem.

408
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:56,640
That's fine.

409
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,720
That's completely fine.

410
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,560
So last thing real quick, and then let's get started.

411
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,000
I want to give away some stuff, dude.

412
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,840
Let's give away a few things really quick.

413
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,840
Aaron, I'm going to have you choose...

414
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,200
So for those of you that don't know,

415
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:16,960
we just have some items that we put together that you guys can use every day.

416
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,240
We have these mouse pads.

417
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,480
We have an AirPod case.

418
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,760
We have a coffee mug.

419
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,200
We have a...

420
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:23,920
What am I missing?

421
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,720
AirPod case, coffee mug.

422
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,480
What's the last one?

423
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,000
Besides the shirts.

424
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,120
The...

425
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,800
Is that it?

426
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,160
Mouse pad, AirPod case.

427
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:36,880
I think that's main four.

428
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,640
Well, what am I missing, bro?

429
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,560
The mouse pad, the coffee mug, the AirPod case.

430
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,680
There's a fourth one, I thought.

431
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,120
And the shirt, yeah, those four.

432
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,360
Okay, I thought there's another one.

433
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,000
I could be crazy.

434
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,880
Bro, are you sure?

435
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,240
Shopdigitalandlords.com, I guess we can take it.

436
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,080
Yeah, let's look, dude.

437
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,800
But while you're doing that, just keep the ball rolling.

438
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,920
I will just have to give it to Aaron Smith.

439
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:05,520
It looks like this is his first call in the game.

440
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,960
So congrats, bro.

441
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,680
Good to have you back.

442
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,960
Jared Bell says, Fanny Pack.

443
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,040
Gotta talk to Ashley and get back.

444
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,280
It's the sticker, bro.

445
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,520
Oh, I gotcha.

446
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,640
Yeah, yeah, okay.

447
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,840
So Aaron, what am I gonna have you do?

448
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,840
I'm gonna go turn on my AC because I seem to forget every single time.

449
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,680
Will you go ahead?

450
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,560
I want you to choose, let's just say five winners.

451
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,440
I want you to give away, or four winners.

452
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:34,800
I want to have you give away a sticker, an AirPod case, a mug,

453
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,840
and a mouse pad really quick.

454
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,200
And then let's get this call rolling.

455
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,000
Okay, so real quick, let's just see.

456
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:48,160
You know what we'll do is, I'm not sure what you guys want.

457
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,280
So we'll say, Aaron, you can just message,

458
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,720
message fix it Felix in the group.

459
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:00,640
And he'll hook you up with getting you a promo code for the merch store.

460
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,640
So Aaron Smith, you got it.

461
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,000
Let me just quickly reply.

462
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,440
We'll say, and then we'll get this ball rolling with, again, 2D.

463
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,880
Usually the intros don't take this long, by the way, guys.

464
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,720
We had a few hangups with getting the call going, but it's all good.

465
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,200
So we'll say, message fix it for your swag.

466
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,040
Your swag.

467
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,680
Okay, congrats, Aaron Smith.

468
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,320
We'll say, Matthew, you're always here, bro.

469
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,640
Let's give you something.

470
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,840
Matthew Torres?

471
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,400
Yep.

472
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,440
Yeah, he's always showing up.

473
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,000
I like that.

474
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,400
Let's see, Daniel, how's it going, bro?

475
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,440
You got something too?

476
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:41,920
We got two more that we're going to give out for your swag.

477
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,520
And then let's see.

478
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,800
Stephanie, I think you've already gotten some items,

479
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,240
but it's always great to have you here.

480
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,560
Stephanie's always got that good energy.

481
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,200
Give her something.

482
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:51,760
I like that.

483
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,240
We appreciate good energy.

484
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,360
We appreciate positivity.

485
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,680
We appreciate people that have the can do,

486
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,440
I'm going to make it work attitude,

487
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,440
not everyone else's fault that I'm not making a million dollars a second.

488
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,400
Yeah, that makes sense.

489
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,160
Nick, it might be a little late.

490
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,440
If you do want to do the everyone tag,

491
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,520
you have to do it on your mobile phone, I guess.

492
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,800
So I can't because I'm not logged in.

493
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:17,200
I'm not even, I'll download Facebook on my phone,

494
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,280
but you know me, man, I'm like a drug addict.

495
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:23,280
I have to take everything off my phone or I just spend all my time on it.

496
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,880
I'll tag everyone as soon as it downloads.

497
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,840
Did we give away four?

498
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,400
We did do four.

499
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:28,960
Yep.

500
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,560
So I just messaged the winners.

501
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,520
Let's get this thing going.

502
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,360
Okay, guys, today we're going to be talking about the truth about second money.

503
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,400
I get a little bit fired up about this topic

504
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,200
because I felt like I was given misinformation.

505
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,760
And so I am excited to talk about this.

506
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,400
And I'm also excited for Aaron to give his feedback as well.

507
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,560
So let me go ahead.

508
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,680
I'm almost logged in now.

509
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,520
I may as well just go ahead and finish this off.

510
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:52,800
Hold on.

511
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,080
Let's see.

512
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,840
Okay, we're in the world groups.

513
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,680
By the way, guys, life hack, if you want to get stuff done,

514
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,640
just to get social media off your freaking phone,

515
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,600
I promise you guys, even if you don't think it helps,

516
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,360
just not just knowing you can't,

517
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,920
you don't even have the ability to click on the stupid app

518
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:19,520
is enough that I swear to you, it gives you superpowers.

519
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:24,080
So what I try to do now, I fail weekly at this

520
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,400
because I'll download it to post and then I'll leave it on like an idiot.

521
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,720
But I just try not to keep the apps on my phone.

522
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,040
And it's amazing that you start to use your brain.

523
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,160
You start to think creatively.

524
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:42,160
You start to have real conversations.

525
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,040
You start to plan.

526
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,400
And I think social media is such a powerful tool.

527
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,600
I'm never going to be the guy that's like, don't use it, don't be on it.

528
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,800
I think that's stupid, too, because you need to use it.

529
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,320
I've made a lot of money from social media.

530
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,520
I'm going to make a lot more money.

531
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,920
I think you should be building a brand and an audience.

532
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:02,720
However, I think that you should be like,

533
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,800
hey, if I'm going to be on social media, I'm producing.

534
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,840
I'm putting out content.

535
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:12,000
I'm creating networking opportunities, et cetera.

536
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,680
To sit there and scroll.

537
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,240
And again, I fail every week, so I'm not saying I'm perfect,

538
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,960
but it has been a huge deal to just delete it off my phone.

539
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,240
So that said, guys, second money.

540
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,240
Aaron, I'm curious.

541
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,280
When I say second money, what do I mean?

542
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,880
Do you have any idea what I'm talking about,

543
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,560
what I'm saying with second money?

544
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,480
I'm assuming you're saying something to the effect of an upsell

545
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,160
or selling a current customer more.

546
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:38,640
Correct.

547
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,600
So when I say second money, I'm talking about

548
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,280
you have a client and you go and you get a second money from them,

549
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,280
a third money, a fourth money, a fifth money.

550
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,560
They're already your client and you're going to go get money.

551
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:56,320
Now, guys, I want to tell you that the idea and the theory of second money,

552
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,440
it sounds so genius on paper.

553
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,520
It makes all the sense in the world, right?

554
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:05,600
Because they say getting a new client is the hardest part.

555
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,360
I don't know who's they.

556
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,640
I don't know where it's said, but I've heard that many times.

557
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,880
The hardest thing to do is get a new client.

558
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,200
The most expensive thing to do is get a new client.

559
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,520
So in theory, taking a current client and just selling them something else,

560
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,040
getting another chunk of money makes total sense.

561
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,600
And it's kind of like paper lead, right?

562
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,360
For those of you that are brand new to this group,

563
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:32,320
we hear about, you know, I always talk about how much I dislike paper lead.

564
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,000
And some of you guys are like, well, why?

565
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:40,000
You know, you get paid according to how many leads you produce and blah, blah, blah.

566
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,200
And I'm telling you guys on paper, paper lead sounds so good,

567
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,760
but in theory and practice, it doesn't work.

568
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,520
And I'm telling you guys on paper and in theory,

569
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:54,080
second money sounds amazing, but in practice, that's not how it works.

570
00:25:54,080 --> 00:26:03,360
So long story short, guys, is like, I think it was back in 2000.

571
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:03,680
I don't know.

572
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,840
It was early in my career doing this.

573
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,920
It was like 2018, 2019.

574
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,760
I was in part of...

575
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,160
Actually, let me back up just a little bit.

576
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,040
Let me give you guys really quick the game plan of what we're going to be discussing today.

577
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,960
And I'll start by saying that my goal with this live,

578
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,280
my goal with this training is that by the end of this live,

579
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:29,280
I want to basically expose to you the truth about second money, okay?

580
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:33,840
And give you guys enough information to show you that it's not exactly how it appears

581
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:39,040
and you need to consider all the costs before just going and focusing on it or asking for it, okay?

582
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,200
So here's kind of the things I'm going to cover today.

583
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,040
I'm going to be talking about this theory of second money and how genius it sounds on paper.

584
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:48,400
I'm going to be talking about why I decided to try it, okay?

585
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,920
And what I learned from it.

586
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:53,440
Then I'm going to be talking about my experience and how it went.

587
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,200
Then I'm going to be talking about what happened when I stopped doing it.

588
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,800
Then I'm going to be talking about how I actually tried to do it again

589
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,160
after I did it the first time.

590
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,560
Then how to properly...

591
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:05,840
Sorry.

592
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,480
Yeah, you know, how to properly do second money

593
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,320
because there is a proper way, I believe.

594
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,040
Then I'm going to share a friend's story with second money

595
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,560
and then I'm going to give you guys a challenge, okay?

596
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,480
So that's kind of going to be what we're going to cover.

597
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,680
I'll get through it pretty quick and then if we have questions,

598
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,080
we're going to get through those at the end as well.

599
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:28,080
So basically the theory of second money is you have a client, you go ask them for more money.

600
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,400
You have a lead gen client, you go ask them to do their SEO with you.

601
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:38,240
You have a lead gen client, you go ask them to go and use your white labeled software

602
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,240
that you're doing with go high level.

603
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:45,840
You have a client, you ask them to manage their Facebook account where you post every...

604
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,040
And guys, Aaron, doesn't it make perfect sense?

605
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:52,480
Literally on paper, it's like we don't have to go call.

606
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,360
We don't have to go cultivate any new relationships.

607
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,360
We just get new business.

608
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,360
We just get new money from current clients.

609
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,400
Am I wrong or does that not sound attractive to you?

610
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:03,760
It's attractive.

611
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,400
Have you tried it?

612
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,000
I have not.

613
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:14,240
To be fair, I haven't had that many customers to test it on, but I still hopefully wouldn't

614
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,360
because I know what you're going to say.

615
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,160
I believe it.

616
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:23,600
So I just want to say this and just real quick before we get into why I decided to try it.

617
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,280
Guys, going for second money, third money, fourth money, fifth money,

618
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:32,480
any money outside of your original lead gen money before you are printing

619
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,000
money with your first money.

620
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:34,720
Okay.

621
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,960
Obviously, if you're in this group, you should be focusing on lead generation.

622
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:44,080
Now, I know some of you guys are in a situation where you need to get some cash coming in

623
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:48,800
so you can quit your job, in which case I think the best way to do that is to do SEO,

624
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,600
just FYI.

625
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:57,600
And that's why if you guys heard me bring in Zach Powell, he has a really good process

626
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,880
for getting SEO clients and getting that.

627
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,440
But that should just be to quit your job.

628
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,680
And if you don't need to quit your job immediately or you have enough money,

629
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:12,320
I just think the long-term strategy, it's so much easier to just build a business

630
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,160
where you quit your job on lead gen money because I was in a position

631
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,920
where I didn't have money coming in.

632
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:22,400
I had to go and do SEO and it's very easy to get sucked down the SEO trap.

633
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:29,920
As sexy as it sounds, it's not scalable and it doesn't have the longevity that lead gen does.

634
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:33,120
There's just, I don't care how you set it up, it's just not the same.

635
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,120
But you guys are shooting yourself in the foot.

636
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,560
You guys are crazy.

637
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,600
If you guys are trying to go for second, third, fourth money

638
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,120
before you are printing money with your first money,

639
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:50,880
before you have your entire process automated and dialed in to the point

640
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,640
where you don't even have to be involved.

641
00:29:53,840 --> 00:30:00,160
Because guys, what ends up happening is like this second money concept,

642
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,640
you know, it's actually the same as starting another business.

643
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,240
It's actually the same as distracting yourself with a completely separate business,

644
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,240
but it disguises itself as a complimentary service.

645
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,760
And I'm going to get into my experience doing it,

646
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:22,560
but I'm just going to start and tell you upfront that splitting your attention,

647
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:26,160
splitting your focus is so detrimental to growing your business.

648
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,480
It's insane and sometimes you don't even recognize it

649
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,240
because you won't see it immediately, but it's taxing to your bandwidth,

650
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,920
it's taxing to your focus.

651
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,960
And it's going to be the death of you.

652
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,760
It's going to come at the expense of you hitting your goal, okay?

653
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:44,560
So anything that I say for, I'm going to use the term second money,

654
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:47,120
but it goes for third, fourth, fifth, sixth money, right?

655
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,840
Second money would be like SEO.

656
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,920
Third money would be like social media management.

657
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:55,200
Fourth money would be like white label software.

658
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:00,960
Fifth money could be doing swag, you know, I don't know what I'm on,

659
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,120
sixth, seventh could be consulting.

660
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,960
I mean, there's so many different layers to this because again,

661
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,800
the theory is businesses spend money on all these different things.

662
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:14,400
Let's go and get as many pieces of the pie as we possibly can.

663
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:18,480
And again, we look at some of these examples like a Warren Buffett, right?

664
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:24,800
And Warren Buffett, I think they said when you go and buy something at the store,

665
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,480
he's making money on the credit card.

666
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,760
He's making money on the Coke.

667
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,680
He's making money on like four or five different things.

668
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,040
And so we want to sit there.

669
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:34,960
We want to mimic people like Warren Buffett, but we forget that Warren Buffett,

670
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,160
he made his initial money by focusing on one thing.

671
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:41,600
And then he's now diversified into how many income streams.

672
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,040
So we confuse that when we hear we need seven income streams.

673
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:50,480
No, you need one to get rich and you need to then diversify to keep your money

674
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,680
and to grow your money.

675
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:55,760
But you need one and you should focus on one to get that initial capital, okay?

676
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:00,880
So again, guys, I want you to know that I understand that the theory of second money

677
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,600
sounds sexy.

678
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,320
It sounds fun.

679
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,080
It sounds like, hey, I've got 10 clients.

680
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:08,160
Like for example, Adair, I know he's gotten three, four, five deals

681
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,000
because I've announced all of them.

682
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,040
And congratulations, by the way, bro, that's no small feat.

683
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:20,720
But it becomes very attractive to stop doing what we know works because it's hard.

684
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,400
It's hard to go find new areas.

685
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,120
It's hard to pick up the phone and do another cold call.

686
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,600
It's hard to go and set up another ad campaign.

687
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:32,480
And it sounds amazing to take our five clients or seven clients or 10 or 20 clients

688
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:37,360
and say, hey, bro, hey, Joe, I'm going to do your SEO.

689
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,280
It sounds very, very, very attractive.

690
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:42,640
And I'm probably going against things I've said in the past.

691
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,360
But that's the beauty of business is that I'm evolving and I'm growing.

692
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,800
And maybe I'll even talk about this on the podcast this week or next week.

693
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,760
But this is from experience.

694
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:56,240
And that's the thing that I can sit here and tell you with conviction is that

695
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,800
I've tried this and I've tried it multiple times.

696
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,880
And this is how it works.

697
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,960
So guys, I'm going to tell you now why I decided to try it

698
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,120
and then what I learned from it.

699
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:12,240
So again, back in like 2000, I think 17, 18, 19, somewhere in there,

700
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,280
somebody that I was in another group, I was in multiple groups,

701
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,480
but I was the course guy.

702
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,680
I bought so many programs.

703
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:23,840
I think I spent around 23,000.

704
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,640
They have calculated 23 to 30,000 somewhere in there.

705
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,920
That's only on rank and rent programs.

706
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,040
That's only on marketing.

707
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:36,400
That doesn't include any type of like one-on-one coaching or whatever.

708
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:40,880
This is just with rank and rent specific marketing programs.

709
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:46,720
And there was a piece of advice that I got from somebody in one of these programs.

710
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:53,200
And that was that I was a fool for not going for second, third, fourth money.

711
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:57,040
And the thing that tricked me, the thing that confused me is this person

712
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,880
actually does make a lot of money.

713
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,240
They just don't make a lot of money doing this.

714
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,280
They just don't make a lot.

715
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,960
And they never did.

716
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,440
And that's the thing that we need to distinguish, guys,

717
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:11,920
is that there's a lot of people out there that are making money

718
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:16,960
by teaching things and not doing the thing that they teach.

719
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:22,000
That's basically every other person out there teaching rank and rent

720
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,120
because I know all of them.

721
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,480
There's an exception or two.

722
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,560
But majority of them, they made $10,000 one time

723
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,600
and they decided, hey, I'm going to throw together a program

724
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:37,360
and I'm going to teach people how to do this, which is cool.

725
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,320
That's great.

726
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,760
But how do you coach somebody past your skill level?

727
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,000
I talked about this a few weeks back.

728
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,560
How do you convert someone past your own conversion?

729
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,600
How do I train you how to get to $100,000 a month

730
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,880
if I've never been there?

731
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:54,560
And so be very careful because I know some of you guys

732
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,000
are in other groups.

733
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,600
Some of you guys are in multiple groups

734
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,680
and especially those of you that are in free groups.

735
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,160
I see you.

736
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,960
I see some of you guys pouring yourself out

737
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:08,880
and jumping at every single free piece of information, free PDF.

738
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,360
It's from some no name in a group.

739
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,960
If they're in the model, you don't even know if it's a human.

740
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,440
You don't even know if they even know what money is.

741
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,320
You don't know any of this stuff.

742
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,760
And I see you guys getting all these free things.

743
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,320
And guys, just because something's free

744
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,520
doesn't mean you should take it.

745
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,360
I had a dog took a freaking dump in my front yard.

746
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,560
That cost me no dollars.

747
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:37,280
I'm not going to keep the dung and sprinkle it on my garden.

748
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,040
It was free.

749
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,440
I was so pissed.

750
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,600
By the way, Aaron, I know you have dogs, right?

751
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,040
We doubt.

752
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,400
I thought you had a dog.

753
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:46,960
OK.

754
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,320
So I was going to make this announcement.

755
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,280
Maybe you guys could tell me.

756
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,640
I was so pissed yesterday.

757
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,560
We brought the boat in and I saw three piles of shit.

758
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,160
And I'm sorry because I wasn't going to curse.

759
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,120
But I saw three piles of shit on my front yard, right?

760
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,960
Is this on the artificial grass?

761
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:04,480
On my artificial grass, paid for by Dre, by the way.

762
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,920
But on my artificial grass, thank goodness

763
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,640
it was artificial grass.

764
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,600
I could spray it off.

765
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,000
But I swear to you, I have a Facebook group in my community

766
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,360
and I'm going to put on there.

767
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:14,000
And if you guys love dogs, you could be offended.

768
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,120
I don't care.

769
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,840
I'm going to take a picture of all three piles.

770
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:20,400
And I'm going to post it on our community group and say,

771
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,600
we just installed new cameras.

772
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,920
If I catch your dog taking a shit on my front yard,

773
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,440
you could pick it up at the crematory.

774
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,360
Ha ha ha ha ha in an ash box.

775
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,000
OK.

776
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
So don't eat shit on my front yard.

777
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:40,240
Anyway, just because it's free does not mean that you guys

778
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,360
should actually take it.

779
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:41,840
OK.

780
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,280
So I listen to this guy.

781
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,400
He gave me free advice and the dude makes a lot of money.

782
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,000
But he doesn't make it doing this.

783
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,640
That's the whole point of this conversation is that, guys,

784
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,920
if they don't make money doing this, why are you listening to it?

785
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,640
OK.

786
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,840
Why are you listening to it?

787
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:58,320
Dave Ramsey, perfect example.

788
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,160
Everybody listens to Dave Ramsey.

789
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,720
Dave Ramsey does not make his money by following his own advice.

790
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:13,840
That's the irony behind good old Dave and his program and his radio show.

791
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:16,800
He does not make money doing what he preaches.

792
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,680
So I don't know how that guy goes to bed at night.

793
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:23,920
It would feel really weird to me to be making a lot of money

794
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,600
and have never made a million dollars.

795
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:29,120
That's why I just shake my head at people that are like,

796
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,160
I'm going to start a program.

797
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:30,400
Good.

798
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,440
That's your choice.

799
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,080
Good luck.

800
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:32,800
OK.

801
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,560
Anyway, I decided to give this a try.

802
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,600
And the mistake that I made, guys,

803
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,640
is that I followed somebody's advice that wasn't in the game.

804
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,800
I followed somebody's advice that was making money

805
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,360
by doing something different than what they were talking about.

806
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:48,880
And so that's the biggest thing that I learned, guys,

807
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,920
is that you have like the number one thing I learned,

808
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,600
apart from the fact that it's not a good idea,

809
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,960
is that it taught me that I can't listen to anything

810
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:03,600
that this person is saying past $10,000 a month,

811
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,880
because I think this person had made like $24,000

812
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,560
in one month or two months,

813
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,080
but they hadn't made anything past that.

814
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,520
And so that was the biggest thing it taught me,

815
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,800
is that just because the thing that they're teaching me

816
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,560
worked for them in this other business,

817
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,880
it's not necessarily applicable to this business.

818
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,800
And so I want you guys to remember

819
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,840
that if nothing else inside this group, guys,

820
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:27,440
I've been to the place that you guys like so far,

821
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,840
no one has passed where I got to.

822
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,240
I got to $124,000 per month.

823
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,600
I do not know anyone that has gotten to that point.

824
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,240
And I know I see people on social media

825
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,600
talking about making $140,000.

826
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:45,600
And dude, in fact, there's a couple of brothers right now,

827
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,280
they live in my hometown,

828
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,520
and they have a program apparently, okay?

829
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,560
Never heard of these guys, never heard of them.

830
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,800
And they're posting about making $140,000.

831
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,080
So they watch all of my stories.

832
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,080
They follow me, they have for years.

833
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,760
And I've tried to reach out to them a couple of times

834
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,040
to just have a conversation

835
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,520
because I think that they're a scam.

836
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,680
So I'd messaged them literally the other day.

837
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,640
And I was like, hey guys, Nick here.

838
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,040
Love to hop on the phone and chat

839
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,160
and see what you guys got going on

840
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,520
since we're in the same town.

841
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,760
This is my second message.

842
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:23,520
And it says active like four minutes ago.

843
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,720
These guys don't read my message.

844
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,040
So I just messaged them like, hey, it's ironic

845
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,000
that you guys watch all my stories.

846
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,560
You guys are fanboys, but you can't,

847
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,080
you're pretending not to see my message.

848
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,880
Anyway, long story short,

849
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,560
these guys aren't making $140,000.

850
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,520
I promise you that.

851
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,080
I posted my tax returns inside the free group, okay?

852
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,640
My tax returns are inside the free group

853
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:49,600
for those of you that doubt the money that I've made.

854
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,600
Because it really bothered me

855
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,720
and does bother me when people just make false claims.

856
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,560
So that's the biggest thing that I learned

857
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,000
and that's what I want you guys to take away

858
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,240
is it drives me nuts when I see you guys commenting

859
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,080
inside of these other Facebook groups

860
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:05,280
and inside these other programs that I'm also a part of.

861
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,520
And you guys are just getting free stuff.

862
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:10,720
I just got an email today from another rank and rank group.

863
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,160
It's a program that I bought.

864
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,360
It's a friend of mine.

865
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,800
And he's like promoting this.

866
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,120
The dude doesn't make any money on this stuff, okay?

867
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:21,120
So just freaking listen to people that you are like,

868
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:23,520
if they haven't been somewhere you want to go

869
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,720
and stop listening to them.

870
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:28,000
So anyway, that's why I decided to try it

871
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,080
and that's what I learned, okay?

872
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,600
Now, let me tell you about my experience.

873
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,960
When I did this, when I implemented this,

874
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,120
what ended up happening is first and foremost,

875
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,640
I became very relieved.

876
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,240
Because I remember sitting there thinking,

877
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,120
wow, I hate cold calling people.

878
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:47,040
And yeah, I've made it to this point,

879
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,560
but I don't like to call people.

880
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,240
And if I didn't imagine,

881
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,320
if I don't have to call any new business owners,

882
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,000
I don't have to talk to any new people.

883
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,200
I don't have to meet anybody else.

884
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:59,120
That'd be so nice because guys, it's scary.

885
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,600
Even to this day for me to pick up this phone

886
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,240
and call strangers, it's still uncomfortable.

887
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,600
It's always gonna be uncomfortable

888
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,600
because it's always easier to talk to people

889
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,280
that you know, right?

890
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:13,760
And so I remembered my initial reaction to this is like,

891
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,920
I had a big sense of relief because I was like,

892
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,680
oh my gosh, this is gonna be so nice.

893
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,600
I'm not gonna have to talk to anybody new.

894
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,280
I'm gonna take my 10 clients.

895
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,800
I'm gonna sell them SEO.

896
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,960
Then I'm gonna sell them social media marketing.

897
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,520
And dude, I'm gonna triple my revenue, Aaron.

898
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,360
I'm gonna triple my revenue.

899
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,680
I'm gonna go from, you know, 10,000 a month.

900
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,920
Then with that first hit, maybe not even quite triple,

901
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:38,480
but let's say I sell 70% of the people on SEO.

902
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:42,400
You know, I'm gonna go from 10,000 to 17,000 like that, right?

903
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,840
And then I'm gonna sell them social media.

904
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,520
Maybe I'll only get 50% from there.

905
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:48,800
So I'm gonna be at like 22,000 bucks in a month

906
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,800
by just selling them these other services.

907
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,840
Aaron, what do you think happened?

908
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,360
You didn't triple or even double.

909
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:02,000
Not only did I not grow, my revenue actually went down, dude.

910
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,120
It actually went down.

911
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:05,620
Why?

912
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:10,240
Because, well, number one is I took my eye off the main thing

913
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,360
and the main thing is Legion

914
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,720
and that's the only thing that scales.

915
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:16,560
And so my service, my core service suffered, okay?

916
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,960
And because my core service suffered, guess what happened?

917
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,760
My referrals that I wasn't once getting

918
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:24,400
that was helping me grow my business completely dried up

919
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,600
because now those little tiny touches that I was making,

920
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:30,400
those checking in here, checking in there,

921
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,600
you guys saw me post this recently,

922
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,680
sending flowers to my customer's wife

923
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,880
because I had the mental bandwidth to do it.

924
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,720
Not that that's gonna necessarily grow your business.

925
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,280
Getting clients success and getting them results

926
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,000
is the number one thing,

927
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,480
but just those little touches,

928
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,080
I didn't even have the bandwidth for them.

929
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:51,040
So not only did my business not grow,

930
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,080
but it actually went down.

931
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:54,000
My core service suffered.

932
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,120
My referrals completely dried up

933
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:01,280
and I actually had and struggled to have a hard time.

934
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:05,120
I had a hard time retaining the clients that I did have.

935
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:08,320
My current clients then became a challenge to even keep those.

936
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:12,000
There was literally no growth and there was just frustration.

937
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,760
And actually my bottom line number went down

938
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,760
because guess what?

939
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,120
I added another service

940
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,800
and here's one of the services I offered.

941
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,320
I was so smart, guys.

942
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:25,040
I was like, I'm gonna do white label Go High Level.

943
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,080
Aaron, you haven't done that?

944
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,840
I barely know what that is, yeah.

945
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:34,080
So Go High Level is a software that used a CRM.

946
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:36,400
They have this program, it's genius.

947
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:41,200
You can go and you can pay to white label their software

948
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,520
and anything you sell above a certain price point

949
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,520
you get to keep and it's so scalable

950
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,800
and you're gonna promote it

951
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,640
and all this different stuff, right?

952
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:52,240
So that was a really cool service that I offered.

953
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:56,480
Curious, is there anybody that's like confident enough

954
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,920
or secure enough to admit in the chat

955
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:03,520
that they've tried that scam of a business model?

956
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:05,120
Has anyone done that?

957
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:06,080
I would love to know.

958
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,600
By the way, Aaron, if somebody's comments

959
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:10,400
that says they've tried it, cut me off and tell me, okay?

960
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,720
Yeah, if not, you guys are, I'm happy

961
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,320
because you guys are smarter than me.

962
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,680
But guys, guess what?

963
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,920
I didn't know how to do Go High Level.

964
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:24,080
I didn't know how to sell soft, like that kind of software.

965
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,280
I didn't know how to set it up.

966
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,040
I didn't know what, like whatever.

967
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,400
So guess what I did?

968
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,680
I went and hired somebody that was familiar

969
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:37,040
with Go High Level and I paid them, wasn't crazy

970
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,920
but I think I paid them like, for me at the time

971
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:40,880
it was really crazy.

972
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,440
It was like 3,500, 4,000 bucks a month.

973
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:48,160
So I basically, 50K a year to do this whole new service.

974
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,040
That was 50K that I had to make up

975
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,120
just to be at the same point net.

976
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,040
So that was just one service.

977
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:01,760
I also was offering SEO, third money maybe.

978
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,840
Then I was offering social media management.

979
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:07,600
Hey Joe, yeah, we actually are pretty good

980
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:08,800
at managing Facebook.

981
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:09,680
Check this page out.

982
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:13,200
We've grown our evergreen page to a thousand likes

983
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,040
and we're getting a lot of views on our videos.

984
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:16,960
We can actually give you a quote

985
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,400
on managing your Facebook page.

986
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:18,880
What do you think?

987
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:21,600
Six service, huh, Aaron?

988
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:23,040
Yeah.

989
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,000
Six is better than five.

990
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:27,680
Dude, we were an all encompassing agency.

991
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,400
We offer every service, bro.

992
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,840
A to Z, soup to nuts.

993
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:38,080
We were the full pack, dude.

994
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:41,200
We were the Michael Jordan of agencies, bro.

995
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,480
You come into our agency, we got you, dude.

996
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,520
We're getting you leads.

997
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:47,920
We're building you a new site.

998
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:49,680
We're going to do your SEO.

999
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:51,920
We can manage your Facebook.

1000
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,400
Need t-shirts, we got you.

1001
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,440
Need a CRM, check that, baby.

1002
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,680
Dude, you want consulting, call your boy.

1003
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:06,320
Dude, it's so funny because you think I'm joking, dude.

1004
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:10,640
You want merchant services, got a solution for you, dude.

1005
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:15,920
We're a full stack marketing agency, bro.

1006
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:17,520
That's it, dude.

1007
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:18,480
That's what I thought.

1008
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:24,560
How long were you chasing the non-leash end services?

1009
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,160
Stop, bro.

1010
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:31,520
Stop, stop offering these services.

1011
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:36,640
I like seven businesses, seven, dude.

1012
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:40,080
And I was telling myself that I was just a full stack

1013
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:41,520
marketing company, dude.

1014
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:43,920
A to Z, bro.

1015
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,640
Come in, dude, I got you covered, dude.

1016
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:47,600
There's something else.

1017
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:48,800
Oh, there was a point.

1018
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,040
Hold on, hold on, 2020.

1019
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:54,720
We were offering masks, masks, bro.

1020
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:56,480
I can't make this stuff up.

1021
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,080
You guys think I'm making this for like comic and dramatic effect?

1022
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:04,240
I promise you, you go ask anyone that was working with me, Francesca.

1023
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:08,880
Kyle wasn't with me at the time, but Francesca, go ask Francesca.

1024
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:10,960
This is real stuff, dude.

1025
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,000
This is pathetic.

1026
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,680
Luckily, I've moved past the point where I can like laugh about this stuff.

1027
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:16,160
Dude, I thought-

1028
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:17,920
That wasn't long ago, 2022?

1029
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:23,600
That 20, it was, so 2020 was the year we started doing this.

1030
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:24,800
Sorry.

1031
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:30,800
So 2019, so this is the embarrassing part that's funny, right?

1032
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,920
So 2018, 19 is when I first started doing this.

1033
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:38,560
And then 2020, not to cut ahead of myself, is when I stopped doing it.

1034
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:40,720
Scaled, go figure.

1035
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:43,280
Then end of 2021, I did it again.

1036
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:48,640
Then I just did it again this year and it was a completely,

1037
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:50,000
and I'll talk about that here in a second.

1038
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,040
Anyway, guys, long story short, I didn't grow.

1039
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:56,160
Now, the interesting part, I know there's probably somebody on here

1040
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:58,800
that's like, yeah, I actually just did that and I made some money.

1041
00:47:59,520 --> 00:47:59,840
Cool.

1042
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:06,080
But I guarantee that it's coming at the expense of a much bigger payday

1043
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:08,720
that you could have got if you would have just focused on Legion.

1044
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:10,240
Because guess what?

1045
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,720
I initially got a deal or two too.

1046
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,800
I got one or two people that said yes to me.

1047
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:19,360
Yeah, I got a couple SEO clients and that's what gave me the confidence

1048
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:21,840
to offer the next six services, okay?

1049
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:23,920
So here's what happened.

1050
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:26,240
2019, you guys know the story, I almost quit.

1051
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:27,280
I was tired of this.

1052
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:28,640
I was like, you know what?

1053
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,360
I'm not cut out to be a marketing agency.

1054
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:35,280
You know, six months earlier, I was full stack, baby.

1055
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:38,960
I was offering everything, dude, everything.

1056
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:40,800
And then six months later, I was like,

1057
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,480
I don't know if I'm ready to do marketing.

1058
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:43,840
I don't know if I should be in business.

1059
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:45,520
I think I should just be a sales guy.

1060
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,120
So you guys know the story, 2019,

1061
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:49,440
I just about walked away from doing business for myself.

1062
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,360
I was going to be a sales guy for somebody else,

1063
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:54,640
had everything lined out and I luckily pulled my head out

1064
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,000
and I was like, you know what, Nick?

1065
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,760
No, you have to figure this out

1066
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,280
because that's how you're going to get rich

1067
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,680
is you have to have your own thing, right?

1068
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:04,000
It's back to the Naval Ravicon, his book.

1069
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:07,200
And he talks about like how to get rich without being lucky.

1070
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:09,520
You have to own the business

1071
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,440
or at least a part of the business, right?

1072
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:15,280
That's the only way to get to the true money.

1073
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,520
And then I was like, well, this also is recurring.

1074
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,120
This also is asset-based.

1075
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:21,200
And I started checking all the boxes and I'm like,

1076
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,560
yeah, this is the right business.

1077
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:23,600
I just have to figure this out.

1078
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:28,800
So 2019, beginning of 2020, that's what I did, right?

1079
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,240
Is I got rid of everything.

1080
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:34,080
I got rid of every single thing except for Legion.

1081
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:37,120
And ironically, eight months later,

1082
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:38,640
I hit a hundred thousand dollars a month.

1083
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:43,040
No BS, no like it wasn't, you know,

1084
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:47,920
August, it wasn't June, it wasn't October,

1085
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:51,520
July of 2020, we hit a hundred thousand dollars per month.

1086
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:54,960
And eight months earlier, 2019, December,

1087
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:58,720
we barely hit like eight to 10, okay?

1088
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,040
So you'd think I would learn, but that's what happened.

1089
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:05,040
As soon as I got rid of everything, I started growing.

1090
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,080
Now I'm going to jump ahead a little bit.

1091
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:08,480
One of my buddies, I guess I'd call him

1092
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,480
more of a business acquaintance.

1093
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,880
You guys probably saw this photo I posted recently

1094
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,720
on my personal page, maybe you didn't,

1095
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,960
but I did a podcast with this guy named Dan Henry.

1096
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:21,840
He's a really sharp dude, whatever.

1097
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:25,840
It was when I was in Dubai and he shared this reel

1098
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:26,960
just the other day.

1099
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:30,400
And he said that when he started in business

1100
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:35,680
and he did really well, he got up to $250,000 per month.

1101
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:38,400
He had one program or one service

1102
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:39,760
or one product he was selling.

1103
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:40,960
I can't remember what it was at the time.

1104
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:43,920
He got to 250 and he's like,

1105
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,960
I'm going to add more products so I can get to a million

1106
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,080
or whatever he was trying to get to.

1107
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:51,680
And I think you might've heard me say this yesterday, Aaron,

1108
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:54,880
but dude, he went down from 250.

1109
00:50:54,880 --> 00:51:00,240
He added 12 or 13 products and it dropped him to 70,000 per month.

1110
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:02,480
Which is still a lot of money,

1111
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:05,680
but when you're making three and a half times that much,

1112
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,200
it's a kick in the pants, right?

1113
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,880
So apparently he joined this mastermind

1114
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:13,440
and the guy's like, tell me about your business, blah, blah, blah.

1115
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,360
He's like, yeah, 13 different offers.

1116
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:16,960
The guy was like, get rid of 12.

1117
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:20,000
Or he had 14, he said, get rid of 13.

1118
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,960
And he's like, okay, he got rid of everything but one.

1119
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,680
And he scaled up to 500,000 a month.

1120
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,960
Okay, guys, he's done it.

1121
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:29,920
I've done it.

1122
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,520
Hermosy's talked about it.

1123
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:34,080
If you guys are offering multiple services, you're stupid.

1124
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:38,480
And I hope someone could clip that and whatever, that's fine.

1125
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:41,360
But until you are printing cash,

1126
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:48,320
until your first service is an automated cash juicing machine,

1127
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:51,280
you guys are losing and costing yourself

1128
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:53,680
thousands and tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of dollars

1129
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,920
by offering multiple services, okay?

1130
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,080
So 2020, I scaled.

1131
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:03,360
Beginning of 2021, I started to think about the same idea again.

1132
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:06,080
And that's why you guys hear me talking about selling masks, right?

1133
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:09,440
2020, 2021, everyone is starting to make money and selling masks.

1134
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:14,240
I had some friends that were making supposedly big money in masks.

1135
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:16,240
And I think some of them actually did.

1136
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,880
And so I don't know how,

1137
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:23,760
but I forgot that that was the thing that caused me not to scale.

1138
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,320
And so I started offering services again.

1139
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:29,280
And I started doing this whole BS again, guys.

1140
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:34,800
And in 2021, what ended up happening is this time I made more money.

1141
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:43,360
So I went from 7,000 or 7 figures, like just over a million, to 1.4, 1.45, 1.5 million.

1142
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:44,800
This has nothing to do with this program.

1143
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,560
This is just on my business.

1144
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:51,760
But I actually did not make any additional money, bottom line.

1145
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:53,920
I made the same amount of money.

1146
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,880
I did 50% more work.

1147
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,320
And I made the same amount of money.

1148
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:03,040
How much more time did I spend away from my family?

1149
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:04,240
How much more stress did I have?

1150
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:05,600
How many more employees did I manage?

1151
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:09,520
How many dinners and golf trips did I miss?

1152
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:14,640
And I made no extra money, like literally no extra money.

1153
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:17,360
I could have done the exact same thing I did the year before,

1154
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,720
and I would have made the same amount of money,

1155
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,000
and I would have had 50% more time.

1156
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:24,320
So guys, I've heard Hermosy talk about this.

1157
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:27,920
He talks about this concept of the woman in the red dress from The Matrix,

1158
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:33,200
where it distracts you, and it's the very thing that will kill you.

1159
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:37,200
And he says that as you get bigger, as you grow,

1160
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:42,400
the woman in the red dress becomes more attractive, becomes more sexy.

1161
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,000
And I will tell you that that is true,

1162
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:44,640
because guess what?

1163
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:49,280
When I did it in 2021, I now had 30 clients.

1164
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:54,000
And the idea of offering a new service was way more attractive to me.

1165
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,240
And it was actually in 2021 that I did offer the Go High Level White Label,

1166
00:53:58,240 --> 00:53:59,600
and it sounded like such a good idea,

1167
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:02,240
because now I have 30 clients instead of 8 or 10,

1168
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:05,200
and it became more attractive, right?

1169
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:09,520
But guys, all that it was was a freaking distraction, okay?

1170
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:13,280
So I want to tell you guys really quick in these last few minutes

1171
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:16,160
is how I think you should properly do it, okay?

1172
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:20,480
Number one is you need to make sure that your core business,

1173
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:21,760
your lead generation business,

1174
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:24,240
again, for those of you that are trying to get out of your job,

1175
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:26,080
I'm not necessarily talking directly to you,

1176
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:31,280
because I would rather you do SEO to get out of your job and buy your time back,

1177
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:35,040
and then do lead gen to replace that,

1178
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:37,920
then I would have you stuck in your job.

1179
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:41,840
But for everybody else, if you're just building lead gen

1180
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:43,920
and you're okay in your job and you have a pretty good schedule

1181
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:46,160
or you work from home or you don't mind it,

1182
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:51,120
I would highly recommend you just build your income on lead gen only.

1183
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:56,720
And basically what I'm saying is until that money,

1184
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:00,480
that first money pays your bills and a lot more,

1185
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:03,440
like it's spitting off cash,

1186
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,200
it's to the point where mine is right now,

1187
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,680
where in the last six business days,

1188
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:09,920
we've gotten two deals.

1189
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:13,520
I haven't talked to the clients.

1190
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:14,800
I don't know the client's names.

1191
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:16,640
I can't even remember the second one.

1192
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:19,360
Francesca got like a small $300 a month deal.

1193
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:24,480
I have no idea where it's at, what kind of service it's in,

1194
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:25,680
what the business owner's name is.

1195
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:27,360
I don't know what state it's in,

1196
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:29,280
because I don't have to touch it anymore.

1197
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,320
Francesca does it.

1198
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:34,560
The only thing I have to do is approve when we spend money on new stuff.

1199
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:38,240
That's the only thing that I really do in the business anymore.

1200
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:41,840
Until you've gotten to like that point, then don't touch it.

1201
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:43,840
Now, that's number one.

1202
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:49,760
Number two, I personally think that you shouldn't go chasing second money.

1203
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:54,320
I think that with second money, when it starts to come to you,

1204
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:56,480
that's when it's the time.

1205
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:00,320
When second money comes to you, not one time, not two times,

1206
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:02,800
but like five times, that's when you start to go,

1207
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:04,240
all right, I have an opportunity here.

1208
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:05,600
Let me give you an example.

1209
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:07,280
I didn't start digital landlords.

1210
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:12,000
I didn't start this program until 2021 and at the end of 2021.

1211
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,560
And guys, it was literally, I'm not saying it was by force,

1212
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:15,680
because I clearly chose it.

1213
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:17,120
And obviously, you guys can do the math.

1214
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:20,480
There's great cash in it, and I'm never going to hide that.

1215
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:22,240
But I didn't seek it out.

1216
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:23,760
I was completely content.

1217
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:25,120
Of course, I thought it was a good idea.

1218
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:27,040
Of course, I knew that it would be a good idea.

1219
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:32,960
But guys, I had five, sometimes 10 people a day reaching out to me,

1220
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:36,880
asking me questions about how I was doing what I was doing,

1221
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:40,000
asking me specifics, asking me if I could jump on a call with them,

1222
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,800
asking if they could pick my brain.

1223
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:44,800
And I'm not saying this to sound cool.

1224
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:50,400
I'm saying it because I was trying to just send people videos and answer questions.

1225
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:54,000
I had this opportunity knocking at my door,

1226
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,320
and that's when I realized it was the time.

1227
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:59,600
So the way to do it is get your first money,

1228
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:03,680
humming like a machine, firing at all cylinders,

1229
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:08,080
making sure that you're basically completely detached from it.

1230
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:10,960
And then the second money is knocking at your door.

1231
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:15,040
And then, guys, what I would highly recommend is if it's not something

1232
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:16,960
that you have to be involved in, obviously in this,

1233
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:19,680
I have to be heavily involved because it's my process.

1234
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,280
It's my face on this thing.

1235
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:22,800
But let's say it's SEO.

1236
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:26,320
Let's say for some reason you got people just knocking at your door for SEO

1237
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:29,200
because all of your clients are so impressed with how you rank

1238
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,640
and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1239
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:33,920
You just have droves of people asking you for SEO.

1240
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:38,160
If that's the case, because SEO is not scalable

1241
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:39,840
and you're going to have to add new employees,

1242
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:42,480
you're going to have to add new systems and processes

1243
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:44,560
and all this different stuff to scale,

1244
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:47,360
guys, what I would highly recommend you doing

1245
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:49,440
is finding a strategic partnership

1246
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:52,080
that you can literally just refer the business to

1247
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:53,440
and never talk to them again.

1248
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:59,280
This is what I did in 2020 is I got rid of my SEO,

1249
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:01,040
which made up almost half of my business,

1250
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:02,800
about 4,000 out of the 10,000.

1251
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:06,400
I created the partnership.

1252
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:07,440
I went to someone and said,

1253
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:10,240
what if you start your own SEO company?

1254
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:11,120
Here's the split.

1255
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:13,280
I don't even want my name on the company.

1256
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:15,680
I just want you to give me 50% of the net profit.

1257
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:16,720
I don't want to talk to them.

1258
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:17,520
I'll sign the deals.

1259
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:18,800
I'll refer you to business.

1260
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:19,360
What do you think?

1261
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:20,000
They said yes.

1262
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:23,840
So when I'm talking about making seven figures in 2020,

1263
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:25,520
that had nothing to do with SEO.

1264
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:29,680
I made $6,000 to $10,000 a month that year,

1265
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:35,280
and that was completely on just basically commissions.

1266
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:37,360
That was basically on splits.

1267
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:38,320
I didn't talk to the clients.

1268
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:39,120
I didn't deal with the clients.

1269
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:40,480
I didn't do anything like that,

1270
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,320
and that wasn't included in that seven figures.

1271
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:44,240
That was completely separate money.

1272
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:45,520
That was just gravy money.

1273
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:48,560
That was blow on golf money.

1274
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:49,760
That had nothing to do.

1275
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:51,520
So I didn't have to deal with it.

1276
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:53,840
I didn't, and it's not even that I didn't have to do the service,

1277
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:56,000
but I didn't have to deal with the headache or the bandwidth

1278
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,760
or my customers being pissed off that I wasn't ranking.

1279
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:01,040
It wasn't even attached to me.

1280
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:03,280
They called me and tried to complain about it.

1281
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:04,880
See, I'm like, that's not my deal, dude.

1282
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:05,440
That's him.

1283
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:07,280
That's not my business.

1284
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:10,880
I just told you he's good, and I'll text him for you,

1285
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,560
but that has nothing to do with me, sir.

1286
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:16,240
And I would text him like, yo, this person's unhappy.

1287
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:17,040
Can you deal with it?

1288
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:19,920
That's the way I think you do second money.

1289
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:21,600
That's the way that I found that works.

1290
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:23,520
Get your business firing.

1291
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:26,560
Wait till the second money is knocking at your door

1292
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:28,880
and then find a strategic partnership.

1293
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:31,680
Now, in the case of this program, it is scalable.

1294
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:33,920
I can create the videos.

1295
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:36,160
I could create the training, and then I could sell the training.

1296
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:39,280
Obviously, we have to do the support and all this different stuff,

1297
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:40,800
but I've committed to doing this.

1298
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:41,600
I figured this out.

1299
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:43,440
It's been a work in progress.

1300
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:44,320
It is a work in progress.

1301
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:47,200
It's a big commitment, but the opportunity was knocking at my door.

1302
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:49,680
That's how I think you do second money.

1303
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:52,080
And guys, I want you to remember, for those of you that are like,

1304
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:53,360
I'm going to go start a court.

1305
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:55,200
I did this in 2016.

1306
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:03,920
Nine months of 2017, I got distracted, but I did part of 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021.

1307
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:11,200
I did it for five and a half years and made over a million dollars two years in a row

1308
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:13,520
before I even thought about this.

1309
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:15,760
So for those of you that are like,

1310
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:19,440
I'm going to go rip some all-encompassing services.

1311
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:22,080
I'm going to go do the full-stack marketing agency.

1312
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:23,760
Could be a stupid, okay?

1313
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:27,680
So guys, here's my challenge to you guys is get focused.

1314
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:28,960
Get stupid.

1315
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:29,760
Get simple.

1316
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:31,360
What's this kiss?

1317
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:32,960
Keep it stupid simple, right?

1318
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:34,960
Keep it stupid simple.

1319
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:36,480
Focus on one service.

1320
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:38,960
Stop doing second money.

1321
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:44,400
One service, one offering, one niche, one deal structure, one sales process,

1322
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:46,240
and a bunch of money.

1323
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:47,840
That's what I want to recommend to you guys.

1324
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:49,920
That's from experience, not from theory.

1325
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:51,200
Thanks for being on the call, guys.

1326
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:52,480
I will see you guys next week.

1327
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:52,960
Thanks, Aaron.

1328
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:53,840
All right.

1329
01:00:53,840 --> 01:01:02,560
Take care.
