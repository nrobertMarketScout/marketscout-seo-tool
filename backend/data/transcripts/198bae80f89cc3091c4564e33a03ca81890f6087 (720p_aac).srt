1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,920
Top keyword or keywords. That's one of the mistakes I made you have to do multiple keywords when I was in these other groups

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:11,040
I thought you just went in and let's say it's concrete or concrete contractors

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,440
You just type in concrete contractors st

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:18,940
George, Utah, and if it looks good you send it and if it doesn't you don't guys

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:26,920
You're gonna be ranking for different keywords that keyword might be super difficult and the other four or five six

6
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,120
67 are layups, dude. No one's competing

7
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:37,000
I'll go and take all the traffic for those four rank for those four and that's gonna help and it's gonna bleed over and

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,600
It's gonna allow me to rank quicker for the main keyword, right?

9
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:48,160
If the main keywords concrete likewise are on the flip side you go and do the research and that top keyword is a laydown

10
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,880
Oh, man, there's not even dude all the people in the maps. They don't even have a website shit

11
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:59,880
It's gonna be easy little do you know if you looked at six keywords the other five they're gonna be a beast, dude

12
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,800
They're gonna be a bitch. It's gonna be really difficult for you to rank

13
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,120
And if you looked at the big picture, you'd realize yeah, you might be able to rank for that keyword

14
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,580
But there's a lot more traffic hiding over here

15
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:14,560
So it's got to be multiple keywords and in the training we talk about how to build that keyword list

16
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,080
But here's what also school we have 400 plus members in here Theo

17
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,280
If you have a niche you're looking at just ask what key what's the keyword list?

18
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,960
Okay, and I'll probably say have you already built one? Let me see it and I'll then I'll send you mine

19
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,960
Okay, I've got nothing to hide. I'm happy to share
