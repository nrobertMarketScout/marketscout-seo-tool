1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,360
Okay. Beautiful. Okay. So guys, uh, welcome to our first, uh, not our first training,

2
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:16,680
but our first training with this format. Um, the reason I wanted to shift to this is because,

3
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:22,160
and I don't know if you guys follow me on, on social media or I don't care if you do,

4
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,600
if you want to, that's great. If you don't, it's fine. But as I've gotten like more into

5
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:34,080
business, I've realized that quality is always better than quantity. And I think in the beginning,

6
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,760
when I started my Facebook group, definitely when I had my, you know, my social media,

7
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,640
it was always like, how many likes, how many live viewers can you get? How many group members,

8
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,600
all these different things. And that's just kind of natural as humans. And, um, I realized that,

9
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,760
like, I was talking to a lot of people that weren't even interested in taking action.

10
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,440
And so the whole purpose of doing these kinds of calls is I want to give more value on

11
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,600
to be able to give you guys more value. The people that are receptive and are actually

12
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,880
ready to implement what I'm going to teach today, they're ready to take action. You're the ones that

13
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,760
I want to give priority to. So this is the new format going forward. Okay. Now, just because you

14
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,720
were on today's call doesn't mean that you can't be on next week's call, but we are going to be

15
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,280
doing these live every single Monday. Um, and we're going to be doing them at the same time,

16
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,480
just to keep consistent. The only time that would change is if I am in the air, which I'm going to

17
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,880
try not to do a flight on a Monday. So, um, I know it's a little early for some of you guys.

18
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,840
It's like six 30 for MST. I'm in Dubai. So I'm trying to like, it's like a 10 hour difference.

19
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,640
I'm trying to do my best, but, um, really truthfully, I do not care. And Aaron and I,

20
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,200
when we put up this post, we were like, dude, it was, you know, it's our first time doing it.

21
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,400
And we're like, we probably won't have a ton of engagement because we're going to get this post

22
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,560
up late. And we had like 50 plus people that commented. I don't know if all of them got the

23
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:56,240
link, but, um, I don't really care about how many people are on this call. And I promise you,

24
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,840
even if one of you, I showed up, I'm going to run this call because I prepared for it. And

25
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,760
that's what I'm going to do. So again, like I told you guys, I'm not going to be posting this

26
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:08,080
anywhere else. That's just going to be here. So, um, keep in mind guys, what I'm going to be sharing

27
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,280
today, uh, it's not going to give you guys a hundred percent of the information that you need

28
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:19,760
to build a successful digital real estate agency. Um, like there's no way I can cover that in 40

29
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,320
minutes. And I just want to like start with that. There's no way I can cover everything in 40

30
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:29,600
minutes period. And, and truthfully speaking, that's why we created digital landlords. Everything's on

31
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:36,720
the inside. However, um, my goal on this call is literally to do exactly what I did, what I used

32
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:43,120
to build my, my agency, my rank and rent digital real estate agency to seven figures. And you guys

33
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,640
know that like at the, at the core of what I believe is that we always give value before we

34
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,360
even ask for a conversation before we even ask to like talk about business, talk about doing business

35
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:59,600
together. We give value and our value is giving them what they want and what they want is our

36
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:05,520
leads. Right. And so really that like my whole belief is like give ridiculous value upfront,

37
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:12,320
charge nothing for it, right. Give value. That's so good. Give leads that are so good. They might

38
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:20,080
even, they hopefully will make money from those leads and like just give them that real,

39
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,480
those real exclusive leads, absolutely free. Right. That's, that's the whole, like that's at

40
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,200
the core of our strategy. And the reason that we do that is because guys, the hardest objection

41
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,320
to overcome, if you've done sales, if you haven't done sales, it doesn't matter, but you'll learn

42
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:39,840
this. The hardest objection to overcome is trust. I don't care how good your product is, how good it

43
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:46,640
looks, how good your website is, how nice your polo is and your brand. And if people do not trust

44
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,120
you, they will not buy from you. And that's just the reality. And on, on the flip side, you could

45
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,640
be in your mom's basement. You could look like grungy and not that professional. And if people

46
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,680
trust you, they are going to buy from you. Okay. And so the reason we give the free leads is we

47
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,000
know that the hardest objection to overcome is trust. And that is the very thing that overcomes

48
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,240
trust. So ultimately, when we give leads, our purpose isn't to give leads, just to be a good

49
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:16,960
person. Our goal is to give free leads so that they will eventually work with us. And that's

50
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:20,320
the whole strategy. And then we're not hiding that. And I'll tell my business owners, when I call a

51
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,360
business owner, I'm like, Hey, hey, Pete, I want to give you a couple of free leads. Look, just to be

52
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,680
completely straight with you, I want to earn your business. That's my goal here. However, I don't

53
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:35,360
even want to talk about it until I've given you, until I've let you try out my business at absolutely

54
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,040
no charge. Basically, I'm going to give you some free leads. So guys, I want to let you guys know

55
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,440
upfront that for me, that is no different. I've never hit that. And so at the end of the day,

56
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,960
the reason I have the Facebook group, the reason I add value, the reason I'm doing calls like this

57
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,800
is that I want to earn your business, right? At some point, whether it's digital landlord or

58
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,120
something else that I'm doing, I want to earn your business eventually. Okay. I want you, just like

59
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,360
I want your business owners to be so impressed with your free stuff, with your free leads,

60
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,840
that not only can they not wait to get more, but you leave them or I leave you wondering like, dude,

61
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,280
what would it be like to be able to get on calls with this guy every single week to have access

62
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,880
to this guy every single week to be, have access to that energy every single week inside of his

63
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:19,040
group, inside of his like inner circle. And so anyway, long story short guys, that is the whole

64
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,960
purpose. And I don't ever want this to come across like I'm this magnificent person that just wants

65
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:28,560
to give stuff away. No matter what it is, there's always something in it for everybody. And so for

66
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,640
me, I just understand that if you give value upfront without asking for anything,

67
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:36,480
then the people that are ready will eventually buy. And so that's, that's why I want to do these

68
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:41,440
more intimate sessions. Cause if you're on this call right now, it's because you are looking to

69
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,640
either take your current business to a new level or to start getting into this business. Okay.

70
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:51,760
So that said guys, if at any time during this, I think what I'll do, Aaron, can you still hear me

71
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:58,320
by the way? I don't see. Yeah, you're good. Okay. Cool. What I'll have you do is,

72
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:06,560
yeah. Are you, does it say your co-host still? Yeah. Okay. Then we'll just leave it like that.

73
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,800
Just keep an eye on stuff and then let me know if you see anything come in. Okay. I got you.

74
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:18,880
Okay. Guys, all that said, just to get that out of the way upfront, we, it is 42. This is probably

75
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:25,120
going to be, I'd say 25 to 30 minutes. What I'm going to talk about right now, maybe less.

76
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,520
And then I want to have some time for some questions. Okay. So I want to get right into

77
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:35,760
what I want to talk about today. And essentially what I want to do is I want to preface this whole

78
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:41,120
concept of picking the perfect city. And then I want to talk about like the, the, the, the,

79
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,920
the, there's like, to me, I wrote down rules, right? That I have for picking the perfect city.

80
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,240
And so basically I'm going to give you my rules for picking the perfect city.

81
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,080
And they're kind of basically like tips and things that I live by their principles that I live by

82
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,000
when picking the perfect city. So that's going to be the format of this, but this is, I want you

83
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,400
guys to know, this is from somebody that has, I've actually analyzed personally over a thousand

84
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,920
niche and city combinations. Okay. Personally, that's not including my VA's that I trained to

85
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:11,760
do. However many else I have done this so many times, it's ridiculous. I've looked at so many

86
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:16,080
cities. I know some of the weirdest cities. In fact, I'll meet people sometimes and they'll be

87
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,840
like, yeah, I'm from Virginia. And then I'll be like, oh, which part? They're like, well,

88
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,040
you don't know. And I'm like, you'd be surprised. And they'll tell me to sit them like, oh yeah,

89
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,840
I know where that's at. And they're like, how do you, I'm like, because I've looked at maps,

90
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:31,840
like I'm a geography teacher. So I've done this a lot guys. And that's why I know like what I'm

91
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,720
talking about. And I don't want you to trust that. I know what I'm talking about. I want you to put

92
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:40,400
this into practice and basically like test what I'm talking about. Okay. So a little bit of preface.

93
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:47,600
Hands down, this is the most important step in the process. And I genuinely mean that if you look at

94
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:53,440
my material inside of digital landlords, when I built it, I didn't even realize this. But as I

95
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:59,920
started like recording, like my material of the process I was doing, I'm like, oh my gosh, my

96
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:07,440
section on niche selection and picking the perfect city, the due diligence process is the biggest

97
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,600
section in our training, which would blew my mind because I never even realized. I thought it was

98
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:17,040
like maybe the closing or whatever. This right here guys is the most important step in the process,

99
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:21,680
because if you do this correctly, it makes everything else easier. If you do it incorrectly,

100
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:27,040
everything else is going to be harder. Okay. So there's a reason why today I'm not starting

101
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:31,520
off with talking about niches. I'm not starting off with talking about niche ideas, which we may

102
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,200
get into in the future because it's always a fun topic to generate ideas, tell you guys about new

103
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,480
niches. And the reason why, and again, these are just some preface points I want to come up with

104
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:47,040
and want to remind you of is that I am a huge believer, okay, that you should be going into

105
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:54,080
boring niches, AKA tried and true niches until you have retired yourself. Okay. And by the way,

106
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,160
when I say retired yourself, that means you have enough money coming in from this model

107
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:03,520
that your bills are paid for and you no longer have to work a job and everything else is gravy.

108
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:07,920
Okay. So whatever your number is, if you're a college student and, you know, you live on

109
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,840
ketchup and potato chips, you have a car that's paid for and you live in your mom's basement,

110
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:17,360
which I, no judgment, you're in a great position. You might only need one deal and then you're

111
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,760
covered and everything else you can go take a chance, you can take a risk on. Until you hit

112
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,720
that point, I'm a huge believer, stick to the tried and true, stick to the boring, because it

113
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,960
eliminates half the equation. You got to get the niche right, you got to get the city right,

114
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,560
you got to get the combination right. So if we can eliminate one of it, which is the niche,

115
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,760
we already know concrete is good. We already know artificial grass is good. We already know that

116
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,520
spray foam is good. We already know that masonry is good. We already know that fencing is good.

117
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:46,240
We already know that tree service works. We've just eliminated 50% of the equation.

118
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:54,080
Now we could focus on this part, which is getting extremely good at the city. Okay. So as a reminder,

119
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,720
like if something works, like what you're going to find out is you're going to be okay,

120
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,080
I'm going to follow Nick's advice, and then you're going to get to like 5,000 a month.

121
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:06,240
Okay. And you're going to realize like, why the heck would I go chase some crazy niche when I

122
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,240
know this works and I can just do it again and again and again and again. And that's what I did

123
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,520
is I was like, I'm going to get to this like certain point. And then I'm going to start

124
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:17,440
looking at that. Like, you know, the riches are in the niches. I'm going to find that crazy one

125
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,600
no one's ever talked about. And then I got to like 15, 20, 30 and like, dude, I'm just going

126
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,400
to keep going. Like, I don't, I don't care what niche it's in. Just, I care about the money.

127
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:30,800
Right. So just as a reminder, that's why I'm talking about the city. I'm not necessarily

128
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,480
talking about niche and city. I'm talking about just city because I'm assuming you guys are not

129
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,840
stupid. And I'm assuming you guys are going to listen to what I'm saying and realize, oh,

130
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:42,240
that makes sense. Let me eliminate half the equation. And I only have to solve half of it.

131
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,080
Focus on the city, go into the boring niches. I'm not saying you have to do concrete, talk a lot

132
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:51,200
about concrete, but do a boring niche, focus on getting good at picking a city, go get yourself

133
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,080
out of the rat race, retire yourself, quit your job. And now you could start

134
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:01,280
messing around with new niches. Okay. So, um, a couple more things really quick. I bought a

135
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:06,720
program back in 2016, my very first program that taught me how to do this stuff. And, um, that

136
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,920
program had an antiquated process for picking a city and niche. It had an antiquated process. And

137
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:17,200
it to fair in fairness to the person that created this program, I believe that their process at one

138
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:22,320
point did work. I believe it was really good, probably like three years before. But by the time

139
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,320
I got into it, by the time I was serious about it and I was actually following the advice, it was

140
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,880
antiquated. Okay. Um, a couple of things that were wrong with it. Number one, and you guys might have

141
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,720
heard this in other programs. Some of you guys, I guess a lot of you guys probably bought other

142
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,200
programs and I want you to listen to what I'm saying. You probably will relate. I kept hearing

143
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,040
the same thing over and over. The riches are in the niches, the riches are in the niches,

144
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,480
the riches are in the niches. And I just believed it. I was like, yeah, that makes sense. Right? Like

145
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,000
if I can go into something that no one's ever thought of, I can completely dominate that niche

146
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,720
and I'll just be the only one. And it's completely wide open, blue ocean, whatever. And so guys,

147
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:00,880
I spent six months doing basically a website in every single niche. You can think of all the

148
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,160
ones that you probably shouldn't go into and all the ones you guys have thought of the plumber,

149
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:09,680
the HVAC, the electrician, the carpet cleaner, the towing. I mean, all the ones that I hate,

150
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,920
I did because I, I just was told, you know, the riches are in the niches and you need to test all

151
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:19,280
this different stuff. And I was thinking, I spent hours analyzing niches and looking at home advisors,

152
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:24,320
different, you know, niche categories and looking at billboards and looking at flyers in the mail

153
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:30,160
and like so much time. And then I would build, let me try this. Guys, I had this bag of websites

154
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:36,480
with no money coming in. Okay. That was number one. And so I ended up with basically a website

155
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,520
in every possible niche you could think of with very little money. Okay. And the money that I did

156
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:46,640
have coming in was in the tried and true niches. Go figure. Right. Okay. And the crazy part is guys,

157
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:55,600
is I continued on this for like three years from 2016 until the end of 2019. I continued just not

158
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,360
listening to the, like the advice I'm giving you right now and just following that training,

159
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,440
which was like, keep building in niches and you're one day going to find it. And three years in,

160
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,240
I was making eight to $10,000 a month. I was, by the way, making less than I was doing door to door

161
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:14,240
sales, working more hours. And by this point, I had stacked up 60,000. If you guys don't know

162
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:21,760
my story, then I, at this point I'm $60,000 in debt. Okay. And like, I just felt completely

163
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,240
hopeless. And luckily I realized this still was the perfect model, but there were just some,

164
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,480
some problems with the training that I was in. And I needed, one of them was I need to figure out

165
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,760
how to pick up the right city and the right niche combination. Okay. And so anyway, long story short,

166
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:40,880
guys, is that what I realized is that, and this is something you guys need to remember.

167
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:46,400
If you go into a boring niche, and I'm going to say boring as in tried and true, concrete,

168
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:50,720
tree service, spray foam, all the stuff we thought of, everyone else has probably thought of it too.

169
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:58,640
Right. Which means you need to find an obscure or a weird city. Okay. And so what do you think about,

170
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:02,320
what do you think everyone else is looking at? When they pull up a map, they're looking at all

171
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,360
the cities that you could see. You know, when you pull up a map, you could see Raleigh, North

172
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,600
Carolina, Salt Lake City, Utah, Las Vegas, Nevada, and then you zoom in a little bit more,

173
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,560
maybe it's going to show the next layer. Right. If it's a city you know of,

174
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:19,680
probably everyone else knows of it. Okay. So just remember if it's a boring niche,

175
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:24,480
you're going to need an obscure city, a city that no one, that the average person wouldn't

176
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,960
think to look at unless they'd been trained to look like I'm going to train you today. Okay.

177
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:36,560
And on the flip side is if you guys can do the opposite, which is if at some point you find that

178
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:43,600
weird niche, then you have the ability to go into more boring or big cities because no one really

179
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,080
is in that niche. Okay. But it's much easier in my opinion, because everyone's trying to focus

180
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:54,320
on the weird niche and the big city to go into the boring niche and the obscure city, because no one

181
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,040
wants to go into the obscure cities. No one wants to go into Bentonville, Arkansas. Nobody wants to

182
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,760
go into Queen Creek, Arizona. Nobody wants to go into these places because it's not what you hear

183
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:09,360
of it. It takes effort. It takes knowing what to look for. Okay. So basically guys, I started

184
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:15,280
testing this. I realized that like, okay, why don't I just focus on the boring niches? Why don't I

185
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:20,960
focus on the stuff that I know works? Right. And then I'll focus on the cities. And I started

186
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:24,960
doing this, and I picked one niche at the beginning of 2020. And I said, I'm going to

187
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:30,080
focus on one niche. That was Tree Service. And I had a bunch of other sites that were ranking

188
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,600
generating leads. I'm like, and I'll try to sell these at the same time. Guys, I focused on Tree

189
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:39,280
Service. And that is the year that we did seven figures. We went from eight to $10,000 a month in

190
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:49,120
December of 2019. In July, we did $100,000 a month. It's bananas. Looking back on it, I didn't even

191
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:54,000
realize the wave I was riding, but it was just working. And I didn't have time to step back and

192
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,360
look at like, oh my gosh, we're growing. I didn't even know we did $100,000 that month until the

193
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,560
month got over. And I started looking at the Stripe accounts. I was like, oh my gosh, we did it.

194
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:11,440
We did $100,000. And it just continued from there. So this is exactly one of the primary pieces of

195
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:17,040
the puzzle before I was able to scale is dialing in this process. And unfortunately for me,

196
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,600
nobody could teach it to me because I didn't know anyone that was actually making big money

197
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,560
in this business. They were all making big money selling coaching programs.

198
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:30,720
But fortunately for you guys, I've done it. I figured it out and I'm going to share it with you.

199
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,280
And so basically what happened from there, guys, to wrap this up,

200
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:41,120
for those of you that don't know me, seven figures in 2020, just barely over a million. We just

201
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:49,280
barely passed it. 2021, I did $1.45 million. And then by the end of 2021, my inbox was inundated

202
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:54,640
with people asking me how the hell I was selling so many deals and had the same training as them.

203
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:58,400
And I was doing everything completely different because you guys know I do pre-selling.

204
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:04,480
And I kind of shifted the model on its head and figured this out. And so in 2021, at the very end,

205
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:10,400
it was like December 1st, we launched Digital Landlords. So that's the story. And that's why

206
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,320
maybe you ought to listen to me. And you also don't have to. So guys, let's talk about

207
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:21,840
these rules that I have. These are principles that I have. And I would highly encourage you guys to

208
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:30,880
take notes if you can. Take notes of what I'm about to say because these are principles that

209
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:36,400
I like legitimately, if I'm doing a city, it has to check these boxes. So I'm just going to

210
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,880
go through these. And then any questions you guys have, I'm going to let you guys ask them.

211
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,840
Okay, so here's these are my principles for picking a good city. Obviously, guys,

212
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:49,280
like I told you at the beginning, this isn't I want you guys to remember, this isn't like

213
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,760
enough information to just go build a seven figure agency, because I can't cover that in 40 minutes

214
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:59,600
or, you know, whatever. But this is enough to get you started. To get the wheels turning to get you

215
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,760
guys like thinking in the right direction and putting your focus in the right direction. Okay.

216
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,960
So here's the rules that I live by here, the principles I live by when picking the perfect

217
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:14,480
city. Again, coming from doing this over 1000 times again coming from making millions of dollars,

218
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:20,240
not selling my program digital landlords, not doing consulting, but doing exactly what you guys

219
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:25,200
are doing, which is building simple websites, ranking them on Google, renting them out. In my

220
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:31,040
case, I like to rent them out, then build them, and then make the money completely backwards,

221
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:35,680
but you get the concept. Okay. So guys, let's go through this. Number one, guys, and these aren't

222
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:40,320
in no particular order, but they all matter. Number one, number one rule, number one principle

223
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:47,920
for picking the perfect city is that population does not matter. Okay, now I know that it in

224
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:52,560
many courses, by the way, if you are in a course, I promise you I've been in it, I have it. I know

225
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:59,360
who they are, probably a friend of mine. Maybe not, but population doesn't matter. It's crazy.

226
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:04,080
The first training I got told me that I should look at population. I can't remember like 100,000

227
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:12,240
to 250 or 500. It was based on population. Okay. Population does not matter. Here's why.

228
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:19,440
Let me tell you what does matter. Search volume, the demand, search volume relative,

229
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:25,760
that's what you guys should remember, search volume relative to competition is what matters.

230
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:33,120
Okay. Let me repeat that. Population does not matter. Search volume relative to competition

231
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:39,760
does matter. Okay. And I always give this example. If I were to offer you a website and I said,

232
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:44,480
I'm going to gift you one of my websites, I'm going to give, I have so many ranking websites

233
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,640
and you've got two options. Okay. Number one option, and this is by the way, it's going to

234
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:53,840
be an artificial grass. I'm going to give you, you can either get a website that's ranked in,

235
00:19:54,480 --> 00:20:01,760
you know, Manhattan, New York, one of the most populous cities ever, I think. In fact,

236
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:07,440
maybe I better check. I think it's super populated. Maybe I better check before I give you guys.

237
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:15,760
Hold on. Okay. 1.6 million people. Yeah, that's good. That's a good example. You can have a

238
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:22,080
website, you can have an artificial grass website in Manhattan, or you could have an artificial

239
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:30,240
grass website in Queen Creek, Arizona. Both are ranked, both have a GMB. Which one do you choose?

240
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:37,360
Okay. Now, this kind of extreme example, and I'm using Manhattan because kind of a concrete jungle,

241
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:42,080
but the point is that if you're going off population, you'd say all day long Manhattan,

242
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:47,120
right? But anyone that's like lives in Manhattan or knows Manhattan, it's basically like,

243
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,120
it's like apartments, right? It's completely concrete. I know that there's probably some

244
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,960
outskirts and then whatever, whatever, whatever. But you'd know the point that I'm making. Queen

245
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,360
Creek, Arizona, I think it's like 30,000 population. Let me check. It's growing,

246
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:07,040
which is another one I'm going to talk about. Queen Creek, Arizona population is 59,000. It's

247
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:14,400
literally like less than a tenth and like less than a twentieth of Manhattan. And I'd probably

248
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:20,800
take Queen Creek, right? Because Queen Creek, Arizona is an area that checks all the other boxes.

249
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,840
Got a bunch of people looking for turf because of the climate and because it's growing and because

250
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:30,320
of just a number of different things. So I want you guys to, and I've looked at the numbers and

251
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:35,520
I would take Queen Creek, which sounds bananas. It sounds crazy, but that's true. So just remember

252
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,920
as my first principle and what you guys should adopt as well. I guess you don't have to, I hate

253
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:44,560
to say you should, but you should consider is that population doesn't matter. Okay. Again,

254
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:50,400
this is from experience. This is not because I read it in a book. Number two, I kind of already

255
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,560
alluded to this, but if you can see it on a map, it's probably not going to be worth your time.

256
00:21:54,560 --> 00:22:00,240
Okay. If you pull up in a map, USA, Australia, whatever, I don't, it doesn't matter guys. This

257
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,160
works in, throughout the world, right? Depending on the city you're in, depending on the, how

258
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:10,320
people search, how people do business. Not every country is great with this yet, but depending

259
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:15,760
where you pull up in a map, if you can see the city with that opening view or one or two clicks,

260
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,320
one or two zooms, and I probably would go further and say, if you know about the city,

261
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:25,040
it's probably not where you want to go because most likely it's what everyone knows. If it's

262
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:30,800
the Salt Lake City, Utah, if it's the Los Angeles, California, if it's the, if it's the Las Vegas,

263
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:35,920
Nevada, if it's the Denver, Colorado, if it's the Albuquerque, New Mexico, if you're going to be in

264
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:40,960
the boring niches, like I suggest you're going to want to go into more obscure cities. Okay. So

265
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:46,000
it's just a quick rule of thumb. If I know about it, if it's like I could see it on a map,

266
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,960
I'm probably not going to go into it. Okay. That's, and again, that is assuming that you're

267
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,360
in a boring niche. And just a quick reminder that if you're in a boring niche, you're going to need

268
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:01,200
an obscure weird city. And if you're an obscure niche, you can usually find those bigger cities

269
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:08,160
because no one's in them. But if you can find both a boring niche, like a tree service and a big city

270
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:14,000
that's got no competition, you have found literal gold. But I would also recommend that you don't

271
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,760
go chasing it because you, it's not worth your time. You usually stumble upon these things. Okay.

272
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,280
Just so you know. Okay. So that's number one. Number one is population doesn't matter. Number

273
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:28,800
two, if you could see it on a map, it's probably not worth your time. Number three, certain states,

274
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:33,120
I'm going to talk about the U S on this one. This is applicable to U S and I would guarantee

275
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:38,320
this is probably applicable to every country and certain cities, but certain states in the U S

276
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:46,560
suck for ranking. Okay. Certain states suck. And the number one state, if you guys follow my content,

277
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:52,960
you probably know it's California. I, if you call me and you're one of my family members and you

278
00:23:52,960 --> 00:24:00,480
want leads, that may change my mind for that specific like specific situation. And I would

279
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:05,360
still probably like think about it. Okay. Other than that, you're not catching me in California.

280
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,520
I've tried it. I've done it. I've been there and I can't even put my finger on what it is.

281
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:15,280
I just would recommend, I would just recommend you stay out. And maybe some of you guys are thinking

282
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:18,400
I'm trying to get you to stay out. So I'm going to go and you guys can check with any of my team. I

283
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:25,040
have zero websites in California. Zero. Well, I did, but for whatever the case is, it seems like

284
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:29,520
people are, when you, when you cold call, it's, you know, you try to get someone on the hook,

285
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:34,720
people are leery because someone's always trying to scam them. The leads just seem to be a little

286
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:40,640
bit kind of weird. You got people that want to overly check the licensing. It's just a weird

287
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:45,920
state. And again, I can't tell you why I'm just telling you from experience. I'm not going into

288
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:49,920
California. It's one of my rules. If it's in California, I'm out. Okay. Certain states suck.

289
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:56,320
Another state that I find very difficult for whatever reason, only from experience is New

290
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:03,280
Jersey. I don't know why. I don't know what it is, but those two states have been extremely

291
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:08,080
difficult. I will not go into California. I won't look at New Jersey, but if I get a referral in

292
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:12,160
New Jersey, I might look at it. But I know it's not something I'm going to go look at. I also

293
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:16,400
think it's weird because it's set up weird. There's not, it's kind of like just spread out.

294
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:22,320
Those two states to me are, are terrible. Okay. Prove me wrong. And I'm sure that you can make

295
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:29,360
money in California. But the thing I look at is like, yeah, I can, but why? Who am I proving?

296
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:36,000
What am I proving it to who? Right. So, um, certain states suck, namely California. Okay.

297
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:42,640
That's number three. Number four, weather and seasonality do actually matter guys.

298
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:49,520
Weather and seasonality do matter. So one of the things that I do, one of my principles is I look

299
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:55,120
at the states and cities with, with, by the way, real quick, as I'm going through these principles,

300
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,240
if you have follow-up questions to these principles, please start dropping them in

301
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:03,600
the comments so that we can start getting, um, those questions, um, so that I can just get

302
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,680
through them at the end. So we don't have like a lag. If you have any questions regarding any of

303
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:13,120
these like principles, I'm giving you these rules, these laws that I follow, just drop them in the

304
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:19,360
comments. Okay. Weather and seasonality do matter. This is number four. Okay. I always first am when

305
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:24,560
I'm looking at a, at a specific niche, I'm going to look at the cities that have, and sometimes

306
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:30,240
it's not the, or sorry, the states that have the most moderate weather. And unfortunately California

307
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:35,920
sucks because California is like the best moderate weather. Even with the most moderate weather, I'm

308
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:41,440
still like the, the state trumps I'm out. Like I, the fact that I don't like to say that trumps the

309
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:47,520
fact that it's got good weather. Does that make sense? Um, nonetheless, uh, I always look at

310
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:54,720
states that have like moderate weather. So Florida, Florida, like it, you know, it's got pretty decent

311
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:02,480
weather year round. Um, Arizona, pretty decent weather year round. Nevada, decent, moderate

312
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:07,680
weather year round, right? Even parts of Utah. And I know this cause I have a house in St. George,

313
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:15,200
Utah, which is very close to Vegas, very moderate weather, right? And it, it does get hot. I guess

314
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:20,400
I might want to even tweak what I'm saying. Seasonality matters, but also like when it, like

315
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:26,960
try to stay away from places that just dump snow is maybe a less elegant way of saying it, right?

316
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:33,040
A less elegant way of saying it. Um, but like St. George, Utah, for example, it never snows. And so

317
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:38,080
people are always pouring concrete. Tree service is happening year round. Does it slow down a bit?

318
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:43,040
Yeah, but it doesn't stop. Okay. So it does actually matter. So Florida, Arizona, Nevada,

319
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:48,160
et cetera. Now you guys can, I want to tell you guys this cause let's say you were listening to

320
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,920
this right now and you're like, Oh my gosh, I have this website in this state, in this city,

321
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:58,160
and I probably made a mistake because you can still get deals. It's okay. I've done it.

322
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,360
What you have to do though, is if you go into North Dakota, heaven forbid you do concrete in

323
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:07,360
North Dakota, you're going to have to realize in the winter, it's going to stop. And so you're

324
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:11,760
going to have to sell that deal and you're going to have to set expectations up front that, Hey,

325
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:17,120
just so you know, like the winter is going to shut off, but you're going to keep paying me

326
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,640
because I'm not going to charge you as much during the hot months. Like you have to,

327
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,360
again, this is something that we cover inside of our training with our scripts, but it's,

328
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:29,600
you have to position it correctly. Okay. You have to position it very, very well. It is doable. I

329
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:35,760
would just highly recommend you try to stay away from like extremely cold States. Okay. And the

330
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:41,040
reason I say that is because like it's, it's just, it's tough. It's tough guys. I'm trying to make

331
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:47,840
this as easy as possible myself. Okay. Okay. Number five. And this, this isn't, this one kind

332
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:52,560
of goes hand in hand with, this is more of like a reminder. This kind of goes hand in hand with the

333
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:59,920
first one, but it's just a kind of a rule to remember is bigger population usually means

334
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:09,680
more competition. Bigger population usually means more competition, not always, but most often

335
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:16,000
bigger competition. There's a reason why Dallas is almost always impossible to rank a website.

336
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
And so there's a reason why Dallas is going to be one of the hardest places to get your website to

337
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:25,280
number one, because it's Dallas, it's Fort Worth, it's Arlington, it's this big DFW area. And there's

338
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:29,040
so many people there that businesses are like, Oh, if I could just be in this area, there's

339
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:32,720
unlimited customers. And you're thinking that and they're thinking that and everybody's thinking

340
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:39,520
that. So just remember as the rule, the bigger the population, usually not a hundred percent time,

341
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:46,400
but most of the time there's more competition. Okay. So what I try to do is I try to find the,

342
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:53,840
the cities with the least population that still have adequate search for the least population.

343
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:59,120
And I've found some really small cities. I have a specific project in a city of 30,000 people.

344
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:03,680
And this thing, it doesn't make me a ton of money. It makes me like, I think like six or seven

345
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:07,280
hundred bucks a month, but guys, I don't even think I put a backlink on it. I think we just

346
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:13,680
threw up a website. We rank number one, throw up a GMB, boom, done. And that thing just been

347
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:18,480
churning out 600 bucks a month for two, three years. Okay. Has enough search volume to get me

348
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:23,680
that six, seven hundred bucks a month, but it took almost no work. Literally I just built a website

349
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:28,000
and it's up there. It's done. We're good. Okay. So the bigger the population, usually the more

350
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:36,080
competition next. Okay. Another rule that I live by another law principle I live by is do not

351
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:42,240
run away. Do not let me say, do not immediately run away when you see another lead gen site.

352
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:49,360
Do not run away when you immediately see another lead gen site. Guys, in the beginning of my

353
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,680
rank and rank career, I, as soon as I saw another lead gen site and you guys know what they look

354
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:59,200
like, they had the quote form and they look kind of bad, kind of terrible. We have like, we're not

355
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,600
designers. We're, we like money, right? We had terrible looking websites. That's why I always

356
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:08,880
make fun of my websites on my, on my shorts and my posts and stuff. You know, when you see a lead

357
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:14,160
gen site typically, right? It's a generic name, blah, blah, blah. I used to be somebody as soon

358
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:19,440
as I saw a lead gen site, I was out. I was like, no, I'm not going to mess with it. And I was like,

359
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,960
gosh dang it, I should have got here earlier. And sometimes I'd even like go down and I look at the

360
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,680
who is I'm like, and I'd find that person in there in my group. And I was like, gosh dude, I hate.

361
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:32,240
And I occasionally, I even tried to reach out and buy those, these websites, these people just

362
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:39,200
never worked out. And I like, just turned me away. And then I had an experience and I was in my own

363
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:44,320
backyard. I was in St. George, Utah. And I was looking at tree service, right? It was when I was

364
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:54,560
scaling tree service in 2020. Sorry. Yeah. 2020. And I did the research and everything looked good.

365
00:31:54,560 --> 00:32:01,840
Wasn't super competitive, but I saw another lead gen site. Okay. So I clear as day, another lead

366
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:06,960
gen site. And I was just this close to just like being like, I'm not going to do it. And then I was

367
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:11,520
like, you know what, maybe I'll just reach out. And I found out who it was. Sure enough, they were in

368
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:16,080
one of my other groups, following the same training and whatever. And I was pissed. And I was like,

369
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,200
you know what, I'm just going to reach out because I know who it is. I found them on Facebook. I'm

370
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:24,240
like, Hey, are you interested in selling your tree service site in St. George? Just so you know,

371
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:31,120
I live here. And they couldn't have been more rude. Not only were they not interested in selling

372
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,480
me the site, but they were not interested in even having a conversation. They were not even

373
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:40,320
interested in being an acquaintance of mine. They just felt me like to be a threat. And honestly,

374
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:46,800
what happened is that pissed me off so bad. It really, really pissed me off that they like treated

375
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:50,880
me like that, that I did it in spite of that. I literally did it in spite. I was like, okay,

376
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:57,360
game on, game on. They were like number two. I was like, I'm going to be number one. And out of spite

377
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:02,640
for this person, I went ahead and went into the city and built a website,

378
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:10,800
got a client and had one of my best clients. I signed this person in 2020 March. I still remember

379
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:18,640
it was like mid-March, right in the middle of COVID on the hood of their truck in a gas station

380
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:23,760
parking lot. I swear to you, this is a true story. We had talked on Zoom earlier and then she had to

381
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:28,080
talk to her husband or vice versa. No, I met him at a coffee shop. She talked to me. I swear to

382
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:32,960
you, we met at a gas station and we signed a physical contract for the first month in March

383
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:37,120
2020. It was one of my best clients ever. And they stayed with me for a long time. They eventually

384
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:42,800
went on to do their own stuff like a few months ago, but they kind of outgrew what I was doing.

385
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:49,680
They wanted to just expand. But literally, I would have missed out on, I think I made, what was that,

386
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:54,320
over $20,000 because I almost ran away. Okay. So what you guys have to remember

387
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:59,360
is just because you see another lead gen site, don't assume that that website's getting leads.

388
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,680
Number one. Okay. What I mean by that is like, just because you see another lead gen site,

389
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:07,680
doesn't necessarily mean you should go into that city. It doesn't mean they are getting leads. So

390
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,480
it doesn't mean that like, yeah, that's a guaranteed, you should go to that city. Number

391
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:17,200
two, don't assume because you see a lead gen site that they have a client. In fact, most of the

392
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:22,400
time I would be like, pretty much assume they don't have a client. And that was the case in

393
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:28,720
St. George tree service. I actually called the website or I requested for a quote and nobody

394
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:33,360
answered. And then I did it like two or three times, nobody got back to me. And that's why I

395
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:38,480
was like, let me reach out to these people. Don't assume they have a client. Okay. What you guys,

396
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,480
and some of you guys might be in other programs, look at our free Facebook group. We have 6,000

397
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:48,160
members. Do you know that in over half of the people in that group, in our free Facebook group

398
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:52,000
have already learned the skillset of building a website and getting leads. They're probably in

399
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,320
one or most of them are probably in, most of you guys are probably in one to two other groups.

400
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,280
And the problem is, is just because you could build a website, just because you can get leads,

401
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,760
does that mean you're going to make money? Guys don't assume because someone has a ranking website

402
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:09,520
that they are working with a client. Okay. And thirdly, do not assume that two people

403
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:14,320
cannot have two different clients in the same city. Even if they do have a client,

404
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,440
why can't you work with Bob and I work with Joe?

405
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:25,760
You can, it doesn't matter. It's just another website. We get so scared. We think that,

406
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:30,640
who cares? What I do is if I see another lead generator, I just take that website and I view

407
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:35,120
it just like any other website. I pretend it's Bob, the freaking concrete guy. And I look at

408
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:38,880
his backlinks and I look at the age of his domain and I look at his content and I look

409
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:43,200
how his website structured and I look at his GMB and I assess it just like it was Bob.

410
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:50,240
That's it. And if it still works, if the numbers, if the competition is still low

411
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:54,320
and the search volume is still there and everything else checks, dude, I'm going into it.

412
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:58,800
I could care less or I couldn't care less. I think I couldn't care less how you say it.

413
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,000
Okay. Don't immediately run away when you see another lead generator site.

414
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:08,080
Okay. I got one more. Try to, this is my last one and I actually have a bonus one really quick.

415
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:16,160
Try to find areas that are growing rapidly statistically. Try to find areas that are

416
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,520
growing rapidly statistically or that are statistically growing rapidly. I don't know

417
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:25,680
how the best way to say that English is. Okay. And I'm telling you this because if you know of

418
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:32,000
areas that are growing rapidly, whether it's because of data you've seen, family members

419
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:38,560
that live in those areas, you've traveled there for other jobs or vacation, knowing this information

420
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:44,960
about cities will allow you to look at cities and confidently go into cities you never would have

421
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,560
confidently gone into before. Even when everything else doesn't look so perfect.

422
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,360
Okay. Let me give you two examples. Number one example is Bentonville, Arkansas.

423
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:58,800
I lived in Bentonville, Arkansas, selling door to door home security systems. I saw how many houses

424
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:04,640
were being built. I saw the construction companies. I saw how many families were moving into

425
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,160
Bentonville, Arkansas. And I knew that the reason they were moving into Bentonville, Arkansas

426
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:13,120
is because Walmart was headquartered there. And Walmart had a policy that if you want to sell to

427
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:20,240
Walmart, you needed to have a office in Bentonville, Arkansas. Who knows about where? Bentonville,

428
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:24,880
Arkansas, you need to have an office there. They're that big. They can demand an office.

429
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:29,440
And so I was like, okay, Walmart's not going anywhere. And the guy that works for Jack

430
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:34,240
links lives over there. And the guy that works for Pepsi lives over there. And the guy that

431
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:38,800
does this. And I was like, this place is just going to keep growing. And I statistically

432
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:43,920
was looking at some of the data with how it grew. And I was asking people, what was the recession

433
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:48,400
like? They're like, dude, we didn't even feel it. And I saw just new construction after new

434
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:53,600
construction. And I knew, because I spent time there, this place was going to explode and continue

435
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:58,880
to grow. And it's continued to explode. Okay. And when I did the research on this area,

436
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:04,080
the numbers weren't perfect. They weren't so good that I was just thrilled. I might have even

437
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:07,360
skipped it. First of all, I wouldn't have even looked at it. Second of all, I probably would have

438
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:13,760
skipped it if I hadn't have lived there or known about it. And, but because I knew about it, guys,

439
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,800
I went in and build a website. You guys know, I've talked about some of that Bentonville

440
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:22,640
concrete.com. And that site has made me so much money. It was so easy to rank. It was like the

441
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:29,120
most perfect golden website ever. But one of the biggest reasons, because I had information,

442
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:34,080
this was actually like first-hand information, that this city was rapidly growing. Okay. Another

443
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:38,960
example of St. George, Utah, ironically, where I live, I, it's the same type of thing that the

444
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:45,040
city is just exploding. The population when I built St. George tree service was not that great.

445
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:50,160
And I was like, no, man. In fact, I avoided my own city for a long time, because I was like,

446
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:54,320
everybody's cheap and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I don't want to sell the people that I know.

447
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:58,400
And I was like, you're being an idiot, Nick. And in 2020, I built like three, four websites

448
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:02,400
that made me over a thousand dollars a month each in my own backyard. And at one point,

449
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:09,600
I think we were doing like close to $10,000 a month in my own backyard from niches in my own

450
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:14,400
backyard, but that I'd completely skipped. But I finally was like, dude, look at all the growth,

451
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,920
look at all the houses, look at all the construction companies, look at wherever all that.

452
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:22,560
And it just was like, duh, you're such an idiot, Nick. Okay. Try to find areas that are rapidly

453
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:26,720
growing. Okay. And if you can get statistics, great. If you know first-hand information from

454
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:30,800
family members, friends traveling there, or you've been there yourself, even better. Okay.

455
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:37,520
My bonus tip, my bonus rule. Okay. And this is something that like doesn't have to be checked,

456
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:43,760
but it's, it helps a lot. That's why I want to give it to you guys is knowing the demographic

457
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,520
and the area. Okay. Which kind of goes hand in hand a little bit with what I just said,

458
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:53,520
but if you guys can know a little bit about the people that live there, right? A little bit about

459
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:57,600
the people. I'm a, I'm a big believer that humans are humans are humans. Meaning that like, if I,

460
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:07,040
you know, like, for example, humans, what's a good example? Like for, like if I'm somebody in Utah

461
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:14,320
that likes groceries delivered to my house, it's pretty likely that you living in Connecticut,

462
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:17,520
you also like groceries delivered to your house because you don't want to go to the grocery store

463
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:22,320
and waste your time and potentially get, you know, sick or whatever the case is, right?

464
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:28,560
Humans are humans are humans. However, I have learned that from state to state, city to city,

465
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:35,760
definitely country to country, there are nuances. And the more you know, the better decisions you're

466
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:42,080
going to make. And let me give you an example. In bed in Northwest Arkansas, there's a city called

467
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:48,400
Bentonville. I just talked about an hour and a half, maybe two hours south. There's a city called

468
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:57,120
Fort Smith. Okay. Just, I think about two hours. I've been there a few times. And I will tell you

469
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:04,800
that the, the difference in the people is so, is so different. It is, they're still from Arkansas.

470
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:10,080
They're still a Southern ish. I'd call them more Midwestern, but technically we say Arkansas

471
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:15,760
Southern. But guys, for some reason, people that live in Fort Smith have this old school mentality.

472
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:20,800
It's good old boy. We only do business with people that we know. And when we want to do business,

473
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,720
we ask for referrals and that's it. And we don't want anyone new in our town. And if you come into

474
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:28,880
my town, I'm not that interested in talking to you. That's how the mentality is. It's two hours away

475
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:33,840
from Bentonville. And guess what? In Bentonville, no one's from Bentonville. No one, everyone's from

476
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:39,360
somewhere else. And they're, they've been implanted because of work. Another example,

477
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:45,360
St. George, Utah, where I live. Okay. Tons of people moving in, but in my cul-de-sac,

478
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:50,240
where I have a house, my next door neighbors from Northern Utah. So they're from same state,

479
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:54,400
but like four hours away. Then the other two people in my cul-de-sac, one from Texas,

480
00:41:54,400 --> 00:42:01,280
one from California. Okay. Like everyone's from not there. Like, and I'm not from that city either.

481
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:05,360
I'm from Utah, but I'm not from that city. Everyone's moved there for work opportunities,

482
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:10,640
for the weather, for recreation, whatever. And because I knew that I'm like, okay, confidently,

483
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:16,960
I know that if people are from California or people are from Texas, you know, they're probably

484
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:20,320
going to be more likely to spend money. One thing I know about people from Utah, because I've lived

485
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:26,960
there, is that in small towns in Utah, people are very cheap. People would say, do anything to save

486
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:32,000
$5. I swear to you, they would drive across town, not thinking they're going to spend $15 in gas

487
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:36,880
to go to get a $5 coupon redeemed. And I swear to you, I'm not making that up. If any of you guys

488
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:41,760
on the stream that are from Utah, you guys can verify what I'm saying. So I knew that the city

489
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:46,480
that I lived in, St. George, wasn't really Utah people. It was mainly like people from out of state.

490
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:52,000
45 minutes up the road, there's a little city called Cedar City, Utah, which I went to college

491
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,880
in for two years. And that place is basically only people from Cedar City. And guess what?

492
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:04,720
No one wants to spend money. You want to charge what to pour my concrete? Nah, dude, I'll just go

493
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:11,840
get the bags at whatever and get people from my church to come help me. You want to pay for moving?

494
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:15,920
I'm not paying for moving services. I'm certainly not going to have you pressure wash my driveway.

495
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:20,400
I'll just go buy a pressure washer. I'll do it myself. Like, this is the mentality of these

496
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:25,680
people that are 45 minutes away from the city of St. George in a city called Cedar City.

497
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:31,200
It's insane. And so the hard part is, if you don't live in those areas, you don't know that.

498
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:37,280
But when you know that, it changes the entire game. So you have to remember, the more information you

499
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:41,120
can get on these cities, the more information you can get when you call business owners. Because when

500
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:47,120
you're calling business owners, Nick notes, how did that one act? Oh, that one acted like he didn't

501
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:51,040
even want to talk to me, like I had a disease. And then the next three were the same. Okay,

502
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:56,800
maybe there's something there. Right. So guys, just remember that knowing the area and the

503
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:02,000
demographic people does matter. Okay. So let me give this quick recap on these different laws

504
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,160
of picking the perfect city. And then I'm going to go into Q&A. So number one is population does

505
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,840
not matter. Number two is if you could see it on a map, then it's probably not going to be worth

506
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:17,280
your time. Number three, certain states suck, namely California and New Jersey. Number four,

507
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:22,000
weather and seasonality do matter. Stay out of places that are extremely cold if you can.

508
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:29,040
Number five, bigger population usually equals bigger competition. Number six, don't immediately

509
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:34,560
run away when you see another Legion site. Number seven, try to find areas that are growing

510
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:38,880
rapidly. And then my bonus tip is the more you know about the area, the more you know about the

511
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:45,200
demographics, the better decisions you're going to make. Guys, these are things that I have learned

512
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:48,400
because I have literally looked at a thousand locations. I've gone into

513
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:56,160
hundreds of the wrong cities, hundreds. And I mean that like we had well over 200 websites at one

514
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:02,640
point in inside of my business, in all different cities, in all different niches. And we made our

515
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:09,920
million dollars off of like 40 websites. Yeah. So you guys have to realize that like all these

516
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:13,360
people that are giving you advice, build, build, build, build, build, build, build, build, build,

517
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:19,120
most these guys are selling you tools to build. Most of you guys, most of those guys are making

518
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:23,760
money because you are building more websites, right? I'm not selling you tracking numbers.

519
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:27,840
I'm not selling you websites. I'm not selling you hosting. I'm not selling you that stuff.

520
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:33,120
I don't. And that's not how I roll. I want to build a website that's going to work. I want to go.

521
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:37,680
I want to run ads. I want to get the deal. And I want to be a sniper. I don't want to take a

522
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:43,600
shotgun and just shoot bullets. That's messy, right? It's just some heavy cleanup. I want to

523
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:49,200
be a sniper. And if I decide to go into that city, it's one shot, one kill. I know what's

524
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:52,480
going to happen. I'm most likely going to get that deal. I know I'm going to get that deal.

525
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:56,000
I'm going to build a website and I'm going to have a really clean business. I'm not just throwing

526
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:01,040
stuff at the wall, hoping to see what sticks. Okay. So that said, guys, who has questions?

527
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:04,160
Let me see if there's anything in the comments. We got some stuff in the chat.

528
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:09,920
Here we go. So just for the sake of time, I'm going to go ahead and just read through these

529
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:12,400
in the future. I'll try to leave more time. We can have you guys come on live. So

530
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:21,040
Jay says he's in Jersey. Jay, prove me wrong, but I promise you Jersey. I don't know what it is,

531
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:26,720
man. It's a weird state. Okay. Kirk says, I'm not sure what you mean by relative to competition.

532
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,600
Can you give an example? So what I mean by that is like,

533
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:34,960
so let me read your entire comment to make sure I know exactly. I'm not sure what you mean by

534
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:39,840
relative to competition. Can you give an example? E.g. volume 50, then what would too much competition

535
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:44,880
look like for that volume and location? So that, again, as I said in the beginning,

536
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:48,960
we're not going to be able to cover all of that in this 40 minutes. That's part of what we talk

537
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:54,400
about, our formula for picking a perfect city in terms of competition. We're just talking about

538
00:46:55,360 --> 00:47:01,600
about like my rules of picking the perfect city. But what I mean by that is like, you want to get

539
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:09,040
into a city. What matters is having enough search volume while still having low competition. And

540
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:14,320
what I mean by low competition, guys, is the ability to rank your website. Right? If you look

541
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:18,320
at Las Vegas, Nevada, tree service, there's probably going to be a ton of search volume,

542
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:23,840
but it's also going to be a lot of competition. Okay. If you look at Las Vegas, Nevada,

543
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:26,320
tree service is going to be a lot of search volume. There's going to be a lot of competition.

544
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:32,560
Right. We want to go into cities that have good search volume. They're probably not going to be

545
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:37,760
as high as Vegas, but there's almost no competition. That's the sweet spot. Right.

546
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:43,680
That's what I call a layup. Hopefully that makes sense. And again, to answer that specific question,

547
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:47,440
the like the volume and all that stuff, that's something that we that's like, it's a much

548
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:52,640
heavier question that we cover in more depth in inside of our thing. But Mark,

549
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:59,440
what's your take on a town of 40,000 with search volumes of 10? So the tricky part of the search

550
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:05,360
volume thing, we're going back to like also what Kirk said, is it depends on the tool you're using.

551
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:10,400
Right. Because I don't know what tool you're using and you what, basically I'll give you like the

552
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:15,600
overview with, with tools, they're all wrong. Like nothing's accurate period, just so you know,

553
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:19,520
like nothing's accurate. All you're doing with tools is you're finding benchmarks. You're finding

554
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:26,080
out like how, okay. You know, Bentonville, Arkansas, concrete, I'm ranking number one

555
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:30,880
for all these keywords and I get 30 leads per month for the last two years. Okay. Boom. So

556
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:36,640
how much, what does that tool say about Bentonville concrete? Well, it says that there's only

557
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:42,400
50, sorry, it says there's 15 searches. Well, that's not true because I'm getting 30 leads.

558
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:47,600
Right. So then I can safely assume that if the tool says 15, it's probably double. Right. So you

559
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:51,840
kind of have to find a benchmark and go off that. So I can't answer that question based on that data,

560
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:57,840
but what I would tell you is like 40,000 is on the lower end and 10, no matter what tool you're

561
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:02,960
using seems low. The other thing you have to consider, which I probably would add, I would

562
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:07,760
definitely add into this, but I don't, I don't want to get too much into weeds because that's stuff

563
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:12,800
that I cover when you have to have the full picture is you need to know what the CPC is

564
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:17,280
because if it's, if it's a search volume of 10 and there's zero cost per click,

565
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,640
then that probably means no one even wants that traffic.

566
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,640
And I don't know if that makes any sense to you, but I can go into that in more depth, but yeah,

567
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:28,320
that's going to be too hard to answer. I would say just my gut tells me that's not enough

568
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:34,480
volume. You got to have adequate search volume. Guy Prantz, same thing. You guys are asking really

569
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:38,800
good questions. This is one of those things like, again, that it's tough to answer unless

570
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:44,160
you know exactly the entire process. So adequate search volume basically means taking a website

571
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:48,800
that you know for a fact is ranking really well, looking at the numbers of that in terms of how

572
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:54,080
many calls it's getting, comparing that with the tool you're using and using that as a benchmark.

573
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:58,640
And you have to do that repeatedly. You have to do that because the tools change, the search volume

574
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:02,800
changes, and you kind of constantly have to be doing that. And so, and at the end of the day,

575
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:09,120
it's not entirely a science. It's more of an art. And by doing this a thousand times,

576
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:13,760
you kind of recognize these patterns. Okay. Laura says definitely done that.

577
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:18,560
Kirk, how do I benchmark a niche location when I don't have a site there? You guys can use,

578
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:26,720
if you want to ask this question, Kirk, inside of the free group, you can ask this question.

579
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:32,880
Like you go make a post, and then Aaron, I'll have you remind me to look at the data on,

580
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:37,040
we could say Bentonville concrete, and I can kind of give you a city that's ranking really well,

581
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:43,200
and you could use that to benchmark if you guys want. Okay. Howard says, does median income

582
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:47,360
matter? If so, what's the average income threshold you're aiming for? I think it's a factor. To be

583
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:53,280
honest, I've never really looked at it. I just know like certain states are like usually not

584
00:50:53,280 --> 00:51:00,000
as well to do. Like I know Mississippi is a very poor state, just statistically. And so I've,

585
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,760
in fact, I've only done one website in, I think, was it, no, that's in Louisiana.

586
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:08,480
Maybe I haven't done anything in Mississippi. I just kind of stay out of states that are like,

587
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:15,920
it sounds bad, but like, I don't have to go into Mississippi. I can be that way. I don't have to

588
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:20,400
go in there. I can, whatever. So it does matter. I've never really like looked at it too much. I

589
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:27,840
think it's more about just like, I don't think you need to worry that much about it, but as a

590
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:31,920
state, if it has like kind of a stigma as being a poor state, I probably would avoid it. Okay.

591
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:37,440
Jay says, so should I just start in Bentonville? You can. You definitely can. And guys,

592
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:43,200
funny thing is I'm so not the person that gives a flying you know what about like,

593
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:46,960
guys, I'm telling you guys which cities I'm in. I'm not hiding anything. I'm telling you the

594
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:52,480
niches. I know I'm telling you the web. Like I have videos on, on YouTube. You guys could see

595
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:56,160
website examples. And the reason I do that is because if I'm taking care of my client,

596
00:51:56,160 --> 00:52:00,080
I shouldn't have to worry, right? It's like being married to someone and being worried that like,

597
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:04,480
if you introduce them to your handsome friend, she's going to leave you. That's the wrong person to

598
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:09,120
be married to, or you're not, you're not bringing, you're not pulling your weight. So I don't worry

599
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:13,200
about that stuff. So I'm, yeah. So basically, Jay, if you want to go to Bentonville, dude, check it

600
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:17,040
out. It's a great city. St. George, Utah is a great city. Queen Creek, Arizona. I'll share that

601
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:21,040
with you. These are great cities. They're growing. You can also do a Google search and type in like

602
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:26,400
fastest growing cities for the last five years in the U.S. and get the same thing. So, you know,

603
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,560
but keep in mind if it's Bentonville, I probably looked at it as well.

604
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:33,040
Jason, you're 100% New Jersey is highly competitive and saturated. Very difficult.

605
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:39,440
Interesting. Beautiful. Guys, thank you for being on. I appreciate you guys being on. I love this.

606
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:42,640
I don't know even how many we ended up having on, but let me see. We got Paul,

607
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:50,000
Mark, Ferranc, Lara. What I want to do, Aaron, can you hear me still? Hop on really quick before

608
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:56,640
you guys hop off. So what we're going to do guys is Aaron's going to, he's been on this call. He's

609
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:02,560
going to create just like a simple, like PDF with these rules, like a really like nice looking clean

610
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:09,440
PDF. And anyone that was on this live, I'm trying to think how we could, what you're going to do,

611
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:13,760
Aaron, can you like screenshot everyone that was on this live somehow? And I want you to

612
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:17,760
send this to them. So if you guys were on this, just because I appreciate you guys staying on

613
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:23,440
to the end, if you're on here right now, then Aaron will DM you from the Donnie Dre. We tried

614
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:27,600
to do that so Aaron doesn't have to be inundated with messages on his private one. He's going to

615
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:34,640
email you like a nice looking like document with all the stuff I went over today. So if you guys

616
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:40,480
were on there, stay on. Did you screenshot it yet, Aaron? Yeah, you're good. Okay. Last question

617
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:45,600
I'll answer really quick is, is the search volume good enough if the Google ad forecast shows 84

618
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:51,280
clicks with a budget of $20 a day? I don't look at that metric and I never have, so I couldn't. I

619
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:58,560
look at the search volume versus the CPC versus the competition. And again, the competition thing

620
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:04,720
is kind of one of those formulas that we teach, that I teach inside of my program, but I could

621
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:09,280
cover it in more detail. Again, I want to give you guys as much as possible. It's kind of like

622
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:13,120
the free leads thing. Like I want to give you guys, I want you guys to be able to take what you

623
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:16,160
learned today and be able to get started, right? Just like we don't want to give our business

624
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:20,560
owners leads and, well, here's some leads, but I hope you don't make money, right? That's stupid.

625
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:24,000
I want you guys to take this. If you guys make money from what I teach you today,

626
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:30,320
you'll be back next time. So amazing questions, guys. Appreciate you guys being on and we'll be

627
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:34,160
doing these every single week. So keep an eye on the Facebook group and we've got some other stuff

628
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:37,200
coming up this week as well. So thanks guys. I'm out.
