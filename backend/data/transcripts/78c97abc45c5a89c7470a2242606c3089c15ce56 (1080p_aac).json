{"text": " I've had like, six, yeah, six cities now I've done concrete in Florida. Okay. And all the DD the search volume checked out. I mean, like, you know, when you search on SEM rush, you get like the main number on the bottom left, you have related keywords. I mean, add all those up. I mean, there were it was like 100 200 300 searches a month, right? So like, the search volumes there, but it was getting no impressions after like eight or nine days. So I just went ahead and pause those. But um, and I took the number off a call rail, so I wasn't paying for it. I don't know if that does anything for like future payments anyway. Um, my question is, do you go back and test those cities again? Maybe like two weeks down the road, because maybe like the first time around for for whatever reason, there was like a glitch in the algorithm or something happened. And like the second time around, like it actually performed really well for you. I don't make no sense for those cities not to be getting zero impressions or two impressions, three impressions, you know? Yeah, I definitely will test them out. I'll circle back on everything. I don't do it two weeks later, though, like I'll wait a couple months. Okay, because I think it just my head, I'm always like, I wonder if it has to do because I know, like on paper, where, you know, you're really close to me. I'm in, I'm in St. George in Vegas, we're basically like, it's 70 out there. And so I think, like, and I know what the weather is like in Florida, but also, I, so I'm always like, let's, let's like, wait till the next season and try it. So I'll pause and unpause shit. Because, and that's the same way I and I do that. Because when I used to sell door to door, there would be neighborhoods that I would give up on, I'd go, I'd knock the doors, and I had a bunch of freaking douchebags. I'm like, oh, I screw this neighborhood, I'm never coming back. But then like a couple months later, I'm like, now I'm going to go back in there. And then I would get that first deal. And all of a sudden, I would blow that neighborhood up. And I'm like, okay, I'm glad I didn't give up on that. So I always serve you guys, I did a training, like way back when my mood was in town, on just working your areas. And that's the same for projects, you guys have projects that like, you want to just pick and shit on them and like get rid of them and burn into the ground. Just relax, pause it, go get a deal. Get that momentum, come back and work on it. And the same with ads, pause it, if you get rid of your number, whatever, that's fine. And then just come back, you know, a couple months down the road. So I would definitely circle background, especially if like the CPC lines up, and their search volume and the whole deal, then I would just come back, I would definitely not give up on that would come back. Because if not, you could shoot them to me and I'll try them out. Yeah, I'm definitely gonna try them out again. Because like I said, everything is perfect. And these are cities that were like, in between Central Florida to like Tampa. So if you're familiar, you guys, so you got like Brandon Riverview, stuff like that 100,000 population. I mean, and I have I have a couple of sites, a few sites in Florida, like Gainesville, Ocala, you know, Palm Coast, St. Augustine on the East Coast, I have less population less search volume than those five did. Yeah, and they were they were getting leads and impressions left and right. Well, for those five or so, for whatever reason, they just weren't getting any impressions. Yeah, I don't know. Think about it like this. Yeah, I have a site called Cedar City concrete. I have a site Bentonville concrete, those are 30,000 population. And they're like they're getting 30 like Cedar City is only getting probably like 10 to 20. But Bentonville has been doing 30. There is concrete volume in every city. I don't care where you're at. There's always going to be some like at least 30,000 plus there's going to be concrete volume. So yeah, if it's if you're talking 100,000 population, all the metrics are there. Come back and hit it again.
