1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,780
Alright, so this part is very short, but it's really, really important that you do it.

2
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:16,180
The reason why is because you want to make sure that you are protected legally in the

3
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,860
future for your website.

4
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:26,600
And so we go to the very bottom, right here, where it says Side Power by Nick Wood, you're

5
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:31,040
going to click in this section that Weebly automatically creates for you.

6
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:36,640
So this is not a section that we made previously in our framing asset video.

7
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,000
This is something that is automatically created for you.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,440
So once you have created this, this is where we're going to add the terms of service for

9
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,840
your website, the privacy policy, and this is where you're going to add the fact that

10
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,880
you're affiliated to your client and you can also add, and it would suggest you're doing

11
00:00:53,880 --> 00:01:00,120
so to avoid any trouble, you're going to add the contractor license of your client

12
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,600
right here at the bottom.

13
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,160
So let's get it started.

14
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:09,880
You're going to drag the text right here, okay?

15
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,080
You're going to add another text right here.

16
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:20,920
Alright, and we like to use this free tool called Terms Feed that generates privacy policies

17
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,920
for you.

18
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,800
It's very simple.

19
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:30,640
So I already have this pulled up, you're going to search for app.termsfeed.com and it's going

20
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:36,760
to take you right here and we are going to generate the terms and conditions first.

21
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:46,280
So click on here, click on start, select website, okay, the URL is whatever we bought earlier

22
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,280
from GoDaddy.

23
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,880
So make sure you copy and paste that in here.

24
00:01:52,880 --> 00:02:01,680
The name of the website is in my case, Queen Creek Concrete, payment individual, oops,

25
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:13,280
individual, okay, enter, make sure the correct country is selected, select your state, no,

26
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:23,280
no, okay, this is going to be by visiting a page on our website, which again, put the

27
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:31,280
domain in here and the phone number is whatever you purchased on CallRail.

28
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,280
Let's see, hopefully I don't have to pull that back up for you.

29
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:59,280
Okay, your tracking number, so copy and paste it, next step, email address, so wherever

30
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:11,280
you want this privacy policy to be sent to, okay, generate and boom.

31
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:18,280
So you're going to copy this, now open a new tab, paste that in there, click search

32
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,280
and it's right here.

33
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:26,280
So copy this link again and you're going to, right at the bottom, you're going to type

34
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:42,280
terms and conditions, select all of it, insert a link, a website URL, you're going to paste

35
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:49,280
that same link, click out of it, reselect, let's bold it, underline it and let's make

36
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:55,280
it a color so people know that they can click on it, can make it red, perfect.

37
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:06,280
And now we are going to, let's align this, okay, actually delete the spacer right here

38
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,280
and again, make sure you add there, you're an affiliated company with your client and

39
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:22,280
put the license and contractor, okay, we're going to name this privacy policy, okay, back

40
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:30,280
to terms feed, so we can close this out, click on the logo, it should take you back to the

41
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:43,280
homepage, okay, perfect, privacy policy start, website, same thing, phone number, I would

42
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:48,280
just keep every tab open with everything that you need because these keep reoccurring and

43
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:54,280
you always need them so I would just leave it like it is, same as earlier, individual

44
00:04:54,280 --> 00:05:01,280
United States, make sure you're putting every information correctly, email first number,

45
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:16,280
first name and phone number, visiting, same, oops, that's fine, put that phone number,

46
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:33,280
next step, no, we just want the basic one and generate, oops, boom, copy this, same

47
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:40,280
thing as we did earlier, I do this just to double check it looks correctly, you copy,

48
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:49,280
go back to Weebly, select everything, link it to a website URL, click out of it, now

49
00:05:49,280 --> 00:06:06,280
we're going to make this bold, okay, now we're going to test it really quick, so click on

50
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:15,280
publish and that little footer is nice because it should copy automatically on every other

51
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:22,280
service page, so let's just pick a random one, it should be at the very bottom, perfect,

52
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:27,280
so we're just going to test it, click on both of them and make sure it takes you here and

53
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,280
you're done, that's all you need to do for that.
