WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:23.680
All right, we are live.

00:23.680 --> 00:24.680
Let's see.

00:24.680 --> 00:28.880
I think just want to make sure I can hear myself.

00:28.880 --> 00:46.800
All right, I don't think we have anyone on yet, but we're going to keep rolling along.

00:46.800 --> 00:52.720
All right, looks like we just got a couple of people that hopped on.

00:52.720 --> 00:55.680
Just so you know, Nick is going to be on in just a few minutes.

00:55.680 --> 00:58.000
He's on his way to the office.

00:58.640 --> 01:02.080
Don't worry, you're not stuck with me for the next hour.

01:03.600 --> 01:05.040
Can you guys let me know if you can hear me?

01:05.040 --> 01:09.920
I'm trying to get Facebook on my phone, but should be able to hear me.

01:12.080 --> 01:12.560
Let's see.

01:15.840 --> 01:17.520
All right, so see we got a couple people on.

01:17.520 --> 01:18.240
Can you guys hear me?

01:20.880 --> 01:24.560
Make sure I can't hear myself.

01:28.400 --> 01:30.320
Nick's going to be on in just a few minutes.

01:31.040 --> 01:32.720
He is on his way to the office.

01:32.720 --> 01:34.560
So just hang tight real quick.

01:35.920 --> 01:37.040
Thank you, Aaron Smith.

01:37.760 --> 01:38.960
Appreciate that, bro.

01:38.960 --> 01:39.920
Coming in loud and clear.

01:40.960 --> 01:41.520
All right.

01:41.520 --> 01:44.240
And dude, Aaron, I think, aren't you, didn't you just join?

01:44.240 --> 01:47.680
I think I saw your post on digital landlords.

01:47.680 --> 01:48.720
That's awesome, bro.

01:48.720 --> 01:50.240
I'm super excited to have you.

01:50.240 --> 01:54.560
How this normally works is Nick will just go live here at 7 a.m. MST.

01:55.360 --> 01:57.280
But again, he just asked me real quick to jump in

01:57.280 --> 02:00.720
because he's going to be a few minutes late on the way to the office.

02:00.720 --> 02:03.200
But we're going to get this thing rolling.

02:03.200 --> 02:04.320
It's going to be a fun topic.

02:05.360 --> 02:06.960
It's going to be talking about second money.

02:06.960 --> 02:09.760
And what's cool about that is some people might be like, well, I got a first.

02:10.720 --> 02:13.920
Let's see, Stephanie says there's no link.

02:16.720 --> 02:20.880
Stephanie, are you talking about our group message with like Kyle and fix it?

02:24.240 --> 02:26.320
Or I'm not sure what you mean by there's no link.

02:26.320 --> 02:28.560
I did message you, by the way, in our group chat.

02:28.560 --> 02:31.600
But Matthew says, I hear you, Aaron.

02:31.600 --> 02:32.400
Nice to be here.

02:33.120 --> 02:33.360
Yes.

02:33.360 --> 02:34.000
Thank you, Matthew.

02:34.000 --> 02:34.800
Nice to be here as well.

02:35.920 --> 02:39.200
I just sent Nick the zoom link, so we're going to get this thing rolling.

02:39.200 --> 02:41.040
And again, we're going to be talking about second money.

02:41.040 --> 02:45.680
And what's cool about second money is that even if you're still working on that first deal,

02:47.200 --> 02:50.240
anytime you're learning about sales or just like business principles

02:50.240 --> 02:52.000
or just pricing structure in general,

02:52.000 --> 02:57.120
it seems like can be so applicable to just every aspect of whatever stage you're in in business.

02:57.120 --> 02:59.840
So I'm looking forward to talking about it.

03:00.560 --> 03:02.240
And so we're getting a few more people on.

03:02.960 --> 03:06.000
Just as a quick recap, guys, Nick's going to be on in a few minutes.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.480
So hang tight with me real quick.

03:09.440 --> 03:11.360
And we're going to get this thing rolling.

03:11.920 --> 03:13.360
Let me check my messages from him.

03:15.280 --> 03:15.680
Awesome.

03:15.680 --> 03:18.160
He says he's going to be there in a few minutes.

03:18.160 --> 03:24.080
So while we're waiting, I don't want to have dead air.

03:24.080 --> 03:28.880
I can do a quick little story of the Daniel says good morning.

03:28.880 --> 03:30.000
Good morning, Daniel.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.280
Good to see you, brother.

03:31.280 --> 03:33.120
So again, we're just waiting for Nick right now.

03:33.120 --> 03:34.000
He's going to be on soon.

03:34.000 --> 03:38.080
But so as of right now, I don't have any active deals.

03:38.080 --> 03:40.000
That's like 100% on me.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.680
Like I've closed deals in the past.

03:41.680 --> 03:44.000
I've done a complete A to Z on my own.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
And then with winter, because it was in Michigan,

03:46.960 --> 03:48.800
and we had to put a pause on it.

03:48.800 --> 03:51.200
Anyway, that said, I've had deals.

03:51.200 --> 03:57.120
And looking back on it, it's so important to qualify your business owners

03:57.120 --> 03:58.720
because you can waste a lot of time.

04:00.320 --> 04:03.360
Oh, Stephanie says, I thought this was a Zoom, but I hear you.

04:03.360 --> 04:04.960
Yeah, I know this is just going to be the live.

04:04.960 --> 04:07.760
I mean, if Nick has time, I know we've done this in the past,

04:07.760 --> 04:11.120
but I'm like bring people on for Q&A, like onto the Zoom.

04:11.120 --> 04:12.560
So we can actually see.

04:12.560 --> 04:14.960
We'll probably be a little short on time today.

04:15.440 --> 04:18.800
We can even see about starting to do that at the end of each live call each week.

04:19.600 --> 04:23.520
Anyway, so what happened was when you're calling these business owners,

04:23.520 --> 04:27.040
I would usually come from the perspective or the mindset.

04:27.040 --> 04:28.480
I'm inconveniencing them.

04:28.480 --> 04:30.240
I'm asking them, please take my leads.

04:30.880 --> 04:32.800
And that's just the wrong way to approach it

04:32.800 --> 04:35.600
because we're the one who's actually delivering the value.

04:36.800 --> 04:40.480
And so this was like a year ago when I was still pretty insecure

04:40.480 --> 04:43.840
about all this stuff didn't like sales, that much didn't know what I was doing.

04:43.840 --> 04:46.480
I mean, I knew what I was doing, but just didn't have much experience.

04:46.480 --> 04:48.160
So I called this guy.

04:48.160 --> 04:49.920
It's his Hispanic dude, right?

04:49.920 --> 04:52.400
And he was like, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

04:52.400 --> 04:54.240
He was super excited as he should be.

04:54.240 --> 04:55.040
It's free leads.

04:55.600 --> 04:57.920
And so I don't ask him any questions though,

04:57.920 --> 05:00.320
because I'm afraid to lose the deal.

05:00.320 --> 05:04.000
I mean, looking back on it, it's absolutely ridiculous, right?

05:04.000 --> 05:07.120
You should be asking like, hey, man, I'm happy to give you a couple of free leads,

05:07.120 --> 05:09.760
but just to make sure I don't want to waste your time or my time.

05:09.760 --> 05:12.800
Can I ask a couple of quick questions just to make sure this is going to be a good fit, right?

05:13.440 --> 05:15.920
And so again, that's when it talks about the pullback, right?

05:15.920 --> 05:18.160
And so I'm just reliving this in my mind.

05:18.720 --> 05:21.520
Bottom line is I send this guy a couple of leads.

05:21.520 --> 05:23.120
We go to hop on the Zoom call.

05:23.120 --> 05:25.360
And by the way, for the few of you that just jumped on,

05:25.360 --> 05:26.560
Nick's going to be on in a few minutes.

05:26.560 --> 05:28.080
He's on his way to the office.

05:28.080 --> 05:30.640
Anyway, I've sent this guy a few concrete leads at this point, right?

05:30.640 --> 05:31.360
They're good leads.

05:31.360 --> 05:32.400
I've live transferred them.

05:33.040 --> 05:34.960
He goes, we have a Zoom call scheduled.

05:35.520 --> 05:36.880
I start the Zoom.

05:36.880 --> 05:38.000
I'm excited.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.440
I'm ready to do this thing.

05:39.440 --> 05:40.560
He doesn't show.

05:40.560 --> 05:41.360
I text him.

05:41.360 --> 05:42.320
I don't hear anything back.

05:42.800 --> 05:45.040
Few hours later, this was scheduled for the morning.

05:45.040 --> 05:46.800
He texts, sorry, bro.

05:46.800 --> 05:50.720
I was late at a party last night with my brother and I slept in.

05:50.720 --> 05:52.800
So that's a bit of a red flag, right?

05:52.800 --> 05:55.120
Anyway, like, okay, whatever.

05:55.120 --> 05:59.440
And I didn't like do anything to like do a pullback or whatever.

05:59.440 --> 06:01.520
I was just like totally getting walked all over.

06:01.520 --> 06:05.600
And I was like, okay, well, we can do it tomorrow or whatever when we schedule it.

06:05.600 --> 06:07.120
So we go to schedule it.

06:07.120 --> 06:10.560
And I had prefaced this when we, the day before, said, by the way, bro,

06:10.560 --> 06:13.680
if you could be at your desktop or laptop, that'd be great.

06:13.680 --> 06:17.360
In case I need to share my screen, it'll just help the call to go by faster, right?

06:17.920 --> 06:19.840
So he's like, oh yeah, that sounds great.

06:19.840 --> 06:21.440
So we have the scheduled Zoom call.

06:22.240 --> 06:28.240
The dude shows up on his phone at the park with his like younger girl, right?

06:30.240 --> 06:31.680
Let's see, I'm just checking the message from Nick.

06:31.680 --> 06:32.480
He's going to be on soon.

06:32.480 --> 06:37.840
So right then and there, I should have been like, dude, I should have done a pullback.

06:37.840 --> 06:40.320
And like, it doesn't look like you're like actually serious or whatever.

06:40.800 --> 06:43.040
We're here to do business or whatever, something, right?

06:43.040 --> 06:46.560
Because he just did exactly the opposite of what I asked him to do, right?

06:47.920 --> 06:50.240
Plus I need to share my screen, like that's a real thing.

06:50.240 --> 06:54.320
And so he goes, it's like, yeah, man, sorry, like just here.

06:54.320 --> 06:55.120
It's like, okay, whatever.

06:55.120 --> 06:56.880
So I just do the call, right?

06:57.520 --> 06:59.920
And I have no control of the sales process.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.680
He's just stringing me along the whole time, right?

07:02.560 --> 07:03.440
Go to find out.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.320
This is where prospecting qualifying comes in.

07:07.200 --> 07:10.400
The guy is, it was actually, it was crazy.

07:10.400 --> 07:13.760
I go to hop on, turns out he, he doesn't have a green card.

07:13.760 --> 07:15.040
So he's an illegal alien.

07:15.600 --> 07:17.920
And like, I was like 16 at this point.

07:17.920 --> 07:21.040
And so it was actually kind of funny because I was kind of like freaking out internally,

07:21.040 --> 07:24.800
like, oh my goodness, am I going to get in trouble for doing business with like whatever?

07:24.800 --> 07:26.400
Like, you know what I'm saying, right?

07:26.400 --> 07:30.800
And so bottom line is I just kind of looked past that still see if we can make something work.

07:30.800 --> 07:33.200
So I go to drop price and what do you know?

07:34.000 --> 07:35.440
Boom, he's out.

07:35.600 --> 07:37.360
I was going to charge like a thousand bucks a month.

07:37.360 --> 07:41.600
And we were getting like, if I remember, it was like at least 12 to 15 leads a month.

07:42.880 --> 07:43.840
What a nightmare.

07:45.120 --> 07:48.320
If I was one year younger, I probably would have started crying.

07:49.600 --> 07:52.320
And yes, Eman, that is the proper emoji for that.

07:52.320 --> 07:55.920
So the moral of the story is to qualify these people, right?

07:55.920 --> 07:57.360
Now there is a little trick.

07:57.360 --> 08:01.360
Like if you ask too many questions on the cold call, it does seem like you will lose them.

08:01.360 --> 08:04.720
But what I found to be helpful is that when you hop on the cold call,

08:05.440 --> 08:09.680
depending on where they're at, it can be helpful to send them one lead to just like,

08:09.680 --> 08:12.640
so you show you're legit and then they're interested in that and be like,

08:12.640 --> 08:14.720
hey man, I'm happy to send you a few more.

08:14.720 --> 08:19.040
But hey, let's hop on a quick like chat today or tomorrow or whatever.

08:19.040 --> 08:20.720
And just so we can learn more about each other, right?

08:21.280 --> 08:24.080
In case we just want to see if this is a good fit, right?

08:24.080 --> 08:26.080
So then you're giving them permission to learn more about you.

08:26.080 --> 08:29.120
That way they're not scared of like, who is this guy and have zero dollars.

08:29.120 --> 08:31.120
Like we can be transparent with them, right?

08:31.120 --> 08:32.640
And then vice versa, right?

08:32.640 --> 08:36.480
So, oh, Eman says, just call me E homie.

08:37.920 --> 08:38.800
Thanks, bro.

08:38.800 --> 08:40.000
Appreciate it, Eve.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.520
Um, yeah, dude.

08:41.520 --> 08:44.400
Um, anyway, so let's see.

08:45.120 --> 08:48.560
Like it's a few minutes late, but anyway, that's it guys.

08:49.200 --> 08:50.000
Qualify these people.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.760
We're the ones who bringing, like we are looking for a win-win partnership, right?

08:54.640 --> 08:57.520
But we're the ones who are bringing the value to the table, right?

08:57.520 --> 09:01.200
And so it's really important not to get walked over by these business owners.

09:01.200 --> 09:03.280
I've lost a lot of deals from that.

09:03.920 --> 09:06.560
It's taken me a lot than that.

09:06.560 --> 09:06.880
Yeah.

09:06.880 --> 09:09.040
Anyway, so prospecting is a really big one.

09:09.040 --> 09:11.840
And I guess the biggest thing is like, just don't be scared to lose the deal.

09:11.840 --> 09:13.040
Number one, you probably won't.

09:13.040 --> 09:15.600
Number two, if you do, they probably aren't a good fit anyway.

09:16.240 --> 09:20.000
As long as obviously you don't be like super like interrogation style with it.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.920
But Jason, good morning.

09:21.920 --> 09:22.960
Glad to have you here, bro.

09:23.680 --> 09:24.240
Let's see.

09:24.240 --> 09:26.720
Nick should be on moment Tito.

09:28.400 --> 09:29.440
Sorry about this guys.

09:30.400 --> 09:32.640
Oh, thanks, Mahmood.

09:32.640 --> 09:33.360
Yeah, man.

09:33.360 --> 09:35.840
Um, hope that call goes well, bro.

09:35.840 --> 09:37.680
If you put in reps, I know you're crushing it.

09:37.680 --> 09:40.080
That's really cool to see all the lives you're doing in the group.

09:42.560 --> 09:45.840
So, yeah, that was probably like the worst sales experience.

09:45.840 --> 09:48.880
Um, yeah, that was pretty crazy.

09:48.880 --> 09:51.840
Um, all right.

09:51.840 --> 09:58.560
So, okay, well, may as well.

09:58.560 --> 10:01.680
May as well relive another sales story.

10:01.680 --> 10:04.560
And what's really cool about this though, guys, is when we look at the sales process,

10:05.360 --> 10:09.040
obviously when, when dealing with people, there's always variables, right?

10:09.040 --> 10:12.960
Just with responses and this or that or triggers or whatever.

10:12.960 --> 10:13.760
Right.

10:13.760 --> 10:17.120
But there is like when Jordan, love him or hate him.

10:17.120 --> 10:20.880
When Jordan Belfort says like every sale is the same, there is a truth to that.

10:20.880 --> 10:21.040
Right.

10:21.040 --> 10:25.440
Like when we look at the sales process that we have, it is a straight line.

10:25.440 --> 10:25.680
Right.

10:25.680 --> 10:28.160
And so all we gotta do is like check these boxes.

10:28.720 --> 10:32.400
And it is really like, think talks about in the modules, baking the cake.

10:32.400 --> 10:36.960
When we add these ingredients, 99% of the time, we should get a cake out the other side.

10:36.960 --> 10:37.360
Right.

10:37.360 --> 10:41.760
And so what's really cool about that is usually in sales, it can feel super overwhelming.

10:41.760 --> 10:46.480
But for us, all we gotta do is just make enough cold calls to get someone on the hook.

10:46.480 --> 10:47.280
Right.

10:47.280 --> 10:52.160
All we gotta do is just live transfer enough leads to get them ready for the zoom call.

10:52.160 --> 10:54.080
And then all we gotta do is the zoom call.

10:54.080 --> 10:56.080
It really is like a three-step sales process.

10:56.080 --> 10:56.320
Right.

10:56.320 --> 10:59.040
It is the prospecting, the setup, and the close.

10:59.040 --> 11:04.400
And so what's so cool about that is some of us are better than others at different parts.

11:04.400 --> 11:07.680
Like I was really bad at all three.

11:07.680 --> 11:09.280
I've gotten a little better at the closing.

11:09.280 --> 11:11.520
But I still need to get better at the prospecting and the setup.

11:11.520 --> 11:11.760
Right.

11:11.760 --> 11:15.120
And qualifying these business owners and just not getting so nervous and all that.

11:15.120 --> 11:15.680
Right.

11:15.680 --> 11:20.640
But what's so cool about that is once we check off all the boxes, that's when it does become

11:20.640 --> 11:21.520
a machine.

11:21.520 --> 11:22.000
Right.

11:22.000 --> 11:25.360
And that's when we can put in the certain inputs to get the outputs.

11:25.360 --> 11:27.440
And that's when we can predictably grow our business.

11:27.440 --> 11:27.920
Right.

11:27.920 --> 11:29.520
So that's the state I'm in right now.

11:29.520 --> 11:33.440
And by the way, for the few of you that just hopped on, Nick's gonna be on any minute.

11:33.440 --> 11:34.400
Hang tight.

11:34.400 --> 11:35.840
I have texted him the zoom link.

11:36.800 --> 11:37.760
He's gonna be on soon.

11:37.760 --> 11:40.320
So anyway, it's funny.

11:40.320 --> 11:44.800
Like a lot of the, it seems like with this group, the main issues isn't, most people

11:44.800 --> 11:46.400
struggle with the sales in this business.

11:46.400 --> 11:47.040
Right.

11:47.040 --> 11:50.000
Like so many people know how to rank a website or get leads.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.440
But a lot of people just struggle with converting that to specifically flat fee deals.

11:53.440 --> 11:54.880
Because that's really where you scale.

11:54.960 --> 11:58.160
I mean, you can make money with commission and pay per lead, but there's just so much

11:58.160 --> 11:59.200
maintenance per client.

11:59.200 --> 12:01.600
It's really not, it's really difficult to scale that way.

12:02.240 --> 12:05.200
But I was going to say the biggest issues, it seems like even me personally is just on

12:05.200 --> 12:08.800
the tech side with getting Google ad set, getting the due diligence, which is actually

12:08.800 --> 12:13.040
kind of cool to some degree, because once we get those things dialed in, then for our

12:13.040 --> 12:18.320
personal agencies, it is just so much easier to scale because we have just the sales process

12:18.320 --> 12:19.040
works.

12:19.040 --> 12:19.600
Right.

12:19.600 --> 12:22.480
And so I'm excited to be getting back into things.

12:22.480 --> 12:25.360
I actually got another lead yesterday for my ad campaign.

12:25.360 --> 12:27.360
So I need to be live transferring that over.

12:27.920 --> 12:30.000
And so yeah, guys, it's a good business.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.720
Like I was actually on a zoom with Jason Oliver the other day.

12:32.720 --> 12:36.880
And it seems like a helpful perspective when looking at this is to look at it as somewhat

12:36.880 --> 12:38.080
of a game, right?

12:38.080 --> 12:40.960
Not that we want to be cavalier, irresponsible about it.

12:40.960 --> 12:45.520
But when we look at it as a game, it seems like, for me at least, it helps me to kind

12:45.520 --> 12:50.720
of like lower the emotional, like tension or anxiety or whatever, and just like look

12:50.720 --> 12:51.760
at this as a game again.

12:51.760 --> 12:54.560
Moving pieces like, OK, I got to check these six boxes.

12:54.560 --> 12:56.400
What's the one thing that's holding me up?

12:56.400 --> 12:58.960
OK, I need the ads are holding me up or whatever.

12:58.960 --> 13:01.280
Or like, OK, I just can't get someone on the hook.

13:01.280 --> 13:01.600
Right.

13:02.160 --> 13:06.240
And so whatever it is, that is the dragon to slay at that moment.

13:06.240 --> 13:06.960
Right.

13:06.960 --> 13:10.320
And so Nick just said he's getting on now.

13:10.320 --> 13:13.200
So anyway, guys, I'm just excited to be getting back with things.

13:13.200 --> 13:18.640
And I mean, if it takes me a year to land a couple deals, the amount of progress you

13:18.640 --> 13:22.960
can make in a three month period in this business once the processes are dialed in

13:22.960 --> 13:24.560
makes it so worth it.

13:24.560 --> 13:28.400
And so just because it's going slow now or for me like, man, a couple of months.

13:28.400 --> 13:30.640
And to be fair, I really haven't been taking the action I should.

13:30.640 --> 13:31.760
So that's on my end.

13:31.760 --> 13:37.200
But again, just like looking at long picture, like a six month sprint, you guys have no

13:37.200 --> 13:37.840
idea.

13:37.840 --> 13:42.400
Like the people that are making like 10k plus a month in this business, a lot of them

13:42.400 --> 13:46.560
got there really fast once they kind of got through the weeds or got through the mud

13:46.560 --> 13:48.640
of the first couple of months or whatever.

13:48.640 --> 13:50.400
Like I know that's what happened with Jason.

13:50.400 --> 13:56.240
And I mean, obviously, we've all seen Ryan Dalton and his insane scaling in just a few

13:56.240 --> 13:57.600
short year or two.

13:57.600 --> 13:59.360
So Nick is stopping on now.

14:03.280 --> 14:03.760
All right.

14:05.280 --> 14:06.640
Aaron, can you hear me?

14:06.640 --> 14:07.520
I can hear you.

14:08.320 --> 14:08.720
Let's see.

14:08.720 --> 14:09.680
Can you hear me?

14:09.680 --> 14:09.920
Yeah.

14:09.920 --> 14:11.520
Let me try the mic.

14:11.520 --> 14:11.920
Hold on.

14:13.200 --> 14:13.760
How about now?

14:14.720 --> 14:15.360
I can hear you.

14:15.360 --> 14:15.920
Yeah, you're good.

14:16.720 --> 14:17.600
Everyone, can you hear Nick?

14:18.240 --> 14:19.120
You should be able to.

14:21.760 --> 14:23.520
Let me know as soon as you can hear me.

14:23.520 --> 14:24.640
I'm gonna pull up my notes.

14:25.520 --> 14:26.880
Yeah, yesterday, my mic wasn't working.

14:26.880 --> 14:28.800
I don't know what's going on, but good to hear.

14:29.600 --> 14:30.160
Yeah.

14:30.160 --> 14:30.480
Awesome.

14:30.480 --> 14:33.280
They say that they can hear you loud and clear, which is great.

14:35.920 --> 14:37.280
Let me see if I get my camera.

14:37.280 --> 14:38.400
Let me check on Facebook.

14:38.400 --> 14:40.320
I'm not seeing your screen on my screen.

14:40.320 --> 14:41.280
It might just be the.

14:41.280 --> 14:42.400
Oh, no, hold on.

14:42.400 --> 14:42.800
There we go.

14:42.800 --> 14:43.920
Can you see me now?

14:43.920 --> 14:44.160
Yeah.

14:45.120 --> 14:46.800
Oh, okay.

14:46.800 --> 14:49.040
So not to cut anyone off.

14:49.040 --> 14:49.840
Are you recording?

14:50.800 --> 14:51.440
Not yet.

14:51.440 --> 14:52.000
Here we go.

14:59.280 --> 14:59.760
Amazing.

15:00.720 --> 15:02.640
Thanks for starting this call, Aaron.

15:02.640 --> 15:03.760
Welcome to the call, guys.

15:04.720 --> 15:07.040
Aaron, did I cut you off in the middle of something?

15:07.760 --> 15:08.480
No, you're good, bro.

15:08.480 --> 15:12.240
Just reliving some sales deals and all that.

15:12.880 --> 15:13.680
Beautiful.

15:13.680 --> 15:14.480
Okay.

15:14.480 --> 15:17.280
Well, that said, guys, welcome to the call.

15:17.280 --> 15:22.960
If this is your first call, then just know we're going to be doing this forever.

15:22.960 --> 15:25.760
You're going to see this call at this time forever.

15:26.960 --> 15:28.960
I know it's a tiny bit early for some,

15:30.000 --> 15:34.240
but it's the best possible time we can do to get as many people as possible.

15:34.240 --> 15:36.960
So, Aaron, are you going to be able to stay on for this call?

15:37.680 --> 15:37.920
Yeah.

15:38.800 --> 15:39.120
Okay.

15:39.120 --> 15:43.440
So real quick, before we get started, did you talk about the podcast?

15:44.640 --> 15:45.360
Not yet.

15:45.360 --> 15:46.720
I'm just going to leave that to you.

15:46.720 --> 15:47.200
All right.

15:47.200 --> 15:55.680
So, guys, we decided that it would be beneficial for...

15:57.280 --> 16:00.080
I would say it's a bit selfish as well,

16:00.080 --> 16:05.120
but we decided that it would be a good idea to do not the classic,

16:06.640 --> 16:13.200
let me interview the random people in my town who are nobodies

16:13.200 --> 16:17.920
and let me have interviews with people that are not interesting.

16:19.440 --> 16:21.120
That's really bad.

16:21.680 --> 16:22.880
I hate those.

16:24.320 --> 16:30.240
We decided that there's so many nuanced things to this business model

16:30.240 --> 16:37.440
that it would be a good idea to just have an entire podcast,

16:37.440 --> 16:43.280
entire series, an entire show dedicated towards every single nuance

16:43.280 --> 16:45.520
and every single facet of this business.

16:45.520 --> 16:52.080
So we have launched the Digital Real Estate Secrets podcast.

16:52.080 --> 16:55.920
It's just basically 100% all things this business model.

16:55.920 --> 17:00.160
We're going to be talking about everything that you could think of,

17:00.160 --> 17:02.480
every single angle, whatever of this model.

17:02.720 --> 17:07.760
Obviously, we're not going to be teaching what we teach in the program,

17:08.720 --> 17:12.000
so don't think that that's going to be the same material

17:12.000 --> 17:15.280
or that we're going to replace or we're going to be talking about that,

17:15.280 --> 17:18.000
but we are going to be talking about high-level stuff.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.160
There may be some interviews-style stuff

17:20.160 --> 17:22.480
where we bring on guests that are in the space,

17:22.480 --> 17:25.200
but for those of you that want to check that out,

17:26.000 --> 17:27.840
you're going to see a new episode every single week.

17:27.840 --> 17:30.640
So, Aaron, I actually have the link.

17:30.640 --> 17:31.440
Let me go ahead.

17:32.720 --> 17:33.120
Hold on.

17:35.840 --> 17:36.240
Let me see.

17:36.240 --> 17:36.960
This will work.

17:36.960 --> 17:37.840
You can still hear me, right?

17:38.400 --> 17:39.040
Yeah, you're good.

17:39.600 --> 17:41.520
Okay, let me just make sure this is going to work here.

17:41.520 --> 17:45.200
By the way, while you pull that up, just a little shout out to Adair,

17:45.840 --> 17:49.760
locked in a 2,000 a month, six-month contract just this week.

17:50.960 --> 17:51.460
Okay.

17:52.720 --> 17:53.760
Making moves.

17:53.760 --> 17:56.400
A little $12,000, not a bad gig.

17:56.400 --> 17:57.440
I like that a lot.

17:58.720 --> 18:00.400
Okay, let me see if I can get this going.

18:00.480 --> 18:01.120
All right.

18:02.640 --> 18:03.120
Hold on.

18:03.680 --> 18:06.960
By the way, I see a few new faces

18:07.760 --> 18:10.000
that look like this is their first call,

18:10.000 --> 18:11.440
so welcome to the call.

18:11.440 --> 18:14.640
But anyway, congrats on the deal, Adair, by the way.

18:16.400 --> 18:17.600
That's what this is all about.

18:17.600 --> 18:19.120
It's getting that first deal.

18:19.120 --> 18:20.080
That's the most important deal,

18:20.080 --> 18:22.080
and then getting the next, and the next, and the next, and the next.

18:22.080 --> 18:25.840
So anyway, guys, check that out.

18:27.600 --> 18:29.680
Appreciate you guys, if you want to check that out,

18:29.680 --> 18:30.800
great if not, no big deal.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.320
But I may be asking some of you guys to come on,

18:34.320 --> 18:40.800
share your experience, share some of your tips, strategies, et cetera.

18:40.800 --> 18:43.520
So if we reach out, that would be super, super helpful.

18:43.520 --> 18:47.200
Also, Aaron, you had talked about the support and everything else, correct?

18:47.760 --> 18:49.680
I have not talked about that yet.

18:49.680 --> 18:51.840
I was going to wait one more week with...

18:51.840 --> 18:53.680
I'm warning we can't talk about that though, but...

18:54.240 --> 18:55.440
No, no, no, no, no, no problem.

18:56.080 --> 18:56.640
That's fine.

18:57.840 --> 18:58.720
That's completely fine.

18:58.720 --> 19:00.560
So last thing real quick, and then let's get started.

19:00.560 --> 19:02.000
I want to give away some stuff, dude.

19:02.000 --> 19:05.840
Let's give away a few things really quick.

19:06.480 --> 19:07.840
Aaron, I'm going to have you choose...

19:09.680 --> 19:11.200
So for those of you that don't know,

19:12.080 --> 19:16.960
we just have some items that we put together that you guys can use every day.

19:16.960 --> 19:18.240
We have these mouse pads.

19:19.040 --> 19:20.480
We have an AirPod case.

19:20.480 --> 19:21.760
We have a coffee mug.

19:21.760 --> 19:23.200
We have a...

19:23.200 --> 19:23.920
What am I missing?

19:25.040 --> 19:26.720
AirPod case, coffee mug.

19:27.680 --> 19:28.480
What's the last one?

19:29.120 --> 19:30.000
Besides the shirts.

19:30.960 --> 19:31.120
The...

19:33.920 --> 19:34.800
Is that it?

19:34.800 --> 19:36.160
Mouse pad, AirPod case.

19:36.160 --> 19:36.880
I think that's main four.

19:39.440 --> 19:40.640
Well, what am I missing, bro?

19:41.920 --> 19:44.560
The mouse pad, the coffee mug, the AirPod case.

19:44.560 --> 19:45.680
There's a fourth one, I thought.

19:45.680 --> 19:47.120
And the shirt, yeah, those four.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.360
Okay, I thought there's another one.

19:49.360 --> 19:50.000
I could be crazy.

19:50.000 --> 19:50.880
Bro, are you sure?

19:52.080 --> 19:54.240
Shopdigitalandlords.com, I guess we can take it.

19:54.800 --> 19:56.080
Yeah, let's look, dude.

19:56.080 --> 19:58.800
But while you're doing that, just keep the ball rolling.

19:58.800 --> 20:01.920
I will just have to give it to Aaron Smith.

20:01.920 --> 20:05.520
It looks like this is his first call in the game.

20:05.520 --> 20:06.960
So congrats, bro.

20:06.960 --> 20:07.680
Good to have you back.

20:07.680 --> 20:08.960
Jared Bell says, Fanny Pack.

20:09.520 --> 20:11.040
Gotta talk to Ashley and get back.

20:11.040 --> 20:13.280
It's the sticker, bro.

20:14.400 --> 20:15.520
Oh, I gotcha.

20:15.520 --> 20:16.640
Yeah, yeah, okay.

20:16.640 --> 20:17.840
So Aaron, what am I gonna have you do?

20:17.840 --> 20:21.840
I'm gonna go turn on my AC because I seem to forget every single time.

20:22.720 --> 20:23.680
Will you go ahead?

20:23.680 --> 20:26.560
I want you to choose, let's just say five winners.

20:27.680 --> 20:29.440
I want you to give away, or four winners.

20:29.440 --> 20:34.800
I want to have you give away a sticker, an AirPod case, a mug,

20:35.600 --> 20:37.840
and a mouse pad really quick.

20:37.840 --> 20:39.200
And then let's get this call rolling.

20:39.840 --> 20:42.000
Okay, so real quick, let's just see.

20:44.800 --> 20:48.160
You know what we'll do is, I'm not sure what you guys want.

20:48.160 --> 20:51.280
So we'll say, Aaron, you can just message,

20:52.080 --> 20:54.720
message fix it Felix in the group.

20:54.720 --> 21:00.640
And he'll hook you up with getting you a promo code for the merch store.

21:00.640 --> 21:02.640
So Aaron Smith, you got it.

21:02.640 --> 21:04.000
Let me just quickly reply.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.440
We'll say, and then we'll get this ball rolling with, again, 2D.

21:08.640 --> 21:10.880
Usually the intros don't take this long, by the way, guys.

21:10.880 --> 21:14.720
We had a few hangups with getting the call going, but it's all good.

21:14.720 --> 21:17.200
So we'll say, message fix it for your swag.

21:18.400 --> 21:19.040
Your swag.

21:19.600 --> 21:21.680
Okay, congrats, Aaron Smith.

21:22.400 --> 21:24.320
We'll say, Matthew, you're always here, bro.

21:25.200 --> 21:26.640
Let's give you something.

21:26.640 --> 21:27.840
Matthew Torres?

21:27.840 --> 21:28.400
Yep.

21:28.400 --> 21:29.440
Yeah, he's always showing up.

21:29.440 --> 21:30.000
I like that.

21:31.840 --> 21:34.400
Let's see, Daniel, how's it going, bro?

21:34.400 --> 21:35.440
You got something too?

21:36.240 --> 21:41.920
We got two more that we're going to give out for your swag.

21:42.560 --> 21:43.520
And then let's see.

21:44.800 --> 21:46.800
Stephanie, I think you've already gotten some items,

21:46.800 --> 21:48.240
but it's always great to have you here.

21:49.040 --> 21:50.560
Stephanie's always got that good energy.

21:50.560 --> 21:51.200
Give her something.

21:51.200 --> 21:51.760
I like that.

21:52.960 --> 21:54.240
We appreciate good energy.

21:54.240 --> 21:55.360
We appreciate positivity.

21:55.360 --> 21:57.680
We appreciate people that have the can do,

21:57.680 --> 21:59.440
I'm going to make it work attitude,

21:59.440 --> 22:03.440
not everyone else's fault that I'm not making a million dollars a second.

22:05.280 --> 22:06.400
Yeah, that makes sense.

22:06.400 --> 22:08.160
Nick, it might be a little late.

22:08.160 --> 22:09.440
If you do want to do the everyone tag,

22:09.920 --> 22:11.520
you have to do it on your mobile phone, I guess.

22:11.520 --> 22:12.800
So I can't because I'm not logged in.

22:14.160 --> 22:17.200
I'm not even, I'll download Facebook on my phone,

22:17.200 --> 22:19.280
but you know me, man, I'm like a drug addict.

22:19.280 --> 22:23.280
I have to take everything off my phone or I just spend all my time on it.

22:23.280 --> 22:24.880
I'll tag everyone as soon as it downloads.

22:24.880 --> 22:25.840
Did we give away four?

22:27.600 --> 22:28.400
We did do four.

22:28.400 --> 22:28.960
Yep.

22:28.960 --> 22:30.560
So I just messaged the winners.

22:30.560 --> 22:31.520
Let's get this thing going.

22:32.160 --> 22:35.360
Okay, guys, today we're going to be talking about the truth about second money.

22:36.080 --> 22:38.400
I get a little bit fired up about this topic

22:38.400 --> 22:41.200
because I felt like I was given misinformation.

22:41.200 --> 22:43.760
And so I am excited to talk about this.

22:43.760 --> 22:46.400
And I'm also excited for Aaron to give his feedback as well.

22:47.600 --> 22:48.560
So let me go ahead.

22:48.560 --> 22:49.680
I'm almost logged in now.

22:49.680 --> 22:51.520
I may as well just go ahead and finish this off.

22:52.240 --> 22:52.800
Hold on.

22:53.520 --> 22:54.080
Let's see.

22:57.200 --> 22:59.840
Okay, we're in the world groups.

23:01.760 --> 23:05.680
By the way, guys, life hack, if you want to get stuff done,

23:06.240 --> 23:08.640
just to get social media off your freaking phone,

23:08.640 --> 23:11.600
I promise you guys, even if you don't think it helps,

23:11.600 --> 23:13.360
just not just knowing you can't,

23:13.360 --> 23:15.920
you don't even have the ability to click on the stupid app

23:16.560 --> 23:19.520
is enough that I swear to you, it gives you superpowers.

23:19.520 --> 23:24.080
So what I try to do now, I fail weekly at this

23:24.080 --> 23:28.400
because I'll download it to post and then I'll leave it on like an idiot.

23:29.520 --> 23:32.720
But I just try not to keep the apps on my phone.

23:32.720 --> 23:37.040
And it's amazing that you start to use your brain.

23:37.040 --> 23:38.160
You start to think creatively.

23:38.160 --> 23:42.160
You start to have real conversations.

23:42.160 --> 23:43.040
You start to plan.

23:43.120 --> 23:46.400
And I think social media is such a powerful tool.

23:46.400 --> 23:49.600
I'm never going to be the guy that's like, don't use it, don't be on it.

23:49.600 --> 23:52.800
I think that's stupid, too, because you need to use it.

23:52.800 --> 23:54.320
I've made a lot of money from social media.

23:54.320 --> 23:55.520
I'm going to make a lot more money.

23:55.520 --> 23:57.920
I think you should be building a brand and an audience.

23:57.920 --> 24:02.720
However, I think that you should be like,

24:02.720 --> 24:04.800
hey, if I'm going to be on social media, I'm producing.

24:04.800 --> 24:05.840
I'm putting out content.

24:05.840 --> 24:12.000
I'm creating networking opportunities, et cetera.

24:12.400 --> 24:13.680
To sit there and scroll.

24:13.680 --> 24:16.240
And again, I fail every week, so I'm not saying I'm perfect,

24:16.240 --> 24:18.960
but it has been a huge deal to just delete it off my phone.

24:18.960 --> 24:22.240
So that said, guys, second money.

24:23.120 --> 24:24.240
Aaron, I'm curious.

24:24.240 --> 24:27.280
When I say second money, what do I mean?

24:27.280 --> 24:28.880
Do you have any idea what I'm talking about,

24:28.880 --> 24:30.560
what I'm saying with second money?

24:31.200 --> 24:34.480
I'm assuming you're saying something to the effect of an upsell

24:34.480 --> 24:38.160
or selling a current customer more.

24:38.160 --> 24:38.640
Correct.

24:39.600 --> 24:41.600
So when I say second money, I'm talking about

24:41.600 --> 24:45.280
you have a client and you go and you get a second money from them,

24:45.280 --> 24:47.280
a third money, a fourth money, a fifth money.

24:47.280 --> 24:50.560
They're already your client and you're going to go get money.

24:50.560 --> 24:56.320
Now, guys, I want to tell you that the idea and the theory of second money,

24:56.320 --> 24:59.440
it sounds so genius on paper.

24:59.440 --> 25:01.520
It makes all the sense in the world, right?

25:01.520 --> 25:05.600
Because they say getting a new client is the hardest part.

25:05.600 --> 25:07.360
I don't know who's they.

25:07.360 --> 25:10.640
I don't know where it's said, but I've heard that many times.

25:10.640 --> 25:12.880
The hardest thing to do is get a new client.

25:12.880 --> 25:15.200
The most expensive thing to do is get a new client.

25:15.200 --> 25:19.520
So in theory, taking a current client and just selling them something else,

25:19.520 --> 25:23.040
getting another chunk of money makes total sense.

25:23.040 --> 25:25.600
And it's kind of like paper lead, right?

25:25.600 --> 25:27.360
For those of you that are brand new to this group,

25:28.080 --> 25:32.320
we hear about, you know, I always talk about how much I dislike paper lead.

25:32.320 --> 25:34.000
And some of you guys are like, well, why?

25:34.720 --> 25:40.000
You know, you get paid according to how many leads you produce and blah, blah, blah.

25:40.000 --> 25:43.200
And I'm telling you guys on paper, paper lead sounds so good,

25:43.200 --> 25:45.760
but in theory and practice, it doesn't work.

25:45.760 --> 25:49.520
And I'm telling you guys on paper and in theory,

25:49.520 --> 25:54.080
second money sounds amazing, but in practice, that's not how it works.

25:54.080 --> 26:03.360
So long story short, guys, is like, I think it was back in 2000.

26:03.360 --> 26:03.680
I don't know.

26:03.680 --> 26:05.840
It was early in my career doing this.

26:05.840 --> 26:07.920
It was like 2018, 2019.

26:10.480 --> 26:11.760
I was in part of...

26:12.560 --> 26:14.160
Actually, let me back up just a little bit.

26:15.200 --> 26:19.040
Let me give you guys really quick the game plan of what we're going to be discussing today.

26:19.840 --> 26:22.960
And I'll start by saying that my goal with this live,

26:22.960 --> 26:25.280
my goal with this training is that by the end of this live,

26:25.280 --> 26:29.280
I want to basically expose to you the truth about second money, okay?

26:29.280 --> 26:33.840
And give you guys enough information to show you that it's not exactly how it appears

26:33.840 --> 26:39.040
and you need to consider all the costs before just going and focusing on it or asking for it, okay?

26:39.040 --> 26:41.200
So here's kind of the things I'm going to cover today.

26:41.200 --> 26:45.040
I'm going to be talking about this theory of second money and how genius it sounds on paper.

26:45.040 --> 26:48.400
I'm going to be talking about why I decided to try it, okay?

26:48.400 --> 26:49.920
And what I learned from it.

26:49.920 --> 26:53.440
Then I'm going to be talking about my experience and how it went.

26:53.440 --> 26:57.200
Then I'm going to be talking about what happened when I stopped doing it.

26:57.200 --> 27:00.800
Then I'm going to be talking about how I actually tried to do it again

27:00.800 --> 27:02.160
after I did it the first time.

27:02.720 --> 27:04.560
Then how to properly...

27:05.360 --> 27:05.840
Sorry.

27:05.840 --> 27:08.480
Yeah, you know, how to properly do second money

27:08.480 --> 27:10.320
because there is a proper way, I believe.

27:10.320 --> 27:13.040
Then I'm going to share a friend's story with second money

27:13.040 --> 27:14.560
and then I'm going to give you guys a challenge, okay?

27:14.560 --> 27:16.480
So that's kind of going to be what we're going to cover.

27:17.600 --> 27:19.680
I'll get through it pretty quick and then if we have questions,

27:20.320 --> 27:22.080
we're going to get through those at the end as well.

27:22.080 --> 27:28.080
So basically the theory of second money is you have a client, you go ask them for more money.

27:28.080 --> 27:32.400
You have a lead gen client, you go ask them to do their SEO with you.

27:32.400 --> 27:38.240
You have a lead gen client, you go ask them to go and use your white labeled software

27:38.240 --> 27:40.240
that you're doing with go high level.

27:40.240 --> 27:45.840
You have a client, you ask them to manage their Facebook account where you post every...

27:45.840 --> 27:49.040
And guys, Aaron, doesn't it make perfect sense?

27:49.040 --> 27:52.480
Literally on paper, it's like we don't have to go call.

27:52.480 --> 27:55.360
We don't have to go cultivate any new relationships.

27:55.360 --> 27:57.360
We just get new business.

27:57.360 --> 27:59.360
We just get new money from current clients.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.400
Am I wrong or does that not sound attractive to you?

28:03.040 --> 28:03.760
It's attractive.

28:05.600 --> 28:06.400
Have you tried it?

28:07.200 --> 28:08.000
I have not.

28:09.120 --> 28:14.240
To be fair, I haven't had that many customers to test it on, but I still hopefully wouldn't

28:14.240 --> 28:15.360
because I know what you're going to say.

28:15.360 --> 28:16.160
I believe it.

28:17.120 --> 28:23.600
So I just want to say this and just real quick before we get into why I decided to try it.

28:23.600 --> 28:27.280
Guys, going for second money, third money, fourth money, fifth money,

28:27.280 --> 28:32.480
any money outside of your original lead gen money before you are printing

28:32.480 --> 28:34.000
money with your first money.

28:34.480 --> 28:34.720
Okay.

28:35.280 --> 28:38.960
Obviously, if you're in this group, you should be focusing on lead generation.

28:38.960 --> 28:44.080
Now, I know some of you guys are in a situation where you need to get some cash coming in

28:44.080 --> 28:48.800
so you can quit your job, in which case I think the best way to do that is to do SEO,

28:50.720 --> 28:51.600
just FYI.

28:51.600 --> 28:57.600
And that's why if you guys heard me bring in Zach Powell, he has a really good process

28:57.600 --> 29:00.880
for getting SEO clients and getting that.

29:00.880 --> 29:03.440
But that should just be to quit your job.

29:03.440 --> 29:07.680
And if you don't need to quit your job immediately or you have enough money,

29:07.680 --> 29:12.320
I just think the long-term strategy, it's so much easier to just build a business

29:12.320 --> 29:16.160
where you quit your job on lead gen money because I was in a position

29:16.160 --> 29:17.920
where I didn't have money coming in.

29:17.920 --> 29:22.400
I had to go and do SEO and it's very easy to get sucked down the SEO trap.

29:22.400 --> 29:29.920
As sexy as it sounds, it's not scalable and it doesn't have the longevity that lead gen does.

29:29.920 --> 29:33.120
There's just, I don't care how you set it up, it's just not the same.

29:34.080 --> 29:37.120
But you guys are shooting yourself in the foot.

29:37.120 --> 29:38.560
You guys are crazy.

29:38.560 --> 29:41.600
If you guys are trying to go for second, third, fourth money

29:41.600 --> 29:45.120
before you are printing money with your first money,

29:45.120 --> 29:50.880
before you have your entire process automated and dialed in to the point

29:50.880 --> 29:52.640
where you don't even have to be involved.

29:53.840 --> 30:00.160
Because guys, what ends up happening is like this second money concept,

30:00.960 --> 30:04.640
you know, it's actually the same as starting another business.

30:04.640 --> 30:08.240
It's actually the same as distracting yourself with a completely separate business,

30:08.240 --> 30:12.240
but it disguises itself as a complimentary service.

30:12.240 --> 30:15.760
And I'm going to get into my experience doing it,

30:15.760 --> 30:22.560
but I'm just going to start and tell you upfront that splitting your attention,

30:22.560 --> 30:26.160
splitting your focus is so detrimental to growing your business.

30:26.160 --> 30:28.480
It's insane and sometimes you don't even recognize it

30:28.480 --> 30:32.240
because you won't see it immediately, but it's taxing to your bandwidth,

30:32.240 --> 30:33.920
it's taxing to your focus.

30:33.920 --> 30:36.960
And it's going to be the death of you.

30:36.960 --> 30:39.760
It's going to come at the expense of you hitting your goal, okay?

30:39.760 --> 30:44.560
So anything that I say for, I'm going to use the term second money,

30:44.560 --> 30:47.120
but it goes for third, fourth, fifth, sixth money, right?

30:48.080 --> 30:49.840
Second money would be like SEO.

30:49.840 --> 30:51.920
Third money would be like social media management.

30:51.920 --> 30:55.200
Fourth money would be like white label software.

30:55.200 --> 31:00.960
Fifth money could be doing swag, you know, I don't know what I'm on,

31:00.960 --> 31:03.120
sixth, seventh could be consulting.

31:03.840 --> 31:06.960
I mean, there's so many different layers to this because again,

31:06.960 --> 31:10.800
the theory is businesses spend money on all these different things.

31:10.800 --> 31:14.400
Let's go and get as many pieces of the pie as we possibly can.

31:14.400 --> 31:18.480
And again, we look at some of these examples like a Warren Buffett, right?

31:18.480 --> 31:24.800
And Warren Buffett, I think they said when you go and buy something at the store,

31:24.800 --> 31:26.480
he's making money on the credit card.

31:26.480 --> 31:27.760
He's making money on the Coke.

31:27.760 --> 31:29.680
He's making money on like four or five different things.

31:29.680 --> 31:31.040
And so we want to sit there.

31:31.040 --> 31:34.960
We want to mimic people like Warren Buffett, but we forget that Warren Buffett,

31:34.960 --> 31:38.160
he made his initial money by focusing on one thing.

31:38.160 --> 31:41.600
And then he's now diversified into how many income streams.

31:41.600 --> 31:45.040
So we confuse that when we hear we need seven income streams.

31:45.040 --> 31:50.480
No, you need one to get rich and you need to then diversify to keep your money

31:50.480 --> 31:51.680
and to grow your money.

31:51.680 --> 31:55.760
But you need one and you should focus on one to get that initial capital, okay?

31:55.760 --> 32:00.880
So again, guys, I want you to know that I understand that the theory of second money

32:00.880 --> 32:01.600
sounds sexy.

32:01.600 --> 32:02.320
It sounds fun.

32:02.320 --> 32:04.080
It sounds like, hey, I've got 10 clients.

32:04.080 --> 32:08.160
Like for example, Adair, I know he's gotten three, four, five deals

32:08.160 --> 32:10.000
because I've announced all of them.

32:10.000 --> 32:13.040
And congratulations, by the way, bro, that's no small feat.

32:13.040 --> 32:20.720
But it becomes very attractive to stop doing what we know works because it's hard.

32:20.720 --> 32:22.400
It's hard to go find new areas.

32:22.400 --> 32:25.120
It's hard to pick up the phone and do another cold call.

32:25.120 --> 32:27.600
It's hard to go and set up another ad campaign.

32:27.600 --> 32:32.480
And it sounds amazing to take our five clients or seven clients or 10 or 20 clients

32:32.480 --> 32:37.360
and say, hey, bro, hey, Joe, I'm going to do your SEO.

32:37.360 --> 32:39.280
It sounds very, very, very attractive.

32:39.280 --> 32:42.640
And I'm probably going against things I've said in the past.

32:42.640 --> 32:45.360
But that's the beauty of business is that I'm evolving and I'm growing.

32:45.360 --> 32:48.800
And maybe I'll even talk about this on the podcast this week or next week.

32:48.800 --> 32:51.760
But this is from experience.

32:51.760 --> 32:56.240
And that's the thing that I can sit here and tell you with conviction is that

32:56.240 --> 32:58.800
I've tried this and I've tried it multiple times.

32:58.800 --> 33:00.880
And this is how it works.

33:00.880 --> 33:04.960
So guys, I'm going to tell you now why I decided to try it

33:04.960 --> 33:07.120
and then what I learned from it.

33:07.120 --> 33:12.240
So again, back in like 2000, I think 17, 18, 19, somewhere in there,

33:14.480 --> 33:17.280
somebody that I was in another group, I was in multiple groups,

33:17.280 --> 33:18.480
but I was the course guy.

33:18.480 --> 33:19.680
I bought so many programs.

33:19.680 --> 33:23.840
I think I spent around 23,000.

33:23.840 --> 33:26.640
They have calculated 23 to 30,000 somewhere in there.

33:27.600 --> 33:29.920
That's only on rank and rent programs.

33:29.920 --> 33:31.040
That's only on marketing.

33:31.040 --> 33:36.400
That doesn't include any type of like one-on-one coaching or whatever.

33:36.400 --> 33:40.880
This is just with rank and rent specific marketing programs.

33:40.880 --> 33:46.720
And there was a piece of advice that I got from somebody in one of these programs.

33:46.720 --> 33:53.200
And that was that I was a fool for not going for second, third, fourth money.

33:53.200 --> 33:57.040
And the thing that tricked me, the thing that confused me is this person

33:57.040 --> 33:58.880
actually does make a lot of money.

33:59.840 --> 34:02.240
They just don't make a lot of money doing this.

34:02.240 --> 34:03.280
They just don't make a lot.

34:03.280 --> 34:04.960
And they never did.

34:04.960 --> 34:07.440
And that's the thing that we need to distinguish, guys,

34:08.080 --> 34:11.920
is that there's a lot of people out there that are making money

34:12.720 --> 34:16.960
by teaching things and not doing the thing that they teach.

34:18.240 --> 34:22.000
That's basically every other person out there teaching rank and rent

34:22.000 --> 34:23.120
because I know all of them.

34:24.400 --> 34:26.480
There's an exception or two.

34:26.480 --> 34:30.560
But majority of them, they made $10,000 one time

34:30.560 --> 34:33.600
and they decided, hey, I'm going to throw together a program

34:33.600 --> 34:37.360
and I'm going to teach people how to do this, which is cool.

34:37.360 --> 34:38.320
That's great.

34:38.320 --> 34:41.760
But how do you coach somebody past your skill level?

34:42.640 --> 34:44.000
I talked about this a few weeks back.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.560
How do you convert someone past your own conversion?

34:46.560 --> 34:49.600
How do I train you how to get to $100,000 a month

34:49.600 --> 34:50.880
if I've never been there?

34:51.680 --> 34:54.560
And so be very careful because I know some of you guys

34:54.560 --> 34:56.000
are in other groups.

34:56.000 --> 34:57.600
Some of you guys are in multiple groups

34:57.600 --> 34:59.680
and especially those of you that are in free groups.

34:59.680 --> 35:00.160
I see you.

35:00.160 --> 35:02.960
I see some of you guys pouring yourself out

35:02.960 --> 35:08.880
and jumping at every single free piece of information, free PDF.

35:08.880 --> 35:11.360
It's from some no name in a group.

35:12.160 --> 35:14.960
If they're in the model, you don't even know if it's a human.

35:14.960 --> 35:17.440
You don't even know if they even know what money is.

35:18.880 --> 35:20.320
You don't know any of this stuff.

35:20.320 --> 35:23.760
And I see you guys getting all these free things.

35:24.640 --> 35:26.320
And guys, just because something's free

35:26.320 --> 35:27.520
doesn't mean you should take it.

35:28.560 --> 35:31.360
I had a dog took a freaking dump in my front yard.

35:31.360 --> 35:32.560
That cost me no dollars.

35:32.560 --> 35:37.280
I'm not going to keep the dung and sprinkle it on my garden.

35:38.240 --> 35:39.040
It was free.

35:40.000 --> 35:41.440
I was so pissed.

35:41.440 --> 35:43.600
By the way, Aaron, I know you have dogs, right?

35:44.400 --> 35:45.040
We doubt.

35:45.600 --> 35:46.400
I thought you had a dog.

35:46.400 --> 35:46.960
OK.

35:46.960 --> 35:48.320
So I was going to make this announcement.

35:48.320 --> 35:49.280
Maybe you guys could tell me.

35:49.280 --> 35:50.640
I was so pissed yesterday.

35:50.640 --> 35:54.560
We brought the boat in and I saw three piles of shit.

35:54.560 --> 35:56.160
And I'm sorry because I wasn't going to curse.

35:56.160 --> 35:59.120
But I saw three piles of shit on my front yard, right?

35:59.680 --> 36:00.960
Is this on the artificial grass?

36:01.520 --> 36:04.480
On my artificial grass, paid for by Dre, by the way.

36:04.480 --> 36:05.920
But on my artificial grass, thank goodness

36:05.920 --> 36:06.640
it was artificial grass.

36:06.640 --> 36:07.600
I could spray it off.

36:07.600 --> 36:10.000
But I swear to you, I have a Facebook group in my community

36:10.000 --> 36:11.360
and I'm going to put on there.

36:11.360 --> 36:14.000
And if you guys love dogs, you could be offended.

36:14.000 --> 36:15.120
I don't care.

36:15.120 --> 36:17.840
I'm going to take a picture of all three piles.

36:17.840 --> 36:20.400
And I'm going to post it on our community group and say,

36:21.600 --> 36:23.600
we just installed new cameras.

36:24.720 --> 36:27.920
If I catch your dog taking a shit on my front yard,

36:27.920 --> 36:29.440
you could pick it up at the crematory.

36:30.480 --> 36:33.360
Ha ha ha ha ha in an ash box.

36:33.360 --> 36:34.000
OK.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
So don't eat shit on my front yard.

36:36.560 --> 36:40.240
Anyway, just because it's free does not mean that you guys

36:40.240 --> 36:41.360
should actually take it.

36:41.360 --> 36:41.840
OK.

36:41.840 --> 36:43.280
So I listen to this guy.

36:43.280 --> 36:46.400
He gave me free advice and the dude makes a lot of money.

36:46.400 --> 36:48.000
But he doesn't make it doing this.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.640
That's the whole point of this conversation is that, guys,

36:50.640 --> 36:53.920
if they don't make money doing this, why are you listening to it?

36:53.920 --> 36:54.640
OK.

36:54.640 --> 36:55.840
Why are you listening to it?

36:55.840 --> 36:58.320
Dave Ramsey, perfect example.

36:58.320 --> 37:00.160
Everybody listens to Dave Ramsey.

37:00.720 --> 37:04.720
Dave Ramsey does not make his money by following his own advice.

37:05.680 --> 37:13.840
That's the irony behind good old Dave and his program and his radio show.

37:13.840 --> 37:16.800
He does not make money doing what he preaches.

37:17.840 --> 37:19.680
So I don't know how that guy goes to bed at night.

37:19.680 --> 37:23.920
It would feel really weird to me to be making a lot of money

37:23.920 --> 37:25.600
and have never made a million dollars.

37:25.600 --> 37:29.120
That's why I just shake my head at people that are like,

37:29.120 --> 37:30.160
I'm going to start a program.

37:30.160 --> 37:30.400
Good.

37:30.400 --> 37:31.440
That's your choice.

37:31.440 --> 37:32.080
Good luck.

37:32.080 --> 37:32.800
OK.

37:32.800 --> 37:34.560
Anyway, I decided to give this a try.

37:35.520 --> 37:37.600
And the mistake that I made, guys,

37:37.600 --> 37:40.640
is that I followed somebody's advice that wasn't in the game.

37:40.640 --> 37:42.800
I followed somebody's advice that was making money

37:42.800 --> 37:45.360
by doing something different than what they were talking about.

37:45.360 --> 37:48.880
And so that's the biggest thing that I learned, guys,

37:48.880 --> 37:51.920
is that you have like the number one thing I learned,

37:51.920 --> 37:53.600
apart from the fact that it's not a good idea,

37:54.240 --> 37:58.960
is that it taught me that I can't listen to anything

37:58.960 --> 38:03.600
that this person is saying past $10,000 a month,

38:03.600 --> 38:06.880
because I think this person had made like $24,000

38:06.880 --> 38:08.560
in one month or two months,

38:08.560 --> 38:10.080
but they hadn't made anything past that.

38:10.080 --> 38:11.520
And so that was the biggest thing it taught me,

38:11.520 --> 38:14.800
is that just because the thing that they're teaching me

38:14.800 --> 38:16.560
worked for them in this other business,

38:16.560 --> 38:18.880
it's not necessarily applicable to this business.

38:18.880 --> 38:20.800
And so I want you guys to remember

38:21.760 --> 38:23.840
that if nothing else inside this group, guys,

38:23.840 --> 38:27.440
I've been to the place that you guys like so far,

38:28.080 --> 38:29.840
no one has passed where I got to.

38:29.840 --> 38:32.240
I got to $124,000 per month.

38:32.240 --> 38:35.600
I do not know anyone that has gotten to that point.

38:35.600 --> 38:38.240
And I know I see people on social media

38:39.280 --> 38:41.600
talking about making $140,000.

38:41.600 --> 38:45.600
And dude, in fact, there's a couple of brothers right now,

38:46.160 --> 38:47.280
they live in my hometown,

38:48.400 --> 38:51.520
and they have a program apparently, okay?

38:51.520 --> 38:54.560
Never heard of these guys, never heard of them.

38:54.560 --> 38:56.800
And they're posting about making $140,000.

38:57.520 --> 39:00.080
So they watch all of my stories.

39:00.080 --> 39:02.080
They follow me, they have for years.

39:02.080 --> 39:03.760
And I've tried to reach out to them a couple of times

39:03.760 --> 39:05.040
to just have a conversation

39:05.040 --> 39:07.520
because I think that they're a scam.

39:07.520 --> 39:09.680
So I'd messaged them literally the other day.

39:09.680 --> 39:12.640
And I was like, hey guys, Nick here.

39:13.520 --> 39:15.040
Love to hop on the phone and chat

39:15.040 --> 39:16.160
and see what you guys got going on

39:16.160 --> 39:17.520
since we're in the same town.

39:18.080 --> 39:19.760
This is my second message.

39:19.760 --> 39:23.520
And it says active like four minutes ago.

39:23.520 --> 39:24.720
These guys don't read my message.

39:24.720 --> 39:27.040
So I just messaged them like, hey, it's ironic

39:27.280 --> 39:30.000
that you guys watch all my stories.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.560
You guys are fanboys, but you can't,

39:32.560 --> 39:34.080
you're pretending not to see my message.

39:35.280 --> 39:36.880
Anyway, long story short,

39:36.880 --> 39:38.560
these guys aren't making $140,000.

39:38.560 --> 39:39.520
I promise you that.

39:40.400 --> 39:44.080
I posted my tax returns inside the free group, okay?

39:44.080 --> 39:46.640
My tax returns are inside the free group

39:46.640 --> 39:49.600
for those of you that doubt the money that I've made.

39:49.600 --> 39:51.600
Because it really bothered me

39:52.240 --> 39:54.720
and does bother me when people just make false claims.

39:54.720 --> 39:56.560
So that's the biggest thing that I learned

39:56.560 --> 39:58.000
and that's what I want you guys to take away

39:58.000 --> 40:00.240
is it drives me nuts when I see you guys commenting

40:00.240 --> 40:02.080
inside of these other Facebook groups

40:02.080 --> 40:05.280
and inside these other programs that I'm also a part of.

40:05.280 --> 40:07.520
And you guys are just getting free stuff.

40:07.520 --> 40:10.720
I just got an email today from another rank and rank group.

40:10.720 --> 40:12.160
It's a program that I bought.

40:12.160 --> 40:13.360
It's a friend of mine.

40:13.360 --> 40:14.800
And he's like promoting this.

40:14.800 --> 40:17.120
The dude doesn't make any money on this stuff, okay?

40:17.120 --> 40:21.120
So just freaking listen to people that you are like,

40:21.120 --> 40:23.520
if they haven't been somewhere you want to go

40:23.520 --> 40:24.720
and stop listening to them.

40:24.720 --> 40:28.000
So anyway, that's why I decided to try it

40:28.000 --> 40:30.080
and that's what I learned, okay?

40:30.080 --> 40:31.600
Now, let me tell you about my experience.

40:33.120 --> 40:34.960
When I did this, when I implemented this,

40:36.240 --> 40:39.120
what ended up happening is first and foremost,

40:39.120 --> 40:40.640
I became very relieved.

40:40.640 --> 40:42.240
Because I remember sitting there thinking,

40:42.240 --> 40:45.120
wow, I hate cold calling people.

40:45.120 --> 40:47.040
And yeah, I've made it to this point,

40:47.040 --> 40:48.560
but I don't like to call people.

40:48.560 --> 40:50.240
And if I didn't imagine,

40:50.240 --> 40:52.320
if I don't have to call any new business owners,

40:52.320 --> 40:54.000
I don't have to talk to any new people.

40:54.000 --> 40:55.200
I don't have to meet anybody else.

40:56.080 --> 40:59.120
That'd be so nice because guys, it's scary.

40:59.120 --> 41:01.600
Even to this day for me to pick up this phone

41:01.600 --> 41:04.240
and call strangers, it's still uncomfortable.

41:04.240 --> 41:05.600
It's always gonna be uncomfortable

41:05.600 --> 41:07.600
because it's always easier to talk to people

41:07.600 --> 41:09.280
that you know, right?

41:09.280 --> 41:13.760
And so I remembered my initial reaction to this is like,

41:13.760 --> 41:15.920
I had a big sense of relief because I was like,

41:15.920 --> 41:17.680
oh my gosh, this is gonna be so nice.

41:17.680 --> 41:19.600
I'm not gonna have to talk to anybody new.

41:19.600 --> 41:21.280
I'm gonna take my 10 clients.

41:21.280 --> 41:22.800
I'm gonna sell them SEO.

41:22.880 --> 41:24.960
Then I'm gonna sell them social media marketing.

41:24.960 --> 41:27.520
And dude, I'm gonna triple my revenue, Aaron.

41:27.520 --> 41:29.360
I'm gonna triple my revenue.

41:29.360 --> 41:31.680
I'm gonna go from, you know, 10,000 a month.

41:31.680 --> 41:33.920
Then with that first hit, maybe not even quite triple,

41:33.920 --> 41:38.480
but let's say I sell 70% of the people on SEO.

41:38.480 --> 41:42.400
You know, I'm gonna go from 10,000 to 17,000 like that, right?

41:42.400 --> 41:43.840
And then I'm gonna sell them social media.

41:43.840 --> 41:45.520
Maybe I'll only get 50% from there.

41:45.520 --> 41:48.800
So I'm gonna be at like 22,000 bucks in a month

41:48.800 --> 41:50.800
by just selling them these other services.

41:50.800 --> 41:51.840
Aaron, what do you think happened?

41:53.520 --> 41:55.360
You didn't triple or even double.

41:57.200 --> 42:02.000
Not only did I not grow, my revenue actually went down, dude.

42:04.000 --> 42:05.120
It actually went down.

42:05.120 --> 42:05.620
Why?

42:06.560 --> 42:10.240
Because, well, number one is I took my eye off the main thing

42:10.240 --> 42:11.360
and the main thing is Legion

42:11.360 --> 42:12.720
and that's the only thing that scales.

42:12.720 --> 42:16.560
And so my service, my core service suffered, okay?

42:16.560 --> 42:18.960
And because my core service suffered, guess what happened?

42:18.960 --> 42:21.760
My referrals that I wasn't once getting

42:21.760 --> 42:24.400
that was helping me grow my business completely dried up

42:24.400 --> 42:27.600
because now those little tiny touches that I was making,

42:27.600 --> 42:30.400
those checking in here, checking in there,

42:32.160 --> 42:33.600
you guys saw me post this recently,

42:33.600 --> 42:35.680
sending flowers to my customer's wife

42:36.320 --> 42:38.880
because I had the mental bandwidth to do it.

42:38.880 --> 42:40.720
Not that that's gonna necessarily grow your business.

42:40.720 --> 42:43.280
Getting clients success and getting them results

42:43.280 --> 42:44.000
is the number one thing,

42:44.000 --> 42:46.480
but just those little touches,

42:46.480 --> 42:48.080
I didn't even have the bandwidth for them.

42:48.080 --> 42:51.040
So not only did my business not grow,

42:51.040 --> 42:52.080
but it actually went down.

42:52.080 --> 42:54.000
My core service suffered.

42:54.000 --> 42:57.120
My referrals completely dried up

42:57.120 --> 43:01.280
and I actually had and struggled to have a hard time.

43:01.280 --> 43:05.120
I had a hard time retaining the clients that I did have.

43:05.120 --> 43:08.320
My current clients then became a challenge to even keep those.

43:08.320 --> 43:12.000
There was literally no growth and there was just frustration.

43:12.000 --> 43:15.760
And actually my bottom line number went down

43:15.760 --> 43:17.760
because guess what?

43:17.760 --> 43:19.120
I added another service

43:19.120 --> 43:20.800
and here's one of the services I offered.

43:20.800 --> 43:22.320
I was so smart, guys.

43:22.320 --> 43:25.040
I was like, I'm gonna do white label Go High Level.

43:26.400 --> 43:28.080
Aaron, you haven't done that?

43:28.080 --> 43:29.840
I barely know what that is, yeah.

43:29.840 --> 43:34.080
So Go High Level is a software that used a CRM.

43:34.080 --> 43:36.400
They have this program, it's genius.

43:36.400 --> 43:41.200
You can go and you can pay to white label their software

43:41.200 --> 43:43.520
and anything you sell above a certain price point

43:43.520 --> 43:45.520
you get to keep and it's so scalable

43:45.520 --> 43:46.800
and you're gonna promote it

43:46.800 --> 43:48.640
and all this different stuff, right?

43:48.720 --> 43:52.240
So that was a really cool service that I offered.

43:52.240 --> 43:56.480
Curious, is there anybody that's like confident enough

43:56.480 --> 43:59.920
or secure enough to admit in the chat

43:59.920 --> 44:03.520
that they've tried that scam of a business model?

44:04.320 --> 44:05.120
Has anyone done that?

44:05.120 --> 44:06.080
I would love to know.

44:06.080 --> 44:07.600
By the way, Aaron, if somebody's comments

44:07.600 --> 44:10.400
that says they've tried it, cut me off and tell me, okay?

44:12.000 --> 44:14.720
Yeah, if not, you guys are, I'm happy

44:14.720 --> 44:16.320
because you guys are smarter than me.

44:16.320 --> 44:17.680
But guys, guess what?

44:17.680 --> 44:19.920
I didn't know how to do Go High Level.

44:19.920 --> 44:24.080
I didn't know how to sell soft, like that kind of software.

44:24.080 --> 44:25.280
I didn't know how to set it up.

44:25.280 --> 44:27.040
I didn't know what, like whatever.

44:27.040 --> 44:28.400
So guess what I did?

44:28.400 --> 44:31.680
I went and hired somebody that was familiar

44:31.680 --> 44:37.040
with Go High Level and I paid them, wasn't crazy

44:37.040 --> 44:39.920
but I think I paid them like, for me at the time

44:39.920 --> 44:40.880
it was really crazy.

44:40.880 --> 44:43.440
It was like 3,500, 4,000 bucks a month.

44:43.520 --> 44:48.160
So I basically, 50K a year to do this whole new service.

44:48.160 --> 44:51.040
That was 50K that I had to make up

44:51.040 --> 44:53.120
just to be at the same point net.

44:54.880 --> 44:57.040
So that was just one service.

44:57.040 --> 45:01.760
I also was offering SEO, third money maybe.

45:01.760 --> 45:03.840
Then I was offering social media management.

45:04.480 --> 45:07.600
Hey Joe, yeah, we actually are pretty good

45:07.600 --> 45:08.800
at managing Facebook.

45:08.800 --> 45:09.680
Check this page out.

45:09.680 --> 45:13.200
We've grown our evergreen page to a thousand likes

45:13.200 --> 45:15.040
and we're getting a lot of views on our videos.

45:15.680 --> 45:16.960
We can actually give you a quote

45:16.960 --> 45:18.400
on managing your Facebook page.

45:18.400 --> 45:18.880
What do you think?

45:20.480 --> 45:21.600
Six service, huh, Aaron?

45:22.720 --> 45:23.040
Yeah.

45:23.040 --> 45:24.000
Six is better than five.

45:24.560 --> 45:27.680
Dude, we were an all encompassing agency.

45:30.000 --> 45:32.400
We offer every service, bro.

45:32.400 --> 45:35.840
A to Z, soup to nuts.

45:35.840 --> 45:38.080
We were the full pack, dude.

45:38.080 --> 45:41.200
We were the Michael Jordan of agencies, bro.

45:41.760 --> 45:44.480
You come into our agency, we got you, dude.

45:44.480 --> 45:45.520
We're getting you leads.

45:46.640 --> 45:47.920
We're building you a new site.

45:48.480 --> 45:49.680
We're going to do your SEO.

45:50.560 --> 45:51.920
We can manage your Facebook.

45:52.560 --> 45:54.400
Need t-shirts, we got you.

45:54.960 --> 45:57.440
Need a CRM, check that, baby.

45:58.800 --> 46:01.680
Dude, you want consulting, call your boy.

46:03.040 --> 46:06.320
Dude, it's so funny because you think I'm joking, dude.

46:06.320 --> 46:10.640
You want merchant services, got a solution for you, dude.

46:11.600 --> 46:15.920
We're a full stack marketing agency, bro.

46:16.800 --> 46:17.520
That's it, dude.

46:17.520 --> 46:18.480
That's what I thought.

46:20.480 --> 46:24.560
How long were you chasing the non-leash end services?

46:25.440 --> 46:28.160
Stop, bro.

46:28.160 --> 46:31.520
Stop, stop offering these services.

46:32.400 --> 46:36.640
I like seven businesses, seven, dude.

46:36.640 --> 46:40.080
And I was telling myself that I was just a full stack

46:40.080 --> 46:41.520
marketing company, dude.

46:42.320 --> 46:43.920
A to Z, bro.

46:44.560 --> 46:46.640
Come in, dude, I got you covered, dude.

46:46.640 --> 46:47.600
There's something else.

46:47.600 --> 46:48.800
Oh, there was a point.

46:48.800 --> 46:51.040
Hold on, hold on, 2020.

46:51.040 --> 46:54.720
We were offering masks, masks, bro.

46:55.520 --> 46:56.480
I can't make this stuff up.

46:56.480 --> 47:00.080
You guys think I'm making this for like comic and dramatic effect?

47:00.080 --> 47:04.240
I promise you, you go ask anyone that was working with me, Francesca.

47:05.680 --> 47:08.880
Kyle wasn't with me at the time, but Francesca, go ask Francesca.

47:09.360 --> 47:10.960
This is real stuff, dude.

47:10.960 --> 47:12.000
This is pathetic.

47:12.960 --> 47:15.680
Luckily, I've moved past the point where I can like laugh about this stuff.

47:15.680 --> 47:16.160
Dude, I thought-

47:16.160 --> 47:17.920
That wasn't long ago, 2022?

47:19.120 --> 47:23.600
That 20, it was, so 2020 was the year we started doing this.

47:24.480 --> 47:24.800
Sorry.

47:25.840 --> 47:30.800
So 2019, so this is the embarrassing part that's funny, right?

47:30.800 --> 47:33.920
So 2018, 19 is when I first started doing this.

47:34.480 --> 47:38.560
And then 2020, not to cut ahead of myself, is when I stopped doing it.

47:39.120 --> 47:40.720
Scaled, go figure.

47:40.720 --> 47:43.280
Then end of 2021, I did it again.

47:45.120 --> 47:48.640
Then I just did it again this year and it was a completely,

47:48.640 --> 47:50.000
and I'll talk about that here in a second.

47:50.000 --> 47:53.040
Anyway, guys, long story short, I didn't grow.

47:53.040 --> 47:56.160
Now, the interesting part, I know there's probably somebody on here

47:56.160 --> 47:58.800
that's like, yeah, I actually just did that and I made some money.

47:59.520 --> 47:59.840
Cool.

48:00.960 --> 48:06.080
But I guarantee that it's coming at the expense of a much bigger payday

48:06.080 --> 48:08.720
that you could have got if you would have just focused on Legion.

48:09.520 --> 48:10.240
Because guess what?

48:10.240 --> 48:12.720
I initially got a deal or two too.

48:12.720 --> 48:14.800
I got one or two people that said yes to me.

48:15.360 --> 48:19.360
Yeah, I got a couple SEO clients and that's what gave me the confidence

48:19.360 --> 48:21.840
to offer the next six services, okay?

48:21.840 --> 48:23.920
So here's what happened.

48:23.920 --> 48:26.240
2019, you guys know the story, I almost quit.

48:26.240 --> 48:27.280
I was tired of this.

48:27.280 --> 48:28.640
I was like, you know what?

48:28.640 --> 48:31.360
I'm not cut out to be a marketing agency.

48:31.360 --> 48:35.280
You know, six months earlier, I was full stack, baby.

48:35.280 --> 48:38.960
I was offering everything, dude, everything.

48:39.520 --> 48:40.800
And then six months later, I was like,

48:40.800 --> 48:42.480
I don't know if I'm ready to do marketing.

48:42.480 --> 48:43.840
I don't know if I should be in business.

48:43.840 --> 48:45.520
I think I should just be a sales guy.

48:45.520 --> 48:47.120
So you guys know the story, 2019,

48:47.120 --> 48:49.440
I just about walked away from doing business for myself.

48:49.440 --> 48:51.360
I was going to be a sales guy for somebody else,

48:51.920 --> 48:54.640
had everything lined out and I luckily pulled my head out

48:54.640 --> 48:56.000
and I was like, you know what, Nick?

48:56.000 --> 48:57.760
No, you have to figure this out

48:57.760 --> 48:59.280
because that's how you're going to get rich

48:59.280 --> 49:01.680
is you have to have your own thing, right?

49:01.680 --> 49:04.000
It's back to the Naval Ravicon, his book.

49:04.640 --> 49:07.200
And he talks about like how to get rich without being lucky.

49:08.080 --> 49:09.520
You have to own the business

49:09.520 --> 49:11.440
or at least a part of the business, right?

49:12.560 --> 49:15.280
That's the only way to get to the true money.

49:15.280 --> 49:17.520
And then I was like, well, this also is recurring.

49:17.520 --> 49:19.120
This also is asset-based.

49:19.120 --> 49:21.200
And I started checking all the boxes and I'm like,

49:21.200 --> 49:22.560
yeah, this is the right business.

49:22.560 --> 49:23.600
I just have to figure this out.

49:23.600 --> 49:28.800
So 2019, beginning of 2020, that's what I did, right?

49:28.800 --> 49:30.240
Is I got rid of everything.

49:30.240 --> 49:34.080
I got rid of every single thing except for Legion.

49:34.640 --> 49:37.120
And ironically, eight months later,

49:37.120 --> 49:38.640
I hit a hundred thousand dollars a month.

49:39.440 --> 49:43.040
No BS, no like it wasn't, you know,

49:44.080 --> 49:47.920
August, it wasn't June, it wasn't October,

49:47.920 --> 49:51.520
July of 2020, we hit a hundred thousand dollars per month.

49:51.520 --> 49:54.960
And eight months earlier, 2019, December,

49:54.960 --> 49:58.720
we barely hit like eight to 10, okay?

49:58.720 --> 50:01.040
So you'd think I would learn, but that's what happened.

50:01.040 --> 50:05.040
As soon as I got rid of everything, I started growing.

50:05.040 --> 50:06.080
Now I'm going to jump ahead a little bit.

50:06.080 --> 50:08.480
One of my buddies, I guess I'd call him

50:08.480 --> 50:10.480
more of a business acquaintance.

50:10.480 --> 50:12.880
You guys probably saw this photo I posted recently

50:12.880 --> 50:14.720
on my personal page, maybe you didn't,

50:14.720 --> 50:16.960
but I did a podcast with this guy named Dan Henry.

50:18.800 --> 50:21.840
He's a really sharp dude, whatever.

50:21.840 --> 50:25.840
It was when I was in Dubai and he shared this reel

50:25.840 --> 50:26.960
just the other day.

50:26.960 --> 50:30.400
And he said that when he started in business

50:30.400 --> 50:35.680
and he did really well, he got up to $250,000 per month.

50:36.320 --> 50:38.400
He had one program or one service

50:38.400 --> 50:39.760
or one product he was selling.

50:39.760 --> 50:40.960
I can't remember what it was at the time.

50:41.840 --> 50:43.920
He got to 250 and he's like,

50:44.640 --> 50:46.960
I'm going to add more products so I can get to a million

50:46.960 --> 50:48.080
or whatever he was trying to get to.

50:48.880 --> 50:51.680
And I think you might've heard me say this yesterday, Aaron,

50:51.680 --> 50:54.880
but dude, he went down from 250.

50:54.880 --> 51:00.240
He added 12 or 13 products and it dropped him to 70,000 per month.

51:01.280 --> 51:02.480
Which is still a lot of money,

51:02.480 --> 51:05.680
but when you're making three and a half times that much,

51:05.680 --> 51:07.200
it's a kick in the pants, right?

51:08.640 --> 51:10.880
So apparently he joined this mastermind

51:10.880 --> 51:13.440
and the guy's like, tell me about your business, blah, blah, blah.

51:13.440 --> 51:15.360
He's like, yeah, 13 different offers.

51:15.360 --> 51:16.960
The guy was like, get rid of 12.

51:17.920 --> 51:20.000
Or he had 14, he said, get rid of 13.

51:20.000 --> 51:22.960
And he's like, okay, he got rid of everything but one.

51:22.960 --> 51:25.680
And he scaled up to 500,000 a month.

51:26.720 --> 51:28.960
Okay, guys, he's done it.

51:28.960 --> 51:29.920
I've done it.

51:29.920 --> 51:31.520
Hermosy's talked about it.

51:31.520 --> 51:34.080
If you guys are offering multiple services, you're stupid.

51:35.040 --> 51:38.480
And I hope someone could clip that and whatever, that's fine.

51:38.480 --> 51:41.360
But until you are printing cash,

51:42.000 --> 51:48.320
until your first service is an automated cash juicing machine,

51:48.320 --> 51:51.280
you guys are losing and costing yourself

51:51.280 --> 51:53.680
thousands and tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of dollars

51:53.680 --> 51:55.920
by offering multiple services, okay?

51:55.920 --> 51:58.080
So 2020, I scaled.

51:59.360 --> 52:03.360
Beginning of 2021, I started to think about the same idea again.

52:03.360 --> 52:06.080
And that's why you guys hear me talking about selling masks, right?

52:06.080 --> 52:09.440
2020, 2021, everyone is starting to make money and selling masks.

52:09.440 --> 52:14.240
I had some friends that were making supposedly big money in masks.

52:14.240 --> 52:16.240
And I think some of them actually did.

52:16.240 --> 52:18.880
And so I don't know how,

52:18.880 --> 52:23.760
but I forgot that that was the thing that caused me not to scale.

52:23.760 --> 52:26.320
And so I started offering services again.

52:26.320 --> 52:29.280
And I started doing this whole BS again, guys.

52:29.280 --> 52:34.800
And in 2021, what ended up happening is this time I made more money.

52:34.800 --> 52:43.360
So I went from 7,000 or 7 figures, like just over a million, to 1.4, 1.45, 1.5 million.

52:43.360 --> 52:44.800
This has nothing to do with this program.

52:44.800 --> 52:46.560
This is just on my business.

52:47.360 --> 52:51.760
But I actually did not make any additional money, bottom line.

52:52.480 --> 52:53.920
I made the same amount of money.

52:53.920 --> 52:56.880
I did 50% more work.

52:56.880 --> 52:58.320
And I made the same amount of money.

53:01.120 --> 53:03.040
How much more time did I spend away from my family?

53:03.040 --> 53:04.240
How much more stress did I have?

53:04.240 --> 53:05.600
How many more employees did I manage?

53:05.600 --> 53:09.520
How many dinners and golf trips did I miss?

53:10.080 --> 53:14.640
And I made no extra money, like literally no extra money.

53:14.640 --> 53:17.360
I could have done the exact same thing I did the year before,

53:17.360 --> 53:18.720
and I would have made the same amount of money,

53:18.720 --> 53:20.000
and I would have had 50% more time.

53:21.200 --> 53:24.320
So guys, I've heard Hermosy talk about this.

53:24.320 --> 53:27.920
He talks about this concept of the woman in the red dress from The Matrix,

53:27.920 --> 53:33.200
where it distracts you, and it's the very thing that will kill you.

53:33.760 --> 53:37.200
And he says that as you get bigger, as you grow,

53:37.760 --> 53:42.400
the woman in the red dress becomes more attractive, becomes more sexy.

53:42.400 --> 53:44.000
And I will tell you that that is true,

53:44.000 --> 53:44.640
because guess what?

53:44.640 --> 53:49.280
When I did it in 2021, I now had 30 clients.

53:49.280 --> 53:54.000
And the idea of offering a new service was way more attractive to me.

53:54.000 --> 53:58.240
And it was actually in 2021 that I did offer the Go High Level White Label,

53:58.240 --> 53:59.600
and it sounded like such a good idea,

53:59.600 --> 54:02.240
because now I have 30 clients instead of 8 or 10,

54:03.120 --> 54:05.200
and it became more attractive, right?

54:05.200 --> 54:09.520
But guys, all that it was was a freaking distraction, okay?

54:10.560 --> 54:13.280
So I want to tell you guys really quick in these last few minutes

54:13.280 --> 54:16.160
is how I think you should properly do it, okay?

54:16.960 --> 54:20.480
Number one is you need to make sure that your core business,

54:20.480 --> 54:21.760
your lead generation business,

54:21.760 --> 54:24.240
again, for those of you that are trying to get out of your job,

54:24.240 --> 54:26.080
I'm not necessarily talking directly to you,

54:26.080 --> 54:31.280
because I would rather you do SEO to get out of your job and buy your time back,

54:32.160 --> 54:35.040
and then do lead gen to replace that,

54:35.040 --> 54:37.920
then I would have you stuck in your job.

54:37.920 --> 54:41.840
But for everybody else, if you're just building lead gen

54:41.840 --> 54:43.920
and you're okay in your job and you have a pretty good schedule

54:43.920 --> 54:46.160
or you work from home or you don't mind it,

54:46.160 --> 54:51.120
I would highly recommend you just build your income on lead gen only.

54:51.920 --> 54:56.720
And basically what I'm saying is until that money,

54:56.720 --> 55:00.480
that first money pays your bills and a lot more,

55:01.360 --> 55:03.440
like it's spitting off cash,

55:03.440 --> 55:05.200
it's to the point where mine is right now,

55:05.200 --> 55:07.680
where in the last six business days,

55:08.560 --> 55:09.920
we've gotten two deals.

55:09.920 --> 55:13.520
I haven't talked to the clients.

55:13.520 --> 55:14.800
I don't know the client's names.

55:15.280 --> 55:16.640
I can't even remember the second one.

55:16.640 --> 55:19.360
Francesca got like a small $300 a month deal.

55:19.920 --> 55:24.480
I have no idea where it's at, what kind of service it's in,

55:24.480 --> 55:25.680
what the business owner's name is.

55:25.680 --> 55:27.360
I don't know what state it's in,

55:27.360 --> 55:29.280
because I don't have to touch it anymore.

55:29.280 --> 55:30.320
Francesca does it.

55:30.320 --> 55:34.560
The only thing I have to do is approve when we spend money on new stuff.

55:35.520 --> 55:38.240
That's the only thing that I really do in the business anymore.

55:38.240 --> 55:41.840
Until you've gotten to like that point, then don't touch it.

55:42.960 --> 55:43.840
Now, that's number one.

55:43.840 --> 55:49.760
Number two, I personally think that you shouldn't go chasing second money.

55:50.560 --> 55:54.320
I think that with second money, when it starts to come to you,

55:55.280 --> 55:56.480
that's when it's the time.

55:57.200 --> 56:00.320
When second money comes to you, not one time, not two times,

56:00.320 --> 56:02.800
but like five times, that's when you start to go,

56:02.800 --> 56:04.240
all right, I have an opportunity here.

56:04.240 --> 56:05.600
Let me give you an example.

56:05.600 --> 56:07.280
I didn't start digital landlords.

56:07.280 --> 56:12.000
I didn't start this program until 2021 and at the end of 2021.

56:12.000 --> 56:14.560
And guys, it was literally, I'm not saying it was by force,

56:14.560 --> 56:15.680
because I clearly chose it.

56:15.680 --> 56:17.120
And obviously, you guys can do the math.

56:17.120 --> 56:20.480
There's great cash in it, and I'm never going to hide that.

56:20.480 --> 56:22.240
But I didn't seek it out.

56:22.240 --> 56:23.760
I was completely content.

56:23.760 --> 56:25.120
Of course, I thought it was a good idea.

56:25.120 --> 56:27.040
Of course, I knew that it would be a good idea.

56:27.040 --> 56:32.960
But guys, I had five, sometimes 10 people a day reaching out to me,

56:32.960 --> 56:36.880
asking me questions about how I was doing what I was doing,

56:36.880 --> 56:40.000
asking me specifics, asking me if I could jump on a call with them,

56:40.000 --> 56:42.800
asking if they could pick my brain.

56:42.800 --> 56:44.800
And I'm not saying this to sound cool.

56:44.800 --> 56:50.400
I'm saying it because I was trying to just send people videos and answer questions.

56:50.400 --> 56:54.000
I had this opportunity knocking at my door,

56:54.000 --> 56:56.320
and that's when I realized it was the time.

56:57.120 --> 56:59.600
So the way to do it is get your first money,

57:00.480 --> 57:03.680
humming like a machine, firing at all cylinders,

57:03.760 --> 57:08.080
making sure that you're basically completely detached from it.

57:08.080 --> 57:10.960
And then the second money is knocking at your door.

57:11.680 --> 57:15.040
And then, guys, what I would highly recommend is if it's not something

57:15.040 --> 57:16.960
that you have to be involved in, obviously in this,

57:16.960 --> 57:19.680
I have to be heavily involved because it's my process.

57:19.680 --> 57:21.280
It's my face on this thing.

57:21.280 --> 57:22.800
But let's say it's SEO.

57:22.800 --> 57:26.320
Let's say for some reason you got people just knocking at your door for SEO

57:26.320 --> 57:29.200
because all of your clients are so impressed with how you rank

57:29.200 --> 57:30.640
and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

57:30.640 --> 57:33.920
You just have droves of people asking you for SEO.

57:34.480 --> 57:38.160
If that's the case, because SEO is not scalable

57:38.160 --> 57:39.840
and you're going to have to add new employees,

57:39.840 --> 57:42.480
you're going to have to add new systems and processes

57:42.480 --> 57:44.560
and all this different stuff to scale,

57:45.200 --> 57:47.360
guys, what I would highly recommend you doing

57:47.360 --> 57:49.440
is finding a strategic partnership

57:49.440 --> 57:52.080
that you can literally just refer the business to

57:52.080 --> 57:53.440
and never talk to them again.

57:55.440 --> 57:59.280
This is what I did in 2020 is I got rid of my SEO,

57:59.280 --> 58:01.040
which made up almost half of my business,

58:01.040 --> 58:02.800
about 4,000 out of the 10,000.

58:04.960 --> 58:06.400
I created the partnership.

58:06.400 --> 58:07.440
I went to someone and said,

58:07.440 --> 58:10.240
what if you start your own SEO company?

58:10.240 --> 58:11.120
Here's the split.

58:11.840 --> 58:13.280
I don't even want my name on the company.

58:13.280 --> 58:15.680
I just want you to give me 50% of the net profit.

58:15.680 --> 58:16.720
I don't want to talk to them.

58:16.720 --> 58:17.520
I'll sign the deals.

58:17.520 --> 58:18.800
I'll refer you to business.

58:18.800 --> 58:19.360
What do you think?

58:19.360 --> 58:20.000
They said yes.

58:20.800 --> 58:23.840
So when I'm talking about making seven figures in 2020,

58:23.840 --> 58:25.520
that had nothing to do with SEO.

58:26.080 --> 58:29.680
I made $6,000 to $10,000 a month that year,

58:30.800 --> 58:35.280
and that was completely on just basically commissions.

58:35.280 --> 58:37.360
That was basically on splits.

58:37.360 --> 58:38.320
I didn't talk to the clients.

58:38.320 --> 58:39.120
I didn't deal with the clients.

58:39.120 --> 58:40.480
I didn't do anything like that,

58:40.480 --> 58:42.320
and that wasn't included in that seven figures.

58:42.320 --> 58:44.240
That was completely separate money.

58:44.240 --> 58:45.520
That was just gravy money.

58:45.520 --> 58:48.560
That was blow on golf money.

58:48.560 --> 58:49.760
That had nothing to do.

58:49.760 --> 58:51.520
So I didn't have to deal with it.

58:51.520 --> 58:53.840
I didn't, and it's not even that I didn't have to do the service,

58:53.920 --> 58:56.000
but I didn't have to deal with the headache or the bandwidth

58:56.000 --> 58:59.760
or my customers being pissed off that I wasn't ranking.

58:59.760 --> 59:01.040
It wasn't even attached to me.

59:01.040 --> 59:03.280
They called me and tried to complain about it.

59:03.280 --> 59:04.880
See, I'm like, that's not my deal, dude.

59:04.880 --> 59:05.440
That's him.

59:06.320 --> 59:07.280
That's not my business.

59:07.280 --> 59:10.880
I just told you he's good, and I'll text him for you,

59:10.880 --> 59:12.560
but that has nothing to do with me, sir.

59:14.160 --> 59:16.240
And I would text him like, yo, this person's unhappy.

59:16.240 --> 59:17.040
Can you deal with it?

59:17.840 --> 59:19.920
That's the way I think you do second money.

59:19.920 --> 59:21.600
That's the way that I found that works.

59:22.160 --> 59:23.520
Get your business firing.

59:24.640 --> 59:26.560
Wait till the second money is knocking at your door

59:27.280 --> 59:28.880
and then find a strategic partnership.

59:28.880 --> 59:31.680
Now, in the case of this program, it is scalable.

59:32.640 --> 59:33.920
I can create the videos.

59:33.920 --> 59:36.160
I could create the training, and then I could sell the training.

59:36.160 --> 59:39.280
Obviously, we have to do the support and all this different stuff,

59:39.280 --> 59:40.800
but I've committed to doing this.

59:40.800 --> 59:41.600
I figured this out.

59:42.400 --> 59:43.440
It's been a work in progress.

59:43.440 --> 59:44.320
It is a work in progress.

59:44.320 --> 59:47.200
It's a big commitment, but the opportunity was knocking at my door.

59:47.840 --> 59:49.680
That's how I think you do second money.

59:49.680 --> 59:52.080
And guys, I want you to remember, for those of you that are like,

59:52.080 --> 59:53.360
I'm going to go start a court.

59:53.360 --> 59:55.200
I did this in 2016.

59:56.960 --> 01:00:03.920
Nine months of 2017, I got distracted, but I did part of 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021.

01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:11.200
I did it for five and a half years and made over a million dollars two years in a row

01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:13.520
before I even thought about this.

01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:15.760
So for those of you that are like,

01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:19.440
I'm going to go rip some all-encompassing services.

01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:22.080
I'm going to go do the full-stack marketing agency.

01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:23.760
Could be a stupid, okay?

01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:27.680
So guys, here's my challenge to you guys is get focused.

01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:28.960
Get stupid.

01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:29.760
Get simple.

01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:31.360
What's this kiss?

01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:32.960
Keep it stupid simple, right?

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:34.960
Keep it stupid simple.

01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:36.480
Focus on one service.

01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:38.960
Stop doing second money.

01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:44.400
One service, one offering, one niche, one deal structure, one sales process,

01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:46.240
and a bunch of money.

01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:47.840
That's what I want to recommend to you guys.

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:49.920
That's from experience, not from theory.

01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:51.200
Thanks for being on the call, guys.

01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:52.480
I will see you guys next week.

01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:52.960
Thanks, Aaron.

01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:53.840
All right.

01:00:53.840 --> 01:01:02.560
Take care.
