Robert said, he's got clicks, but no phone calls.

00:02.280 --> 00:03.120
Can you assist?

00:03.120 --> 00:08.120
So guys, one thing I would love to just try

00:08.160 --> 00:11.780
and just reiterate that something that I've tried

00:11.780 --> 00:14.320
to really focus on is try to just,

00:14.320 --> 00:16.120
whenever you have an issue in your business,

00:16.120 --> 00:19.400
try to just use your intuition and think, okay.

00:19.400 --> 00:21.480
And by the way, this goes for anything.

00:21.480 --> 00:24.520
If you're not, if your business owners aren't closing,

00:24.520 --> 00:26.780
but you're getting a bunch of people to a closing call,

00:26.780 --> 00:29.440
then you could use the same exact logic, okay?

00:29.480 --> 00:31.280
But with this situation, you're like, okay,

00:31.280 --> 00:33.360
I'm getting clicks, but no phone calls.

00:33.360 --> 00:36.800
So that means that people are clicking on my ads

00:36.800 --> 00:38.320
and I'm getting no phone calls.

00:38.320 --> 00:41.120
So well, then you start kind of digging deeper.

00:41.120 --> 00:43.160
You go, all right, well, assuming that these people

00:43.160 --> 00:46.120
are visiting my website, then that would mean

00:46.120 --> 00:50.160
that I'm either getting the wrong people to my website,

00:50.160 --> 00:52.840
right, because they're just not, they're not ready to buy.

00:52.840 --> 00:57.460
They're not ready to call for an estimate.

00:57.460 --> 00:58.880
So that could be number one.

00:58.920 --> 01:01.720
The other thing is I have the right people,

01:01.720 --> 01:04.800
but my landing page isn't converting, right?

01:04.800 --> 01:06.160
So that's what you have to look at

01:06.160 --> 01:08.800
and you have to kind of be logical about it, okay?

01:08.800 --> 01:12.520
So what I would recommend is there's a couple

01:12.520 --> 01:14.320
of different things that you can do.

01:15.440 --> 01:18.960
If you have an idea that maybe your website's

01:18.960 --> 01:20.960
not converting, you can go,

01:20.960 --> 01:22.600
there's a software called Hotjar.

01:22.600 --> 01:24.040
You can install Hotjar on your,

01:24.040 --> 01:24.960
and there's other ones too,

01:24.960 --> 01:27.060
but you can install Hotjar on your website.

01:27.060 --> 01:29.460
You can track and look at what people,

01:29.460 --> 01:30.480
you know, when they come to the page,

01:30.480 --> 01:31.320
what are they doing?

01:31.320 --> 01:32.220
Are they scrolling below the fold?

01:32.220 --> 01:33.060
Are they doing this?

01:33.060 --> 01:33.900
Are they doing that?

01:33.900 --> 01:34.720
Whatever.

01:34.720 --> 01:35.560
So that's an idea.

01:35.560 --> 01:37.100
If you think it's a conversion issue,

01:37.100 --> 01:41.340
if you think it's maybe the wrong type of customer,

01:41.340 --> 01:43.100
or you think they're clicking on the ad

01:43.100 --> 01:44.860
and they're not going to the website, for example,

01:44.860 --> 01:47.420
I know sometimes I used to think it was my competitors,

01:47.420 --> 01:50.180
maybe you could go and you could set up your analytics.

01:50.180 --> 01:52.500
You could see, are you getting, you know,

01:52.500 --> 01:54.260
how much traffic are you actually getting?

01:54.260 --> 01:55.100
Is it increasing?

01:55.340 --> 01:57.820
Is it lining up with how many clicks you're getting?

01:57.820 --> 01:59.660
And you just kind of have to dissect it from there

01:59.660 --> 02:01.660
and you just have to do a process of elimination.

02:01.660 --> 02:04.640
But if you guys are using the core keywords,

02:04.640 --> 02:06.620
you guys are following the training,

02:06.620 --> 02:09.660
most likely you have the right traffic going to your website,

02:09.660 --> 02:11.860
which means that you have a conversion issue,

02:11.860 --> 02:15.220
which then I would go, hey, is your website,

02:15.220 --> 02:18.340
you know, something that's actually converting,

02:18.340 --> 02:19.300
is it user friendly?

02:19.300 --> 02:21.300
Is it something that is scaring people off?

02:21.300 --> 02:23.060
Is the number easy to find?

02:23.060 --> 02:24.540
Is the quote form easy to find?

02:24.540 --> 02:26.820
Or are you burying the stuff at the bottom,

02:26.820 --> 02:27.660
making it difficult?

02:27.660 --> 02:29.580
So you just kind of have to use your intuition there.

02:29.580 --> 02:31.300
Go look at some of our example websites.

02:31.300 --> 02:33.620
You can go look at BentonvilleConcrete.com.

02:33.620 --> 02:34.900
It doesn't have to be complicated.

02:34.900 --> 02:36.140
It's very simple.

02:36.140 --> 02:38.860
I promise you guys, even the ugly websites convert.

02:38.860 --> 02:41.020
So that's kind of how I would attack that.

02:41.020 --> 02:43.060
But that's a really good question, Robert.
