1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,960
Let me see.

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:03,120
There we go.

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,520
Okay, I don't see the Facebook comments for some reason,

4
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:11,520
but Jason, Aaron, can you kind of check that out

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,080
as we have questions, comments come in?

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,080
Can you let me know?

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,360
Yeah, for sure.

8
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,800
I will say that one comment I saw on the teaser post you did

9
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,640
that Heather mentioned that she's excited for this live

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,920
because this is one of the bigger things

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,440
that she sees as a roadblock now for her

12
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,200
is qualifying business owners.

13
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,240
Yeah.

14
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,440
So let's do this.

15
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,760
And by the way, I'm gonna give,

16
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,960
I'm gonna give Aaron, I'm gonna give you co-host

17
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,600
if you're not already because in case my internet,

18
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,200
sometimes it's shaky here, I don't know why.

19
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,840
So let's, I wanna say a few things

20
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,120
and then I'm gonna have Porter,

21
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,840
I'll ask Porter a couple of questions, you as well,

22
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,600
and then we'll go into some Q&A stuff, okay?

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,440
Does that sound good, Aaron?

24
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,240
You can hear me though, right?

25
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,720
Yeah, sounds good.

26
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:06,720
Beautiful, all right, so what I learned

27
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,200
and I'm gonna kind of go back to when I first started,

28
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,840
I remember back in 2016, first deal, towing deal,

29
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,720
of course you guys have probably heard the story,

30
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,280
I did everything wrong, I got lucky,

31
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,040
I picked the right area on accident,

32
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,360
the niche wasn't the greatest, but I still got the deal.

33
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,360
And I remember that that client was the biggest pain

34
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,520
in the butt of anything.

35
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,560
Now, yes, it was a $600 deal, yes, it was my first deal,

36
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,120
yes, I was excited about that more

37
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,720
than probably any other deal that I got,

38
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:46,720
but I had to work so much for that deal to get paid,

39
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,680
it was unbelievable.

40
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,840
And so I want you guys to know that when you get

41
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,480
that first deal, Porter, I know you've dealt with this,

42
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,360
Aaron, I'm sure you've dealt with this,

43
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,240
it happens, you're excited, you wanna get that deal,

44
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,720
that first person that talks to you,

45
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,720
that says they'll take your leads,

46
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,640
you kind of throw yourselves at them

47
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,040
because you're like, oh my gosh, this is actually working,

48
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:13,040
somebody's interested, and it takes you going down the road

49
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,880
and having the deal go sideways,

50
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,560
having the business owner not pay you,

51
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,800
having the business owner not be able to close deals.

52
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,760
The worst though is sending the leads,

53
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,560
the business owners, three, four, five leads,

54
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,480
and then getting ghosted because all they wanted

55
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,120
was freebies, right?

56
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,200
There's all these variables.

57
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,120
So guys, I've said this a few times before

58
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,440
and I want you guys to remember this,

59
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,440
just because you can get money from a person,

60
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,160
just because you can close a deal,

61
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,200
just because somebody will say yes,

62
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,200
does not mean that you should agree to it, okay?

63
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,200
It's the same thing in the free Facebook group,

64
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,040
I tell people all the time, and in this group as well,

65
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,920
just because somebody is willing to give you advice

66
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,400
does not mean that you should take it, okay?

67
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,040
Just because someone's willing to pay you

68
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,280
just does not mean that you should take it.

69
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,200
This is something that I live by,

70
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,640
this is including in this group,

71
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,400
there are people that we have gotten on the phone with,

72
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,560
they have wanted to join this group,

73
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,840
they're interested in starting a business,

74
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,200
and we can literally tell they are probably

75
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,560
not gonna finish paying the tuition,

76
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,040
they're gonna be a complete problem,

77
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,080
way more questions than, you know,

78
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,000
they're gonna take more than they're gonna give,

79
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,680
and sometimes it's just not worth it.

80
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,400
So, we wanna talk about qualifying,

81
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,440
and guys, I know that a lot of times,

82
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,880
again, during those first few deals,

83
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,000
it's almost like you're willing to do anything,

84
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,960
it's like, well, at least it's money, right?

85
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,120
That's not true, okay?

86
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,280
My first deal I got, this guy named,

87
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,760
what was his, I don't even remember his name,

88
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,760
but anyway, he was a towing guy,

89
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,600
I closed the deal in person,

90
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,240
and guys, I fought like crazy to get this money every month,

91
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,400
and eventually, it was just not worth it

92
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,960
after some period of time,

93
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,800
and I'm gonna contrast that,

94
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:02,040
I got a deal with a company back in 2019,

95
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,000
was it 2019 or 2018?

96
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,400
One of those years, I think it might've been 2019,

97
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,240
and then it bled into 2020,

98
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:16,160
this client, I sent them literally one lead,

99
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,920
they escalated me to the marketing director,

100
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,240
it was a huge company that owned another company,

101
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,760
and I got to the top of the company,

102
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,680
and guys, there was a month or two in there

103
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,000
that they cut me a check for $30,000,

104
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,240
just how big this client got,

105
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,880
and the most amazing part is,

106
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,760
this was the most low maintenance of all the clients.

107
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,480
Can you guys hear me still?

108
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,800
Okay, it's like, it sounds funny,

109
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,960
but usually, the bigger the client,

110
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,120
the easier they are to maintain, okay?

111
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:54,000
Francesca just landed us a deal for $7,500 per month,

112
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,720
I have not communicated with that business.

113
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,080
Personally, I have not communicated with that business,

114
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,840
I'm not interested in communicating that business.

115
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,840
They are low maintenance, yes, we check in once a week,

116
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,760
but it's worth it, 7,500 bucks a month,

117
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,560
so anyway, let's talk about qualifying.

118
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,560
Porter, I know for you, you landed a few deals,

119
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,280
you got excited, and you were snagging deals,

120
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,880
and I think you were kind of just working with anybody,

121
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,240
because you were just excited,

122
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,200
and then you ended up losing two or three of those deals,

123
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,640
so what did you learn throughout that process?

124
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,320
Dude, it was all, I was calling the wrong people,

125
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,320
first of all, even though I know I know

126
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:35,280
what I should be doing, I still wanna, I get lazy,

127
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,520
I'm like, oh, I've called everyone on my list,

128
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,280
I don't wanna go write another list,

129
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,740
so I start calling people on Facebook,

130
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:45,580
I start calling people that aren't running ads,

131
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,780
and I don't know why I thought that I could be the one

132
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:52,020
to just make those sales, but I'm not, and they're cheap,

133
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:55,420
everyone that's not doing that is not gonna pay

134
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,660
for the service, so I was calling the wrong people,

135
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:01,260
and I really don't think, the first two deals that I landed,

136
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,500
I was asking the right questions,

137
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,780
I was bringing up the objections before,

138
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,180
I was talking about the contract,

139
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,940
I was talking about how the deal would look

140
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,420
before I got on the call,

141
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:14,020
and there was just some things that I just was muffled,

142
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:18,060
I was just like, oh, I did that, but he already knows,

143
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,740
but he doesn't, you have to bring it up,

144
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:22,340
you have to ask him, and so those were some things

145
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:26,540
that I have caught myself, and even just my energy of,

146
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,500
being excited about the business model,

147
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,440
I was definitely a little bit under the weather,

148
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,240
I wasn't as excited, I was probably making it seem

149
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,260
like he wasn't gonna get very many leads,

150
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:39,620
I was trying to downplay it too much,

151
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,900
so there were some things I didn't do,

152
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,340
but I do think the questions that you ask

153
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,340
are very important, and if they say,

154
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,420
me and Aaron talked about this,

155
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:49,900
but if they say yes, yes, yes, you should be worried,

156
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,500
because most of the time, there's gonna be a few questions

157
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,220
that come up beforehand, I mean, occasionally,

158
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,620
you'll get one that's like, hey, that all makes sense,

159
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,860
let's work together, but most of the time,

160
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:02,100
the ones that are actually serious about it

161
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,280
have genuine questions from the beginning,

162
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,100
and they're asking you, and those are the ones

163
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,780
that are gonna stick with you longer.

164
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:12,700
If it sounds too good to be true, it usually is,

165
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,300
that's what I've learned, okay?

166
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,460
Another principle that I've learned, guys, is,

167
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,140
so I wanna come back to this port to remind me,

168
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,580
I wanna come back to talking to people

169
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,740
that are already paying for ads,

170
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,860
so don't let me forget that, but I wanna mention something,

171
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,660
guys, this is the same thing that I learned

172
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:29,940
doing door-to-door sales, is if I was on the door,

173
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:34,140
and so I looked at the sale as two parts,

174
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:37,580
the door approach and the inside the house and the clothes,

175
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,900
now, granted, there was actually three parts,

176
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,500
there was the door approach, the presentation,

177
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,380
and the clothes, so let's say there's three parts.

178
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,500
What I learned, guys, is that if it was easy for me

179
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:51,060
to get in the house, no objections, whatever, boom,

180
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,780
they was like, yep, come in,

181
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:55,860
I was gonna be up for a tough close.

182
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,940
If the door approach was tough, and I had to overcome

183
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:01,420
one or two objections before they let me in the house,

184
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,860
there was a good chance I was gonna get that deal,

185
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:07,340
and so back to that, I bet you every single person

186
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:11,300
out here that's talked to, made at least 50 calls,

187
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,100
we've all dealt with a business owner,

188
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,820
like Porter's talking about, yeah, yeah, yeah,

189
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,060
that sounds good, sounds good, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

190
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,700
and you're just like, yep, and it's like,

191
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,020
it can't be that easy, it's not that easy.

192
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,820
If it's too good to be true, it probably is, okay?

193
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,420
If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is,

194
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:28,540
so back to what Porter was talking about, guys,

195
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:32,300
in the training, we talk about this,

196
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:35,700
in the training, we talk about when you build your list,

197
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:40,700
why not make it half as easy, twice as easy, half as hard?

198
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:44,460
Why try to, if you're calling just any random Joe,

199
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:47,660
you are having to sell them on the idea of paying for leads,

200
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:52,660
paying for marketing, and on you, right?

201
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,700
If you are selling to people

202
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,700
who are already paying for leads,

203
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,020
you only have to sell them on you.

204
00:08:59,020 --> 00:08:59,980
You don't have to sell them

205
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,500
on why they should be paying for it.

206
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:06,500
So it is, even if it takes longer to find an area

207
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,140
with business owners that are already paying,

208
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:12,780
it's a much easier, more logical, quicker sale,

209
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:13,820
because all you're doing is saying,

210
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,740
look, you've already tried Home Advisor, dude,

211
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:16,660
if it's not working,

212
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,340
what makes you think it's gonna change?

213
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:21,420
Why don't you try this with me, right?

214
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,140
They're already in the mindset of the,

215
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:25,220
hey, I gotta spend money to make money.

216
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,860
It doesn't even mean you need to take the money

217
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:29,140
from the Home Advisor budget necessarily,

218
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:32,820
but there's somebody that's willing to spend money, okay?

219
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,140
So here's a question that I wanna ask.

220
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,300
I'm gonna ask Porter and Aaron,

221
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,980
cause I'm sure that somebody is gonna ask this

222
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,140
or thinking this.

223
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:42,300
Aaron, you go to an area, everything looks good,

224
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:46,100
juicy area, good lead flow, low competition,

225
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:50,940
and there's only like, let's say three, four people

226
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,620
that are paying for ads,

227
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,660
paying for some kind of lead generation.

228
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,480
What do you do?

229
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:01,360
If I only see three or four people that are paying for leads,

230
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,800
I would not go into that area.

231
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,280
Porter, what about you?

232
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,240
The reason being-

233
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,400
Oh, finished, finished, finished.

234
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,400
Oh yeah, no, I get it.

235
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,600
So this is especially if you're starting out,

236
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,380
like if you're not at 10K and I'm not at 10K,

237
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,600
if you're not at 10K,

238
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,560
these are not deals you should be pushing.

239
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,380
Yeah, for sure.

240
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,520
Like if you've got the sales experience,

241
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,360
you got the conviction,

242
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,480
you got the, like your systems are just dialed in,

243
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,120
yeah, you could be, you might get that work,

244
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,820
but that'd be like a higher skill deal to land.

245
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,240
And again, you could land it,

246
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,720
but you'll most likely get a better bang for your buck

247
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,160
just going with an area of more people to prospect.

248
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,640
Facts, yep.

249
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,880
There's nothing worse than finally getting leads

250
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,800
and then just not having prospects anymore.

251
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,800
It's rare, but it happens and it sucks.

252
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,320
100%, 100%.

253
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,160
Porter?

254
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:54,200
I think a lot of times if the metrics look good,

255
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,080
I think all of us are like, dude, I don't care.

256
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,680
Like there's gotta be a business owner.

257
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,020
Like we all kind of jump on that city that looks good.

258
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,280
So like if you do,

259
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,080
there's probably some of you that are doing this right now,

260
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,360
like go check and see if people are running ads.

261
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,040
And if that is the case, I mean,

262
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,240
you know your Google ads are your number one,

263
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,000
your home advisor and your energy list

264
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,720
is probably your two and three.

265
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,140
And then anything after that,

266
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:17,080
like you could dip into your Facebook groups,

267
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:17,900
which I'm telling you,

268
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,540
you're scraping the barrel.

269
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,380
Like I've done that before and it's not worth it

270
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:24,500
because I just lost two deals and that's exactly what I did.

271
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,820
But if you're not doing that,

272
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,460
you could also go to neighboring cities.

273
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,580
If you're in a suburb area,

274
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:31,500
you could go to a neighboring city that's close to it

275
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,940
and search it.

276
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:35,340
And maybe there's people running ads like 20 minutes away,

277
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:39,140
which people love to travel if they got the work.

278
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,540
But again, with Aaron,

279
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,100
I think if you want to start off right,

280
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,020
you don't necessarily want to target those areas.

281
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,720
But again, I'm guilty of it.

282
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,320
I still go into those areas sometimes

283
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,720
because I'm like, dude, this is a golden area.

284
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,800
This looks good.

285
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,200
There's gotta be someone that wants the leads.

286
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,280
I would say if you,

287
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:59,720
I think that's a really good nuance that Aaron pointed out.

288
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,360
And I agree with what Porter saying as well,

289
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,120
that if you are not at least at a couple of deals,

290
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,200
I'd say five, 10K, make it easy on yourself.

291
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,760
Make sure there's five,

292
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,840
I'd say maybe seven to 10 business owners

293
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,160
that are paying for some form of advertising,

294
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,680
whether it's, you know, ideally Google ads,

295
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,580
then we go with HomeAdvisor, Andy's List, et cetera.

296
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,200
Now, when, you know, after you've closed a bunch of deals,

297
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,300
you're at 20K, 30K, 40K, there were areas,

298
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,880
there was like two people that were paying for ads.

299
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:35,140
I was going into that area because I knew my pitch so well.

300
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,360
I had so much momentum.

301
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,280
I had so many examples of, and better yet,

302
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,840
it was like, I had franchised,

303
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,200
people in franchises that were the same.

304
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,840
Like I knew I was gonna get the deal,

305
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,520
but I was in that niche.

306
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,740
I was the expert in that niche.

307
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:48,600
And so it's a little bit different.

308
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,160
So if you guys are brand new, make it easy on yourself.

309
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,080
Go into an area that has as many business owners

310
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,680
as possible paying for some form of ads.

311
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,160
Now, one more thing I wanna cover

312
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,820
before we get into some of the Q&A stuff is,

313
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:06,800
one, like for me, any form of paying for leads

314
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,180
is better than none, but Google ads,

315
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:13,780
the reason I like Google ads people the best

316
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:16,820
is because they're usually spending the most money.

317
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:20,280
And this is a question I hear people ask all the time.

318
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,800
Well, why would they spend money with you

319
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,300
when they're already paying for Google ads?

320
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,220
Okay?

321
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:30,180
Aaron smiling because he can literally speak just like me.

322
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,380
Aaron, I know you're gonna say the perfect answer.

323
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,820
Why is that?

324
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:37,260
Why would they still spend money with you?

325
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,020
There's a couple of reasons.

326
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,900
One is it's better to have two fishing poles

327
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:41,740
on the pond than one,

328
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,620
because you're gonna catch more fish.

329
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,340
Number two, just because they're getting clicks

330
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,860
doesn't mean they're getting leads.

331
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,540
They could be targeting,

332
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,300
they have all their targeting settings off

333
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,140
for what they want.

334
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:55,520
They could have a landing page that doesn't convert,

335
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,140
let alone, even if those things are true,

336
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:01,620
again, what we're doing is if the ROI is still good,

337
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,660
yeah, maybe their ROI isn't as high

338
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:07,020
as if they get it from their own marketing source

339
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,480
that they manage themselves,

340
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,520
but it still makes sense if they make money from.

341
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,380
So yeah, I used to think that too though.

342
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,960
It's a fair question, but that's,

343
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,720
if you guys are thinking that you're assuming

344
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,360
that just because someone is running ads,

345
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,000
you think they're getting leads.

346
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,360
Google ads is to get clicks, not leads,

347
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,360
that you pay for clicks, not for leads.

348
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,960
The one advantage Home Advisor has

349
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,640
is you're paying for leads, not clicks,

350
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,780
except for you gotta share them.

351
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:33,740
Guys, can't you see how much better of a service it is

352
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:34,980
that we offer?

353
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,600
Like it's, we're taking the good part of Home Advisor,

354
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,440
we're taking the good part of Google,

355
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,840
and we're giving both to them.

356
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,560
It's exclusive because that's kind of what Google does,

357
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,680
and it's leads, which is what Home Advisor does.

358
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,520
And it's, they don't have to share it.

359
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,160
I don't know, sometimes you have to go

360
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,880
and you have to like put yourself in the shoes

361
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,980
of the business owner and think about,

362
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,240
imagine paying for Home Advisor.

363
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,080
Imagine as an agency owner,

364
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,240
you're paying Home Advisor for leads, right?

365
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,800
And they send you a lead,

366
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,760
and that lead is getting,

367
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,820
they're sending that same lead to five other agencies,

368
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:06,660
right?

369
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:07,480
And guess what?

370
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,200
One of these clients are looking for it,

371
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,720
most likely is the cheapest price.

372
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,120
And you're like, dude, I don't want to compete on price.

373
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,240
It's not worth it for me.

374
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,680
And then somebody else calls you and they're like,

375
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,320
yo, I'm gonna send you these jobs.

376
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,040
You're the only one I'm gonna send them to,

377
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,040
that's your job to, like it's yours to lose,

378
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,860
and I'm only gonna work with you.

379
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,520
Dude, it's an easy sell.

380
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,720
It's a very easy sell.

381
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:32,720
So anyway, that's the biggest points I wanna cover.

382
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,040
Guys, make it easy on yourself.

383
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,300
The easier you make it on yourself,

384
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:38,980
the more likely you're gonna be to actually,

385
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,380
you know, just get the deal.

386
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:43,820
And again, I know when you're starting out,

387
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:46,620
it's easy to wanna jump into that first deal,

388
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,660
find that first city and get started.

389
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,540
And I love that energy.

390
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,380
I love that energy.

391
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:54,820
But guys, now that we have freaking rank and run engine

392
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:58,920
where you can do a due diligence in like 13 seconds,

393
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,880
you guys should be tearing through areas.

394
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,660
You should be picking a niche

395
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,800
and you should be picking a hundred cities

396
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,580
and you should do the first 50 yourself,

397
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:13,180
create a process, get an outsourcer from, you know,

398
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:16,580
onlinejobs.ph and you should be cranking

399
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:19,520
a hundred due diligence a day to find that city.

400
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:23,940
And I would rather go a week to find the best city

401
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:27,380
and, you know, maybe it takes you three extra days

402
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,220
than what you were gonna do

403
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,900
if you would have went with that okay city.

404
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,020
Cause if you guys can find that right city and niche,

405
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:35,140
dude, it makes every freaking thing easier

406
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:37,740
and it's exciting, it's fun.

407
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,860
So anyway, I can't stress enough about due diligence.

408
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,180
And I think sometimes we're like,

409
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,540
oh, I'm doing something wrong.

410
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,620
But as Porter said in the beginning,

411
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,980
most likely you're just talking to the wrong people.

412
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:50,780
You could say the right thing to the wrong person

413
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,140
and it's not gonna land.

414
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:55,500
Makes sense?

415
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,340
So true.

416
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:59,180
And you can say the wrong things to the right person

417
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,400
and it might still work.

418
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,240
That's the truth.

419
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,840
So I swear it's more about the person.

420
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,800
So finding those right areas, number one,

421
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,580
talking to the right people.

422
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:11,960
And then I guess the last thing

423
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:15,520
that we can talk about really quick is don't be so excited

424
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,560
and salesy when someone says yes,

425
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,960
be a little hesitant, pull back a little bit,

426
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,800
be willing to lose the deal.

427
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,040
If it feels a little off, be willing to say,

428
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,960
hey, whoa, whoa, just so I can check

429
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,280
before I send you this lead,

430
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,140
but by the way is digital gold.

431
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,820
I just wanna make sure you're hungry to grow here, sir.

432
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:35,420
Cause I can only work with one company per area.

433
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:39,900
I've had quite a bit of interest here in Tucson.

434
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:44,660
And before I dedicate and kind of like marry myself to you,

435
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:47,380
like, can you just give me a little bit of a feedback

436
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,620
as to why, how I'm convinced me

437
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,980
that you're serious about growing.

438
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,540
Cause I don't wanna waste my time either.

439
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:55,180
I'm running a business just like you, right?

440
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,020
Don't be afraid.

441
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,300
People are so afraid that if they say that,

442
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,900
they're gonna lose the deal.

443
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,700
All that's gonna do is help you get the deal.

444
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,640
It's gonna build trust

445
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,460
because you're not so freaking desperate to get that deal.

446
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:07,700
So anyway, let's go into a little bit of Q and A.

447
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,220
We can kind of mix in some other stuff

448
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,780
that comes to our minds as we go.

449
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:15,780
But guys, who you talk to is more important

450
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,820
than what you say.

451
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,000
I promise you that.

452
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,480
If you are talking to the right person that's hungry,

453
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,100
you can mess up a lot of the other stuff.

454
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,060
You're still gonna get the deal.

455
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:27,380
On the contrary, you go pick some random Joe off the street

456
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,380
that's in a Facebook group

457
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,900
that's not willing to spend 10 cents.

458
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,460
You could say all the right things.

459
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:34,260
The money's just not there or the mindset's just not there.

460
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,300
It's just not gonna work.

461
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,220
It is so important you're talking to the right people.

462
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,940
And so that's why we stress so much.

463
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:39,860
Go and sell.

464
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:42,380
That's why the module is called Selling to the Already Sold.

465
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,780
Building your list.

466
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,780
Do we have any questions so far, Aaron?

467
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,240
So we don't have any specific questions,

468
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,240
but one good comment from Brad Hardy.

469
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,420
This was in reference to the question

470
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:55,540
of why would a business wanna pay me

471
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,060
if they're already paying for Google Ads themselves.

472
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,380
But he said, they're busy doing the work.

473
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,300
They aren't watching the ads.

474
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,140
At all.

475
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,060
Bingo, like if we just zoom out,

476
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,160
sometimes we as marketers start a full-time job.

477
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,200
Sometimes we're not as focused on particular projects

478
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,580
or ad campaigns as we need to be.

479
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:11,580
So I don't know who doesn't know what we're doing.

480
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,900
So probably doesn't even wanna do it anyway

481
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,580
because they're like, they got that mental friction of like,

482
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,540
ah, I don't even know what I'm doing.

483
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,580
Why do you even bother?

484
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,660
So yeah.

485
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,500
Yep.

486
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,500
I completely agree with that.

487
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,100
You guys think for one second,

488
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,220
I mean, these people are worried about everything

489
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:29,100
from their cell phone bill to their company t-shirt,

490
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:32,300
to their insurance, to the gas.

491
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,180
What they did is they went to a conference,

492
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,380
they heard their buddy.

493
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,940
If they were lucky, they hired their niece

494
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,500
who's taking a marketing class in college,

495
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,500
marketing 101, learning from a professor

496
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,780
that makes like 40 grand a year, that's never done ads.

497
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,820
And that's who's running their ads.

498
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,620
So be a little persistent, guys.

499
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,940
By the way, you said there was a question

500
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,100
on the original post, Aaron?

501
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,780
Did we already answer that?

502
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,980
No, that was Heather's comment talking about,

503
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,180
she's glad this was the topic

504
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:03,100
because this is one of her main roadblocks.

505
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,540
Now with that, I would say,

506
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:07,220
and we can probably talk about this a bit as well,

507
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,420
is, and if you guys have questions,

508
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,900
you can drop them in the comments.

509
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,620
With qualifying, it seems like there's three times,

510
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:14,460
like three different stages in the sales process

511
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,580
where people fall off, like usually,

512
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,500
and this is usually because either we messed up

513
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,220
with our sales pitch or approach,

514
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,820
or because they were just a bad prospect to begin with.

515
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,540
And that's usually one of those two reasons.

516
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,180
And by the way, when in doubt, blame yourself,

517
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,500
just little advice for life.

518
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,020
But anyway, I was gonna say that,

519
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,740
it looks like she said that particularly,

520
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,180
she's struggling with, she'll cold call them,

521
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:39,020
she'll get a yes, but then they fall off

522
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,340
after she sends a few leads.

523
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,740
So it gets ghosted before the Zoom call.

524
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,900
That's like stage one of bad qualifying,

525
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,580
like second stage, it seems like,

526
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,420
would be where you hop on the Zoom close,

527
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,820
and then there's just something that they throw at,

528
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:53,540
that's just clearly they're not a good fit.

529
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,700
So I was talking with an illegal immigrant

530
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,100
on a close call at one point,

531
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,620
didn't really work out one of those things,

532
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,540
that bad qualifying job.

533
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,540
And then finally, number three would be like,

534
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,300
as you were talking to me about,

535
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,780
is if they're, you got the deal,

536
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,380
but they're just not handling the leads well,

537
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,660
because they don't, and then they just,

538
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,940
they fall off because of that, if that kind of makes sense.

539
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:14,140
So like before the call, during the call,

540
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,180
and then after the sale.

541
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,140
100%.

542
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:21,860
Let's talk about when you're getting ghosted,

543
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,820
because I know this is a pretty like,

544
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:26,820
okay, so you build the list properly, boom,

545
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,820
there's seven to 10 people, you got your pitch dialed in,

546
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:34,020
you get the deal hooked, and let's just say,

547
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,940
let's talk with, let me ask Porter first.

548
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:39,660
So Porter, you get them, they're excited,

549
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,540
yeah, sounds good, send me a couple of leads,

550
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:45,180
boom, you hang up the phone, and first scenario,

551
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,020
first circumstance is,

552
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:49,100
they never answer the phone again after that, right?

553
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,260
You haven't sent them any leads,

554
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,940
they're just kind of ghost after that.

555
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:54,220
What do you learn from that, what can we,

556
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,180
what can you do, and what can you learn from that?

557
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:58,460
If you get somebody hooked,

558
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,740
and then they never answer the phone,

559
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,420
you never send them a lead, you try to send them a lead,

560
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,180
but they just ghost.

561
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,580
This happened a lot when I first started out,

562
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:10,380
and I do, and I don't know if this is 100% the reason why,

563
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:13,580
but I felt like I was saying too much on the first call.

564
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:17,140
I was, you could always add more information to them,

565
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,080
but you can never take away.

566
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,680
So as soon as you start talking about SEO, backlinking,

567
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,680
you being able to rank these websites,

568
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,360
these guys are like, what the crap did you just say?

569
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,320
And then they get all weirded out by it.

570
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:30,000
So I felt like I was saying too much to the point where

571
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,640
I was trying to sell them on the first call,

572
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,920
and so I stopped doing that.

573
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,960
I stick exactly to the script, I do the bare minimum,

574
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,640
and then I can always add onto that.

575
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,520
But if someone was to ghost me,

576
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,240
I mean, that's where the pullback,

577
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,520
you have to be like, dude, it's okay,

578
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:48,200
I have the fear of no loss, whatever,

579
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,760
give them the pullback, say, hey, Mr. Business Owner,

580
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,240
I understand you're busy,

581
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,560
but I am trying to run a business as well.

582
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,680
If you're interested in these leads,

583
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,000
message me back by the end of the day, if not,

584
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,400
I will start sending these to somebody else, thanks.

585
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,660
Something along those lines,

586
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,880
and if they are interested, they will come back,

587
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,280
and if they're not, then just move on.

588
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,980
I wouldn't even be emotional about it.

589
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,880
100%.

590
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,720
In the training, we talk about this again.

591
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,680
Sorry to keep going back to the training,

592
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,840
but I'm gonna go back to the training, right?

593
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,560
Which is, you remember the example I used, guys,

594
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:26,000
we're selling a date or dinner, not marriage, right?

595
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,720
We're not going in, frickin' first time meeting a chick,

596
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,880
and then we're like talking about marriage.

597
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,240
That's when people get weird, dude.

598
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,720
They're like, yo, I'm never talking to this guy again,

599
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,960
right, that's weird.

600
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,600
Unless it's your boy, I'm closing that thing first date.

601
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,160
Everybody else cannot do that, okay?

602
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,160
No, I'm just kidding.

603
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,520
So I saw this happen in door-to-door sales.

604
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,760
Porter had a good point.

605
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,660
I would see this happen with new reps all the time.

606
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,280
Can you guys still hear me, by the way?

607
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,160
I was a little choppy, I'm sorry.

608
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,000
Good?

609
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,600
All right, so new reps, when they first started,

610
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,120
including me, we'd give them a pitch,

611
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,480
and it was a four-step pitch.

612
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,620
Who you are, why you're there, the deal,

613
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:08,240
and the transition, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, okay?

614
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,080
And every time you teach them the simple pitch,

615
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,300
they do it, they get in the house,

616
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,160
they get their first deal, maybe five deals,

617
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,840
and then all of a sudden they'd stop closing,

618
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,640
they'd go into slump fest, okay?

619
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,840
And every single time you would go with these reps,

620
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,720
you would find out they were just vomiting information

621
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,040
on the door, right?

622
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:29,280
They were jumping ahead and skipping steps.

623
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,960
And I like what Porter said, he's like,

624
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,120
you can always give them more, you can't take it away,

625
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,440
and there's a quote that says something like,

626
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,380
the man that doesn't talk can never be misquoted.

627
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:43,380
Just in sales, sometimes more is less and less is more.

628
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,940
Be very succinct about what you have to say,

629
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,060
but don't over-talk.

630
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,300
They start asking you questions.

631
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,220
This is common, right?

632
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,580
We get our first couple of deals,

633
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:51,780
and then the business owner's like,

634
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:52,620
dude, but just tell me,

635
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,420
how much are we looking right now?

636
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:57,420
And you're like, well, and you just drop price, right?

637
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:00,220
There's a reason we do it in the order that we do it,

638
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:02,660
or they'll say, so yeah, dude,

639
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,740
I'm happy to do 10% split.

640
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,620
And instead of you going,

641
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:08,380
hey, let's not worry about that right now,

642
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,340
and explaining it on the screencast,

643
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,740
and at the end, you're like,

644
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:14,300
nope, the only thing that I do is flat fee.

645
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,140
And then all of a sudden,

646
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,500
the business owner doesn't understand

647
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,260
why the flat fees make sense,

648
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:21,220
and all they're gonna do is just ghost you.

649
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:24,120
So do not freaking skip steps.

650
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,380
Keep it simple.

651
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:27,300
Less is more, more is less.

652
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,860
Talk to the right business owners.

653
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:33,860
You just guide them through the process, okay?

654
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:36,980
Also, let's talk about the second situation, Aaron.

655
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,580
We hook a business owner.

656
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:41,260
We, you know, sounds good to get a couple of leads.

657
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:42,620
You send them two, three leads.

658
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:44,340
This one's the most painful.

659
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:47,780
You send them two to three leads, and then they ghost you.

660
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:50,020
What can we learn from that?

661
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,620
What do you do in that situation?

662
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,460
Yeah, it seems like when that happens,

663
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,700
it's gonna either come down to

664
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:00,140
they were innately not a good fit,

665
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:03,460
or again, you messed up somewhere along the process.

666
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,340
And I'm gonna be honest,

667
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:06,880
it is really hard to tell sometimes with those situations,

668
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,260
because then you're thinking like,

669
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,420
well, did I say something?

670
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:11,340
Should I have said something else?

671
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:13,660
There's just a lot of variables at play.

672
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:18,220
And usually, obviously, you first wanna look at yourself

673
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:20,380
and, okay, did I say too much?

674
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:23,020
As you talk about your new reps, your sales guys,

675
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,300
like they're probably giving too much information.

676
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,940
So it could have been on your end.

677
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,500
And if you can't find anything,

678
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,860
then you can kind of begin to think,

679
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:33,900
okay, well, is this business owner just not a good fit?

680
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:36,700
But, and sometimes it seems like there are businesses

681
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,980
that have just been burned so bad

682
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,480
by other marketing companies

683
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,980
that they're just completely closed off.

684
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:43,900
It makes it kind of weird

685
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,580
that they would take a couple of leads,

686
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,980
but some just don't trust you.

687
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:50,100
Nothing you do can make them trust you,

688
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,100
even sometimes when giving free leads,

689
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:52,940
it almost seems like,

690
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,460
where they just don't believe it.

691
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:56,220
And again, that might be where you might need

692
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:58,260
to be a bit more persuasive in your approach, perhaps,

693
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,600
but that one's a bit more dicey.

694
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,500
Yeah.

695
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,820
And that's where the only thing you can do

696
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:05,180
in a situation like that,

697
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,600
if you're literally getting ghosted,

698
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,460
is you have to just take control back.

699
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,560
You have to take the deal off the table

700
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:14,960
and you have to have some huevos

701
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,120
and you have to send the text.

702
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,400
You have to send the text.

703
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,240
That's it.

704
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,700
So, and we've talked about length.

705
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,760
I'm sure there's three different lives we've had

706
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,020
inside this group on the pullback, right?

707
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:29,000
The breakup text, that thing is money.

708
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,600
It's a little bit scary in the beginning.

709
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,420
And it's always like, you're, you know,

710
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,060
and the best part is when sometimes you send

711
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,700
the breakup text and the business owner

712
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:39,860
tries to make you feel bad, like, well, I'm not,

713
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,620
you lost me at that.

714
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:42,460
You lost me.

715
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,820
And it's like, bro, shut up.

716
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,500
You guys have had this, right?

717
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,260
Oh yeah.

718
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,100
Yeah.

719
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:49,920
I've never done that.

720
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,580
And even if they did, those are the type of people

721
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:52,960
that cancel after week three

722
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,780
because the leads were slow that week.

723
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:55,820
Yeah.

724
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:56,780
A hundred percent.

725
00:27:56,780 --> 00:28:01,780
Guys, I'm at a point in my life and in business especially,

726
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:03,760
but if there's a relationship,

727
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,560
whether it's a business relationship, a friendship,

728
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:08,920
whatever, and people get like,

729
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,680
if I can tell they're gonna be difficult

730
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:14,040
and high maintenance, and it's gonna take me a lot to make,

731
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,780
like, I meet a new friend and it's like,

732
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:17,880
they get offended easy, dude.

733
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,720
It's not my friend, bro.

734
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,440
Like, I just don't have the energy.

735
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,680
If I meet a business owner,

736
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,060
I don't care what you're willing to give me.

737
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:25,680
I used to be the guy, and maybe you guys wanna do this.

738
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:30,520
I used to call, I would call it an a-hole tax.

739
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,360
So I would be like, okay,

740
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,020
this person's gonna be a difficult,

741
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:35,180
they're gonna kind of be an a-hole.

742
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,500
I'm gonna charge them extra.

743
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,980
And if they do it, I'll still work with them.

744
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,580
And I would put up with quite a bit

745
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,380
because I wanted the money.

746
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:43,540
And even now, I just won't do that, dude.

747
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:46,260
If somebody's difficult with, like, I just won't.

748
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:49,860
Like, we've had, we've had students, dude.

749
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:52,420
We've had students that, like, we can just tell,

750
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:54,540
and we're like, yeah, it's not worth it.

751
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:57,480
Go your merry way, you're not worth anything.

752
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,280
And it's just, no amount of money is worth it.

753
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,220
So keep that in mind, guys,

754
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:04,100
is if somebody's difficult in the beginning,

755
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,580
they're probably gonna be difficult throughout.

756
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,580
And depending on what you're,

757
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,740
like, you'll get what you tolerate.

758
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,700
And I won't tolerate much at this point, right?

759
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:13,900
I know what I'm worth.

760
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,260
I know I'm valuable.

761
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:19,020
And my tolerance has gone completely down.

762
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,100
It's very low.

763
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:23,480
I have a very low tolerance for a bunch of weird people

764
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,780
that I'm just not interested in talking to.

765
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:28,020
So just be choosy, dude.

766
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:31,300
It's your business, it's your clients.

767
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,700
You get to choose who you work with.

768
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,140
You get to choose the price.

769
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,820
You get to choose how you do business.

770
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:38,560
You get to, it's literally how you build it

771
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,380
and what you're willing to tolerate and accept.

772
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,740
And that's the beautiful thing about it, okay?

773
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:46,160
So biggest takeaway I'm gonna say from qualifying

774
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:51,080
is it's most likely an issue with who you're talking to,

775
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,060
not an issue with what you're saying.

776
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,700
In sales, most of the time,

777
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,880
if you're losing someone at a certain step,

778
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,960
it's the step before, right?

779
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,840
If you're losing them when you're trying to get,

780
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,560
when you're cold calling, trying to do the hook

781
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,120
and you're not hooking anyone,

782
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,820
usually because you're talking to the wrong people, right?

783
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:09,840
If you're losing them, when you're sending them leads,

784
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,600
usually when you did the hook, you oversold it,

785
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,720
you said too much, whatever, you freaked them out.

786
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:18,160
It's usually the one or two steps before.

787
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,400
So you're not closing the deal,

788
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,800
you usually didn't do the setup correctly, right?

789
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,640
Which by the way, starts from the moment you call

790
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,480
to the moment that you close the deal.

791
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,800
Any other comments, any other questions that people have?

792
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,600
Yeah, we got some comments that started rolling.

793
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,080
And so real quick, this is just, we can address this.

794
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,360
Corey Gilbert said, if I got 80 clicks and only five leads,

795
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,000
is that a good ratio?

796
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,120
I think that's 16%.

797
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,840
I was trying to do the calculation while you're talking.

798
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,400
So 16% like click to lead ratio.

799
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,680
I think that sounds pretty good to me,

800
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,720
depending on the niche, I guess, right?

801
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,640
If it's plumbing, it's probably pretty bad.

802
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,440
If it's basement waterproofing,

803
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,960
that's a good conversion right there.

804
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,000
Okay, so let's see.

805
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:01,840
Corey made the comment,

806
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,360
I don't see how rare is faster with DD.

807
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,240
So Corey, I don't know if you've like ever done

808
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,360
a market research like template on your own,

809
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:13,080
like Google Sheets, like kind of in the original training,

810
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:16,000
but it takes a long while to go over the individual backlinks

811
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,840
and everything,

812
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,040
because you're able to just put in one thing.

813
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,120
Yeah, I don't-

814
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,720
You should go try, what you should do is go to,

815
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,400
I think in the training,

816
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,240
we talk about like how to do the due diligence

817
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,400
with the sheet.

818
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,080
Go and open up a Google Sheet

819
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:34,320
and go and copy and paste everything in.

820
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,960
Look at the backlinks,

821
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,200
go and find the age of the domain.

822
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,880
Get a White Spark account and get a-

823
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:42,640
Get a White Spark, go do all of that.

824
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,160
Yeah, go time it.

825
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,320
It's way faster.

826
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,360
It's probably four or five times faster

827
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,200
to do it on due diligence.

828
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,520
You're probably comparing,

829
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,000
I think you're just comparing that to,

830
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,240
I don't think there's any other comparison.

831
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,920
Go try and do it manually.

832
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,920
And by the way,

833
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,800
for those of you that don't want to use Rankin Energy,

834
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,760
you don't have to use it by all means.

835
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,840
I did my first, not thousand,

836
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,200
but probably my first hundred due diligence,

837
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,480
not even using the template.

838
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,600
I used to print the pages off

839
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,560
and I would write them physically out.

840
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,160
And I had this stack of due diligence

841
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,760
and I would sit there and I would spend

842
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,360
three, four hours sometimes in a day,

843
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:19,120
just looking at cities, just clicking through cities,

844
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,600
copy and paste and clearing my browser history.

845
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,960
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

846
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,480
Okay, yep, yep, yep.

847
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,440
And the other problem with that guys is you're human

848
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,960
so you're not going to see as much stuff.

849
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,240
You might read it wrong,

850
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,640
like all these different variables.

851
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,080
You don't have to use that tool.

852
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,040
But what I was saying with my point being

853
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,840
with using Rankin Engine is that

854
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,680
if I could save even five minutes

855
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,960
and I'm doing 20 due diligence,

856
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,200
dude, I mean, I just saved myself what?

857
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,880
Over an hour, almost two hours,

858
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,920
hour and 40 minutes.

859
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,560
Like that's insane, right?

860
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:51,440
And I know you're saving 15 minutes per due diligence.

861
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,120
So anyway, sometimes there's no context.

862
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,440
Go do one manually.

863
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,680
But even if you don't want to,

864
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:58,160
then just use the regular sheet.

865
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,840
The point is you got to put in the reps.

866
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,320
And the reason I know how to look at a good area

867
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,760
is because I've literally done over a thousand myself.

868
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,840
So I know when an area, even if it looks good,

869
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,800
oh, that thing's off.

870
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,080
This looks like that one time that I tried it.

871
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,800
And then, so as much as I want to train

872
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:13,840
and as much I want to show you,

873
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,560
it does take you doing reps to figure it out.

874
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,840
But great question, Cory.

875
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,080
Yeah, and for the record,

876
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,000
the reason it took Nick four years to scale

877
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,960
was because he was doing his due diligence on paper

878
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,320
in the 21st century.

879
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,680
Just throwing that out there.

880
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,640
All right.

881
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:31,760
That's just a small example of a much larger problem.

882
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,040
I was doing everything in my business.

883
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,840
Old school, slow, I'm doing it myself.

884
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,200
I'm writing my own content.

885
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,240
Like I was not going to let go of sales.

886
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,840
I didn't know how to scale.

887
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,840
And finally in 2020, I was like, okay, let's go.

888
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,520
But yeah, good point.

889
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,360
That's right.

890
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,680
So Jason, great question.

891
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,840
Will there be a module

892
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,920
where we can look over your shoulder

893
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,240
doing due diligence in R&R engine?

894
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,400
We aren't rank and rent engine.

895
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,800
We are working on redoing the due diligence training.

896
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,640
Of course.

897
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,200
And by the way, we are going to be using

898
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,520
the rank and rent engine tool

899
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,600
with the new training as the go-to tool.

900
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,920
Because I know in our original one,

901
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,400
I used a couple of different tools

902
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,720
and I kind of said use whatever.

903
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,080
It's easier if I can just use one.

904
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,840
In this one, we have control over.

905
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,640
We trust at least to a certain extent

906
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:19,600
because we can only trust Google's data they give us.

907
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,880
But yes, that's going to be part of it for sure.

908
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,280
So just as a heads up,

909
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,600
we might have something even released

910
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,920
a little sooner than that.

911
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,120
Kind of give you guys some snippets.

912
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,200
You have to wait for everything to come out.

913
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,320
But yes, that's a really good question.

914
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,160
Jason, all red?

915
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,400
No, that was Jason Adam.

916
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,360
Okay, great.

917
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,200
What's up, Jason?

918
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,160
Yeah.

919
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,000
That's right.

920
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,360
So real quick, let me see this question.

921
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,080
Okay, yeah.

922
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,640
Joe says, hey guys, new to the group.

923
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,840
So Joe, let me get back to you that in just a second.

924
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,200
I'm going to try to answer any qualifying questions

925
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,600
that a lot of people are having

926
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,280
rank and run engine questions.

927
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,480
Let me see.

928
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:56,720
Also, real quick, there's a, what's the code?

929
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:59,200
Somebody had a couple of people message me.

930
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,040
Can you, can someone post the chat?

931
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:06,040
The code for the discount is capital land.

932
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,280
It's all caps landlord 24.

933
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,240
Okay.

934
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,080
You want to drive that?

935
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:13,920
You can put that in there.

936
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,760
I'm looking through the comments.

937
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,920
Porter, can you put that in?

938
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,920
Yep.

939
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,760
All caps.

940
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,360
This for digital landlord students.

941
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,200
Correct.

942
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,400
Landlord, all caps, landlord, one word, 24, no spaces.

943
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,160
That's for, I think 20% off for the first two months.

944
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:30,120
Again, guys, use whatever you want to use.

945
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,960
You don't have to use anything.

946
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,680
If you can get around and you can plug this and plug that,

947
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,520
you don't have to.

948
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,400
We're just trying to make this

949
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,840
as easy as possible for you guys.

950
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:43,240
And for me, if I can go and I can save two hours a day,

951
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,680
look at 20 more due diligence,

952
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,360
maybe find one or two extra good cities,

953
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,920
that one or two cities every day times five days

954
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:54,040
times fourth weeks, times 12 months.

955
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,240
Dude, I'm light years ahead.

956
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,400
But sometimes when you start,

957
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:00,040
you're just thinking about, you know, whatever.

958
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,720
You're thinking about, I'm going to do this manually,

959
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,560
which is fine.

960
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,840
Go do it manually and then you'll appreciate it later.

961
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,880
So, but yeah, landlord 24 is the code.

962
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,960
What other questions?

963
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,680
Yeah.

964
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,520
So Julia has a really good question.

965
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,320
Says, what are the main questions you asked

966
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,960
during prospecting, live transfers and following up?

967
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,680
If you guys already answered this, it's no problem.

968
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,960
I'll just rewatch the live.

969
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,920
We can address this specifically.

970
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,200
I did put in the comments

971
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,760
because I kind of anticipated this.

972
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,960
Fixit Felix, a while back, he made a post

973
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,360
and kind of just assembled a lot of the qualifying questions

974
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,200
slash green flags.

975
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,440
And then of course the opposite of those would be red flags.

976
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,240
He looks for one qualifying business center.

977
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,640
So I put that in the chat.

978
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,880
And Nick, I also texted it to you and Porter in Slack

979
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,760
if you guys want to look at that real quick.

980
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,840
But it kind of, these questions just,

981
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,000
we look at them to check off the main boxes.

982
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,320
And I kind of talked about this earlier,

983
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,760
but hungry to grow their business.

984
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,480
Not only that, kind of a nuance is hungry to grow,

985
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,400
like hungry for the specific leads in the specific area.

986
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,240
That's something that if you miss that,

987
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,440
that can turn out to be a bad fit.

988
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,160
If they have to travel 50 minutes

989
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,760
and you don't realize that for your tree trimming job,

990
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,960
you know, they're not gonna really be wanting to do that.

991
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,680
So a couple questions.

992
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,680
I'll let you answer these, Nick.

993
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,400
Okay, let's go rapid fire through the questions.

994
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:13,400
And real quick, let's, I love this green light

995
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,480
in qualifying questions that you put.

996
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,760
I think we can just copy and paste that

997
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:19,320
as like a parting little gift for everybody.

998
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,840
So let's just rapid fire these last few questions.

999
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,680
We'll drop that.

1000
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,520
That's gonna be the green light, you know,

1001
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,720
and also the qualifying questions

1002
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,440
that you can, as like a takeaway.

1003
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,040
And real quick, if I could ask you, Nick,

1004
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,480
and I can give my quick 20 second opinion here.

1005
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,000
It seems like there's a balance on the cold call.

1006
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,520
If you ask too many probing questions,

1007
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,320
it's easy to lose the deal and spook them.

1008
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,000
And like, it's easy to lose.

1009
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:40,840
But then on the same end,

1010
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,840
you don't want to wait till you've sent four leads

1011
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,240
before you start to ask some discovery questions.

1012
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,720
So for me personally, it kind of seems like

1013
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:50,000
after I send that first lead,

1014
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,160
then I can kind of like,

1015
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:55,360
I now earned the right to like investigate to some degree.

1016
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,520
I don't know what your thoughts on that.

1017
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:59,160
Or like, if you have discovery calls after the cold caller.

1018
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,000
100%.

1019
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,600
Dude, from the top, as soon as I get the deal,

1020
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,680
if I feel confident enough to send them one lead

1021
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,000
and I don't feel like they're shady

1022
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,040
or trying to get a free lead, I'll send them the lead.

1023
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,440
And then I'll call them back after they get the lead.

1024
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,280
Like, hey, did you get that schedule?

1025
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,120
Awesome.

1026
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,560
Hey, I want to ask you really quick.

1027
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,000
Like, yeah, you've earned the right to ask those questions.

1028
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,360
And sometimes on that first call, I can tell,

1029
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,720
hey, dude, I actually was talking to my partner.

1030
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,400
This is something we're super interested in.

1031
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,560
Yo, you're from Utah.

1032
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,200
Like, they're just warm.

1033
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,960
I'll feel comfortable to do that right there.

1034
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,280
But a lot of times I do wait till the second call

1035
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,320
as I'm building the trust

1036
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,640
and earning the right to ask those questions.

1037
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,480
Yes, exactly.

1038
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,280
Sure, if you hear the chainsaw in the background,

1039
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:39,120
now's not a good time to ask how many crews they have.

1040
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:39,960
That's exactly.

1041
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:40,800
All right.

1042
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,680
That's exactly right.

1043
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,520
All right.

1044
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,040
Yeah, I just put that in the comments.

1045
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,760
I'll do it one more time.

1046
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,240
If, Nick, you want to just read through

1047
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,360
those qualifying questions,

1048
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,800
you can just kind of sprinkle these up

1049
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,400
throughout the sales process.

1050
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,040
Obviously, the earlier, the better without spooking up.

1051
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,120
So I'm going to just read through

1052
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,280
the qualifying questions right now.

1053
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,480
Some that you could ask, you don't need to ask all.

1054
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:02,760
And you certainly don't have to ask.

1055
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,240
These are just some good ideas, okay?

1056
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,840
Do you want more jobs, which is part of our script, right?

1057
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:10,120
Hey, are you hungry to take on more jobs?

1058
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,560
I'm guessing you're not allergic to money

1059
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,640
and you're spending money on ads.

1060
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,360
I'm assuming you want more jobs, okay?

1061
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:17,960
Then you can also ask

1062
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:21,200
if you will specifically want a certain type of job.

1063
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,640
You can ask how long they've been in business.

1064
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,200
That's indicative of like,

1065
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,440
if they're maybe going to go belly up

1066
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,600
or they have any money in the bank.

1067
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,840
Oh, I just started last week.

1068
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,120
I have a chainsaw and a truck.

1069
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:34,680
That one could last two days or, you know,

1070
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:35,520
those are rough.

1071
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,560
I've worked with those people before.

1072
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,640
They never pan out.

1073
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:41,840
Making sure that they're licensed and insured.

1074
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,320
That one you might want to bring up

1075
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,160
a little bit down the road.

1076
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,680
Cause if they're not, you might spook them.

1077
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,560
Again-

1078
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,440
If they have a green card at the minimum.

1079
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,280
About a hundred percent.

1080
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,120
Yeah, you got to make sure

1081
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,560
they at least are legal in the country.

1082
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,040
That's a given.

1083
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:56,760
I don't know.

1084
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,040
That one, I'm not sure we're going to include that

1085
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,200
in the training or how to bring that one up,

1086
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,480
but maybe we'll do that on a special section

1087
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,840
if you're targeting certain states.

1088
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,600
How many crews do you have?

1089
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,840
And then how are you currently landing your jobs?

1090
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,760
Are you getting them from Facebook?

1091
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,720
Is it referral?

1092
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:10,920
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1093
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:14,240
And another question I might ask is,

1094
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,400
you know, I would ask this at some point,

1095
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,840
but you could also ask us on the opening calls,

1096
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,520
like, dude, it sounds like you know what you're doing.

1097
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,360
Like what?

1098
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,960
You probably have a pretty high close percentage, right?

1099
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:24,320
How many deals are you closing out of the,

1100
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,240
out of the leads you're getting?

1101
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,080
Or are you closing what percentage?

1102
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,520
And they're usually going to be like, oh, like 90%.

1103
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,520
And it's like, well, that's cause you get all your jobs

1104
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,360
from referrals.

1105
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,440
So they're already sold, bro.

1106
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,240
It should be a hundred percent.

1107
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,760
So actually anything below a hundred means

1108
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,640
you're sub-optimal human and you suck.

1109
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,880
But good job.

1110
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,880
Here's, should I go over the green lights really quick,

1111
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,000
Aaron, to wrap this up?

1112
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,560
Yeah.

1113
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,880
And obviously the opposite of these would be red flags.

1114
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:51,720
100%.

1115
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:52,560
Here's some green lights.

1116
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,320
If they're hungry to grow,

1117
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,840
if they're hungry for specific leads

1118
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,280
in your specific location,

1119
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,680
if they have bandwidth to grow,

1120
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,720
if they can actually handle more jobs,

1121
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,640
if they've been in business for at least a couple of years

1122
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,640
and that they're licensed to ensure,

1123
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:04,800
these are a couple of green flags.

1124
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,240
Anything opposite of this is going to be red flags as well.

1125
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:09,640
But guys, I guess as my final thought,

1126
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,200
you can have all the answers.

1127
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,840
You can have everything dialed out in front of you,

1128
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,120
but until you just start making calls,

1129
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,880
you're not going to know what the heck we're talking about.

1130
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:18,800
It's not going to make sense.

1131
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,120
It's not going to be relatable.

1132
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,120
You got to pick up the phone.

1133
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,120
You got to make the mistakes.

1134
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:24,120
You're going to have to call and say too much

1135
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,720
and bomb it on a business owner verbally

1136
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:28,240
until you lose the deal on the perfect business owner

1137
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,680
that was going to pay you all this money.

1138
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,880
And you said too much, you lost the deal.

1139
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,760
I mean, Porter has lost like $3,000 a month

1140
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:37,000
in retainers over the last like six hours, dude,

1141
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,760
or six days.

1142
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,080
I mean, Porter's just giving away.

1143
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:41,920
Just throw it.

1144
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,240
Just give it.

1145
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:44,080
No, I'm just kidding.

1146
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,680
But you have to lose these deals, guys.

1147
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,640
I've lost deals saying some of the most silliest stuff,

1148
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,160
embarrassing stuff.

1149
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,640
I mean, it's just dumb stunts.

1150
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:54,960
And this is including alarms.

1151
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,280
Like I've lost thousands and tens of thousands of dollars

1152
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,760
just saying and doing the wrong stuff.

1153
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,680
And it took those deals that I lost

1154
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,000
to get to where I am now.

1155
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,480
And so I looked at it as like a debt

1156
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,440
that I was paying towards learning how to do this.

1157
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:12,120
So I think no matter what we said here, guys,

1158
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,720
if you're not doing calls, if you're not making calls,

1159
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:15,960
none of this matters.

1160
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,880
Step one, make calls.

1161
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,880
Step two, figure out where you're going wrong.

1162
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:23,160
Take the information we shared today and start refining.

1163
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,400
Become obsessed with your craft.

1164
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,600
Become obsessed and dial them.

1165
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:30,520
Because if you can get 5%, 10%, 15% better at this,

1166
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:33,600
again, the people that make the most money in this business

1167
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:36,360
are not the geeks, not the tech, not the this, that,

1168
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,640
the rest, Mr. Backlink.

1169
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:40,520
They're the people that know how to get business owners

1170
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,040
to give them their credit card.

1171
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,400
They don't even have the best product.

1172
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,800
They don't even give their business owners the most leads.

1173
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,680
They're not even the best at retaining them.

1174
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,840
They are the best at getting business owners

1175
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,240
to give them their money.

1176
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:53,720
And so you don't have to be in sales

1177
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:56,000
or have a sales experience to start,

1178
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,880
but it is in your best interest

1179
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:00,480
to start obsessing over this skill

1180
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,800
and at least do it until you get to a certain revenue level.

1181
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,600
And then sure, go ahead and outsource it.

1182
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:07,000
Find somebody to do it if you really, really hate it.

1183
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,080
But this is a skillset that has the highest return

1184
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,800
of any skillset in this business.

1185
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,120
And it is called sales,

1186
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:16,840
and it is taking candy from little children.

1187
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:17,800
I'm just kidding.

1188
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,400
All right, anything else?

1189
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,560
Any other questions?

1190
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,280
There was a couple of questions on rank and rent engine one,

1191
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,120
but I don't know if, is there a live,

1192
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,800
like when I'm trying to think of something we can,

1193
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,120
something we can point them to

1194
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:33,400
if they have more questions about that.

1195
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,040
I'll text Ryan right now

1196
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,120
and see if he wants to go live in the group

1197
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:38,360
and kind of ask those questions.

1198
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,880
If you wanna screenshot those and send me a text after,

1199
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,160
let's separate those,

1200
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,480
so that would make a really good live.

1201
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:45,120
I think there's probably gonna be a bunch of questions

1202
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:47,400
that have come up sitting out that people are using it

1203
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,960
and whatever, but that's a great point.

1204
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:49,800
Will you text me?

1205
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:51,520
Yes.

1206
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:52,360
Okay, guys, if you-

1207
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:54,840
So guys, we're gonna address those questions.

1208
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,400
Yeah, so those aren't gonna get ignored.

1209
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:58,720
Yeah, no, for sure.

1210
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,400
In fact, let me just text him

1211
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,240
so no one thinks I'm making that up.

1212
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,480
Hey, I'm on the call,

1213
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,720
the live right now.

1214
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:15,080
We have some people that have questions

1215
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:17,640
about rank and run engine.

1216
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:20,800
Anyway, rank and run engine.

1217
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:21,640
I'm gonna say wanna go live-

1218
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:23,600
We have one more qualified question

1219
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,080
we can ask after this.

1220
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,240
Okay.

1221
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:30,560
Okay, go ahead.

1222
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:32,400
Awesome.

1223
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,480
So Mike Price says,

1224
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:35,760
what do you guys think about selling to the top,

1225
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,920
like one to five organically ranked companies in the city,

1226
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:41,720
people who have probably invested in SEO at some point?

1227
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:45,520
As long as they're running ads, dude, I don't care.

1228
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,280
I got a business owner right now in one of my areas

1229
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:53,040
that is ranked on Google.

1230
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:58,040
They're also paying another company to do what I'm doing.

1231
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,080
I think that they might just be paying them to do SEO

1232
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:04,280
and they are buying leads.

1233
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:07,440
So as long as they're running ads,

1234
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,000
they're still hungry to grow, dude.

1235
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:13,080
If they're not, I don't really see that,

1236
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,880
I'm probably not gonna target them.

1237
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,880
That I do like, if I don't have any,

1238
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,320
if they're not paying for ads,

1239
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:22,720
can't find anyone in the Facebook group,

1240
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,760
the fact that I can tell they've done SEO

1241
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,760
at least lets me know they spent some money

1242
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:27,600
on their market.

1243
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:30,040
They paid somebody to build their website.

1244
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:31,760
That's at least a start,

1245
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,280
but I'd probably try to target somebody

1246
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,040
like on the bottom of page one, top of page two,

1247
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,840
where I can tell their page title is done

1248
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,320
by someone in those SEO.

1249
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,440
They have an H1, you can kind of tell

1250
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:41,960
if it's done professionally.

1251
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:43,320
I wouldn't target somebody like that.

1252
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:45,160
It's like, oh, they paid money,

1253
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,320
but they're not getting the lead.

1254
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:49,960
So, but if they're paying for ads,

1255
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,400
I don't really care where they're ranked

1256
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:53,760
because they want more business.

1257
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,680
Most of the big companies, by the way,

1258
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:58,080
that client that was paying me like 30 grand a month

1259
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:01,040
at one point, all of the cities

1260
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,280
that we were getting leads for them,

1261
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:07,000
their website was ranked at the top three with us.

1262
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:09,360
They were just hungry.

1263
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:11,200
So it doesn't matter.

1264
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,040
It doesn't matter.

1265
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:12,880
Just go for it.

1266
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,640
Sometimes you gotta stop overthinking too.

1267
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:15,800
And it's a great question,

1268
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,440
but I think sometimes the reason

1269
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,280
that someone like me and Porter

1270
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:23,440
and some of these guys are doing well

1271
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:24,480
is we don't overthink

1272
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,360
or we're too lazy to think or we can't think.

1273
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:27,200
I don't know.

1274
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,040
We're just like, oh, sweet.

1275
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:30,000
Pick up the phone, call, give them a couple of leads,

1276
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,360
build up a little website.

1277
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:33,000
That sounds easy.

1278
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:33,960
And that's why we do it.

1279
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:34,800
And I'm telling you,

1280
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:35,800
this is such a simple business model.

1281
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:37,000
Don't ever complicate it.

1282
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,400
That's it.

1283
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,240
All right.

1284
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,060
Thanks guys.

1285
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:41,900
Appreciate it, Aaron.

1286
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:43,880
I'm gonna upload this to our deal

1287
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:45,240
and I'll see you soon.

1288
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:46,640
I'll see you too on our team meeting.

1289
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:47,480
Appreciate everyone being on.

1290
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:51,400
We'll see you on next Tuesday at 7 a.m. MST.

1291
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:52,640
If you're new, by the way,

1292
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:53,520
welcome to your first call.

1293
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,720
Much more to come.

1294
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,160
And I just met, hold on.

1295
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,400
Let me see if Ryan notices me back.

1296
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:58,480
I just told him he can go live

1297
00:46:58,480 --> 00:46:59,440
anytime he wants this week.

1298
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:00,400
Let me see.

1299
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,280
Has not responded yet.

1300
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,000
As soon as he does, we'll make an announcement.

1301
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:04,840
Thanks guys.

1302
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:05,760
Talk soon. See you guys.

1303
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:06,600
Bye.
