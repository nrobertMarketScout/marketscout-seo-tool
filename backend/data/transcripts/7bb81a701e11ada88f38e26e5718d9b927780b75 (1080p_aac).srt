Robert says, Nick, do you try to sign first the BO that is on top of the sponsored ad section?

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:11,920
Do you check there? I don't really care if they're at the top or not. As long as they're running ads,

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:17,440
they're going on my list. But yeah, I mean, checking their reviews is not a bad thing.

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,280
If I'm looking at the reviews, they're like, oh, this guy is rude. This guy had no customer service.

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,400
That's going to be my partner. And that means they're probably not going to close deals. So

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,960
that's going to be an issue. I want to check into all those things. So Robert,

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,640
check into those things. But yeah, anyone at the top is going on my list. That's part of our

8
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,560
training or part of our module and building your list. So yes. Okay.
