1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
When doing due diligence, what are the ideal numbers

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,960
when looking for backlinks and citations, et cetera?

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,920
Okay, so as part of the due diligence,

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,000
you guys have probably noticed,

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
and we've talked about this in the training,

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,480
that one of the things you're gonna look at

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,160
is how many backlinks do your competitors have, right?

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,480
And you can use this, do this with other tools,

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,040
but that's the wrong question, Jaylen,

10
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,040
and I'm gonna tell you why.

11
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,640
Not because you said anything wrong,

12
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,640
but because it doesn't matter how many backlinks they have.

13
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,200
What matters is the quality of the backlinks that they have,

14
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,080
and I'm gonna explain it like this.

15
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:39,080
If I were to offer you, say, 100 links from whatever,

16
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,600
random directory sites, whatever,

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,040
or I would give you one link from Forbes,

18
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:55,760
which one do you think would help you more, okay?

19
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,400
I would take the Forbes one all day.

20
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,240
Why?

21
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,560
Because unless one of those 100 is some crazy site,

22
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,400
unless one of those 100 is entrepreneur,

23
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,680
that Forbes article is gonna hold far more weight

24
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,880
with Google than 100 of these little ones.

25
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,400
Going back to the social example,

26
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,000
you being friends and homies with the quarterback

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,800
or with the student body president holds far more weight

28
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,160
than you being friends with all the ninth graders,

29
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,880
if you're a ninth grader, right, that are no-namers, right?

30
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,720
And again, we're just talking

31
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,400
about some stupid popularity contest,

32
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,960
but that's kind of what this is.

33
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,120
So it's not about how many, it's about the quality.

34
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,760
So what you guys need to make sure you're doing is,

35
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,280
yes, how many backlinks they have,

36
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,040
but the backlinks they do have,

37
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,280
how are, what are those backlinks like?

38
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,680
Are those good backlinks?

39
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,440
Do those have domain authority?

40
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,680
Do those have trust flow?

41
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,040
Do those have citation flow?

42
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,160
These are all things that we're gonna be getting into.

43
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,120
So it's not an ideal number of backlinks,

44
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,360
but what I look for is I'm looking for people

45
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,360
that are ranking, that have no backlinks is great,

46
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,880
but maybe they have three or four backlinks

47
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,600
and they are no follow-back links,

48
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,840
which we'll get into in a later video and into the training,

49
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,440
or there do follow, or there do follow backlinks

50
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,200
that have no juice or they're no follow backlinks, okay?

51
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,080
And they only have a couple of them.

52
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,040
So I, the question, how I wanna answer this,

53
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,080
it doesn't, it's not about how many,

54
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,600
it's about the quality.

55
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,600
And if they have 10 backlinks that have zero trust flow

56
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,920
and a little bit of citation flow,

57
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,880
I don't even view that as a big deal

58
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,960
because I can go and get one good backlink

59
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,960
and I'm gonna beat their 10 crappy backlinks

60
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,240
that maybe are no follow-back links

61
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,280
or maybe don't have any juice.

62
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,000
So amazing question.
