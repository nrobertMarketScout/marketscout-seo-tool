1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
I had someone reach out through referral and they recommended a city for me.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,120
I got them three leads in four days. They charge high prices and are proud of it.

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,240
I got on a call with them both to close and they liked everything until it came to talking about

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,360
price. One business owner said 1500 per month is fair but they have to think about it for two weeks.

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:21,440
I wasn't able to use the method where I said I have someone on the hook. I tried to tell them

6
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,800
I'll need to look for another business owner while they consider and they said that's fine.

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,720
What could I have done differently there to have gotten them to make the decision on the phone?

8
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:35,920
So basically, long story short, he wasn't able to close the deal on the spot.

9
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:41,120
The one business owner said that the 1500 was fine but they need two weeks to think about it.

10
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:48,080
Just a reminder, whenever you guys are getting objections, this is going back to sales 101,

11
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:54,080
whether you're selling freaking ridiculously priced bottled water, shout out to Park Plaza

12
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:59,680
for using glass when they don't need to, that's fine. High priced bottled water, t-shirts,

13
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:05,520
freaking power banks, it doesn't matter what you're selling. If you are getting an objection

14
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:13,280
from your customer, it's almost 100% of the time not what you did. It's not where the objection

15
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:20,240
came that you went wrong. It's the step or a step before. Now, without getting all the context and

16
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,320
without being there as a fly on the wall, without watching over your shoulder, without knowing

17
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:31,360
exactly what was said and the timeline and all the rest, what I can tell you is that I believe,

18
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,560
based on what you're telling me, that what happened is the setup, which is right before

19
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:43,360
the close. The setup is where it went wrong. What I mean by that is that the business owner clearly

20
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:49,840
felt like they could come to you and say they needed time to think about it. We don't get that.

21
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,600
I don't get that. Our agency doesn't get that. We just don't. The reason why is because I know

22
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,400
it's coming. Every person on this earth, every human on this earth is going to say they need

23
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:04,560
to think about it because no one wants to make the wrong decision. I already know that's coming.

24
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,800
As part of the training, what we talked about is the setup. As part of the setup, we want to

25
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,520
eliminate objections. We don't want to wait for them. This is a prime example. When you

26
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:19,280
wait for an objection to come, now you have to overcome it. When you attack the objection first,

27
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,080
when you eliminate the objection first, it's so much easier. It takes one sentence. It takes one

28
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:29,120
quick conversation. It takes one example, and it's not an issue. If you wait for the objection to

29
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:36,240
come, it is almost impossible or extremely difficult to overcome. It is extremely hard

30
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:42,800
to tell someone they can't think about it versus telling someone, hey, all I ask is that by the end

31
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:48,880
of this call, you give me a yes or no. If it's a maybe, it's a no. That is so much easier to do.

32
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,400
Than to wait until they object. I can tell you based on what you're telling me that you went

33
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:00,800
wrong in the setup. You went wrong in not setting the expectations, not being clear that I need an

34
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,000
answer on this. You don't need to say it like that. Hey, I need you to give me a yes or no. We don't

35
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,400
want to spook them. Sometimes I'll say that if the business owner and me were vibing and whatever,

36
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,200
you went wrong in the setup. That needs to be addressed. You need to either say that on the

37
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,360
phone. What I like to bring, I like to definitely bring it up in the screencast, but I also like to

38
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,760
bring it up on the phone call. I'm talking to these business owners. If I'm the one that's still

39
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,240
closing deals, which I've removed myself from that aspect, thank goodness, I did that for years.

40
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,280
I say thank goodness not because I don't like it. I love it. I say thank goodness because it's

41
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,640
allowed me to scale now because I don't have to be there and get deals. You went wrong in the setup.

42
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,120
You needed to bring that up in the screencast that you were going to need a decision because

43
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,560
you need to find someone as soon as possible. These leads are valuable. It's money going down

44
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,720
the drain. I'm going to give you some for free, but you need to let me know by the end of this.

45
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:55,280
That's all I ask. Don't leave me in the whole no man's land or are you going to think about it,

46
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,960
that kind of thing. That's all I ask from you, Mr. Business Owner. By the way, make sure that you

47
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:03,440
have decision makers on the phone. There's no pressure. I've given you the leads. I'm going

48
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,320
to show you the pricing. I'm going to go over everything. You're going to have every bit of

49
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:14,240
information. That's it. You went wrong in the setup. Now, one more thing. If you do get that

50
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:18,000
objection, I want to cover this really quick. Let's say you to get the objection of, I want

51
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,560
to think about it. I need to think about it, whatever. Now, your only option is to try and

52
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:29,600
overcome the objection. Again, just remember, and I think we even have this in fact almost,

53
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,720
and I know we do, inside of the premium sales training library, which if you don't have access

54
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:40,880
to it, that is the library that's for those students that are paid in full. There were some

55
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,720
of you guys that before we started doing the funding and everything else, we're on payment

56
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,760
plans when we used to do those internally. If you are not already, make sure you get yourself paid

57
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,920
in full so you can have access to the premium sales training library. If you are paid in full,

58
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,840
message Fix It Felix to get access to all that material. But in there, we have a training on

59
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:05,200
Feel Felt Found. We want to make sure, just a quick recap, make sure that you let the business

60
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:10,080
owner know that you feel them. Hey, I feel you. I understand. You don't want to make a wrong

61
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:16,720
decision, whatever, right? Felt, you want to make sure that you let them know that another business

62
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,120
owner felt the exact same way. You can say, I felt the same way when doing such and such a thing,

63
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,280
but it's more powerful if you say, you know, remember that guy Joe I told you about that

64
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,840
we work with in Cincinnati? Yeah, it's funny you say that. He felt the exact same way. He's like,

65
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:36,400
dude, I got to think about it. Feel, then felt, and then it comes to found. But what Joe found is

66
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,320
that at the end of the day, he would rather, even though he wasn't 100% certain, he's like,

67
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,880
I can't be 100% certain about anything. He would rather take that slight risk than me go with

68
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,800
somebody else and work with somebody else because I've given him the free leads. He's already looking

69
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,960
to do something different from what he's already doing. He needed to grow and it just made sense.

70
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,280
So that's the feel felt found. And then you go in for the close again. Okay.

71
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,200
The only other thing I would mention before you do that, I skipped a step, make sure that you

72
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:08,000
make sure that that is their actual objection. Okay, you need to tie them down. Okay, Bob,

73
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,800
I get it. So you want to think about it, right? So besides thinking about it,

74
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,280
and I'm doing air quotes, because that's a broad thing. Besides you thinking about it.

75
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,680
Is there any other thing, any other question, any other reason that this wouldn't make sense

76
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:28,560
today? No. Okay. Now I'm going to go a little deeper. Let me ask you this, Bob. And again,

77
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,640
I'm not going to be pushy. I just want to understand what exactly do you need to think about?

78
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,160
Because I know that you know where your budget's at, right? You run the business,

79
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,520
you know where the budget's at. I know that your partners are on the phone. What exactly

80
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,080
when you say you want to think about what exactly do you mean? And they're going to tell you,

81
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,520
right? And you're going to dig and you're going to dig and you're going to make sure and you're

82
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:57,360
going to isolate that one specific issue and make sure that's the actual cause. Then you're

83
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,040
going to use the feel felt found method. And then you're going to go back in for the close. Okay.

84
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:06,560
Tie down the objection, feel felt found, go back for the close. And you don't need to be super

85
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,480
aggressive. You could do it in your own way. You don't need to just be super blunt. I like to be

86
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:15,120
that way sometimes. Sometimes I don't. It just depends on the situation, but you can do it the

87
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,880
way that you want to do it. But again, think about it. The setup, you could have easily just

88
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,760
told them that on the call, right? On the screencast. That would have just been simple.

89
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:32,240
A line, a sentence, two sentences versus you didn't and now you're at objection

90
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,200
overcoming and now you have to tie it down and now you have to do the feel felt found.

91
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,240
And now you have to go back in for the close and it's a little bit uncomfortable and you're

92
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,480
going to sweat a little bit and you're going to, it's so much easier to eliminate than it

93
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,520
is to overcome. Sorry, that was a long answer, but that's the truth. Okay.
