1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,240
Guys, I've already talked about this, but I want to talk about the questions and the

2
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,840
information that we push off until later.

3
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:20,680
There are a couple pieces of questions or a couple pieces of information that there's

4
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,400
a time and a place, and I want to go over those really briefly.

5
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,200
I've already talked about this, so I don't want to take too much time, but there's two

6
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,200
things.

7
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,720
As you start doing this live transfer process and you're calling them in between, you're

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,920
texting them in between, you're starting to build this relationship, they're going to

9
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,840
get comfortable with you and they're going to go...

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,920
Some of these guys are going to say, some of these ladies are going to say, hey, tell

11
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,000
me how much is this going to cost?

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,680
Just shoot me straight, man.

13
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,160
I'm a no BS kind of guy.

14
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:50,480
I'm a no BS kind of lady, and they're going to ask you, how does this work?

15
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,320
There are two things that you want to push off.

16
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,360
Number one is price and number two is deal structure because they're the two things that

17
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,360
can scare people.

18
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,280
I do not share either of those until the proper time.

19
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,240
I don't share the price until the final call.

20
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,840
I don't share the deal structure until the screencast, which is going to be in the next

21
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,280
module.

22
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,040
If these keep coming up, just keep letting them know, hey, I don't want to put the cart

23
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,040
before the horse.

24
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,840
We'll deal with that later.

25
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,520
Let me just get you a couple more leads and we can talk about it, but I'm very flexible.

26
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,760
Just so you know, I'm really creative.

27
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,880
I own this company.

28
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,880
It's on me.

29
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,960
I get to decide.

30
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:22,960
That's my go-to.

31
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,960
Nice.

32
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,240
I've mentioned this before, but if somebody keeps hitting you on price, price, price,

33
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,920
price, price, and it gets to the point where it's like, they're going to need no price,

34
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,600
just say, hey, just to be honest with you, Mr. Business Owner, Mr. Business Owner, I

35
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,400
have customers that are paying me three to 500 bucks a month and I have somebody that's

36
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,400
paying me 20, 30K a month.

37
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,400
It's going to be somewhere in between.

38
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,400
Ha, ha, ha.

39
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:44,520
No, but seriously, obviously it'll be way closer to the bottom than the top, but it's

40
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,520
a huge range.

41
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,520
There's a lot of factors.

42
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,600
I don't want to get too deep into that until we found out that this is actually a good

43
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,600
fit.

44
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,600
Okay?

45
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,240
This is something to satisfy them and move on.

46
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,240
That's it.

47
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,520
That's what I say if they keep hitting me on price.

48
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,240
Those two things, the deal structure, and this is something you're going to get a lot

49
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:05,000
as people are going to keep saying, and they're going to be trying to hedge their bet.

50
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,840
They're going to go, yeah, man, this is cool.

51
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,760
I'm just going to raise my prices and I'm going to give you 10% or, hey, this is going

52
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,760
to work out really well.

53
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,940
I'm just going to give you a percentage.

54
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,720
It's going to start to get to your head because you're going to think, man, how am I ever

55
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,520
going to sell this person on a flat fee deal?

56
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,580
Don't let it get to your head.

57
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:20,580
Don't get flustered.

58
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,800
Don't stop and go, hey, man.

59
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I actually don't do commission.

60
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Hey, man.

61
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I don't do paper lead.

62
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,200
I only do flat fee.

63
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,440
You're going to spook them.

64
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,280
The time to bring up the flat fee is after you've explained why commission sucks and

65
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,440
why paper lead sucks during the screencast.

66
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,440
Let them talk.

67
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,440
Let them share.

68
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,440
Let them keep thinking they're going to get a commission deal.

69
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,880
Don't tell them they're going to get a commission deal.

70
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,000
Don't agree with them, but let them talk.

71
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Don't get frustrated.

72
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Don't get flustered.

73
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,360
Just realize what they're trying to do is they're trying to let you know that, hey,

74
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,160
They're comfortable paying a commission, but they don't want to do anything else.

75
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,000
But the thing is they don't understand.

76
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,440
They don't understand why paper lead actually sucks for them.

77
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,960
They don't understand why commission.

78
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,120
There's no incentive for either of you, but there's a time and a place.

79
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,120
I just wanted to mention once again, do not drop price too early.

80
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,600
Do not drop deal structure too early or you're going to kill the deal.

81
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,600
And I want to mention it here because as you start doing these live transfers, you're going

82
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,080
to have a lot of communication with the business owner and they're going to start asking questions.

83
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,240
They're going to get comfortable with you.

84
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,080
They're going to ask and be like, hey, bro.

85
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,560
So, you know, how's this going to work?

86
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,640
I know you want to share.

87
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,640
You want to jump ahead.

88
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,640
You want to sell the whole thing.

89
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,920
There's a time and a place.

90
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,960
You don't want to do it yet.

91
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,520
You want to push it off until the proper time.

92
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,520
We're going to get into that in future videos.
