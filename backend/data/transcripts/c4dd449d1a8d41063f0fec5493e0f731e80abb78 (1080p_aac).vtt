Let's talk about the Google trifecta, the three parts of Google and it's very important

00:12.780 --> 00:16.360
that you guys understand this and guys the more that you can understand about Google

00:16.360 --> 00:22.700
and how it works and how they think and how they operate, the easier it is for us to do

00:22.700 --> 00:25.860
SEO because we just need to reverse engineer what they're thinking.

00:25.860 --> 00:31.420
So really quick, the Google trifecta, that is the three different sections of Google.

00:31.420 --> 00:36.260
First we have the ads, which is the very top section of Google.

00:36.260 --> 00:39.860
So if you do a search, boom, you're going to see that at the top, it's going to say

00:39.860 --> 00:40.860
ad next to it.

00:40.860 --> 00:42.800
That's the ad section.

00:42.800 --> 00:46.140
The next section that we're going to have is what we call Google Local.

00:46.140 --> 00:52.460
It's also called the Google My Business or GMB or Google Business Profiles, whatever.

00:52.460 --> 00:53.460
They keep changing the name.

00:53.460 --> 00:56.260
It's also called the Map Pack, the Three Pack, whatever.

00:56.260 --> 00:58.940
It's probably going to be called the Dinosaur Pack by the time this video.

00:58.940 --> 00:59.940
I don't even know.

00:59.940 --> 01:00.940
Whatever Google decides.

01:00.940 --> 01:04.460
Larry Page and Sergey Brin, shout out to you guys for having some creative minds.

01:04.460 --> 01:05.460
I don't know.

01:05.460 --> 01:07.540
That's the local section.

01:07.540 --> 01:11.940
And there is a specific strategy to ranking in that section that we are going to be covering

01:11.940 --> 01:13.700
in a later module.

01:13.700 --> 01:18.540
And then underneath the map, we have the third section, which is what we would call to or

01:18.540 --> 01:23.180
I'm going to refer to as the actual organic listings, which is underneath the maps.

01:23.180 --> 01:26.900
That's where your website ranks at the top of the organic.

01:26.900 --> 01:32.660
So there's, depending on the search, there's usually one to three ads.

01:32.660 --> 01:35.120
Then there's three in the map.

01:35.120 --> 01:38.580
Sometimes there's four because there's an ad in the maps, if you look really careful.

01:38.580 --> 01:40.100
One of those is an ad.

01:40.100 --> 01:42.300
Then there's 10 search results.

01:42.300 --> 01:45.380
And then sometimes you'll see some ads at the bottom.

01:45.380 --> 01:52.860
And that is what makes up the Google Trifecta, ads, local, and organic.

01:52.860 --> 01:53.860
Very important.

01:53.860 --> 01:54.860
You understand that.

01:54.860 --> 01:54.880
Let's keep going.
