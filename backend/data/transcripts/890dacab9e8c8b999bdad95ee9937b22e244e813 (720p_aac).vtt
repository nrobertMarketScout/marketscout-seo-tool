00:00.000 --> 00:04.640
The first thing I want to tell you guys and you need to remember this and I will write this on here

00:04.720 --> 00:07.600
And make sure it's on the printout on the actual script

00:08.640 --> 00:14.000
Guys this you need to realize that you you don't want this to be high pressure. Okay?

00:14.640 --> 00:16.800
People get scared of high pressure

00:18.000 --> 00:19.840
They hate it. They hate it. They hate it

00:19.840 --> 00:24.480
So you do not want them to be scared of like you don't want them to as soon as they feel pressure

00:24.880 --> 00:29.040
They're gonna they're gonna bounce they're gonna ghost you they're gonna think of a reason like they're not even gonna be paying attention

00:29.040 --> 00:33.360
They're just going to be thinking of a reason why they can how they can get you off their screen. I'm not kidding

00:33.920 --> 00:35.280
so

00:35.280 --> 00:38.480
The couple calls i've been on recently what i've heard is

00:39.120 --> 00:43.520
Guys, I definitely think it's important to let them know. Hey, please don't leave me in

00:43.520 --> 00:46.400
I don't know zone make sure that like just give me a yes or no

00:46.560 --> 00:50.240
but some of you guys are saying that in such a way that it's scaring people off like

00:50.960 --> 00:54.960
There's a couple ways to say that and you don't need to say hey just just to confirm

00:55.200 --> 00:58.000
You will give me a yes or no by the end of this, correct? Like

00:58.640 --> 01:02.880
That's just adding pressure that doesn't need to be added in a different way of saying that it would be like

01:03.280 --> 01:08.560
Hey, like I told you the only thing I ask is just don't leave me in. I don't know zone. That's all I ask

01:08.640 --> 01:12.640
Okay, i've given you enough references and everything else by the end of this. This is a good fit

01:12.640 --> 01:17.040
Let's move forward if it's not then let's not but that's my only ask. Is that fair?

01:17.600 --> 01:22.560
Those are completely different. One of them is giving a ton of pressure. Oh shit. He's gonna like

01:24.000 --> 01:27.680
Crap, how do I get this guy off the call? I don't want to I don't want to have to go into this high pressure situation

01:27.920 --> 01:29.360
so guys

01:29.360 --> 01:31.360
Take the pressure off the call

01:31.760 --> 01:37.040
Take the pressure off of the customer because that is not going to help you that is not something that helps you get the deal

01:37.120 --> 01:41.520
Okay, even though at the end you're going to ask for the deal and if needed we're going to apply a little pressure

01:41.840 --> 01:46.480
We don't want the whole call them to be thinking about that close and thinking about how do I get them off the call?

01:46.880 --> 01:48.080
so so

01:48.080 --> 01:51.760
Take off the pressure. Okay number one and I just want you to be thinking about that the whole time

01:52.240 --> 01:57.520
and and it's kind of like even like um, I know like with ryan even it's like it's and and and

01:57.760 --> 02:03.120
Mahmood's been doing this on his calls like my whole sales pitch is like hey if this makes sense great

02:03.280 --> 02:05.760
If not, no harm, no foul if not, no big deal

02:06.080 --> 02:10.480
I'm repeating these phrases because I want this to seem like no big deal even though deep down

02:10.800 --> 02:12.800
This is a huge deal for me
