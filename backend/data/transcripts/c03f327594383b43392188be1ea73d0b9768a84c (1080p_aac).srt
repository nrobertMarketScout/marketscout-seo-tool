1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,360
What's important that you guys understand is who we're actually writing this content

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,360
for.

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,080
And a lot of people when they get into this business, into the rank and rent digital real

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:21,160
estate space, or may I say rent then rank digital real estate space, they're confused

5
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,840
because they think their content has to be perfect.

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:29,000
And I'm just coming off my last video telling you we need to get obsessed and we need to

7
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,840
get really good at the content, but what you guys have to understand is who we're actually

8
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,160
writing the content for.

9
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,360
And I'm gonna just have you think about it like this, okay?

10
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:43,320
If you are sitting there and your tree, a lightning, whatever, lightning came or the

11
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,360
wind came and your tree like cracked in half and it was leaning over your roof, and you're

12
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,440
looking to get it solved, you're looking to get a tree company to come out and remove

13
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:57,520
it, are you gonna go and search tree company near me and go read every word on that tree

14
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,880
company's website?

15
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,400
Are you gonna go and read every single thing about how to remove a tree and what processes

16
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,880
we use and what saws and all this extraction methods?

17
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,880
Of course not, right?

18
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,800
So what you have to realize is in the services that we talk about, in the services that I

19
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:19,560
recommend in module one of part one of digital landlords, which is looking for layups, which

20
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,320
is picking the right niche, okay?

21
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,920
We are going into services where people just need the work done, that's the point.

22
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,480
They're not going to read the content, they're not.

23
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,440
And I'm telling you right now, I always joke about this, but if you've got somebody who

24
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:39,240
is reading every word of your website, that person is very likely a serial killer.

25
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:44,960
Who reads tree service content or mold removal content or duct cleaning content, and I'll

26
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,200
argue if somebody calls me on a quote form and says, hey, I read every word in your content,

27
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,200
what is this?

28
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,480
I'm not even gonna give that to the business owner anyway because they're literally probably

29
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,480
on the hit list, okay?

30
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,920
Or on America's top ten, that's weird.

31
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,280
No one's reading this stuff, so who are we writing it for?

32
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:04,200
We're writing it for Google, we're writing it for the search engine, so we're writing

33
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,360
it so that when the search engine crawls our page, aka reads our website or our homepage

34
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,160
or service pages, they know what it's about.

35
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,040
They know that it's about the keywords that we want to rank for.

36
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:22,720
They know it's about concrete contractors, concrete near me, cost of concrete, concrete

37
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:29,840
my area, whatever the keywords are, we want Google to know that our website is about that.

38
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,700
So what I want you to do is take a deep breath.

39
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,240
This doesn't need to be perfect.

40
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:38,960
It does not need to pass, you probably had an English teacher like I did that was very

41
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:43,200
critical of making sure that it read properly and all these different things.

42
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,560
Now you have to make sure this does not sound like it was written by a robot, so you have

43
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,560
to give it some thought, and as we start getting an outsourcing, that's one of the things we

44
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,560
have to look at.

45
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,360
We have to make sure that it sounds like it's actually a human, but outside of that, it

46
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,800
doesn't need to be interesting.

47
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,960
It doesn't need to have voice, and the content writers that I've hired in the past, where

48
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,640
Pete, they've tried to overdo it and ham it up and have too much personality, it just

49
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,640
doesn't work.

50
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,040
So guys, take a deep breath.

51
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,600
We're writing this for the search engines.

52
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,800
Don't stress it too much.

53
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,800
Just make it sound like a human wrote it.

54
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,440
Do, and lastly, do not plagiarize.

55
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,640
If you plagiarize, it isn't going to hurt the person that you stole it from.

56
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:26,760
It's going to hurt your website, and you can run the risk of getting sandboxed, blacklisted,

57
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,680
whatever you want to call it, deplatformed from Google.

58
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,920
They do not like that.

59
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,160
Do not plagiarize content.

60
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,160
It is not worth it.

61
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,160
It is not worth even risking.

62
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:40,240
Those are the little tips I want to share, and in the next videos, we're going to talk

63
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:48,280
about actually writing the content.
