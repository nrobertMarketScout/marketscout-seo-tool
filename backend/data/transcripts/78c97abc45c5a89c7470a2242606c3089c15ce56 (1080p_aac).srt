1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,380
I've had like, six, yeah, six cities now I've done concrete in

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:10,160
Florida. Okay. And all the DD the search volume checked out.

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,240
I mean, like, you know, when you search on SEM rush, you get like

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,560
the main number on the bottom left, you have related keywords.

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,220
I mean, add all those up. I mean, there were it was like

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,120
100 200 300 searches a month, right? So like, the search

7
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,380
volumes there, but it was getting no impressions after

8
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,400
like eight or nine days. So I just went ahead and pause those.

9
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,480
But um, and I took the number off a call rail, so I wasn't

10
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,560
paying for it. I don't know if that does anything for like

11
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:40,380
future payments anyway. Um, my question is, do you go back and

12
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:44,560
test those cities again? Maybe like two weeks down the road,

13
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,720
because maybe like the first time around for for whatever

14
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,600
reason, there was like a glitch in the algorithm or something

15
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,000
happened. And like the second time around, like it actually

16
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:57,360
performed really well for you. I don't make no sense for those

17
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,240
cities not to be getting zero impressions or two impressions,

18
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,400
three impressions, you know?

19
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,000
Yeah, I definitely will test them out. I'll circle back on

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,480
everything. I don't do it two weeks later, though, like I'll

21
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,600
wait a couple months. Okay, because I think it just my head,

22
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,960
I'm always like, I wonder if it has to do because I know, like

23
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,920
on paper, where, you know, you're really close to me. I'm

24
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,720
in, I'm in St. George in Vegas, we're basically like, it's 70

25
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,400
out there. And so I think, like, and I know what the weather is

26
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,980
like in Florida, but also, I, so I'm always like, let's, let's

27
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:32,880
like, wait till the next season and try it. So I'll pause and

28
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,080
unpause shit. Because, and that's the same way I and I do that.

29
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,080
Because when I used to sell door to door, there would be

30
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,160
neighborhoods that I would give up on, I'd go, I'd knock the

31
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,720
doors, and I had a bunch of freaking douchebags. I'm like,

32
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,200
oh, I screw this neighborhood, I'm never coming back. But then

33
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,680
like a couple months later, I'm like, now I'm going to go back

34
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,560
in there. And then I would get that first deal. And all of a

35
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,720
sudden, I would blow that neighborhood up. And I'm like,

36
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,800
okay, I'm glad I didn't give up on that. So I always serve you

37
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,920
guys, I did a training, like way back when my mood was in town,

38
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,560
on just working your areas. And that's the same for projects,

39
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,560
you guys have projects that like, you want to just pick and

40
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,440
shit on them and like get rid of them and burn into the ground.

41
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:17,760
Just relax, pause it, go get a deal. Get that momentum, come

42
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,920
back and work on it. And the same with ads, pause it, if you

43
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,300
get rid of your number, whatever, that's fine. And then

44
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,740
just come back, you know, a couple months down the road. So

45
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,780
I would definitely circle background, especially if like

46
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,620
the CPC lines up, and their search volume and the whole

47
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:34,380
deal, then I would just come back, I would definitely not

48
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:37,220
give up on that would come back. Because if not, you could shoot

49
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,340
them to me and I'll try them out.

50
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,020
Yeah, I'm definitely gonna try them out again. Because like I

51
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:45,940
said, everything is perfect. And these are cities that were like,

52
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,700
in between Central Florida to like Tampa. So if you're

53
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:55,140
familiar, you guys, so you got like Brandon Riverview, stuff

54
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:59,020
like that 100,000 population. I mean, and I have I have a

55
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,740
couple of sites, a few sites in Florida, like Gainesville,

56
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:06,940
Ocala, you know, Palm Coast, St. Augustine on the East Coast,

57
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:10,380
I have less population less search volume than those five

58
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,700
did. Yeah, and they were they were getting leads and

59
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,740
impressions left and right. Well, for those five or so, for

60
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,860
whatever reason, they just weren't getting any impressions.

61
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,180
Yeah, I don't know.

62
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:22,780
Think about it like this. Yeah, I have a site called Cedar City

63
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,940
concrete. I have a site Bentonville concrete, those are

64
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:29,100
30,000 population. And they're like they're getting 30 like

65
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:33,020
Cedar City is only getting probably like 10 to 20. But

66
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,620
Bentonville has been doing 30. There is concrete volume in

67
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:40,020
every city. I don't care where you're at. There's always going

68
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:43,060
to be some like at least 30,000 plus there's going to be concrete

69
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,020
volume. So yeah, if it's if you're talking 100,000

70
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:48,300
population, all the metrics are there. Come back and hit it

71
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,580
again. Okay.
