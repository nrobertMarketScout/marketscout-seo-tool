{"text": " All right, so the phone ain't ringing now what first of all if it's been 24 hours 12 hours Two days three days even four days and you're watching this video and going. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh Oh my gosh, stop turn off the video and wait a little longer Okay, but if it's been ten days or let's say say eight to ten days and nothing's happening. You're not getting any leads then Yeah, we let's dig in let's figure out what's going on So the first thing that we want to do is we got to figure out we got to diagnose the problem Okay, we're gonna figure out what is it that we're not getting? Okay, obviously, we're not getting leads But let's go back a little bit further. Let's see if it's deeper than that. Are we not getting leads? Okay, great So but are we getting clicks? Okay, so we're getting clicks but not leads so we can kind of look there. Are we getting impressions? Okay, so we're getting impressions, but not clicks So maybe it's there, you know, and we just start digging in layer by layer by layer But here is the key and this is very similar to when you're not closing deals You always want to look at the step or steps prior because that's where the issue is Okay, and so here's what you need to look at Okay If you are not getting and let me see if I can say this correctly if I if I don't say it correctly I will resay it and I'll tell you but I might mess this up Okay, but it just just hear me out. So if you are not getting leads But you're getting clicks. It's usually an issue with your landing page because think about it. People are clicking on your ads They're going to your page, but you're not converting them into calls. So it's usually a landing page issue. Okay now if you are getting impressions But you're not getting clicks It's usually an issue with your ad, right? Google is showing it to people they're putting it in front of people's faces That's the impressions but your ad copy is not grabbing them. And so that's why they're not Clicking on it. Okay, and so you just need to figure out like what is the issue? Because ultimately if we're not getting phone calls that is that's a problem That's that's what we need to figure out We want to go deeper and want to figure out what part of this we're actually Making a mistake. Okay, so that's number one is we're gonna diagnose where the issue is step two after you've diagnosed What part? Okay. Well, I'm getting impressions, but I'm not getting clicks or I'm getting clicks But I'm not getting calls What I want you to do is I want you to go and watch The video prior the video prior to this or the two prior to this or whatever video you need to watch that talks about That specific topic. So if you're having an issue with The landing page because you're getting clicks, but you're not getting calls You're gonna want to go and watch the module that talks about That building the landing page you're gonna talk. It's called money love speed That's the module you're gonna want to watch the infamous one pager Okay, if you're having a problem with some other area go watch that video So I want you to go and watch that video Whatever one it is and figure out is it something that you skipped whether on accident or on purpose because most often what I found Is that it's not because what we trained isn't working It's because you did something incorrect Maybe you set up the landing page and you thought you did everything correctly But you look at it and the phone number is nowhere to be found You had all the intention of the world of putting the phone number on there But it's just nowhere to be found or maybe it's right there, but it's not clickable or maybe it's clickable But it's not underlined. It's not highlighted and so no one's clicking on it. Maybe you didn't put the form Maybe the four like there's so many different variables I want you to go and rewatch that specific video that pertains to that step or covers that step and make sure you're doing it Exactly how it's trained in that video Okay, because until you do that we're not gonna be able to know and I'm telling you most often 99% of the time You're gonna figure out what you're doing wrong. You're gonna go. Let's say let's say you're getting impressions, but you're not getting clicks You're gonna go look at your ad copy and you're gonna go. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. I put I spelled the city wrong I put Queen Creek and I spelled it. I spelled Creek wrong I added an E and people are seeing it and they like oh my gosh, who's this incompetent business, right? So go first of all step one diagnosed step two go watch the video That talks about and trains on the part that you're messing up. Okay based on your diagnosis step three I'm gonna ask you to go into the Facebook community and Search the group okay I'm gonna have you search the group and look for conversations related to what you're having an issue with So if you're having an issue with your landing page I want you to go into this search bar at the very top corner a little magnifying glass and type click on it and type landing page one pager Whatever Weebly site or any keyword that you think people would type in when they're referring to The page that we eventually throw away the landing page that we use and then we eventually throw away and I want you to search for conversations around that and the reason I'm gonna direct you here instead of immediately just reaching out to fix it Felix or reaching Out to me or reaching out to somebody else is because guys I'm trying to turn you into entrepreneurs I'm trying to see how many millionaires I can create in this group and you just messaging me and me spoon-feeding you the answer First of all, it's not it doesn't work like mathematically. I don't have the time but number two. It's not teaching you anything Okay, I want you to be a problem solver. I want you to be able to go. Okay I diagnosed the issue. I Went and watched the video and now I'm gonna go search the group and search these conversations to see that see if I can figure It out on my own because what happens when you have this problem? It's 2 a.m. In the morning and everybody's asleep Okay, all right. You don't have the option to reach out to people Okay, I want you to be a problem solver. And so I'm first after you've diagnosed it after you've watched the video I want you to go and I want you to search the group and look for threads look for Conversations about the thing that you're struggling with whether it's the ad copy whether it's the one pager whether it's Setting up the ad properly get a location or whatever You've diagnosed as the issue number four the fourth thing that I want you to do is if you go in and you've done all These things you've diagnosed it. You've watched the video. You've searched the group. You've looked at the conversation You've responded to it and you're still stuck Go and make a post go and make a post. It says hey guys, I Have X amount of clicks and no leads and I've done this this this and this and I'm just not figuring this out Could somebody give me some insight and you're free to tag fix it Felix. Okay, you're free to tag me as well I'm just gonna be honest. I'll get to it as fast as I can but I am trying my best to use my time the best The best to benefit everybody. Okay, so tagging fix that Felix is gonna be your best option But go and make a post and be very thorough be very specific about it and ask people for help say hey Here's what's going on. I've done this this isn't this and I still can't figure it out Is there anybody that can help me and maybe what you can do is you can look and go? There's some of those threads some of those comments I looked at that was Jeff, you know Jeff was having that issue So maybe you go and you can tag Jeff, you know, yeah after you post it at Jeff Hey Jeff, I noticed you were having some similar issues. You have any insight on this Use your head and go and post. I'm telling you if you do those four steps and You again, this is I just should even go without saying but I'm gonna say it make sure that this isn't you just completely didn't skip Module one where I said don't go into these niches look out for this, you know, look out for that, etc Then you are going to figure this out some other things to take into account and they're easier to forget during the summer Which it's summer right now and I'm filming this in the winter. It's really easy is I also want you to think about the winter I want you to think about the the the weather right now I know in Australia and some other places winter is different different time of the year But think about it, right use your head go look at the forecast You're running concrete ads and it's December and and you're in Minneapolis Okay, first of all, you should probably shouldn't be in Minneapolis But let's say you are let's say for some weird reason that the due diligence works and it's a low-hanging fruit layup Guys who's searching for concrete who's even thinking about putting in concrete during Christmas? Nobody wants to go spend money on concrete during Christmas That's something you spend for most homeowners after they get their tax returns back when it's spring cleanup when people are getting back into Backyards and cleaning up the yard and do all those things use your head go look at the last 10 days weather Could that be affecting it? Is there a hurt? Are you in Florida and there's a damn hurricane? Okay Are you in Arkansas and there has been a tornado look at these different factors and also this is something to consider And I guess I I almost skip over this because it just makes sense in my head But don't look okay If this was in your city is there something that's happening in your city that there's probably not that many people searching that weekend Is it the Ironman that weekend go and use your head and look at those things? But if you use your head you've done the the the module one correctly you've picked the perfect niche You've you've found a layup and you've done those four things guys. We're gonna figure this out I promise you there's always a solution and we will figure this out That's it", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 16.92, "text": " All right, so the phone ain't ringing now what first of all if it's been 24 hours 12 hours", "tokens": [50364, 1057, 558, 11, 370, 264, 2593, 7862, 380, 18423, 586, 437, 700, 295, 439, 498, 309, 311, 668, 4022, 2496, 2272, 2496, 51210], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.28557484185517723, "compression_ratio": 1.5304878048780488, "no_speech_prob": 0.0038152821362018585}, {"id": 1, "seek": 0, "start": 16.92, "end": 21.86, "text": " Two days three days even four days and you're watching this video and going.
