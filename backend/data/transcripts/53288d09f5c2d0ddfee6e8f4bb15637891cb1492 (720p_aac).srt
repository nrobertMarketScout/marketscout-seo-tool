1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
And then it also, I think the other thing too, it depends how many leads have you sent him?

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,160
Is this your first lead? Is this your fifth lead? Because if I've already set this guy three,

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,920
four leads, you got to remember guys, you don't need to wait until they close a job,

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,600
until they close a lead to go and run the call, right? Like Porter, did that guy close any of

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,960
those deals you sent him? No, his estimates are today. So he hasn't even done one.

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,280
I was just going to say, and sometimes you're going to send them a few leads. They're not even

7
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,240
going to get to the leads and you're going to close them. And you could just tell one of the

8
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:37,200
reasons Porter, Porter's got a really good example right now of momentum, the power of momentum. You

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,640
get that deal and you get that second deal and you get that third deal and you get that fourth

10
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,840
deal. Then you get that fifth deal. And my guess is his sixth and seventh deal. He's two deals away

11
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:53,120
from hitting 10 K guys in two and a half, three months. So that question, Theo, it depends on what

12
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:59,440
lead number you're at. And if you're asking like, like, are you asking because you're worried that

13
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,440
it's going to sound like you're desperate or are you asking because you think you should just send

14
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,200
it before he actually talks to the homeowner? I'm not really sure what you're asking, but just

15
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,000
remember you don't need them to close a lead. You actually don't even need them to run the lead.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,200
You just like, if it feels right, it feels right. And you just go for it. Okay.
