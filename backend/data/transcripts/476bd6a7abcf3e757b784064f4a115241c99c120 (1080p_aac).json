{"text": " The point of us doing the one-pager is we want to see how the market's going to react. We want to see, before I go spend money on a domain and all this stuff and actual content, I want to see what kind of volume I'm going to get for my ads. I want to see if I can get a business owner on the hook that's going to pay and fund my property. That's why I do it. Now, if you've done really strong due diligence, you're confident in it, no problem.
