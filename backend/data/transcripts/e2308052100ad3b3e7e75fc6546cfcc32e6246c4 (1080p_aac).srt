00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
Pick a contract length. Decide, are you going to do a contract? In my opinion, you're crazy

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:10,880
not to do a contract. Pick a contract length and say, I'm doing this contract. I'm not giving them

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,040
the option of month to month. I'm not giving them the option of what type of contract. We're doing

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,800
one contract and we're doing a contract. For me, it was a six-month contract. Now, you go in and

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,800
they won't agree to a contract and you have to do a three-month instead of a six-month to get the

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,240
deal. Fine. But you have it in your head. You're only going to do one. You're only going to focus

7
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,240
on when you're going to pitch one.
