WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.600
Okay, guys, let's talk about how passive this model really is, and I'm going to be speaking

00:09.600 --> 00:15.640
to those of you that maybe are brand new to this group, like a Kurt Dahlstrom.

00:15.640 --> 00:18.660
Maybe I'm speaking to you that have been in this group for a minute.

00:18.660 --> 00:20.920
You understand the model.

00:20.920 --> 00:26.140
You might even have started building your first project, or maybe you've even landed

00:26.140 --> 00:31.580
your first client, but you haven't really seen how passive this can become.

00:31.580 --> 00:35.320
It's really important, Kurt Thomas, welcome from Cleveland, Ohio, welcome to The Call.

00:35.320 --> 00:39.860
It's very easy for people to toss around the term passive, passive income, passive income,

00:39.860 --> 00:42.020
passive income.

00:42.020 --> 00:47.340
First and foremost, everyone's old enough and mature enough, and hopefully has enough

00:47.340 --> 00:53.660
experience to realize there's really no such thing as 100% passivity, okay?

00:53.660 --> 00:59.300
There's varying degrees of passivity, but there's not passive or non-passive.

00:59.300 --> 01:01.940
It's just degrees, okay?

01:01.940 --> 01:05.020
Even regular real estate is not completely passive.

01:05.020 --> 01:06.900
You got to evict people sometimes.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.220
You got to fix this.

01:08.220 --> 01:09.220
You got to fix that.

01:09.220 --> 01:14.120
You got to raise prices, re-sign contracts.

01:14.120 --> 01:16.300
It's never 100% pass, okay?

01:16.300 --> 01:19.300
Nothing is, and I'm not going to lie to you guys, for those of you that are new, for those

01:19.300 --> 01:22.220
of you that are exploring this model, or for those of you that have gotten into it but

01:22.540 --> 01:25.620
haven't quite gotten that website ranked, I'm not going to lie and say it's completely

01:25.620 --> 01:27.980
passive because nothing is completely passive, okay?

01:27.980 --> 01:30.980
So we're going to start there.

01:30.980 --> 01:37.420
Also, what I would like to do is give away a little bit of swag.

01:37.420 --> 01:43.540
Let me see if I can show everybody, let me see if I can show everybody what we got, okay?

01:43.540 --> 01:48.260
First and foremost, some of the stuff that we have, we have the t-shirts, we have the

01:48.260 --> 01:54.900
mouse pads, we have the AirPod cases, we have the coffee mugs, we have the stickers.

01:54.900 --> 01:58.100
We got a few little knickknacks, whatever, that can sit on your desk.

01:58.100 --> 02:00.940
We got some hoodies, some hats.

02:00.940 --> 02:02.940
So we're going to be giving away some swag today.

02:02.940 --> 02:07.460
So I appreciate you guys being active on the call.

02:07.460 --> 02:11.340
I'm going to be choosing a few winners and give away some stuff, okay?

02:11.340 --> 02:13.460
So just stick with me.

02:13.460 --> 02:18.180
There's Nick Bass, Nick Bassaraba from Canada as well, and we're going to be talking about

02:18.180 --> 02:21.380
a bunch of stuff today, but I'm going to also be doing that, okay?

02:21.380 --> 02:26.340
So for those of you that maybe are new to this group, Kurt, some of you guys have heard

02:26.340 --> 02:28.020
my story, some of you haven't.

02:28.020 --> 02:33.180
I'm not going to share it again, but if you watch any of my content, you'll hear the story.

02:33.180 --> 02:34.900
Been doing this eight years.

02:34.900 --> 02:42.020
I've made by renting, by building and renting simple websites, have made well over a million

02:42.020 --> 02:47.640
dollars for the past four years, with the exception of 2020 and 2021.

02:47.640 --> 02:51.440
Those years, we made a million in 2020, just over.

02:51.440 --> 02:59.800
We did 1.45, 1.5 in 2021, but it's been well over that since, and we will never go back.

02:59.800 --> 03:05.160
But I want you guys to know that we made this money, we're making this money doing the model

03:05.160 --> 03:09.160
that we're teaching in this program, which is building and renting simple websites.

03:09.160 --> 03:11.140
And that's what you need to know about me.

03:11.140 --> 03:15.280
That's what you should be asking yourself is why the heck should I listen to this guy

03:15.360 --> 03:20.760
who's just another, you know, somebody full of crap, whatever, you know, it's crazy how

03:20.760 --> 03:24.800
distrusting I am and how distrusting guys, let me tell you the most hilarious thing that

03:24.800 --> 03:30.440
happened about a month and about five weeks ago, it was just before I went to Dubai.

03:30.440 --> 03:34.880
And my, I have, I have a Lamborghini Huracan parked in my garage.

03:34.880 --> 03:38.720
By the way, I waited until I could pay completely just cash for this thing, or else I wasn't

03:38.720 --> 03:39.720
going to do it.

03:39.720 --> 03:40.720
And this, I bought this thing.

03:40.720 --> 03:45.200
It'd be a year on October 31st, like it's been almost a year guys in 2020.

03:46.120 --> 03:47.760
I've driven it three times.

03:47.760 --> 03:48.760
Okay.

03:48.760 --> 03:53.000
One of those times was about five weeks ago, my son was going to school.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
There's only two seats.

03:54.000 --> 03:57.440
You can't even take all the kids, but he's like, yeah, let's take the car, drop me off

03:57.440 --> 03:58.440
in the Lamborghini.

03:58.440 --> 03:59.440
I'm like, okay, cool.

03:59.440 --> 04:01.720
Pull up, drop him off.

04:01.720 --> 04:04.080
His friends are going crazy, whatever.

04:04.080 --> 04:08.840
And I was talking about their school and he goes, yeah, my buddies, my buddies, they asked

04:08.840 --> 04:12.160
me if you rent, if you were renting the Lamborghini.

04:12.160 --> 04:16.000
And I just, I laugh and he didn't even know that was a thing, which is good.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.880
But he's, he told, I said, what'd you say?

04:17.880 --> 04:20.720
He's like, yeah, I just told him, I don't think that's even an option.

04:20.720 --> 04:24.480
The point that I'm making guys is there's so much fake stuff out there that even people

04:24.480 --> 04:29.880
that are even these 10, 11, 12 year old kids, they see a sports car and they just assume

04:29.880 --> 04:30.880
the person's fake.

04:30.880 --> 04:32.760
They assume that they're renting the Lamborghini.

04:32.760 --> 04:34.120
They assume that they're full of crap.

04:34.120 --> 04:37.880
And so you can look at that as a bad thing or a good thing.

04:37.880 --> 04:40.040
I look at it as, as who cares?

04:40.560 --> 04:45.400
I want you guys to be distrusting because if you trust me and just take my word for

04:45.400 --> 04:46.880
it, you're going to trust everybody after me.

04:46.880 --> 04:50.160
So I want you to listen to what I'm saying.

04:50.160 --> 04:52.880
When you get to be in business for a little while, you can tell if somebody's full of

04:52.880 --> 04:55.400
crap or if they've actually been there and done that.

04:55.400 --> 05:00.120
And I want you to like, does, does your gut tell you like, does you feel, does it feel

05:00.120 --> 05:01.120
natural?

05:01.120 --> 05:03.040
Does it feel like I'm making it up?

05:03.040 --> 05:06.040
And if you don't feel like what I'm saying is true, I don't, I don't want you to be on

05:06.040 --> 05:07.040
these calls.

05:07.040 --> 05:09.280
I don't, I don't want you to have to pretend or to fake or whatever.

05:09.280 --> 05:13.960
I want you to question everything and every group you are online and every person that

05:13.960 --> 05:14.960
you hear.

05:14.960 --> 05:18.880
And so I wanted to start by letting you know, I've made millions and millions of dollars

05:18.880 --> 05:22.200
doing the business model of building simple websites and renting them out for passive

05:22.200 --> 05:23.200
income.

05:23.200 --> 05:24.520
That's why I'm here talking to you guys.

05:24.520 --> 05:25.520
Okay.

05:25.520 --> 05:26.520
Not because I think I'm smart.

05:26.520 --> 05:30.080
Not because of this, that or whatever, it's because I've actually done it and I'm continuing

05:30.080 --> 05:31.080
to do it.

05:31.080 --> 05:32.080
Okay.

05:32.080 --> 05:36.080
So what I want to do, my goal by the end of this call, we're going to do like, I'd say

05:36.080 --> 05:37.920
about 20 to 25 minutes.

05:37.920 --> 05:40.280
I'm going to talk about this passivity.

05:40.280 --> 05:42.520
How passive is this model?

05:42.520 --> 05:44.640
And then we're going to go into some Q&A stuff.

05:44.640 --> 05:48.840
Also throughout this call, if you guys have Q&A that's relevant, I want to answer it as

05:48.840 --> 05:50.040
we go.

05:50.040 --> 05:53.400
I know we're not on a zoom call, but I would like this to be more back and forth.

05:53.400 --> 05:59.280
So don't wait until I'm done to ask your questions, ask them, especially if it's related to what

05:59.280 --> 06:00.280
I'm talking about.

06:00.280 --> 06:01.280
Okay.

06:01.280 --> 06:05.560
But again, my goal for this, this episode or it's not really an episode, but this, this

06:05.880 --> 06:10.360
call today is that I want you guys by the end to know exactly how passive this model

06:10.360 --> 06:13.680
is and then you can base your decisions off of that.

06:13.680 --> 06:14.680
Okay.

06:14.680 --> 06:15.680
No BS, no fluff, et cetera.

06:15.680 --> 06:16.680
Okay.

06:16.680 --> 06:19.040
So here's some of the stuff that we're going to cover, guys.

06:19.040 --> 06:21.120
We're going to be talking about how nothing's truly passive.

06:21.120 --> 06:22.120
Just a tiny bit more.

06:22.120 --> 06:23.120
I've already talked about that.

06:23.120 --> 06:27.560
We're going to talk about where most of the work with this business model comes.

06:27.560 --> 06:31.240
Then we're going to be talking about the most important step of the process.

06:31.240 --> 06:34.880
Then we're going to be talking about different clients and how each client is not created

06:35.200 --> 06:36.200
equally.

06:36.200 --> 06:40.320
Then I'm going to show you guys and talk to you about some of my most passive websites.

06:40.320 --> 06:45.440
Then I'm going to talk to you about why I believe this is the most passive, what, sorry,

06:45.440 --> 06:50.620
why I believe this is such a passive model, why it's, why it can be that passive.

06:50.620 --> 06:52.440
And then I'm going to give you guys a little bit of bonus at the end and we're going to

06:52.440 --> 06:53.440
wrap this up and do some Q&A.

06:53.440 --> 06:54.440
Okay.

06:54.440 --> 06:57.880
So I want to get into it really, really quick, but as usual, I completely forgot to turn

06:57.880 --> 07:00.680
my AC off or on, so give me one second.

07:00.680 --> 07:03.360
It's still like a hundred and freaking something here.

07:03.840 --> 07:04.840
Give me one sec.

07:04.840 --> 07:05.840
Hold on.

07:22.840 --> 07:27.000
All right, guys, let's talk about passive, the passivity of this business model.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
Okay.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.680
As I already mentioned, nothing is completely passive.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.680
And by the way, I actually want to ask this question.

07:33.680 --> 07:38.040
If anybody on this call right now, there's 10 of you guys on, if anybody knows of a model

07:38.040 --> 07:42.440
that is completely 100% passive, I would love for you guys to let me know in the comments.

07:42.440 --> 07:43.440
Okay.

07:43.440 --> 07:46.480
Because to my knowledge, there is nothing that is passive, 100%.

07:46.480 --> 07:47.480
Okay.

07:47.480 --> 07:51.120
Does anyone know of any, any business model out there?

07:51.120 --> 07:56.800
TikTok shop, from TikTok shop to whatever, does anyone know of a business model that

07:56.800 --> 07:57.800
is completely passive?

07:57.800 --> 07:58.800
Matthew Torres, welcome to the call.

08:00.800 --> 08:05.600
I'm going to wait.

08:05.600 --> 08:08.680
Does anybody know of a business model that is completely passive?

08:08.680 --> 08:14.320
John, John Galenvo, I think.

08:14.320 --> 08:18.520
Sean Sean is also in.

08:18.520 --> 08:20.320
Kurt says just failure.

08:20.320 --> 08:24.280
Yeah, that's passive.

08:24.280 --> 08:26.320
Luke Pritchard, what's on, or what's going on, man?

08:26.320 --> 08:28.720
Luke Pritchard was our winner of our recent scholarship.

08:28.760 --> 08:31.920
Shout out to Luke in Australia.

08:31.920 --> 08:35.680
So guys, as I'm continuing, if you guys can think of anything that's 100% passive, please

08:35.680 --> 08:36.680
let me know.

08:36.680 --> 08:37.680
But to my knowledge, there's no such thing.

08:37.680 --> 08:38.680
Okay.

08:38.680 --> 08:41.660
As I mentioned before, there's, there's nothing that's completely passive.

08:41.660 --> 08:43.880
There's varying degrees of passivity.

08:43.880 --> 08:47.120
And on the one hand, there's something, there's things that are not passive at all.

08:47.120 --> 08:49.560
On the other hand, there's things that are very passive.

08:49.560 --> 08:54.320
And we're going to talk about where on the scale this business model actually ends up.

08:54.320 --> 08:55.320
Okay.

08:55.680 --> 08:58.920
For those of you that have never done this, what you need to understand about this business

08:58.920 --> 09:06.560
model is that all of the work of this business model is front loaded and it is very, very

09:06.560 --> 09:07.560
front loaded.

09:07.560 --> 09:08.560
Okay.

09:08.560 --> 09:12.320
It's not like you do a certain amount here and then you do a certain amount in the middle

09:12.320 --> 09:13.960
and then a little bit at the end.

09:13.960 --> 09:20.060
It is almost entirely front loaded and it seems like a lot in the beginning.

09:20.060 --> 09:24.140
But if you can get to the point where you can get the client, get the website ranking,

09:24.140 --> 09:30.500
get the ads turned down a bit, you can create something that is pretty darn passive.

09:30.500 --> 09:33.860
Jason Allred says nothing is passive.

09:33.860 --> 09:37.060
I don't think so either, but if somebody can correct me, that'd be great.

09:37.060 --> 09:38.060
Okay.

09:38.060 --> 09:39.060
Guys.

09:39.060 --> 09:43.940
The reason why this is such a front loaded business is because, I'm going to say this,

09:43.940 --> 09:46.700
the biggest thing which we're going to, I don't want to jump ahead too much, but the

09:46.700 --> 09:49.460
biggest thing that you got to start with is you got to pick the right city and you got

09:49.460 --> 09:50.460
to pick the right industry.

09:50.460 --> 09:53.700
If you don't pick the right city and the right industry, you're dead in the water.

09:53.700 --> 09:54.700
Okay.

09:54.700 --> 09:55.700
I know some of you guys have been in this long enough.

09:55.700 --> 09:58.900
You're like, yeah, we already know this, but I don't know if you actually understand how

09:58.900 --> 10:00.300
important this is.

10:00.300 --> 10:03.660
What happens is when you first get into this model, you're so anxious to get your first

10:03.660 --> 10:04.660
website up.

10:04.660 --> 10:09.800
You're so anxious to just get going, which I respect and I love, but you go and you go

10:09.800 --> 10:14.180
into the wrong city, you go into the wrong niche and then you're like, I can't get my

10:14.180 --> 10:19.140
website to rank or my website's ranking, it's not producing leads or my website's ranking,

10:19.140 --> 10:21.460
it's producing leads, but I can't find a hungry business owner.

10:21.500 --> 10:23.900
Any one of those options does not equal money.

10:23.900 --> 10:27.300
So guys, you have to know how to do due diligence.

10:27.300 --> 10:29.260
You have to know how to pick a city and how to pick a niche.

10:29.260 --> 10:35.220
Some of you guys think that just because you research something and the CPC is below $5,

10:35.220 --> 10:40.100
which for those of you who have no idea what I'm talking about, I'm coming, just chill,

10:40.100 --> 10:41.260
that you're just going to go into it.

10:41.260 --> 10:42.340
That's not the case, guys.

10:42.340 --> 10:51.420
It took me from 2016 to 2020, mid-2020, before I felt like I had a process for picking a

10:51.420 --> 10:56.660
city and a niche, that was bulletproof and the only reason I was able to develop it is

10:56.660 --> 10:59.540
because I went into so many of the wrong cities and so many of the wrong niches.

10:59.540 --> 11:04.460
I went into 50 different cities in the wrong niche, okay, 50.

11:04.460 --> 11:07.580
I don't know how many times I've been into a city and a niche that looked good and I've

11:07.580 --> 11:09.900
come to find out it's not good, okay.

11:09.900 --> 11:12.980
I've made the mistakes, I've done all those things and that's how I know what the model

11:12.980 --> 11:13.980
is.

11:13.980 --> 11:16.660
So you got to, you know, it's front-loaded because you got to pick the city, you got

11:16.660 --> 11:19.380
to pick the niche, you got to make sure that's perfect.

11:19.420 --> 11:22.660
Then you got to also, you know, let's say you got to land the client.

11:22.660 --> 11:26.740
The way that I teach it is I go, I get a client first, I get the contract, I get the credit

11:26.740 --> 11:27.740
contract, you got to get the client.

11:27.740 --> 11:31.180
Then once you get the client, you got to build a website and after you build the website,

11:31.180 --> 11:34.220
you got to do the SEO and the content and da-da-da-da-da and then you got to do the

11:34.220 --> 11:37.140
backlinks, you got to get this ranked, you got to keep the client happy.

11:37.140 --> 11:42.780
But guys, once you get to the point where you've built the website, you got the deal,

11:42.780 --> 11:46.020
okay, and these are not in any specific order because you guys know that I get the client

11:46.020 --> 11:47.540
first and then I get the website.

11:47.700 --> 11:52.020
But once you get to the point where you do those things, you have a website, you have

11:52.020 --> 11:56.900
a client and the client has been with you that initial six months, okay?

11:56.900 --> 11:59.780
What I do at that point is I roll them into another contract.

11:59.780 --> 12:03.820
So they're with me six months and then I'm like, hey, does this sound like, is it going

12:03.820 --> 12:06.780
good because for me it looks good, I would like to continue with you, are you going to

12:06.780 --> 12:07.780
continue with me?

12:07.780 --> 12:08.780
Yes, okay, sounds good.

12:08.780 --> 12:09.980
Here's what we're going to do.

12:09.980 --> 12:15.060
We're going to extend this out a year and I'm going to lock in your rate for you.

12:15.060 --> 12:21.940
And guys, I'm telling you that if you can just get business owners, keep them happy,

12:21.940 --> 12:27.740
get them to that six month mark and get them into a second contract, even if it's six months,

12:27.740 --> 12:30.340
but I try to get them into a year contract right away.

12:30.340 --> 12:33.100
So then I'm always on yearly contracts, right?

12:33.100 --> 12:36.380
Once you get past that initial contract, if you can get them to sign into another one

12:36.380 --> 12:40.460
and you've done your homework, you've done your SEO, you've done your website, this is

12:40.460 --> 12:42.100
where the business model becomes fun.

12:42.140 --> 12:45.980
This is where the business model becomes very, very passive and this is where everything

12:45.980 --> 12:48.700
opens up and you can start to really scale, okay?

12:48.700 --> 12:52.300
But I'm here to tell you that all the work is going to come in that first six months

12:52.300 --> 12:56.900
and inside of that first six months, 90% of that work is going to come inside the first

12:56.900 --> 12:59.460
month, because that's when you're going to be landing the client, when you're going to

12:59.460 --> 13:02.220
be doing the due diligence, when you're going to be sending the leads, when you're going

13:02.220 --> 13:03.220
to be setting up the website.

13:03.220 --> 13:06.500
And then once you get the website, you start doing the content, then you're just slowly

13:06.660 --> 13:12.460
dripping out backlinks or updating this, that, adding a photo, doing a blog, whatever, and

13:12.460 --> 13:13.460
it's not that much.

13:13.460 --> 13:17.020
So in the first six months is all of the work.

13:17.020 --> 13:18.860
All of the work is in the first six months.

13:18.860 --> 13:23.100
Inside of those six months, inside the first month, maybe even say 45 days to be safe,

13:23.100 --> 13:28.020
inside the first 45 days of the first six months is where all the work comes and it

13:28.020 --> 13:32.780
slowly begins to get lighter and lighter and easier and easier, okay?

13:32.820 --> 13:37.700
So you guys need to understand that this business model is frontloaded, okay?

13:37.700 --> 13:43.140
Now Scott Gray asked the golden question.

13:43.140 --> 13:46.540
He said, how do you pick the city and niche?

13:46.540 --> 13:48.300
Very carefully, my friend, very carefully.

13:48.300 --> 13:56.860
I'm going to give you guys a couple of criteria, but again, guys, that is, there's no way

13:56.860 --> 13:58.580
I could answer that on this call.

13:58.580 --> 14:02.380
Even if we had an hour call dedicated to that question, then there's no way I could even

14:02.380 --> 14:03.380
touch it.

14:03.380 --> 14:04.860
It is something that is an exact process.

14:04.860 --> 14:09.780
That's something that we teach inside Digital Landlords, however, you don't have to be inside

14:09.780 --> 14:10.780
Digital Landlords.

14:10.780 --> 14:12.340
You can go develop your own due diligence.

14:12.340 --> 14:17.220
You can go develop your own system for picking a city and a niche, but it's going to require

14:17.220 --> 14:23.380
you to be willing to fail on a lot of projects, be willing to not rank on a lot of projects.

14:23.380 --> 14:26.740
So a couple of things, though, guys, on the niche.

14:26.740 --> 14:30.100
I'm a big believer, you guys have heard me say this before, go into the boring, tried

14:30.100 --> 14:32.700
and true niches until you get till your bills are paid.

14:32.700 --> 14:37.420
If your bills are 10K a month, you probably need to make about $15,000, $16,000 gross

14:37.420 --> 14:41.740
to net that because you're going to have some ad spend in there if you're going to pre-sell.

14:41.740 --> 14:46.140
So until you get to like $15,000, $16,000 per month gross, I wouldn't even worry about

14:46.140 --> 14:47.140
changing niches.

14:47.140 --> 14:52.580
I would stay in the basic niches, the concrete, the spray foam, the masonry, artificial grass,

14:52.580 --> 14:57.900
the fencing, the, you know, duct cleaning, the gutter installation, the basic tried and

14:57.900 --> 14:58.900
true niches first.

14:58.940 --> 15:00.780
Okay, that's what I'd say in terms of the niches.

15:03.820 --> 15:06.220
Picking a city, I'll give you a couple of tips.

15:06.220 --> 15:17.420
Number one, population does not matter, search volume does, growing areas, if you know that

15:17.420 --> 15:21.540
it's a growing area because you've lived there, you have family there, you have some kind

15:21.540 --> 15:28.100
of intel, maybe you're a lumber salesman and you like know that the top performing reps

15:28.100 --> 15:34.220
are in Bentonville, Arkansas and you're like, oh, that's weird, it must be a huge boom.

15:34.220 --> 15:38.100
That's interesting, you're going to be, there's a lot of population, so that means that most

15:38.100 --> 15:42.940
of the time for these basic services, there's going to be an increase in demand, right,

15:42.940 --> 15:45.060
because the area is growing.

15:45.060 --> 15:49.700
Another thing on city is typically the lower the population, the lower the competition,

15:49.700 --> 15:52.540
but that's not always the case.

15:52.540 --> 15:54.300
What else can I say in terms of city?

15:54.380 --> 15:58.220
I would definitely highly, highly, highly and strongly recommend that whatever city

15:58.220 --> 16:04.740
you go into, that the average cost per click is less than $5 and if that doesn't mean anything

16:04.740 --> 16:09.060
to you, it doesn't make any sense at all, you haven't watched enough content, but it

16:09.060 --> 16:13.780
will, those are some of my criteria, but everyone wants to talk about population and this, that,

16:13.780 --> 16:17.500
the rest, oh, the other thing I would mention, try not to go in cities and states that are

16:17.500 --> 16:19.500
super seasonal, okay?

16:19.500 --> 16:23.940
I try to stay out of North Dakota, I try to stay out of Minnesota, I try to stay out of

16:23.940 --> 16:29.980
stuff that's so extreme, Chicago, it's very hot, it's very cold and it's swinging and

16:29.980 --> 16:32.860
all of a sudden you've got these contractors that don't want to work and all this stuff,

16:32.860 --> 16:37.660
that's just some of the things I would recommend without giving you all the secret sauce, okay?

16:37.660 --> 16:38.660
There you go.

16:38.660 --> 16:41.660
Scott, does that answer your question?

16:41.660 --> 16:47.180
Okay, we've got another question.

16:47.180 --> 16:52.620
Munib Kashif says one question, if there's no ads running in your niche and also there

16:52.660 --> 16:58.100
are businesses ranked organically, is it a flag not to get in there, especially if you're

16:58.100 --> 16:59.100
beginning?

16:59.100 --> 17:03.660
If there's ads in your niche and there's also businesses ranked organically, there's always

17:03.660 --> 17:07.660
going to be businesses ranked organically, dog, somebody's got to be ranked organically,

17:07.660 --> 17:11.340
so that's not a red flag for me, if I see businesses ranked organically, then that's

17:11.340 --> 17:16.740
just part of Google, somebody has to rank at the top of Google, you know, even if it's

17:16.740 --> 17:22.060
crappy competition, they're still taking your traffic, so I don't worry as much about that

17:22.060 --> 17:27.380
and also if people are running ads, no, that doesn't scare me at all.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.100
If people are running ads, you know what that means?

17:29.100 --> 17:32.580
That means that they've got some hungry business owners that I'm going to go sell to, I'm going

17:32.580 --> 17:37.140
to go sell my service to these hungry business owners, so absolutely not, is that a red flag

17:37.140 --> 17:38.140
in my opinion, okay?

17:38.140 --> 17:39.140
Good question.

17:39.140 --> 17:42.460
If anyone has any more questions, keep dropping the questions, these are good questions, they're

17:42.460 --> 17:46.180
relevant questions, I appreciate them, okay?

17:46.180 --> 17:49.500
Next thing I want to talk about really, really quick, guys, is just to reiterate a little

17:49.540 --> 17:56.540
bit more, is if you pick the right city and you pick the right niche, once you are ranked,

17:56.540 --> 18:01.180
this business requires very little work, it's kind of like climbing a mountain, okay?

18:01.180 --> 18:04.340
And what I mean by that, if you guys have ever climbed a mountain, it's like this huge

18:04.340 --> 18:09.140
steep ascension and you get, you're climbing, you're grabbing branches, you're falling down,

18:09.140 --> 18:13.740
you're getting dirty, whatever, whatever, you just claw your way to the top and it's

18:13.820 --> 18:20.820
a real pain, and then once you get to the top, to stay at the top is very easy, right?

18:20.820 --> 18:24.860
A lot of times these hills, they're flat at the top, whatever, once you get to the top,

18:24.860 --> 18:29.540
to stay at the top, it's easy, it's very, very easy, right?

18:29.540 --> 18:33.180
It's the climb that's so hard, and so you guys need to understand that even though you've

18:33.180 --> 18:37.420
got all this front-load of work, you've got six months of hard work and probably 45 days

18:37.420 --> 18:42.220
of really hard work in the very beginning, guys, once you get to the top of this mountain,

18:42.220 --> 18:47.020
once you get to that six-month mark, websites ranking, clients in the year two or the second

18:47.020 --> 18:52.580
contract, this business model becomes very, very passive, okay?

18:52.580 --> 18:57.220
And I've got plenty of different examples for you guys that I can share, but I just

18:57.220 --> 19:00.780
want you guys to understand that you've got to remember that picking that right city in

19:00.780 --> 19:06.820
that right niche is so vital because it changes the entire freaking game, and if you don't

19:06.820 --> 19:12.620
pick the right city in the right niche, from experience, everything becomes harder, okay?

19:12.620 --> 19:14.780
Now let's talk really quick.

19:14.780 --> 19:19.780
I want to let you guys know that not all clients are created equally, okay?

19:19.780 --> 19:23.540
Not all clients, and the truth is that once you get to the top of Google, you're pretty

19:23.540 --> 19:25.820
well going to stay ranked at the top of Google.

19:25.820 --> 19:30.500
Unless somebody comes in, it's like a really popular city, it's a big city, and you attract

19:30.500 --> 19:34.620
some big competition, most likely you're not going to get overtaken, and even if you do,

19:34.620 --> 19:37.540
you're going to get bumped down one spot, you do a little bit of SEO, you're back up,

19:37.540 --> 19:38.540
okay?

19:38.540 --> 19:41.300
It's not going to be that difficult once you get ranked to stay at the top.

19:41.300 --> 19:48.520
However, okay, however, business owners are a different story, yeah?

19:48.520 --> 19:49.660
Business owners are a different story.

19:49.660 --> 19:53.140
You could be at the top of Google, you could be producing the most amount of leads, and

19:53.140 --> 19:57.260
you could have the most high-maintenance business owner on the planet, and that is going to

19:57.260 --> 20:02.020
make this one of the most least passive business models on the planet because of your business

20:02.020 --> 20:03.020
owner, okay?

20:03.420 --> 20:07.020
I've had some of the best business owners that I don't talk to ever, that I literally

20:07.020 --> 20:13.420
talk to once every two years, once every three years, and I'm checking on them to see how

20:13.420 --> 20:15.880
their wife did when they went to surgery.

20:15.880 --> 20:19.380
You could also have the business owner that literally thinks that they can text you every

20:19.380 --> 20:23.260
single day and ask you where the leads are if things are slow for one day.

20:23.260 --> 20:26.580
So you guys need to understand, you hear a lot of these older veterans that are in my

20:26.580 --> 20:30.620
program that have been here a while, and they always talk about picking the right business

20:30.620 --> 20:31.620
owner, picking the right business owner.

20:32.220 --> 20:35.540
And a lot of you guys that are brand new, you're so desperate for money, you're going

20:35.540 --> 20:39.700
to go get the first business owner that offers you money, even if they suck, and it's going

20:39.700 --> 20:41.700
to come and bite you in the butt, okay?

20:44.700 --> 20:48.740
And it's going to bite you in the butt because you're going to be dealing with that person

20:48.740 --> 20:51.540
when you could have been dealing with someone that's way less maintenance for the exact

20:51.540 --> 20:54.260
same price, okay?

20:54.260 --> 20:56.660
Also just so you guys know, you've probably seen these memes, you've probably seen these

20:56.660 --> 20:59.540
things or you might have heard of it, maybe you don't believe it, maybe you do, but I

21:00.460 --> 21:04.020
promise you guys the cheaper, the cheapest clients that you have that are paying you

21:04.020 --> 21:08.820
the least amount of money are always the hardest ones to deal with.

21:08.820 --> 21:12.380
I don't know why it is, I don't know what it is, but that is the truth.

21:12.380 --> 21:16.580
The business owners that are the hardest to deal with are the business owners that pay

21:16.580 --> 21:17.580
the least.

21:17.580 --> 21:22.460
And I don't know why that correlation is, but I think it's because that small amount

21:22.460 --> 21:24.300
of money means everything to them.

21:24.300 --> 21:27.900
And when you deal with the big companies, when you deal with the successful companies,

21:27.940 --> 21:31.700
they don't care because they're willing to test the file, okay?

21:31.700 --> 21:35.660
So just understand that not all clients are created equally and the degree of passivity

21:35.660 --> 21:40.180
your website is going to have is going to largely depend on the client that you're working

21:40.180 --> 21:41.180
with, okay?

21:41.180 --> 21:44.860
Because that client, if you set expectations from the beginning and the client's low maintenance,

21:44.860 --> 21:48.260
the client's chill, you just have to worry about ranking your website.

21:48.260 --> 21:52.860
Once you rank the website, you're going to be glued to the top for the most part.

21:52.860 --> 21:56.980
And if you have a website glued to the top and a very low maintenance client, you have

21:56.980 --> 22:04.500
a freaking, just a gold, a piece of gold sitting in your lap, okay?

22:04.500 --> 22:05.500
It's the best thing ever.

22:05.500 --> 22:08.420
You have a low maintenance client and you have a website that's ranking.

22:08.420 --> 22:09.940
It's the best business model in the world.

22:09.940 --> 22:14.460
If you have a high maintenance client, oh man, or you didn't do your due diligence properly

22:14.460 --> 22:19.100
and you're just doing SEO backlinks, blah, blah, blah, blah, guys, those become very,

22:19.100 --> 22:20.100
very, very challenging.

22:20.100 --> 22:21.100
Okay.

22:21.100 --> 22:23.700
We have a couple of questions here.

22:23.700 --> 22:26.540
Scott says, how about competition in the search results?

22:26.540 --> 22:28.860
Which lead gen in the top 10, do you try another?

22:28.860 --> 22:29.860
That's such a good question.

22:29.860 --> 22:31.500
I've answered this question a few times.

22:31.500 --> 22:34.100
No, I do not run away if that's what you're asking.

22:34.100 --> 22:36.940
If I see another lead generator in the top 10.

22:36.940 --> 22:40.500
And guys, first and foremost, if you guys are looking at competition, which you better

22:40.500 --> 22:44.540
be looking at competition, because if you don't look at who's ranking for the terms

22:44.540 --> 22:47.100
you want to rank for, you have no idea who you're going against.

22:47.100 --> 22:50.740
If you have no idea who you're going against, you don't know how well you need to prepare,

22:50.740 --> 22:52.500
how dialed in you need to be.

22:52.500 --> 22:56.340
So my first tip for you guys is if you're looking at competition, make sure that you're

22:56.340 --> 22:58.660
using five to seven keywords.

22:58.660 --> 22:59.660
Okay.

22:59.660 --> 23:01.420
Don't just go and type in.

23:01.420 --> 23:07.020
Let me see where somebody was living, hold on.

23:07.020 --> 23:08.020
Let's see.

23:08.020 --> 23:09.700
By the way, Luke just asked a question.

23:09.700 --> 23:11.260
He's about to hop out of the car.

23:11.260 --> 23:16.620
Luke, go ahead and ask that question inside the digital landlords so that we can answer

23:16.620 --> 23:20.100
it there since you're going to hop off because I got two more questions that are coming before

23:20.100 --> 23:21.100
you.

23:21.100 --> 23:22.100
Okay.

23:22.100 --> 23:23.100
So ask that.

23:23.100 --> 23:24.100
Great to have you on the stream.

23:24.100 --> 23:25.100
And looks like he's headed to work.

23:25.100 --> 23:26.100
It is what it is.

23:26.860 --> 23:27.860
Okay.

23:27.860 --> 23:28.860
I got to turn this air off again.

23:28.860 --> 23:29.860
Hold on.

23:29.860 --> 23:47.620
Dude, I got the laziest AC unit in the entire country.

23:47.620 --> 23:52.860
It's 75 degrees upstairs here in my office and it's October.

23:52.860 --> 23:57.100
Now, granted, I know it's hot outside, but my goodness, the AC just doesn't want to crank.

23:57.100 --> 23:58.940
Maybe we should use my house as a lead.

23:58.940 --> 24:00.620
Too bad that's not my favorite niche.

24:00.620 --> 24:01.620
Okay.

24:01.620 --> 24:02.620
Okay.

24:02.620 --> 24:03.620
Hold on one sec.

24:03.620 --> 24:04.780
Let's see what we got here.

24:04.780 --> 24:07.820
So going back to Scott.

24:07.820 --> 24:12.740
So what I was about to say, guys, is that you need to make sure you're using multiple keywords.

24:12.740 --> 24:18.940
Imagine if I used somebody said they were in Cleveland, Ohio, Kurt Thomas.

24:18.940 --> 24:24.220
Then I go into Cleveland and I type in tree service, Cleveland, Ohio, and I look at it

24:24.220 --> 24:27.140
and it looks super competitive, right?

24:27.140 --> 24:28.420
Because it is.

24:28.420 --> 24:32.940
And everyone there is pretty, you know, these websites are juicy websites, lots of content,

24:32.940 --> 24:35.060
old websites, older domains.

24:35.060 --> 24:38.060
You know, I've got a good backlink profile, good, well-written content.

24:38.060 --> 24:43.220
And I look at the term tree service, Cleveland, Ohio or concrete, what'd I say?

24:43.220 --> 24:44.220
Tree.

24:44.220 --> 24:45.220
I can't remember.

24:45.220 --> 24:46.220
We'll use tree service.

24:47.220 --> 24:49.820
And it looks super competitive.

24:49.820 --> 24:50.820
And I'm like, yeah, I'm out.

24:50.820 --> 24:52.300
Dude, this looks way competitive.

24:52.300 --> 24:55.980
However, what if I went in and I looked at instead of one term, I looked at seven terms

24:55.980 --> 25:03.300
and that term tree service was the most, there was very, very competitive, but tree removal,

25:03.300 --> 25:07.900
tree company, tree cutting, tree service company, tree company near me, tree service company

25:07.900 --> 25:13.700
near me, on and on, tree, tree lopping, whatever, if you're in Australia, all of those terms

25:13.700 --> 25:14.700
are wide open.

25:14.700 --> 25:18.300
There's not much competition, right?

25:18.300 --> 25:22.060
That would mean that I've missed out on a huge opportunity.

25:22.060 --> 25:25.660
On the flip side, I've done this before as I go and I look at one term, I look at foundation

25:25.660 --> 25:28.700
repair Savannah, Georgia.

25:28.700 --> 25:31.260
And dude, that term right there looks amazing.

25:31.260 --> 25:32.260
It looks like it's wide open.

25:32.260 --> 25:33.860
It looks like I can go in, I can rank it.

25:33.860 --> 25:35.980
And I'm like, dude, this is a great opportunity.

25:35.980 --> 25:37.940
The CPC on that one term is good.

25:37.940 --> 25:39.780
I go in and I decide to build a project.

25:39.780 --> 25:44.460
I decide to start running ads, but I forgot to look at the other six keywords, the other

25:45.220 --> 25:47.900
five keywords, and I don't even realize it.

25:47.900 --> 25:52.540
And I get in and I'm getting my butt handed to me because I didn't look at all the keywords.

25:52.540 --> 25:57.740
So the answer, the short answer to your question, Scott, is no, I do not care if I see another

25:57.740 --> 25:58.900
lead generator in there.

25:58.900 --> 26:04.120
All I do is I view that as another competition, as another business owner that's stealing

26:04.120 --> 26:05.120
my leads.

26:05.120 --> 26:06.620
And I got to get in there and steal them back.

26:06.620 --> 26:07.620
That's it.

26:07.620 --> 26:08.620
Okay.

26:08.620 --> 26:11.540
Whether it's a lead generator, whether it's home advisor, whether it's the local concrete

26:11.700 --> 26:14.740
tree service guy, they are stealing your spots.

26:14.740 --> 26:17.340
They are taking your leads and they are competition.

26:17.340 --> 26:21.220
But I'm not going to treat a lead generator as any different of competition than just

26:21.220 --> 26:22.580
Joe down the street.

26:22.580 --> 26:23.940
I just need to look at his website.

26:23.940 --> 26:28.660
If his website is very juicy, very highly ranked, high domain authority, high, really

26:28.660 --> 26:31.420
good backlink profile, I might not go into that.

26:31.420 --> 26:35.340
But if it's garbage, then I'm going to pretend I don't even know that's a lead generation

26:35.340 --> 26:37.660
website and I'm going to go into it anyway.

26:37.660 --> 26:38.660
Okay.

26:38.720 --> 26:39.720
Good comments.

26:42.160 --> 26:46.620
Lars Shepard says, do you have any red flags you look for when you first talk to a B.O.?

26:46.620 --> 26:47.620
Yes.

26:47.620 --> 26:50.140
Number one red flag is they're rude to their clients.

26:50.140 --> 26:51.140
Okay.

26:51.140 --> 26:53.860
This is why I like to live transfer my first few leads, guys.

26:53.860 --> 26:56.780
By the way, we're going to be talking about some of my most passive websites here in just

26:56.780 --> 26:57.780
a second.

26:57.780 --> 26:58.780
Then we're going to get into Q&A.

26:58.780 --> 27:05.620
But if I hear them talking poorly to their clients, don't have good customer service,

27:05.620 --> 27:07.580
you know what I can automatically assume

27:07.580 --> 27:09.980
is that they're not going to retain clients.

27:09.980 --> 27:11.700
And they're probably not gonna close deals.

27:11.700 --> 27:13.420
And if they don't close deals and they don't make money

27:13.420 --> 27:14.700
and they don't retain clients,

27:14.700 --> 27:16.620
they're not gonna be with me very long.

27:16.620 --> 27:17.460
They're not gonna have money.

27:17.460 --> 27:19.620
It's not gonna be an ROI.

27:19.620 --> 27:22.780
Even if my leads are good, there's gonna be no ROI

27:22.780 --> 27:24.660
and I'm going to lose that client.

27:24.660 --> 27:26.820
So if I hear you talking to a client poorly,

27:26.820 --> 27:29.420
if I hear you being rude or short

27:29.420 --> 27:32.460
or non-personal with a client,

27:32.460 --> 27:33.780
I already can tell you

27:33.940 --> 27:35.660
that even though they're willing to give me money,

27:35.660 --> 27:37.140
I'm not gonna take it.

27:37.140 --> 27:38.580
Because I'm looking to build relationships

27:38.580 --> 27:39.820
with business owners that want to be with me

27:39.820 --> 27:42.860
for 10, 15, 20 years and make millions of dollars together.

27:42.860 --> 27:44.900
I'm not looking to get a client today,

27:44.900 --> 27:47.900
three months later, switch it out for somebody else.

27:47.900 --> 27:49.980
So if I hear them talking poorly,

27:49.980 --> 27:51.540
that's a huge red flag for me.

27:53.780 --> 27:55.860
Let's see, I'm in the car on the way to work

27:55.860 --> 27:57.340
so I need to balance my interest to know

27:57.340 --> 27:59.260
once you have finally ranked organically,

27:59.260 --> 28:00.540
are you still drip feeding the sites

28:00.540 --> 28:02.140
with backlinks to content or is it okay?

28:02.140 --> 28:05.180
So he's asking guys, once you rank the site organically,

28:05.180 --> 28:08.020
do you keep dripping on backlinks, keep adding content?

28:08.020 --> 28:09.900
And the answer is you can.

28:10.780 --> 28:12.940
What I've done is I've done such strong due diligence

28:12.940 --> 28:15.860
on most of my websites that I do not even worry about it.

28:15.860 --> 28:17.180
I don't even log into my website.

28:17.180 --> 28:18.940
It's kind of like, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.

28:18.940 --> 28:21.220
We have websites, we don't even,

28:21.220 --> 28:22.380
I mean, we could find the password,

28:22.380 --> 28:23.380
but we don't know the password.

28:23.380 --> 28:25.180
It's not even part of our regular account.

28:25.180 --> 28:27.380
We've got Towing St. George, my last towing project.

28:27.380 --> 28:28.460
I'm never gonna do it again.

28:28.460 --> 28:29.460
We don't touch it.

28:29.460 --> 28:30.740
We've got Bentonville Concrete.

28:30.740 --> 28:32.020
No way I'm touching that.

28:32.900 --> 28:34.380
We've got a handful, 10, 15 sites

28:34.380 --> 28:36.060
that are ranking super well,

28:36.060 --> 28:38.860
and there's absolutely no reason for us to go in

28:38.860 --> 28:40.780
and mess with it because we're already ranking.

28:40.780 --> 28:43.260
So that's the approach that I've chosen to take,

28:43.260 --> 28:44.460
but it's up to you guys.

28:46.300 --> 28:47.140
Okay?

28:48.540 --> 28:50.060
Kurt says good stuff.

28:50.060 --> 28:51.460
So guys, here's what I'm gonna do.

28:55.060 --> 28:56.660
Let me see if I can pull up a couple of websites.

28:57.940 --> 28:59.300
Let me see if I can pull up a couple of websites

28:59.300 --> 29:00.140
for you guys.

29:02.780 --> 29:05.980
Here, show you some of my most passive websites.

29:07.980 --> 29:09.700
And we're gonna do, which ones did I wanna do?

29:09.700 --> 29:11.020
We got that one.

29:13.420 --> 29:14.260
All right.

29:17.140 --> 29:18.380
One more, one more.

29:18.380 --> 29:20.420
Let's see which last one we're gonna do.

29:20.420 --> 29:21.260
There it is.

29:24.340 --> 29:26.540
I'm gonna show you guys my screen here, by the way.

29:26.540 --> 29:28.900
Let me get rid of about 100 things here.

29:28.940 --> 29:33.940
All my Slack messages, all my rain music from nighttime.

29:34.020 --> 29:35.340
Do not connect the phone.

29:35.340 --> 29:36.980
Thank you.

29:36.980 --> 29:39.460
All right, guys, here we go.

29:39.460 --> 29:42.740
Let me show you a couple of my most passive websites

29:42.740 --> 29:44.820
on the interwebs today,

29:44.820 --> 29:47.380
and I should tell you guys exactly how passive they are.

29:47.380 --> 29:48.900
Okay, share my screen.

29:48.900 --> 29:50.620
Boom, boom, boom.

29:52.620 --> 29:55.220
Okay, I don't know if you guys can actually see this,

29:55.220 --> 29:57.900
but I'm gonna start off with Bentonville Concrete.

29:57.900 --> 30:00.420
If you guys have heard me talk about this,

30:00.420 --> 30:01.340
kick it out of my face.

30:01.340 --> 30:03.540
So this is us right here, Bentonville Concrete.

30:03.540 --> 30:04.660
We're in the maps.

30:04.660 --> 30:05.980
This is also us, rank number one.

30:05.980 --> 30:10.980
You can also type in Concrete Contractor Bentonville AR.

30:18.060 --> 30:20.500
Rank number two here, rank number one here, okay?

30:20.500 --> 30:21.860
This is my website.

30:21.860 --> 30:24.620
Guys, I'm going to let you know,

30:24.620 --> 30:27.380
the last time I messaged this person

30:27.380 --> 30:30.700
was on about business,

30:30.700 --> 30:32.340
because once in a while we'll talk about random stuff.

30:32.340 --> 30:34.500
Like he just randomly sent me something a couple weeks ago

30:34.500 --> 30:36.580
about some completely random thing.

30:36.580 --> 30:38.980
But the last time he asked about business, guys,

30:40.660 --> 30:45.660
was on November 10th,

30:46.900 --> 30:48.540
Friday, November 10th of last year.

30:48.540 --> 30:49.380
He said, hey brother,

30:49.380 --> 30:50.780
I've sent a bunch of emails back and forth.

30:50.780 --> 30:52.580
I'd like to get together and talk and figure out

30:52.580 --> 30:54.460
how I can really expand this business.

30:55.300 --> 30:56.140
I know you guys are good at what you do.

30:56.140 --> 30:58.620
And so are we, I want your help.

30:58.620 --> 31:00.220
Let's figure out how we can do this together.

31:00.220 --> 31:01.980
So the only reason this guy even texts me

31:01.980 --> 31:03.980
is because he was asking me for more business, okay?

31:03.980 --> 31:05.620
This is one of my most passive websites.

31:05.620 --> 31:06.540
It's glued to the top.

31:06.540 --> 31:08.300
We haven't logged into this thing in years.

31:08.300 --> 31:09.540
Haven't changed it in years.

31:09.540 --> 31:11.620
I haven't talked to my business owner since November.

31:11.620 --> 31:12.460
There you have it.

31:12.460 --> 31:14.220
And even then I never even got on a call with him, not yet.

31:14.220 --> 31:15.060
Okay, that's my first one.

31:15.060 --> 31:17.420
My second one is one called St. George Epoxy.

31:17.420 --> 31:20.220
If you type in St. George Epoxy, Epoxy St. George,

31:20.220 --> 31:22.380
it's all called stgeorgeepoxy.com.

31:22.380 --> 31:23.740
Check out this beaut.

31:23.740 --> 31:26.220
This guy right here is an absolute,

31:26.220 --> 31:29.720
just pile of you know what, super basic whatever,

31:29.720 --> 31:30.820
but it works.

31:30.820 --> 31:33.900
And I'm gonna look up the business owner

31:33.900 --> 31:37.420
so I can show you guys, or tell you guys at least.

31:37.420 --> 31:38.980
The last time I got a text from him,

31:38.980 --> 31:41.140
I have three unread messages from him.

31:41.140 --> 31:43.860
March 15th, two messages on March 15th,

31:43.860 --> 31:45.220
and a message on March 16th.

31:45.220 --> 31:46.420
The last thing he said is,

31:46.420 --> 31:50.420
we still need to do your pool deck, LOL, okay?

31:50.420 --> 31:52.980
Homie's still trying to scrape my business, no problem.

31:52.980 --> 31:54.340
Come and give me a quote on it.

31:54.340 --> 31:55.620
I don't really mind, okay?

31:55.620 --> 31:56.880
This website right here,

31:56.880 --> 31:58.660
we also have not logged into in years.

31:58.660 --> 31:59.700
We talked to the business owner.

31:59.700 --> 32:01.420
What did I say the date was?

32:01.420 --> 32:02.580
July, it's been over a year.

32:02.580 --> 32:04.460
That's 2023, it's been a year.

32:04.460 --> 32:06.940
July, August, September, been a year and two months.

32:06.940 --> 32:08.540
Haven't talked to the client, okay?

32:08.540 --> 32:10.660
Let's give you guys one more.

32:10.660 --> 32:12.460
We'll do St. George Concrete, type this in.

32:12.460 --> 32:14.260
You're gonna see us, we are running ads.

32:14.260 --> 32:16.040
She's sponsored here, us.

32:17.380 --> 32:19.460
We're ranked number one underneath the map,

32:19.460 --> 32:21.600
or sorry, the paid.

32:21.600 --> 32:22.620
This is it.

32:23.300 --> 32:24.140
Okay?

32:25.200 --> 32:27.180
I'm sorry, this is, okay, here's a perfect example.

32:27.180 --> 32:28.700
This is not my website.

32:28.700 --> 32:29.540
I'm lying to you.

32:29.540 --> 32:30.940
I think it was Scott who was asking.

32:30.940 --> 32:33.140
So look at this, guys, okay?

32:33.140 --> 32:34.740
We got, this should give you guys

32:34.740 --> 32:36.060
so much freaking excitement.

32:36.060 --> 32:38.000
So we got ConcreteStGeorge.com,

32:38.000 --> 32:40.180
which has been there for a long time, okay?

32:40.180 --> 32:41.380
They're actually outranking me.

32:41.380 --> 32:44.220
I'm StGeorgeConcreteCO.com, okay?

32:44.220 --> 32:47.020
That site looked a little too nice for it to be mine, okay?

32:47.020 --> 32:50.240
This is my site in all of its glory, it's a beaut.

32:50.240 --> 32:53.600
And this website makes me $375 per week.

32:53.600 --> 32:56.060
This client, let me just go ahead and check.

32:58.360 --> 32:59.900
What the hell is his name?

33:00.800 --> 33:03.580
Oh, this is gonna be a problem.

33:05.840 --> 33:07.840
Is it, shit.

33:11.200 --> 33:14.120
What is his, ah, yes, I just remembered it.

33:14.120 --> 33:15.100
That's what it is.

33:15.440 --> 33:18.440
Yep, okay, November 18th, 2022.

33:21.740 --> 33:25.740
I got one text from November 18th, 2022.

33:25.740 --> 33:27.980
These guys have spent with me.

33:30.780 --> 33:31.620
Let me look.

33:37.060 --> 33:38.060
What the hell?

33:40.580 --> 33:43.100
Okay, not that, not that, not that, not that.

33:43.660 --> 33:46.060
Okay, not that, not that, not that, right there.

33:46.060 --> 33:47.420
Ah, no, that's, is that it?

33:49.740 --> 33:51.780
No, that's not it, dude.

34:00.940 --> 34:02.940
Okay, oh, right there, there it is.

34:02.940 --> 34:05.940
Okay, this client pays me $375 a week,

34:05.940 --> 34:08.620
has paid me, to date,

34:09.460 --> 34:13.380
five, five, oh, sorry, $57,000 on the nose.

34:13.380 --> 34:16.460
Okay, been with me since November 3rd, 2021,

34:16.460 --> 34:17.460
the website you're looking at.

34:17.460 --> 34:19.900
Not ranked number one, not ranking in the maps,

34:19.900 --> 34:21.380
don't even think I have a maps listing.

34:21.380 --> 34:24.860
This thing is churning out leads, $375 a week.

34:24.860 --> 34:26.460
Unfrickin' believable.

34:26.460 --> 34:29.100
This is some of my most passive websites,

34:29.100 --> 34:32.740
and I just grabbed those ones for fun, okay?

34:32.740 --> 34:34.540
Just to give you guys a bit of an idea,

34:34.540 --> 34:37.300
and guys, here's why I think this model is so passive.

34:38.900 --> 34:40.420
I think this model's really passive

34:40.420 --> 34:42.340
because it's such a binary transaction.

34:42.340 --> 34:43.860
I give you leads, you give me money.

34:43.860 --> 34:45.620
You give me money, I give you leads.

34:45.620 --> 34:47.340
If you stop giving me leads, I stop giving you money.

34:47.340 --> 34:48.980
If I stop giving you money, you stop giving me leads.

34:48.980 --> 34:50.260
Done, done, done.

34:50.260 --> 34:51.900
There's no reporting, there's no this,

34:51.900 --> 34:54.260
can you do this stuff, yes?

34:54.260 --> 34:55.700
Do you have to, no.

34:55.700 --> 34:56.940
Okay, no other business model I know

34:56.940 --> 34:58.660
that's such a cut and dry transaction

34:58.660 --> 35:00.220
that's you do this, and I do this,

35:00.220 --> 35:02.340
or else we're done because the arrangement,

35:02.340 --> 35:04.060
there's no room for fluff, right?

35:04.060 --> 35:05.380
When you're doing SEO,

35:05.380 --> 35:07.780
you could do almost nothing for the client.

35:07.780 --> 35:09.060
It took you no time.

35:09.060 --> 35:11.060
Or you could go hire somebody in the Philippines

35:11.060 --> 35:12.660
to do backlinks, do 100 backlinks,

35:12.660 --> 35:13.820
and you come to the business owner and go,

35:13.820 --> 35:16.380
dude, look, I did 100 backlinks for your website,

35:16.380 --> 35:17.540
and by the way, blah, blah, blah,

35:17.540 --> 35:18.860
it doesn't even make sense,

35:18.860 --> 35:20.820
but you're able to show them and craft it

35:20.820 --> 35:23.620
to make it look like you want it to look.

35:23.620 --> 35:26.740
The downside is, with this business model,

35:26.740 --> 35:28.940
you can't fake it, man, and I think that's an upside,

35:28.940 --> 35:29.780
but you can't fake it.

35:29.780 --> 35:30.900
You can't fake work you didn't do

35:30.900 --> 35:31.900
because if leads don't come in,

35:31.900 --> 35:34.060
leads don't come in and they're paying for leads.

35:34.060 --> 35:36.060
That's why I think this business model is so passive.

35:36.060 --> 35:37.340
It's very cut and dry.

35:37.340 --> 35:39.340
It's leads for dollars, okay?

35:39.340 --> 35:42.020
And then lastly, guys, I just wanna let you guys know

35:42.020 --> 35:44.740
that just because you don't have to talk to your clients,

35:44.740 --> 35:47.220
just because you don't have to call them every five minutes,

35:47.220 --> 35:49.180
because you don't have to send them a report,

35:49.180 --> 35:51.860
I want you to picture a business that you have

35:51.860 --> 35:53.380
that you actually do that,

35:53.380 --> 35:56.340
that you actually treat them like they're your last client.

35:56.340 --> 35:59.220
You treat them like they're all of their money

35:59.220 --> 36:00.740
pays all of your bills and then some

36:00.740 --> 36:01.940
because they're that big of a client

36:01.940 --> 36:03.340
and they're all you have to worry about.

36:03.340 --> 36:04.820
Imagine what your business would be like.

36:04.820 --> 36:06.140
Imagine how excited they would be.

36:06.140 --> 36:07.500
Imagine how they would grow with you.

36:07.500 --> 36:09.620
Imagine how many people they would refer you to.

36:09.620 --> 36:10.900
If you just made the decision,

36:10.900 --> 36:14.100
hey, I'm not required to really follow up with this person

36:14.100 --> 36:15.460
or treat them a certain way,

36:15.460 --> 36:17.940
but I'm gonna do it because that's how I do business.

36:17.940 --> 36:19.260
Imagine how many referrals you'd have

36:19.260 --> 36:23.780
be coming down the freaking pipe, a lot, okay?

36:23.780 --> 36:24.620
A lot.

36:24.620 --> 36:27.780
Guys, this model is one of if not the most passive models

36:27.780 --> 36:29.740
on the internet, no questions asked.

36:29.740 --> 36:32.980
And this is the reason I'm able to travel to Dubai

36:33.740 --> 36:35.300
for a month at a time, two times.

36:35.300 --> 36:36.660
We've been in Africa for three months,

36:36.660 --> 36:38.220
been to London twice,

36:38.220 --> 36:40.020
been to a couple of different places in the US,

36:40.020 --> 36:43.260
including Tuscaloosa, Georgia, Alabama game,

36:43.260 --> 36:46.100
getting ready to potentially go to Arkansas

36:46.100 --> 36:47.460
in a week and a half.

36:47.460 --> 36:50.140
Or if not, I might go back to Africa

36:50.140 --> 36:51.500
during that same time.

36:51.500 --> 36:53.780
All of this is possible because this model is passive

36:53.780 --> 36:54.780
and there's different levels.

36:54.780 --> 36:57.460
Okay, just because you have an online business, that's great.

36:57.460 --> 36:59.300
But if that online business is not passive,

36:59.300 --> 37:00.540
you could travel anywhere you want,

37:00.540 --> 37:01.700
but you're gonna be stuck at the hotel

37:01.700 --> 37:03.660
making sure that business is as usual

37:03.660 --> 37:06.660
or you can't keep living that way.

37:06.660 --> 37:09.140
With this, you can do it, you front load all the work

37:09.140 --> 37:11.540
and then you set it and you forget it, okay?

37:11.540 --> 37:13.900
So guys, that is what I truly believe.

37:13.900 --> 37:15.500
This is how passive these things are.

37:15.500 --> 37:17.420
I will tell you that that website I showed you,

37:17.420 --> 37:20.260
Bentonville Concrete, I don't think we're running any ads.

37:20.260 --> 37:25.260
We have a 20 something dollar a year GoDaddy bill.

37:25.500 --> 37:29.860
Cool, we're paying for a tracking number five bucks

37:29.860 --> 37:34.860
and the domain, sorry, the hosting and the domain.

37:35.020 --> 37:37.300
I think that the domain is the thing that's 24 bucks

37:37.300 --> 37:39.540
and then we have the hosting that's like 13 bucks a month.

37:39.540 --> 37:43.180
So guys, all in on less than $50 per month on a website

37:43.180 --> 37:45.340
that's making me about 900 bucks a month.

37:45.340 --> 37:47.160
That's the case for all of these websites.

37:47.160 --> 37:50.860
That's how low cost these things can actually be, okay?

37:50.860 --> 37:52.800
So that said guys, let's see if we have any questions.

37:52.800 --> 37:54.260
If we do, great.

37:54.260 --> 37:59.020
If we don't, then we will go back to making money.

37:59.060 --> 38:01.540
Let me just pull this up really quick.

38:01.540 --> 38:04.660
Give me a sec, where you at?

38:04.660 --> 38:08.060
Dog, oh, he's just hiding from me.

38:08.060 --> 38:08.900
Okay.

38:11.220 --> 38:13.260
Ah, where is this at?

38:13.260 --> 38:14.080
And by the way guys,

38:14.080 --> 38:15.300
I really appreciate you guys being on the call.

38:15.300 --> 38:17.060
I know you guys got a lot of places you can be.

38:17.060 --> 38:18.940
I know there's a lot of things you could be doing.

38:18.940 --> 38:20.260
There's a lot of places you could spend your time

38:20.260 --> 38:22.760
and I appreciate you doing it here inside of this group.

38:22.760 --> 38:23.600
I really do.

38:23.600 --> 38:26.900
Okay, so let's see what else we've got going on.

38:30.020 --> 38:33.980
Oh, all right, let's go like this.

38:36.140 --> 38:38.580
How important is it to occupy more real estate

38:38.580 --> 38:40.140
multiple websites on the first page

38:40.140 --> 38:41.940
for our keywords to hold a monopoly?

38:45.520 --> 38:46.420
I don't have any websites

38:46.420 --> 38:48.740
that have more than one piece of real estate.

38:50.420 --> 38:52.700
I've had websites in the past that I ranked the homepage,

38:52.700 --> 38:54.660
I ranked the service page, we had like two,

38:54.660 --> 38:56.180
plus we had the maps.

38:56.180 --> 38:58.780
But guys, most of my deals

38:58.780 --> 39:01.300
are ranking a website organically.

39:01.300 --> 39:04.360
I don't mess with GMB at all really anymore.

39:04.360 --> 39:05.660
I have some paid ads coming in,

39:05.660 --> 39:06.860
I got some organic coming in,

39:06.860 --> 39:08.940
I keep the client happy with that.

39:08.940 --> 39:09.780
Okay.

39:10.820 --> 39:13.140
Kirk says, how important is GMB and how do you acquire it?

39:13.140 --> 39:15.580
No, it's not, I don't do it anymore.

39:15.580 --> 39:18.620
Guys, in 2020, when I scaled up to $100,000

39:18.620 --> 39:19.940
a month in eight months,

39:19.940 --> 39:22.060
half of my websites didn't even have GMB.

39:22.060 --> 39:23.660
We think that they have to have GMB

39:23.660 --> 39:25.780
because we think somehow the clients know about GMB.

39:25.780 --> 39:27.060
The clients don't know shit, dude.

39:27.060 --> 39:29.540
I'm sorry for the language, but they don't know anything.

39:29.540 --> 39:32.220
So don't think that just because you don't have a GMB,

39:32.220 --> 39:34.180
you're not gonna be able to charge $1,500 a month.

39:34.180 --> 39:36.860
Okay, that concrete website I showed you guys,

39:36.860 --> 39:39.680
let me see if I can even try to find, hold on.

39:42.180 --> 39:44.580
Let me see if I can share the screen really quick.

39:46.180 --> 39:48.180
All right, let's see if we can even find,

39:48.180 --> 39:50.300
I don't even think we have a map listing, dude.

39:50.300 --> 39:52.020
This is $1,500 a month deal

39:52.020 --> 39:54.700
that's paid me over $57,000 so far.

39:54.700 --> 39:55.780
And I'm telling you right now,

39:55.780 --> 40:00.460
we do not have a St. George concrete site.

40:00.460 --> 40:02.100
I think we did, I think it got pulled.

40:02.100 --> 40:02.980
So to answer your question,

40:02.980 --> 40:04.920
I don't worry about it at all, okay?

40:06.780 --> 40:08.660
Laura says, do you feel like Flat Fever's commission

40:08.660 --> 40:09.700
is really important to make this pass?

40:09.700 --> 40:10.540
Yes.

40:11.860 --> 40:13.060
No questions asked.

40:13.060 --> 40:15.780
I can't even imagine doing passive income for one deal,

40:15.780 --> 40:17.220
or sorry, passive.

40:17.220 --> 40:19.220
Commission deals for one deal,

40:19.220 --> 40:20.420
much less a bunch of deals.

40:20.420 --> 40:21.380
That sounds like a nightmare.

40:21.380 --> 40:23.100
That sounds like I'd rather pull out my teeth,

40:23.100 --> 40:24.420
pull out my toenails,

40:25.060 --> 40:25.900
do something like that,

40:25.900 --> 40:26.740
rather than put a rat on top of my head

40:26.740 --> 40:29.580
with a woven basket and let it eat down in my skull,

40:29.580 --> 40:30.660
than doing commission, guys.

40:30.660 --> 40:32.580
Commission does not scale.

40:32.580 --> 40:33.660
They have nothing in the game.

40:33.660 --> 40:34.900
They have no reason to go to these leads.

40:34.900 --> 40:36.940
They have no reason to be better than average.

40:36.940 --> 40:40.420
And most of these guys are very, very average or less, okay?

40:40.420 --> 40:42.340
You have to do flat fee if you want to scale.

40:42.340 --> 40:43.180
If you don't want to scale,

40:43.180 --> 40:45.100
you just want a couple bucks coming in here and there.

40:45.100 --> 40:47.260
You can go to everybody to say yes to a commission deal,

40:47.260 --> 40:50.420
but just know upfront that commission deals don't work.

40:50.420 --> 40:51.340
They don't work long-term.

40:51.340 --> 40:54.780
They don't scale and it is very, very cumbersome.

40:54.780 --> 40:56.140
So that said, if you don't want to believe me,

40:56.140 --> 40:56.980
then go try it.

40:58.580 --> 40:59.780
Kurt says, RIP GMB.

40:59.780 --> 41:03.060
Yeah, RIP GMB, RIP GMB, but you know what?

41:03.060 --> 41:03.900
It is what it is, man.

41:03.900 --> 41:05.340
We're going to move on to the next thing.

41:05.340 --> 41:07.260
That's what we're going to do.

41:07.260 --> 41:09.300
Okay, guys, I appreciate you jumping on this call.

41:09.300 --> 41:10.420
I'm excited to be back.

41:10.420 --> 41:11.860
I think next week we're going to resume

41:11.860 --> 41:14.220
doing the calls Monday at 6.30 a.m.

41:14.220 --> 41:16.740
So we'll keep an eye out for that post.
