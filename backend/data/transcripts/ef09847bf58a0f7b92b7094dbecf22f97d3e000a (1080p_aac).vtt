00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
You're going to answer the calls, the leads, as they come in, you're going to answer them live if you can.

00:05.000 --> 00:09.000
Now, if you're somebody that has a day job or you missed the call, it's okay.

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
You're going to call the leads back, okay?

00:12.000 --> 00:17.000
And when you call these leads, you aren't going to act like a lead generation company.

00:17.000 --> 00:21.000
You're not going to, hey, my name is Nick with Evergreen and we're going to patch you in.

00:21.000 --> 00:22.000
No, no, no.

00:22.000 --> 00:29.000
You are just going to act like you work for a tree company or a concrete company or whatever.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
You're going to keep it vague, okay?

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
You're going to call these business owners, or sorry, these leads, and you're going to call them up.

00:35.000 --> 00:39.000
Say, hey, Janet, this is Nick with Las Vegas Tree Service.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
Saw that you called.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
What do you got going on?

00:41.000 --> 00:42.000
How can I help?

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
Well, I was looking to get my palm tree removed.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
Okay, cool.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
How big is it?

00:47.000 --> 00:48.000
Blah, blah, blah.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
I'm acting like I know what I'm doing.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
Okay.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
What's your address?

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
Give me your email.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
Okay.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
And then you're going to go like this.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
Janet, thanks for calling in.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
I'm going to call the business owner to give you a call here in just a moment.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Let me get a hold of him.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
I know he's on another job and I'll get right back in touch with you.

01:02.000 --> 01:06.000
By the way, I'm probably going to be calling you from my cell phone, like the one I just called you from.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
If you see XYZ area code, it's not a scam.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
It's me.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
It's just my cell phone.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
I'm going to be on the move.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
So watch that.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
Okay, cool.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
Thanks, Janet.

01:15.000 --> 01:20.000
Now we go and we call the business owner and we do our cold call and we hook them.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
We get them on the hook.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
And I'm going to get into that whole script.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
I'm going to call them.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
We're going to say, here's the deal, Mr.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
Business owner.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
I'm going to give you three, four, five, whatever.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
I'm going to give you a couple of free leads.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
Okay.

01:31.000 --> 01:37.000
And I know you want them because you're already paying for home advisor or you're already paying for Google ads.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
So you're either allergic to money or you're looking to grow.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
So I'm going to give you these free.

01:42.000 --> 01:49.000
All I ask in exchange is we have a conversation in a couple of days about potentially, potentially working together.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
Doesn't mean we're going to, but just let me earn that call.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
With that, boom, that's it.
