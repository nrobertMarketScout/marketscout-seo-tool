00:00.000 --> 00:03.760
Can you go over why not PPL one more time in the fight?

00:03.760 --> 00:05.520
Yeah, okay, so Josh, he's asking,

00:05.520 --> 00:07.840
how do you get rid of the PPL objective?

00:07.840 --> 00:09.200
So what I do during the screencast

00:09.200 --> 00:11.360
and also during the close is I say,

00:11.360 --> 00:13.280
all right, so as far as the deal goes,

00:13.280 --> 00:14.880
we don't do commission, just so you know,

00:14.880 --> 00:16.000
the reason why is there's literally

00:16.000 --> 00:17.040
no skin in the game for you.

00:17.040 --> 00:18.000
It doesn't work out.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.440
Nope, like you're not gonna have any incentive

00:19.440 --> 00:20.320
to follow up with leads.

00:20.320 --> 00:21.280
I don't wanna track it.

00:21.280 --> 00:22.080
You don't wanna track it.

00:22.080 --> 00:22.640
It's a waste of time.

00:22.640 --> 00:23.920
I don't do that, okay?

00:23.920 --> 00:25.040
And I'll say, and I always say that,

00:25.040 --> 00:27.040
say what we used to do when we first started

00:27.040 --> 00:29.200
is we watched Home Advisor and we thought,

00:29.440 --> 00:31.680
now maybe we'll try the paper lead model.

00:31.680 --> 00:34.320
And we did it because we thought it would be really easy

00:34.320 --> 00:35.520
to sign business owners up

00:35.520 --> 00:37.280
because they only pay for what they get.

00:37.280 --> 00:39.360
But what happens, and this happens every single time,

00:39.360 --> 00:41.600
Mr. Business Owner, and without fail, okay?

00:41.600 --> 00:43.360
And this is why we do not do this anymore.

00:43.360 --> 00:46.480
We haven't done it for years is there is a threshold.

00:46.480 --> 00:48.560
So let's say that I'm sending you 10 leads

00:48.560 --> 00:50.160
at a hundred bucks a piece just for easy math, okay?

00:50.160 --> 00:52.080
And by the way, when you say that example,

00:52.080 --> 00:55.680
use a high number so that they're already like condition

00:55.680 --> 00:56.240
that it's high.

00:56.240 --> 00:58.720
So let's say that I'm sending you 20 leads

00:58.720 --> 01:00.080
at a hundred bucks a piece.

01:00.080 --> 01:01.920
You're cool paying me two grand, okay?

01:01.920 --> 01:05.280
Two grand within your budget, 2000, 2000, 2000.

01:05.280 --> 01:07.440
But what happens when, Mr. Business Owner,

01:07.440 --> 01:10.000
all of a sudden I go from 20 leads to 50?

01:10.000 --> 01:10.720
You know what's gonna happen?

01:10.720 --> 01:11.920
I'll tell you what's gonna happen.

01:11.920 --> 01:13.680
You're gonna start complaining about leads

01:13.680 --> 01:17.280
because you don't have the manpower to run 50 leads, okay?

01:17.280 --> 01:18.640
So now you're gonna start not wanting

01:18.640 --> 01:19.520
to go to certain zip codes.

01:19.520 --> 01:21.040
You're not gonna wanna take certain jobs.

01:21.040 --> 01:24.320
You're gonna wanna hire and raise your minimum price.

01:24.400 --> 01:27.280
And all of a sudden, I'm not gonna make any more money

01:27.280 --> 01:28.640
and you're gonna be complaining about it.

01:28.640 --> 01:29.840
And we're gonna literally have this back

01:29.840 --> 01:32.400
and forth every single month.

01:32.400 --> 01:34.320
And you're gonna take out your red pencil

01:34.320 --> 01:35.360
and I'm gonna take out mine.

01:36.560 --> 01:37.680
It's a absolute headache.

01:37.680 --> 01:39.440
So we do not do that anymore, period.

01:39.440 --> 01:42.800
What we found is a lot better is we just do a flat rate.

01:42.800 --> 01:44.960
And what happens is every single month,

01:44.960 --> 01:45.760
it's the exact same.

01:45.760 --> 01:47.520
We usually charge per week, by the way.

01:47.520 --> 01:49.280
In December, this is a great place to introduce this,

01:49.280 --> 01:51.200
by the way, in December, just so you know,

01:51.200 --> 01:53.360
it is gonna be a little bit slower because it's December.

01:53.440 --> 01:55.680
But the cool part is, is in the spring and the summer

01:55.680 --> 01:58.400
and the fall, when it's higher than normal,

01:58.400 --> 02:00.000
you don't get a knock on your door like,

02:00.000 --> 02:01.440
hey, let's raise the price.

02:01.440 --> 02:02.480
So that's why we do the flat fee.

02:02.480 --> 02:04.160
So let me show you how we came up with your flat fee,

02:04.160 --> 02:05.040
Mr. Business Hunter.

02:05.040 --> 02:07.520
Here's what I call the lead value calculator.

02:07.520 --> 02:09.040
Whatiseleadworth.com.

02:09.040 --> 02:10.960
There you go, Mr. Josh Savage.

02:10.960 --> 02:11.280
Boom.
