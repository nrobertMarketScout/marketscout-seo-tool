1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,240
Guys, I'm going to ask you to become private investigators at this stage of the list building

2
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,240
process.

3
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:21,560
So what we're going to do here is now that we've built a list of multiple business owners

4
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:26,400
paying for Google Ads, Home Advisor, Angie's list, Angie's leads, whatever it's called,

5
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,520
and on and on and on.

6
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:32,000
Now what we want to do is we want to go and find specific pieces of information about

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,680
this business owner so that when the leads come in and we go to make the call, when we

8
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,880
go to make the hook, we have specific information about this individual that's going to give

9
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,560
us, and it's going to increase our chances of getting the deal.

10
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:50,600
Biggest piece of information that we need is we want the business owner's full name

11
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,960
and cell phone if possible.

12
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,520
Because there's a huge difference when you call in, and let's say you hit a secretary,

13
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,280
or let's say you call them specifically and you call in and you say, Hey, is this the

14
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,320
business owner?

15
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,520
When you call and say, Hey, is this the business owner?

16
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,520
Sounds sketchy.

17
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,520
It sounds scammy.

18
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,520
It sounds salesy.

19
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,520
Okay.

20
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,560
But if you call and you say, Hey, is this Mike?

21
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,640
Sounds way different, right?

22
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,880
You call the secretary and say, Hey, can you pass me over to Mike?

23
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,440
This is Nick.

24
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,960
Sounds way different than, Hey, is the business owner in?

25
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:18,960
Right?

26
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,960
Totally different.

27
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:24,400
So what we're going to do in this module, or sorry, this lesson, not module, this specific

28
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:29,040
lesson is we're going to find specific pieces of information about this business owner.

29
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,200
And some of you guys are going to go, man, this is a lot like to look up.

30
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,200
Yes, it is.

31
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,200
But no one else is willing to do this stuff.

32
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,200
And that's why we're doing it.

33
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,200
So I'm going to have you jump over to the screen with me.

34
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,200
Okay, guys, here is what we're going to do.

35
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,200
I'm going to show you.

36
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,640
And again, as we've talked about this specific city, there wasn't a lot of people paying

37
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,640
for Google ads.

38
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,800
And I just want to show you how we find this information.

39
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,960
So I didn't build out the full list.

40
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,960
I'm still going to go for it simply because it's such low hanging fruit and the position

41
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,960
I'm in.

42
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,960
So it's totally fine.

43
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,440
But I want to show you with this McDowell landscaping old Mike, how we're going to find

44
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,440
information.

45
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,920
Now, the only reason I know it's Mike, going back to the previous videos, because his voicemail

46
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,000
said it was Mike, if it didn't, what we'd have to do is start getting creative.

47
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,480
And so one thing I want the first thing is, as far as finding the business owner's name,

48
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,320
because I think that is super important.

49
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,520
And that's a good starting point is finding their name is I like to check the website,

50
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,520
obviously.

51
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,520
Okay, so go to the website.

52
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,080
I like to check the about page.

53
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,280
And if that that's usually an easy place to find it.

54
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:33,600
So kind of scan here, that that that that I don't see anything, Mike, I'm going to search.

55
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,360
Yeah, I don't see.

56
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,940
Okay, that's funny.

57
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:39,400
So I don't see anything on the about section.

58
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:45,680
But because I knew what the name was, I control after it, which is, you know, you could search

59
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,680
the thing.

60
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,180
And one of the reviews said, you know, Mike right here.

61
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,220
So you can look at their reviews on the website.

62
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:55,540
But that was the next thing that I was going to say is I like to go to their Google reviews.

63
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:59,040
And you can really easily read inside the Google reviews.

64
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,420
And people like to act like they know the business owner.

65
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:04,180
They love acting important, and whatever.

66
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:07,460
So they'll always say, we hired Mike to expand our patio.

67
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:11,860
So maybe it's Mike, maybe that's the crew member, I don't know, okay, Mike and the McDowell

68
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:12,860
landscaping team.

69
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,860
Oh, okay.

70
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,340
So his name is Mike, Mike and his crew.

71
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:23,680
So we can pretty quickly see that his name is Mike, okay, so Mike McDowell, really simple.

72
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,860
That's how I usually find the business owner name.

73
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,960
Next thing I like to do is I like to find their Facebook page.

74
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,840
So right here, this one was easy.

75
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,920
It just popped up.

76
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,300
So McDowell landscaping, you can tell it's the same, make sure they're in it's the right

77
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,100
city and everything matches up.

78
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:45,780
So click on this, and I'm just going to drop it over here into the Facebook page.

79
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,260
Okay.

80
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,260
What else?

81
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:55,640
Facebook, let's see, email, let's grab the email, I didn't see it on the site, nope,

82
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,100
but usually it is on the Facebook page.

83
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:02,980
So go to the about section, I think, on here, or it's just under the home, yeah, home, look

84
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:03,980
at that.

85
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:08,920
And it also says in his email, Mike M, like he's just given it to us, super easy.

86
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,600
This one's very simple.

87
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,760
We've definitely had some other ones that have been more difficult, which I'll go over

88
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,800
here in a moment.

89
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:22,160
Current position, you can honestly skip that, I might even take that out.

90
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,920
That's kind of where they're ranking, but they weren't ranking, so I don't need that.

91
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,440
Only other thing I would like to add is the business owner Facebook profile.

92
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:35,040
I think it's very interesting to find their profile, their Facebook profile, and just

93
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,060
learn one or two things about them.

94
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:40,140
You can learn a lot about someone based on their Facebook profile.

95
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:42,060
So how do we find the Facebook profile?

96
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,260
Well, first thing you're gonna do is you could just simply search it, okay, so you could

97
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:58,060
go Mike McDowell, okay, and that's got a lot of options, so I would type in the term landscaping

98
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:08,780
as well and see if that pulls it up, okay.

99
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:09,780
Nothing here.

100
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:13,920
Okay, I'm actually glad this is doing this so I can show you how to find this, okay.

101
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,520
It's not pulling anything up, right?

102
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:21,500
So here's a really easy way to find the, not an easy way, but a good way, and sometimes

103
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,320
it takes a little bit of work.

104
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:27,220
One way that you can find the business owner's personal Facebook profile, if they have one,

105
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,340
is I like to go to the Facebook page, okay, and as we know, Facebook pages suck.

106
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:35,640
They're not fun to look at, no one follows them, whatever, right?

107
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:39,180
So one thing you can do is you can go to the Facebook page, make sure it is the same one,

108
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:43,620
and then go down and look at their posts, and I want you to look at people that are

109
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,540
liking their posts, okay.

110
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:48,260
First of all, they typically are the only ones that like their own posts, so I'm gonna

111
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:54,020
look for McDowell, nope, okay, so there's no one with the last name McDowell that liked

112
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:57,700
it, sometimes the mom, the wife, whatever, will like it over and over, but I want to

113
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:01,300
pay attention to these names, and I'm gonna start looking for commonalities, the people

114
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:05,300
that keep liking the posts over and over, so I don't see any commonalities yet, but

115
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,660
I'm gonna keep looking, okay, so nothing on this one.

116
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:11,780
Let's go to the next one, four people like this one, oh, look, there's a Lynn, that looks

117
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:17,180
like a mom, that looks like a potential mom, grandma, let's go to Lynn McDowell, got the

118
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:22,740
same last name, we'll check out her profile, if it will load, okay, while that's loading,

119
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:29,700
I'm gonna keep going, okay, we're gonna look at this one, nope, there's another Lynn McDowell,

120
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:34,820
that's gotta be a relation, okay, go back to Lynn, now that we're on Lynn, we can go

121
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:43,820
to her friends, and we can search for Mike, oh, look at that, Mikey boy, there he is,

122
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:48,620
okay, so now we have Mike, he's the owner at McDowell Landscaping, it's the same page,

123
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:55,740
we just found it, okay, so that's one of my favorite ways to, let me go right here, boom,

124
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,540
and then I'll just scan through it and add some notes, so I'm like, okay, interesting,

125
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:06,540
looks like he's on a golf course, so, okay, I like this guy already, I'm kidding, right,

126
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:13,820
let's see, what else do we know about this guy, let's see, doesn't have a lot on here,

127
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:19,100
I went to Chandler High School, so he's a local, born and raised, it's not crazy, he's

128
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:23,940
from Canada, that's interesting, I would probably make a note of that, looks like he was an

129
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:28,580
estimator at Ace Asphalt, so this is a guy who's come from another company and started

130
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:32,180
his own, so there may need to be a little bit of sales training with him, there may

131
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:36,660
need to be, you might need to help him think bigger because he's coming from an employee

132
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:43,660
mindset, just things to note, I do like to look at their likes section, which tells a

133
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:50,660
lot, so, you know, American Wire, Aztec, Back the Blue, so he's a big cop guy, yeah, he's

134
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:59,780
conservative, he's got the Donald Trump stuff, yeah, this is what I like about this stuff,

135
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:05,100
right, impeached Joe Biden, I mean, you can tell a lot by what he's liked, like, I already

136
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:11,300
know about this guy, golf, he likes golf, he likes golf, very conservative, Tucker Carlson,

137
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:18,300
Trump stuff, let's see, Sal Sumo, yeah, I mean, I know, like, not everything, Lion's

138
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:27,540
Not Sheep, that's a guy to Utah, very conservative guy, like, he's a very, like, proud American,

139
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,940
it's funny because he's from Canada, conservative, and the only reason I say this, I'm not gonna

140
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:37,580
talk politics, I'm not, I will never do that, but now I kind of know, like, where he stands

141
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:43,520
on stuff, I know, like, you know, just, you can almost tell what, how somebody is based

142
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:47,780
on the things that they like on their Facebook page, which is scary, so maybe we should go

143
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:51,780
check what we're liking on our Facebook pages, but what I'll do is I'll just go in here,

144
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:58,780
and I'll go to notes, and I'll just put, from Canada, conservative, likes golf, former employee,

145
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:05,780
okay, and now, here's what's cool, is when I go to call this guy, when leads start coming

146
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:17,580
in, I know his name is Mike, I know, like, all this stuff about him, right, and you don't

147
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:21,020
want to be creepy, you don't want to call him, like, yo, that's how you're from Canada,

148
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:24,940
or you could, I've done that before, and you're like, hey, just so you know, like, before

149
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,640
I call anybody, I noticed you were paying for Home Advisor, so I went and checked you

150
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:31,280
out, and noticed you're from Canada, I wanted to, like, make sure you were legit, what part

151
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,800
of Canada you're from, like, now the guy's like, oh, this guy knows who I am, like, he's

152
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,760
not just, like, messing with me, so you could play it either way, but guys, it's so, so,

153
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,080
so important that we have these pieces of information, because when you call, and you

154
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,480
know his name is Mike, and you know he's from Canada, and you know these different things

155
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:53,100
about him, you're gonna know how to talk to him, and, more importantly, you are going

156
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:57,860
to be able to have that personal connection, because you actually have his name, so what

157
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:01,740
I want you to do is I want you to finish out your, whatever people, whatever business owners

158
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:07,580
you had on your list, I want you guys to fill this out completely, and I usually recommend

159
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:13,180
to have seven to 12 businesses on my list of people paying for ads, if I can help it,

160
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:17,380
they're all paying for Google ads, in this case, I'm gonna have to go with Home Advisor,

161
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:20,500
or something else, because there's not really that many people paying for Google ads in

162
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,980
this specific city, and then lastly, what I would say is this, because some of you guys

163
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:27,540
are gonna be looking at this going, oh my gosh, this is a lot, it is, it is, this is

164
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:30,820
a lot, and this is a time-consuming activity, so what I want you to be thinking about this

165
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:35,420
entire time is, how do you get into this, how do you master this, how do you do it well

166
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:39,420
enough that you could train it, and then what we're gonna do is we're gonna outsource it,

167
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:42,940
okay, because this isn't something you should be spending your own time on, eventually,

168
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:47,300
you should be outsourcing this to somebody else, but you have to master it first before

169
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:52,660
you can outsource it, okay, so once you get really good at finding these names, getting

170
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:57,460
creative about looking in the reviews, looking on the Facebook pages, doing smart searches,

171
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:01,020
one last thing I do wanna mention is if you can't find a business owner's name, a good

172
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:10,500
thing you can do is you can type in McDowell, like this, landscaping, LLC, and I like to

173
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:18,780
type in BBB, and I like to type in Arizona, okay, like that, and typically it'll pull

174
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:26,660
up a profile from the BBB, come on baby, let's go, it'll pull up a profile in a lot, and

175
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:30,740
more often than not, you're gonna find a lot of good information in this if it will load,

176
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:33,460
okay, so that's another really good resource, I do want this to load because I want you

177
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:39,980
to see what it is, so you have the Google ad reviews, you have, sorry, the Google reviews,

178
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:45,500
you have the Facebook reviews, and then this BBC thing I think is really, really powerful,

179
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,940
so this one doesn't have a ton of information on it, it just says, you know, a phone number

180
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:53,820
which is a BBB phone number, this doesn't say much, but a lot of times, oh, sorry, if

181
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:57,240
you scroll down it does, I lied, okay, here we go, so if we hadn't found the business

182
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:03,620
owner name, that BBB smart search helps a lot, you can go down here, it's an LLC, Mr.

183
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:10,140
Michael Stephen McDowell is the owner, so boom, there you have it folks, there is his

184
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:14,700
name as well, just some different tools, go ahead, find the information, get the list

185
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:18,260
built, and let's go get some leads and get a business owner on the hook.
