00:00.000 --> 00:04.400
But something that Linda said kind of stuck out to me more than anything else is she shared

00:04.400 --> 00:08.000
a story, if you guys haven't watched that interview, it's an awesome interview.

00:08.000 --> 00:14.160
She shared a story of a business owner that she was going back, she was doing the process

00:14.160 --> 00:15.160
with, right?

00:15.160 --> 00:20.120
She was going, everything was going good and she was supposed to do the Zoom call later

00:20.120 --> 00:21.120
that day.

00:21.120 --> 00:25.160
In fact, I think it was the same day, I think it was Thursday before the call.

00:25.280 --> 00:31.400
This business owner hit her up, like many of these business owners do, and said, hey,

00:31.400 --> 00:35.400
can we actually just reschedule the call, right?

00:35.400 --> 00:39.040
Can we reschedule the Zoom call, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, which is what a lot of them

00:39.040 --> 00:41.280
will do.

00:41.280 --> 00:45.640
Linda said that she's had a tough time in the past, but she's like, I'm tired of getting

00:45.640 --> 00:46.960
walked on.

00:46.960 --> 00:50.720
I'm tired of people yanking me around.

00:50.720 --> 00:57.240
She literally told the guy, she's like, I'm working exclusively with one company.

00:57.240 --> 00:58.720
I'm interested in working with you.

00:58.720 --> 01:03.560
I think her exact phrase was like, if this is important to you, we need to talk today.

01:03.560 --> 01:06.080
We need to talk today.

01:06.080 --> 01:10.360
Because she was bold and she meant it and the guy knew she wasn't messing around, the

01:10.360 --> 01:14.880
guy rescheduled, which we don't know if he actually had something or what, it doesn't

01:14.880 --> 01:20.000
matter, but he rescheduled whatever he had that was keeping him from that call.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.320
He pulled over, they did the call, and she inked the deal.
