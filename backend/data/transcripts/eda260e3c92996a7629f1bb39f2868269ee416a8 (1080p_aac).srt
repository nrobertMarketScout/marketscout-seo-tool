00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,420
["Take Me By Your Side"]

2
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:14,440
Guys, it's time to freaking close the deal, baby.

3
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,400
And everything, again, I've said this on the last video,

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,280
I've said this multiple times,

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,300
everything that we are doing up until this point

6
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,480
is leading us to this moment, okay?

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,560
And that's not to psych you out,

8
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,680
that's not to spook you out,

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,240
that's not to overthink it or get nervous

10
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,120
or get sweaty palms.

11
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,660
Guys, if you've done this correctly,

12
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,380
I need you to also remember as serious as this moment is,

13
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:33,620
if you've done this correctly,

14
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:34,720
this should be a piece of cake.

15
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,460
There should be very little apprehension,

16
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:40,220
very little in terms of objections and all that kind of stuff.

17
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:43,660
You're just gonna be relaxed, but be in the moment, okay?

18
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,180
I'm excited, I love this part.

19
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,460
This is literally what I live for.

20
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,820
And I will tell you that back

21
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,060
when I first started doing sales,

22
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,660
this part freaked me out

23
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:54,620
because I knew that I was going into a bloodbath

24
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,060
and they were gonna object

25
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,420
and I was gonna have to say these things

26
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,760
I didn't wanna say and all this stuff.

27
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,800
Well, guess what?

28
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,640
We do the setup correctly

29
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,880
so that we don't have to go through that, okay?

30
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,320
So one thing I want to mention really quick

31
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,560
before we hop over to the closing script

32
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,920
which we're gonna go through

33
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,680
is I wanna talk really quickly about rapport.

34
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,320
So as soon as the customer jumps onto the Zoom,

35
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,200
it's fine to spend a few minutes just like,

36
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,040
hey, how's it going?

37
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,480
Or maybe they have something on the wall

38
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,040
and you ask them a question.

39
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,720
But guys, I used to think like when I first started,

40
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,560
I heard about rapport

41
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,640
and I thought you needed to talk about fly fishing

42
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:32,640
or guns or trucks, golf, something like that

43
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,040
for 30 minutes to build rapport, okay?

44
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,240
And I realized that's not what rapport is.

45
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,200
Rapport is showing the customer

46
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,600
that you know what they're,

47
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,680
first of all, you care.

48
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,000
First of all, or second of all,

49
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,040
that you have what they need.

50
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,840
Third of all, you know what the hell you're talking about.

51
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,360
And fourth of all, that you know how to get them a result

52
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,940
and you are there for business, okay?

53
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:57,200
Above all, it's showing them that you're professional

54
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,840
and you mean business and you don't need to be rude.

55
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,040
You don't need to cut them off,

56
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,200
but you do not need to spend 30 minutes

57
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,840
talking about fly fishing or generators or food storage

58
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,560
or whatever weird thing they're into

59
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,720
that you can make a connection.

60
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,680
I know that people think that sales, it's not.

61
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,720
Sales is getting in saying, hey, look, Mr. Business Owner,

62
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,160
I wanna respect your time.

63
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,520
I wanna respect my own time

64
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,400
and I wanna get into this, let's go, okay?

65
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,080
They're gonna go, oh shit, this guy means business.

66
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,520
This lady, she means business and let's go, okay?

67
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,320
So don't feel like you need to do that.

68
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,680
I do occasionally, you'll notice in some of the videos

69
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,680
that I've shared or that I will share,

70
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,640
I'll see something, an African painting and go,

71
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,060
hey, just so you know, where are you from?

72
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,880
Okay, cool, I actually lived in Africa.

73
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,240
I make a connection, but it's not necessary

74
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,840
and I don't dwell on it, okay?

75
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,480
So let's hop over to the closing script.

76
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,040
Okay, guys, we are at the FFM Closing Script 2.0.

77
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,680
I'm actually really excited to say that this has changed.

78
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,680
So when we filmed module one live back in December of 2021,

79
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,920
we had a different script.

80
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,400
Now, it's very similar, but we have,

81
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,400
or when I say we, I have gone in, I have looked at this,

82
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,740
basically what was happening is I realized it was too long

83
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,360
and I was like, look, we gotta figure out a way

84
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,100
to shorten this up, this is taking way too long.

85
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:21,000
So I basically said, I'm gonna test this out

86
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,160
and I started doing the script,

87
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,240
but I started pulling chunks of it out, okay?

88
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,480
And I started testing it.

89
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,020
And after about a month of having the exact same result

90
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,840
and closing at a really high rate,

91
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,840
I realized I could remove a bunch of the script.

92
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,680
So if you guys have 1.0, you're gonna see

93
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,200
that there's stuff that's taken out of it

94
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,340
that I think that it was unnecessary, okay?

95
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:43,320
So this is the latest, the greatest, the leanest,

96
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,160
and I'm trying to continue to shorten this

97
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,040
because I don't think it needs to be super long, okay?

98
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,200
But what I wanna do here is I just wanna go through it.

99
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,140
I'm gonna have, and as you guys have seen,

100
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,860
I have tons of examples of me doing this live.

101
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,420
The best way to give you this example

102
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:02,660
and showing you how I do this is give you live sales calls.

103
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,020
And so I'm gonna continue to do that.

104
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,020
So I wanna just go through this step by step, okay?

105
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:10,740
So here at the top, I just have a couple of reminders.

106
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,560
I would recommend printing this and putting it off,

107
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,520
putting it on your desk and studying this thing

108
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,700
over and over and over because if you can learn this

109
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,620
like the back of your hand, you're not gonna have

110
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,420
to refer to it over and over.

111
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,580
And by the way, I will tell you that there are students,

112
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:29,500
I've watched some of your recordings of your first deals

113
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,060
and I have literally watched,

114
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,840
you look at the business owner over here

115
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,300
and read the script over here and still close the deal.

116
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,820
Like word for word, read the script.

117
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:41,620
So if you feel at any point you don't know what to say,

118
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,300
just go back to the script, okay?

119
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,860
It is very, very effective and very, very good.

120
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,820
Okay, I'm excited about this guys

121
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,360
and I do wanna say one last thing, not to toot my own horn,

122
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,680
but this is not a script that I Googled,

123
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,840
this is not a script I borrowed and built on.

124
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,320
I built this from scratch and I built this from scratch

125
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,400
based on the experiences that I've had,

126
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,960
based on thousands and thousands,

127
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,400
sitting at thousands and thousands of kitchen tables,

128
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,320
sitting on thousands, well not thousands,

129
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,640
probably hundreds of Zoom calls, soon to be thousands,

130
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,000
maybe we're close to thousands,

131
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,720
but this is a script that I've built,

132
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,120
tweaked, tested, torn apart, put back together.

133
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,960
It has been refined and refined

134
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,140
and will continue to be refined.

135
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:27,360
It is a living, breathing document and it works.

136
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,200
And I'm proud of that, but I want you to know

137
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,720
this is not a script that I pulled and said,

138
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,000
let me just tweak it.

139
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,640
No, this is from scratch.

140
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,840
I pulled open a document and I said,

141
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,880
all right, let's start building this out.

142
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,640
And it was a blank canvas and this is the masterpiece

143
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,240
and it works, okay?

144
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,040
So also note, this is the same script I used

145
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,020
when I launched this program to get the first 30 of you

146
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,660
to join the program.

147
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,620
It's also the script that every single one of you

148
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,460
that's got on a one-on-one Zoom call with me,

149
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:58,380
I have used this exact same format

150
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,700
to get you into the program.

151
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,180
So if you wanna talk about being sold on your product,

152
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,260
you wanna talk about a product that works,

153
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,620
you wanna talk about drinking the Kool-Aid,

154
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,660
I'm drinking my Kool-Aid,

155
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,940
because I'm literally using the script

156
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:13,220
to get you into the program that I'm actually selling you on.

157
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,500
So work that one through your head.

158
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,260
All right, let's go into this.

159
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,900
First thing that I do, I got a little asterisk here,

160
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,860
I wanna keep this video condensed, so let's go into it.

161
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,500
First thing I do, I take the pressure off,

162
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,460
I let them know, hey, I'm not the hard close guy,

163
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:28,940
I'm just looking to see if this is a fit, okay?

164
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:31,020
That is literally it and I let them know,

165
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,640
I'm like, hey, I don't have a big spiel for you,

166
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,380
even though secretly I kinda do.

167
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,780
I'm like, hey, I don't have a big spiel.

168
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:38,020
So just take the pressure off.

169
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,620
The less pressure they feel,

170
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:42,020
the better chance you have of closing it, okay?

171
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,420
And then I talk first about the purpose of the call.

172
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:47,220
So some points that you can choose to hit on

173
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,700
and you'll notice in my calls, sometimes I hit on them,

174
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,540
sometimes I don't, but I try my best to do it is,

175
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:55,300
some of the things I cover is, hey, look,

176
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,740
I'm not looking to do this for the next few months,

177
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,260
I'm not looking for a one month deal,

178
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,100
I'm trying to figure out if I can work with you

179
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:01,940
for the next 10 years.

180
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,820
I can make you money, you can make me money

181
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,340
and we can have a symbiotic relationship for 10 years.

182
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,660
So I'm looking to make sure this is a good fit, okay?

183
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,540
Just so you know.

184
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:12,460
And then I'll tell them, hey, my objective is to figure out

185
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,120
where you're at and you guys probably remember

186
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,500
some of this stuff when I was talking to you

187
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,820
because my objective is to find out where you're at today

188
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,300
and where you wanna go, okay?

189
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,620
And if my product, my leads can help you get

190
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:24,060
to where you wanna go from where you're at fast,

191
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,260
then we got a really interesting conversation

192
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,540
we're probably gonna be able to make something work.

193
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:30,180
And if it doesn't, Mr. Business Owner, I will tell you,

194
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,340
I will be the first to end this call and I'll end it early

195
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,180
because the time is the one thing that we can't get back,

196
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,020
okay?

197
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:40,300
Also, I put, here this kind of go in with that last point,

198
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:43,900
if my exclusive concrete leads help you achieve that goal,

199
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,860
that's the same thing, okay?

200
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,160
It's just kind of tied in.

201
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:48,860
Boom.

202
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,460
And then I also will sometimes hit on this a lot

203
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,620
and I'll say, hey, look, and I told some of you guys this,

204
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,500
if this isn't a good fit, I'm not gonna push it

205
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,020
because I'm not interested in trying to sell you

206
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,820
every single month on why you should stay with me,

207
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:00,940
why you should be with me.

208
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,540
I want somebody that's in this for the long run

209
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:05,100
and I wanna make a lot of money together, okay?

210
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,180
And then this is very, very important.

211
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,780
My only ask, this is why I put it in italics, okay?

212
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,260
And you can say some version of this.

213
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:14,300
Don't put pressure, but say something to this extent

214
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,020
is I say, hey, like I told you,

215
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:18,260
my only ask is this, man, or lady.

216
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,620
I've got a call in a couple hours.

217
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,260
All I ask is that at the end of this, if this is a fit,

218
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,620
let's rock and roll, let's shake and bake, let's do this.

219
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,940
I truly believe money loves speed.

220
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,460
I might even be wearing a sweater.

221
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,820
So all I ask, if this makes sense, let's do it.

222
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:33,940
Let's not hobnob around and you leave me in I don't know zone.

223
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,740
That's the only thing I ask, okay?

224
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:38,580
And also, if it's not a fit, just tell me straight up,

225
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,900
I'm a big boy, I'm a big girl,

226
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,260
you're not gonna make me lose sleep.

227
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,380
That's my only ask.

228
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:44,700
We on the same page, okay?

229
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,500
That's basically me saying, hey, look, bro, look, lady.

230
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,620
All I ask is that you give me a yes, no at the end of this,

231
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:50,900
but I'm saying it in a little bit different way

232
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,340
so I'm not adding the pressure, okay?

233
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:57,780
So first thing after you kind of set the stage

234
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,260
is I wanna learn about their company.

235
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:01,580
Guys, get interested in this part, enjoy this part.

236
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,260
Get a piece of paper, get a pen.

237
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,860
I have a yellow notepad sitting there in my remarkable.

238
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,220
And I literally, I tell them, I say,

239
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,540
I wanna learn just a little bit.

240
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,740
I wanna ask you a couple questions

241
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,060
to figure out where you're currently at.

242
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,160
And these are the questions I'll ask.

243
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,920
I'll be like, hey, and I'll tell them,

244
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,800
hey, I don't wanna be weird, I don't wanna be intrusive.

245
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,320
I wanna know these things

246
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,760
because I wanna find out where you're at

247
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,720
and then where you wanna go.

248
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,360
So just so you know, I'm not trying to peek

249
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,680
into your life too much, but it does matter to me

250
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,840
because I wanna see if I can help you, okay?

251
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,880
So some of the stuff I will ask them, what's your, hey,

252
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,760
so tell me, how much revenue did you do last year, right?

253
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,200
How much, how much, okay?

254
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,940
And I'll say, so okay, cool, you did a mill last year.

255
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,840
What do you wanna do this year, okay?

256
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,000
And then I'll ask them like, how does,

257
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,600
so like, how does your business make money?

258
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,960
Like tell me, I know you're in concrete.

259
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:50,260
Do you do more of the commercial jobs?

260
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,360
Do you do more of the residential?

261
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,320
How are you currently getting your business?

262
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,520
Like all of those things, I just wanna find

263
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,600
as much information as I can

264
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,360
so that I can figure out if I can actually help them.

265
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,000
Because if they start telling me, hey,

266
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,200
all we're looking to do is get commercial jobs.

267
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,000
First of all, I should already know this by now

268
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,040
and that's probably not a good fit

269
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,240
because most of these leads aren't commercial.

270
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,840
But if they sit there and go, hey,

271
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,560
we're plenty good on residential.

272
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,720
We only want commercial.

273
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,600
I'm gonna tell them, hey, just to be honest with you,

274
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,560
Mr. Business Owner, Mrs. Business Owner,

275
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,260
most of these jobs, 75% of them are gonna be residential.

276
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,760
So if that's gonna be an issue, I'm not gonna lie to you

277
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,000
and tell you they're all gonna be commercial.

278
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,520
There are gonna be some, but I don't wanna waste your time.

279
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,880
A lot of this is gonna be residential.

280
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,420
However, I will tell you this.

281
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:32,960
When you have an overflow of residential concrete leads,

282
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,840
you can do something called cherry picking,

283
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:39,140
which is charging premium and pick the best jobs.

284
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:39,980
Excuse me.

285
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:45,560
Having too many leads is not actually a bad thing, okay?

286
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,660
I also ask them, what's the end goal?

287
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,820
And again, guys, my biggest thing with this

288
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,140
is because you can add questions,

289
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:53,020
you can take questions away,

290
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,900
find out what makes them tick

291
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:55,740
and what's important to them.

292
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:56,920
And they're gonna give you,

293
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,400
this is a really important question

294
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,180
because they're gonna give you some bullshit answer

295
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,860
and say, well, I wanna make $2 million a month, right?

296
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,740
I wanna get the five million, okay, cool.

297
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,580
Why?

298
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,940
And Mr. Business Owner, I don't want you to feel

299
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,660
like I'm being that just weird,

300
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,420
but why do you wanna get there?

301
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,300
What is it actually?

302
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,620
You wanna get the five million, why?

303
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:17,500
Because do you wanna be, is it a recognition thing?

304
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,140
Do you wanna prove somebody wrong?

305
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,420
Do you have a vendetta for somebody?

306
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,840
Is it your old boss?

307
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,160
Or do you wanna go golf?

308
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,820
Do you wanna go and spend more time with your family?

309
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:28,060
Do you wanna be able to start other businesses?

310
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,540
They love talking about this stuff

311
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:32,300
and it's really interesting if you actually care

312
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,140
to find out.

313
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,860
And you guys know, I ask you the same thing.

314
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,980
I'm like, hey, what do you wanna do?

315
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:38,160
Okay, I wanna get to 10K, I wanna get to 50K.

316
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,680
Cool, cool story, bro.

317
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,280
Why do you really wanna get to 50K?

318
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,120
What do you wanna do?

319
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,320
Is it just one big F you to the world

320
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,680
that you just wanna prove everyone wrong

321
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,600
and get a chip on your shoulder?

322
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,760
If so, awesome, tell me about it.

323
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,960
I'm right there with you, man, and that's the truth.

324
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,960
Do you wanna go play golf?

325
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:57,560
Do you wanna be Tim Ferriss and go sip my ties on the beach

326
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,380
and have people rub lotion on your belly?

327
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,320
I'm cool with that, just tell me about it.

328
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,360
Like, I wanna be able to help you get there, okay?

329
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,400
And ask them and really, really care.

330
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:09,320
And it's important that you dig into their why, okay?

331
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,140
Now, you don't need to go so deep

332
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,240
that it feels like you're doing a therapy session,

333
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,600
but I want, get them to start talking real with you, okay?

334
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,240
Get them to start sharing something

335
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,680
other than I wanna get to 5 million.

336
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,840
That's like, oh, that's such a surface level goal.

337
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,680
Guess what?

338
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,000
I wanna get to a million a month.

339
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,780
I wanna get to 10 million a month, okay?

340
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,000
But it's so much deeper than that,

341
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,640
and I've told you guys, I wanna get those moments

342
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,880
where I set these goals that I never thought I could hit

343
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,720
and I hit them.

344
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,800
I want a Rolodex of exhausted but satisfied moments.

345
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,000
I know what my thing is.

346
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,360
I know what my why is, so it'd be really easy to answer.

347
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,700
A lot of these guys don't know, or a lot of these girls,

348
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,480
you gotta dig in, okay?

349
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,220
So, once we've gathered all that, say awesome.

350
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,840
And then what we're gonna do

351
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,180
is we're gonna start sharing the screen,

352
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:56,600
but I put right here, preface the pitch, okay?

353
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,320
So I share the screen and I don't share it until now

354
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,940
because maybe you have the script pulled up or whatever.

355
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:03,780
Make sure everything's clean and go,

356
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:04,700
okay, hold on one second.

357
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,780
Let me go ahead and share my screen.

358
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:06,700
Make sure you can see this.

359
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,740
This is why I wanna be on a desktop.

360
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,740
And you're gonna preface the pitch, okay?

361
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,460
So, first thing you're gonna do is you're gonna go,

362
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:16,100
just so you're aware, our objective is we go into markets

363
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,280
that are low-hanging fruit.

364
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,060
Essentially, the reason I got ahold of you

365
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:21,460
and the reason we're targeting Queen Creek

366
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,820
is because there's a lot of people looking for concrete

367
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,220
and there's not a lot of competitors

368
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,380
because everybody wants to go after Phoenix.

369
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,040
So we have this really cool opportunity.

370
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,860
That's why I'm calling you, just so you know.

371
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:31,860
I don't call everybody.

372
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,340
I'm not calling somebody in Mesa

373
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,460
and somebody in Glendale and somebody here and there.

374
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,760
I'm looking at Queen Creek

375
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,600
and I'm gonna work with one person exclusively

376
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,380
because there is an opportunity

377
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,740
that either you're gonna take or somebody else is gonna take

378
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,420
and I'm excited about it, okay?

379
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,600
So you're gonna preface it and you're gonna tell them,

380
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:50,340
just to be candid with you, as I told you before,

381
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,140
I've been reaching out to the best companies

382
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,340
that look like the best fit

383
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,700
and we wanna work exclusively with one company.

384
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,600
Again, you're planting these seeds, right?

385
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,060
You wanna let them know you work exclusively, okay?

386
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:04,260
All right, one thing I did note here as a reminder

387
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,540
is the sell through the client.

388
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:09,180
So, and I'm gonna talk about that in greater detail.

389
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,340
We have live streams that we've done on this concept

390
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:14,660
but anyway, you're gonna wanna sell through the clients

391
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:17,300
and instead of it being like, oh, if they ask a question,

392
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,780
instead of you handling it saying, oh yeah,

393
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:21,340
here's the answer, you're gonna go, hey, great question.

394
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:24,660
That's exactly what my client Joe in St. George

395
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:27,580
had the exact same question and here's what he discovered.

396
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,420
Remember that?

397
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:31,220
He also felt found and also selling through the clients.

398
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,060
Sorry about that, guys.

399
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,460
Anyway, so let's keep going, okay?

400
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,140
So the first thing, once I share the screen,

401
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,660
I'm like, all right, so let me show you something

402
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:41,820
and I come over here and I reemphasize

403
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,060
the market monopoly strategy.

404
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:46,580
Keep in mind, we have already shared this to some extent

405
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:49,140
in our pre-closed screencast.

406
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:52,140
So this is just reminding them, keeping it top of mind, okay?

407
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:57,460
One thing I totally left out and I, by the way,

408
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,420
I want this, like this is just how it is.

409
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,380
I kind of spaced it.

410
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,620
I want to make sure you guys remember.

411
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:05,180
Don't forget at the very first of the call

412
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:08,700
to make sure they watch the screencast, okay, that you sent

413
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,820
because if they haven't watched it,

414
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,500
and you should know because you should have tracked it,

415
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,580
but double check and make sure they watched it

416
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,220
because if not, that was a waste of time, okay?

417
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,980
And you're gonna have to overcome a lot of objections

418
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:21,260
that should have been covered in that, okay?

419
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:25,380
So first thing I do is I show them something like this.

420
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,220
I explain the monopoly strategy, okay?

421
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:28,700
And I don't need to go into too much detail.

422
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,460
You guys know what that is.

423
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,940
Basically more digital properties equals more money

424
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,780
is that's winning the game, okay?

425
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,300
And I'll show an example site.

426
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,740
So here I'm like, look, I work with a company

427
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,420
called Montgomery Construction.

428
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:43,140
As you can see, they're actually not even ranked,

429
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:46,300
but luckily I've been able to rank my homepage.

430
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,260
I've been able to rank the Google My Business

431
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,580
and I actually just noticed this.

432
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,300
I also have my Facebook page.

433
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,660
So I've been able to capture three

434
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:57,780
of the top 10 organic spots plus one map listing,

435
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:58,860
three in total.

436
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:02,660
So I'm almost banging down 33% of all the real estate

437
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:03,620
on page one.

438
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,180
That is why I'm winning, okay?

439
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:07,220
So I covered the market monopoly strategy.

440
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,460
I show an example.

441
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:12,500
And then you can also show, just really briefly go,

442
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,020
hey, and just to give you an idea of what this looks like

443
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:18,980
once we get to page one, this is the leads from June, okay?

444
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:21,020
And I'm not even gonna sit here and sometimes I will.

445
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:25,140
I'll go one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,

446
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:29,620
nine, 10, and I'll go 11, 12, 13, 14.

447
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,540
You get the point, right?

448
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:33,780
There's a lot of leads coming in and it is only,

449
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,660
it's not even through the end of the month, okay?

450
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,780
So I'll show them those three things.

451
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:38,860
I'll show them the example,

452
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:41,380
I'll show them the Bentonville concrete example,

453
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,060
and then I'll show them the leads if you have them.

454
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,820
Guys, you don't have to show the leads

455
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:45,660
if you don't have them, okay?

456
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,620
Don't worry about that, okay?

457
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,260
So market monopoly strategy,

458
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:53,780
and then I mean, I go really deep into that.

459
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,340
Like that is basically it.

460
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,500
So I'm gonna show them that,

461
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,020
I'm gonna show them the site,

462
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:00,260
and then I'm gonna show them the leads, okay?

463
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,340
And then what I ask them is a really important question.

464
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:05,740
I say, hey, do you have any questions

465
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,500
about like how this works, anything like that

466
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,260
before we go into price, okay?

467
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,540
Or cost, whatever.

468
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:14,900
And they might, and this is where they might ask a question

469
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,340
and it might give you some insight

470
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:18,460
into what they're thinking, okay?

471
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:20,460
And then what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna explain

472
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:21,860
and I'm gonna go, hey, like the video

473
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:22,860
that I sent you yesterday,

474
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,700
so just real quick to understand

475
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,500
why we structure this how we do.

476
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,660
We don't do commission or paper lead.

477
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:29,780
And I'm sure you can understand,

478
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,420
commission does not make sense, period.

479
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,420
Like we just don't do it.

480
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,660
And just cut it off, say it bluntly,

481
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,220
we do not do commission, never have.

482
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,980
Doesn't make sense, you have no skin in the game,

483
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,380
I have no incentive to get you leads.

484
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,820
It's a dumb model.

485
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:43,340
Now let me tell you, we used to do paper lead.

486
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,340
And let me tell you what happened, okay?

487
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,640
And I will share the example of the client that I had.

488
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,960
We started on paper lead, it was X amount per month.

489
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,660
I thought it was gonna be the sky's the limit.

490
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,000
Ended up that it wasn't.

491
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,620
They ended up canceling or they ended up bickering

492
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:58,940
and trying to beat me down on price

493
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,700
and this lead and that lead.

494
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,040
It just didn't work out.

495
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,220
So here's why we do what's called flat fee, okay?

496
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:08,100
And we put it on a pedestal and we explain it, okay?

497
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,500
And flat fee is the best.

498
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,220
And guys, you need to get sold on the fact

499
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,340
this is the best case scenario for you, of course,

500
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,420
because of the cards on file, but for them as well.

501
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,620
Because when your site does rank

502
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,620
and they go from 12 to 15 leads to 30,

503
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:23,980
are they really gonna be wanting to pay triple

504
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:24,980
what they started at?

505
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,280
Hell no, okay?

506
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,740
So it's good for everybody.

507
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,660
Okay, then what we're gonna do is we're gonna open up

508
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,260
the lead value calculator, okay?

509
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,220
And if you don't know or if you wanna wait,

510
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,060
you've done this a few times,

511
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:36,740
you can go ahead and put their numbers in here.

512
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,780
But I've already done that.

513
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:38,740
So we're gonna open this up

514
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,620
and we're gonna walk them through it, okay?

515
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:45,260
And explain that the price that we're gonna charge

516
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,380
or we're about to drop,

517
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:49,300
it is not based on how I'm feeling right now.

518
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,700
It's not based on what I think you can afford.

519
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,460
It's based on a mathematical equation, okay?

520
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:56,100
And so here's what we're gonna say.

521
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,580
So I put, explain the goal.

522
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,580
Sorry, explain that the goal is to come up with a price

523
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,540
that even with the worst case scenario,

524
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:05,820
Mr. Business Owner,

525
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,720
even if that worst case scenario happens,

526
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,680
you're still gonna make money, okay?

527
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,840
And explain that to them.

528
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:16,840
So to explain, hey, what if we do a deal

529
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,440
and there's, whatever, something crazy happens

530
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,880
and the leads are a little bit slow

531
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,840
and we only get you 10 to 12 leads per month.

532
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,640
That's what I'm basing the price off of.

533
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,720
I'm not basing it off of what if I do

534
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,000
what I did in Bentonville Concrete,

535
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,560
which is probably pretty likely, okay?

536
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,440
So explain that this price is based on worst case scenario

537
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,920
and then you're going to put the number in.

538
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,440
Say, hey, look, what I did is I calculated

539
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,440
and I said, what happens if I only get you 12 leads, right?

540
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,400
Well, based on these numbers right here,

541
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,960
even if I get you 12 leads,

542
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,600
Mr. Business Owner, Mrs. Business Owner,

543
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:56,600
you're gonna make $18,000 in gross profit per month, okay?

544
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,520
With 12 and I just showed you what's possible, okay?

545
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,960
And again, I don't even wanna do that

546
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,800
because some of you guys are gonna go,

547
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,760
oh, I don't have leads.

548
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,600
I'm showing them the leads and what's possible

549
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,600
because I have it, but if you don't have it,

550
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,320
you don't need to show them that, okay?

551
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,880
You don't need to worry about that.

552
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,960
And so, and say, Mr. Business Owner, Mrs. Business Owner,

553
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,640
at that price, or sorry, at 12 leads, only 12 leads,

554
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:25,960
you're still looking at $3,600 in net profit, okay?

555
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,760
And then what you're gonna do is you're gonna drop price.

556
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,760
You're gonna come over here

557
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,360
and you're gonna go, based on the numbers,

558
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,560
the price is $2,000 per month,

559
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:38,000
which we either do monthly or we do weekly,

560
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,320
and then, or you can insert price,

561
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:44,800
and here's the cool part, you get 100% of the leads.

562
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,320
You get 100% and they're all exclusive, okay?

563
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,600
You get 100% of the leads, they're all exclusive,

564
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,120
and then I put, just so you know,

565
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,040
it is gonna be a little bit slower in December

566
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,200
because of Christmas, okay?

567
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,000
This is me overcoming a future objection.

568
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,640
It is gonna be a little bit slower

569
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,600
because of Christmas in December, but guess what?

570
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,880
In the spring and in the fall, sometimes in the winter,

571
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,840
you're gonna see a huge uptick in leads,

572
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,440
and I'm not gonna come banging on your door

573
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,520
asking you for more money.

574
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,920
All I ask is don't call me on Christmas and bug me

575
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,560
because it is gonna slow down a little bit,

576
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:16,040
but that's the beauty of the flat fee, okay?

577
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,400
Okay, last thing is explain

578
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,640
that you have a six-month agreement.

579
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,200
So I say, so it's really simple.

580
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,080
Like I said, it's only 2,000 bucks per month,

581
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,760
or you can do it weekly at 400 bucks a week,

582
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,760
sorry, 500 bucks a week, and what we typically do

583
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,880
is I don't like to start with some two,

584
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,480
even a year contract.

585
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:36,000
I like to start with something that's at least long enough

586
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,680
to give this thing a fair shake,

587
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,920
but it's not so long that either of us feel tied in

588
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,320
because who knows, maybe in a few months

589
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,840
I find someone I wanna work with better.

590
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,480
Maybe you don't like the way I work

591
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,640
and I don't wanna be tied in forever.

592
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,120
However, I do need you to commit

593
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,640
to at least some period of time

594
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,640
because look, I'm committing to you

595
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:55,000
to be 100% exclusive, so it makes no sense

596
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,940
for you to be able to walk away at any time

597
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,900
because I'm not going and building other relationships.

598
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,300
I'm not talking to other business owners.

599
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:03,340
I'm married to you, and I need you to be married to me

600
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,300
at least while we're working together.

601
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,780
So what we do is a six-month deal.

602
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:06,820
At the end of the six months,

603
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:09,620
my intention is that we roll this into another year,

604
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,860
but at the end of the six months,

605
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,780
if you don't like it, it's no problem, okay?

606
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,420
That's how I explain the contract.

607
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:18,340
And guys, do not hesitate to bring up contract.

608
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,860
Do not be scared to bring up contract.

609
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,340
Do not bring it up timidly.

610
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,780
If you bring it up timidly, they're going to see that,

611
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:26,060
they're gonna sense it, and they're gonna exploit it, okay?

612
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:28,580
They're gonna say, yeah, hell yeah, I have a contract.

613
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:30,620
Like, what do you think this is, okay?

614
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,460
Like, that's the mentality.

615
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,700
Yeah, of course I have a contract.

616
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:33,860
I'm gonna be exclusive with you.

617
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:35,580
What do you expect, right?

618
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:38,460
That I'm exclusive with you, but you have no,

619
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,780
like, you can walk away at any time.

620
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,820
That makes no sense, okay?

621
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,460
No sense at all, okay?

622
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:46,580
Anyway, just explain that you have a contract,

623
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,860
and then here's what I do,

624
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:52,220
is I explain everything one more time that comes with it.

625
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:55,300
So we drop the price, okay?

626
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:56,980
So if you guys notice,

627
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,340
this is what we call a shit sandwich.

628
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:01,860
At the beginning, we're talking about the case studies

629
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:04,140
and how good it is, that's the bun, right?

630
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,140
So we got the bun, that's the good,

631
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,340
this is the case studies,

632
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:09,580
this is all the leads that we've gotten,

633
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:11,060
here's the results, blah, blah, blah,

634
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:13,780
and then the shit, which is the price,

635
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:16,660
because as much as I don't wanna say it's the shit,

636
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,860
it's what they're gonna have to pay, right?

637
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,220
So that's the patty.

638
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,540
So you got the bun, which is good,

639
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:21,780
you got the shit, which is the price,

640
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,180
and then you wanna add a bun,

641
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,900
that's the shit sandwich, to complete it,

642
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,280
you wanna add the bun before you ask for price.

643
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,220
So what you're gonna do,

644
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:31,380
is you're gonna lay out everything that they get,

645
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,100
before you go for the close,

646
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,620
which I'm gonna save for the next video,

647
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:36,820
and I will see you there.
