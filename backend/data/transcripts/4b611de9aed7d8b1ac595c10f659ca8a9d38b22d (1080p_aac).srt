00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,640
Alright guys, it's time to jump in to the core content.

2
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:19,840
It's time to get in, pick our city and niche and get going and get deals coming in and

3
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,400
close that first deal.

4
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,360
But I want to share really quick, this is how I want you to attack the content, okay?

5
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,280
I know I've been in other programs where they tell you, hey, watch the whole thing and then

6
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,320
come back and watch it again and do it.

7
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,960
I know I've been in other programs that just tell you all sorts of different things and

8
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,200
I'm not telling you that.

9
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,200
Here's what I want you to do.

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,200
I want you to watch a module, okay?

11
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,880
So we start with module one and then I want you to do the thing.

12
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,600
So module one talks about picking the city and picking the niche.

13
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:50,720
So you're going to watch that module and then you're going to pick the city and the niche.

14
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,560
And you're not going to go to module two until that's done, okay?

15
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,000
Then once you've picked the city and the niche because you've done the homework and the whole

16
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:01,040
deal, then you're going to go to module two and you're going to learn how to build a list.

17
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,040
And guess what?

18
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,080
You're going to build a list before you go to module three and you're not going to go

19
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,800
to module three until you build the list.

20
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:12,480
Because what I know is that in the times I have just gone and gone through all the content,

21
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,040
what happens is I listen to all this and I'm like, oh, cool, well, I'm just kind of like

22
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:20,520
passively soaking things in and I'm like, I get done, I'm like, oh my gosh, that's a

23
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,160
lot, that's a lot.

24
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:25,720
But if you take it in bites and you watch the first module and you don't allow yourself

25
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,040
to go to the next one until you've done the thing, done the actual action step, you have

26
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:35,000
a lot more, you go a lot quicker because you're just, you're tacking it in chunks, okay?

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,520
So I do want you to watch the module and then do it.

28
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,080
And then watch the next one and then do it.

29
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,840
And then watch the next one and then do it.

30
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,480
Because then by the time we get to module seven, we are pitching the business owner,

31
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,480
okay?

32
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,760
And we're getting a deal.

33
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,000
That is my advice.

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,600
Another little piece, I've had people that have gone through all of this in one day.

35
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,360
My recommendation is to watch a module a day and consume this over a week's time or maybe

36
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,880
even a little bit longer.

37
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,880
It's up to you, but I've had students that have literally watched every module in one

38
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,640
day and I'm telling you right now, even though it's my own stuff, I would probably want to

39
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:13,600
blow my brains out and I probably wouldn't retain much by the end of the day.

40
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:19,360
So I think the very best way to do this is watch a module and do it and do one module

41
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,760
a day and do it well, okay?

42
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,400
So guys, let's freaking do this.

43
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,680
Let's jump into module one, watch it, and then do it.
