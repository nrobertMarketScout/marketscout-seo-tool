00:00.000 --> 00:15.360
I have people ask me all the time, Nick, those that are in your program that take longer

00:15.360 --> 00:18.760
to get deals, those that are struggling a little bit, those that, you know, haven't

00:18.760 --> 00:22.360
got their deal yet, what are they doing wrong, what's going on, why, why, why, why, why,

00:22.360 --> 00:23.360
why?

00:23.360 --> 00:24.360
Well, I'm gonna tell you why, okay?

00:24.360 --> 00:26.400
And it's something I really want to point out.

00:26.400 --> 00:29.280
Some of you guys are coming to the table, some of you guys are just jumping to this

00:29.280 --> 00:32.240
program, this is your first introduction to Rankin' Rent, okay?

00:32.240 --> 00:35.240
Maybe you've done digital marketing, maybe this is your very first time doing a business,

00:35.240 --> 00:38.520
maybe this is your first time doing an online business, whatever the case is, some of you

00:38.520 --> 00:44.060
are brand new to this, others, some of you, or others, are coming and you guys have been

00:44.060 --> 00:48.520
in Rankin' Rent for years, you've taken other programs, you've done other things, you've

00:48.520 --> 00:54.040
been Udemy and whatever, Udemy and whatever, you've bought other courses, and you're coming

00:54.040 --> 00:58.640
to the table with 5, 10, 15 websites, and guys, here's the cool part, you can use this

00:58.640 --> 01:03.240
exact same process to sell other websites that are producing leads, okay?

01:03.240 --> 01:07.720
But here's what I want you to be careful of, the number one thing that I see, the number

01:07.720 --> 01:12.200
one hang up I see as far as people getting in the program, taking longer than they should

01:12.200 --> 01:16.920
to get their first deal, is people, it's the following, okay?

01:16.920 --> 01:22.200
People that come into this with existing websites, and in their head, they think the following,

01:22.200 --> 01:26.200
okay, here's what I'm gonna do, Nick, I'm gonna come in, I've got 5 sites, I'm gonna

01:26.200 --> 01:30.280
use this process, I'm gonna sell all 5, because I'm paying for hosting, I'm paying for phone

01:30.280 --> 01:33.400
numbers, I'm paying for this and that and the rest, I'm gonna sell all 5 of those, get

01:33.400 --> 01:39.280
clients, and then I'm gonna go do new projects, I'm gonna go pre-sell new websites, okay?

01:39.280 --> 01:43.760
And I get it, in a perfect world, and with an engineered brain, everything fits into

01:43.760 --> 01:46.760
a nice little box, and whatever, that's cool.

01:46.760 --> 01:49.960
But guess what, here's what I would ask you, and this is what I want you to ask yourself

01:49.960 --> 01:55.040
as you're going through this first module that you just went through.

01:55.040 --> 01:58.960
If you had known what I just went through, the videos that we just went through, the

01:58.960 --> 02:05.260
last few lessons that we just did, if you had known those things, and you're looking

02:05.260 --> 02:11.960
at your site, maybe you got a site in, you got a roofing site in Ontario, Canada, okay?

02:11.960 --> 02:17.520
If you had known what I just taught you, would you still have built this site, the one that

02:17.520 --> 02:20.440
you're thinking of, the one that you're like, hey, I'm gonna go ahead and use this process

02:20.440 --> 02:24.300
to sell it, would you still have built that site had you known what I just taught you?

02:24.300 --> 02:30.460
If the answer is no, then I do not want you to use that as your first site.

02:30.460 --> 02:35.720
I want you to either put it on the shelf and keep doing SEO, keep doing your regular thing

02:35.720 --> 02:37.780
on it, or get rid of it, okay?

02:37.780 --> 02:42.260
Because sometimes it's better just to cut it than try and squeeze blood out of a turnip

02:42.260 --> 02:44.540
or whatever that saying is, okay?

02:44.540 --> 02:47.660
And so what I've seen happen is people come in and they're like, hey, this site's getting

02:47.660 --> 02:53.240
like two or three leads, and then you look at the market research, it's really competitive,

02:53.240 --> 02:59.200
it's the wrong niche, the CPC is $10, $15, and they try and run it through this process,

02:59.200 --> 03:01.200
they're like, oh my gosh, why is it not working?

03:01.200 --> 03:06.160
Well, you're not following the criteria, you're not following the process that we just talked

03:06.160 --> 03:08.800
about for the last couple hours, okay?

03:08.800 --> 03:10.480
So here's what I want you to do.

03:10.480 --> 03:15.380
If you have existing sites that are producing leads, what I want you to do is I want you

03:15.380 --> 03:22.520
to run them through the exact same due diligence market research process that we just covered,

03:22.520 --> 03:23.520
all of them.

03:23.520 --> 03:26.760
Yes, I know, it's extra work, don't care.

03:26.760 --> 03:34.240
Go and do that, and if those sites fit the criteria, they're low-hanging fruit, they're

03:34.240 --> 03:42.040
layups, the CPC is under five but over zero, the volume matches, if those all check the

03:42.040 --> 03:47.480
boxes, you got some freaking gold on your hands, baby, and you should use that website

03:47.480 --> 03:49.460
first and you should go sell it, okay?

03:49.460 --> 03:54.660
If they do not fit the criteria, then you either need to put it on the shelf and keep,

03:54.660 --> 03:57.860
you know, do an SEO, doing your regular thing, or get rid of it, okay?

03:57.860 --> 04:02.540
Sometimes the best thing is just to get rid of the dang site and go on to stuff that actually

04:02.540 --> 04:03.540
works, okay?

04:03.540 --> 04:04.980
Here's the game.

04:04.980 --> 04:08.940
We need to get you to your first deal with this process, okay?

04:08.940 --> 04:13.540
I don't care how much money you're already making, I want to get you, I need to get you

04:14.540 --> 04:20.060
your first bit of money using this process, using the process, the results in advance

04:20.060 --> 04:22.460
process that we teach in this program.

04:22.460 --> 04:23.460
Why?

04:23.460 --> 04:27.340
Because if you can get the first deal, there's this mental barrier that gets removed, you

04:27.340 --> 04:31.940
go see it over and over and over, and there's tons of students in this program, some of

04:31.940 --> 04:35.860
you guys that are watching this right now, you've seen it in your own business.

04:35.860 --> 04:40.340
Takes you three years to get your first deal, you go in this program, you're in another

04:40.380 --> 04:43.700
program for three years, you come in this, you get your first deal, and it takes three

04:43.700 --> 04:45.220
weeks, and guess what?

04:45.220 --> 04:50.700
Your second deal takes four days, or a week, or two weeks, but it happens right after,

04:50.700 --> 04:51.700
and then guess what?

04:51.700 --> 04:54.420
You get another one, and you get another one, and if you keep working, you keep getting

04:54.420 --> 04:56.060
deals, so I know this game.

04:56.060 --> 05:00.820
The game is I got to get you to getting your very first deal using this process.

05:00.820 --> 05:03.340
I don't care if you've gotten previous deals, I don't care if you think you got deals because

05:03.340 --> 05:06.740
you got paper lead and commission deals, or even if you got a flat fee deal, I want you

05:06.740 --> 05:09.860
getting your first deal using this process, because what it's going to do is it's going

05:09.860 --> 05:13.780
to give you trust, it's going to give you that confidence in this process, it's going

05:13.780 --> 05:20.380
to remove that mental block that, oh, I can actually do this, and all of a sudden you

05:20.380 --> 05:21.380
take off.

05:21.380 --> 05:26.620
Guys, I just want to let you guys know before you go, I'm just going to go sell all these

05:26.620 --> 05:29.980
sites because I don't want to pay for hosting, maybe what you need to do is get rid of those

05:29.980 --> 05:30.980
sites.

05:30.980 --> 05:34.340
I'm not telling you that's the case necessarily, but maybe you do.

05:34.340 --> 05:36.380
Make sure that's the case before you just dive in.

05:36.460 --> 05:40.180
For those of you that are brand new, don't even worry about it.

05:40.180 --> 05:42.460
Follow the steps that we've talked about.

05:42.460 --> 05:43.460
Pick the niche.

05:43.460 --> 05:47.820
If you don't know what niche, pick concrete, do the homework, pick a great city.

05:47.820 --> 05:48.820
Let's go make some money.

05:48.820 --> 05:49.820
I'll see you guys in the next module.
