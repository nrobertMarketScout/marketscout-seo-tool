00:00.000 --> 00:02.440
Question, how do you handle the objection

00:02.440 --> 00:05.200
when you are pre-qualifying a business owner of,

00:05.200 --> 00:08.320
I wanna know how much it costs or what's the deal?

00:08.320 --> 00:10.280
I come across this objection in a call yesterday

00:10.280 --> 00:11.520
and I was at the point that I wanted

00:11.520 --> 00:12.780
to hang up the phone and move on.

00:12.780 --> 00:14.720
The fact that I said we could talk about it later

00:14.720 --> 00:17.080
didn't work, she was another level of persistence.

00:17.080 --> 00:19.920
So, Juan, I know we talk about this in the training,

00:19.920 --> 00:20.760
I don't know if you've gotten through

00:20.760 --> 00:23.440
the entire training yet, but I push it off

00:23.440 --> 00:26.060
as much as I can, mainly because I wanna take people

00:26.060 --> 00:29.160
through the whole process and I've experienced this before

00:29.800 --> 00:33.400
when I hired my setter, she started getting familiar

00:33.400 --> 00:35.560
with the process, she started hearing me pitch

00:35.560 --> 00:38.040
and they would start asking her, they were interested,

00:38.040 --> 00:40.920
if people are asking those questions, by the way, Juan,

00:40.920 --> 00:42.280
those are really interested people,

00:42.280 --> 00:44.860
those people are asking buying questions

00:44.860 --> 00:47.320
and that's somebody that's a good look, okay?

00:47.320 --> 00:50.080
They're asking the deal because they're internalizing,

00:50.080 --> 00:51.640
could this be a good fit?

00:51.640 --> 00:56.640
So, what you need to do is, what I train in the program

00:56.920 --> 00:59.480
as I say, I say something to the effect of like,

00:59.480 --> 01:02.240
hey, look, that's not even, that's way ahead

01:02.240 --> 01:04.200
of what we're even talking about here.

01:04.200 --> 01:06.200
Honestly, at this point, I just wanna get you

01:06.200 --> 01:09.320
a couple of free leads and we can talk about that

01:09.320 --> 01:11.880
in a couple of days, that's the easy part, ma'am.

01:11.880 --> 01:13.400
Ma'am, that is the easy part, I've done it

01:13.400 --> 01:15.480
and I always say something like, I've done everything

01:15.480 --> 01:18.560
short of taking food stamps for payment,

01:18.560 --> 01:20.760
knowing damn well that I won't do anything

01:20.760 --> 01:23.400
besides flat feet, but I don't wanna get them all nervous,

01:23.400 --> 01:25.480
I don't wanna get them thinking, oh, you know,

01:25.480 --> 01:27.480
if I just say, oh, we do a flat feet,

01:27.480 --> 01:29.360
all they're gonna do is they're gonna start thinking,

01:29.360 --> 01:32.560
well, I don't like flat feet because it's not guaranteed

01:32.560 --> 01:35.560
and I like to do paper lead and I wanna do a commission

01:35.560 --> 01:37.000
and by the time you get to the call,

01:37.000 --> 01:38.720
they're gonna come in and they're already gonna object

01:38.720 --> 01:41.460
and they're gonna say, no, I don't wanna do a flat feet, okay?

01:41.460 --> 01:46.460
But if you can shit on paper lead and commission

01:47.000 --> 01:50.560
in that screencast right before you get on the call,

01:50.560 --> 01:51.920
you're not gonna have any objections.

01:51.920 --> 01:54.120
So, I just like to keep it open and let them think

01:54.120 --> 01:55.720
that, you know, there's tons of options

01:55.720 --> 01:58.040
and I'm really just looking to find the right person

01:58.040 --> 01:59.620
before we talk about that.

01:59.620 --> 02:02.300
Now, if they're ultra persistent,

02:02.300 --> 02:04.040
which by the way, I've dealt with that before

02:04.040 --> 02:05.520
and it just gets to the point where it's like,

02:05.520 --> 02:07.480
you're gonna lose, they'll say, yeah,

02:07.480 --> 02:09.200
we've done a couple of different things.

02:09.200 --> 02:11.920
Most often, what works the best is doing something

02:11.920 --> 02:14.600
that's on a flat rate, that way, you know,

02:14.600 --> 02:17.320
your marketing budget isn't gonna soar up in the spring

02:17.320 --> 02:20.200
when we get tons of leads and one thing I don't do,

02:20.200 --> 02:21.840
by the way, is commission and I'll tell them straight up,

02:21.840 --> 02:23.680
I'm like, the only thing I don't do is commission

02:23.680 --> 02:25.240
and that's because you got no skin in the game

02:25.240 --> 02:26.520
and I'll tell them straight to their face

02:26.520 --> 02:27.800
because I will not do commission

02:27.800 --> 02:29.520
and there's no skin in the game, that makes sense

02:29.520 --> 02:30.520
and if they can't understand that,

02:30.520 --> 02:31.360
I don't wanna work with that person

02:31.360 --> 02:32.360
because they're stupid.

02:32.360 --> 02:34.340
Commission deal is the most stupidest thing

02:34.340 --> 02:36.160
on planet earth with paper lead stuff.

02:36.160 --> 02:38.400
They have no care in the world to close a deal.

02:38.400 --> 02:40.240
So, hope that helps one.

02:40.240 --> 02:42.680
I do know it's in the training, but yeah, a recap,

02:42.680 --> 02:44.920
just something, some kind of one-liner of like,

02:44.920 --> 02:46.960
that's honestly, man, that's the easy part

02:46.960 --> 02:47.800
of this whole thing.

02:47.800 --> 02:49.620
I've done everything short of taking food stamps.

02:49.620 --> 02:50.920
Let me get you a couple of these leads

02:50.920 --> 02:52.180
and then a couple of days we can talk about it

02:52.180 --> 02:53.240
if it ends up being a good fit,

02:53.760 --> 02:55.360
but let's not put the cart before the horse,

02:55.360 --> 02:56.480
something like that, okay?

02:56.480 --> 02:58.200
Make it smooth, make it not a big deal,

02:58.200 --> 03:01.920
but if it's persistent, just say something like that

03:01.920 --> 03:03.840
and tell them why right there,

03:03.840 --> 03:06.200
but you don't need to like go into tons of detail.
