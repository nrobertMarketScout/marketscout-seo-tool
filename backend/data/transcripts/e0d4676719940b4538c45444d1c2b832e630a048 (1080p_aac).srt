00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,680
Guys, happy Monday.

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,080
February 24th.

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:15,280
Time is cruising by, which is not a bad thing when you're getting stuff done.

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,600
One thing I want to say really quick, I actually told my, I think a lot of you guys are inside

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:27,040
of Digital Landlords, so I'm going to just remind you guys, if you have not ever, or

6
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:34,240
even if you have, I highly, highly, highly, highly, highly recommend you guys read this

7
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,340
book.

8
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,040
It's called The Slight Edge, okay?

9
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,000
I'll show you the cover here real quick.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,680
I cannot recommend this book enough.

11
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,720
I've got, yeah, Craig Smith, he's reading it, awesome, okay.

12
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:53,680
So this is what the cover looks like, okay, it's called The Slight Edge.

13
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,520
I'm on page 205, I don't know if that's, I'm on chapter 14, so I've just been reading

14
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:07,560
10 pages a day, and guys, this book has just reminded me that it's all the little things

15
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:13,400
that you do that add up to the success, and you're going to start reading this today,

16
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,500
and you're going to start to implement some little things, and you're not going to see

17
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,900
any results at the beginning.

18
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:23,280
It's going to feel like the exact same thing, whether it's, you know, let's just talk with

19
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,280
the business, right?

20
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,120
You're going to start to implement some things with the business.

21
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:34,760
Maybe your goal is, I'm going to make five cold calls, I'm going to make sure every single

22
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:41,800
day I talk to five business owners, I talk to five business owners with cold calling,

23
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,800
okay?

24
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:48,400
Not call, but talk to, and you're going to do it the first day, and you might not even

25
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,440
get anybody that's interested, and maybe the second day and the third day, you might do

26
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,440
it for a week.

27
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,840
You might do it for two weeks, because at the beginning your pitch isn't great, and

28
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,720
then what's going to happen is after a week, two weeks, you're going to start seeing that

29
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:09,040
somebody that you called day three actually calls you back, or somebody that you called,

30
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:14,600
you know, on day four that didn't answer, got your voice note, your voice memo, they

31
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:19,240
called you, they're interested, and all of a sudden all these little things that you

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
They start to stack up, and it's like everything is going in your way, and you have this thing

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,480
called momentum, and it's a beautiful feeling.

34
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,080
I have it right now.

35
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:37,120
I started this book literally a month ago, because I got back, I was in, I remember,

36
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,440
it was about this exact same day, almost exactly a month ago I started it.

37
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:48,600
I picked it up, I was kind of like, you know, I need to just get back to basics, fundamentals,

38
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:53,000
picked up the book, just read 10 pages, and then did it again, did it again, did it again,

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,360
and guys, it's been really, really good.

40
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,000
I've seen, I mean, I've got a lot of momentum, I feel good.

41
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,880
It's not just my business too, it's my physical, my, what other side of it.

42
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:12,200
I feel like with my physical definitely, with my relationships, so anyway, I don't make

43
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,520
any money off this book, I don't know Jeff Olson, all I can tell you is that I've recommended

44
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:20,920
this book to not just my digital landlords group, but I've recommended this to a bunch

45
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,320
of people that I know and care about.

46
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,280
So guys, go grab it.

47
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,400
This is one of my top five books, maybe my top three books, along with Think and Grow

48
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,400
Rich.

49
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,120
That's how much I like this book, it's like my fourth time reading it.

50
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:42,320
So there is a PDF that I shared, you can grab, just for ease of, I'll just go like this,

51
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:46,560
the Slide Edge PDF, let me just grab it for you guys to make it easy.

52
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,360
You can just type in the Slide Edge PDF and you're also going to find it, but let me just

53
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,560
go like this and I'll drop it in.

54
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:57,760
Okay, so yeah, you guys can get the PDF there, I like it on the Kindle so I can highlight

55
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:05,320
stuff and come back to it, drop notes in it, but anyway, all right guys, that is that.

56
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:09,880
What else was I going to say really quick before we dive into the questions, let's see.

57
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,800
Okay, here we go, let me show you guys.

58
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:17,520
All right, and I'm doing this because I know not everyone's on right now, but I'm going

59
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:23,360
to share my screen really quick for, let's see, we got Craig, Kevin, Paul, Simon, okay.

60
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,360
There's the PDF by the way.

61
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:35,720
Okay, last week, and I think a couple weeks ago too, I said, hey guys, when you go through

62
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:42,320
the classroom here, there's this mini course called Community World Map, okay, and I asked

63
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,520
everyone to put their location.

64
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,920
Why does it matter if you put your location, well, you don't have to put your location,

65
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:51,240
but I think it's really cool to put your location because, well, first of all, it's interesting

66
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,240
to look at.

67
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,680
Number two, it's cool because if you're traveling or you're anywhere and you want to link up

68
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,880
with somebody, you can just go and look at who's in that area, right.

69
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,440
We have over 250 members.

70
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,620
If everyone would fill this out, which a lot of us are in this area, it would be so interesting

71
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:12,120
to see where everybody's at, so I'm going to, I think I wasn't super clear and I didn't

72
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,280
even know this.

73
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,840
So I thought all you had to do, guys, is go, this is what I thought.

74
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:23,800
I thought you went to your profile, you went to your settings, and you changed your location.

75
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,160
That's what I thought, okay.

76
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,160
It's not the case.

77
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,620
What you got to do is you got to go here, you got to go to the classroom, you're going

78
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:37,780
to go to the map, of course, and then you're going to see this little purple button here.

79
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:42,860
You're just going to click on this and you're going to put add a location, okay.

80
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:46,640
Now I'm going to go back to another window here.

81
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:50,180
You're going to grab your, you're going to go to your profile and you're going to grab

82
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:58,140
this and you're just going to go into here and drop that.

83
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:02,700
Nicholas Wood, and then I'm going to put my location as Freetown.

84
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:06,660
I'm in the U.S. right now, but I'm going to be in Freetown in two weeks, so I'll put Freetown

85
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:13,300
and I'll submit it, and boom, there we go.

86
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:17,240
It drops me right here into Freetown, okay.

87
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:22,080
So guys, if you haven't done this already, it takes, what did that take me, 15 seconds?

88
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,080
Go do it.

89
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:26,380
I think it's so, I think it's really cool to look at first and foremost, and I think

90
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:32,660
it's so interesting to be able to connect with people and to just build the network.

91
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:36,220
I mean, guys, we're all trying to do the same thing and we're all at different stages of

92
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,220
the game.

93
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,660
We all come with different experience that we can tap into.

94
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:42,140
So guys, take two seconds today to do that.

95
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,140
Super easy.

96
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,020
Let's see really quick.

97
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:51,860
Simon says, can you highlight the difference between the mini course and the digital language

98
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:52,860
program?

99
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:53,860
Yes.

100
00:06:54,340 --> 00:07:02,120
So in a nutshell, Simon, this group right now, thanks Paul for doing that by the way,

101
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:06,180
this program that you're in right now, this Rankin' Rankin' Academy, the school community,

102
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,460
if you are in digital language, you have full access to this.

103
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:16,180
I think Craig, Kevin, and Paul, I think are all in digital language, if I'm not mistaken.

104
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:19,740
And essentially, this is just a place to get your feet wet, okay.

105
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:28,820
This is a place to understand from a conceptual level, the model, to get some pointers on

106
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:34,500
how to get started, to start seeing some wins in terms of like just moving the needle and

107
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,180
getting going, okay.

108
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,500
But digital landlords is when you do it for real.

109
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,100
So that's going to have everything and anything related to this.

110
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,280
It's going to have all the scripts.

111
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:49,020
It's going to have, I mean, it's got everything that you can possibly imagine.

112
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:54,500
And so like everything, if something new comes up, if I'm testing something new with ads,

113
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,500
I share it in there.

114
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:01,700
If I have this new strategy that I'm doing for prospecting, I share it in there.

115
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,780
It's basically got every single thing.

116
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:04,840
It's the blueprint.

117
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:08,580
So that is what digital landlords is.

118
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,580
So this is just the starter.

119
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:13,300
This is where you start and determine, hey, I want to go into this model for real.

120
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:18,180
And as soon as you are like, hey, I want to do this for real, then you go in and get into

121
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,180
digital landlords.

122
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,180
Okay.

123
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:27,780
One thing I will show you really quick on that note is if you, Simon, you should go

124
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,540
check out chapter 14.

125
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:33,820
If I can find it off the top of my head, let's see here.

126
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:34,820
I'm guessing here.

127
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:38,580
Let's see if I'm close on 14.

128
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,580
I think I'm a little further.

129
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,580
Okay.

130
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:41,580
So let me go right here.

131
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,580
This is the section.

132
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,700
Again, this is a, oh here, 13.

133
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,020
Go read this.

134
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,620
I read this last night.

135
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:51,900
This chapter called Learn from Mentors.

136
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,980
And this is such an amazing chapter.

137
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:59,140
And I don't tell you to do this just because I think, oh, if he'll read this, he's going

138
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,860
to get into our program.

139
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:01,860
No.

140
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:05,900
But even me reading this, I love this chapter.

141
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:10,140
And he shares this really amazing story about this guy that just gave him a little bit of

142
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,900
time every single day.

143
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,380
And he started to see himself differently and it completely changed his life.

144
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:18,820
But anyway, there's some good stuff that I highlighted.

145
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,820
I didn't read it on here.

146
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:23,780
I read it on right here.

147
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:26,940
Let me just read this one part, okay?

148
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:30,300
Let's go like this.

149
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:35,740
Whatever goals you aspire to, seek out people who have achieved the same or very similar

150
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:40,940
goals or who are well along that path and go camp on their doorstep or do whatever you

151
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:45,420
can to associate with them, emulate them, and let their grasp, understanding, and mastery

152
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,740
of the subject rub off on you.

153
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:50,980
What makes AA so successful is not the information they hand out.

154
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:54,820
It's the mentorship they provide, both as a community and as individuals.

155
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:58,620
When you join AA or any other 12-step program, you get instant access to a community of people

156
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:04,220
who have gone where you're going as well as an individual, mentor, or sponsor.

157
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:09,260
So this is one of five things I highlighted about this chapter.

158
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,260
Go read chapter 13.

159
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:11,580
Again, get the PDF.

160
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:16,940
You can read chapter 13 completely free today, and I think it's going to open your mind on

161
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:17,940
a lot of things.

162
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:18,940
Okay?

163
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:19,940
So yeah, go check it out.

164
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:20,940
Phenomenal book.

165
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:24,140
So let's keep going.

166
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,620
Was one more thing I wanted to cover.

167
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,340
Oh, yeah, this is exciting.

168
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:33,260
Guys, I got a new course dropping in March, just as a heads up, okay?

169
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,380
I've got a new course.

170
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:39,580
This is going to be a course that, again, for you guys that are in Digital Landlords,

171
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:44,260
all the stuff that I produce in here, you guys are going to get access to, and it's

172
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:48,300
probably just a, anything that I produce in here is probably just going to be a fraction

173
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,180
of something that I already have inside of Digital Landlords, okay?

174
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:56,620
But I will tell you guys, I do have a new course dropping inside of here in March.

175
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:00,060
So keep an eye out for that as well, okay?

176
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,900
And then lastly, guys, is just a reminder of the replays.

177
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:08,700
As soon as this call gets done, I upload it to Vimeo, I message my VA, and he waits for

178
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:14,020
it, he grabs it, and he puts it up within literally like an hour or two hours.

179
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,340
Let me show you one more thing, and then I'm going to go into Q&A.

180
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:19,220
Okay, guys, let me show you one last thing.

181
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:26,020
Okay, last thing I want to show you guys is something that I think is really helpful.

182
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:30,360
So as soon as you get off, you can check this out.

183
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:37,300
So if you go here, you go down to the replays right here, the replay will be dropped.

184
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:41,460
So you can see here, this is our kickoff call, so this is our 1, 2, 3, 4, 5th, this

185
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:46,820
is our 6th week, right, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6th, I'm actually going to have him add the date.

186
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:51,460
I'll make a note to have him add the date today because I want you guys to be able to

187
00:11:51,460 --> 00:12:00,260
see the date, let me write that down, add dates, dates to replay.

188
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:04,980
But needless to say, guys, what I like about these, we just started doing, is you can go

189
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:09,460
to it and we actually put the questions in the description that we answer.

190
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:15,180
So last week we covered, are there niches that are not region-specific, what is the

191
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:19,100
backlink data and where is the backlink data from, where are they coming from, like we

192
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:23,540
go through everything, do one-page websites rank well, all the questions that were asked,

193
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,540
we put in the description.

194
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:28,060
So you can go to these Q&As and be like, all right, is any of this stuff things that I

195
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:31,940
actually am interested in or that I have questions about, and then you don't have to go and watch

196
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:34,140
the entire thing, okay?

197
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:39,260
Maybe what I should try to do is see if I can do a timestamp, I'll add that as well,

198
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,220
make it even easier for you guys.

199
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:44,060
But I also want you guys to be on these lives, so maybe I shouldn't make it too easy on you

200
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,060
guys.

201
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:48,580
I like when you guys are on these lives, it gives me a lot of energy to be able to talk

202
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,580
to you guys live.

203
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:53,820
Even if no one showed up to this, I would still do these calls, but yeah, just so you

204
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:54,820
guys know.

205
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,380
All right, guys, what questions do you have?

206
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,380
Let's get into that.

207
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:02,780
Let me look under the school community while I look or I wait for you guys, let me see

208
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,900
what questions we had.

209
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:09,260
And let's get into this, okay?

210
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:12,260
Let's see.

211
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:19,460
Oh, that's why I already recommended this book in this group as well, I'm sorry.

212
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:20,460
That's why people said they're reading it.

213
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:22,820
Book is changing my life, I forgot.

214
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:23,820
I was so pumped.

215
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:28,060
After I started seeing the results of this book, I started sharing it with everybody.

216
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:30,260
Okay, let's see.

217
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,260
I don't know if there was any.

218
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:36,980
Let me go under the question section, let's see.

219
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:39,780
There's any new stuff?

220
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:43,940
If not, I'll go into, I have another place I'll answer questions to make it easy for

221
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:46,540
you guys, but I'm going to keep an eye on the chat here.

222
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:49,180
So, guys, if you guys have any questions, let me know.

223
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,180
This is what I'll do.

224
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:55,340
I'm going to go over to, I'm going to go over to YouTube really quick.

225
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:59,900
I always get interesting questions here.

226
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:00,900
Let's see.

227
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:11,940
All right, I'm going to go to my comments to see what questions we have.

228
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:12,940
Here's a good question.

229
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:13,940
I'm going to answer.

230
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,580
Guys, again, I'm going to prioritize your questions.

231
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:19,620
I'm just going to start going through a few questions in YouTube and then also in the

232
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:24,620
Facebook group and obviously, school, if I see anything pop up, but yeah, I'll prioritize

233
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,340
your questions as they come up, okay?

234
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:29,360
So this is a question that somebody had.

235
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:36,840
This was on a video that I posted on YouTube that was talking about how the rank and rep

236
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,840
business has changed.

237
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,840
This person said this.

238
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:45,560
He said, in terms of saturation, do newbies stand a chance against seasoned agencies?

239
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,960
So let's just say, let's take Simon, for example.

240
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,560
Simon just started doing this.

241
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,240
I think he did.

242
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:57,480
Does Simon have a chance to do this against somebody like myself who's been doing this

243
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,520
since 2016 and been seriously doing this since 2020?

244
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,520
That's the question.

245
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:09,480
Well, the truth is, guys, is that it's the wrong question because this person's thinking

246
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,560
about this in terms of a scarcity mindset.

247
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:17,000
They're thinking about this in terms of if they get a deal, then it's taking one out

248
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,440
of my pocket, or if I get a deal, it's taking one out of their pockets.

249
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,320
It's a scarcity mindset, right?

250
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:30,800
The success that Paul has, or the success that Craig has, has nothing to do with me.

251
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,800
It doesn't affect me.

252
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,600
It doesn't take money out of my pocket.

253
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,520
That's something that people get confused.

254
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:41,080
Just because Paul goes and lands a deal today does not take money out of my pocket.

255
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,080
Here's a good example.

256
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:47,880
My little brother, he just called me on Saturday and he was like, and by the way, for those

257
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:52,120
of you in digital landlords, tomorrow we're going to be doing a post that's going to let

258
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,120
you guys know this.

259
00:15:53,120 --> 00:16:00,160
We're going to be doing a really interesting live, a very value driven live on how to replace

260
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,160
clients quickly.

261
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:05,160
You get those clients, they're bad, sorry, how to replace bad clients quickly.

262
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,560
He ended up finding out he had two bad clients and he's at 10.6.

263
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,960
He's like, I don't want to go back.

264
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,840
I want to replace them as soon as possible.

265
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:16,400
He actually replaced two clients on Saturday back to back.

266
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,800
He's going to be sharing those strategies.

267
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,560
He called me and he told me this story and he's like, yeah, I landed these two clients.

268
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,080
Guys, I didn't think in my head, oh, Porter got two more deals.

269
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,520
That's two deals that I could have got.

270
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:33,960
The question is flawed because just because this person gets a deal or just because Paul

271
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:38,400
or Craig or Simon or anybody else in this call gets a deal does not take it out of my

272
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,400
pocket.

273
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:44,680
You got to be, guys, think about this and maybe I should answer the bigger question

274
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,960
which is, is ranking rent saturated?

275
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,480
That's the question that everybody's asked from the beginning.

276
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,760
That's the question that I asked.

277
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,560
Basically, the question is this, guys.

278
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:57,960
The question I was asking when I first got started was, did I miss the opportunity?

279
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,080
Should I have done this five years ago?

280
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,680
The answer is, yeah, of course.

281
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,280
It's like that old saying, when is the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago.

282
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,440
That one's the best time today.

283
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:11,440
Of course, I should have started five years before I even did.

284
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,160
The best time to start is now.

285
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:17,360
If you really think about the amount of businesses out there, if you think about the amount of

286
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:26,240
Let's see how many new businesses start in, let's just say the US and the United States

287
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,080
every year.

288
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,360
There are four points on average.

289
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:36,760
There are 4.7 million businesses started every year.

290
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:43,880
So guys, and that's not even to mention all the new industries that are created.

291
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:49,280
That's not even all like people that are saying this is saturated are looking at this from

292
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,960
one niche and they're looking at it from one angle and they're saying, oh my gosh, everyone's

293
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,560
talking about concrete.

294
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,560
Okay.

295
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,560
Yes.

296
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,840
If you start looking for a concrete website, it is going to be more difficult to find a

297
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:06,280
concrete website that's low hanging fruit than it was four years ago.

298
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,280
Yes.

299
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:12,400
But guys, you're also forgetting the fact that just because you go into a city and you

300
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:17,240
see my website, that doesn't mean you can't come in there as well.

301
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,240
Okay.

302
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,920
There's so many levels to this, but to say that this business is saturated is ridiculous.

303
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,280
It's still unknown.

304
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,280
This business is still unknown.

305
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,400
You still cannot go to somebody and say, hey, I'm in the ranking business and they know

306
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,400
what you're talking about.

307
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,200
They have no idea.

308
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,120
And then once you tell them exactly what it is, they're like, oh, that's super smart.

309
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,480
You're like, yeah, I build these simple websites.

310
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,600
They cost me 80 bucks to build and I rank them and then I rent them out and get paid

311
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,600
passively.

312
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,880
And you're like, yeah, that's genius.

313
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,720
I never hear anything besides that.

314
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,720
That's genius.

315
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,720
Okay.

316
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,080
So it's not saturated.

317
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,080
At least that's my opinion.

318
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,200
And that's the opinion that I've always chosen to follow.

319
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,120
And guys, it's served me very, very well.

320
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,120
Okay.

321
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:03,360
Paul says money and opportunity is limited by the way, Kevin said he updated his location.

322
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,440
Paul says money and opportunity is unlimited.

323
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,080
I'm doing concrete right now and see many opportunities.

324
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,080
Yes.

325
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:17,000
My brother Porter, he started like properly doing this business two years ago.

326
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Yeah.

327
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
About two years ago.

328
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Okay.

329
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,800
That kid has only done concrete.

330
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:26,560
This is like a year, year after we started talking only about concrete.

331
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,760
Everyone is doing concrete.

332
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,300
Everyone's talking about concrete.

333
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,840
He still is getting concrete deals.

334
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,280
He's doing, I think he's does concrete and he does fencing and I think he's going to

335
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,160
that's happened to masonry, okay.

336
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:43,680
But all of his deals at $10,600 per month, all of his deals are in the same niches as

337
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,680
everybody else's in.

338
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,440
So don't, don't stress on that.

339
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,440
Okay.

340
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:53,440
Let me give you guys, I want to share something with you guys that I actually found out or

341
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,400
that I, that I've been trying.

342
00:19:55,400 --> 00:20:03,400
So Francesca and I, if you didn't, if you're not following on YouTube, then that's fine.

343
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,000
But you should because we're sharing a lot of stuff this year that's more of like stuff

344
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
that we're doing.

345
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Okay.

346
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,920
And Francesca and I, as I've mentioned, our goal is to get to $10,000 per month with the

347
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,560
agency of new business in the, in the first quarter.

348
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,560
Okay.

349
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,680
And when I say we, that means her, I'm not doing it.

350
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,800
I'm not doing sales calls.

351
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,800
I'm not doing anything.

352
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,800
I'm just advising.

353
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,800
I talked to her on Mondays.

354
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,800
I talked to her on Wednesdays.

355
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,560
I talked to her on Fridays about the business.

356
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,560
That's it.

357
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,560
Okay.

358
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,560
30 minutes each.

359
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,560
Sometimes it goes a little bit longer, sometimes a little bit shorter.

360
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,720
I'm talking to her total about an hour to an hour and a half is what I'm advising her

361
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,120
on how to run the agency.

362
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,120
So we started looking at our goals.

363
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,360
We reviewed our goals.

364
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,360
Okay.

365
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:46,240
And our, I was like, yeah, our goal is $10,000 per month by the end of quarter one.

366
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,560
So this is about a week and a half ago.

367
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,760
I'm like, Hey, what are we at?

368
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,600
And she's like, we haven't gotten any deals yet.

369
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,360
Now granted, I didn't set these goals until the beginning of February.

370
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,840
So this is like two, three weeks into this, maybe even two weeks.

371
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,840
And so we sat down.

372
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:05,720
We had this whiteboard session in my office and just kind of strategize on what we can

373
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,720
do to make sure that we get to 10 K.

374
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,920
And we realized that if we're going to get to 10 K of not per month, because we're, we're

375
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:19,240
way past 10 K per month, 10 K in new business in quarter one, then we're going to have to

376
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:23,760
do some stuff that's scrappy, some stuff that's unconventional, some stuff that's not exactly

377
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,480
the stuff that I'd be doing longterm.

378
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,480
And so we had three columns.

379
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,520
We had short term, medium term, long term was like, what can we actually do to hit the

380
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,520
10 K?

381
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,520
Okay.

382
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,520
This was the conversation that we had.

383
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:41,960
And we started coming up with ideas and, and a lot of those ideas guys were things that

384
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,160
were not super scalable.

385
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:48,120
They're not things that are something that you could do over and over and over again,

386
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,560
but they are hustle things.

387
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,560
Okay.

388
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:57,480
One of the things that we did is we went and went, and this is the one strategy I want

389
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:04,840
to give you guys is we went in and I have a, so if you either, either if you have websites

390
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:09,400
that are generating a few leads that you want to sell, or if you've looked at a city and

391
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,320
niche and it looks like a really good opportunity, you've done the due diligence, here's a little

392
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,200
strategy that you may want to try.

393
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,200
Okay.

394
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:24,240
Is I went in with my profile and I went in and I found some strategic Facebook groups

395
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,720
in inside, in Facebook.

396
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,720
Okay.

397
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,320
It's one of the Facebook groups and I went into these, these groups.

398
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,040
One of them was a biz buy sell.

399
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,040
Okay.

400
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:37,640
And so whatever the city is, so let's say you're going into Roswell, New Mexico.

401
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,640
Okay.

402
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:44,560
You go to Roswell biz buy sell, you go to Roswell yard sale, online yard sale, whatever

403
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:49,240
you go to these groups and you go and join these groups in these cities.

404
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,240
Okay.

405
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:57,640
Now, if you haven't made any posts or interactions in there, you may want to do just a few just

406
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,760
to make it look like you're not brand new.

407
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:04,560
But if this is in your hometown, then it makes it a little bit easier because you're probably

408
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,840
going to have some mutual contact.

409
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,680
So you're not going to look like you're a scam.

410
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:13,320
So we went into these groups and we just wrote up this simple copy.

411
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,000
And we made a quick post.

412
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
It wasn't big.

413
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
It wasn't long.

414
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,160
It didn't seem salesy.

415
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,760
And it basically said something like this.

416
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:26,160
It said, it said, Hey, does here, I'll actually read the text for you guys and I'll copy the

417
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,160
post for you guys.

418
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,440
And I'll, I'll drop it real quick.

419
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,440
Hold on.

420
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,880
Let me go and find the post real quick because we've already had some hits on this thing.

421
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,800
And I think we're going to be able to, to have some sales calls based on this real quick.

422
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:41,080
Let me just pull this up loading here.

423
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,080
There it is.

424
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,080
I put this on last night.

425
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,080
All right.

426
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,720
I'm going to copy this for you guys.

427
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,520
I don't know if this will let me.

428
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,520
All right.

429
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:55,200
I don't know if it'll let me drop it, but here's what it says.

430
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,520
Can anyone recommend a good blank?

431
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,520
Okay.

432
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:03,360
So whatever that is, can anyone recommend a good concrete company, a good fencing company?

433
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,360
So that was it.

434
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,400
Can anyone recommend a good blank?

435
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,160
And then I put space.

436
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:13,640
I put question mark space, preferably someone who is not super booked out, have two referrals

437
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,960
that need work done.

438
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,960
Okay.

439
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,960
Simple little text.

440
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,960
I didn't put in there.

441
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:21,800
I generate leads and I've got a website and I need somebody to work with.

442
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:25,440
I just put, can anyone recommend a good blank?

443
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,440
Preferably someone who is not super booked out, have two referrals that need work done.

444
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,440
Okay.

445
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,200
I've already got eight comments on this thing.

446
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,360
Um, somebody, somebody said, uh, they tagged somebody else.

447
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,600
Hey, does Kenny have time?

448
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,720
There's a referral.

449
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:40,560
And by the way, this is somebody who's like not even advertising online.

450
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,360
So I don't know if it's going to be the greatest.

451
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,000
Then somebody else says, uh, do you have an excavator?

452
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,440
And by the way, the niches excavation, do you have an excavator?

453
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,400
Is this a full-time thing or a quick project?

454
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,400
Probably not somebody I'm going to reach out to.

455
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:55,760
Then I have somebody that, that reaches out and says this, he says, we, and this guy actually

456
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,880
knows who I am.

457
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,960
He goes, we could do trade.

458
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,440
I need help with my websites and I want, I want to build two more.

459
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,480
So I don't know what this guy's referring to.

460
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:12,080
If he, so if he's got, uh, you know, he does the comment before says he has an excavator.

461
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,080
Okay.

462
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,920
So now I have somebody I can talk to.

463
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,920
Then I have another one.

464
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:20,720
It guy just barely comment and says, we're at, we do excavation work and he tags his

465
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:25,640
own business, which by the way, I believe is also in the same city.

466
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,640
Okay.

467
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,600
So right there, I just got two people that now reached out to me that want work that

468
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,080
made their comment.

469
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,720
And I have two, two warm prospects to reach out to.

470
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,840
Okay.

471
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:43,200
If I can drop this, um, let's see if I can drop a picture here, where's that?

472
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,200
Hold on.

473
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,200
I don't know if I can file.

474
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,200
Okay.

475
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,840
I'll try to draw what I'll try to do, guys.

476
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,840
I'll try to drop it in the, uh, as a comment or something.

477
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,800
Let me add Carlo into here, by the way.

478
00:25:54,800 --> 00:26:00,120
So anyway, guys, just a super easy, quick strategy that you guys can use to find warm

479
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,120
prospects.

480
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:06,800
It always helps if you're, you know, let's, this would be good guys in the situation where

481
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:10,840
you've tried, you build a list, you tried to cold call, didn't have any luck and you're

482
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:15,000
just looking for more people that would work, um, where you're already getting leads.

483
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,160
It would work in a situation where you already have a website and it's getting a few leads,

484
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,560
but you haven't sold it yet.

485
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:23,720
It could work in a situation where you've just found the city and found the niche and

486
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,600
you're running the ads and you're waiting for the ads to kick in.

487
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:31,080
You could also do that strategy, but guys, it's, it's been like, I made that post

488
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,240
on Friday.

489
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,640
That's all that I did is made that simple little post and we've already gotten two feedback

490
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,640
or two hits.

491
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,640
Okay.

492
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:44,000
So, um, according to this says Paul says we use a very similar strategy and crush it.

493
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
So there you go.

494
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,520
That was just a little, little thing that I tried and it worked really well.

495
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:52,040
We've got a bunch of different things we're going to be trying guys back to the book that

496
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,760
I recommended back to the slide edge.

497
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:58,480
It's all these little things that you're doing, all these little things, these little places

498
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,000
that you're letting people know what you do.

499
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,920
All the, yeah, I know it's not sustainable necessarily to do, uh, a hundred different

500
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:09,640
posts all over the place, but guys, all the little things that you're doing, all the conversations

501
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,520
that you're having, that person that you told that the gym that you do lead generation,

502
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:16,340
the person that you're sitting in the sauna with to ask what you do, um, these things

503
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:20,800
all add up and, uh, yeah, they're there.

504
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:24,580
At some point you start to realize, Hey, that guy I talked to like two months ago, he hit

505
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:27,640
me back up and he's, he's ready to, to work with me.

506
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,640
Okay.

507
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,640
All right, let's keep going.

508
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:37,160
All right, let's see.

509
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,160
Here's another one.

510
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,600
This is not something that's a question, but it kind of is a question.

511
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:46,920
So, uh, somebody said this, I had this, again, I made this video that said how the game has

512
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:52,060
changed and this person made kind of a snarky comment and said, yes, if you constantly focus

513
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:53,060
on SEO.

514
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,060
Okay.

515
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:55,060
And they're making this, this thing.

516
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:57,480
So really the question is like, can you do this business?

517
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,800
I guess the question, if I were to phrase it, would be that they're asking is like,

518
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:07,120
how much SEO, how much ongoing SEO do you need to do on these websites to keep them

519
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,120
ranked?

520
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,120
Okay.

521
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,120
Guys, um, not much.

522
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,920
I'm going to show you a couple of examples here.

523
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,920
Okay.

524
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,920
Here's my YouTube comments.

525
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,920
I'm looking at, by the way.

526
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,920
Okay.

527
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,520
So let's go like this.

528
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:25,360
So I'm going to give you an example of, uh, I love this example because it's such a, such

529
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,960
a great site that I love Bentonville concrete.

530
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,560
You guys have heard me use this example.

531
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:32,320
This is my site right here, Bentonville concrete.com.

532
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,240
You can say, I just want to show you how well it's ranked.

533
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,240
So I'm ranked here.

534
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,240
Let me see if you guys can actually see it.

535
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,240
Zoom in a little bit.

536
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,600
This is my site here, Bentonville concrete.

537
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:44,440
This is my, um, math listing, Bentonville concrete.

538
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:48,740
This is my Facebook page, Bentonville concrete is ranked.

539
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:51,120
So my page is ranked number one.

540
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:57,440
My map is ranked number one and my Facebook page is ranked number two.

541
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,440
Okay.

542
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,440
Keep going.

543
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:04,360
I don't know if I have any more listings on page one, but I, I have two of the top, well

544
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,880
technically in the organic listings.

545
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,880
Let's go like this.

546
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:14,320
Let's change this around a little bit and put concrete contractors Bentonville AR.

547
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,000
Okay.

548
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:23,840
Ranked number two and then I'm ranked number one and I'm ranked number two.

549
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,260
And that's not even my Facebook page either.

550
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:30,200
So I've got the two top spots in the organic and the second spot in the map pack.

551
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:37,380
Why do I tell you this, friends, I have not logged into this website.

552
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,380
God is my witness.

553
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:43,040
I'll, I'll, I'll triple check with Francesca, but God is my witness personally.

554
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,040
I have not logged.

555
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,600
I don't even know how to log into the website.

556
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,240
I'm sure that I have the password saved.

557
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:53,200
It's been two to three years, two to three years since I've logged on the website.

558
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,320
The only thing that we've been doing is the business owner has taken some accountability.

559
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,280
He's helping us to get reviews.

560
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,280
That's it.

561
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,880
We have not logged into the website.

562
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:06,480
In fact, the business owner came to us recently and said to us, Hey, we want, I would love

563
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,320
to add this and that he printed off.

564
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,720
He went and he printed off all the content.

565
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:14,480
He highlighted the stuff that he wanted to remove.

566
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,080
And in fact, I'm going to message him after this because I think I can squeeze in for

567
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,080
another deal.

568
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:24,120
Um, so we were talking about doing something and I'm going to, I'm going to mention this

569
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,120
here in a second.

570
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,240
Anyway, guys, he's like, Hey, can we change this?

571
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,240
Can we change this?

572
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,400
And I told him, I said, look, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.

573
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,400
Okay.

574
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,040
So I'm not touching the site.

575
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,960
This thing is ranking like a champ.

576
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,280
It's glued to the top.

577
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,280
Now, why?

578
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,480
Well, because I did a really good due diligence.

579
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,640
I caught this website.

580
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:49,080
I built this website the perfect time before the, the, well, probably around the same time,

581
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,760
but I knew business was booming.

582
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,760
I used to live in Bentonville.

583
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,520
I used to do door to door sales in Bentonville.

584
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,760
I saw the houses going up.

585
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,880
I saw the economy.

586
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,480
I saw the cars people drove.

587
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:02,120
I knew that Walmart had a policy they were implementing where if you worked, if you sold

588
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:06,280
products to Walmart, you had to have an office in Bentonville, Arkansas.

589
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,280
I knew all these things.

590
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,360
I knew there was also JB Hunt.

591
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,280
I knew Tyson Chicken was there.

592
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:14,880
I had all this Intel because I lived there and I just made this bet.

593
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,920
And I did the research back, guys, back in the day when I built Bentonville concrete,

594
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:21,160
when you looked at the search volume, there was not much.

595
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,560
It was, it was a, it was a risk.

596
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:25,760
I built this thing as a risk and I ranked this website quick.

597
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,200
It was like two, three months because no one was trying to rank.

598
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,200
There was no competition.

599
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,200
Right?

600
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:34,840
So I built this website and it ranks, but because I did such good due diligence, guys,

601
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:37,600
this thing is glued to the top.

602
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:41,240
So the reason I'm telling you this is this person that's like telling me, yeah, unless

603
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:44,560
you focus on SEO, no, you don't have to focus on SEO.

604
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,800
You have to do, do good due diligence.

605
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,480
You have to know what to look for in a city and niche.

606
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,040
And then it's glued to the top and there's not much upkeep.

607
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,040
That's one website.

608
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,040
Okay.

609
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,440
I'll give you one more.

610
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:04,760
This one right here I built in St. George, towing St. George, Utah, okay.

611
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,240
Right here, towingstgeorge.com.

612
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,320
Rank number one, towingstgeorge.com.

613
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,320
Rank number two.

614
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,320
Okay.

615
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:17,840
See another, I, by the way, I tell you this.

616
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,320
I haven't logged into this website.

617
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:23,480
Look at this website guys.

618
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,480
It's hideous.

619
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,560
I haven't logged into this.

620
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:28,000
I think we, we sold this in 2020.

621
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,040
We have not added content.

622
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,100
We have not added backlinks.

623
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,900
We have not done anything in five years.

624
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:35,900
This thing's glued to the top.

625
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,980
It's making us like five, 600 bucks per month.

626
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,940
Not, not anything crazy on autopilot.

627
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:40,940
Okay.

628
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:41,940
I don't even think we run ads.

629
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:42,940
Let me double check here.

630
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:43,940
Let me go back.

631
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:44,940
Maybe we run a little bit.

632
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:45,940
I don't even think we run ads.

633
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:46,940
No, I don't think so.

634
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:49,700
I don't think we run any ads at all.

635
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:50,700
Okay.

636
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:56,220
So anyway, you do not, if the key is not the SEO, the key is doing the, the, the, the due

637
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,220
diligence.

638
00:32:57,220 --> 00:33:01,940
So guys, for those of you that are in digital landlords, go follow the due diligence process

639
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:04,100
to a freaking tee.

640
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:07,160
Everything that I tell you to do, if it says that the CPC needs to be, make sure it says

641
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:10,340
if it says that you need to look for this sign, this sign before you go into it, do

642
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,340
that.

643
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:14,940
If, if this, if I tell you that the search volume needs to be the minimum of this, go

644
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:15,940
and do it.

645
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:20,320
If you do these, even if you got to look at a hundred of these things, guys, it's going

646
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,320
to be worth it.

647
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:24,300
If you don't have to look at a hundred cities and niches to find one, it's going to be worth

648
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,300
it.

649
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,300
Okay.

650
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,300
Because it's going to, you're going to have projects like this.

651
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,960
You're going to build five years later, no upkeep, no nothing.

652
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:33,120
You're making 600 bucks a month and it's still paying you every single month.

653
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,120
Okay.

654
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:37,240
And luckily with rank and rent engine, you guys are not using that.

655
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:41,480
I, you don't have to, but it's made due diligence so freaking fast.

656
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:46,480
You can go bust out 20 due diligence in an hour, maybe a little bit less than that.

657
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,600
And you can go look at 20 cities.

658
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,240
So in one day you could have a VA.

659
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:52,560
Once you train them, you can have a VA look at a hundred cities in a day, right?

660
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:55,320
You look at a hundred cities in a day for five days, you go look at 500 cities, you

661
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,380
find five projects to go into.

662
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,720
You can do some real damage guys.

663
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,560
So anyway, if you aren't using that already, go to the rankandrentengine.com.

664
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:04,280
The due diligence tool is freaking amazing.

665
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,280
Okay.

666
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,280
Let's keep going.

667
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,280
See if anyone has any other questions.

668
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:10,000
We should stop the share here.

669
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,720
All right.

670
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:12,720
Let's see.

671
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:13,720
What else we got?

672
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,720
Let me make a note here.

673
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:24,480
Sometimes I'll be talking and I have thoughts that I want to just make sure I don't forget.

674
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,480
Okay.

675
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,480
What else we got?

676
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:39,880
I'm not sure what that question is.

677
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:44,200
That's in the spam.

678
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,200
What else?

679
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,200
What else?

680
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,200
What else?

681
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,200
Okay.

682
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:52,760
Somebody said, yo, I'm 23 year old Russian American.

683
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:56,600
Let me know if you want to work together.

684
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,920
That's not really a question, but one thing I'll say is that I don't care where you're

685
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,920
at.

686
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,320
You guys can make this strategy work.

687
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:07,040
I just did an interview with a guy named Pierre, Pierre Goddard.

688
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:10,040
Some of you guys might know him from some of the other groups that you guys are in.

689
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,800
This guy is in France.

690
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,800
Sorry.

691
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:17,960
He's from France, French accent, living in Thailand and he's targeting France.

692
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:23,680
He's making a little over $12,000 per month and he's exclusively targeting France.

693
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,680
Okay.

694
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,040
If you're in Russia, you can target Russia.

695
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:29,560
If you're in freaking wherever, you can target wherever.

696
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:33,080
If people search the same way that we do in the U.S., okay.

697
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,580
There's a lot of interesting countries that I'm looking at.

698
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,680
So that's just a quick thought, guys.

699
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:42,960
If you're in a country besides the U.S., you want to target your country, you should, okay.

700
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:43,960
Let's see.

701
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:55,040
Here in terms of questions, I think we pretty much hit it.

702
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:59,160
Somebody right here just dropping three spam comments.

703
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,160
That's good.

704
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:04,760
Okay.

705
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:08,560
Let's go to, yeah, pretty much everything's spam there.

706
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,560
All right.

707
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:13,200
If anyone has, doesn't have questions, I'll keep going.

708
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:20,960
Paul, he says, is there any keyword campaigns available for PPC for concrete?

709
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,440
Quick follow up question to that, Paul, just drop in the comments.

710
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:28,520
Are you talking about like a keyword list or what do you mean by a keyword campaign?

711
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:35,320
If you don't mind, just clarify that really quick while I jump into the Facebook group

712
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:38,720
and answer some questions that people had.

713
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,720
Okay.

714
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:45,840
Let's go here.

715
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:56,240
All right.

716
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,240
I got one right there.

717
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,240
Let me just clarify, Paul.

718
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:03,240
Paul, when you can, just clarify what you're talking about when you say, is there any keywords

719
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,240
campaigns available for PPC?

720
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,240
Okay.

721
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,880
All right.

722
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:12,680
While that's happening, guys, here's a question by Tim Johnson.

723
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:21,120
He says, I've used Pakistan guys for GMB before and had luck on $300 ones, but dude's Facebook

724
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,080
profile disappeared.

725
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:26,480
Anyone have a reliable source for done for you GMBs verified?

726
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:34,920
Guys, I'm not a fan of messing with the GMB, especially with outsourced Pakistanis.

727
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:35,920
Okay.

728
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:42,800
I'm all about doing the GMB the right way, the white hat way, the clean way, using the

729
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,200
business owner.

730
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:50,080
Like for example, we have a business owner here in town and he actually has come to the

731
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:53,920
office with his truck, with his business cards, with his stuff.

732
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:58,120
And we've done a video call with him at the office with Google.

733
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,120
Okay.

734
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,120
I got no problems with that.

735
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,600
I'm not doing fake reviews.

736
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:05,840
I'm not doing Pakistani freaking people, whatever.

737
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:11,240
And by the way, there's no, there's no, like, I'm not talking smack because this is something

738
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,600
that lots of people do.

739
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,600
Lots of people like to do.

740
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:17,120
I'm talking for me personally, guys, I'm trying to build an empire here.

741
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:20,800
I'm trying to build a business that if something happens to me, God forbid, I can leave it

742
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,800
to my kids.

743
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:27,040
I'm trying to build something that I can, I can, that we can have around for years and

744
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,800
years that can continue to produce cash.

745
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,120
And I'm not just going to take shortcuts.

746
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,120
Okay.

747
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,920
I'm going to do it the right way.

748
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:38,120
So I don't do this stuff.

749
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:42,200
So in terms of like do it done for you, GMB, I just don't mess with it.

750
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,200
Okay.

751
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:50,960
There was somebody that did recommend a, somebody that did recommend a source, but the guy that

752
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,320
recommended it, I don't trust greatly.

753
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,240
So I'm not really sure I would recommend that either.

754
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,240
Okay.

755
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:02,920
All right.

756
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:07,480
Paul says, basically any working campaigns that I've been, that have been run for a while

757
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:13,420
and optimized to save my time, Paul, if you want to reach out to Francesca, this is something

758
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:17,800
because you're in digital landlords, I got no problem helping you out extra.

759
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:24,120
If you want to reach out and do this for me, send me and Francesca a Facebook message.

760
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:27,400
Wait until I get off the stream so I can respond, explain what you're looking for.

761
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,940
I'll put a voice note out that says, Hey, here's what he's trying to do.

762
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:34,840
And I'll tell her, you know, sometimes Francesca, she goes, she's like, can you not tell people

763
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,120
about all of our websites?

764
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:39,700
Because she kind of has a little bit of a scarcity mentality sometimes.

765
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,240
And I'm like, no, it doesn't matter.

766
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:46,720
So anyway, she might want to just screenshot it and just send you a certain parts of it.

767
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:52,120
But anyway, Paul, message both of us and we'll try to get you something if possible.

768
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,120
Okay.

769
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,120
Apology.

770
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:59,560
Simon says, apologies, can't see an update to Community World Map.

771
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:06,440
Simon, just grab your, okay, if it's not working, what I would like you to do is once we get

772
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:10,640
off this call, make a quick little loom and show me what you're trying to do.

773
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,200
And I'll try to figure out why it's not working.

774
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:16,640
But you should be able to just grab your username, copy and paste it, plug it in, and you should

775
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,640
be good to go.

776
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,640
Okay.

777
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,640
If not, just send me a loom and I'll look into it.

778
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,640
I'll have Ashley look into it.

779
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,640
Okay.

780
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:26,240
Paul says, there is a lot of scammers out there right now for GMB.

781
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,240
Tread with caution.

782
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,240
Do not pay upfront.

783
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,240
A thousand percent.

784
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,240
GMBs are just spending like crazy.

785
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,240
I lost any properties.

786
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,240
That's why I'm shipping.

787
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,240
Yeah.

788
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,240
That's a great point.

789
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,240
I forgot Paul.

790
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,960
Paul had a huge stake in the GMB stuff and here we are.

791
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,960
So anyway, Paul, great feedback.

792
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:40,960
Crank head to bounce.

793
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,960
Okay.

794
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:42,960
Let me answer like one or two more questions.

795
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,240
But again, Simon send me loom and we will, I'll get it.

796
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,240
I'll check it out.

797
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,240
Okay.

798
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,240
Let's see what else we got here.

799
00:40:50,240 --> 00:41:06,640
I mean, there's not a ton of questions, which is great.

800
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:15,040
Yeah.

801
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,920
Somebody put this, I'll answer this one really quick.

802
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:23,220
Somebody said, does anyone do this under an LLC, blah, blah, blah, blah, okay.

803
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:28,240
Some people want to know if you need to have like an LLC set up for each of these individual

804
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:34,960
properties or maybe let's say you have your, your actual LLC and then you have a DBA, right?

805
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,760
So you have your main company.

806
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:41,260
My company's called Evergreen and then I could go and have my attorney or my accountant set

807
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:46,020
it up and have it like Evergreen leads LLC or I think it's actually called Evergreen

808
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:52,100
Enterprises, the legal name Evergreen, Evergreen leads LLC DBA Bentonville concrete and I could

809
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:58,580
actually go set up a DBA for each one of these websites.

810
00:41:58,580 --> 00:41:59,580
Do you need to do that?

811
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:01,780
I don't think it's necessary.

812
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:02,900
Some people do like to do it.

813
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:08,460
I think sometimes it will help with the GMB and these kinds of things, but I'm asking,

814
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:11,580
I'm saying this because somebody was asking about LLC and I don't know if that's exactly

815
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:14,940
the question they were asking, but you don't have to do this guys.

816
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:19,140
If you're looking to take extra precautions, then I think I went and worked this out with

817
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:22,060
my attorney when I was asking him and he's like, yeah, we can work out a deal where anytime

818
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:24,620
you had a new site, I would just do a DBA for you.

819
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:28,260
It costs you this much money and then it would be checked off and it would be done.

820
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:32,580
So that's something that you could do guys, but again, I think sometimes people overthink

821
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:33,580
this.

822
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:36,180
I've never had to do a DBA on any of my websites.

823
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:40,260
Only thing that I would make sure to put is a privacy policy, put a terms of service page

824
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:42,820
into your website.

825
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:46,460
Other than that, that's really it.

826
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:51,620
The easier thing to do to be cautious is in the bottom of the footer, make some kind of

827
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:59,680
note that says like, this is a third party company that sends business to Joe's concrete

828
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:04,620
and we do not actually do the work, whatever verbiage that sounds better than that.

829
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:09,300
You could actually take their licensing number and paste it in the footer to really save

830
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:11,780
your butt if you're concerned about that.

831
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:13,220
I've never had any issues.

832
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:14,220
I wouldn't worry about that.

833
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:16,740
It's not a huge deal, okay?

834
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:20,900
So that said guys, again, Paul messaged me and Francesca.

835
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:22,700
I'll try to help you out.

836
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:23,940
Simon sent me a loom.

837
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:27,460
I'll also try to look at that as well.

838
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:30,460
And guys, it's February 24th.

839
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:31,460
Let's get at it.

840
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:34,740
This last week that just passed, we got a little tiny deal.

841
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:39,700
You guys probably saw Francesca's post, 300 bucks a month, nothing to write home about,

842
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,700
nothing crazy.

843
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:45,660
300 bucks a month times 12 is $3,600 a year.

844
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:47,780
That ain't something I'm going to turn away.

845
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:48,780
And guess what?

846
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:51,380
Every single one of those $300 adds up.

847
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:53,860
$300 here, by the way, that's pure profit.

848
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:58,380
That's pure profit because that's a website that we had a client for, we lost a client

849
00:43:58,380 --> 00:43:59,380
for.

850
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:00,740
It never was ranking super well.

851
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:01,740
We haven't really focused on it.

852
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:03,100
It was just generating a few leads.

853
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:06,620
So now we're making 300 bucks that we weren't making, okay?

854
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:07,620
Every deal counts.

855
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:08,740
Every phone call counts.

856
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:12,180
Everything that you do adds up, okay?

857
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:13,180
Go read the slide edge.

858
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:16,540
Simon, I would highly recommend you read chapter 13 and if you have any questions, reach out

859
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:17,540
to me.

860
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:22,340
But guys, with that said, guys, don't be afraid in my business right now.

861
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:24,580
I'm not afraid to do things that are unscalable.

862
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:26,940
I'm not afraid to reach out to somebody.

863
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:29,840
Like for example, I'll give you one last thing as I go.

864
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:35,300
We had this person that we got on the phone with on a sales call on Saturday, okay?

865
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:37,780
And yes, we run Saturday calls because why not?

866
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:41,660
Why not start the day, why not start the weekend with some new money?

867
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:45,140
So we had this guy, we jumped on and we didn't close him.

868
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:46,300
I didn't stay on the whole time.

869
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:49,340
I just jumped off for a second just to make myself known.

870
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:51,340
He didn't close.

871
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:59,380
And after I got his number and I text him and I sent him a few texts, I sent him a two

872
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:03,420
and a half minute voice note and throughout the day yesterday I was texting this guy back

873
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:05,460
and forth, okay?

874
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:08,300
Is this something I could do with every single deal?

875
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:11,860
I have salespeople, that's their job, whatever, whatever, whatever.

876
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:12,860
Should I be doing it?

877
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:14,580
You could argue, no, I shouldn't be doing it.

878
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:16,460
Some people probably would tell me I'm stupid.

879
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:17,580
I am hungry, man.

880
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:18,580
I want the deals.

881
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:19,580
I'm willing to do it.

882
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:23,740
I'm willing on a Sunday to message the guy and just say, hey, I know it's Sunday, I don't

883
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:24,740
work on Sunday.

884
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:29,860
I just want to send you a message and say this, that, and this, that, and the rest.

885
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:32,980
I would love to, whatever, let's talk again on Monday.

886
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:35,460
I've got some ideas and the guy agreed.

887
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:37,580
The guy messaged back, hey, thanks for the text, Nick.

888
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:38,580
I really appreciate it.

889
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:41,940
I could see how much you actually care about your business and I would love to jump back

890
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:46,300
on a Zoom call on Monday and see what you're talking about and we're going to come to this

891
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:50,100
guy with some different options than what we gave him and see if we can close the deal.

892
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:51,140
Is it practical?

893
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:52,660
Is it scalable?

894
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:53,660
Probably not, okay?

895
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:57,660
To do that with every single client, especially as you scale, probably not, but guys, do unscalable

896
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:59,340
things to pick up the momentum.

897
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:00,620
You guys just got to get that first deal.

898
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:01,620
You got to get that second deal.

899
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:04,820
If it's been a while since you got a deal, go do whatever you got to do to get that deal.

900
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:07,940
Go make the Facebook post that's going to get you that inbound warm lead.

901
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:11,340
Be willing to go grab lunch with somebody, again, not every time.

902
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:16,300
It shouldn't be part of your ongoing process, but guys, be willing to do unconventional,

903
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:19,060
unscalable things to scale, okay?

904
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:20,060
That's how you scale.

905
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:22,460
That's how you pick up momentum is you do those things, those hustle deals.

906
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:25,420
Guys, 2025, that's what I'm all about, is getting those hustle deals and getting back

907
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:30,380
to the freaking, the nitty gritty basics and I hope you guys will too.

908
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:31,380
So guys, appreciate you being on this call.

909
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:35,420
I'm going to upload this, the replay, here in the next few minutes and I will see you

910
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:36,420
guys next week.

911
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:38,980
Guys, bring your questions, anything at all that you've got.

912
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:46,180
Maybe next week we'll have a topic specific Q&A and we will see you guys in a week.

913
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:46,740
Thanks, guys.
