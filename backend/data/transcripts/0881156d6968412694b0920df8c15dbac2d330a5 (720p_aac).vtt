I got three things. You got content, we got backlinks, and we have age of domain.

00:04.720 --> 00:07.400
We're going to show you how to find all those things, how to assess all those things,

00:07.400 --> 00:09.880
how to audit all those things, how to do all those things.

00:09.880 --> 00:13.120
Those are the things that's the 80-20 principle.

00:13.120 --> 00:17.120
That's the 20 percent of things that give you 80 percent of the results.

00:17.120 --> 00:20.280
So all these other things that we're going to teach you, they do matter.

00:20.280 --> 00:21.440
OK, and we're going to do them.

00:21.440 --> 00:23.360
We're going to make sure we do them correctly.

00:23.360 --> 00:27.920
But remember, fundamentally, if we can do those things better than everybody else

00:27.960 --> 00:30.640
that we can control, because we can't control the age,

00:30.640 --> 00:34.960
we can do those other two better than everybody else, we will win the game.

00:34.960 --> 00:39.920
And especially if we're going against competition, that is not that great.
