00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,040
After you've hooked the business owner, you're going to send the leads.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,640
You got leads coming in, you hook the business owner, you got to send them a couple leads.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:13,320
Here's my tip, never send more than five leads, but as soon as they close one, go for the

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,320
close.

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,360
You send them one lead, they go and run it that night, they close it, go for the close.

6
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,560
Get on a Zoom call, go close it, go for the close.

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:27,960
Now at the same time, do not feel that or think that the business owner has to make

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,080
money before you can go for the close because they don't.

9
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,980
And I've got tons and tons of different examples where I have sent two, three leads, the business

10
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:40,960
owner scheduled one for tomorrow, one for Friday, one for next week, and I just feel

11
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,960
like it's time to go and I've gone and closed the deal tomorrow morning.

12
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,020
They don't even run the leads, much less close the leads.

13
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:49,840
So don't think that they need to make money at all.

14
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,280
Now if they make money, even better, but if you don't, you don't have to send them leads

15
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,200
until they make money.

16
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:00,240
You just need to send them leads so they can see the quality and the style and how you

17
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:05,680
operate and what it's going to be like working with you and make sure it's a great experience.
