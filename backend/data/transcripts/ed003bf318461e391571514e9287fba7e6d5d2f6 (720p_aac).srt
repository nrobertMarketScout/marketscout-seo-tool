1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
What parts of the closing script would you say are the most important to emphasize?

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:08,480
Most important thing with the closing script, Porter, you got to get in and you got to figure

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,640
out what drives them. You got to get in and you got to figure out at the very beginning,

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:16,880
why are they doing the business? Because at the end of this, the end of the call,

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,840
when they start to waft and they start to shake and they start to, let me call you back,

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,240
or I don't know if it's worth it, you can go back to the thing that they said at the beginning

7
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:31,840
and you can hit back on that. I remember a couple months ago, I had somebody I was talking to

8
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:38,240
and we dug in, we dug in, we dug in and I found out pretty early on that they were like,

9
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:47,120
I want to blow up my business because, and this is a real story, because I'm so tired of my sister

10
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,080
not believing in me and every time I go home, she's talking crap about me and saying I'm not

11
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:57,360
going to make it and I'm on to the next thing and I'm so tired of that and I was able to find that

12
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,560
up front and at the end when there was like, oh, I don't know if this is worth it, whatever,

13
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:10,480
I reminded this person, I said, dude, how many more family dinners are you going to go to

14
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:16,800
and have your sister laugh at you? How many more family dinners are you going to go to or Christmas

15
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:21,280
get togethers you're going to go to where you're the laughing stock of the family, right?

16
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,440
And I knew that's what drove that person and I was able to hit on that and at the end,

17
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:32,080
and it was like, yeah, you're right, let's do this, let's freaking do this. So the most important part

18
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:37,440
of the entire script is figuring out what drives them, period, right? Because if you've done the

19
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:42,000
lead part correctly and sent the leads, you've done most of the selling already. If you've overcome

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,520
the objections beforehand like you should have, I mean, that is most important is figure out what

21
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,680
drives them, figure out why they're in business and then you can always at the end, that can be

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,080
your thing that you use to close. And guys, do not hop off the phone with a maybe. Somebody

23
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:02,960
tells you they'll call you back, say, hey, sir, ma'am, I appreciate you, but if it's a maybe,

24
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,120
that's a no for me, okay? I need somebody now. I need somebody that can commit and if this isn't

25
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:11,520
100%, after I've sent you three to five leads, after you've made money on my lead, if that's the

26
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,120
case, after I've shown you that I'm going to give you these exclusively, I've shown you how I got

27
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,440
the lead, we've spent a couple hours on the phone. If this still is a no-brainer and look at the

28
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,400
numbers that we talked about on the lead value calculator, if it's still not a no-brainer, it's

29
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,520
a no. Because what you're telling me is you are not confident in your ability to close and that is

30
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,840
not somebody I can work with. So if this makes sense, which I think it does and you know it does,

31
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,640
let's do this right now. If it doesn't, then let's know, but I don't do call me back later,

32
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:42,400
shit. That's not how we roll. You want to do that with the Dish Network guy, that's fine.

33
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,720
The carpet cleaner guy, that's fine. I work with one company and of course, this is going to be

34
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:52,320
in your own tone. This isn't the douchebag Nick Wood way that he does it. I don't do maybes,

35
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:58,400
okay? A maybe is a no. It's either yes or no. It's not yes or maybe or no. It's yes and everything

36
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,120
else is a no.
