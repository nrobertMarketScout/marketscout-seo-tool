WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.160
All right, boom, recording, Porter, you can hear me.

00:05.160 --> 00:11.200
I see Porter, I'm afraid Nils was on, Moza was on, I don't know who else is on.

00:11.200 --> 00:16.800
Guys, my name is Nick, this is Porter, we're brothers, and I'm just going to share a couple

00:16.800 --> 00:17.800
things really quick.

00:17.800 --> 00:23.960
If you can hear me, let me know, if I'm choppy, Moza can hear me all the way from South Africa,

00:23.960 --> 00:26.440
so that means that it's working, okay?

00:26.440 --> 00:32.440
So we're going to do this in 20 minutes or less, maybe 15.

00:32.440 --> 00:37.800
What I want to talk about today, I want to, I think I titled this, how to make money building

00:37.800 --> 00:42.600
simple websites with zero technical knowledge, okay?

00:42.600 --> 00:48.600
The reason why I want to do this and go live, number one is because I've realized that no

00:48.600 --> 00:52.360
matter how much you talk about what you do, you're going to get sick of talking about

00:52.360 --> 00:53.720
it before people even know what you do.

00:53.800 --> 01:00.680
I talk to people all the time, they're on my Facebook, they're, I think, maybe they

01:00.680 --> 01:02.040
can't stop unfriending me.

01:02.040 --> 01:04.920
I always think they're on my Facebook, they're like, so what do you do for work?

01:04.920 --> 01:07.960
And I'm like, dude, I literally post about it every day and it's really annoying for

01:07.960 --> 01:10.840
me, I can't imagine how annoying it is for everybody else.

01:10.840 --> 01:17.160
So in an effort to let everybody know what it is I do, number one, number two, is I've

01:17.160 --> 01:21.800
realized that when you start a business, when you start doing something that no one knows

01:21.800 --> 01:26.600
about or that's new, there's kind of like four stages that you go through.

01:26.600 --> 01:28.840
And here's the four stages that I went through.

01:28.840 --> 01:32.360
Number one is it was like, I told everyone, hey, I'm going to start doing this thing where

01:32.360 --> 01:35.480
I'm going to start renting these websites and building these websites.

01:35.480 --> 01:38.440
It's kind of like real estate, but it's on which websites.

01:38.440 --> 01:39.720
And I was like really excited.

01:39.720 --> 01:41.320
And then people would just like crap on me.

01:41.320 --> 01:42.760
They're like, oh, that's cool, bro.

01:42.760 --> 01:46.840
But like, is that like, is that a viable business?

01:46.840 --> 01:47.640
You know what I mean?

01:47.640 --> 01:49.400
Like, is that really a way to make money?

01:49.400 --> 01:54.680
I remember specifically somebody said that to me and really just pissed me off when I

01:54.680 --> 01:58.120
was like, dude, I really, you just gave me motivation.

01:58.840 --> 02:00.520
So that's kind of the first stage that you go through.

02:00.520 --> 02:04.040
Then it was like, you start making money and people that they're like, well, he's either

02:04.040 --> 02:10.280
lying or maybe he's making money, but it's because of these reasons that make it so that

02:10.280 --> 02:13.000
he's a, he's an anomaly and no one else could do it.

02:13.000 --> 02:13.960
It's just him, right?

02:14.760 --> 02:19.960
Then what happens is you start to teach or have other people that you know, do it like

02:19.960 --> 02:21.400
you Porter Porter started doing this.

02:21.400 --> 02:22.840
He's making 10 K a month.

02:22.840 --> 02:24.200
Our other brother, Zach started doing this.

02:24.200 --> 02:27.480
He got up to three K a month before he got distracted.

02:28.680 --> 02:29.800
I've had friends do it.

02:29.800 --> 02:31.800
I've had all kinds of different stuff.

02:32.600 --> 02:35.640
And then what happens is people like, all right, I'm going to start paying a little

02:35.640 --> 02:36.600
bit more attention.

02:36.600 --> 02:37.240
Right.

02:37.240 --> 02:41.080
And then the fourth stage, which is what we're finally at, is that people look at it

02:41.080 --> 02:43.720
and they're like, all right, it's legitimate.

02:44.600 --> 02:48.760
If it weren't, then his brother and his friends wouldn't be doing it and talk about

02:48.760 --> 02:49.240
it as well.

02:49.800 --> 02:53.480
And I'm also sick of what I'm doing as a job or as a 95.

02:53.480 --> 02:54.760
So let me check this thing out.

02:54.760 --> 02:56.920
And so, and how can I learn?

02:56.920 --> 02:57.960
That's kind of the stage.

02:57.960 --> 03:00.200
Finally, I've been doing this for nine years.

03:00.200 --> 03:02.200
That's finally where I've gotten to.

03:03.080 --> 03:04.840
And so that's a little bit more fun to talk about.

03:04.840 --> 03:10.040
But guys, no matter what stage you're at of this, I think you're going to find this

03:10.040 --> 03:10.600
interesting.

03:10.600 --> 03:14.920
And so just to kind of give you a little bit of background, I've worked with single moms,

03:14.920 --> 03:15.640
single dads.

03:15.640 --> 03:17.480
I've worked with millionaire business owners.

03:17.480 --> 03:19.480
I've worked with real estate investors.

03:19.480 --> 03:20.680
I work with doctors.

03:20.680 --> 03:25.560
I've worked with like professional lawyers, college students, broke college students,

03:26.440 --> 03:30.200
corporate American, nine to five people climbing the ladder and everything in between.

03:30.200 --> 03:35.400
And one of those people that I've worked with or that I've like brought into this is

03:35.400 --> 03:38.120
Porter, who like I told you, is my little brother.

03:38.200 --> 03:43.800
And I wanted to specifically bring Porter on because not when Porter started doing this,

03:43.800 --> 03:44.920
which was what, two years ago?

03:46.440 --> 03:48.280
Yeah, like two years ago.

03:48.840 --> 03:56.280
Not only did he had no sales experience, but he also had like negative tech experience.

03:56.280 --> 03:58.440
Like that's right around two years ago.

03:58.440 --> 04:01.000
It's right around the time you got your first like smartphone, right?

04:02.120 --> 04:03.880
Basically, yeah, legit.

04:03.880 --> 04:07.560
Yeah, between the two of us, not really.

04:08.760 --> 04:13.880
I'm not saying that we have a combined ACT score that we're going to put on our Facebook page.

04:14.760 --> 04:16.440
We're not technical people.

04:16.440 --> 04:16.760
Okay.

04:16.760 --> 04:20.920
And so whenever you bring somebody like me or Porter, it's like, all right, these guys

04:20.920 --> 04:22.360
are just simple people.

04:22.360 --> 04:23.720
If they can do it, I can do it.

04:23.720 --> 04:28.760
So now guys, Porter, two years later, he makes $10,000 per month of renting these simple

04:28.760 --> 04:29.160
websites.

04:29.160 --> 04:30.440
We're going to show you one of these websites.

04:30.440 --> 04:32.520
In fact, maybe I'll do that first.

04:33.240 --> 04:34.520
But basically, I brought Porter on.

04:34.520 --> 04:39.640
I want to just like have him share his experience, having no experience, no technical experience,

04:39.640 --> 04:42.280
how he's been able to do it, ask him a few questions.

04:42.280 --> 04:46.440
And then also one thing you should know, I'm going to show you guys an example,

04:46.440 --> 04:48.840
is Porter doesn't do this full-time.

04:48.840 --> 04:51.480
This is something that he does kind of on the side.

04:51.480 --> 04:54.280
He works on the family farm.

04:54.280 --> 04:55.320
He's taken over the family farm.

04:55.320 --> 04:56.280
That's his main priority.

04:56.280 --> 05:00.680
So this is like a part-time thing for him and which I think is very interesting to note

05:00.680 --> 05:02.840
because he's not doing this full-time.

05:02.840 --> 05:07.400
So a lot of you guys might be watching this and you have full-time jobs, which I know

05:07.400 --> 05:12.120
you do because you're on this YouTube live right now, which means you're trying to escape

05:12.120 --> 05:14.360
work and you're getting paid to do it.

05:14.360 --> 05:16.200
But anyway, let me show you a quick example.

05:16.200 --> 05:18.680
And then Porter, I'm going to pepper you with some questions.

05:19.640 --> 05:25.400
Also on that note, Porter, as he's built this $10,000 per month business, he's also

05:25.400 --> 05:26.360
got married.

05:26.360 --> 05:28.520
He has a baby, how old is your baby, four months?

05:29.480 --> 05:30.600
Four months old.

05:30.600 --> 05:31.320
Amazing, dude.

05:31.320 --> 05:35.480
So for those of you that are like, I have kids and I don't have time, whatever your

05:35.480 --> 05:38.120
excuse is, you do have time, okay?

05:38.120 --> 05:40.360
Okay, Porter, can you see my screen?

05:41.240 --> 05:42.440
Yeah, I can see it.

05:42.440 --> 05:44.280
I'm going to give you just a quick example.

05:44.280 --> 05:45.000
This is what we do.

05:46.520 --> 05:48.120
Basically, we build simple websites.

05:48.120 --> 05:49.880
We get them to the top of Google.

05:49.880 --> 05:52.040
And then when people call those websites, we get paid.

05:53.480 --> 05:54.440
Very simple.

05:54.440 --> 05:59.720
We build, rent, and rank simple websites, simple web assets.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.280
We're website rental people.

06:02.280 --> 06:03.320
We're middlemen.

06:03.320 --> 06:04.360
We're whatever.

06:05.160 --> 06:09.720
Basically, we're putting a customer and a business owner together using a website.

06:09.720 --> 06:13.480
And you're going to see here in a second, we're anything but web designers, okay?

06:13.480 --> 06:17.640
So I'm going to show you one of my ugliest websites I've ever produced my entire life.

06:18.440 --> 06:23.240
If you type in tow truck St. George, Utah, towing St. George, Utah,

06:25.240 --> 06:27.960
all the stuff around towing, you're going to go here.

06:27.960 --> 06:30.680
And this very first listing here says towing St. George.

06:31.640 --> 06:36.440
If you click on this, you're going to come across an absolute banger of a website, okay?

06:37.160 --> 06:40.920
As you can see, this is a template that I use from a platform called Weebly.

06:40.920 --> 06:45.400
And I know there's people on there right now that are probably like, oh my gosh,

06:46.440 --> 06:48.040
how are you even making money on this?

06:48.680 --> 06:49.400
That's the point.

06:49.400 --> 06:50.920
I'm going to talk about that in a second.

06:50.920 --> 06:53.480
By the way, Kevin Saba, my friend from Sierra Leone.

06:53.480 --> 06:53.960
What's up, bro?

06:53.960 --> 06:55.000
Is this come to crypto?

06:56.120 --> 06:59.800
Kevin, I'm going to let you keep crypto because I'm Mr. Shiny Object.

06:59.800 --> 07:03.800
If I get into crypto, then I'm going to go down the rabbit hole, not make any money.

07:03.800 --> 07:05.160
And I'm eventually going to come back here.

07:05.160 --> 07:10.120
So for now, I'm sticking with tried and true steady eddy.

07:10.120 --> 07:13.400
You guys can keep all the money on the Trump and the Melania coin.

07:13.400 --> 07:15.400
But when I come back to Sierra Leone, I do want to talk to you.

07:16.360 --> 07:18.520
So this website right here, basically how it works.

07:19.480 --> 07:21.960
If Porter gets, let's just actually use a different example.

07:21.960 --> 07:22.680
Kevin Sessions.

07:22.680 --> 07:23.480
What's up, dude?

07:23.480 --> 07:30.040
Kevin Sessions from Cedar City driving to Vegas breaks down in St. George last exit.

07:30.040 --> 07:30.920
He goes online.

07:30.920 --> 07:32.840
He types in tow truck near me.

07:32.840 --> 07:33.960
He comes to my website.

07:33.960 --> 07:35.320
He calls this number.

07:35.320 --> 07:37.000
I get paid, right?

07:37.560 --> 07:38.040
That's it.

07:38.040 --> 07:39.160
That's the whole model.

07:39.160 --> 07:43.960
Now, just you guys have a little bit of context because I was curious exactly how much

07:43.960 --> 07:45.800
we're making from this website.

07:45.800 --> 07:50.520
I'm going to tell you the exact number that we're making per month and the exact amount

07:50.520 --> 07:52.920
of money that we've made all time on this little website.

07:54.200 --> 08:00.360
So I am making right now gross $500 per month.

08:01.240 --> 08:03.880
I know it doesn't sound like a lot, but $500 per month.

08:04.600 --> 08:09.000
And I have all time on this little website, which I think we built in 2019.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.760
End of 2019, we've made $25,175.

08:14.120 --> 08:15.640
Not bad for this.

08:15.880 --> 08:16.200
Right?

08:16.920 --> 08:22.680
To put it in context, okay, the last real estate property that I bought.

08:22.680 --> 08:25.640
And when I say the last, I don't have hundreds of properties, I have four.

08:25.640 --> 08:28.760
So let me not make this sound like I have like a bunch of property.

08:28.760 --> 08:33.320
But the last one I bought, it was $415,000, 20% down.

08:33.320 --> 08:35.320
So I put $80,000 into it.

08:37.480 --> 08:41.640
I don't rent it out because there is a long story.

08:41.640 --> 08:42.840
I don't rent it out to anyone.

08:42.840 --> 08:43.800
I just have it.

08:43.960 --> 08:45.640
But I priced it out.

08:45.640 --> 08:49.720
If I were to rent it out, the most amount of money I'm going to make on that is like,

08:49.720 --> 08:52.440
if I'm lucky, $150 a month, right?

08:52.440 --> 08:58.280
So I'm making three times more on this stupid little website than I am on a property that

08:58.280 --> 09:05.400
I put $80,000 into and I pay HOA and I'm legally liable for all this different stuff.

09:05.400 --> 09:06.360
I have to pay the note.

09:06.360 --> 09:09.160
I'm on the hook for this website right here.

09:09.160 --> 09:11.480
Cost me $80 to build.

09:12.200 --> 09:14.200
$80, not $70, not $90, $80.

09:14.200 --> 09:18.680
And by the way, I did a breakdown of it.

09:18.680 --> 09:21.720
You can go to Spotify and type in digital real estate secrets.

09:21.720 --> 09:22.520
You guys can check it out.

09:22.520 --> 09:24.360
I broke down how much it would cost to build it.

09:24.360 --> 09:25.880
$80 to build this.

09:25.880 --> 09:27.960
Sweat equity probably 40 to 60 hours.

09:27.960 --> 09:29.800
That's maybe $25,000.

09:29.800 --> 09:31.400
And it's just on Senate and forget it.

09:31.400 --> 09:34.920
So this thing, while I'm talking right now, this is bringing in phone calls.

09:34.920 --> 09:37.800
While I'm sleeping, while I'm traveling, this is bringing in phone calls.

09:37.880 --> 09:43.160
So the game is what we in Porter do is we just go and find cities and niches

09:44.200 --> 09:47.400
where we can build these little websites, rank them really quickly,

09:47.400 --> 09:50.120
find business owners that want these jobs.

09:50.120 --> 09:53.800
And then we just forward the calls to the business owner and we get paid.

09:53.800 --> 09:54.520
Okay.

09:54.520 --> 09:55.880
So that's the model.

09:57.320 --> 09:58.520
Did I miss anything, Porter?

09:59.880 --> 10:01.320
No, that's perfect.

10:02.360 --> 10:03.560
So I want to ask you some questions.

10:03.560 --> 10:06.440
And by the way, anyone else that's on this call right now,

10:06.440 --> 10:10.600
we've got Abu Bakar Ba, I'm guessing from Sierra Leone.

10:10.600 --> 10:11.560
What's up, brother?

10:11.560 --> 10:12.360
Zane Wilson.

10:12.360 --> 10:12.840
What's going on?

10:12.840 --> 10:14.520
Hope the moves going well, dude.

10:14.520 --> 10:18.520
Tong Yang, Peter Bassi from Sierra Leone, Nick Maxwell.

10:18.520 --> 10:20.360
If you guys have questions for Porter, great.

10:20.360 --> 10:23.160
If not, you guys can just enjoy what he's about to say.

10:23.160 --> 10:24.360
I've got some quick questions for you.

10:25.480 --> 10:27.400
All honest, straight up.

10:27.400 --> 10:28.680
Give me your real answers.

10:28.680 --> 10:29.880
No sugar coating, no fluff.

10:29.880 --> 10:30.380
Okay.

10:31.020 --> 10:32.540
Sure.

10:33.900 --> 10:37.500
Can you confirm how much you're making?

10:37.500 --> 10:42.380
And can you also let people know that I have never helped you on any deal?

10:42.380 --> 10:45.580
And by the way, Simon says hi, Nick and Kyle.

10:45.580 --> 10:46.460
This is not Kyle.

10:46.460 --> 10:48.220
Kyle's about twice as tall as this guy.

10:49.020 --> 10:50.620
And he's like twice his age.

10:50.620 --> 10:52.140
But this is Porter, my little brother.

10:52.140 --> 10:53.580
They're nice to see you on, Simon.

10:53.580 --> 10:54.860
Porter, how much you make it?

10:54.860 --> 10:57.980
And sorry, how much you make it?

10:57.980 --> 10:59.660
And can you confirm that you're doing this part time?

10:59.660 --> 11:01.100
Just so that we were like on the same page.

11:02.380 --> 11:02.540
Yeah.

11:02.540 --> 11:04.860
So I'm making a little over 10K per month.

11:04.860 --> 11:05.500
And what?

11:05.500 --> 11:08.380
Give us an exact figure so people don't think that you're wrong, bro.

11:09.900 --> 11:11.260
Sorry, say that you cut out like what?

11:11.260 --> 11:11.980
What's your exact number?

11:11.980 --> 11:12.620
Is it 10 and four?

11:12.620 --> 11:13.660
Was that what it was?

11:13.660 --> 11:16.140
It's 107, 10,000, 700.

11:16.140 --> 11:17.340
10,700.

11:17.340 --> 11:18.140
Okay.

11:18.140 --> 11:20.300
And you're doing this part time, correct?

11:21.100 --> 11:21.580
Yes.

11:21.580 --> 11:22.460
Doing this part time.

11:22.460 --> 11:26.940
And you, it's honestly, I was kind of mad at first because like, bro, you know exactly

11:26.940 --> 11:28.060
how to do this business model.

11:28.220 --> 11:31.820
Why don't you just like share these little secrets or like give me a little referral

11:31.820 --> 11:33.260
on a few of these business owners?

11:33.260 --> 11:38.140
But it's been so much more, it's been way more fulfilling to do it myself because I

11:38.140 --> 11:42.140
actually am like so bought into it now because it took me as long as it did.

11:42.140 --> 11:45.340
And I don't feel like I would have appreciated it as much if you would have helped me.

11:45.340 --> 11:47.820
So yeah, I've given him no referrals.

11:48.540 --> 11:51.340
In fact, I probably answer his calls less than anybody.

11:51.340 --> 11:54.700
I've closed none of his deals, nothing, like zero.

11:54.700 --> 11:55.500
Okay.

11:55.500 --> 11:58.860
So for those of you that are like, oh, big brother, no, didn't do that at all.

11:58.860 --> 11:59.100
Okay.

11:59.100 --> 12:01.740
And I will do that for you, but I'll make you pay me for it, right?

12:01.740 --> 12:02.540
I'm sure you know that.

12:04.780 --> 12:05.420
Okay.

12:05.420 --> 12:09.020
Next one I've got is honest, honest, honest.

12:09.020 --> 12:13.820
When you, because Porter, when I first started doing this, for real, Porter was on his

12:13.820 --> 12:15.340
mission in Colorado.

12:16.060 --> 12:17.180
He got back.

12:17.180 --> 12:18.700
He knew what kind of what I was doing.

12:18.700 --> 12:22.300
Truth be told, did you think that this was a bag of crap, what I was doing?

12:22.300 --> 12:23.660
Or did you think it was legit?

12:23.660 --> 12:25.260
Or would you just like, you just didn't know?

12:25.500 --> 12:28.300
I honestly didn't even know what you did.

12:28.300 --> 12:30.300
Like for the longest time, like it was funny.

12:30.300 --> 12:33.100
I always thought you did something like for only one niche.

12:33.100 --> 12:36.940
Like I knew bits and pieces about kind of what you did, but I had zero interest.

12:36.940 --> 12:38.460
I had zero like, oh, that's cool.

12:38.460 --> 12:40.060
You know, my brother's doing well.

12:40.060 --> 12:43.500
And then I came home and then I was like, dude, life's expensive.

12:43.500 --> 12:45.100
Being married is expensive.

12:45.100 --> 12:47.020
Like I got to start making more money.

12:47.020 --> 12:49.740
And then I was like, Nick, like, what are you actually doing?

12:49.740 --> 12:52.300
And probably like most of you guys, you don't really care until you're like, dude,

12:52.300 --> 12:53.580
like you're, what are you doing?

12:54.140 --> 12:56.620
So that was kind of the interest I would say.

12:56.620 --> 13:00.380
Like when I first like heard about it, it was almost like too good to be true.

13:00.380 --> 13:01.900
I was like, dude, is this actually legit?

13:01.900 --> 13:03.260
Like this seems so fake.

13:03.260 --> 13:08.380
Like how do you have this website and you're making that kind of income per month?

13:08.380 --> 13:10.620
Like that just doesn't make any sense to me.

13:10.620 --> 13:11.180
You know what I'm saying?

13:11.180 --> 13:13.260
Like it doesn't, it just seems too good to be true.

13:13.980 --> 13:15.420
Yeah, no, for sure.

13:15.420 --> 13:18.140
Porter Pelfett thought I was up to some shady stuff.

13:18.140 --> 13:21.180
He's like, there's no way you're making money renting out these simple websites.

13:21.420 --> 13:22.940
Um, okay.

13:22.940 --> 13:24.860
I'm just going to go through these as fast as I can.

13:24.860 --> 13:27.020
Cause I see some questions people have, which we're going to get to.

13:27.020 --> 13:28.060
So Moza, I see you.

13:28.060 --> 13:30.220
I've got a question is I'm going to address her in a second.

13:31.020 --> 13:37.100
Um, truthfully, how has making an extra 10 K per month changed your life?

13:37.100 --> 13:40.780
And I'll mean that in a cheesy way, but I mean like, what is, has it,

13:40.780 --> 13:44.060
has it been like a breath of fresh air to giving you more flexibility?

13:44.060 --> 13:45.660
Has it given you more confidence?

13:45.660 --> 13:46.220
Like what was it?

13:46.220 --> 13:49.500
Has it done for you personally, been able to make an extra $10,000 per month?

13:49.500 --> 13:53.020
Which by the way, for somebody that, how old are you?

13:53.020 --> 13:58.380
23, 24, 24 years old, married kid.

13:59.500 --> 14:05.820
Uh, just 10 K on its own is, I mean, it's not, it's not the end all be all,

14:05.820 --> 14:06.940
but that's not a bad thing.

14:06.940 --> 14:08.140
You didn't go to college.

14:08.140 --> 14:10.620
You don't have a degree, you know?

14:10.620 --> 14:17.020
Um, so that even without the farming stuff, that's, that's not a bad little gig,

14:17.020 --> 14:19.980
but yeah, how's it, what's it done for you and the family and your life?

14:21.260 --> 14:22.300
It's been game changer.

14:22.300 --> 14:26.860
I really, uh, I didn't realize how much I, I, you needed it.

14:26.860 --> 14:28.300
Like I felt like I was like, oh, I could live.

14:28.300 --> 14:31.740
Like when I first moved out, I got an apartment, like half of it went to rent,

14:31.740 --> 14:34.380
half it went to the food of the insurance, the whatever.

14:34.380 --> 14:36.380
And then I was like, dude, life with like a couple hundred bucks.

14:36.380 --> 14:37.980
I'm like, dude, this is not okay.

14:37.980 --> 14:39.100
Like this is stressful.

14:39.100 --> 14:43.260
So to be able to make that kind of money, it takes a little bit off my shoulders to

14:43.260 --> 14:44.860
make me feel like, okay, like this is good.

14:44.860 --> 14:49.500
But also like I've got way more confidence in my ability to be able to make money.

14:49.500 --> 14:55.180
Like I think my biggest thing was again, being in this bubble and not being able

14:55.180 --> 14:58.140
to realize like the kind of money that's actually out there.

14:58.140 --> 15:01.900
Like all you see is what's in front of you until you actually start being around

15:01.900 --> 15:04.060
other people that are making this kind of money.

15:04.060 --> 15:08.140
And it just like made me realize that like, dude, I can do more and I should expect

15:08.140 --> 15:11.180
more out of life than just the use.

15:11.820 --> 15:12.940
Yeah, I like that.

15:13.900 --> 15:16.540
Did you have any experience building websites?

15:18.460 --> 15:21.180
Did you even know how to log on like search?

15:25.260 --> 15:27.020
I had some party on my phone for the longest time.

15:27.020 --> 15:29.340
You gave me crowd for it because Chrome was the way to go.

15:29.340 --> 15:30.940
But no, I had zero tech experience.

15:30.940 --> 15:31.900
Like I didn't even have a lap.

15:31.900 --> 15:36.060
I didn't own a laptop until like two years ago.

15:36.060 --> 15:39.340
Seriously, or like anything like I didn't have anything.

15:39.420 --> 15:41.980
And so I still am like.

15:43.340 --> 15:47.020
I was just going to say this is one that a lot of people, I think they get intimidated.

15:47.020 --> 15:51.260
They're like, yeah, I don't mind talking to people, but I don't know how to build a website.

15:51.260 --> 15:53.260
I don't know how to do this thing called SEO.

15:54.060 --> 15:58.540
I don't know how to any of this technical guys.

15:58.540 --> 16:01.180
This business model isn't near as technical as you might think.

16:01.180 --> 16:05.740
When I started, I actually didn't know what SEO stood for, which you might not either.

16:05.740 --> 16:07.580
It stands for search engine optimization.

16:08.140 --> 16:12.700
I didn't know what a domain was, which by the way, is just the website, the www dot whatever.

16:12.700 --> 16:13.900
That's the domain.

16:13.900 --> 16:15.740
I didn't know any of this stuff.

16:16.860 --> 16:17.580
And here I am.

16:17.580 --> 16:21.500
I'm like, yeah, I'm going to go start renting simple websites, building and renting simple websites.

16:21.500 --> 16:25.500
So now I look back and I can see why people were like, dude, you're crazy because it made no sense.

16:26.140 --> 16:29.740
But neither of us had any technical experience.

16:30.700 --> 16:37.260
So Porter, from somebody really speaking, let's say that they're, I don't know.

16:37.660 --> 16:45.420
40 to 50 years old, never built a website, probably not been at social media,

16:45.420 --> 16:48.300
you know, whatever has to have their wife or husband log in for them.

16:49.740 --> 16:54.220
How realistic is it for them to be able to be, to build one of these like websites

16:54.220 --> 16:56.780
if they've gotten no experience actually like.

16:59.660 --> 17:00.860
I think easy.

17:00.860 --> 17:04.860
I definitely it's literally drag and drop depending on the platform you use.

17:05.660 --> 17:09.100
I mean, you literally could go look at someone's website and say, hey, this looks good.

17:09.100 --> 17:11.740
And then kind of like mimic how it looks or whatever.

17:11.740 --> 17:12.540
But it's so easy.

17:14.140 --> 17:16.300
You really don't need to over complicate it.

17:16.300 --> 17:18.940
It's such a simple process that a lot of us get so scared.

17:19.820 --> 17:21.020
But yeah, you could do that easy.

17:22.460 --> 17:22.960
Okay.

17:25.580 --> 17:26.700
Guys, I second that.

17:28.700 --> 17:32.380
I think if I took my son, he's 11.

17:33.340 --> 17:34.540
Oh yeah, he's going to be 12.

17:35.500 --> 17:39.260
I think without question that I could put him through my training and

17:39.260 --> 17:45.260
he would have a website at the end that would rank like that's how you know.

17:45.260 --> 17:46.940
So anyway, I think you're right.

17:48.540 --> 17:51.020
Did you have doubts about building and renting simple websites

17:51.740 --> 17:54.380
when you started like what or what were your doubts?

17:54.380 --> 17:57.500
Because for me, it makes to me, it makes total sense.

17:57.500 --> 17:59.420
I made I make all my money doing this.

18:00.300 --> 18:01.500
It's provided my lifestyle.

18:01.500 --> 18:03.980
I bought real estate, real estate properties, all this kind of stuff.

18:04.860 --> 18:06.140
That doesn't even cross my mind.

18:06.140 --> 18:09.260
But I think when I started, I looked around.

18:10.540 --> 18:12.300
It's not that I thought people were lying.

18:12.300 --> 18:16.460
I just thought like, maybe everyone else can do it.

18:16.460 --> 18:17.180
I can't.

18:17.180 --> 18:18.540
Did you have any doubts when you started?

18:19.900 --> 18:22.860
Yeah, well, dude, the only job I ever had was working on the farm.

18:22.860 --> 18:25.340
And so to kind of be for you to be able to say,

18:25.340 --> 18:27.740
you could make money on a computer or whatever.

18:27.740 --> 18:29.580
Like you almost just think like, yeah, that's good.

18:29.580 --> 18:33.820
But like not from from from my personality or this type of lifestyle.

18:33.820 --> 18:34.320
Right.

18:34.860 --> 18:37.420
So like when I did it, I was like, it's just it's just too complicated.

18:37.420 --> 18:38.060
It's like I would do it.

18:38.060 --> 18:40.700
But I also was afraid because I was like everything that I

18:40.700 --> 18:42.380
the money that I made, I worked for.

18:42.380 --> 18:44.140
Like I literally physically went and did it.

18:44.140 --> 18:45.660
And then I got paid for it.

18:45.660 --> 18:48.140
And so like to have that that like reincorporating income

18:48.140 --> 18:50.060
was kind of like mind blowing to me.

18:50.060 --> 18:54.140
And also starting out at however old I was and to have that money,

18:54.140 --> 18:55.420
I was scared to like.

18:55.420 --> 18:57.420
And this is like my first venture, you could say.

18:57.420 --> 18:58.140
So maybe someone.

19:00.300 --> 19:04.380
Oh, but for me, that seemed pretty big to be able to spend me.

19:04.380 --> 19:05.980
And then expect to get it back.

19:05.980 --> 19:07.980
Right. Because you don't have much to begin with.

19:07.980 --> 19:10.620
And then to hopefully get it back, like if I make it work.

19:10.620 --> 19:12.460
Right. And that was my I think.

19:12.460 --> 19:14.700
And then finally, when it changed was when I was like, dude,

19:14.700 --> 19:17.580
I'm going to do exactly what everything that you say,

19:17.580 --> 19:19.020
exactly how it's supposed to be done.

19:19.580 --> 19:21.420
And I don't care how long it takes.

19:21.420 --> 19:25.340
And it finally just like every, every, every month or every day I did it,

19:25.340 --> 19:28.460
I got more and more like bought into it.

19:28.460 --> 19:30.220
And it finally just clicked for me.

19:30.220 --> 19:32.460
And I was like, I'm just going to give everything I have.

19:32.780 --> 19:35.420
And you just starts to fall into place.

19:37.500 --> 19:41.980
So Porter, somebody guys that he has a really hard time sitting still.

19:43.500 --> 19:47.020
If we're playing more games as a family, which I do not like to do, by the way.

19:47.020 --> 19:48.620
So it's very rare nowadays.

19:48.620 --> 19:54.860
But back when I used to semi enjoy this, he'll literally in between every turn,

19:54.860 --> 19:55.820
he has to stand up.

19:55.820 --> 19:56.620
He's walking around.

19:56.620 --> 19:57.740
He's on his phone.

19:57.740 --> 19:58.940
He cannot sit still.

19:58.940 --> 20:00.780
So I remember your concern at the beginning was like,

20:00.780 --> 20:03.740
how am I going to sit at a computer and do this?

20:03.740 --> 20:04.940
How have you been able to do this?

20:04.940 --> 20:09.660
I've never even asked you because it's very tough for you to like sit down and do this.

20:09.660 --> 20:14.460
You're more of the go out, be on the tractor, move pipe, do that kind of stuff.

20:14.460 --> 20:16.220
So this wasn't, I know you were worried about that.

20:16.220 --> 20:21.020
How have you been able to, I mean, if you're taking Adderall or something,

20:21.020 --> 20:22.460
you can just go ahead and let us know right now.

20:22.460 --> 20:23.420
But what's the secret?

20:24.780 --> 20:26.460
Oh, dude, I honestly, it's weird.

20:26.460 --> 20:29.340
But I feel like the, by the way, I do better.

20:30.060 --> 20:31.180
I'm not taking Adderall.

20:31.180 --> 20:33.900
If Porter took Adderall, dude, he'd be off the freaking walls.

20:33.900 --> 20:35.020
He needs the opposite of Adderall.

20:35.020 --> 20:35.820
Here you go.

20:35.820 --> 20:36.540
Yeah.

20:36.540 --> 20:43.500
But anyways, I honestly do better when I actually, it's funny because I farm full time.

20:43.500 --> 20:47.420
I feel like that honestly is the best thing for me because I need to be able to have that kind

20:47.420 --> 20:52.540
of escape of like do something with my body, get outside, like get my mind clear

20:52.540 --> 20:54.220
and come back to the computer.

20:54.220 --> 20:59.660
And it's like those like couple hours, like people that are watching this,

20:59.660 --> 21:02.380
it's like you have such an advantage because like you're so dead.

21:04.220 --> 21:06.940
That's what kind of pushed me was like, hey, I don't want to get out of this,

21:06.940 --> 21:10.220
but I want to be able to like not rely on this source of income.

21:10.220 --> 21:13.180
I want to completely like live my life off this.

21:13.820 --> 21:16.860
And so like that kind of motivated me, but like I would do it for a couple hours a day,

21:16.860 --> 21:20.860
but I felt like I got more out of the two hours at night after I got done farming,

21:20.860 --> 21:25.260
then I did the eight hours of sitting at my computer because I can't focus for that long.

21:25.260 --> 21:27.100
Like I literally can't just sit down for eight hours.

21:27.100 --> 21:31.500
Like I have to do 30 minutes, go do something, 30 minutes, do something, but I can't do it.

21:31.500 --> 21:36.620
So for me, it's just like do something, go work out, do whatever I need to do, sit down,

21:36.620 --> 21:40.780
say, hey, I got two hours and I get so much more done in two hours than I did eight hours.

21:41.340 --> 21:42.060
I agree.

21:42.060 --> 21:43.260
I'm a little bit like that too.

21:45.180 --> 21:45.420
Okay.

21:45.420 --> 21:49.260
I have just a couple more questions and then I want you to show one of your websites that you built

21:49.340 --> 21:54.540
and you can tell us, you can be one you're most proud of, the one that's the ugliest.

21:54.540 --> 21:57.420
And I want you to tell everyone how much you're making for that website,

21:57.420 --> 21:58.620
but a couple of quick questions.

21:58.620 --> 22:00.700
How long did it actually take you to build your first site?

22:04.460 --> 22:10.700
Probably took me like realistically, probably like to build it out like a month

22:10.700 --> 22:13.100
and then to do all the other jazz, you know, it was just kind of slow.

22:13.100 --> 22:14.060
I'd say like a month.

22:14.060 --> 22:16.620
And working on that, that was like two hours a day.

22:17.420 --> 22:17.900
Yeah.

22:18.300 --> 22:18.540
Yeah.

22:19.180 --> 22:19.500
Okay.

22:21.580 --> 22:23.340
I already asked that question.

22:23.340 --> 22:26.780
What do you think is the biggest reason that people don't start doing this?

22:26.780 --> 22:28.300
So I have people all the time.

22:28.300 --> 22:32.380
They're like, I'll have people message and again, this isn't like a ton of people,

22:32.380 --> 22:38.780
but occasionally people will message me and say, hey man, I see what you're up to

22:38.780 --> 22:40.940
and I'm wondering if it's something that I can do.

22:40.940 --> 22:41.580
I'm interested.

22:41.580 --> 22:43.180
I hate my job, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

22:43.180 --> 22:44.860
And then I like, I never hear back from them.

22:45.740 --> 22:53.100
So I guess at some point they just like get spooked or they get sidetracked or whatever.

22:53.100 --> 22:55.420
What do you think is the biggest reason people don't start doing this?

22:58.460 --> 23:01.820
I think it's a fear of failing.

23:01.820 --> 23:02.380
I really do.

23:02.380 --> 23:06.540
I think it's like, I don't want to try something and then it's worked for us.

23:06.540 --> 23:11.260
And so like, if it doesn't work for them, it's going to be maybe embarrassing in a way.

23:11.260 --> 23:14.620
Like I almost just feel like it's this lack of trust in themselves.

23:15.260 --> 23:20.220
In securities and it could be the money, but like you really can't argue with the

23:20.220 --> 23:22.540
fact that it costs $80 to build this website.

23:22.540 --> 23:23.180
You know what I'm saying?

23:23.180 --> 23:26.220
Like literally the numbers, it's like a no brainer.

23:26.220 --> 23:29.660
But to someone, I just feel like it comes down to the excuse of like,

23:29.660 --> 23:33.420
oh, well he's got sales experience or he is Nick's brother or he's whatever.

23:33.420 --> 23:36.860
But it's like, if you don't make it work, like it's on you.

23:36.860 --> 23:39.100
It's not really the idea.

23:39.100 --> 23:41.500
You know, that's what I feel like why a lot of people fail.

23:41.500 --> 23:42.860
And a lot of people are just in their heads.

23:42.860 --> 23:44.460
They overthink the whole thing.

23:44.460 --> 23:47.660
And I think if you could just kind of dumb it down a little bit and just be like,

23:47.660 --> 23:48.780
dude, you could figure this out.

23:48.780 --> 23:52.380
It might take you a little bit longer than some of us, but like you'll figure it out.

23:52.380 --> 23:52.620
Yeah.

23:54.140 --> 23:58.140
What do you think is the biggest reason people fail that start doing this?

23:58.140 --> 24:00.380
We've all, by the way, just everybody knows.

24:00.380 --> 24:02.860
Not everybody that does this goes and makes 10K.

24:02.860 --> 24:04.140
Not everybody does this goes.

24:04.140 --> 24:06.060
I mean, we have extremes.

24:06.060 --> 24:08.780
I have one guy that he started working.

24:09.340 --> 24:10.860
We started teaching him two years ago.

24:10.860 --> 24:13.340
He's doing $87,000 per month.

24:14.460 --> 24:14.860
Insane.

24:15.500 --> 24:17.100
We've also got people quarter knows.

24:17.100 --> 24:20.860
I know that come in and every reason to succeed and then they fail.

24:21.740 --> 24:22.540
Why do you think that is?

24:22.540 --> 24:25.580
What's the biggest reason people fail that the ones that do start doing this?

24:25.580 --> 24:26.700
What's the biggest reason they fail?

24:29.660 --> 24:31.420
I think they get shiny object syndrome.

24:31.420 --> 24:33.580
I think they, they joined the course excited.

24:33.580 --> 24:38.220
They realized that, hey, it's, it's harder than they expected, which I think.

24:38.220 --> 24:41.820
Yeah, it's simple, but it's not like, you know, you have to do some work.

24:41.820 --> 24:44.300
It's not like it's, hey, as soon as you build a website, like,

24:44.300 --> 24:45.740
no more, you don't have to ever look at it.

24:45.740 --> 24:48.380
Like there, there's definitely some things you have to upkeep, right?

24:48.380 --> 24:48.860
It's a business.

24:48.860 --> 24:53.260
So there's like pullbacks and setbacks, but I think a lot of people will join

24:53.260 --> 24:55.260
and they don't see results right away.

24:55.260 --> 24:56.300
And so they jump ship.

24:56.300 --> 24:59.980
They find something else and they're like, I could maybe do this like a lot faster.

24:59.980 --> 25:03.100
When in reality, this took me two years and I'm making 10K.

25:03.980 --> 25:06.060
That's really not that long.

25:06.060 --> 25:06.300
Really?

25:06.300 --> 25:08.940
When you think about it, like, I know a lot of us want to make it like

25:08.940 --> 25:12.220
in the next two months, but it's like, I mean, I'll take it.

25:13.100 --> 25:14.300
Obviously, I want to do a lot more than that.

25:14.300 --> 25:18.620
But like, even if I was to do 10K every two years, I mean, I'm pretty happy.

25:18.620 --> 25:21.260
You know, for sure.

25:22.860 --> 25:24.620
I mean, if you're comparing that to like a job,

25:26.220 --> 25:30.380
let's say you're out of school and you're, let's say your entry level

25:30.380 --> 25:33.180
position is 10K a month, which means you have a really good degree

25:33.180 --> 25:35.740
and you're probably living in a city that you may or may not want to live in.

25:35.740 --> 25:37.660
And your costs are probably really expensive.

25:37.660 --> 25:41.580
You're definitely not doing 10K a month working at a job

25:41.580 --> 25:42.620
in Peru and Utah.

25:42.620 --> 25:43.660
That's just for sure.

25:44.460 --> 25:45.100
Yeah.

25:45.100 --> 25:50.460
But let's say you do, like, for you to get to 20K, for you to double your income

25:50.460 --> 25:51.580
is almost impossible.

25:52.380 --> 25:54.860
If you do, it's going to take you 10 years kissing a lot of butt,

25:54.860 --> 25:57.500
shaking hands, going to all the meetings, not pissing anyone off,

25:57.500 --> 26:01.420
not having any political views, go to the bathroom when you're told to go,

26:01.420 --> 26:04.940
only taking vacay, like just it's a mess and you can get fired at any point.

26:04.940 --> 26:07.900
So I wouldn't say it's too bad if two years were to work.

26:07.900 --> 26:08.460
You know what I mean?

26:09.500 --> 26:09.740
Yeah.

26:10.300 --> 26:14.860
So here's what I want to do, finish your thought and I've got two things

26:14.860 --> 26:17.180
I want to do, we'll end this live and then if anyone has questions.

26:19.900 --> 26:25.180
No, I was just going to say, I think that if you guys actually had a desire

26:25.180 --> 26:29.500
to start a business, I think if you guys really checked all the boxes

26:29.500 --> 26:32.140
that you guys want in a business, I think you guys would really realize

26:32.140 --> 26:34.300
that this could work for literally anybody.

26:35.900 --> 26:39.260
We have people that do this that are firemen that are, I mean, I'm farming.

26:39.900 --> 26:43.020
Police officers, like whatever you can, you can possibly name it.

26:43.020 --> 26:44.300
That's what's cool is I get it.

26:44.300 --> 26:47.580
You get to rub shoulders with people that, you know, wouldn't normally

26:48.220 --> 26:52.860
rub shoulders with and that every personality out there from 80 years old,

26:52.860 --> 26:54.620
what's our oldest person that does this?

26:54.620 --> 26:58.620
I don't know, but like pretty old, you know, and then down to we had

26:58.620 --> 27:00.140
a 16 year old that was landing deals.

27:02.380 --> 27:06.060
Yeah, I mean, definitely a few in the 60s.

27:06.060 --> 27:07.340
I think we had one guy in the 70s.

27:07.340 --> 27:08.220
I don't know 80.

27:08.220 --> 27:12.540
Maybe not 80, but 80 might be a little bit.

27:12.540 --> 27:14.300
You might be over the hump at 80.

27:14.300 --> 27:15.020
No, I'm kidding.

27:15.020 --> 27:17.820
If you're 80 and you want to do this, I promise you I'll work with your hands

27:17.820 --> 27:20.220
on it because that'd be a sick case study.

27:21.820 --> 27:24.460
We start slinging this to a whole new audience.

27:24.460 --> 27:25.180
You know what I'm saying?

27:25.180 --> 27:26.780
No, it doesn't matter what age you are.

27:26.780 --> 27:29.580
If you're willing to learn, it's cool.

27:30.380 --> 27:31.340
It's doable, right?

27:32.540 --> 27:37.020
Especially for two people coming from Parawant, Utah.

27:37.020 --> 27:38.620
Evil waters, baby.

27:38.620 --> 27:39.420
You know what I'm saying?

27:41.340 --> 27:42.380
Shout out to Parawant, by the way.

27:43.820 --> 27:45.180
It was an amazing childhood.

27:45.180 --> 27:47.500
So I just, you know, just having fun.

27:48.220 --> 27:52.300
So Porter, I want you to show one of your websites that you've built

27:52.300 --> 27:55.740
with your own hands, your own money that's making you money.

27:55.740 --> 27:59.260
And I'm going to ask you a final question as we sail off into the sunset.

27:59.260 --> 28:01.340
It's 848 where I'm at in Dubai.

28:01.340 --> 28:02.140
Porter's in Parawant, Utah.

28:02.140 --> 28:02.940
What time is it there, dude?

28:04.140 --> 28:06.380
It is 948.

28:06.380 --> 28:07.020
948.

28:07.020 --> 28:07.740
You're starting today.

28:07.740 --> 28:08.700
I'm just really getting done.

28:09.420 --> 28:10.700
So I'm going to give you co-hosts.

28:10.700 --> 28:11.900
I want you to show one of your sites.

28:13.340 --> 28:13.660
Okay.

28:14.700 --> 28:15.180
Real quick.

28:16.140 --> 28:19.100
I could even give you one that I'm building right now.

28:19.980 --> 28:20.780
Let's show.

28:20.780 --> 28:23.740
Do you have one that's, show, just show us the site real quick.

28:24.860 --> 28:26.940
Go look, what's, oh, you want to give me the domain?

28:26.940 --> 28:27.900
You want to give me the domain?

28:27.900 --> 28:28.860
I'll log, I'll check it out.

28:31.020 --> 28:34.940
Yeah, do Lawrencevilleconcrete.com.

28:36.380 --> 28:38.940
Lawrencevilleconcrete.com.

28:41.900 --> 28:42.220
Okay.

28:42.220 --> 28:43.820
Let me see if it goes to it really quick.

28:43.820 --> 28:44.860
Then I'll share my screen.

28:45.820 --> 28:48.780
I can guarantee you Porter just gave you his best site.

28:48.780 --> 28:51.340
So whatever this is, just guarantee this is the best one.

28:51.340 --> 28:52.620
There's no way he gave us his ugliest.

28:55.020 --> 28:55.580
Just kidding.

28:56.140 --> 28:56.700
All right.

28:56.700 --> 28:57.260
This one up?

28:59.500 --> 29:00.220
Yeah, that's it.

29:00.860 --> 29:01.180
Okay.

29:02.060 --> 29:03.740
So check this bad boy out.

29:06.860 --> 29:08.380
It's actually pretty sound.

29:08.380 --> 29:13.740
It's not, you know, obviously isn't a web design beauty or anything like that, but

29:13.740 --> 29:14.700
it looks better than mine.

29:14.700 --> 29:15.660
I'll buy a long shot.

29:16.220 --> 29:18.220
He's got his tracking number here.

29:18.220 --> 29:19.740
He's got his little quote form.

29:19.740 --> 29:20.860
He's got his content.

29:21.420 --> 29:24.780
He's actually got some really, if you, you might not know this because

29:24.780 --> 29:28.060
you wouldn't know what to look for, but he's actually done a really sound SEO.

29:28.860 --> 29:31.180
I can just tell with some of the stuff he has up in the heading.

29:31.980 --> 29:32.620
I'm sorry.

29:32.620 --> 29:35.180
In the page description up here.

29:35.820 --> 29:37.500
But actually this is pretty solid.

29:37.500 --> 29:40.700
So how much is this little website making you per month?

29:42.860 --> 29:46.060
This one right here is making me 1600 per month.

29:46.940 --> 29:48.780
$1,600 per month.

29:48.780 --> 29:49.980
Where's Lawrenceville by the way?

29:50.620 --> 29:50.940
Yes.

29:52.220 --> 29:55.980
That's in, uh, it's kind of outside of Atlanta, like a little suburb.

29:57.020 --> 29:57.900
So this is in Georgia.

29:57.900 --> 29:58.140
Okay.

29:59.340 --> 30:00.940
Lawrenceville concrete.

30:00.940 --> 30:02.620
Every time that phone number rings.

30:03.420 --> 30:07.180
Porter's bank account gets a little, gets a little dingle.

30:07.180 --> 30:11.660
It gets a little, a little bumpy every time he's golfing.

30:11.660 --> 30:14.300
He's on the tractor and that phone number rings.

30:14.300 --> 30:15.500
He's getting paid.

30:15.500 --> 30:16.300
Right.

30:16.300 --> 30:20.860
I kind of look at this like, um, kind of like, uh, Porter, you've seen

30:20.860 --> 30:21.900
despicable me, obviously.

30:25.420 --> 30:28.220
So I can get these minions, dude, that are out there and they're literally

30:28.220 --> 30:29.260
just doing work for you.

30:29.260 --> 30:32.940
But the difference is the minions have like feelings and stuff like that.

30:32.940 --> 30:34.140
These guys have no feelings.

30:34.140 --> 30:35.020
They don't need holidays.

30:35.020 --> 30:36.060
They don't need vacations.

30:36.060 --> 30:36.780
They're just working.

30:36.780 --> 30:39.180
You build them, you set them free.

30:39.180 --> 30:42.460
They go make you money and you could, you could build as many as you want.

30:42.460 --> 30:45.260
So, um, yeah, that's it guys.

30:45.260 --> 30:45.900
Super simple.

30:45.900 --> 30:48.060
So we got Zach, uh, Zach Porter.

30:48.060 --> 30:48.780
Sorry, dude.

30:52.140 --> 30:55.100
Sorry, by the way, um, sorry to call you that, bud.

30:56.060 --> 30:57.820
I got a little confused a little later here.

30:57.820 --> 30:58.620
No, it's okay.

30:58.700 --> 31:02.780
What advice would you give somebody watching this right now that is

31:02.780 --> 31:04.220
contemplating jumping into this?

31:04.220 --> 31:07.100
And then I'm going to go to Moses got a question, but what advice would

31:07.100 --> 31:11.340
you give somebody that's contemplating got a little toe dipped in the water

31:11.340 --> 31:16.780
thinking about jumping in, but they're nervous for this, that, whatever reason.

31:16.780 --> 31:18.060
What advice would you give them?

31:22.060 --> 31:26.620
Uh, I would, I would tell them, look at your life now.

31:27.260 --> 31:30.220
If you're happy with where you want to be great, then stay there.

31:30.220 --> 31:33.580
But I think most of us want a little bit more out of life than,

31:33.580 --> 31:39.580
then sometimes we put out, put out to be, I would say, if you're thinking

31:39.580 --> 31:41.740
about doing this, I would say, do it.

31:41.740 --> 31:42.940
I said that there's no other bit.

31:42.940 --> 31:45.500
Maybe there is a business model, but nothing that I would be interested in,

31:45.500 --> 31:48.620
but like, that is going to be able to make you the amount of money that you

31:48.620 --> 31:51.740
can do with being able to do something that you love.

31:51.740 --> 31:55.020
For example, I don't know if I could do any other business model while

31:55.420 --> 32:00.700
in love and this passive is a work to it.

32:00.700 --> 32:05.020
But like, you basically are checking every box that you possibly could do.

32:05.020 --> 32:06.220
I would say, don't overthink it.

32:06.220 --> 32:10.780
If we are literally as you do it for sure, there's plenty of people out

32:10.780 --> 32:14.220
there that are testimonials of that, but I wouldn't say just don't overthink.

32:15.420 --> 32:21.740
Say, Hey, I got a thousand bucks to, you would be able to, you could land a

32:21.740 --> 32:23.580
deal and you can get a client, you know?

32:23.580 --> 32:26.780
So I just, I would say, don't overthink it if I can do it.

32:28.540 --> 32:30.620
But I don't go out there.

32:31.420 --> 32:31.740
Yeah.

32:31.740 --> 32:32.380
I like that.

32:32.380 --> 32:33.100
That's good advice.

32:34.460 --> 32:34.940
Okay, bro.

32:35.660 --> 32:37.740
Moses said, how many customers are rent?

32:37.740 --> 32:39.740
By the way, I know that we're getting a little choppy here.

32:39.740 --> 32:42.620
We're about to end this, but he said, how many customers are renting the site?

32:42.620 --> 32:44.140
That's one customer, Mozo.

32:44.140 --> 32:46.620
So you don't, you could do this however you want.

32:46.620 --> 32:48.460
You could rent this to multiple companies.

32:48.460 --> 32:53.020
The way that Porter and I structure these is we work with one company per area.

32:53.660 --> 32:55.580
So for example, I know you're in South Africa.

32:55.580 --> 32:59.660
Let's say that you wanted to build a Johannesburg tree service site.

33:00.380 --> 33:04.300
You would want to work with one company locally and send them all weeks.

33:04.300 --> 33:09.020
Now you could split it up, but in my experience, working with one company,

33:09.020 --> 33:11.260
giving them a great service is the best way to do it.

33:12.620 --> 33:16.300
And then this follow up question said, is just one customer renting

33:16.300 --> 33:19.100
or many renting your site Porter's website?

33:20.540 --> 33:21.660
That is, yeah.

33:21.660 --> 33:23.500
So one customer per website.

33:24.380 --> 33:28.780
And there's a lot of reasons why we do that, which I can share with you.

33:28.780 --> 33:31.820
So anyway, guys, that's all I wanted to share.

33:32.620 --> 33:35.580
If you guys have any questions, Porter, actually, this is one thing

33:35.580 --> 33:37.180
that Porter has been really helpful to do.

33:37.980 --> 33:40.620
If people have questions and they just want to ask you,

33:40.620 --> 33:43.260
do you want to just, how can they reach out to you?

33:43.260 --> 33:46.540
Because he's been a really good, I know a bunch of people

33:46.540 --> 33:49.820
in some of the other groups have reached out to him that we're a part of.

33:49.820 --> 33:52.140
And he's really cool to just jump on like 15 minute call.

33:52.140 --> 33:56.460
Do you want to drop your cell phone number and they can text you or,

33:56.460 --> 33:58.060
and this is, this is actually your cell phone.

33:58.060 --> 34:00.300
This isn't like a, this isn't like a trap phone, right?

34:02.460 --> 34:04.220
No, this is my personal cell, dude.

34:04.220 --> 34:04.780
All right.

34:04.780 --> 34:06.380
Just checking this.

34:06.380 --> 34:06.780
Thank you.

34:06.780 --> 34:07.100
Sure.

34:07.100 --> 34:09.100
But that'll keep you on your toes.

34:09.100 --> 34:09.340
Okay.

34:12.940 --> 34:15.020
By the way, I'll send you a $10 gift card.

34:15.020 --> 34:17.100
If you go put him in one of those drawings in the mall

34:17.100 --> 34:21.420
for like the Harley-Davidson, just so he gets spam and dollars for every person.

34:23.260 --> 34:24.220
Or insurance, dude.

34:24.220 --> 34:25.900
Put me in for that insurance marketplace.

34:27.900 --> 34:30.780
Anyway, also, oh, I forgot to do this.

34:31.500 --> 34:31.980
Two things.

34:31.980 --> 34:33.020
Well, I'll just say one thing.

34:33.980 --> 34:35.100
I have a bunch of free stuff.

34:35.100 --> 34:37.900
I have a YouTube channel and I have a free,

34:37.900 --> 34:39.580
I'll drop the free training really quick.

34:39.580 --> 34:45.980
It's, it's called rentsimplesites.com.

34:47.980 --> 34:50.460
Just to give you guys an idea, like an overview of what we do.

34:51.420 --> 34:56.620
And then we actually just launched this rankandretire.com,

34:57.660 --> 35:00.940
which is a community of people that are just kind of getting into this,

35:00.940 --> 35:04.940
want to get their feet wet, but aren't quite ready to pull the trigger.

35:06.460 --> 35:08.300
I'm like doing this for real for real.

35:09.260 --> 35:13.900
You guys can go to rankandretire.com and I don't know if those links pull up for you.

35:13.900 --> 35:15.500
Can you see them on your end quarter?

35:15.500 --> 35:16.460
I don't think it works.

35:17.740 --> 35:18.780
Can you see them in the chat?

35:22.700 --> 35:22.940
Okay.

35:24.140 --> 35:24.620
No.

35:24.620 --> 35:25.020
Awesome.

35:25.020 --> 35:26.060
Guys, thanks for being on this call.

35:26.060 --> 35:27.100
Porter, thanks for being on.

35:27.100 --> 35:29.740
And that's it, guys.

35:29.740 --> 35:32.220
We'll, we'll see you guys whenever we decide to go live next.

35:32.220 --> 35:32.700
Thanks, bro.

35:32.700 --> 35:33.180
See you soon.

35:34.380 --> 35:34.780
Thanks.

35:34.780 --> 35:35.180
Thanks.
