1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,920
B was the same guy that was like yo, can you close deals in December? I'm like dude, come on

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,240
Yeah, you can and I literally that's why I put that on my story

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,720
I said do bear do bear shit in the wood

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:15,640
There's a bear shit in the woods and you said not in December, which I know we were both joking

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:20,960
But guys it is December like that's a really good. In fact, I want to bring that up

6
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,920
Some of you guys are frustrated. Like I had a couple people that were like, hey

7
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,400
I've got these campaigns that are not like there's no clicks

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,320
Impressions and all this different shit, but there's no clicks and I a couple of those people I said, okay

9
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:38,520
What are your niches and a lot of them are niches that we said were good like concrete tree service

10
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:43,080
They are good, but you guys have to still keep in mind. There's other factors, right?

11
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:51,120
so for example, if you are thinking you're gonna do like a concrete Legion in South Dakota or North Dakota or

12
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,200
Minnesota and it's gonna pop off in December

13
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:01,600
It's not okay, you're still probably gonna get a lead here and there but guys it's cold as shit than those places

14
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:07,180
People don't want it like I have tree service clients that literally don't work in the winter

15
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,680
So if I was doing tree service, I would think what spots are warm

16
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:16,640
Florida feet like there's just one more layer. I shouldn't have to cover that you guys need to just use your head, right?

17
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:23,040
It's the same thing. Don't go put up an artificial grass site in some shitty-ass city in Kansas

18
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:29,760
Because it year-round it's probably not gonna be that great go do it in the Florida and the Phoenix and the Vegas whatever, right?

19
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:35,240
and obviously take it through module one, but the reason that B has been so successful is

20
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,080
He the niche he's going after and now everyone's gonna be like, oh towing is the niche

21
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,720
The reason that's good is because he's hitting it while it's hot. That's great

22
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:47,640
You hit it while it's hot slap him in a contract now. He's gonna when he pitches the deal

23
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,240
He needs to make sure to say hey, look, we know December's hot

24
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,680
But when it gets a little bit slower in the summer whenever the slow season is for for towing

25
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:02,240
It's the same thing as the winter for concrete. So B's getting leads quick because he's in towing is it because it's towing

26
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,800
No, it's because he's picking a niche now like I'm just throwing that out there because I know a couple of you guys

27
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:15,140
You guys still have to be humans, okay, you still have to consider that I am NOT doing concrete in Minnesota

28
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:19,060
No way in hell. Okay, so start using our heads a little bit

29
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:25,880
I'm also not doing snow removal just because it's hot right now because it's gonna be completely dead in the summer. Okay
