OK, Ariel says, why do you not touch the ones that have CPC as NA?

00:05.600 --> 00:07.920
So the reason why, real quick on that, Ariel,

00:07.920 --> 00:12.200
is because typically with CPC, think about it, right?

00:12.200 --> 00:13.200
Supply and demand.

00:13.200 --> 00:17.120
So if the cost per click is zero, that

00:17.120 --> 00:19.800
means there's nobody else bidding on it, right?

00:19.800 --> 00:22.280
There's no marketers, there's no business owners,

00:22.280 --> 00:25.040
there's no one else that's wanting to pay for those ads.

00:25.040 --> 00:29.720
Which I can therefore infer that it's worth nothing, right?

00:29.720 --> 00:33.520
So for example, you're going to have a keyword like cheap concrete

00:33.520 --> 00:36.640
companies in Newport, whatever, right?

00:36.640 --> 00:38.240
That CPC is zero.

00:38.240 --> 00:39.200
Why?

00:39.200 --> 00:40.560
Because no one cares about it.

00:40.560 --> 00:44.200
So if you want to go like those CPCs, the reason why

00:44.200 --> 00:46.440
is because it's typically a waste of time, right?

00:46.440 --> 00:47.840
There's no volume.

00:47.840 --> 00:50.680
It says there's volume, but it's not worth anything.

00:50.680 --> 00:52.320
So if you want to go test it out, cool.

00:52.320 --> 00:54.120
And there's probably a couple situations

00:54.120 --> 00:55.800
where, yeah, it's going to work.

00:55.800 --> 01:01.680
But I'm just using my intuition of saying, OK, there's CPC that's

01:01.680 --> 01:05.480
zero, which means nobody cares enough to pay for it,

01:05.480 --> 01:09.400
which means there's one of many things, right?

01:09.400 --> 01:13.000
There's too much supply and not enough demand or vice versa.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.360
So that's why.

01:14.360 --> 01:16.400
Hope that makes sense.
