B was the same guy that was like yo, can you close deals in December? I'm like dude, come on

00:06.000 --> 00:09.240
Yeah, you can and I literally that's why I put that on my story

00:09.240 --> 00:11.720
I said do bear do bear shit in the wood

00:11.720 --> 00:15.640
There's a bear shit in the woods and you said not in December, which I know we were both joking

00:15.640 --> 00:20.960
But guys it is December like that's a really good. In fact, I want to bring that up

00:21.520 --> 00:24.920
Some of you guys are frustrated. Like I had a couple people that were like, hey

00:24.920 --> 00:27.400
I've got these campaigns that are not like there's no clicks

00:28.400 --> 00:33.320
Impressions and all this different shit, but there's no clicks and I a couple of those people I said, okay

00:33.320 --> 00:38.520
What are your niches and a lot of them are niches that we said were good like concrete tree service

00:38.560 --> 00:43.080
They are good, but you guys have to still keep in mind. There's other factors, right?

00:43.080 --> 00:51.120
so for example, if you are thinking you're gonna do like a concrete Legion in South Dakota or North Dakota or

00:51.520 --> 00:54.200
Minnesota and it's gonna pop off in December

00:54.840 --> 01:01.600
It's not okay, you're still probably gonna get a lead here and there but guys it's cold as shit than those places

01:02.840 --> 01:07.180
People don't want it like I have tree service clients that literally don't work in the winter

01:07.200 --> 01:10.680
So if I was doing tree service, I would think what spots are warm

01:11.800 --> 01:16.640
Florida feet like there's just one more layer. I shouldn't have to cover that you guys need to just use your head, right?

01:17.400 --> 01:23.040
It's the same thing. Don't go put up an artificial grass site in some shitty-ass city in Kansas

01:23.440 --> 01:29.760
Because it year-round it's probably not gonna be that great go do it in the Florida and the Phoenix and the Vegas whatever, right?

01:29.760 --> 01:35.240
and obviously take it through module one, but the reason that B has been so successful is

01:36.040 --> 01:40.080
He the niche he's going after and now everyone's gonna be like, oh towing is the niche

01:40.240 --> 01:43.720
The reason that's good is because he's hitting it while it's hot. That's great

01:43.720 --> 01:47.640
You hit it while it's hot slap him in a contract now. He's gonna when he pitches the deal

01:47.640 --> 01:50.240
He needs to make sure to say hey, look, we know December's hot

01:50.280 --> 01:54.680
But when it gets a little bit slower in the summer whenever the slow season is for for towing

01:54.920 --> 02:02.240
It's the same thing as the winter for concrete. So B's getting leads quick because he's in towing is it because it's towing

02:02.240 --> 02:07.800
No, it's because he's picking a niche now like I'm just throwing that out there because I know a couple of you guys

02:09.800 --> 02:15.140
You guys still have to be humans, okay, you still have to consider that I am NOT doing concrete in Minnesota

02:15.620 --> 02:19.060
No way in hell. Okay, so start using our heads a little bit

02:19.060 --> 02:25.880
I'm also not doing snow removal just because it's hot right now because it's gonna be completely dead in the summer. Okay
