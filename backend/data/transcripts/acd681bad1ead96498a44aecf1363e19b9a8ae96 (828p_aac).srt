1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,440
If you're cold calling and not sending leads in advance,

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,600
so the built-in trust isn't there,

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,600
how would you go about building enough trust

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,240
on the first call when the I need to think about it

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,120
comes up at the end of the call?

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,500
So to make sure everyone understands this question guys,

7
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,000
he's talking about like, if you wanna start cold calling

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,360
without doing the leads in advance,

9
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,020
which is totally doable, right?

10
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,720
I mean, people do it all the time.

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,360
I think that it can be done.

12
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,640
I wouldn't recommend it.

13
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,800
If you're new, I wouldn't recommend it.

14
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,360
Some of you guys might be looking at, go, well,

15
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,120
if I do that, then I could save a little bit of money.

16
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,240
It's like, it's so much easier with leads

17
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,480
that I don't recommend it, right?

18
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,600
However, if you decide,

19
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,080
cause I know Shane's gone pretty far

20
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:47,040
and he's 10,000 a month plus.

21
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,160
He knows what he's doing.

22
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,520
Maybe he wants to just kind of try his hand in it.

23
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,000
That Shane, it's simple is I'm using,

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,120
I'm selling through my other customers.

25
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,800
I'm showing, I'm over showing examples.

26
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,040
I'm using everything I say is not what I say.

27
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,120
It's what Joe, my duct cleaning client said.

28
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,240
It's what Marianne, my tow truck client said.

29
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,600
We call it selling through the neighbors, right?

30
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,080
And I'm referring over and over and over.

31
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,760
You know, anything they have, any question,

32
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,760
you gotta use the neighbors.

33
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,160
You gotta use your business owners.

34
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,400
That's it, you have to.

35
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,280
You're gonna have to show a lot of examples.

36
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,920
That's gonna be the trust, right?

37
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,360
When you give leads in advance,

38
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,760
that's how you overcome the objection of trust.

39
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,920
But if you don't have leads in advance,

40
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,000
then you have to use other means.

41
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,080
And so I would say selling through your customers,

42
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,920
using stories, using screenshots of text messages,

43
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,440
pulling up call rail and showing them,

44
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,920
hey, here's what this guy did.

45
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,320
Here's how many leads he got.

46
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,840
That's basically the only way

47
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,240
you're gonna be able to do it.
