1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
All right, let's do this.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,120
Let's do this call.

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:05,200
Let me hit everyone.

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,720
Let's do this and let's rock and roll.

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,720
Okay.

6
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:16,800
So like I said, we've got Michael Steiner, we've got Shelly Xander, we've got Ritu and

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,520
everyone else I mentioned before, Stephanie Prather, shout out to Stephanie Prather.

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:26,840
We interviewed her last week on, it was on Thursday night actually, and coming live from

9
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:33,000
Las Vegas, Nevada, she is at, she just hit $11,900 per month.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,280
So shout out to her.

11
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,920
Pierre, let's get going, bro.

12
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,520
You can hear me still, right?

13
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,520
Yeah.

14
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:39,520
Okay.

15
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,520
Let's do this thing.

16
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,640
I'm just making sure that I can still see myself and see you.

17
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,520
Ritu says good morning.

18
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,760
So Pierre, we're going to jump right into it yesterday.

19
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,000
We did a little bit of the other stuff.

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,080
Maybe I'll just fill everybody in.

21
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:56,440
So Pierre was somebody who had tried a bunch of different business models.

22
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,400
He was looking for the right one.

23
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:04,520
He's originally from France and moved to Thailand once, hold on, see how good I am.

24
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:12,000
You moved there in 2000, the first time in 2018, and then he moved there again in 2023.

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,320
But this time he came here and when he moved to Thailand, he's like, dude, I'm doubling

26
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,200
down on rank and rent and I'm going to make this work.

27
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,320
Before you were doing stuff with fitness and all kinds of stuff, making pretty good money,

28
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,160
but you didn't see the scalability.

29
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,840
How close was I on that story?

30
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,840
Decent?

31
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,840
Decent.

32
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,440
I missed some details, but everything I said was correct, right?

33
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,440
I didn't say anything wrong.

34
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,440
I didn't do fitness.

35
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,440
It was business.

36
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:42,360
I was consulting freelancers to basically find a customer, but sometimes-

37
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,360
Okay.

38
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,760
I thought for some reason, because I remember you told me one time you met Alex Hermosy,

39
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,640
so I always thought you were in the fitness world.

40
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:54,480
It's my previous business partner that I started the business with, Anthony, that you might

41
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,980
have talked with before.

42
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:59,260
So yeah, he was quite big in the fitness in France.

43
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,260
Okay, cool.

44
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,260
All right.

45
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:05,100
Well, dude, I just want to get into this.

46
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:09,220
So Pierre's at $12,370 per month.

47
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:15,460
He has one of his deals, he gets paid a flat fee and then he makes commissions on top.

48
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:19,700
So this month he's probably going to collect between 15 and 20K per month.

49
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:25,980
But I specifically want to talk about the details of how you've been able to get to

50
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:26,980
$12,370.

51
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,500
By the way, again, he's also doing this from Thailand.

52
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,720
So any of you that are outside the US that think, oh my gosh, I can't do this because

53
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,740
I don't have an American accent or I'm not from the US, that's a bunch of crap.

54
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,740
That's not true.

55
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:41,860
It doesn't matter.

56
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:49,060
One of our other colleagues that's in my group, Mike V, is in Thailand with Pierre.

57
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,060
He's in a different part of Thailand.

58
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,060
Good friends, yeah.

59
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,060
Yeah, but he's crushing it too.

60
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:57,900
He's at like 40 grand a month and he's actually targeting New Zealand and all of his clients

61
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:58,900
are in New Zealand.

62
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,020
So let's start there, bro.

63
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,020
Are your clients in France?

64
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,220
Are your clients in US, Thailand?

65
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,220
Where are you targeting?

66
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,980
100% in France right now.

67
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:07,980
100% French.

68
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:08,980
Yeah.

69
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,060
That's amazing, dude.

70
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:14,900
So I'm going to ask you this question because a lot of people when they start talking about

71
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:19,340
targeting the UK or targeting Australia or targeting somewhere beside the US, you know

72
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,340
what they always say?

73
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,340
Yeah.

74
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,340
It's not going to work.

75
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:27,620
Well, they say it can work, but they're like business owners don't want to pay very much

76
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,260
and it's hard to convince them.

77
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,540
So tell me about that, dude.

78
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,540
How has that been?

79
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:35,420
I mean, I've lunch, I think maybe two or three ads in the US.

80
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:40,180
I had a few leads and I've kind of tried both at the same time and I like it clicked faster

81
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:47,540
France, but I'm still kind of in between, you know, I might go in the US at some point.

82
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:51,780
But yeah, I think like it's hard to really judge how it is in the US.

83
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:57,340
But from what I see, it feels more business friendly, just from the culture and what I

84
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,340
see.

85
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,340
But in France, it's also work.

86
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,900
I would say France is probably harder to get the credit card.

87
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,700
But then people are really, how to say, recurring.

88
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,540
I have almost no children.

89
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:13,780
I have a guy like his struggle amounts, but overall, like they don't want a child.

90
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:20,100
And yeah, man, it's like probably harder to get going, but then the trust is very high.

91
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,100
That's amazing.

92
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:25,140
So he is doing this exactly entirely in France.

93
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:30,620
So those of you that are in your home country, whether you're in Argentina or whatever the

94
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:35,900
case is, I'm not saying every country is going to work because, for example, I spent a lot

95
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,380
of time in Sierra Leone.

96
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:40,860
I can already tell you it's not going to work really well in Sierra Leone because people

97
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,420
don't really search the Internet.

98
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:45,180
They do a lot of referral stuff.

99
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:49,900
But there are countries, France, I bet you it would work really well in Belgium.

100
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:54,620
I bet you it would work well in, of course, in London and Ireland and these different

101
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,620
places.

102
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,900
But so that's interesting.

103
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,660
So let's talk about this.

104
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:04,240
Before we got on, you told me most of your deals are through pre-selling, through going

105
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,820
and getting the client first.

106
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,620
How has it been running ads in France?

107
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:16,780
So I started, that's probably one of the few things I've tweaked from your model.

108
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:19,380
Smart campaign didn't work in France.

109
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:25,460
So I had to straight go into expert mode and it didn't work so well.

110
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:30,300
Like actually, my first maybe 12 months was I was launching ads, I had a few leads, I

111
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,700
was closing a deal, then no more leads or like one a week or something.

112
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,700
Then the guy would turn.

113
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,740
Then I would try to improve ads.

114
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:43,100
Then I would go again to sell and until I figure out how to make enough leads, you know.

115
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,660
So I work on it, work on it.

116
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:50,620
I was about to stop doing Google ads and go all in in SEO because it was working better.

117
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,420
And Mike really helped me out.

118
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:58,380
Like honestly, I think it's the best guy I met in this community towards Google ads is

119
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,380
just crushing it.

120
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:03,820
I don't know if you knew that, but he was doing Google ads like four or five years before

121
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:08,580
he started, which is why he's super good and exactly in this in Legion.

122
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:12,700
So then we build up the skills and now we have like dedicated landing page and we kind

123
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,700
of duplicate there.

124
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:18,540
It's super quick and we have like a list of keywords, negative keywords and everything.

125
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:23,340
So it's just we are much better at Google ads now and now it's working.

126
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:26,180
We just launched new ads last week.

127
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:30,460
There is leads coming in, customers are paying and just speed up everything.

128
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:35,740
So now we are doing ads all the time, except some smaller sites that are already ranked

129
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:39,740
and we don't really need to put ads and we just want to keep full profit stuff like that.

130
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:42,780
But the main strategy is pre-selling for sure.

131
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:48,180
So for the people on this call that maybe don't know my strategy that I teach or that

132
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:51,100
I believe in, maybe you can just walk them through.

133
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,380
I know some of the people are going to be like, oh, here we go again because we always

134
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,380
talk about it.

135
00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:00,580
Just in a nutshell, obviously everyone in here knows the regular strategy, right?

136
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:04,700
Pick a city and niche, rank the website, try to go sell it, right?

137
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,860
Tell everyone what we do with pre-selling.

138
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:12,180
Yeah, I mean, I think it's not boring, man, because I still work through the whole process

139
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:16,020
once in a while, like every few months to kind of simplify everything and have everything

140
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,020
in my head.

141
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:21,820
So I think I did it a couple of times, probably, I don't know, a hundred times now because

142
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,780
I didn't close all the deals.

143
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:28,740
So it's like, first of all, you do the due diligence, you have a whole part of this in

144
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,940
your program, which I think it's great as well.

145
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:39,820
Basically, you look for enough volume to get enough leads and not too much competition

146
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:43,340
so you can rank the site for a good area.

147
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,340
Then you build a prospect list.

148
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,540
Now we have a VA that does this, it's super, super simple.

149
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:50,380
You get people that do Google Ads.

150
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,380
That's a tweak I made.

151
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,740
So I did a post in an approval with Shiv about that.

152
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:59,500
Now I SMS people, I don't do call call, I use Shiv strategy.

153
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:04,540
It's super good, man, honestly, for me, I prefer this because I know how to call call.

154
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:08,620
I'm not afraid to do it, but it's just, I don't know, it's shitty because you are interrupting

155
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,620
people.

156
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,580
With SMS, they get back to me.

157
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:17,980
So I SMS like the 10, 15 people that I have in my prospecting list and they either SMS

158
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:18,980
back.

159
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:19,980
They're like, who are you?

160
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:20,980
What do you want?

161
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,580
I can do the job, whatever.

162
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,580
Or they call.

163
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:28,460
So if they call, I just reply and they call me, you know, so it's switch the frame.

164
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,460
That's cool.

165
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:33,860
Call calling 100% work is just, I don't know, a bit better for me.

166
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,860
I just prefer it this way.

167
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:41,820
And then I do your 100% your script, the few questions, like I think there is 10 questions,

168
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:47,020
like when can you do the quote, when can you do the work, whatever.

169
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,020
I qualify this.

170
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:52,500
And this, at first, I was quite shy when I started, I was like, I didn't know.

171
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:58,180
Now I really do this more as an interview, you know, I'm like, okay, man, qualify, why

172
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:02,380
should I send you my lead, you know, and the frame will switch with experience and doing

173
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,420
it more.

174
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:07,300
And that makes the deal much easier because the guy is like, yeah, yeah, I have a team,

175
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,700
I can do more business, you know, like, are you sure, man?

176
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,700
Are you working on Saturday?

177
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,700
You know, if I send you a quote tomorrow, can you do it?

178
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,700
Yeah, yeah.

179
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:21,380
They're trying to sell you, they're trying to sell you though, smart.

180
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:25,100
And that didn't came straight because I didn't do this industry contractor, they are really

181
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:29,220
strong frame, like they, I don't know, they are doing heavy stuff all day, so on the phone,

182
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:32,300
they don't really have time, they don't really care about you, so you really need to understand

183
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,300
how to talk with them.

184
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:37,420
For me, it took me a month to really figure it out, try again, and I'm still improving

185
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,420
it.

186
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:44,900
And yeah, after that, I transfer a few leads, with time I transfer less and less and I really

187
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:52,220
talk, qualify them, qualify them, and then I do the closing call, your script again,

188
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:56,820
I linked it a bit more with the backend, like now I try to get as many information so then

189
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:02,020
my team can implement without me doing anything.

190
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,020
That's the main thing.

191
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:10,900
And then onboarding, usually, I text them a bit, everything's okay, and that's it, man.

192
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,700
So yeah, I love that, dude.

193
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:17,740
And by the way, I love, this is the thing, guys, is once you have a really good process

194
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:23,300
that works, you learn it, you do it until you've started to get deals, and then just

195
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:29,620
like Pyr did, he took my process, he's doing like 90% of it, he did it a few times, then

196
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:34,820
he realized, hey, I'm gonna make these couple of changes that are, they're not gonna change

197
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:39,100
the fundamental process, but they're gonna make it a little bit easier, so instead of

198
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:43,860
cold calling, he's using the text strategy that Shiv's using, everything the same, then

199
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:48,780
he uses the text strategy, which I love because then they're coming at you, so then the leverage

200
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:51,100
is with you, right?

201
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,100
So you're not worried about it.

202
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:55,580
Yeah, so it just completely changes the dynamic.

203
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,500
So guys, yeah, the strategy's really simple.

204
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:01,420
Instead of waiting for the website to rank, we run ads, right?

205
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:05,260
You run ads, you run Google ads, and you get leads up front.

206
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:08,100
You get the leads, you take the leads, you go, you send them to a business owner, you

207
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:12,420
get them excited, you close the deal, you get the credit card, and then you do everything

208
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,980
that Shiv teaches in this program.

209
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:19,820
You build the site, you rank the site, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, okay?

210
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:25,180
One thing I was gonna mention really quick is the reason why I like Google ads.

211
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,660
So I wanna say this.

212
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:30,900
I actually did a podcast on this yesterday, you guys can check it out on my YouTube channel,

213
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:37,380
and I put, the title of the podcast was Can You Use Facebook Ads for Rank and Rent, right?

214
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,620
The short answer is yes, you can.

215
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:42,820
And I want you guys to understand that you can use whatever you want.

216
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:49,580
The strategy is running paid ads up front to get leads, and sending the leads in advance.

217
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,900
That's the strategy.

218
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:54,500
The tactic that I use is Google ads.

219
00:11:54,500 --> 00:12:00,340
The reason why I like Google ads over Facebook ads is because there's buyer intent.

220
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:03,820
That's the biggest, number one biggest reason is there's buyer intent.

221
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:04,900
What do I mean by that?

222
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:09,060
If somebody is on Google, they're looking to solve a problem.

223
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:14,340
Pool deck resurfacing, near me, right?

224
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:17,460
What are some of the niches you're in, Pierre?

225
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:24,380
The classic landscaping, concrete, whatever, it's a bit different in France, but honestly,

226
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:28,260
I was like, if I go to another country, I don't wanna reinvent the niche as well.

227
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,500
I wanna just do the classic one.

228
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,460
I'm probably gonna try some new one, maybe this year, next year, because now we are more

229
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:40,180
experienced, we have more budget, but at the beginning, I was like, let's just do the basic.

230
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,180
Exactly.

231
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:49,740
So same thing, concrete, if somebody's on Google and they type in concrete Paris, France,

232
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:53,580
I know you're not in Paris or from Paris, but concrete Paris, France, they're looking

233
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,500
for concrete, right?

234
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,620
Whereas somebody on Facebook, they're scrolling Facebook, looking at what their friends are

235
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:02,660
doing and they see a concrete ad, they're not necessarily looking for concrete.

236
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:06,420
They might schedule an estimate, they might look for pricing, but they're not looking

237
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,420
for concrete.

238
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:13,780
So if you gave me, if you said you could have 100 Facebook leads or you could have 50 Google

239
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:16,180
leads, I'll take the Google leads all day, okay?

240
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:21,220
However, I will tell you that I do know Facebook ads, you can get a lot more for cheaper.

241
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:25,340
I do know that there's some advantages there, but here's the other reason I like Google

242
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:30,460
ads, guys, is if you run Google ads in Paris, okay?

243
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:36,940
I now get to pay Google to put me on page one of Google, so I get to see what would

244
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:42,180
it be like ranking number one for concrete on Paris without even waiting six months,

245
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,180
right?

246
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:47,540
If I run Facebook ads, I have no idea what it's like, what kind of leads, how many leads,

247
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,980
I don't have any idea.

248
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:53,620
You don't get to test the market in the same way you do with Google ads.

249
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:56,500
But keep in mind, Pierre, you could do anything.

250
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,860
You could do Bing ads.

251
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:03,560
You could actually, I always joke, you could go and put on your birthday suit and stand

252
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:08,200
on the corner and twirl a sign that says free concrete estimate.

253
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,380
You can get free leads and use those.

254
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:14,220
You could get Facebook, you could get leads inside Facebook groups.

255
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,840
You could put up a billboard.

256
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,580
You could go talk to all your neighbors.

257
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:21,580
It doesn't matter how you get the initial leads, the thing that we do is we send the

258
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,580
leads up front.

259
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:25,980
By the way, Pierre, do you know what the birthday suit is in English?

260
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:27,940
No.

261
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,940
Birthday suit means you're naked.

262
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:30,940
Oh, OK.

263
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,160
So I'm saying, like, it doesn't matter.

264
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,160
You're getting attention.

265
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,180
You take, you go on the corner naked and twirl a sign.

266
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:39,900
You're probably going to get attention, but you might not get the best leads.

267
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,780
You might get the wrong, you might put up the wrong impression, right?

268
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:49,060
I would go on an estimate from someone that's naked on a street corner, personally.

269
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,060
You know what I mean?

270
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,060
Some people might.

271
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:55,540
So depending on the city, you go to that, do that in Vegas, it probably going to work,

272
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,980
it's probably going to work really well.

273
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,300
So I kind of jumped ahead.

274
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,740
So you're just in the basic niches, right?

275
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:02,740
Yeah, man.

276
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:08,580
I think, honestly, this business to do what you did, like to make a six-figure year, six-figure

277
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:13,620
months, I'm not there yet, but I think I can still do the same niche, you know?

278
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,660
Yeah, no, that's my opinion, dude.

279
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:19,460
It's like, why are we trying to overcomplicate the process?

280
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,660
Like it already, it's proven to work.

281
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,700
So we know concrete works.

282
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:24,700
Why not use it?

283
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:28,340
We know that artificial grass works.

284
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,340
Why not use it?

285
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:33,180
Why are we trying to find these crazy, interesting, at least that's my opinion.

286
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,580
I think there's definitely money in that.

287
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:43,140
But guys, I spent the first like year, I built websites and carpet cleaning, towing, landscaping.

288
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:47,140
Dude, I had like 20 different niches and guess what?

289
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:49,060
None of them were really working well.

290
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:52,780
And then as soon as I said, I'm just going to go in the boring niches, I started making

291
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:53,780
a lot of money.

292
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,140
No.

293
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,820
Pierre, I got a couple of questions for you.

294
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:02,140
And by the way, Pierre, they said they can barely hear you, so I need you to just make

295
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,140
your voice loud.

296
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,140
OK.

297
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,500
There you go.

298
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:10,620
Luis says, what do you think about hiring someone from Fiverr to get a concrete GMB

299
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,620
verified?

300
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,340
Is it for you or for me?

301
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:23,740
Well, he's asking for himself, but I think his real question is, would you recommend

302
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:24,740
doing it?

303
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:25,740
Would you do it?

304
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:26,740
I personally would not.

305
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:33,020
Actually, we're trying right now to find some GMB guys, but we are kind of making a world

306
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,020
hiring process.

307
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:39,180
So we are, I don't think we did Fiverr, it's Jeremy, my right hand, doing this.

308
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:43,100
But I think we're trying Upwork, Facebook groups, like all of those guys that know GMB

309
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,100
and actually they have some good techniques.

310
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:49,620
And the thing is, we just pay if the GMB sticks for 10 days, so you don't really take a risk.

311
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:53,940
But we are going to try a thousand, maybe hundreds to find a few guys that can open

312
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:54,940
GMB.

313
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:58,140
We had someone in France, but the system is not working anymore.

314
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:02,420
So anyway, I don't think Fiverr is the best place.

315
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:06,820
I think we have now, I don't know, 90, 100 GMB.

316
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:10,340
And now all of the Gmail accounts are kind of full of GMB.

317
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:13,260
Like now we need to kind of have a better process.

318
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:17,020
So we are looking to build a better process.

319
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:21,180
But I think if you're kind of on the first side, just do it yourself, do it with your

320
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:24,060
sister phone or your mom, whatever.

321
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,060
That's the best.

322
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,900
Shiva has a very good strategy for this with the Zoom call.

323
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,860
I don't know if you talk about it in your group.

324
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:35,580
It's like you do a Zoom call with someone, friends, family, whatever.

325
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:39,820
That is not so far from where you want to open the GMB and you do like a remote control

326
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,820
on Zoom, which you can do.

327
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:46,140
Then you can control the other person computer and you can open the GMB with their Gmail

328
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:51,340
account, which is clean and activate because the main problem is that either your Gmail

329
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:56,460
open 10 GMBs or Google instantly locks you because they know you are not a concrete guy,

330
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,460
which is going to open one and stop.

331
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:03,660
And also, if you create a new Gmail, Google is going to be like, OK, this is this is creepy.

332
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,980
It's probably some Indian dudes that is doing this in a row.

333
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:10,860
So you need a clean Gmail that is used by someone.

334
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,460
So just do it with your friends and family.

335
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:17,340
All of my friends and family had an open GMB in the first year or first two years.

336
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,020
I love that.

337
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:22,540
So in short, I don't think Fiverr.

338
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:23,340
I also agree.

339
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,860
I don't think Fiverr is the best place.

340
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:30,780
I like to use Fiverr if I need like a logo for five bucks for my GMB.

341
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,220
That's like what I use Fiverr for.

342
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:33,740
You know what I mean?

343
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:37,740
By the way, it's called Fiverr, but I don't think I've ever used.

344
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:41,660
I think I've ever bought anything that was only five dollars, ironically.

345
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:45,900
It's kind of like there's a store in the US called Dollar General, dude.

346
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,820
And nothing's nothing's a dollar.

347
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:55,420
OK, real quick, we have Stephanie.

348
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:02,540
Do companies in France pay for ads or are you are you finding people like

349
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:07,660
and second part of the question, do they usually pay for Google ads,

350
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:11,180
Yelp ads or Angie's List or the equivalent?

351
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:15,980
We don't have Yelp and Angie, but actually they are owned by the same guy,

352
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:19,340
which is worth five billion in the San Francisco Diary of Dealers,

353
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:25,900
something that on HomeAdvisor, he also on Expedia, Investopedia, Match.com,

354
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:29,420
so Tinder, Ingen, 45% of the dating app.

355
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:33,500
And he on HomeAdvisor and he also on Travel.com,

356
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,100
which is the equivalent in France.

357
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,940
He has in Italy, in Europe, like this guy is the king of Legion.

358
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:44,220
And so it's not HomeAdvisor, Angie's, but it's similar in France.

359
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:48,460
And yeah, they pay for all of this, actually.

360
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,420
It's exactly the same as the US.

361
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,780
They're going to pay for this and for us as well.

362
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,100
Sometimes they're going to stop what they did to pay us.

363
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:02,300
Sometimes they are a better deal to pay Angie's or like equivalent in France.

364
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,220
It's 100% the same.

365
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:07,980
I had also when I started this kind of fear that,

366
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:10,540
oh, they already pay for something, they're not going to pay for me,

367
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:13,260
but I think you're 200% right.

368
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:16,860
If they already pay for the lead, it's much easier to sell them.

369
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:17,900
100%.

370
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:24,620
So yeah, guys, if you guys are calling, I don't care if you're pre-selling

371
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,780
or if you're waiting for your website to rank.

372
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:30,460
Once you start getting leads, you should be talking to people

373
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:33,740
who are already paying for advertising, right?

374
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:37,740
Because they're already sold on advertising.

375
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:41,020
If I had a gym or I was trying to sell gym memberships,

376
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:44,700
I would be targeting people who went to the gym already

377
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,220
and then trying to get them to my gym.

378
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:49,580
I wouldn't be trying to convince people who don't believe in the gym

379
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,620
to come to my gym.

380
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:53,660
I would go target people who are interested in fitness

381
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,500
and already have that bill.

382
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,380
It just makes sense.

383
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,220
So don't just open up Google.

384
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:01,740
My very first deal, guys, it was a towing site.

385
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,820
Ironically, I sold that website to Shiv.

386
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,660
That's a totally different story.

387
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:10,780
But that website, as soon as the first lead came in,

388
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:11,820
I didn't know what I was doing.

389
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:15,740
I just went to Google and called the very first person that I could find.

390
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:19,180
And they didn't believe in paying for advertising.

391
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,580
So make sure you guys are targeting people paying for advertising.

392
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:27,740
Pierre, what's your biggest challenge in this right now, in this business?

393
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:32,060
So I have a sales background and I've seen your strategy work really well.

394
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:35,740
So it makes me save a lot of time or just go faster.

395
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:42,540
So my problem has kind of always been more the generating more leads, you know.

396
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:43,740
Okay.

397
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:46,060
Generating more leads, getting enough volume.

398
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:47,820
Yeah.

399
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:48,300
Okay.

400
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,660
Inventory, inventory.

401
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,100
Okay.

402
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:54,940
Daniel says, how much do you, this is for both of us.

403
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,340
This is for both of us.

404
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,140
You can answer first.

405
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:00,780
How much do you guys spend on Google Ads per month?

406
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,260
What's your cost per lead?

407
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,420
And how much do you charge the local businesses?

408
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:08,620
So I'll let you go first and I'll give my answer because you're in France.

409
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,180
I'm in the U.S.

410
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:13,340
I think we are at 5K a month in ads right now.

411
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:18,540
But we have some ads that are running and the guys are not paying us yet

412
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:20,700
because we started the same cycle.

413
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,140
So I would say maybe 12K.

414
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,980
I have maybe 4K of Google Ads.

415
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:29,420
Also, some guys I could lower it down, but they're referring to business.

416
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:33,260
They took other sites with me, some kind of supporting them with lead.

417
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:37,500
So I think we could be around 3K if I wanted to really milk it up.

418
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,220
And once again, SEO is ranking ads are going to go down.

419
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:45,420
So it's like probably like 30 to 40% for me.

420
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,780
Cost per lead depends on the niche.

421
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:52,540
I don't think it's really relevant, but in France, like gardening, stuff like that,

422
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,940
it's going to be 20 to 40.

423
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,380
Everything is going to be 100.

424
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,940
But I don't think it's really relevant.

425
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:01,900
You're just going to see how much you're going to sell them.

426
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,340
And what was the third question?

427
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:09,340
The second question was, do you know what your cost per lead is or do you track that?

428
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:14,860
Not clearly, but I just kind of look how much I spend a month,

429
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,940
how many leagues I get, how much I sell it.

430
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:19,260
Am I making 50% or more?

431
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:22,940
Yeah, I don't really look either or track it super close.

432
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:25,580
And then the last question is, what's your average

433
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,580
price that you charge your business owners?

434
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:33,740
800, but I have some deals that are like 200, some that are like 1,500.

435
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:39,180
I have some guys that I have like four or five sites with me and they pay me 2,000.

436
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,700
So it's really mixed.

437
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:43,580
And some it's 200 a month, but it's like organic.

438
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:46,380
I didn't talk with the guy for the like six, eight months.

439
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:49,100
I take it, but 2,400 a year.

440
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:52,060
You put it back in SEO, it's a pretty good return.

441
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:53,900
Why not?

442
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,940
Yeah, that's really good.

443
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,620
So I'll say real quick.

444
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:03,180
So Daniel, if we're talking about Google Ads, how much do I spend?

445
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,860
So let me break this down.

446
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:09,740
To get somebody on the phone to do a Zoom call, I spend between 100

447
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:14,620
and sometimes up to $400 to get somebody on a Zoom call to close them.

448
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:17,740
Some of you guys might be thinking that's crazy, but let me tell you.

449
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,500
I make my money back as soon as I close the deal.

450
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,580
Even if I spend $500, right?

451
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:27,500
You make the $1,000, you say it's $1,000 a month, they pay you the 1,000.

452
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,420
I just made my $400 back.

453
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:31,580
So guess who actually paid for the ads?

454
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,620
The business owner, not me, right?

455
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,140
So that's the way I look at it.

456
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:38,460
So that's what it cost me upfront.

457
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:43,900
And then usually per month, if I do really good at choosing the city and niche,

458
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:48,060
I only have to spend $10 a day, which is about $300 a month.

459
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:56,060
But I will go up to $20 a day, up to $600 per month, which some of you guys think is crazy.

460
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:59,660
By the way, my lowest deals are $1,000 a month typically.

461
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:03,340
So I'm not going to spend $600 if I'm only making $800.

462
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:06,540
But if I have a $1,000 deal, I'll spend up to 60%.

463
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:13,580
And again, what Pierre said, your margins are only going to get bigger, right?

464
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:17,180
As soon as you get ranking, you're going to be able to lower your ad cost

465
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,940
and you're going to make more money in your pocket.

466
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:21,200
Makes sense.

467
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:28,460
So honestly, in my opinion, guys, I think you should have a mix of both.

468
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:31,660
I think you should have some websites that you're ranking organically.

469
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:35,660
And there are those really good areas that you found that you're kind of keeping to yourself.

470
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:39,660
You're adding backlinks, you're adding content, you're doing the rankings little by little,

471
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:41,660
doing something every day, every week.

472
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,020
I think you should have some of those.

473
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:49,980
But I think if you guys are not using the strategy of pre-selling with Google Ads,

474
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:52,300
then I think that you're crazy.

475
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:58,940
Because you can literally get to the $12,000 mark way faster by doing it.

476
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:01,340
And you can let other people pay for the ads.

477
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,700
You're not paying for them yourself.

478
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,820
They're paying for the ads.

479
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:05,420
Makes sense?

480
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:07,980
And I think also that's important.

481
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:12,380
But I would say the most important, it gives you trust and confidence in the business.

482
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:15,820
When you get the strike pumping in, it's very different.

483
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:19,020
You don't sound the same on the phone, you know?

484
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:22,860
And there is a huge part about sales.

485
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:25,980
And sales is like building trust with contractors.

486
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:28,380
Contractors are getting spammed hardcore.

487
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,300
So you need to build trust with them.

488
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:34,060
And if you don't trust yourself that there are people paying you every month

489
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:38,700
and making money with your leads, it's going to be super hard.

490
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:41,900
For me, it probably happened the same for you, Nick.

491
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:45,500
But each deal becomes so much faster and faster and easier.

492
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,980
And you're just like, man, you don't take it all good next.

493
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:50,620
And you call the next guy and you're going again.

494
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:53,660
And then it's a volume game and you don't really have feelings anymore.

495
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:54,940
I don't know.

496
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:55,980
It's so much better.

497
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:00,380
Once you get the first deal, everything changes, to be honest with you.

498
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:04,380
OK, here's what I want to do really quick.

499
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,580
I'm going to give away some...

500
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:10,700
I said yesterday, if people put the word pre-selling on that post,

501
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:13,180
they would be entered to possibly win some swag.

502
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:15,100
So here's what I'm going to do.

503
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,260
We've got a couple of comments on here.

504
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,540
Let me go to all comments.

505
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,140
Let's see here.

506
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:28,380
OK, Shelly Xander said, pre-selling, I'll be on the call tomorrow.

507
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:31,100
Shelly Xander, if you're live on the call, make a comment, please.

508
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,140
Erwin, are you live?

509
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:37,180
And Joel Smith, are you live?

510
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:40,780
By the way, Stephanie Prather, send me a message.

511
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:42,700
Actually, I'm just going to do it on this call.

512
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:45,740
You're also a winner because you're at $11,900

513
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:50,940
and you passed my brother Porter in revenue, which I think is amazing.

514
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:52,540
Let's see.

515
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:59,980
So Stephanie, Joel, Erwin, and Shelly, who of you is online right now?

516
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:00,860
Shelly is live.

517
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,340
Shelly, I'm going to put this right now.

518
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:07,820
I just need you to go message Ashley De La Rosa.

519
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:09,660
You'll find her.

520
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:10,860
She's a friend of mine.

521
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:14,220
And tell her you won the t-shirt.

522
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:19,020
She'll send you a promo code and you can just put in the promo code

523
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,780
and it'll send it to your house for free.

524
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,340
So there's Shelly.

525
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,380
Who else is live?

526
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:26,060
Stephanie, are you still on?

527
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,020
We've got Stephanie.

528
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:30,540
Stephanie wants her DL hat.

529
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:33,260
Stephanie, I'm about to place another order of hats.

530
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:35,260
I don't even think I sell those on the store,

531
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:38,060
but I'll make sure that as soon as we place an order, I'll get you one.

532
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:41,900
So you can hold out for that.

533
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,020
Just remind me of that, okay?

534
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,700
Because we've got to get some of those.

535
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,460
And what she's talking about is this hat right here.

536
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,460
The digital landlords hat.

537
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,140
Shelly got it.

538
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,260
Joel's live as well.

539
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,460
Joel, same thing.

540
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,580
Message Ashley.

541
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,180
Tell her you won the t-shirt.

542
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:56,860
She'll check with me.

543
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,500
I'll see it come through as a notification.

544
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,740
I'll make sure that you actually did that.

545
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:06,460
Stephanie has the mug, mousepad, t-shirt.

546
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:09,340
Joel, Shelly, and then there was one more Irwin.

547
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:11,500
So let's see if Irwin's on as well.

548
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,020
And I'll send it to him.

549
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,140
And then also is Sadie Wilson on?

550
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,580
Sadie Wilson Tangelson.

551
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,300
Sadie, are you on live right now?

552
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:24,540
And by the way, guys, if you're on right now and you would rather,

553
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:27,260
we have these mousepads.

554
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:29,260
We have a coffee mug.

555
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,300
We have AirPods.

556
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,260
We have some other stuff.

557
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,540
You can trade it for that as well.

558
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:33,500
Don't worry.

559
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,460
So Sadie, if you're on, let me know in the chat.

560
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,420
Pierre, what's your goal by the end of the year?

561
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:47,900
1.25 per month on December.

562
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:48,400
10X.

563
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,060
I love that, dude.

564
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:51,020
Have you been reading that book?

565
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:55,740
No, but I mean, I read it a while ago, but I get it.

566
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,020
It's quite simple, man.

567
00:29:57,020 --> 00:30:02,140
10X is bigger, easier than 2X because then you kind of think differently than last year.

568
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:06,780
I mean, to do 2X now, it's so easy because we are already going to make, I don't know,

569
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:11,500
160, 180 this year without doing anything.

570
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,540
So it's like, just do more, you know?

571
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:18,700
And if I just do what I did last year, which is like three deals a month,

572
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,300
I'm already at 500K.

573
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:26,460
So it's when you do the number, actually, I cannot show because we don't have the webcam,

574
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:30,780
but I have all my numbers here and I can just see what's going on, you know?

575
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:35,740
For anyone that can't see, which is all of you, he's got a whiteboard right by his desk

576
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:37,900
and he's got all of his numbers lined out.

577
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:40,460
I have a notebook I carry with me, same thing.

578
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:43,820
So Pierre is going to 10X this year.

579
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:47,820
Guys, I know it sounds crazy when he says 125K per month,

580
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:50,540
but you have to remember that it's been done, right?

581
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:51,340
It's been done.

582
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:51,900
I've done it.

583
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:56,700
I went from 8,000 to 10,000 per month to 100,000 per month in eight months.

584
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:01,340
Ryan Dalton, another guy in my group, he's at $100,000 per month.

585
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,220
It's something that's very, very doable.

586
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:07,740
And the other thing I like, Pierre, is you're doing it in France,

587
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,420
which I think is really interesting.

588
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:14,060
It makes it kind of completely wide open as well.

589
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,460
Yes or no, because there is less smaller cities.

590
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,900
For me, it's really hard to judge.

591
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:22,540
Is it better or not to be in France or U.S.?

592
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:25,260
One very good part about France is since it's smaller,

593
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:29,500
I have a lot of referral, like 50% of my customers are from word of mouth.

594
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:35,740
And honestly, I think if I was optimizing for short term,

595
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,580
I would be making more money now,

596
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:40,860
but I really take care of my customers, oversell them.

597
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:44,460
As you can see behind me, this is all quotes that my customers sign.

598
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:46,940
We still have much more to put.

599
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:49,420
And I really care about my customers making money.

600
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:55,580
And that pays because then they pay more because they get more leads,

601
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,820
they want more sites, they bring their friends.

602
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:59,580
So that's part of the strategy.

603
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,900
That's why I think we can scale well this year.

604
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:06,460
And that's why I really focus more on the inventory and the team

605
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:09,500
to make sure we have enough leads because I know on the sales part,

606
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,300
I'm not really worried.

607
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:13,660
It's more about will I get enough leads when I build enough website,

608
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:16,540
GMB ads and stuff so we get enough leads.

609
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:18,300
I love that.

610
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:20,400
Okay.

611
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:25,100
Stephanie said, and by the way, real quick before I go on,

612
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,300
so just to clarify, Pierre,

613
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,700
you have all your customer testimonials on your wall.

614
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:33,180
It's not testimonials, it's quotes that they sign.

615
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:39,660
So if I look at them, it's like, this is one shop in Lyon in France.

616
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,660
It's like 5,000 euros.

617
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:44,380
And this is some tree service for 8,000 euros.

618
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:48,780
And like I just, when I'm on the closing call with a customer

619
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:50,860
and like, oh, I don't know if it's going to work for me.

620
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:55,340
I do like, I mean, bro, like it worked for all of those guys.

621
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,140
Why not for you?

622
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:56,460
You know?

623
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:56,940
I like that.

624
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:57,660
I like that a lot.

625
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:58,380
That's interesting.

626
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:58,780
That's cool.

627
00:32:59,340 --> 00:32:59,740
That's cool.

628
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,740
I saw it on Hormuzi.

629
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:05,420
He had this in his gym with all of the weight loss transformation before and after.

630
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,100
And I was like, what is it in our industry?

631
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,460
You know, and it's quote, man.

632
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,060
I like that a lot.

633
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:10,540
That's cool.

634
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:11,660
Okay, cool.

635
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:12,620
I've never even thought about that.

636
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:13,180
It's a good idea.

637
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:16,540
Stephanie says a year ago, I was selling credit card services,

638
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:18,060
no money, very hard to sell.

639
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,260
I was selling plasma.

640
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:21,100
Yeah, that's crazy.

641
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:21,900
That was a year ago.

642
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,500
Now she's now a year later.

643
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,940
She's at $12,000 a month.

644
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,580
She started rank and rent.

645
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:32,300
April 1st, 2024 in Shiv's group studied for two months.

646
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,220
I feel like there's another part of the story that's coming.

647
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:35,580
Is that?

648
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:35,820
Yeah.

649
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:41,740
So she started guys, April 1st, 2024 is when she officially started.

650
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:44,700
Hasn't even been a year in Shiv's group.

651
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:49,340
And then she joined into digital landlords in July.

652
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:51,020
I think it was like the last day of June.

653
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:55,820
So in, let's see, July, August, September, October, November, December,

654
00:33:55,820 --> 00:34:00,780
in seven months, she's got to $12,000 a month, $11,900.

655
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:06,140
So guys, to kind of wrap this up, I think a good business in this business,

656
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,740
this is the best business model on the internet,

657
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:10,540
but I think a healthy business should have some ranked,

658
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,980
some organically ranked sites.

659
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:15,180
You should be running some paid advertising to get deals up front

660
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:17,100
and you should be going all out.

661
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,540
You should be doubling down on this business.

662
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:22,060
By the way, Stephanie said her first deal that she got.

663
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,500
So by the way, it took her a minute.

664
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,180
Her first deal she got was November.

665
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:27,740
So it took her July, August, September, October,

666
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:31,260
took her four or five months to get her first deal doing this strategy.

667
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,860
And now she's absolutely crushing it.

668
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:35,980
So guys, appreciate you hopping on the call.

669
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:38,620
I'm going to drop something if you guys want to check it out.

670
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:39,500
No pressure at all.

671
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,340
I have two resources for you.

672
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:44,060
I'll give you one resource and then one other thing.

673
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:47,980
But if you guys go to rentsimplesites.com,

674
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:52,620
you guys can learn more about the pre-selling strategy that we actually offer

675
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:54,860
and that we teach.

676
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:59,100
It's a quick, it's like seven videos, five minutes long.

677
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,260
You can buzz through it in 30, 40 minutes.

678
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:04,620
That'll give you a better idea of the overall strategy that we use.

679
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:08,380
And there's a bunch of people that are in this program

680
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:11,260
that I also work with inside of Digital Landlords.

681
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:13,500
So if you see that that's something interesting,

682
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:16,940
you can follow the steps there and find an application and see if it's a good fit.

683
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,860
But anyway, Pierre, thanks for joining, bro.

684
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,220
When am I going to see you back in Dubai?

685
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,820
When are we going to hang out in Dubai again, dude?

686
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:28,140
Just before that, highly recommend going on the course, guys.

687
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:31,740
It was super high return on investment for me.

688
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:36,700
And I knew how to sell, but it still makes my life so much easier.

689
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:39,260
I don't know if I would have quit because I was committed,

690
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:45,260
but it made it, I don't know, smooth enough so that I would step by step stack win.

691
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:47,260
And now it's so enjoyable to do this.

692
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:52,540
It's, I don't know, just a super great system and sales recipe.

693
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:54,300
So I highly recommend it.

694
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,100
I appreciate that.

695
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:58,540
We just had somebody, this kid that I, I'll say this to end.

696
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:06,380
I just had this kid that I grew, I went to school with this kid back 10, 15 years ago, right?

697
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:07,420
Went to high school with him.

698
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,740
He's been watching my posts.

699
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:11,020
He's been, he's whatever.

700
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:14,460
He saw my brother that, yeah.

701
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:17,180
So, so he just joined, his name's Dakota.

702
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:20,460
And he had a tree, he actually, instead of doing this,

703
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:22,860
he came out of high school, didn't go to college.

704
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:24,300
He started of all things.

705
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,340
Guess what he started?

706
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:27,500
A tree service company, right?

707
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:31,260
I even tried to sell this guy leads when I first started this.

708
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,780
He didn't want it, whatever.

709
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,380
So he messages me last Friday.

710
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:37,740
He's like, dude, I'm going to have to get a back operation.

711
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:40,060
He's like, I might not be able to do tree service.

712
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:41,660
I should have done this two years ago.

713
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:43,420
I should have started generating leads.

714
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:47,260
Anyway, he jumps on the call with us and you know what we asked him?

715
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:50,220
I always ask people this when they jump on the call to get into my program.

716
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:52,380
I always ask them, I say, why don't you just do this on your own?

717
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,380
You know, I send it back on them.

718
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:54,620
Do this.

719
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:55,660
Why don't you just do it on your own?

720
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:58,300
And I think that's a good question to ask your business owners, guys.

721
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,580
Why don't you do this on your own?

722
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:02,540
Because they're going to sell themselves on why they should work with you, right?

723
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:05,660
So I asked him this question, you know what he said?

724
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:13,020
He said, if somebody would have told me two years ago to buy a pole saw,

725
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:17,660
a pole saw is the thing with the pole that has the saw on the end that like extends out.

726
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:21,980
He's like, if somebody would have told me two years ago to buy a pole saw,

727
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:25,340
I would have made literally over a hundred thousand dollars.

728
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:26,380
I just didn't know.

729
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:30,060
So he's like, he's like, I'm not doing that again.

730
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:33,340
I'm going to go in and learn from people that are already making the money I want to make

731
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:36,620
and have them tell me the things to do and not to do.

732
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:39,820
Because I've already tried to do this on my own in my own business.

733
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:42,860
And I lost, I missed out on a bunch of money.

734
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:45,740
So guys, sometimes that's why you guys are in here with Shiv.

735
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:50,300
And that's the reason I'm in here with Shiv is there's things that he's figured out

736
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:55,820
that he can teach you in five minutes or in an hour on a video that's going to make you

737
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:59,900
a hundred thousand dollars or is going to save you a hundred thousand dollars.

738
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:03,020
So quit trying to do stuff on your own and quit trying to reinvent the wheel.

739
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:05,580
That's my only advice, but anything you want to add?

740
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:07,740
Yeah, man.

741
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:10,780
Talking about Shiv, Shiv is like crazy genius, man.

742
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:17,500
He was making online money at 13 or 16 or he never talked about this because he's like super humble

743
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:23,660
and he just focused on helping a student and people in the group, but he's super smart.

744
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:28,620
And we live in a crazy era where he has this scalability of helping multiple people at the

745
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:30,540
same time so we can have access to him.

746
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,460
But I think overall, he would just not care.

747
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:35,820
You know, he would be at other business level, same as you, man.

748
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:40,460
Like, I think you are one of the guys that had the craziest sales experience door to door.

749
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:43,820
You cannot transform it online, which makes you super unique.

750
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:47,260
I mean, for me, I'm super bullish on investing in yourself.

751
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:51,100
And that's always where I make my best return on investment.

752
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:52,380
For sure.

753
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:53,580
I 100% agree with that.

754
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:56,220
So, well, dude, Pierre, thanks for jumping on, guys.

755
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:57,180
We apologize.

756
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:59,740
You couldn't see, you couldn't see here.

757
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,220
For another time.

758
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,820
We'll keep the mystery, man.

759
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:06,060
Yeah, no, everyone's like, who's this Pierre guy?

760
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,100
Maybe it's just AI.

761
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,180
He isn't a real person, guys.

762
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,820
That's the new AI voice.

763
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:13,100
Yeah, exactly.

764
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:17,580
If you guys are on this call right now and you want the actual replay of this,

765
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:20,300
where you can see both of us and you can see Pierre,

766
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:22,060
we're going to let the mystery out of the box.

767
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,300
Send me a message on Facebook.

768
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:27,740
I'll upload this to Vimeo and I'll send you guys a link.

769
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,020
So, Pierre, thanks for jumping on, bro.

770
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:31,740
Hopefully, I'll see you in Dubai or I'll come to Thailand.

771
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:35,660
We'll send it again on a Tuesday, you know?

772
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:39,900
We need to talk still anyway.

773
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:42,380
Anyway, we'll see you guys next week.

774
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:43,980
Thanks, bro.
