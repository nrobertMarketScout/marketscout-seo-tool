WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
I

00:10.520 --> 00:16.320
Heard over and over and over and over and over in the first couple of trainings that I took and I've bought a lot

00:16.320 --> 00:18.080
Of programs have taken a lot of courses

00:18.080 --> 00:24.340
I kept hearing the same thing the riches are in the niches the riches are in the niches Nick

00:24.340 --> 00:27.160
You've got to find some crazy niche that you know

00:27.160 --> 00:30.200
no one's ever thought of it's it's you know, and I heard niches like

00:31.480 --> 00:33.280
Let's think of a couple examples

00:33.280 --> 00:38.960
Well drilling and chicken coop building and just these crazy things and feng shui feng shui

00:38.960 --> 00:42.040
Whatever that one is and I thought in order for me to be successful

00:42.040 --> 00:44.040
I had to find some crazy niche that no one had ever

00:44.120 --> 00:49.480
You know thought about tapped into whatever and then I was gonna just take it vertical and I was gonna make millions dollars

00:49.480 --> 00:51.480
that's what I thought okay, and

00:51.640 --> 00:56.640
What I realized is that although I know you can make money doing that

00:56.680 --> 00:58.680
I know people that have I

00:59.040 --> 01:04.880
Also know and this is how I made my money is you can also make your money by going into boring

01:05.600 --> 01:09.080
Regular niches that you've already thought of that you've already heard of that work

01:09.400 --> 01:14.820
We know they work because other people are making money in them and you focus on finding cities

01:15.560 --> 01:17.960
That are untouched, right?

01:17.960 --> 01:20.880
So instead of obscure niche its obscure city

01:20.880 --> 01:25.160
And so what I argue is instead of the riches are in the niches

01:25.160 --> 01:29.320
I believe the riches are actually in the cities

01:29.680 --> 01:34.400
So what you need to realize is as you're going through and we're gonna pick our niche in this section first of all

01:34.400 --> 01:38.940
We're not gonna overthink this because a lot of people get hung up wouldn't it should I go into oh my gosh

01:39.120 --> 01:42.640
You know the world's ending. I don't want to make the wrong move. No, we're not gonna do that

01:42.640 --> 01:49.120
Okay, but you either need to go into a really obscure niche that you can then go into most any city because no one's done it

01:49.120 --> 01:54.160
Or you do what I did which is you go into some regular niches that we know work

01:54.200 --> 01:57.160
okay, and I'm gonna go into some of those are getting a couple of examples and

01:57.800 --> 02:05.640
You take these regular niches and you spend your time finding cities that nobody has thought of heard of or would even

02:05.880 --> 02:13.160
Consider going into but you know because I'm gonna teach you that this this this and this all match up and you are going

02:13.160 --> 02:14.600
To have success. Okay

02:14.600 --> 02:20.640
So you need either need to pick an obscure city and a regular niche or an obscure niche

02:20.640 --> 02:23.000
And then you can go into regular cities

02:23.000 --> 02:23.520
All right

02:23.520 --> 02:27.720
so it's when it comes to niching there's a couple of criteria that you need to look at and that I

02:27.920 --> 02:31.040
Really really really really strongly feel that need to happen

02:31.040 --> 02:31.920
so

02:31.920 --> 02:39.080
Number one is the niche that you select needs to be medium to high ticket now the way that I define this is

02:40.480 --> 02:45.800
Where oh by the way, we're talking about what the customer charges to the the homeowner

02:45.840 --> 02:52.820
Okay, so customer goes in your customer goes in talks to the homeowner performs the service performs the job

02:52.920 --> 02:56.480
What did they charge that needs to be medium to high ticket?

02:56.480 --> 03:02.540
So I would consider medium to high ticket at the bare minimum a thousand dollars. Okay gross

03:02.600 --> 03:06.000
So they're charging the right in an invoice for a thousand bucks up to

03:06.920 --> 03:09.480
1015 K and I'm not gonna go too deep into this

03:09.480 --> 03:14.920
But I actually don't like it to go much past that because then we get into a long sales cycle

03:14.920 --> 03:16.920
And it's a little bit more difficult to do

03:17.440 --> 03:22.480
However, I would err on the high side rather than the low side and it's very simple

03:22.480 --> 03:28.280
The reason that we do this is if the customer can charge high prices to their customers the homeowners

03:28.600 --> 03:30.600
There's gonna be more money

03:31.080 --> 03:33.520
For us to charge higher retainers

03:33.520 --> 03:40.800
It's also gonna be easier for us to justify a higher ticket price when we go and charge them monthly or weekly for our service

03:40.800 --> 03:41.880
Okay

03:41.880 --> 03:46.600
Second thing when we're talking about niche criteria is there has to be good demand

03:46.600 --> 03:50.640
There has to be good volume and what I mean by that is there has to be a certain amount of people

03:51.320 --> 03:56.040
Actually searching for that service in that city. Okay, because for example

03:56.760 --> 03:59.720
Let's take the niche artificial grass, which actually is a really good niche

03:59.720 --> 04:05.560
It's one I'm gonna I'm gonna explain here in a moment that niche is excellent in some cities

04:05.680 --> 04:08.200
but if you were to type in artificial grass in

04:08.680 --> 04:13.760
For example the city that I grew up in which is this not even a city it's a little town first of all

04:13.760 --> 04:15.920
There's not you know that many people there. But secondly

04:16.880 --> 04:19.680
People there don't spend that much money on their yards

04:19.680 --> 04:25.120
And so if you started looking at the metrics you would quickly see there is not that many searches

04:25.120 --> 04:29.920
There's not that much demand for artificial grass in the city. In fact, I don't know one person in the city

04:29.920 --> 04:32.120
I grew up that has artificial grass. I can't think of one house

04:32.760 --> 04:35.280
So we do need to make sure there is

04:35.760 --> 04:40.000
Good demand good search volume. I'm gonna show you how to do that. Don't stress about it

04:40.040 --> 04:44.280
The third thing is there needs to be no brand loyalty

04:44.280 --> 04:48.760
What I mean by that is with let's take a niche like concrete

04:48.760 --> 04:55.360
Okay, when I got my concrete done, I extended my pool deck. This is last summer. I

04:56.560 --> 05:01.240
Went in and I looked at well, this is actually a little bit different for me because I had some clients

05:01.240 --> 05:06.000
But I went and got a couple of estimates. Okay, and I did not check if they had a license

05:06.000 --> 05:10.800
I didn't have them send me previous projects. I didn't like I didn't care about any of that

05:10.800 --> 05:14.640
I just said hey and I had one of them was my client. I had him come give me a bid

05:14.640 --> 05:16.640
I had a couple other people give me bids. I

05:17.320 --> 05:22.320
Didn't care what they're I didn't even know what the company LLC was called or their their business, right?

05:22.520 --> 05:26.360
So we want those type of niches because when we build a site

05:26.960 --> 05:30.640
That is branded very generically right or unbranded

05:31.320 --> 05:34.040
We want to be able to make sure that people are still gonna call us

05:34.040 --> 05:37.600
So an example of this is like for for like solar

05:38.280 --> 05:43.360
Solar panels, right if you're gonna put solar on your house, you're going to check out who the company is

05:43.360 --> 05:45.680
You're gonna check out the reviews. You're gonna want to see the projects

05:45.680 --> 05:50.040
They've done you want to see the license and this then blah blah blah blah, because that's a huge business

05:51.160 --> 05:57.000
It's a big commitment. So that for example is a niche that is very brand loyal

05:57.000 --> 06:01.680
So just to recap on those two things number one is you want to make sure it's medium to high ticket

06:02.200 --> 06:07.400
You want to make sure there is good volume and you want to make sure there is no brand loyalty

06:07.400 --> 06:07.800
All right

06:07.800 --> 06:13.360
Let me give you some good examples of good niches that I would recommend going into and some examples of bad niches

06:13.360 --> 06:14.720
So good examples

06:14.720 --> 06:16.240
Concrete and these are all by the way

06:16.240 --> 06:21.120
I don't give you examples unless I've made money concrete one of my favorite niches tree service great niche

06:21.400 --> 06:24.680
artificial grass awesome niche spray foam insulation awesome niche

06:25.560 --> 06:31.160
Masonry block wall awesome niche. I'm trying to think if there's anything else comes to my mind

06:32.960 --> 06:38.840
Duck cleaning is is kind of in that gray area. It's a little bit too low ticket. I won't do duck cleaning anymore

06:38.840 --> 06:44.560
It's not terrible. You could probably sneak, you know a decent sized deal, but it's it's an okay niche

06:44.560 --> 06:46.720
I don't love it. Okay

06:47.520 --> 06:51.240
bad examples, okay, so those are good ones bad ones

06:52.240 --> 06:58.280
Dentistry, okay anything like medical like that because people are gonna want to have some brand loyalty solar

06:59.040 --> 07:02.600
Okay, these two I'm gonna share might shock you a little bit roofing

07:03.680 --> 07:09.280
Roofing is pretty brand-loyal. There's so much money in roofing that people are spending ridiculous amounts of money on advertising

07:09.600 --> 07:14.640
They're buying billboards. They got custom wraps in their cars and I'll bet you as you're watching this

07:14.640 --> 07:18.000
There's probably one person if you think who's the roofing boss in my town

07:18.680 --> 07:20.680
There's somebody that comes to mind

07:20.680 --> 07:23.360
Whereas with concrete there's not really like, you know

07:24.040 --> 07:30.560
The guy or the company the girl that's out there. That's like that's the the concrete person, you know

07:30.560 --> 07:33.800
It's there's very little brand loyalty. So dentistry

07:34.520 --> 07:36.280
roofing solar

07:36.280 --> 07:41.200
Another one I found to be very difficult as HVAC. That's a pretty brand loyal deal

07:42.200 --> 07:45.160
Electrician for whatever reason has been not great

07:45.160 --> 07:50.280
So good ones tree service spray from insulation concrete, etc bad ones

07:51.520 --> 07:54.360
Dentistry anything medical roofing solar

07:55.200 --> 07:59.880
Whatever. Now one little caveat is if you're gonna look at a niche like roofing don't do it

08:00.080 --> 08:07.200
However, I have made a decent amount of money in roof repair because it's more niche more niche

08:07.400 --> 08:12.120
More whatever you want to call it then roofing not as many people want to go after it

08:12.120 --> 08:16.960
not as many people care because they're just coming to fix a tile or coming to fix this or that and so those are

08:16.960 --> 08:18.600
The good examples was the bad example

08:18.600 --> 08:24.840
So guys I'm gonna show you a couple of examples of some niches that I have gone into and made some money

08:25.120 --> 08:27.840
Some decent amounts of money in these niches. So

08:28.440 --> 08:30.440
First one is tree service

08:31.080 --> 08:33.560
As you can see st. George tree service

08:33.920 --> 08:37.200
I'm actually what's interesting about this one is I have made over

08:38.240 --> 08:42.960
$20,000 in this specific niche and this specific city. So this website, okay, and

08:44.400 --> 08:48.040
What's interesting is I'm not even ranked number one. I'm ranked one two

08:49.440 --> 08:56.400
I'm ranked number six. Okay. Here's my website. I'm ranked number six website doesn't look that great

08:56.400 --> 08:58.600
I've made over $20,000 here. Okay

08:59.520 --> 09:02.520
incredible, okay that this blows me away my

09:03.240 --> 09:08.560
What's even more fascinating is my GMB. I do have a GMB. It's verified for whatever reason

09:08.560 --> 09:13.440
We just can't seem to put it in the maps. It kind of you know ebbs and flows, but we're still making money

09:13.440 --> 09:19.080
We're making a thousand dollars plus per month for the last couple years. So I'm not complaining

09:19.080 --> 09:22.720
okay, another one that I mentioned as a good example was concrete and

09:23.640 --> 09:31.040
We have you know made a good chunk of change in this niche as well. So st. George concrete st. George concrete

09:33.000 --> 09:39.400
And here you have it. Okay this outside same format. We did get some nice photos taken and

09:40.520 --> 09:45.680
That's it. So those are just a couple of examples. I love concrete. I love spray foam insulation

09:45.680 --> 09:47.680
I love tree service as I mentioned and

09:48.760 --> 09:50.400
You don't need to overthink this guys

09:50.400 --> 09:55.640
What I want you to do is in this module and actually before you move on to the next lesson

09:55.640 --> 09:58.200
I need you to pick a

09:58.720 --> 10:03.720
Niche, okay, and I don't want you to overthink it and I don't want you to spend a week on this

10:03.720 --> 10:08.360
I don't even want you to spend a day on this and I'm gonna tell you right now if you're somebody that's like

10:08.560 --> 10:11.680
Analysis paralysis you're gonna hesitate you're gonna overthink it

10:11.680 --> 10:19.200
I'm gonna just go ahead and tell you pick concrete pick concrete right now pick that niche because it's amazing. It works

10:20.160 --> 10:24.080
I've made tons and tons and tons of money and think about it every city

10:24.080 --> 10:27.560
I don't care where you grew up what village I grew up in what I would consider a village

10:27.600 --> 10:33.200
It's still there was still concrete that people needed concrete. We had we lived on a you know, whatever slab

10:33.200 --> 10:36.320
We had a concrete driveway concrete sidewalk. Everybody needs concrete

10:36.320 --> 10:40.000
So if you're hesitating and you don't know and like oh my gosh, what niche should I use?

10:40.040 --> 10:43.160
What should I go into first do concrete?
