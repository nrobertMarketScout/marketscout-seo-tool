1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
I think that a lot of the initial, so there's a thing I don't know what the term is. I call it

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:13,840
like a card quality issue. So I would say do not use any type of debit card issued by a bank

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,040
because I think I said it in a video or something that I posted a group.

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:27,520
When you go and do that initial charge, it's coming from overseas. It's not coming from the

5
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:32,880
United States. So if you're here and you're doing a charge wherever it's coming from,

6
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:40,240
it could send a block. Now, they're so fast that as soon as they feel that, done, suspicious payment.

7
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:46,240
They don't give you that. It's done so fast that you don't get like that. Today I got one on my

8
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:52,160
phone for my AAH ref's charge. So every five or six months, I get a thing and they're like,

9
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,840
hey, are you approving this? And I'm thinking like, yeah, no shit, it's a recurring payment.

10
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,760
But for whatever reason, every five or six months, my credit card company makes sure

11
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,360
that I approved it. But it's because it's coming from out of country.

12
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,640
But with Google, it happens so fast that you get flagged right away and then there's nobody to talk

13
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:16,640
to because there's nobody answering those phones. So if you have a debit card, those have a lot

14
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,400
because that's protecting your cash right now. So they're going to have a more scrutiny on the

15
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,720
security features with it. So that's one thing I've told a couple of students, like I wouldn't use

16
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,360
your debit card.
