For those of you that are like,

00:01.320 --> 00:03.640
hey, the leads are a little bit slow,

00:03.640 --> 00:05.320
whatever, whatever, whatever,

00:05.320 --> 00:08.680
here's my go-to, this is what I like to do is,

00:08.680 --> 00:10.280
during the first contract,

00:10.280 --> 00:11.320
and I think I covered this last week,

00:11.320 --> 00:13.280
if there's six-month contract,

00:13.280 --> 00:16.760
I am doing a touch, a check-in with them

00:16.760 --> 00:20.360
every single week during the first contract.

00:20.360 --> 00:22.080
If it's six-month contract,

00:22.080 --> 00:25.200
I am touching base with them 24 times, okay?

00:25.200 --> 00:28.240
And of those 24 times, at least once a month,

00:28.240 --> 00:29.680
I'm doing a Zoom call,

00:29.720 --> 00:32.560
and we are going over the leads, okay?

00:32.560 --> 00:34.400
We're gonna send them the leads,

00:34.400 --> 00:36.040
I'm gonna say, hey, let's jump on a Zoom,

00:36.040 --> 00:38.720
I'm gonna say, which one of these leads did you talk to?

00:38.720 --> 00:41.200
Have you talked to Jack, did you talk to Mark,

00:41.200 --> 00:42.840
did you talk to Zane?

00:42.840 --> 00:46.240
Cool, did you schedule them for an estimate?

00:46.240 --> 00:48.640
Awesome, did you give them a quote?

00:48.640 --> 00:51.800
Great, did you follow up with the quote?

00:51.800 --> 00:53.280
Beautiful, okay?

00:53.280 --> 00:56.480
Okay, I sent you 20 leads and you gotta hold the two?

00:56.480 --> 00:59.560
Well, Jack, how the fuck are you gonna make money?

00:59.600 --> 01:00.720
How are you gonna make money

01:00.720 --> 01:03.680
by talking to two people I'm sending you 20, okay?

01:03.680 --> 01:05.600
So you have to do these soft touches.

01:06.520 --> 01:08.400
So that's my advice, if things are a little bit slow,

01:08.400 --> 01:10.680
things have been a little bit weird with the deal,

01:10.680 --> 01:12.280
you're gonna have to be over,

01:12.280 --> 01:13.520
you're gonna have to over-communicate.

01:13.520 --> 01:15.560
I would recommend a touch every single week,

01:15.560 --> 01:16.600
and then once a month,

01:16.600 --> 01:19.440
I would be jumping on a Zoom call reviewing the leads.

01:19.440 --> 01:21.120
But at the end of the day, even that,

01:21.120 --> 01:23.200
that's just gonna buy you a little bit of time.

01:23.200 --> 01:25.400
The short answer, the right answer,

01:25.400 --> 01:28.800
if they don't make money, they will cancel,

01:28.800 --> 01:30.680
and it might be tomorrow, it might be next month,

01:30.680 --> 01:32.360
it might be next week, it might be in six months,

01:32.360 --> 01:34.520
it might be in two years,

01:34.520 --> 01:36.960
because they just don't keep track of their budget.

01:36.960 --> 01:38.960
If the customer does not make money,

01:38.960 --> 01:42.080
even if it's not your fault, they will cancel.
