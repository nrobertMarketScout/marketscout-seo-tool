1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
out. Okay, I think it's working on my head too. Guys, heads

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,760
up. Welcome to call final live how to get to if I was starting

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:13,040
over today, how I would get from zero to $20,000 as quickly as

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,200
possible. Appreciate you guys being on. It's 104am for me in

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,880
West Africa. But your boy, he took a shower. He's looking

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,640
fresh. He's ready to go. I told you I'd come prepared for this.

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,640
I've been working on this for a long time. Super stoked to have

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,360
you guys on. I really appreciate you being on. But I am in

9
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,080
Africa. So there's a chance my internet goes out. If that

10
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,320
happens, please stay on the live. Porter's going to be able

11
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,920
to be the co host. I'll hop right back on. If the power goes

12
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,520
out, the generator will kick on. But there's going to be a

13
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,280
little little gap. Please stay on and I'm going to give you

14
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,240
some reasons why we're going to be giving away it just for

15
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,920
staying on this live till the end. Number one thing we're

16
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,520
going to be doing is giving you guys a replay. This is not

17
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,560
going to stay up obviously in the free group because that's

18
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,440
changing. But if you stay on this live till the end, you're

19
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,600
going to get a replay of this live today, which I hope you

20
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,120
guys take and watch again and again. You dissect it. You take

21
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,480
notes, everything else. So please stay on that. We're also

22
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,840
going to be doing our giveaways. We've got a bunch of stuff

23
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,360
we're going to be giving away. So stay till the end. I'm going

24
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,600
to pack the training, going to make this really a value field

25
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,040
and we're going to try to end this in 55 minutes. I also want

26
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,400
to let you guys know, you know, what the what the transition is

27
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:29,600
because the free group is no more. OK, so Porter, you could

28
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,560
still hear me. We're good where everything's good. Yep, we're

29
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,760
good. OK, I want you to monitor the comments. I've also got

30
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,680
Ashley watching live because when we do the giveaways, I want

31
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,120
her to take notes, even though she isn't on this live that you

32
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,280
can see. She's there. She's watching about a whole team

33
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:50,200
watching. So, guys, let's get into it. This group, the Art of

34
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,120
Digital Real Estate. And by the way, it was called the Art of

35
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,680
Pre-selling before. As you guys know it right now, it will never

36
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,600
be the same as of today. OK, but today I'm going to show you

37
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,680
guys where it's going and how you can be a part of it, too, if

38
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,280
you choose. But we're also going to be doing the training. That's

39
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,440
the main thing is the training, the giveaways. But I do want to

40
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,680
let you guys know where this is going, because this is not going

41
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:15,760
to be the same as it was this morning. OK, so in addition to

42
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,280
the training, guys, here's what we're going to be doing. We're

43
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,040
going to be giving away two to two different people. We're

44
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,760
going to be giving away three free months of three free a

45
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,080
three free month membership to Rankin and Ningen. We're going to

46
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,240
be giving away five copies of a 12 part exclusive training

47
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,960
series that I did a few months back. We had some amazing

48
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:39,080
topics. One of the one of the trainings, we had some

49
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,720
incredible feedback. People, to my knowledge, people actually

50
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,120
made money from this specific training. So there's 12. It's

51
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,600
like 12 hours long. You're going to get we've got five

52
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,560
different people are going to get copies of that. We're going

53
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,160
to give away 10 pieces of merchandise, coffee mugs, t

54
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,520
shirts, mouse pads. And then guys, we're also going to give

55
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:59,640
away one, not a full but a partial scholarship to digital

56
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:04,400
landlords. OK. Also, just as a reminder, anybody that stays

57
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,680
till the end of this training is going to get a copy of this

58
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,400
training. I'm going to let you know how to do that. We got to

59
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,720
stay till the end to get those instructions. Again, guys, 53

60
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,120
minutes. We're going to buzz through this as quickly as

61
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,280
possible. Guys, it's been an amazing ride. It's been over 150

62
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,160
plus weeks of me pouring my heart and soul into this group.

63
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,400
And I literally mean that. OK, let me give you guys really,

64
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,720
really quick. Just a quick background on this group. OK, I

65
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:36,240
started it back in September of 2021. This was after I had my

66
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,120
very, you know, I had my first year of making seven figures

67
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:43,560
renting simple websites in 2020. Then I had another year. We did

68
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:49,640
like 1.4, 1.45 in 2021. And guys, what ended up happening is

69
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,440
I was sharing my journey, which I encourage you guys to do the

70
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,320
same. I was in other groups. I was sharing my journey in this

71
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,440
specific group. And I started getting people that would send

72
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,200
me messages. They would say, you know, Nick, how did you close

73
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,760
this deal up front? How did you, you know, Nick, how did you

74
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,600
scale to 100, 100K? That's insane. I didn't know anyone

75
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,960
could do that. Nick, my business owner keeps complaining about

76
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,000
the price. What is it? All these different questions. And at the

77
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
time, I didn't, you know, I had never had this happen. So it was

78
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,680
kind of fun. It was exciting. I felt I felt like my ego was

79
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,480
stroked a bit. And so two to three times a week, I would

80
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,920
spend after my day was done. It was I remember it was at

81
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,160
nighttime. My kids were asleep. I would spend 30 to 60 minutes

82
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,080
in the evening, opening the messages, turning on the camera,

83
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,560
responding to them directly. OK. But guys, eventually, I started

84
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,640
getting the same questions again and again and again. And I

85
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,480
realized, you know, I'm doing this is being I'm being stupid.

86
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,320
Let me put everybody in a free group. And then when the

87
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,200
question is asked, I'll just answer it once. And then

88
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,080
everybody can come and they can they can look at the answer,

89
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,120
right? Three years from now, you guys can go and look at answers

90
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,480
and questions that were asked three years ago. And that was

91
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,640
the entire goal. And so that's exactly what I did, guys. Three

92
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:01,400
over three years, three years and five months ago. And I

93
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,760
remember, guys, like I was doing everything at the beginning, I

94
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,280
was answering all the questions. I was also running my agency. I

95
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,960
was going live. I was doing all this kind of stuff. And I was

96
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,200
literally responding to every single question. I wouldn't let

97
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,480
a single notification pass by. So if you guys have ever heard of

98
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:20,960
Fix It Felix, our our admin, which does a phenomenal job. I

99
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,840
was Fix It Felix. OK, then we had somebody that came in and

100
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,520
helped. And then I hired somebody to help. But I was

101
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,640
Fix It Felix in the beginning. And that's just that's just how

102
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:32,080
it was. And it was it was super exciting. But it just wasn't

103
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,760
scalable. OK, guys, I've gone live over 150 times in this

104
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,080
group, sharing everything that I know and holding nothing back.

105
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,240
But what I've realized is as time has gone on, guys, I've

106
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,800
seen that people they've stopped appreciating what I'm doing.

107
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,360
And I'm not saying I need to be appreciated. But the sizzle is

108
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,800
gone. You know, when you send a business owner, Porter, you

109
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,240
know what I'm talking about? You send a business owner, those

110
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,520
first couple leads are super stoked. And then if you let it

111
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,840
go on too long, they kind of get entitled. Can't send them too

112
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,160
many. You can't send them too many. Right. People stop showing

113
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,440
up to the lives, guys. And I tried all kinds of stuff. I tried

114
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,000
to do them on Zoom. I tried to do a cap to number all kinds of

115
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,680
different stuff. And what I've just seen is a lot of people

116
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,320
have just become parasites, not producers. And I'm not speaking

117
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,640
to all of you, but a lot of people that has happened to. And

118
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:21,600
so, guys, I want I want to ask you guys, some of you guys are

119
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,880
going to be a little bit. I think I even had an Instagram

120
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,600
message from somebody that I had been talking to. In fact,

121
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,400
somebody that had been on one of the lives with us asked a

122
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,040
question. He's like, well, blah, blah, blah. You're changing the

123
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:36,040
group. And I didn't just rub me wrong. And I said, dude, same

124
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,600
thing. Guys, if you're sending a business owner free leads, OK,

125
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,080
you guys talk about, hey, we're going to have a conversation.

126
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,800
I'm going to send you free leads, blah, blah, blah, blah,

127
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,200
blah. You send them three to five leads. You hop on a sales

128
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,400
call. You do the whole process and they tell you, you know

129
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:55,560
what? I think I can do this better on my own or I don't think

130
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,080
I need to pay you. I can just do it on my own. OK, we've all had

131
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,080
that happen. Porter, have you had that happen? Yeah. And it's

132
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,440
going to happen again. But the question is, are you going to

133
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:09,360
keep giving that person free leads? Obviously not. Right.

134
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,800
You're not going to do that. You're going to stop sending them

135
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,400
leads. So that's that's what this is, guys. That's all that

136
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,840
this is. But this isn't the what I'm doing, the value that I'm

137
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,840
giving me going live, all this content. It's going to a new

138
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,720
home. But it trust me, this is not going away. It's just

139
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,480
changing. OK, so guys, of course, you wouldn't give it to

140
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,160
them. You want you you would say, OK, good luck, go try it

141
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,200
out. And then once they go and try it out on their own, they're

142
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:38,200
going to come back and say, hey, yeah, those leads, what do

143
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,720
we got to do to work together? Right. They're going to

144
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:44,120
appreciate it because now it's gone. OK, so, guys, basically

145
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:49,080
what I'm saying is the days of free ninety nine, it's done.

146
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:54,920
OK, the the gravy train is over. You don't value what you don't

147
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:58,240
pay for. I have a thirty thousand dollar program that

148
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,440
somebody gave me the password to just to go and look at not even

149
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,040
the material, but how they structured it. It is sitting.

150
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,080
I have the password. I have it bookmarked. It is sitting there.

151
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,600
I have spent less than 30 minutes in it because I didn't pay

152
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,640
for it. And that's just what happens. OK, guys, I don't care

153
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,960
what the number of this group is. I know we have six point two

154
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,720
thousand members. Who cares? I don't care if after this live, we

155
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,080
go from six thousand two hundred people to 30 people, because

156
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,560
those 30 people that I'm still seeing are the people that I

157
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,520
want to work with, the people that are serious to the people

158
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,560
that are actually going to take action. OK, so here's the deal.

159
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,320
As of one hour ago, every single training.

160
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,200
Well, I don't think I think we're still working on it as we speak.

161
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,520
But as of one hour ago, I would say 90 percent.

162
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,600
And by the time this is over, by the time the day is done,

163
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,040
every single live training that I have ever done

164
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,400
personally has been deleted from the group.

165
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,960
OK, I've gone live over 150 times.

166
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,760
I've interviewed over 100 people.

167
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,840
Everything that I've ever done in this group personally

168
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,120
has been wiped. OK, it's gone.

169
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,400
It's done. And it is no more.

170
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,600
It's it's it's just gone. OK.

171
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:15,480
And there are over the next, you know, there might be a few interviews

172
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,520
still that we're trying to pull down, whatever.

173
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,160
But over the next few days, you're going to see everything disappear.

174
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,040
The gravy train is over.

175
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,480
And I want to work with the serious people only.

176
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,080
OK, so with that said, guys, what I'm going to do,

177
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:32,600
I'm going to spend three minutes, five minutes tops.

178
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:37,040
And I'm going to show you what right what the art of digital

179
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,120
real estate 2.0 looks like really quick.

180
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,880
I'm going to share my screen and how you can be a part of it.

181
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,040
And then we're going to get into the training, going to get into the giveaways

182
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,960
and leave you guys with a ton of value, give you guys the copies,

183
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,960
the replays for those of you that stay till the end.

184
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,280
And we're going to go from there.

185
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,320
So let me just do this really quick, Porter.

186
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,960
I'm still good on the the volume.

187
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,840
Yep, I can hear you perfect.

188
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,640
All right, guys, I want to present to you.

189
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,520
This is something I'm super stoked about this, guys.

190
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,000
I want to present to you version 2.0.

191
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,800
Let me just make sure I got this right. Hold on.

192
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,760
I don't want to be sharing anything just yet.

193
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,280
Let's make sure everything's good. OK.

194
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,240
Yes. OK, let me go ahead and get rid of this.

195
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,560
Guys, so with that said, I want to introduce you guys

196
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,240
to the rank and rent academy.

197
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,520
OK, that is where we are transitioning.

198
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,120
I'm going to show that to you right now as I share my screen.

199
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,720
OK, Porter, can you see my screen?

200
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,920
Yeah, I can see it perfectly.

201
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,040
Guys, welcome to the rank and rent academy.

202
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,360
This is a this is where our Facebook group has now gone.

203
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,200
And it is where it is going to be.

204
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,280
I'm going to give you guys a link here in just a moment

205
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,560
if you guys want to check it out.

206
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,480
But I want to just walk you through it really briefly.

207
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,720
Again, three minutes tops.

208
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,560
What we have some introductory videos

209
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,760
and stuff that explain how all this stuff is laid out.

210
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,800
But I want to walk you through the content really quick.

211
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,560
We have over I think it's 15 to 17 mini courses.

212
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,000
They call these mini courses.

213
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,400
You can also view them as modules.

214
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,880
But within each mini course, you're going to see lessons.

215
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,280
By the way, really quick, if you're in digital landlords

216
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,560
and you're freaking out going, oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh,

217
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,840
this is not for you, you guys will have access to this.

218
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,600
Do not worry.

219
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,840
We're going to get you guys access to this

220
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,960
because you're part of digital landlords.

221
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,440
So don't be freaking out. You don't need to go whatever.

222
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,240
You're going to have access to this. OK.

223
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,480
But I do want to just show you this.

224
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,280
This is the classroom section.

225
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,080
This we're going to be adding to this every single month,

226
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,560
if not every single week.

227
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,320
I want to show you two of my favorite sections.

228
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,480
But obviously, guys, we talk about mapping your goals,

229
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:37,480
the mindset, tools, niches, due diligence, SEO, sales, all that kind of stuff.

230
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,080
This is these are two of my favorite mini courses.

231
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,680
Really quick. Number one is the vault.

232
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:50,000
OK, the vault, guys, is where I am going to be putting all of the library,

233
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,560
all hundred and fifty plus lives that we've done over the past

234
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,440
three and a half years are going to be found in the vault.

235
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,840
Right now, we have six different lives.

236
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,360
And every single week with that, to not overwhelm you guys,

237
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,960
every week, we're going to be adding one to two new lives that we did

238
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,080
back in twenty, twenty one, twenty, twenty two, twenty, twenty three.

239
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,040
We're just going to be stacking this vault with every bit of content.

240
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,480
OK, that module is going to be packed.

241
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:20,480
That, I guess, mini course is going to be packed with all kinds of training,

242
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:25,880
all kinds of stuff from ads to, you know, how much should this.

243
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,720
I mean, every nuanced topic you could possibly think about.

244
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,080
OK, that's that one.

245
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,800
The other one I want to show you guys is this, the interview series.

246
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,680
This is where I have interviewed over a hundred.

247
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,200
I think it's maybe even over 200 people, people just like you,

248
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,280
people from all walks of life, moms, dads, single moms, single dads,

249
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,960
people with speech impediments, people with accents, people with

250
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,680
no sales experience, people with no technical experience,

251
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,000
people that are retired, people that are young,

252
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,440
all kinds of different walks of life where I've interviewed them

253
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:58,520
and I've gleaned and I've tried to pull out what has helped them to be successful.

254
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,640
And we're going to have all those interviews inside of here.

255
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,040
Again, we're going to be adding, I think we have six in there right now.

256
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,840
And we're just slowly adding every single week.

257
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,080
We're going to be adding new interviews.

258
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,360
I don't want to just I didn't just want to throw everything in there

259
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,000
and just the vomit on you guys.

260
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,920
I want you guys to catch up on all the content.

261
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,520
And then every week you have like a little goody to watch a little

262
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,680
45 minute to an hour

263
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,320
vault video as well as the interview series.

264
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:25,160
OK, because also we have the replays, a bunch of different stuff.

265
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,600
Another thing I want to show you guys that's really, really cool

266
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,440
is we have this community world map where you're going to be able to see

267
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,640
where every single person that's in this community is, where

268
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,920
let's say you guys go on a little vacation to Vegas for your buddy's

269
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,280
bachelor party, you're like, hey, while I'm in Vegas, I want to spend,

270
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,440
you know, an hour on Tuesday and try to link up with somebody else

271
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,600
that's in the space, go grab lunch, go grab coffee.

272
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,880
You can jump on the community world map, go in, find them as a member,

273
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,960
send them a message and link up.

274
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,840
Guys, the community, this is this is what I've realized.

275
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,680
I've bought twenty three thousand dollars plus in courses

276
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,800
just related to rank and rent.

277
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:06,080
I always watch the the the course, you know, once maybe a year.

278
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,520
But I'm in the community every single day.

279
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,800
I've literally made I have two partners right now

280
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,200
that I've made from my community.

281
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,880
I have I've made I've had deals come out of it.

282
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,040
I've had friendships come out of it.

283
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,880
I've had all kinds of stuff that have come out of it.

284
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,480
So the community, guys, is is where I think the value of these.

285
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,000
And ironically, school calls these communities, but it's a group.

286
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,840
That is where I think the value is.

287
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,840
OK, so obviously, you can have the community aspect.

288
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,080
You're going to have the classroom.

289
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,240
You're going to have the community world map.

290
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,720
And then every single week, you can notice on the calendar.

291
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,320
I am going to be going live every single week.

292
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,240
Porter, can you see this on my screen?

293
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,240
Yep, I guess every single Monday to start the week, seven a.m.

294
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,800
I put it as a Q&A, but sometimes it's going to be training,

295
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,640
sometimes going to be Q&A every single Monday.

296
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,880
Me, I'm going to be live.

297
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,920
I'm going to be talking to you guys.

298
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,080
Any questions that you have, we're going to be going on to a live.

299
00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:00,040
And the other thing, too, is all those lives are going to be put into

300
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,200
the replay section in case you can't catch it.

301
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,840
OK, so guys, there's a ton of other stuff.

302
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,880
I don't want to bore you with all the details,

303
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,120
but this is the Rankin Red Academy.

304
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,720
I've been working on this for months.

305
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,800
We're like, where do we transition?

306
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,400
What do we do? What do we do?

307
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,320
And this is it, by the way, all of the material in here.

308
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,080
Let me give you a little sample.

309
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:26,720
Let's go to let's go to the map your goal section, for example.

310
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,920
All of these videos that are in here, OK,

311
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,960
every single one of these videos, this is not training

312
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,680
that I pulled from somewhere else.

313
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,680
These are all new videos.

314
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,600
OK, this is all new content that I have produced for this community.

315
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,080
So all of this is new stuff.

316
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:49,160
OK, so that said, guys, that is where this is going.

317
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:52,960
The art of digital real estate, RIP, it was real.

318
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,320
Now we are moving into the

319
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,160
Rankin Red Academy.

320
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,680
And if you guys want to check that out, I'm going to go ahead

321
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:04,280
and just drop a little linky poo, by the way, just so you guys know

322
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,840
our plan with this.

323
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,440
I didn't even mention this, by the way, this is paid, by the way.

324
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,640
Our goal is we're going to be charging 100 bucks a month.

325
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,040
This is a this is it's a community.

326
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,480
So you pay every month.

327
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,320
But the introductory rate, what we're doing for this launch

328
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,400
is we're doing at half price.

329
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,400
We're doing at $50 per month. OK.

330
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,600
Now, one of the thing you need to know, that's why you digital

331
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,520
landlord students, don't worry, you're going to get access

332
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,760
any money that you spend. OK.

333
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:33,480
Any money you spend on the Rankin Red Academy,

334
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,760
we're going to take 20 percent of that money

335
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:39,160
and we're going to credit that toward you,

336
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,840
towards your digital landlords membership

337
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,360
when you decide to jump into digital landlords. OK.

338
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,320
So if you're in for a year, we'll take 20 percent of that.

339
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:51,080
That will be a discounted rate off of your digital landlord membership.

340
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:56,120
So you're you being in this is you're in a way kind of paying towards that,

341
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,840
which you'll eventually join, we hope, at some point. OK.

342
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,760
So that's it, Isaac Cheatham.

343
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,800
What's the main difference between this?

344
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,960
Isaac Cheatham, you have access to this, so don't worry about it.

345
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:09,120
This is this is the this is the beginner.

346
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,400
This is the free group.

347
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,680
This is basically the free group.

348
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,760
We're going to have the community.

349
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,920
We're going to have the training.

350
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,000
But we're not touching on anything that's in digital landlords.

351
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,800
So the difference is everything.

352
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,200
So in case anyone's like, well, I'll just get into this.

353
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,360
No, this is very different than digital landlords.

354
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,040
But this is basically the free group on steroids.

355
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,360
We're going to give it attention.

356
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,480
We're going to be having, you know, Porter and Jason are going to be in there

357
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,640
giving the the free coaching calls.

358
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,240
If you guys want to jump on those,

359
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,880
we're going to be doing giveaways, new trainings all the time.

360
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:42,000
But Isaac, this is nothing, nothing the same as digital landlords.

361
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,080
OK, this is like this is where you start.

362
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,800
This is the free group. Move to this. OK.

363
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,040
But you get access anyway, so it doesn't matter.

364
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,240
So here we go.

365
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,360
Rankinretire.com.

366
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,080
Easy peasy. Porter, you want to try that link?

367
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,200
Rankinretire.com.

368
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,440
And then, guys, we're going to get into the actual training.

369
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,760
We're done.

370
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,240
Hold on one second.

371
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,400
Make sure that work that post.

372
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,040
Yep, got it. Beautiful.

373
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,480
Let's make sure it goes to the old community.

374
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,160
And there it goes.

375
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,320
OK, let me just see if I can pin this.

376
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:22,040
Chris Aren't said people appreciate what they pay for.

377
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:22,960
Yes, 100 percent.

378
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,840
By the way, Chris, Isaac, those of you that are in digital landlords,

379
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,840
do not be afraid, my friends.

380
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,960
You guys have access to this.

381
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,640
I'm going to be working with the team to figure out how we give you access

382
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,520
so you don't have to pay.

383
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,280
So none of you digital landlords go and try to pay, please.

384
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,280
For everybody else, if you want to be inside the community,

385
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,360
it is $50 per month right now.

386
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,520
Again, 20 percent of that is going to be credited

387
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:45,320
towards your digital landlords membership when you make the jump. OK.

388
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,040
All right. And by the way, funny enough, Isaac asked what the difference is.

389
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,560
I literally have a note right here.

390
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,360
This is not digital landlords, guys.

391
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,480
We're not teaching the same stuff at digital landlords.

392
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,640
Don't expect to go in and learn, you know, exactly what digital

393
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,520
landlords students are learning.

394
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,880
This is an intro to the rank and run.

395
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,440
This is a community, this access to myself, my team, et cetera.

396
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:08,720
But I will tell you guys, there is going to be a ton of value in that vault.

397
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,560
OK, a ton of value in that vault.

398
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,120
You guys are going to be able to pull from that.

399
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,440
Just that one mini course.

400
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,560
So just so you guys know, that's that.

401
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,720
Welcome to the rank and run academy.

402
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:23,960
And guys, one more thing I want to mention, anybody that jumps in today,

403
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:28,240
I went into my vault, which is like all my old videos

404
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:32,200
of all my, you know, my old sales calls that I flopped, my new sales,

405
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,800
you know, all that kind of stuff from way back in the day.

406
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:39,120
And I found this closed sales call back in 2018

407
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:44,800
that anybody that joins today, I'm going to I'm going to share this with you guys.

408
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,960
I'm going to let you guys have this.

409
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:49,600
It's like a 33 minute video of a closed sales call I did back in 2018.

410
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,840
That's going to be included for anybody that joins today as well.

411
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,160
OK, so anybody that stays at all is going to get the replay of this.

412
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,480
We're also going to be doing the giveaways.

413
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,960
We're going to be doing the training now.

414
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,840
And then anybody that joins, we're going to be giving away the

415
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:06,880
you're going to also get the sales, the sales recording that did back in 2018.

416
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,800
OK, rank and retired dot com.

417
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,640
Check it out. That is the rank and run academy.

418
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,480
And guys, with that said, let's get into the training.

419
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,680
Porter, what are you at right now per month?

420
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,400
I'm almost 11K, actually, right now.

421
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,520
Ten, one, ten, ten, one, ten, ten, ten, seven right now.

422
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,600
Amazing. OK, by the way,

423
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,040
we got to get you to 20 quick, just so you know.

424
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,920
Welcome, Dylan, first join.

425
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,320
So, Dylan, welcome to the community.

426
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,560
Welcome to Rankin Academy for being the first join.

427
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,080
I think, Ashley, we need to hook him up with something special.

428
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:47,200
So, Ashley, why don't you send him some swag?

429
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,880
Let's send him some swag out of the deal store

430
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,400
since he was the first one to make the leap.

431
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,960
Welcome, Dylan.

432
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,840
So let's get into the training, guys.

433
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,400
I want to I want to give you guys some real value as I go out here.

434
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:00,240
Last live, it's one twenty five in the morning.

435
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,320
It's been a long three days.

436
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,960
I've been working my tail off.

437
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,440
I'm in the middle of West Africa.

438
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,120
I should be going and enjoying nature and checking all this kind of stuff out.

439
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,760
I've just been working because I wanted to get this thing launched

440
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,080
as soon as possible.

441
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,840
So let's get into this this training and then we'll do the giveaways. OK.

442
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,120
So, guys, here's what I did this training.

443
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,360
We're going to be talking about how to go from zero to 20K per month

444
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,000
in 2025 with digital real estate.

445
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,440
And that's if I had to start over today.

446
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:30,680
So if you told me, hey, Nick, you know, you're at zero.

447
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,600
Like you're literally at no money.

448
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,160
I'm going to take everything away.

449
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,040
I'm going to take away all your clients.

450
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,080
You can't call your old clients.

451
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,360
What would you do?

452
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,640
And I sat there when I was preparing this, which I've spent a lot of time

453
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,920
just preparing this this part right here.

454
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,720
And I thought, what would I really do if I was sitting,

455
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,400
let's say, with Porter and he asked me this question?

456
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,920
What would actually what I do?

457
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,840
Not what what sounds good. What would I do?

458
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,600
So before I get into it, I've got like a few things.

459
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,920
I just want to I'm going to buzz through them.

460
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,200
And then any questions you guys have, we're going to we're going to go into that, too.

461
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,120
Porter, if you were to do that today, let's say you were going from zero to 10K.

462
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,160
Everything taken away.

463
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,080
You know, obviously, your skill set, your knowledge is there,

464
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,600
but all your clients are taken away.

465
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,520
What's the very first thing you would do? Just curious.

466
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,560
I would set my goals.

467
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,600
I would map out how many.

468
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,240
Well, I pick one niche, first of all, or two niches,

469
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,240
because I think simplicity is best.

470
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,640
I would I would set my goal and figure out

471
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,960
how many campaigns I needed to run every single month

472
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,600
and how many closing calls I would need to do every single month

473
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,240
to make sure it happens with a little bit of a buffer.

474
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,520
And then I would just simplify it.

475
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,560
I would just completely simplify the whole process.

476
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,800
Just pick one or two niches just to scale it and not try to overcomplicate it.

477
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,160
I love it, dude. I love it. Keep it simple.

478
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,000
Real quick, I got my comments over here on the phone.

479
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,840
Not to jump, but actually keep track of this.

480
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,840
Isaac Cheatham, he needs a coffee cup.

481
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,640
He needs a coffee cup.

482
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,240
He's one of the swag winners. Done.

483
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,640
Give him a coffee mug, man.

484
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,040
Give Isaac Cheatham a coffee mug.

485
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,000
Thanks for asking, brother.

486
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,760
And now everyone's going to ask for a coffee mug.

487
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,720
But Isaac, first winner of the swag.

488
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,720
OK, I like that, dude.

489
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,320
I like that. Sounds sounds simple.

490
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,520
And guys, I don't ever think you want to overcomplicate this.

491
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:17,240
So I'm going to go through what I would do,

492
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,440
and then I'm going to kind of set it back on Porter as well.

493
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,320
By the way, if you guys don't know, Porter isn't just on here because he's my brother.

494
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,720
He's on here because he's at 10.

495
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,560
You said 10, what, 10, 7?

496
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,920
Yeah, 10, 700 now.

497
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,200
Ten thousand seven hundred dollars a month.

498
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,440
He's also working on the farm.

499
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:33,040
When I talked to him today, we're doing WhatsApp.

500
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:36,400
He was actually doing farm stuff in the middle of making calls.

501
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,760
Like, even though he does that part time, he does it full time in the summer.

502
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,520
And then I feel like part time.

503
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,440
I feel like this year you've worked more than you did.

504
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,720
Even last year.

505
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,720
Oh, yeah, by far.

506
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,680
And I've done way better. It's crazy.

507
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,840
Yeah, I feel like you just do better when you're it's honest.

508
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,040
It's the truth.

509
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,240
So here's what I would do, guys.

510
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:57,360
Step number one, if I was starting from zero, zero to 20K.

511
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:02,000
Step number one is and this may sound like I'm going from the very beginning

512
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,320
or I'm going a bit back, but this is literally I would do this before anything.

513
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:11,520
Number one is I would figure out why I wanted the 20K. OK.

514
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,360
Why? Why? Like, why do I actually want to make 20K?

515
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,400
And I know it sounds silly, whatever.

516
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,440
But for me, when everything everything changed for me in 2020.

517
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:28,720
Because in 2019, I sat down with a pen and a paper and I asked myself,

518
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,080
what do you want? Number one, which I said, 100K a month.

519
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,760
And then I asked the most important question, which was why?

520
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,360
And I answered, why do I want that?

521
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,960
And then that answer, I asked why again, and I went like seven layers deep.

522
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:45,640
And guys, I can tell you when I figured out exactly why I wanted that money,

523
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,520
I realized that it wasn't even the reason that I originally thought.

524
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:55,160
But every time that, you know, things got tough or I got tired or whatever

525
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,240
it was, it was Wednesday.

526
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,320
I just it was easy to remember my wife.

527
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,360
And I was very clear about it.

528
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:06,200
So if I was starting today, before I did anything, before I chose my niche,

529
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,480
before I chose my city, before I map my goals, first thing I'm doing

530
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,640
is I'm sitting down going, why do I want 20K?

531
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,040
What what what do I need? 20K?

532
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,960
Why is it not 25? Why is it not 30?

533
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,240
Why is it not 15? What's the 20K for?

534
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,600
Why is it important to me?

535
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,040
And that's the first thing I do.

536
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,480
OK, step number two, guys.

537
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,320
Again, and this is coming from somebody who went from

538
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:32,280
barely making like barely scraping by eight to 10K a month back in 2019.

539
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:37,840
To in July of 2020, doing a hundred thousand dollars per month.

540
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,880
And some of these are the same steps.

541
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,760
And some of this I didn't do, which I wish I would have.

542
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,440
OK, step number two for me would be eliminate everything from my life

543
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,800
that doesn't get me closer to that goal.

544
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,520
And the goal being 20K.

545
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:54,200
I heard her Mosey her Mosey say this, I watched it.

546
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,960
I don't I haven't watched a ton of his stuff in the last year,

547
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:00,880
but I did watch something recently and he said he said this and it stuck with me.

548
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,400
And I've shared it in digital landlords as well.

549
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,840
It says, ask yourself the following question every single time this year.

550
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,360
Does this and guys, write this down.

551
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,040
This isn't from me.

552
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:14,960
This is from somebody that's way smarter, way richer, way more business savvy.

553
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,160
And I love this question.

554
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:20,840
Does this thing, person or belief

555
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,920
make it less or more likely that I hit my goal?

556
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,960
Anything you do, anything you do,

557
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,600
getting ready to go out with the boys and hit some drinks.

558
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:37,080
Does this thing, person, belief make it more or less likely that I hit my goals?

559
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
OK. Getting ready to go on a vacation midweek.

560
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:45,880
Same question. Getting ready, you know, whatever it is.

561
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,320
Ask yourself that lunch that you got invited to.

562
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,480
Is it getting your close?

563
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,080
Is it getting you closer to your goal?

564
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,160
Is the belief getting you closer to your goal?

565
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:57,560
Is the is the person that you're around getting you closer to your goal?

566
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,320
If not, cut it.

567
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,360
OK, if you assuming that you want to hit the goal,

568
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,720
that would be the plan here, right, is I want to hit the 20K.

569
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,720
OK, step number three for me, guys, is then I would sit down

570
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,200
and I would set the date and create an exact roadmap for how to get there.

571
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,480
Now, I will say this inside of the RankinRant Academy

572
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,600
in the map your goals section.

573
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:24,200
That's exactly what I walk through of how to set that exact date, target

574
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,840
and how to how to create that map of how to get there.

575
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,120
And I'm not just talking about like a loose map.

576
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:34,720
I'm talking, OK, I want to break it down by quarter, month, week, day, everything.

577
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,080
How many deals am I going to need to close?

578
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:40,640
How many people am I going to need to pitch to get that many pitches? Right.

579
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,040
Sorry, how many people am I going to need to pitch to close that many deals?

580
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,560
How many business owners am I going to need to put on trial to get that many pitches

581
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:53,840
all the way down to how many due diligence am I going to need to actually do? OK.

582
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,120
That would be steps.

583
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,680
I think that was step three, right? Step three.

584
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:02,200
Step four, by the way, for those of you that are trying to scribble,

585
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,640
just stay to the end. I'll extend you to replay.

586
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,440
OK, step number four is I would pick.

587
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,560
I know I've told you guys in the past, pick one.

588
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:13,360
I would pick three boring, tried and true niches

589
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,480
that I was going to focus on exclusively.

590
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,400
I would just out the gate, pick three.

591
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:22,680
You know, and if I was going to start today without saying anything else,

592
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:25,240
Porter, if you're going to start today, what are the three niches you'd pick?

593
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,200
I know one of them is fencing.

594
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,000
Fencing, concrete and masonry.

595
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,920
There you go.

596
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,520
So from somebody who is really trying to get it this year,

597
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,760
who's really trying to get to your goals, 25K by the end of the year.

598
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,040
Yeah, and I've gotten two niches and most of them are concrete.

599
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,600
Most are concrete.

600
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,640
He's getting you're in concrete and fencing.

601
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,000
Yeah, homies at ten thousand seven hundred dollars a month.

602
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,720
He's in two niches.

603
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,240
One of them, you guys think, is oversaturated.

604
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,920
It is it is harder than it was.

605
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,000
Fencing is a great one.

606
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Masonry is a great one.

607
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,400
OK, there's a lot of good niches go into three.

608
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,880
So I would go and pick three boring, tried and true niches

609
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,720
that I was going to focus on exclusively. OK.

610
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,160
Step five is I would go and I would set.

611
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,840
Well, you know, this is a step that you don't have to do.

612
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:18,320
But the next step is the due diligence process, where what I would do

613
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:23,160
is I would go in and crank out as many due diligence as I could possibly find

614
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,320
as I could possibly do.

615
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,680
I will tell you guys this just to give a little plug

616
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:31,320
for the rank and rent engine tool is knowing what I know now.

617
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,560
I would immediately go and fricking set up an account with rank

618
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:37,200
and rent engine just for the due diligence,

619
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,480
because you're going to be able to do due diligence in seven minutes

620
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,960
instead of 30. And you can do due diligence.

621
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,040
You can do four in a time.

622
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:47,480
You could do one and you can crank out way more due diligence.

623
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:50,640
So for me, knowing what I know now, I'd go set up an account.

624
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,600
I'd get the discount code.

625
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,920
It's like 69. What is it?

626
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:56,440
69 bucks for the starter pack for the first two, three months.

627
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:00,520
If you get the discount code and you can crank out due diligence like that.

628
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,800
And what I would do, guys, is I would go

629
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:08,720
and I would find my first five niche and city combinations.

630
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,520
OK, I'd find my first five.

631
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,440
Now, I know I'm deviating a little bit from what I've maybe said in the past.

632
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,960
And by the way, those of you that are that are in digital landlords.

633
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:23,400
I am in the middle of finishing the training 3.0.

634
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:27,200
This is the third time I'm going to be creating the new version of digital landlords.

635
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,040
But I'm in the middle of that.

636
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,360
So there's going to be some minor changes.

637
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:34,360
But I would go and I would find my first five niche and city combinations.

638
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,560
One of the reasons you can do that is because you have tools

639
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:40,640
like rank and rent engine where you can just bust out due diligence.

640
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,840
OK, now this is one thing I want to I did not do this.

641
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,800
And I really strongly encourage you guys to do this.

642
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:52,520
Is if I was starting again today, from this point on, I would record everything.

643
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:58,720
OK, loom Vimeo recording tool.

644
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,640
And I think it's on Google Chrome Store.

645
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,240
Porter, what do you use to record stuff?

646
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,240
A snapshot snapshot.

647
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:11,400
So it doesn't matter whatever you want to use, record everything.

648
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:16,000
Why? Because I'm going to hand this off to my VA as soon as possible.

649
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,520
And I can tell you guys in advance, due diligence is one of those things

650
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:23,560
you are going to want to hand off as soon as possible.

651
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:27,360
Once you master it, once you get good at it, you're going to want to get somebody else

652
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,480
to be putting in those hours.

653
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,160
OK, so, guys, yes, go find those five niches.

654
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,720
You can do it by hand. By the way, you don't have to use a tool.

655
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,880
Use frickin paper. I don't care.

656
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:41,400
But record exactly how you're doing the due diligence so that you have a PDF.

657
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:45,760
I'd have a PDF and I have videos on each one of those steps.

658
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,320
Because then I can hand it off to a VA.

659
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,080
OK, guys, I'm trying to get to 20K.

660
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,120
I'm not trying to get a deal.

661
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,240
I'm not trying to get one deal. I'm trying to get to 20K.

662
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,600
And I think you guys should.

663
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:58,640
And the reason I chose 20K for this presentation is because at 20K,

664
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,520
most everyone's out of the rat race, right?

665
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,400
I see people on here. I recognize they have all kinds of jobs

666
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:08,920
for everything from, you know, whatever.

667
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,120
Some people are business owners.

668
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,000
Some people work. They're teachers.

669
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,960
Some people are doctors, whatever it is, guys.

670
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,880
But. At the end of the day,

671
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,600
just just trust me on this one, guys, just record everything.

672
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,440
OK, just record everything.

673
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,960
And at 20K, you can almost anyone can get out of the rat race.

674
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,080
OK, that's that's really what I'm trying to say.

675
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,960
OK, so once I did that, guys, I found my first five

676
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,280
niche city combinations and I recorded everything.

677
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:41,080
Then what I would do is I would go and set up not one, not two.

678
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:44,520
I'd go set up three Google ad campaigns.

679
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,480
For three of those five cities, I've chosen five

680
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,960
niche and city combinations.

681
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,200
I'd pick three of them and I'd go set up three campaigns.

682
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,400
And then I would out of those three, I would choose the best two

683
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,920
and I would turn to one.

684
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,680
OK, I turn to one.

685
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,400
And then what I would do is as soon as one started to hit,

686
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,560
I would pause the other.

687
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,920
So now I got one going.

688
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:11,680
I got two ready to rip ones, pause ones hasn't been started yet.

689
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,560
And I got my first three pop, pop, pop.

690
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:17,520
OK, done. Just like that.

691
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:22,640
OK, now, again, guys, which this is one of those things

692
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,120
where I'm telling you what I would do now.

693
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:30,520
The reason I do it like this is because I know that once I get that first deal,

694
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,840
what everyone does is, Porter, this happened to you.

695
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,560
You got your first deal and then you're like, oh, back to the drawing board.

696
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,600
Now I got to go do due diligence.

697
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,000
And it kind of like slowed you down.

698
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,440
Yeah, I didn't have a plan.

699
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,520
I landed a deal and then I had to go back.

700
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,280
And it took me weeks and weeks and weeks.

701
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:49,520
And this was I should have been more prepared. Amazing.

702
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:53,960
So guys, again, record this record how you're setting up ads.

703
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,640
OK, you might not want to hand off ads right at the back.

704
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,120
Like, I don't want to trust a VA.

705
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,840
Just record it because you're going to at some point not going to say

706
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,040
because I don't I haven't set up ads personally in years.

707
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,040
And I'm the one that pays for them.

708
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,480
OK, I have somebody I trust.

709
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,600
Francesca sets them up.

710
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,680
And guess what? I don't even think she sets them up anymore.

711
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,720
I think she oversees somebody else to set them up.

712
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,560
So you're going to have to let the stuff out of control, guys.

713
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,040
I didn't record this stuff for years.

714
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,480
I was doing I was the only one then finally like, oh,

715
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,320
there's this book called The E Myth.

716
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,720
It says I should should create a system.

717
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,360
And then I started I'm just a knucklehead.

718
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,760
I'm trying to give you guys the shortcut here.

719
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:31,720
OK, so, guys, once I did that, I got the campaign running campaigns running.

720
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:36,640
I I would then go and build out my list for that city.

721
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,080
OK, now, if you've never done this before,

722
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,880
I would probably recommend that you build the list first

723
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,200
before you even decide to set up the ad.

724
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,280
So, you know, there's business owners.

725
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,520
But for me, because I've done this so many times,

726
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,960
I know what I'm looking for.

727
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,920
I can I can eyeball it and know, you know, hey, this

728
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,640
this has got enough business owners.

729
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,800
And for me, to be honest with you, if I see that there's three business

730
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,840
owners that are paying for ads for me, that's enough.

731
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:05,560
OK, because I'm really, really confident I'm going to close the deal.

732
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,360
And I know how to show them all the other work I've done, et cetera.

733
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,360
Now, in this scenario, I wouldn't be able to show them that.

734
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,920
But again, guys, I would then go build my list.

735
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:16,000
If you've never done this before, I'd probably do the list before. OK.

736
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:20,400
So, guys, now this is where I'm going to change a little bit

737
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,560
from what I've said in the past.

738
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,640
After I built the list, we got the campaign running.

739
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,560
We got to pause campaigns.

740
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,080
We got one one running.

741
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:30,560
And then the next that we're building, we build the list. Right.

742
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,960
So then, guys, this is where I deviate just a little bit.

743
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:37,240
What I would do while we're waiting for the ads for the ads to work,

744
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:42,720
the leads to come in, is I would go and of those two remaining campaigns. OK.

745
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:47,080
Whatever one is the lowest hanging fruit

746
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:51,240
with the lowest hanging fruit, like with the city niche combination,

747
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:56,440
I would actually recommend if I was getting to going to going to go to 20K,

748
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:01,920
I would actually recommend going and just building your first website.

749
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,560
So while you're waiting, you got, again, just to recap,

750
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,880
you got one that's running ads.

751
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,160
You're waiting for leads to come in.

752
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,120
Of course, leads come in. Focus on that.

753
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:13,120
You got that. You got to pause ready to rip as soon as you're good.

754
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,000
Then these remaining two, I'd choose one of the two.

755
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,480
I'd actually go build a website.

756
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:20,480
I've never said that in the past, but I'm starting to realize

757
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:25,000
that I think a good agency, you've got your you've got your ads.

758
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,960
Those are your quick deals that you're going to go snipe.

759
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:31,720
And then whenever you come across those city and niche combinations

760
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,960
that are very low hanging fruit, go and build the website.

761
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,160
Because guess what?

762
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,760
Once you close that first deal, you can always run ads to that website.

763
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,720
Now, you got to be careful.

764
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:44,040
You want to make sure that you're you know what the due diligence looks like.

765
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,560
I would make sure that the one that you build is the one

766
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,760
that's the lowest hanging fruit, because once you build it,

767
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,480
you're kind of stuck with it.

768
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:55,000
But if you're confident in it, go and build this. Why?

769
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,360
Because now I've got ads running.

770
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,880
I've got to pause.

771
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,200
And I've also got one that's now starting to rank.

772
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:05,480
And I can be doing work on this while I'm waiting for the leads coming.

773
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,400
I know a lot of people.

774
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,240
They get in.

775
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:12,880
They set up a campaign and they're like, what do I do now?

776
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,240
What do I do now?

777
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,160
And it's like, well, you go do more due diligence.

778
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,840
Well, I already told you to do five.

779
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,920
Right. So this is a good use of time.

780
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,120
And now, guys, you're going to go build out the website.

781
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,600
And guess what? While you're building out the site,

782
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,520
you know what you're going to do?

783
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:27,440
You're going to go and you're going to freaking record it.

784
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,160
Right. So you can hand it off to a VA.

785
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,200
Follow me so far.

786
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:35,680
I got four more things and I'm done. OK, guys, after that,

787
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,200
what I would do is once, of course, I'm sitting here.

788
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,320
The main target is to wait for the leads to come in.

789
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,960
Once the leads start to come in for that first city,

790
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,760
I'd go and I'd close a deal using my process.

791
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,400
If you guys don't know my process by now,

792
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,160
it's because you're brand new to the group.

793
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,000
Go into the Rankin Red Academy.

794
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,680
We outline the entire process in the Money, Love, Speed module.

795
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:58,320
I would use the my process to close my first deal,

796
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,720
even if it took me three tries.

797
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:05,440
OK, meaning even if I got leads coming in, I hooked a business owner.

798
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,000
I sent three to five leads.

799
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,920
I got them on the phone. I flubbed the deal. I lost it.

800
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,400
I had to do it again and again, even if it took me three,

801
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,800
even if it took me four or five tries.

802
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,560
We have a guy today inside of our community,

803
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,040
inside of Digital Landlords.

804
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,440
And that kind of a similar thing happened to him.

805
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,760
I think he went through a couple of business owners,

806
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,360
but he had spent a couple of hundred bucks on ads.

807
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,000
But he kept going. He kept going. He got the deal.

808
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,960
Guys, you don't lose money

809
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,360
until you quit running the ads, until you just decide to give up.

810
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,400
OK, so I would again.

811
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,560
That's the main thing.

812
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,800
What's different about what I'm giving you with this approach, guys,

813
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:43,280
is I already know what's going to happen is if you get that first deal,

814
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,680
you're focusing on one campaign.

815
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:49,840
Then as soon as you get that deal, you're going to go back to the due diligence.

816
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,360
And it's just like it's it's just this thing.

817
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,560
We're trying to get to 20K as soon as possible.

818
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:58,480
OK, so I would go, I would close that deal.

819
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,320
I would record every step of the process.

820
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,320
Guys, I'm building out a library for my company handbook.

821
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:06,240
OK, and then, guys, as soon as I land that first deal,

822
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:12,680
I just recoup my costs and I would immediately go to onlinejobs.ph.

823
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:17,160
Shout out plug for John Jonas and his his amazing product.

824
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,880
I would go to onlinejobs.ph

825
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:24,080
and I'm spending the first money that comes in to get a VA.

826
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,480
No questions asked.

827
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,280
All that stuff, due diligence,

828
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:33,960
fricking building websites, all that crap that I don't want to do.

829
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:37,560
I'm I've now got a library of stuff that I've trained them.

830
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,680
That I've I've got these videos on.

831
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,480
I'm just handing this stuff off, man.

832
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,040
I'm not dealing with it. I don't want to deal with it.

833
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,040
I'm trying to get to 20K.

834
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,920
I'm not. Again, the difference between what I'm talking about now,

835
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:50,080
some of you guys have heard me talk about getting that first deal going,

836
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:54,720
having a goal of getting to 20K is you're going to structure it differently

837
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,520
than if you have a goal of one K of one deal. Right.

838
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,800
And a lot of people don't think about this,

839
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,880
but this is how I'd get to 20K as soon as possible. OK.

840
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,240
So I'm going to get that VA that first one.

841
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,000
No questions asked.

842
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,480
Don't take the money and start, you know, go go buy clothes.

843
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,560
Put it into a VA recoup your costs on the ads, put it into a VA

844
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,080
and let them go buy back your time.

845
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:20,200
OK, now what I do is I turn my VA loose on my library

846
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:25,480
and then I train that person and have them start cranking due diligence

847
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:29,840
and to also to go build that first website that I that I sold. Right.

848
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,680
So they're going to just be churning out due diligence.

849
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,200
Everything, not everything.

850
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,680
This is when everything changed. But guys,

851
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,680
do before ranking an engine,

852
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,680
how long did it take you to do a due diligence?

853
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:47,080
It took me like 30 to 45 minutes because I had to go back and forth

854
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,880
and back and forth. It took forever.

855
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,600
I can open up like 15, like 10 to 15 minutes.

856
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,160
Like and I've done it like a couple of times.

857
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,840
Like I could do a lot faster if I did it more. Yeah.

858
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,400
For me, 30 minutes is about what it was.

859
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,040
So imagine I've done over personally over a thousand.

860
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,080
Well, I don't know how much how much time have I spent. Right.

861
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:08,000
Imagine you can go and get a VA using your rank and rent

862
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,760
engine account and they can bust one out.

863
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,800
Let's say they're not as fast as you.

864
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,800
Let's say there are 12 minutes of rip. Right.

865
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,920
They're they could do almost three.

866
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:17,880
Let's see. 12. So what they're doing five.

867
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,640
They could do five an hour.

868
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,320
You say four hours a day.

869
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:24,080
So five times four, you can do 20 a day.

870
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:28,280
You could do. I mean, dude, you can crank out some due diligence.

871
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:30,280
You can have them attack some cities. Right.

872
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,920
And so now all of a sudden they're doing due diligence.

873
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,360
They've got a list of these cities.

874
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,200
You're going in, you're making sure that they're good.

875
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,280
And guys, as you close the deal, guess what?

876
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,600
You're turning on the other campaign. Right.

877
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,200
And then that other website, you're setting up the ads.

878
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,960
And now you've got a whole list to do.

879
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,120
And it's just this rinse and repeat cycle.

880
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:49,560
And the issue is, is everyone's thinking about that.

881
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,240
And guys, the first deal is super important.

882
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,200
That's the best deal ever.

883
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:55,080
It's it feels it's the most amazing deal ever. Right.

884
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:59,000
But if we're trying to get to 20K, we've got to we've got to be

885
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,320
going to plan it on 20K.

886
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,840
And that's why I started off by saying set the target,

887
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,000
create the road map and then attack. OK.

888
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,720
And guys, that is exactly the process

889
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,000
that I'm going to be doing until I hit 10K.

890
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,840
I'm going to rinse and repeat, rinse and repeat, rinse and repeat.

891
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:18,760
And then when I hit 10K, then I think around 10K

892
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:21,520
I'm as when I would probably go get my second VA.

893
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,520
You could probably justify it earlier,

894
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:27,280
but you could get to 10K with a VA and yourself

895
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,440
and a simple tool like Rank and Rent Engine.

896
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,040
That's all you need. OK.

897
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,040
You get to 10K.

898
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,720
And then, guys, what my last step would be, as soon as I hit 10K,

899
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,160
I'd get a second VA.

900
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:41,200
I would have every single thing that's not making me more money.

901
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,160
I would have my VA's doing.

902
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,800
I'd be managing two VA's.

903
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,640
I'd be spending my time hooking business owners,

904
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,880
sending over leads and closing deals. That's it.

905
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:54,440
I've had them building websites, writing content, doing due diligence,

906
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:59,200
setting up ads, every single thing except for doing the sales.

907
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:02,120
And I would rinse and repeat until I hit 20K.

908
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:05,680
OK. Now, for those of you like, oh, man,

909
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,040
I wish I would take more notes again.

910
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:10,000
Guys, if you're in 13 minutes, I'm going to be giving away.

911
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,800
Everyone's going to get the replay of this.

912
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,200
You guys go listen to this again.

913
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,800
This is how I would freaking attack it.

914
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,880
By the way, for those of you that did that just hopped on

915
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,160
and have no idea what we're talking about,

916
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:22,920
just a spoiler alert.

917
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,200
The free group's gone.

918
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,200
All the content's gone.

919
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:29,040
Rankandretire.com. Go check it out.

920
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,400
You can rewatch this if you want.

921
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,480
But for those, I know we've got a bunch more people that jumped on.

922
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:35,200
Rankandretire.com. It's pinned at the top.

923
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:36,680
Go check it out.

924
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,040
That is our community.

925
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,080
That is the Rank and Rent Academy. OK.

926
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:44,320
So a couple of notes real quick, notes to some giveaways.

927
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,200
Guys, you plus one to two VA's,

928
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:51,360
you can muscle your way to 20K.

929
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,120
That's insane, right?

930
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:55,400
Porter, how much you pay your VA?

931
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,120
Well, a hundred dollars a week.

932
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:58,240
So four hundred bucks a month.

933
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,640
I think I have one VA that pay five hundred bucks a month.

934
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,920
I think I have my guy here in Africa.

935
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:04,480
It's been with me for like five years.

936
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,760
I pay him three hundred bucks a month.

937
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:09,120
I mean, imagine, right?

938
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:13,720
You plus two people, that's less than a thousand dollars in payroll.

939
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,160
You could scale to 20K a month.

940
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,720
That's freaking insane.

941
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:19,960
What other business, right?

942
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:22,600
OK, when I scale, let me tell you guys this, guys,

943
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:25,280
when I scaled to 100K per month, this is what my team looked like.

944
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,480
It was me.

945
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:30,120
Francesca was overseeing the sites and the clients.

946
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:33,240
There was one guy helping me hook business owners.

947
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:36,000
There was one guy answering and transferring leads.

948
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,720
And then I had one and a half because one of them was part time,

949
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:43,120
one and a half paid by the thousand words content writer.

950
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:46,880
And I had two VA's. OK, so what is that?

951
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,280
Like five people.

952
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:52,520
One, two, three, four, five, six.

953
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:58,000
Six full time, three of which were VA's or overseas.

954
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:02,680
One was part time and we it was a million dollar company.

955
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:06,320
That's insane. Like my payroll was nothing

956
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,720
and it was a million dollar company.

957
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,600
OK, seven figure agency.

958
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,200
Now, last thing I want to cover,

959
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,120
what what kind of time frame would I be looking at for this 20K?

960
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:20,280
I if I were actually doing this for real,

961
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:25,440
I would set a die goal of six months, like I'll hit six months no matter what.

962
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,480
But I would set a stretch goal of three months.

963
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:31,560
I think you could set a goal if you really, really eliminated all the

964
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,320
distractions, you put your head down and went to work.

965
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,480
And this is all you focused on.

966
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,920
I think you could do it in three months.

967
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,800
OK, I think you could.

968
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,320
You'd really have to push.

969
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:43,600
But I think if you wanted to, you could do it in three months.

970
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,200
Now, somebody is going to quote me and say,

971
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,400
oh, you said I could get to 20K in three months.

972
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:50,360
No, I said that if you put your head down and you freaking nailed it,

973
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:52,360
you could. But no, most people aren't going to do that.

974
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:56,400
OK, that is, guys, the my.

975
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:58,720
That's what I would do.

976
00:45:58,720 --> 00:45:59,840
You guys ever heard you,

977
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,960
Porto, have you heard that show called Undercover Boss, Grant Cardone?

978
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:05,480
Yeah. He got dropped in frickin what?

979
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:07,840
Somewhere in Colorado. You should know.

980
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,400
Frickin was a boulder.

981
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,680
I think it was Boulder with like a hundred bucks.

982
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:14,080
And he's supposed to create like whatever business.

983
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:17,720
That would be my if you said today you got no money.

984
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,720
You got to get a twenty thousand dollar business in three months.

985
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,240
That's it right there.

986
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:25,240
That's what I'm doing every second of every day.

987
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,800
I'm waking up and I'm cranking it out, baby.

988
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,880
I'm putting in my headphones, listen to a little

989
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:34,040
focus music on Spotify and just, you know,

990
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:36,720
maybe throwing in a couple of press ups every couple of hours.

991
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:39,720
That's it, dude. Just cranking away on the computer.

992
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,200
You can build guys.

993
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,720
I wish I could hold up my laptop with a laptop,

994
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:48,360
internet connection and some knowledge you guys can build.

995
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:51,320
You guys can escape the frickin rat race. Right.

996
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:54,000
Those of you that are on this call right now that had to go to work today

997
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:55,360
that hated every second of it.

998
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:57,440
And you're like, I can't wait for that live to see if there's a way

999
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,520
I can do it. You can.

1000
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:02,520
You can. You just got to put in the work. Right.

1001
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:05,680
And we have literally the model and the and I just gave you guys

1002
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:09,240
literally a an exact game plan for how to do it.

1003
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,280
Now you just got to execute. OK.

1004
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,640
So, guys, once again, for those of you that didn't catch it,

1005
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:17,840
rank and retire dot com, if you guys love the free group

1006
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:20,640
and you want to continue it, that is what that's transition to.

1007
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,840
It is paid. It's and you know what?

1008
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,920
Again, I don't care if we go from six thousand.

1009
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,960
I don't care. By the end of the week, we go from six thousand

1010
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,520
two hundred people in the free group.

1011
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:32,160
And I only have fifteen people inside of that community

1012
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:35,240
because those fifteen people are the ones I want to work with.

1013
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:37,240
Those are the people I'm going to give my time to my attention to.

1014
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:39,080
Those are the ones that want to work because they're putting their money

1015
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:39,840
where their mouth is.

1016
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:41,920
And I promise you, they're going to consume that content

1017
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:45,480
way more than the people that are the lucky lose and the frickin parasites

1018
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:47,640
that have been, you know, infesting this group.

1019
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:49,800
And I'm not saying you guys, because if you're on this call,

1020
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,720
then I don't necessarily think that's you. OK.

1021
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:54,240
Hordy, ready to do some giveaways?

1022
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:55,520
I'm ready. Let's do it.

1023
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:58,040
Guys, who wants some free stuff?

1024
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:00,480
Who wants some frickin free stuff?

1025
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,400
Let's let's see.

1026
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:05,280
Let's go ahead. I want to ask some questions.

1027
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,000
I like to give away free stuff by asking questions.

1028
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,040
By the way, Moza, what's up?

1029
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:12,000
This is my buddy from South Africa.

1030
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:13,600
He's he's at three a.m.

1031
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,520
So he's even beat me.

1032
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,520
What's up, dude? Been a minute.

1033
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:21,480
OK, let's give away some stuff.

1034
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,480
Let's start off by giving.

1035
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:28,560
What should we give away first, Porter?

1036
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:29,880
I want to give away some good stuff.

1037
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:33,080
Let's let's start off by giving away the swag.

1038
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:35,760
Then we're going to give away the

1039
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:38,600
the two, the two, three month membership to rank in an engine.

1040
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:40,560
And then I'm going to tell you guys what we're going to do

1041
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:42,840
for the partial scholarship. How does that sound?

1042
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,920
Oh, we also got to give away the copies of the exclusive trade.

1043
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:46,880
OK, let me ask you this.

1044
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:50,480
Who wants who's interested in the

1045
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:54,000
I've got this 12 part exclusive training series.

1046
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,960
We covered all kinds of different topics inside.

1047
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:59,960
This is these are completely separate.

1048
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:02,200
You guys never saw these unless you were on those trainings.

1049
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:04,400
And I don't think anyone was on every single week.

1050
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,320
It's a 12 part series.

1051
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:10,480
It's about 12 hours, maybe closer to 13 hours on all kinds of different topics.

1052
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:11,960
I'm going to give away five copies of that.

1053
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:14,240
Let's get that away first.

1054
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:17,200
Who's if you're interested in that,

1055
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,360
drop the word training.

1056
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:24,400
OK, if you're interested in swag, drop the word swag.

1057
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,680
And don't you dare put swag in training.

1058
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:28,960
OK, training or swag?

1059
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,920
Which one? Which ones? What are you guys interested in?

1060
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:32,400
OK, let's see.

1061
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,720
Let's see, let's see, let's see, let's see.

1062
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:38,720
OK.

1063
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:45,560
Jahill says any hoodies available, the hoodies.

1064
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:47,800
It's not because I don't want to give away.

1065
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:50,800
It's because the hoodies are for it's the 10K club.

1066
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:53,800
So if you see somebody rocking a hoodie, they're in the 10K.

1067
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:56,560
So other than that, I would have I would have said yes.

1068
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:01,160
OK, so let's go.

1069
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:05,240
Carl. So, Ashley, I need you to be taking notes here.

1070
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:09,520
Carl Giambri says he wants free stuff.

1071
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:14,080
So let's do for him, let's give him a mouse pad.

1072
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:17,920

Let's do a mouse pad.

1075
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:29,640
By the way, if you guys don't want the mouse pad, you want the coffee mug.

1076
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:31,040
I'm actually just going to say swag.

1077
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:34,320
Ashley, you can give away a mouse pad,

1078
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:37,080

You can let them choose.

00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:43,520

Carl Giambri, let me just hold my phone.

1085
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:53,480
I'm just making a fool of myself.

1086
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:58,520

Just message Ashley.

She's getting you.

1096
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,160
Guys, by the way, if you're a winner, reach out to Ashley.

1097
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,240
She's going to get you sorted out.

1098
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:39,320
OK. I don't see anyone else for swag.

1099
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:41,400
Let's give away some training.

1100
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:42,800
Porter, give me some names.

1101
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,560
We've got five copies of the training.

1102
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:48,840
Actually, I only gave away like five, six swag.

1103
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:52,280
So I'm down to give away 10 of the training.

1104

Boom, OK. So let's do it.

00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:55,720
You give me a name, I'll give a name.

00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:56,960
We'll go like that.

I'm going to give Gary Treister training

1114
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:30,400

1117
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:37,040
And I freaking appreciate you, brother.

And yes, if you're my client on this call, you're going to get both.

1122
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,440
Let's give out who else?

00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:52,480
You say Ali Borden already?

1124
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,640
No, I didn't say that one. Ali Borden training.

00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:58,880

Just hit me up, bro.

Anyone in digital landlords, by the way, you just get it.

Anything we do in this stuff or the Rankin Academy, you just get already.

00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:09,160
So don't worry about that.

Ashley, I think we've got like two more.

1140
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:40,360
Gina says she's working her ass off towards the hoodie.

1141
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:41,720
By the way, that hoodie slaps.

1142
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:42,760
It's not even the feel.

1143
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:44,360
It's just knowing you got the hoodie.

1144
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:49,760
Two more training Porter.

1145
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:53,200
Moza, Moza, my man in South Africa, I'm going to choose him.

1146
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:56,160
And then Porter, do one more.

1147
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:57,560
Let's do Edda Chapman.

1148
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:00,640
Is she an individual?

1149
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:02,200
She's an individual. She might be an individual landlord.

1150
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:03,440
If she is, I think she is.

1151
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:04,440
She's an unemployable.

1152
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:07,680
She's not. And OK, give her the training.

1153
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,160
OK, cool.

1154
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:12,680
Well, then, if I said she should be an individual, I was gosh dang it.

1155
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:14,440
Edda, come on. Just kidding.

1156
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:15,640
You should be.

1157
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:16,840
It should be.

1158
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:19,840
I think I think we did.

1159
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:20,840
OK.

1160
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,560
That's that. So, guys, we did that.

1161
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:25,520
Now, what I want to know is we're going to give away

1162
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:30,400
two. This is just two, three, three free months of RankinRan engine,

1163
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:33,600
which I referred to earlier in the call.

1164
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:37,120
OK, two copies or two memberships.

1165
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:38,760
It's three months free.

1166
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,240
And it's for two people only.

1167
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:44,320
I have to be really stiff on this because Ryan, the one that created

1168
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:47,120
the training, said it's good for just two people.

1169
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:48,320
So let's see.

1170
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:51,400
Again, guys, if you won, if I called your name, message Ashley,

1171
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:53,120
she'll get you taken care of. We got this.

1172
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:54,120
Then we're going to give away.

1173
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:56,160
We're going to tell you guys about the partial scholarship.

1174
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,880
We're going to wrap it up and we'll we'll go get back to work.

1175
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:02,680
OK, yeah, guys, don't leave it on Ashley.

1176
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:03,680
She's writing it down.

1177
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:06,680
But if you want something, you got a message, Ashley, please.

1178
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:09,480
So that she can get it to you guys and she's going to have a bunch of work.

1179
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:11,560
So be patient with her. I'm giving her a ton of work.

1180
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:12,560
Thanks, Ashley.

1181
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:13,560
I'm going to leave it on Ashley.

1182
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:14,560
She's writing it down.

1183
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:17,080
But if you want something, you got a message, Ashley, please.

1184
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:18,120
Thanks, Ashley.

1185
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:22,320
Kevin Mead just says he never got his last swag.

1186
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:26,240
That should be a confusion because that's that's that's

1187
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:28,720
that's literally a drop shit like he just goes to you.

1188
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:30,640
So just message Ashley, bro.

1189
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:34,760
No worries. And we can tell, by the way, Kevin Mead, if you did get it before.

1190
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,800
So we know if you're lying, bro.

1191
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:40,320
And I will I will know we can, though, for real. OK.

1192
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:46,320
OK. Let's see.

1193
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:51,280
Let's see. Whoa, lots of comments.

1194
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:57,840
Let's do.

1195
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:01,680
Shane Noble, I think, is one of the

1196
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:06,560
as a rank and rent engine, three month, three month free.

1197
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,000
Moza said training one more time.

1198
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,120
Moza, you already won the training.

1199
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:15,360
Just message Ashley. I got it for you, bro.

1200
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,720
Yeah, message Ashley just on Facebook.

1201
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:32,080
And. Let's also do.

1202
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:33,560
Who's this?

1203
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:38,960
Christian Story, second winner on rank and rent engine.

1204
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,120
You still with me, Porter?

1205
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:47,440
Yeah. Crazy, it's two a.m., dude, and we're freaking cooking.

1206
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,040
There's no way I'm going to be able to sleep tonight.

1207
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:50,040
I love it.

1208
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:52,920
Yeah, dude, you boy got dressed up today.

1209
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:55,120
All right, guys, let's talk about the partial scholarship.

1210
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:56,720
Just real quick.

1211
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,640
We're going to talk about the partial scholarship.

1212
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:00,680
All right, guys, let's talk about the partial scholarship

1213
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:04,720
just real quick, just so that when the winner is chosen,

1214
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:08,200
no one's like, oh, it's not this isn't an entire scholarship.

1215
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:09,200
It's a partial scholarship.

1216
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:12,160
So you are going to get a partial scholarship.

1217
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:14,520
That's what it means. OK, here's what we're going to do,

1218
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:17,880
because we don't know necessarily who's applied in the past, whatever.

1219
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:20,320
So this is what we found to be the easiest thing as we discussed it.

1220
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:24,080
If you are interested in the partial scholarship,

1221
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
need you to do two things. OK,

1222
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:30,440
I need you to send the following to Francesca on a message.

1223
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:32,560
If you send it to me, we're not going to see it.

1224
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:37,480
Send it to Francesca Ravinelli, our Italian stallion from Frickin.

1225
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:39,960
I think she's from Trento, Italy.

1226
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:42,760
She is amazing. She does all of the stuff for my agency.

1227
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:45,840
She's responsible for a lot of our success, if not all of it.

1228
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:49,160
I need you to message her if you are interested in the partial scholarship.

1229
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:50,440
And I need you to say two things.

1230
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:52,680
Number one is what you do for work right now.

1231
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:55,720
It's a business. If it's a job, what the job is, whatever.

1232
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:57,040
Just tell her what you do for work.

1233
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:59,840
And number two, why you think you deserve the partial scholarship.

1234
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:01,840
OK, that's it.

1235
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:05,960
And I will tell you that I will let her decide.

1236
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:08,280
I'm going to let her read all of them.

1237
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:09,480
She's going to be able to.

1238
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:13,440
I'm going to give her the the complete autonomy to decide based on the answers.

1239
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:15,760
Who is the winner of the partial scholarship?

1240
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:18,120
She will reach out to you. We'll announce it to just so everyone knows

1241
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:19,640
that we actually did choose a winner.

1242
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:22,040
She'll reach out to you, let you know you on the partial scholarship.

1243
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:24,440
For me, just to choose someone randomly.

1244
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:27,720
And then if, you know, they've already applied or whatever,

1245
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:29,840
it just didn't make sense. It's kind of a waste of time.

1246
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:32,040
So if you guys are interested in the partial scholarship,

1247
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:36,040
digital landlords, partial scholarship and go message Francesca

1248
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:41,920
and tell her what you do for work and why you think you're deserving of it. OK.

1249
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:46,440
So, guys, with that said one more time, for those of you that are new,

1250
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:48,440
just getting on the call, let me get some water here.

1251
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:53,960
The free group, the art of pre-selling,

1252
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:57,760
as it was formerly known right now, called the Art of Digital Real Estate

1253
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:02,520
is no more. All of the training, all of me going live

1254
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:05,680
150 plus times are done. They're gone.

1255
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:08,280
It's done. It's over. It was fun.

1256
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:09,800
We had a great ride.

1257
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,920
No one appreciates what they don't pay for.

1258
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:14,840
If you are interested in still being part of the community

1259
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:19,360
and what it has evolved to in version 2.0, if you are not in digital lands,

1260
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:21,200
if you're in digital landlords, you're not going to pay for it.

1261
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,200
We're going to try to sort out how we get you guys all in there.

1262
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:25,640
So don't worry. You're going to have access to everything.

1263
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:30,480
If you're not in digital landlords, go to rankandretire.com.

1264
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:36,600
You can also go to school.com SKOL and search for Rank and Rent Academy.

1265
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:38,520
Either way, go check it out.

1266
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:41,280
I've got a about little blurb on about.

1267
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:45,400
There's a video, a nine minute video that explains a little bit more into.

1268
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:50,920
Excuse me, bud, a little more into what we cover in there.

1269
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:55,320
But guys, people that pay for stuff, they value it more.

1270
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:57,840
And I'm telling you right now, I do not care about the numbers.

1271
00:59:57,840 --> 01:00:02,600
I don't care if there's three, two, one person, ten people, fifteen.

1272
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:05,360
I don't care if we go from six thousand two hundred down to ten.

1273
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:07,920
Does not matter because I know those ten people. I'm stoked.

1274
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:08,920
I'm going to mess it.

1275
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:11,320
We're going to you're going to get a very personal feel for me.

1276
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:12,840
And for those of you that are wondering,

1277
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:15,040
what's the difference between digital landlords and

1278
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:18,760
Rank and Rent Academy, the new community, everything.

1279
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:22,280
OK, just like the free group and the digital landlords, everything.

1280
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:27,040
However, I will tell you, there's all new training inside of the Rank and Rent Academy.

1281
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:29,360
We've got a bunch of stuff that we didn't have before.

1282
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:32,840
And we are going to be loading every single live that I ever did.

1283
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:36,560
Ever in the free group, 150 plus lives,

1284
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:40,640
150 plus hours, way more than that, actually,

1285
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:45,920
into the vault and also into the the interview series.

1286
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:48,240
OK, community world map, all that good stuff.

1287
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:50,640
I'm going to be going live once a week, which we used to do.

1288
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:54,880
Now I feel excited to go live because if you're paying to be there,

1289
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:56,800
you better be on the freaking live.

1290
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:58,480
So, guys, go hop in there.

1291
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:02,560
Rank and Rent Academy, Rank and Retire dot com.

1292
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:05,760
Check it out. Now, what I want to do, Porter, you got ten minutes.

1293
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:09,000
Yeah, we're good. Since this is our last call,

1294
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:12,960
I want to just I want to see if anyone has any final questions.

1295
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:16,160
Ten minutes. I'm going to give ten minutes any questions.

1296
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:17,640
Maybe we'll give away a little more swag.

1297
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:21,640
I don't know. But if anybody has questions, I want to just answer them.

1298
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:23,240
I really, really, really.

1299
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:26,560
I hope you guys know I really poured my heart and soul into this community.

1300
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:32,480
I have spent so many freaking hours just just commenting,

1301
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:35,160
just answering questions, just reading posts.

1302
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:39,280
I don't know if you guys know of any other free communities out there

1303
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:42,520
that had paid admins.

1304
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:44,080
OK, fix it.

1305
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:48,320
Felix was not a free, but it was somebody I paid somebody

1306
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:52,640
on my personal team that I paid every week to go and service the free group.

1307
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:55,640
We put a lot in that, man.

1308
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:59,080
I put so many hours in that and it was a back and forth, back and forth.

1309
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:02,680
Should we get rid of it? Should we not?

1310
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:04,640
Guys, I wish we didn't have to get rid of it.

1311
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:05,920
It was it was amazing.

1312
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:06,840
It was such a good thing.

1313
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:09,680
But all good things come to an end, just like when you give a business

1314
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:12,400
owner free leads and they stop.

1315
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:16,240
They think they can do it on their own or they stop appreciating it.

1316
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:17,560
It kind of loses its sizzle.

1317
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:19,280
It lost its sizzle, man.

1318
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:20,680
It was it was a great run.

1319
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:22,040
But let's go build an amazing community.

1320
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:23,960
Let's go build the rank and run academy.

1321
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:26,280
For those of you that are actually serious about learning this model

1322
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:28,440
that want to go to the next level, I'll see you in there.

1323
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:30,800
OK, let's see if there's any questions really quick.

1324
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:34,000
Eight minutes. We're done. OK.

1325
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:37,400
All right.

1326
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:39,840
Pat says, if you're sending ads.

1327
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:42,600
To a B.O.

1328
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:45,720
And you fail to land the deal, what do you do with the ad campaign?

1329
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:47,960
What do you do, Porter?

1330
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:51,560
If I failed, read it one more time.

1331
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:54,720
You're running you're sending ads to a B.O.

1332
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:55,880
And you failed to land the deal.

1333
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:57,840
What do you do with the ad campaign?

1334
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:01,200
I find I find another business owner from getting leads

1335
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:03,800
and I didn't sell the first business owner.

1336
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:05,840
I'll go and try to find another business owner.

1337
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:07,680
And most likely, it was something that I did.

1338
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:08,720
It's not the area.

1339
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:10,400
So don't give up on the area.

1340
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:12,320
If you're getting leads, keep trying.

1341
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:14,760
There's always an option to find a business owner.

1342
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:16,880
Yep. Same same exact answer.

1343
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,440
I knew I figured you'd answer like that.

1344
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:21,680
So I said that, by the way, Chandler Christensen, how do we get the replay?

1345
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:25,800
I would love to just post a link right now because

1346
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:30,880
it would be the easiest thing, but we're still recording the replay, unfortunately.

1347
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:35,040
So what you're going to have to do is anybody that wants it.

1348
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:37,160
You're going to message Ashley.

1349
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:38,440
Actually, I am so sorry.

1350
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:39,840
She's going to get a million messages.

1351
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:41,240
She's going to kill me.

1352
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:45,400
Message Ashley as soon as this calls over and ask for the replay.

1353
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:46,560
Give her a little bit of time.

1354
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:48,400
Just say the word replay for the love.

1355
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:51,080
Just say the word replay so she can just send you the link and move on to the next one.

1356
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:54,600
But you can get it there if you're on this call right now. OK.

1357
01:03:57,480 --> 01:04:00,720
Carl says you talked about running ads and then building out a site.

1358
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:04,920
We're starting with a small site, then transitioning to move to a permanent site after you.

1359
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:10,080
Yeah. So that's what you do is you start out with a you start out with a landing page.

1360
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:12,640
You run the ads through landing page, you get the deal, then you build up the site.

1361
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:17,240
What I was telling you, if I was going to go to 20K, I would that would be my primary focus.

1362
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:23,000
But I'd also try to go for my my most low hanging fruit project or due diligence.

1363
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,280
And I would build that one out so I can get I could have one project

1364
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:29,440
ranking while I'm running ads and landing deals.

1365
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:31,200
OK, because I want to have both.

1366
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:35,440
Right. I've started to realize, like, as an agency, you want to have all kinds of different stuff moving.

1367
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:42,960
OK. Matthew says, no questions, been binging your podcast and learned a ton,

1368
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:45,080
thinking about applying, but not sure on cost.

1369
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:47,200
We'll think it over. No problem.

1370
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:49,000
Matthew, send me a message.

1371
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:53,840
Actually, you know what, Matthew, by the way, anybody on this call,

1372
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:58,640
that is has a question or that needs any further help.

1373
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:01,600
Porter, are you down to do a couple of calls?

1374
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:05,120
Yeah, I'm going to drop my phone number in the chat.

1375
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:07,720
Drop. Porter's going to drop his phone number.

1376
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:14,160
Matthew, you specifically message Porter, jump on a call with him and ask any questions

1377
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:18,520
that you have and he'll answer for you. OK, so don't just do that.

1378
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:20,320
And that's actually Porter's cell phone.

1379
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:24,280
So if you guys want to go drop it in, like, you know, those things in the mall, like you

1380
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:28,320
you win a free motorcycle, go drop his number in those and then he'll get spammed for life.

1381
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:31,600
So, yeah, Matthew, do that.

1382
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:35,160
Edgar says you've done a great job with all the teaching.

1383
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:36,520
Bless you, Edgar. Bless you.

1384
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:41,000
Stephanie says, I just joined the free community.

1385
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,080
Am I the reason it's ending?

1386
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:45,240
L.O.L. Stephanie, no, please don't feel like that.

1387
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:47,440
It's literally just a timing thing.

1388
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:53,320
But I promise you that you will get way more out of this, even if it's 50 bucks,

1389
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:56,640
because you're spending it, you are going to get more out of it.

1390
01:05:56,640 --> 01:06:00,320
I know it sounds like, oh, Nick's just making an excuse to make more money.

1391
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:09,320
Guys, I've had people come to me that want to, you know, these are people that are really close to me.

1392
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:12,520
Let's say family, friends, friends that are really close to me.

1393
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:16,400
Want to, you know, these are people that are really close to me.

1394
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:18,760
Let's say family, friends.

1395
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:23,080
And I promise you and they're like, hey, I want to learn this business model, right?

1396
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:24,320
I want to get into this.

1397
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:26,400
I want to learn. I want to do what you do.

1398
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:30,720
And I promise you on my kid's life, it's not about the money.

1399
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:35,440
And every part of me wants to just be like, you know, just here's the password, homey hook up.

1400
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:37,800
Like that whole thing.

1401
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:43,840
But I'm telling you right now that it doesn't work because they never open it.

1402
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:46,400
They never, they never, ever open it.

1403
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:47,520
They never take it.

1404
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:51,200
But when you have skin in the game, even if it's a little bit of skin, you're like,

1405
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:52,440
I'm going to get into this community.

1406
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:55,280
I'm going to go freaking do the like you're going to go through the modules.

1407
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:57,960
By the way, in the first mini course, it has some homework.

1408
01:06:57,960 --> 01:06:59,160
Do all the freaking homework.

1409
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:01,960
Has you go drop while you're in the group, blah, blah, blah.

1410
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:03,080
Go do all that.

1411
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:04,880
But you're going to go watch all the mini courses.

1412
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:08,600
You're going to go do all that stuff because you've you've paid to be there.

1413
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:12,960
Right. Even if it's a little over a dollar a day, you're going to go freaking squeeze

1414
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:15,560
that thing for what it's worth because you spent money on it.

1415
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:17,960
OK. So, yeah, it's not because of you, Stephanie.

1416
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:24,600
Jahill says you should call this live, the giant pullback.

1417
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:30,160
That's a cool name, but it's not a pullback because we're actually ending the group.

1418
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:34,840
No question. Just thank you, Ali.

1419
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:36,000
Thank you for that comment.

1420
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:40,360
Let's see.

1421
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:47,280
OK, Kenneth says, thanks so much, Nick and team question.

1422
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:50,800
How would you respond to a business owner saying, why don't you do ads

1423
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:55,560
slash SEO on my website instead of building your own separate site that I don't own?

1424
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:57,960
How would you convince them about the business model?

1425
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:00,240
Kenneth, what I would say is I can.

1426
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:02,000
I can do I do both.

1427
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:05,640
But the reason I'm doing this is because it's going to be a lot more

1428
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:06,920
affordable for you.

1429
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:10,640
And the only reason you want me to do any work on your website

1430
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:11,920
is because you want leads.

1431
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:15,280
So if you want, I can go and do a bunch of stuff and send you a report,

1432
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:17,160
whatever on your website is going to cost you a lot more.

1433
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:19,040
And it's going to be a 12 month contract.

1434
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:23,280
Or I can build my own website, get you what comes from the website,

1435
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:25,640
which is leads, and you pay a lot less.

1436
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:26,440
You're renting it for me.

1437
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:28,800
So but yeah, and if you want to, I'll give you a price on it.

1438
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:30,280
And I'll quote them super high.

1439
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:31,880
And if they say yes to that, I'll just do that.

1440
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:36,440
And then I'll still sell them a lead gen it later.

1441
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:39,840
Never say no, there's always an option.

1442
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:41,120
100 percent.

1443
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:45,280
Porter's number four, three, five, three, nine, three, five, six, nine, four.

1444
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:47,440
Everyone drop it into a spam filter, please.

1445
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:50,600
Just not the insurance one to the marketplace.

1446
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:52,960
We can smoke you.

1447
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:55,880
Steve Wall, have you been seeing exact match domains

1448
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:58,400
getting smacked this most recent Google update now?

1449
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:02,080
Not really, but I'm not super spammy like that.

1450
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:07,480
And I'm not saying that spammy, but if I did get an exact match domain,

1451
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:09,040
I didn't do anything else that was spammy.

1452
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:15,560
Kevin says, if we're in DLL course, Kevin, what it means is you're going to have access.

1453
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:19,240
But listen, if you're in DLL, that's the advanced stuff.

1454
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:20,840
That's where you want to be anyway.

1455
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:25,040
So you think you're going to have access to this, but it's not.

1456
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:27,440
It's not it.

1457
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:30,200
You're going to want to stay in digital landlords where the values are.

1458
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:33,960
So you're not you're going to again, free access for life.

1459
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:36,160
You get all the value if you want to go check it out.

1460
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:40,760
But yeah, you're not you're not going to probably even spend that much time.

1461
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:42,960
You can. OK, so you get it for free. Don't worry.

1462
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:48,720
Brandon says he also just joined yesterday.

1463
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:50,680
Awful timing.

1464
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:54,560
And Annie says, I've loved your podcast, said I don't have them anymore.

1465
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:55,640
Oh, they're coming.

1466
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:58,800
By the way, I recorded one on Saturday night here in Africa.

1467
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:04,000
It was a 22 minute podcast and 18 minutes in the power went out, lost it.

1468
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,240
OK, unfortunately, I haven't had a time this week at all

1469
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:09,920
as I've been preparing for this live to record it.

1470
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:11,080
But you're going to see them again.

1471
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:13,280
So keep an eye on it. And he appreciate that.

1472
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:16,000
Steve says he appreciates all the freebies.

1473
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:19,240
Yeah, Isaac did say Isaac says Nick's been doing a pullback

1474
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:22,280
warning about this for a year. Finally, I'm doing it.

1475
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:23,600
Everyone thought I was lying.

1476
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:25,480
Guys, I appreciate you being on.

1477
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:29,880
Ma says bike away.

1478
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:31,320
You're welcome, brother.

1479
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:37,960
Steve says, so we wouldn't be buying a bike.

1480
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:39,520
We wouldn't be buying a bike.

1481
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:42,080
We wouldn't be buying a bike. We wouldn't be buying a bike.

1482
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:44,560
We wouldn't be buying a bike. We wouldn't be buying a bike.

1483
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:46,560
He says, so we wouldn't be buying both digital

1484
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:48,720
landlords and the school group, or do you recommend them both?

1485
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:52,440
Well, I know that question, guys.

1486
01:10:53,680 --> 01:10:57,720
This school is just the community is just like the free group, right?

1487
01:10:57,720 --> 01:11:00,800
It's not going to have every single thing that digital landowners are going to have.

1488
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:02,360
It's not going to cover in depth.

1489
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:05,440
It's a introduction to rank and rent.

1490
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:08,280
It's a community. It's me going live.

1491
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:11,280
It's it's it's got many courses.

1492
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:13,400
It's got a vault with all the old stuff.

1493
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:16,800
It is for all intents and purposes, the Facebook group

1494
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:19,400
converted into a community.

1495
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:22,440
But now, because I'm working with committed people,

1496
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:25,360
I'm I'm ready to go at it again. I'm ready to come go live.

1497
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:28,160
I'm ready to to give a ton of time, effort, energy,

1498
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:31,640
throw a bunch of resources at it.

1499
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:35,880
OK, digital landlords is like that's where you're going to end up.

1500
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:39,360
When you're ready from school, you'll end up in digital landlords.

1501
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:42,480
So if you're thinking about what should I do?

1502
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:44,640
You definitely are going to want to do digital landlords.

1503
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:46,920
The reason why we did school is because if you're brand new

1504
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:49,800
and you want to check it out, you want to build the community, blah, blah, blah.

1505
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:51,000
That's where that's at. OK.

1506
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,080
But again, for those of you that didn't catch this,

1507
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:56,840
if you're in rank and rent academy,

1508
01:11:57,680 --> 01:12:00,800
let's say for six months, 20 percent of the money that you spend

1509
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:03,960
when you decide to join digital landlords is going to be credited

1510
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:06,400
towards your membership

1511
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:09,360
and you're going to get that discount off of digital landlords. OK.

1512
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:11,920
Order anything else?

1513
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:14,400
No, I would say, guys, if you join school,

1514
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:15,720
you're going to get a message from me.

1515
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:18,000

1516
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:18,920
Feel free to message me.

1517
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:20,760
I'd love to get on one on one calls with you.

1518
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:22,840
And don't be thinking this is a sales call.

1519
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:23,920
It's strictly to help you.

1520
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:26,400
I already know eventually you're going to join digital landlords anyway.

1521
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:28,360
So I'm not going to try to push that on you.

1522
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:30,480
But I will give you the information that you need.

1523
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:32,080
But again, reply back.

01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:36,000
So yeah, orders in there. Jason's in there.

1526
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:39,040
Guys, you have these people that are doing 10K a month.

1527
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:40,640
They'll jump. They're giving you their cell phone number.

1528
01:12:40,640 --> 01:12:42,240
Hop on a call.

1529
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:44,760
And this is going to be in the school community exclusively.

1530
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:48,960
Hop on a call and ask them questions.

1531
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:51,080
If you have a niche idea, if you have, you know,

1532
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:54,280
I know Matthew had some questions about joining digital landlords,

1533
01:12:54,280 --> 01:12:57,560
stuff like that, any of that kind of stuff, jump on, ask them, feel free.

1534
01:12:57,560 --> 01:12:58,640
They're getting paid to do it.

1535
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:00,640
And they're happy to do it, adding value.

1536
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:02,800
So, guys, it's been freaking fun.

1537
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:05,480
It's two seventeen in the morning in West Africa.

1538
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:07,080
It's been a long week. I'm stoked.

1539
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:09,880
I'm going to wake up tomorrow and crank out these last two days.

1540
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:12,000
Twenty twenty five is the year, guys.

1541
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:16,200
Finally time to to sally up and hit those goals.

1542
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:17,600
