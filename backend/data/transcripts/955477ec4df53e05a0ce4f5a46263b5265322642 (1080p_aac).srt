00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
what's your question man so no honestly the course is amazing digital landlords i wish

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:12,720
i've been putting more time into it i'm so busy with sco clients and they take up so much of my

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:18,000
time i keep putting out fires every single day i just want to give a big shout out to you but

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,080
also want to ask you would you recommend kind of burning the boats and ditching some of these

5
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,680
clients in order to free up more time or do you have any recommendations for outsourcing

6
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:37,840
so i definitely like when i started scaling first of all is this it's kind of a contextual

7
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,720
question because if you need it to pay the bills and it's keeping you out of your job then that's

8
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:48,640
one thing but i also know that it could be the thing that's causing you not to scale because

9
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,840
your attention is definitely going to be split what i did again this is just from experience

10
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:59,600
is in 2020 when i started scaling is i found a strategic partner i created the strategic partner

11
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:05,840
it was my employee that was doing my seo he started a company we did a 50 50 split he would

12
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,680
sign the deal i'd sign the deals i'd send them to him i wouldn't talk to the client again he would

13
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:15,760
pay me 50 of the net profit that allowed me to keep some of the money but also just to focus

14
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:21,920
strictly on lead generation so that's what i did it worked out really really well i still was able

15
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,440
to make about and and every time i use i say i made 100k a month i hope you guys know that was

16
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:33,440
just with lead gen this was when i talked seo that was just like gravy um we did we were doing like

17
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:39,520
seven to twelve thousand a month my split of seo which means i could have taken 20 if i would have

18
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,560
done it myself but i just decided you know i could take 15 to 20 but i decided i'm going to take

19
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,880
half of that focus on lead gen because that's where i could actually scale so that's what i

20
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,760
would recommend as far as like outsourcing i don't really have any one that i've used that

21
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:59,520
i would recommend uh look i can ask around and and get that for you it's just difficult when

22
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,480
you're when you're doing like white labeling because people do the bare minimum uh you know

23
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:09,200
they just want to get paid and they don't really care uh but you can shoot me a message and i can

24
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,640
you know maybe there's some some some kind of a way we could you could even use my team

25
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,920
uh i don't know but yes if you want to send me a message i'm happy to do that man

26
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,720
