WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.560
First and foremost, I'm going to record the video.

00:05.560 --> 00:14.640
Guys real quick, what I want to do this year and especially, well, not especially, but

00:14.640 --> 00:19.560
just in general this year is I want to be, you know, we have our structured Tuesday lives.

00:19.560 --> 00:20.560
I always come prepared.

00:20.560 --> 00:26.920
I usually spend about an hour-ish preparing just for that Tuesday live.

00:26.920 --> 00:29.360
But there's a lot of stuff that I learned, a lot of stuff that comes to my mind, a lot

00:29.360 --> 00:34.520
of stuff that I'm learning as I'm trying to scale to a million dollars a month that I

00:34.520 --> 00:40.440
think you can take and you can bring down and extract the lessons and extract the principles

00:40.440 --> 00:41.880
and learn a lot.

00:41.880 --> 00:44.240
Not to say that I know everything, not to say that I'm the only one that knows how to

00:44.240 --> 00:45.240
do business.

00:45.240 --> 00:48.240
In fact, I probably don't know how to do business that well at all.

00:48.240 --> 00:50.400
I'm humble enough to admit that.

00:50.400 --> 00:53.400
But I do want to start sharing those things with you and sometimes I have this, you know,

00:53.400 --> 00:56.800
I have this big running list of like ideas of lives I want to do.

00:56.800 --> 00:59.080
So I'm going to change that a little bit.

00:59.080 --> 01:03.760
If I have something that I do or that I've learned or that's working for me, I'm just

01:03.760 --> 01:07.240
going to come live and share it and then leave it.

01:07.240 --> 01:08.240
And if you guys see it, great.

01:08.240 --> 01:09.240
If not, no worries.

01:09.240 --> 01:10.560
But I want to start doing more of that.

01:10.560 --> 01:11.560
So happy Monday.

01:11.560 --> 01:18.120
This is completely random this morning as I was, you know, I have my Monday stuff I do

01:18.120 --> 01:21.640
every single Monday that it makes my entire week more productive.

01:21.640 --> 01:25.480
I was doing that and I thought, you know what, this would be super instructive and I think

01:25.480 --> 01:28.400
very important and useful for people to hear.

01:28.400 --> 01:31.120
So Cindy says, can you can hear you?

01:31.120 --> 01:32.120
Happy Monday.

01:32.120 --> 01:33.120
Cindy, thank you.

01:33.120 --> 01:36.240
And my comments are only shown up on my phone, so I'm going to be, you know, going from here

01:36.240 --> 01:37.240
to here.

01:37.240 --> 01:38.240
Adair, what's going on?

01:38.240 --> 01:41.800
Glad to have a couple of people on, but I'm going to leave this live in the group so people

01:41.800 --> 01:43.140
can see this later.

01:43.140 --> 01:46.880
But really quick, what I want to share in the next like literally five, seven minutes

01:46.880 --> 01:53.200
is something that I do every single week, specifically every single Monday that allows

01:53.200 --> 01:55.200
me to get a ton of stuff done.

01:55.200 --> 01:56.200
OK.

01:56.200 --> 02:01.600
It's something that I've perfected over the years and I think it's a very it's a system

02:01.600 --> 02:04.400
that's worked really well for me and I just want to share it with you.

02:04.400 --> 02:10.920
OK, so I'm the type of person that I like to sit with my headphones on, undistracted

02:10.920 --> 02:15.040
phone off like the one of the reasons I like being in Dubai or Africa is because I'm so

02:15.040 --> 02:20.560
far ahead that by the time people can even wake up, I've already got a lot of that like,

02:20.560 --> 02:24.360
you know, that important work, the working on the business, not in the business stuff.

02:24.600 --> 02:28.640
I think it's very valuable where I can sit with my thoughts and solve problems and then

02:28.640 --> 02:30.720
create solutions for my company.

02:30.720 --> 02:38.360
However, sometimes I get a little bit too extreme with that and I end up like not utilizing

02:38.360 --> 02:40.560
what I have, the resources that I have.

02:40.560 --> 02:45.920
OK, so obviously within your business, you have different forms of leverage, right?

02:45.920 --> 02:49.200
Some of like, for example, there's money is a form of leverage.

02:49.200 --> 02:53.960
Media is a form of leverage and humans, human capital is a form of leverage.

02:54.280 --> 02:58.440
So what I want to just share with you really quick is how I how I get a lot of stuff done

02:58.440 --> 02:59.600
throughout the week.

02:59.600 --> 03:01.760
Actually, I get a lot of stuff done Monday through Wednesday.

03:01.760 --> 03:06.400
I get I get 90 percent of what I get done during the week, Monday through Wednesday.

03:06.400 --> 03:09.960
And they're very exhausting, but very busy days, very fulfilling days.

03:09.960 --> 03:10.680
But this is what I do.

03:10.680 --> 03:11.480
So I want to share really quick.

03:11.480 --> 03:18.040
OK, and maybe we may do a longer live that I can actually show you guys my screen.

03:18.040 --> 03:19.480
Nick Cudlick, what's going on, dude?

03:19.480 --> 03:21.200
Hopefully St. George's warming up.

03:21.200 --> 03:22.320
Good to see you guys on.

03:22.320 --> 03:23.280
So, guys, here's what I do.

03:23.320 --> 03:24.560
Every single Sunday.

03:24.560 --> 03:29.480
Now, I haven't been great at this at this this year, but it is something that I am

03:30.040 --> 03:31.560
like, no questions asked.

03:31.560 --> 03:34.320
I'm going to make sure that it is it is a non-negotiable for me

03:34.560 --> 03:36.800
because I'm going back and looking at what were the years I did the best?

03:36.800 --> 03:37.760
What's the years I grew?

03:37.760 --> 03:38.560
I grew the most.

03:38.560 --> 03:40.000
What's the years that I scaled the most?

03:40.000 --> 03:41.040
And what was I doing?

03:41.040 --> 03:45.240
OK, one of the things was I was very, very adamant about month

03:45.480 --> 03:49.200
weekly planning on Sunday and specifically early in the morning

03:49.440 --> 03:53.000
before kids were up, before church, before any of that kind of stuff.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.080
I was very, very disciplined about getting my planning done.

03:57.320 --> 03:59.520
OK. Now, what it does, guys, when you get your plan.

03:59.680 --> 04:02.040
By the way, this isn't a planning topic I'm talking about.

04:02.280 --> 04:04.440
But when you do that weekly planning, first thing in the morning,

04:04.960 --> 04:07.680
you know, when you're thinking, hey, I got to do my planning at 630 a.m.,

04:08.040 --> 04:11.560
it doesn't really encourage you or inspire you to go out on Saturday night.

04:11.640 --> 04:12.880
Right. That's one thing that I've learned.

04:12.880 --> 04:14.000
You get to bed a little bit earlier.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.200
You start thinking, hey, I got to get up.

04:15.200 --> 04:16.480
I got to get that done. OK.

04:16.480 --> 04:19.560
I like to do it in the morning because by the evening, I'm tired.

04:19.720 --> 04:21.040
My creativity is gone.

04:21.080 --> 04:25.520
And on top of that, you know, it's like I, you know, I want to be

04:25.520 --> 04:27.240
I want to give myself a chance to reset.

04:27.240 --> 04:29.680
So first thing that I do, guys, is Sunday morning.

04:29.680 --> 04:30.760
I plan out my entire week.

04:30.760 --> 04:34.000
I have a live that I've done in this group on my weekly planning,

04:34.000 --> 04:36.880
how I do my weekly planning, which you guys can go and you can find.

04:36.880 --> 04:38.920
You can check out. OK. So do that on Monday.

04:38.920 --> 04:42.880
Sorry. On Sunday, Monday, what I do is I set aside an hour.

04:43.080 --> 04:46.360
OK. And sometimes I break it up into 30 minute chunks.

04:46.360 --> 04:48.160
I'll do like 30 minutes. I'll take a five minute break.

04:48.160 --> 04:49.480
I'll do the other 30 minutes.

04:49.480 --> 04:53.000
But what I do, guys, is I have all of the human capital

04:53.000 --> 04:57.480
that I have access to, OK, which is my team. Right.

04:57.480 --> 05:02.640
So just some of the people you guys know, Francesca, Ashley, I've got

05:05.600 --> 05:08.000
Isaac, who is my video guy, I've got Porter.

05:08.360 --> 05:09.640
These are members of my team.

05:09.640 --> 05:11.120
This is my human capital for you guys.

05:11.120 --> 05:12.920
You may have your VA.

05:12.920 --> 05:16.880
You may have your content writer, whatever, whatever, whatever. Right.

05:16.880 --> 05:19.280
And for me, just so you guys know, I also have

05:20.120 --> 05:23.080
my team members that report to me that have their own team members

05:23.080 --> 05:25.560
that report to them, which is another layer of leverage.

05:25.560 --> 05:30.280
So what I do is I have a simple Google document and I title it

05:30.640 --> 05:35.080
2025 weekly priorities and I put the name of the person.

05:35.080 --> 05:37.720
So 2025 weekly priorities, Ashley.

05:38.200 --> 05:40.880
OK. 2025 weekly priorities, Isaac.

05:41.280 --> 05:44.720
And guys, what I do is I go and I look at my weekly plan

05:44.920 --> 05:48.440
and I sit there and I go, what things I look at my top three.

05:48.720 --> 05:52.080
I, you know, my big three that I do, and you guys have to watch my weekly

05:52.080 --> 05:53.600
planning live to understand what I'm talking about.

05:53.600 --> 05:55.840
But I look at my big three things I want to accomplish.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.320
And then I look at all my other tasks and I look and say,

05:58.520 --> 06:02.960
what can I get off of my plate, but still keep moving the needle forward?

06:02.960 --> 06:04.680
And there's things that I personally have to do.

06:04.680 --> 06:06.360
I have to record a podcast.

06:06.360 --> 06:08.880
I can't really outsource that because I'm the one doing it. Right.

06:09.040 --> 06:10.800
But I can outsource the planning.

06:10.800 --> 06:14.160
I can outsource maybe not even the planning, but I can outsource the

06:14.800 --> 06:17.600
the production and the schedule of the post and the commenting

06:17.600 --> 06:20.800
and making sure all of everything's dialed in and editing that I can do.

06:21.040 --> 06:24.840
So I look at my weekly priorities and my weekly planning.

06:25.600 --> 06:28.320
And I'm going to start assigning stuff to different people. Right.

06:28.560 --> 06:30.800
Ashley, this is this falls under her role.

06:30.920 --> 06:32.440
This falls under Francesca's role.

06:32.440 --> 06:34.800
This falls under Porter. This falls under Jason.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.120
This falls under, you know, my guy, Peter here in Africa.

06:38.320 --> 06:42.640
And I start divvying this stuff out and I put it into two categories.

06:42.640 --> 06:46.560
OK. First category I do is stuff that they need to work on.

06:46.560 --> 06:49.600
It's like creative juices.

06:49.920 --> 06:52.560
I need you to put your this is this is the priorities,

06:52.560 --> 06:56.600
the stuff that actually takes, you know, brain power and creativity.

06:56.800 --> 06:57.720
That comes first.

06:57.720 --> 06:59.960
And then underneath that, I call it the managerial stuff.

06:59.960 --> 07:03.160
That's hey, I need you to reschedule a flight for me.

07:03.360 --> 07:07.400
I need you to make sure this is posted stuff that doesn't take a lot of time.

07:07.400 --> 07:09.600
I need you to respond to the Facebook or the YouTube comments,

07:09.880 --> 07:12.720
stuff that doesn't really take a lot of thought, but that needs to be done.

07:13.000 --> 07:17.000
So each one of my team members, I have two different categories.

07:17.120 --> 07:21.480
I have my creative needle moving stuff and then I have my managerial stuff.

07:21.480 --> 07:25.000
And I go and I line them out every single week on Monday.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.880
First thing that I do, exactly the things that are priorities.

07:29.160 --> 07:31.240
And as long as I've communicated the goals of the company,

07:31.240 --> 07:34.880
the way the direction that I want to move as a company and the vision for the company

07:35.080 --> 07:38.440
and then they can see the weekly priorities, I can then go.

07:38.440 --> 07:42.200
And as soon as I've done that, what I'll do, you know, once they wake up

07:42.200 --> 07:47.360
or once I get a chance is I'll hop on with them for, you know, five, 10, 15 minutes.

07:47.360 --> 07:49.320
Like as soon as I get off this, I'm about to hop on with Francesca.

07:49.600 --> 07:51.040
I'm going to hop on with her.

07:51.040 --> 07:52.480
We're going to buzz through it really quick.

07:52.480 --> 07:55.560
And I'm going to clarify anything that she may have a question on

07:55.680 --> 07:57.920
or anything that I want to make sure she really understands.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.520
And then she goes to work.

07:59.520 --> 08:03.320
So for all of Monday, for Monday at 9am for the whole week,

08:03.320 --> 08:06.760
she's completely lined out and she's on her freaking business.

08:06.760 --> 08:08.440
She's doing the task. She knows what's important.

08:08.440 --> 08:10.000
She knows she needs to spend her time.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.080
And then also, guys, there's Francesca calling me right now.

08:12.320 --> 08:17.160
I'm also, well, I then I can go back to work on the stuff

08:17.160 --> 08:18.800
because I have two different categories.

08:18.800 --> 08:21.200
I have the stuff that's needle moving and creative, et cetera.

08:21.320 --> 08:24.160
And then I have the managerial stuff that's like, get the tax paper here.

08:24.360 --> 08:26.480
The only sign this that only I can do.

08:26.480 --> 08:31.840
And then, hey, let's figure out how we can come up with more clients in a one week period.

08:32.480 --> 08:34.520
Let's figure out how we can create better lives.

08:34.520 --> 08:36.640
Let's figure out we can redo this training.

08:36.640 --> 08:38.960
Those are my needle moving activities.

08:38.960 --> 08:40.720
And so, guys, I do this every single week.

08:40.760 --> 08:42.760
I line them out in their Google sheet.

08:42.920 --> 08:45.960
I try to do a quick phone call, a quick Zoom call with them.

08:46.440 --> 08:49.240
Some of the team members that it's really cut and dry do this, this, this and this.

08:49.240 --> 08:50.560
It's a lot of the same stuff every week.

08:50.560 --> 08:51.520
I don't need to do it.

08:51.520 --> 08:54.560
And sometimes and some of the people I have to get on a Zoom like Francesca,

08:54.560 --> 08:56.280
who keeps calling me, by the way.

08:56.280 --> 08:57.600
She's like, where are you at?

08:57.600 --> 09:00.040
And I make sure that we're on the same page.

09:00.200 --> 09:03.000
And guys, by doing this, you're duplicating yourself.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.120
You are then lining your team members out.

09:05.280 --> 09:06.920
It's like you're programming.

09:06.920 --> 09:10.000
I don't want to say a robot, but you're programming human capital

09:10.200 --> 09:11.800
that you're like, hey, do this, this, this and this.

09:11.800 --> 09:16.320
And you also have a very, you know, creative and strong brain.

09:16.320 --> 09:18.760
And these are my team members are really, really smart.

09:18.760 --> 09:19.680
Otherwise, they wouldn't be on my team.

09:19.680 --> 09:21.000
I wouldn't allow them to be on my team.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.280
And then they get to go and work on the stuff

09:23.440 --> 09:25.440
that is going to move the needle in those departments.

09:25.440 --> 09:27.920
And then guess what? On Friday, they send me a quick loom.

09:27.920 --> 09:30.440
If we don't zoom and they say, hey, here was this priority.

09:30.440 --> 09:32.200
Here's what I did. Here was this five minute loom.

09:32.200 --> 09:33.480
Put it on to speed.

09:33.480 --> 09:35.280
Watch it in two minutes. Done.

09:35.280 --> 09:37.960
This right here, guys, is something that I do every single week.

09:37.960 --> 09:40.200
So I've already done my weekly priorities for all my team members,

09:40.200 --> 09:41.920
my human capital.

09:41.920 --> 09:44.600
Now I got to do a couple of zooms and check in with them.

09:44.840 --> 09:47.600
And then I'll be checking in on Slack and stuff midweek.

09:47.760 --> 09:50.120
And then by the end of the week, we either do a quick phone call, zoom,

09:50.120 --> 09:52.400
or they send me a loom via email.

09:52.400 --> 09:55.520
Everyone on my team member sends me a loom on email or Slack.

09:55.520 --> 09:58.280
I then Monday morning or when I'm planning, I watch it quickly.

09:58.280 --> 09:59.920
I'm like, boom, they got everything done.

09:59.920 --> 10:03.880
And on to the next week, guys, this has allowed me to get a lot of stuff done

10:04.120 --> 10:07.080
leveraging human capital, which is something you're already paying for.

10:07.200 --> 10:09.440
If you're not taking the time to line up your VA and tell them

10:09.440 --> 10:11.800
exactly what they should be spending their time doing and the priorities

10:11.800 --> 10:14.640
that they should be, you know, the things they should be prioritizing.

10:14.920 --> 10:16.200
You're leaving a lot of money on the table.

10:16.200 --> 10:18.480
And there's a lot of stuff that could be getting done that's not.

10:18.480 --> 10:24.400
OK, so that said, guys, in lieu or in the same vein of what I'm talking about,

10:24.400 --> 10:25.600
I'm going to hop on with Francesca.

10:25.600 --> 10:29.320
We're going to go over our priorities and I'm going to keep cranking out work, guys.

10:29.440 --> 10:31.080
Happy freaking January.

10:31.080 --> 10:33.200
It's one of the greatest months to do deals.

10:33.200 --> 10:35.360
And I will see you guys tomorrow on the live.

10:35.360 --> 10:36.160
I'm out. See you guys.
