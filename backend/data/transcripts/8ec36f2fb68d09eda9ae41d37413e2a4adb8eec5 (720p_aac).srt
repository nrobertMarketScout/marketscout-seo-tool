1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Citations, okay?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
What are citations?

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I know that wasn't the question, but let's talk about citations.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I know we're going basic, guys, but citations.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Citations have to do with your Google My Business.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The reason why we put that on the due diligence at the top is because citations are,

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
you guys remember when you set up your Google My Business

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
and it asks you for the name, the address, and the phone number.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It's called the NAP, N-A-P, right?

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
That is the core.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
That is the basis.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
That is the gospel.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
That right there, that name, address, phone number,

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
what Google's doing in a citation is where else around the internet

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
is that name, address, phone number listed exactly like that?

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Is it Yellow Pages? Is it Facebook?

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Where, what places are those three things,

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
name, address, phone number, cited across the web, okay?

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And the number of those typically does matter, okay?

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The sheer volume of those.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So if you go look at citations, and one person has 5,000 citations,

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
which I've never seen, they typically have less than 50,

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
but let's say they have 500 citations,

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
that's going to be somebody that you need to look at that, okay?

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
But I want to clarify, citations have to do with the Google Maps,

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
have to do with ranking in the Google Maps section, not with the organic,

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
even though technically a high ranking in the Google Maps

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
will influence your organic ranking.

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
But when we're talking about citations,

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
and you look at the due diligence and it says citation,

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
we are referring to those things,

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
where is your name, address, phone number that shows on Google,

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
the exact one on Google, where else is it cited across the internet?

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And how many places is it cited?

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
That's citations, whereas backlinks is how many other websites

36
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
are backlinked to you basically raising their hand and saying,

37
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
hey, I endorse this guy, and I'm popular, I'm so-and-so, I'm Forbes,

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
and I endorse lasvegastreeservice.com, right?

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So that's the question there.
