Hey guys, so you guys are asking questions about how to know where to set up your daily

00:04.060 --> 00:05.060
budget.

00:05.060 --> 00:07.740
So I'm going to go through one of the ads that we have set up here.

00:07.740 --> 00:13.820
This is for a patio cover and we're going to just kind of show you how we set that up.

00:13.820 --> 00:18.340
So the big thing that we use to set that up as we go through the training is what your

00:18.340 --> 00:27.500
CPC is and bidding your CPC using tools like the Keyword Planner here is where we go and

00:27.500 --> 00:32.340
we learn how much the keywords are going to be and that will typically set us up for what

00:32.340 --> 00:34.780
our daily budget will be.

00:34.780 --> 00:41.220
When you go and you set up your ad and you set up your daily budget, you will have like

00:41.220 --> 00:49.300
right here we set up our daily budget of $45 a day and that was based on what our CPC was

00:49.300 --> 00:55.660
going to be and what we wanted to do for that area.

00:55.660 --> 01:04.180
So you can see here that this gives me a bunch of different options which anywhere from $23.26

01:04.180 --> 01:10.020
all the way up to $292 a day and it will give you how many clicks to expect and the cost,

01:10.020 --> 01:13.380
the impressions and how much to get to the top impression.

01:13.380 --> 01:15.640
So that is one way to look at it.

01:15.640 --> 01:21.260
We try to keep it between typically between $25 to $35 a day.

01:21.260 --> 01:24.860
This area is San Antonio, Texas so it's a little bit more but you can see here that

01:25.540 --> 01:31.620
we've been getting good results at $45 a day for our client and you can see here that Google

01:31.620 --> 01:34.180
is wanting to push us all the way up to $300 a day.

01:34.180 --> 01:35.700
So that's just where you need to apply that.
