Okay. Bernie, I haven't reached the end of my initial contracts yet for my first clients.

00:05.120 --> 00:11.280
Any tips to get the renewal? Yes. Super simple. I like to bump things up. I like to give them a

00:11.280 --> 00:16.080
lot of soft touches leading up six weeks, a month up. Sometimes I'll bump the ads up a little bit

00:16.080 --> 00:19.280
just to make sure they have a really good month. And then we have the conversation. And I make sure

00:19.280 --> 00:24.960
to have the conversation about four weeks to two weeks out so that if they don't want to renew,

00:24.960 --> 00:30.320
I have time to go find somebody else. But yeah, make sure that that last two weeks,

00:30.320 --> 00:35.360
four weeks before you have the chat is a good one. Okay. And not only that you send them a

00:35.360 --> 00:39.760
lot of leads, but that they're actually closing deals. You got to make sure to stay in touch with

00:39.760 --> 00:45.280
these people. Make sure to have a lot of soft touches during that first six months. And then

00:45.280 --> 00:50.480
once you re-sign into that year, dude, it becomes a lot easier. And that's the beauty is there is

00:50.480 --> 00:54.000
light at the end of the tunnel.
