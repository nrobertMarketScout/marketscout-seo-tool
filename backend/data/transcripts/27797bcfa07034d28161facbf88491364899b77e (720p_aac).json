{"text": " Zach, I have a client that wants to go into real estate, but it's too competitive in the city he wants. Do you ever tell people, no, because it's too competitive? Oh, all the time.

And I'd quote them at some astronomical price. And if they end up saying, love us, let's do it, do it, and then go outsource it, right? Kyle Goldstein has a ton of huge SEO clients. And it's because he charges ridiculous prices. And they say yes. Okay, so that's what I would do. Because you don't really need the deal.
