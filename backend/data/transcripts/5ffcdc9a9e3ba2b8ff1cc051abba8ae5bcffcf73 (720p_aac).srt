1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
the only other objection I got is more like I'm not on the spot kind of guy really that was about it

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,200
which that comes back back to like the building urgency right like I don't give a fuck if you're

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,640
on the spot guy or not uh I don't care I'm here to find it like like you're not saying this but

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:19,600
you're you're you're you're kind of like exuding this by how you're saying it you're like I don't

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,960
give a fuck what you you are aren't we have a call I have a call in an hour you know I do this

6
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:30,320
exclusively are you in or at shit or get off the pot motherfucker like that's the mentality you have

7
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:36,080
to have and again also comes back to think in your head going like I'm the one that has what he needs

8
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:41,360
there's 20 of him there's one of me so I call the shots here and and even though you want that deal

9
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,600
you want that fucking deal so bad you have to make it seem like you don't need that deal right last

10
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,160
question last thing I'm gonna say uh is mostly whenever I'm trying to do create the urgency is

11
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,120
I'll do like next day so a lot of things I hear people say is like in an hour in two hours and

12
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,520
three hours I feel like most of the time like with the last two guys we've had a reschedule

13
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,600
for a two hour because he'll be on a job for 5 p.m and they'll be like dude can we do 7 p.m and

14
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,480
I'll be like sure but I do have a call with the guy in the next two days one day so is it really

15
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,800
better to do it like right then like next three hours or one yeah what I usually say is like I'm

16
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:18,960
just like hey you know uh I got a call I'm supposed to do a call sometime tomorrow afternoon so I just

17
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,720
want to make sure we're good that way you're not tied down to a time and you can still and I also

18
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,400
like to call that company and just kind of have an open conversation and let hey whatever I'm

19
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,440
you know I'm probably going to be working with someone but would you be interested in taking

20
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:40,480
leads that way if he happens to know that business owner and he calls him it's not like oh he's lying

21
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,760
yeah I like that perfect
