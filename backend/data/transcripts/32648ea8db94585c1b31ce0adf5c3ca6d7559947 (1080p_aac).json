{"text": " When you are asked a question when you are explaining something or overcoming an objection You are not going to give an answer from you. You are going to give an answer from a client Let me repeat that when you answer an object when somebody asks you a question Okay, a client asks you a question. Hey, how are you different the home advisor? Hey, how does your pricing work? Hey, how do you guys do flat fee? Etc or when you are doing your screencast or you're overcoming an objection, you know is going to come up Instead of answering it just blah and this is what this is the answer You're going to take a little bit more time and you're gonna answer that question By using a client's answer to answer that question. Okay, that might be a sound a little bit confusing. It's really really simple Okay, let me give you an example Client asks you you jump on the phone. You're doing your prospecting. You're hooking the business owner Like we talked about in step three or sorry step four module four I'm losing my numbers here in module four where you're actually hooking the business owner You call them they're interested you go through the script and you're kind of at the end and they're one of those people that starts asking Questions, right they keep asking questions and you're trying to like avoid it, but they keep asking Okay, so business owner for example, they would say something like Okay So tell me real quick before we end this like how are you different than home advisor? Okay, most of us would start rambling on well We we don't we don't do shared leads number one, sir well, I Mean whatever the 17,000 different reasons and canned responses are we we work exclusively with one company We make sure the leads are qualified but whatever whatever the reasons are that you give of saying you're different than home advisor Once you respond they expect you to have a certain response like they know you've been asked So when you say it it is what it is But here's what you're gonna do is instead of answering that You know answering that question just the way that that you hear it or the way you understand it You're gonna use a client. Okay, so for example This is how you're gonna answer instead of saying yeah Well, we don't do exclusive leads you could say well, and this is kind of the response I like to give is if somebody says something like that and say hey, what's the difference between you and home advisor? Well, and I'd say something like well, basically the only thing that's the same as we work with contractors No, but for real and then this is what I would say I'd say so I'd say no But for real like we have a guy his name is Joe He's he's our duct cleaning client in Chicago. You can look up his site as Chicago duct cleaning And his biggest thing because he was working He was actually working just like you with home advisor for like three years His biggest thing and we just talked him last week is he's keep saying over and over is like dude Just the fact that I don't have to worry about Competing with four other companies in town and I have the lead exclusively to myself has made all the difference in the world So just so you know, we work with one company exclusively and we don't share the leads You say that guys you use it like that It's a little bit it takes a little bit more effort of thinking and it gets it gets easier But you use that and now it's not me saying it's Joe. It's Joe the duck cleaner in Chicago It not only does it hold way more weight, but it also builds authority and it removes the objection of trust Okay, it removes the objection of trust because now you're not just some random schmo That's in his mom's basement now. You're a human being that has other clients. You're a human being that has other clients in Chicago You're a human being that has other clients in duck cleaning, which is the same industry as this guy So just doing that simple thing you are removing this objection.
