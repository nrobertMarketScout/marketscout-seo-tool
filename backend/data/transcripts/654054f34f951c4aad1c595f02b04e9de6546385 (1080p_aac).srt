1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,720
When you do the hook, you call and you're like,

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,800
hey, I want to send you a couple of free leads.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,640
I saw you're paying for ads, blah, blah, blah.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,120
I've seen a couple of posts where some of you guys are like,

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,480
hey, I sent the client the first lead and it's been a week

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,560
and we haven't gotten a lead.

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:25,600
Quit pigeonholing yourself or painting yourself in a corner.

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,720
Do you know what I do?

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,360
I tell the business owner, I say, hey, look,

10
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,040
I want to get you a couple of leads, two, three, four leads,

11
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,800
and then let's talk.

12
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,440
And I want to make sure they're good leads.

13
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,160
So that might be in a couple of days.

14
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,400
That might take a couple of weeks.

15
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,720
I'm not really sure.

16
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,520
It just depends.

17
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,760
It kind of ebbs and flows.

18
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:47,480
If you just said that, if you sent them a lead the first day

19
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,400
and it took a week to send them the second lead,

20
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,840
they would be fine because they're like, oh, yeah,

21
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,160
he told me it might take a couple of weeks.

22
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,120
The problem is you guys, without meaning to

23
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,080
or maybe you are meaning to, you're like, hey,

24
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,240
I'm going to send you three leads.

25
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,240
I'm going to try and do it.

26
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,920
Let's talk on this day at this time.

27
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,720
And I understand if you guys have websites that are already

28
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,320
generating leads, you can do that.

29
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,360
But if you're running ads, guys, shit happens.

30
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,360
Competitors click on your ads.

31
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,640
Your ad accounts get suspended.

32
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,320
There's weird weather issues.

33
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,080
There's holidays.

34
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,080
There's recessions.

35
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,080
There's shit happening and wars and all

36
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,080
these different factors.

37
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,480
People get spooked and the Dow Jones goes down

38
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,240
and we don't know all the factors.

39
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,000
So quit painting yourself in a corner.

40
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,360
Let the business owner know, hey,

41
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,920
I'm going to get you two, three, four leads.

42
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,920
Then we're going to talk.

43
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,120
I'm hoping to talk in not too long,

44
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,840
but it might be a week or two.

45
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,160
It might be a couple of days.

46
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,040
I just want to send you a couple of good ones.

47
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,720
That sound fair?

48
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,960
Cool.

49
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,360
Then guess what?

50
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,560
In their heads, they're expecting it potentially

51
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,920
to take a couple of weeks.

52
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,560
And you might call them in three days

53
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,920
and have all the leads that they need to close the deal.
