00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,840
Another common question we get is, how long should we wait before you kill or stop a campaign?

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:10,280
So this is assuming that you've set up your ad correctly, that you did the proper due

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:14,040
diligence and you selected the right city and the right niche.

4
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,620
So assuming that those things are correct.

5
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:23,720
Remember that when we set up an ad campaign, the first two days is a policy review and

6
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:29,020
then the first five days after that is called a learning, it's in its learning phase.

7
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:35,220
So the first seven days of a new campaign is never really the best results that you're

8
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,940
wanting to get because Google is learning your ad.

9
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:44,780
So at a bare minimum, we say at least 14 days because that gives you at least one week of

10
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:50,080
landing your ads where they should be starting to land and you can start making any tweaks

11
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,340
and stuff like that.

12
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:57,340
For most of us that do this, we let our ads run from beginning to maybe when we're going

13
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:03,460
to pull it for three to four weeks after launch date because we like to have two full

14
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:08,140
weeks of running the ads out of the learning and the policy review phase.
