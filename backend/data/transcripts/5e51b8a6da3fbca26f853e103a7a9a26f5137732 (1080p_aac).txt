Kind of off topic, but how many times will you call back a lead to get info before you
just say F it and move on?
I left two voicemails to a lead.
I call seven times.
Seven is my magic number.
I have my Dylan telling, hey, after seven times, we can go ahead and assume this person
is not going to answer.
But when I call, just so you know, Chris, one call for me is I call, goes to voicemail,
I call again, I shoot a text and I leave a voicemail.
That's one call.
I do that seven times.
If after seven times, I move on.
I mark it as a bad lead.
Seven is the magic number.
I don't even know why.
I just came up with that.
So you could do whatever.
I do seven.
