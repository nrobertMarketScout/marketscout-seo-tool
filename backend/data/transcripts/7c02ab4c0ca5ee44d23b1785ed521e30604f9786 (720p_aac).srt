1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
Is it a good idea to start pitching before launching,

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:05,800
being able to provide leads?

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:06,640
Yeah, you can.

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,240
If you want the practice, you can.

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,720
I mean, I definitely think when you have a lead in hand,

6
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,280
it's the way that you say things

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,980
and the tone of your voice is different

8
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:17,720
because you actually have a lead.

9
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,440
You have the address.

10
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,840
You have the business, the customer's name.

11
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,160
You know the scope of work.

12
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,920
So I think it's more effective,

13
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,360
but have I gotten deals where we've done that?

14
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,280
And Lincoln, he helped me with some setting

15
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,760
a couple years ago, and we started doing that

16
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,600
and it worked.

17
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,760
So yeah, you can, but it's definitely more effective

18
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,220
if you have a lead in hand, just in my opinion.
