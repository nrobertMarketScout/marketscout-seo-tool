WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:14.720
Guys, let's go ahead and build our list. So hop over to the screen with me really quick.

00:14.720 --> 00:18.560
Okay, now that we're here, what we're going to do is obviously need to open up,

00:19.120 --> 00:25.040
hit the download, you know, open up the prospecting list template. And what I recommend doing is

00:25.040 --> 00:30.240
having it on your Google Drive and just having the template and making a copy every time. So

00:30.240 --> 00:35.120
that's what I've done is I made a copy of the prospecting list template and then I just name

00:35.120 --> 00:40.720
it accordingly. So what I'll typically do is like, I'll do this for multiple cities. I'll do one of

00:40.720 --> 00:46.640
these for like a state or a niche. So for example, this one would be, maybe I would do this one for

00:46.640 --> 00:54.480
concrete, right? So I would do prospecting list template, concrete, niche, right? And then down

00:54.480 --> 01:02.480
here, I would name this just a simple way to keep this straight. I do Queen Creek AZ, something like

01:02.480 --> 01:06.560
that. You can do it however you want. I've done everything, all the above, okay? Next thing you're

01:06.560 --> 01:10.960
going to want to do, it's very, very simple, very cut and dry, is I want you to put your keywords

01:10.960 --> 01:18.080
in here. And again, just tying this all together, if you remember when I talked, when we talked about

01:18.080 --> 01:22.400
the keyword list and why it's so important to have that dialed in and I really hope you guys

01:22.400 --> 01:26.320
didn't skip that part or didn't breeze over it. But if you did that correctly, everything else

01:26.320 --> 01:31.040
becomes easier. We use it over and over and over and over. And so hopefully you guys listen to what

01:31.040 --> 01:35.360
I said. Take that keyword list, take your core keywords and put them in here because those are

01:35.360 --> 01:40.480
what we're going to use to search to find these businesses. And then what's very, very simple is

01:40.480 --> 01:46.880
if you remember when we were doing the due diligence market research, we typed in the terms

01:46.880 --> 01:53.040
with the city. So concrete contractors, Queen Creek, concrete patio, Queen Creek,

01:54.000 --> 01:58.800
Queen Creek concrete, yada, yada, yada. So type all of them in just like we did in the beginning.

01:58.800 --> 02:04.000
Again, take your keywords, type them in with the city and state. And then it's really, really simple

02:04.000 --> 02:08.160
is we're just going to start looking, okay? We're going to start looking for businesses that are

02:08.160 --> 02:11.600
running ads. So for example, for those of you that aren't familiar with how this works,

02:11.600 --> 02:16.080
it's going to say ad. It's going to say ad. And once in a while, you're going to see an ad here

02:16.080 --> 02:21.200
in the, what's called the Google local listing or the Google my business or the Google business

02:21.200 --> 02:26.560
profile or whatever it's called at the time of you seeing this video. Sometimes you'll see an ad

02:26.560 --> 02:31.680
in here. So if there's four companies inside of this, that's because somebody's running an ad.

02:31.680 --> 02:36.400
Okay? So pay attention to that. And what you're going to start doing is start looking for businesses

02:36.400 --> 02:43.200
to add. Now one thing, number one, do not click on people's ads. That pisses me off when people

02:43.200 --> 02:47.760
do it to me. And I'm just really weird about that. Don't click on people's ads. So just because you're

02:47.760 --> 02:53.280
being lazy, don't do that. Okay? So it says, if it says the diamond solutions, what I did is I

02:53.280 --> 02:58.480
literally went and typed in the diamond solutions.com. Okay? And you're just going to start going through

02:58.480 --> 03:04.320
and you're going to start adding businesses to your list here. Okay? So you're going to want to

03:04.320 --> 03:09.760
do the business name, the URL. And again, we're trying to make this easy. Keep in mind the reason

03:09.760 --> 03:13.760
we're building this list is so that when leads start coming in, first of all, to validate,

03:13.760 --> 03:18.720
Hey, there are people paying for ads. Number two, when leads start coming in, we already have a list.

03:18.720 --> 03:24.000
We could just call. So we want to make this as easy as possible. Business name, URL, reason added.

03:24.000 --> 03:31.120
So for example, this would be like Google ads, current position. You could put where they're at

03:31.120 --> 03:38.160
organically. Just kind of some notes, those types of things. We're going to get into a lot of this

03:38.160 --> 03:44.800
stuff. Like for this first bit, okay? All I want you to really focus on is the business name,

03:44.800 --> 03:50.560
the URL, why they were added. Okay? Those are the things. And in a future video, we're going to talk

03:50.560 --> 03:57.200
about their position, their email address, their phone number, their Facebook page, notes, business

03:57.200 --> 04:03.120
owner name, business owner Facebook profile. We're going to get into deep depth there. A little bit

04:03.120 --> 04:07.760
of stocking, a little bit of Facebook stocking, you know what I mean? But for this one, I just want

04:07.760 --> 04:12.800
a list of business names, URLs, reason added. So we're going to go through Google ads. We're going

04:12.800 --> 04:17.200
to go through home advisor. We're going to go through Angie's list, et cetera. Now with Google ads,

04:17.200 --> 04:21.920
I do want to let you guys know that you need to be careful. Because a lot of these people, they look

04:21.920 --> 04:27.040
like, you know, for example, this person, the Diamond Solution, they are paying for ads. But

04:27.040 --> 04:31.840
if you look at it really closely, these guys do not do residential concrete. These guys do

04:31.840 --> 04:37.200
massive parking lots and massive parking lots are usually a referral based thing. So this is not

04:37.200 --> 04:40.800
somebody I'm going to want to put on my list as much as I would like to. Another company that I

04:40.800 --> 04:45.760
found, Gold Family Contractors, when you look at it, you're like, oh, it's whatever, whatever. And

04:45.760 --> 04:50.080
then you start realizing, okay, this is a stock image, free quote. This looks a lot like a,

04:50.080 --> 04:56.800
um, yeah, this looks a lot like a lead generation site. Oh my gosh. Um, you know, even though he's

04:56.800 --> 05:00.240
got a picture of himself, whatever, this is actually a lead generation site. And you've

05:00.240 --> 05:04.800
read down here, it says, tell us about your project. We connect you with trained professionals,

05:04.800 --> 05:08.560
et cetera, et cetera. So this is a lead generation site. So I'm not going to add this one. Okay.

05:08.560 --> 05:12.080
So you're just going to start going through, you're going to add anyone that's paying for

05:12.080 --> 05:16.560
Google ads. It looks like a good option. Okay. And then I want to show you, um, once we get to

05:16.560 --> 05:20.960
the home advisor stuff, what you're going to do is you're going to click on the home advisor.

05:20.960 --> 05:25.920
Again, if they're, if home advisors running an ad, do not click on their ad. I know they suck and

05:25.920 --> 05:30.960
I hate them too, but guys, I just, I'm a big believer in this karma thing. Don't click on

05:30.960 --> 05:34.480
their ad and then people won't click on yours. At least that's how I feel. Okay. So if you want to

05:34.480 --> 05:38.800
find home advisor, you're going to go to that. They're listing in the organic results, which is

05:38.800 --> 05:46.160
really simple. Click on this. Okay. And they're just going to, you're going to start seeing, uh,

05:46.160 --> 05:52.000
people in this. Now, one thing to be really, really careful of is to make sure number one,

05:52.000 --> 05:57.120
it's the right niche. So for example, this darling house is, it says something, lift my house. This

05:57.120 --> 06:02.800
is probably a, it is a peer foundation company. So it's technically kind of concrete. That's not

06:02.800 --> 06:07.280
really a company that, that I'm that interested in because they're running their, their foundation

06:07.280 --> 06:13.120
repair company. Okay. JB construction and maintenance services. Okay. Uh, we found

06:13.120 --> 06:18.000
J and B after a bad experience bait and switch, blah, blah, blah. So this could be somebody

06:18.000 --> 06:21.280
interesting. So for this one, what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and just copy this

06:22.080 --> 06:27.040
and I'm going to open a new window and I'm going to check it out. Okay. I'm not a robot. Looks like

06:27.040 --> 06:30.880
I'm searching a lot. So I think I'm a robot. Okay. J and B construction. This looks like a real

06:30.880 --> 06:37.920
company. Let's go ahead and look at their website though. First. Okay. Okay. These guys, Arizona

06:37.920 --> 06:44.160
based full, full service contractor. Yeah. These guys look like they do a lot more than just

06:44.160 --> 06:48.800
concrete, which is fine. But a lot of times when they're doing more than just concrete,

06:49.440 --> 06:54.000
you are going to have people, they don't, they don't want the concrete. They want,

06:54.000 --> 06:58.400
they want the whole job. So this isn't really someone I'm going to, I'm going to hold on that

06:58.400 --> 07:02.800
one. I'm going to keep looking Arizona foundation solutions. Again, that's the foundation company.

07:02.800 --> 07:09.120
No, thank you. McDowell landscaping. Okay. Perfect. That would be somebody that would be

07:09.120 --> 07:13.680
interesting. They're, they're a landscaping company. So I'll check them out and guys,

07:13.680 --> 07:17.760
take your time. Treat these like these are people you're going to be working with for a while.

07:17.760 --> 07:23.360
Now, one thing to note here, McDowell, look at their, their deal here. If you're wondering like,

07:23.360 --> 07:27.680
Oh, does this company actually cover this area? It does say, you know, McDowell landscaping in

07:27.680 --> 07:32.880
Queen Creek. So it does cover there, but make sure it's in the right area. Again, this also

07:32.880 --> 07:41.440
kind of looks to me, this puts off a little bit of a, of a lead generation vibe. So here's what I

07:41.440 --> 07:45.920
want to tell you guys. Okay. I want you to look for lead generation companies, be aware of them,

07:45.920 --> 08:00.320
but if, when in doubt, pick up the phone and go like this 480-878-9569. Okay. We're going to call

08:00.320 --> 08:15.440
them. Okay. So I have a weird area code. I'm sure that's why I answered. He did say Mike McDowell.

08:15.520 --> 08:20.080
So he's a real company. This looks like a real company to me. I'm seeing a lot of stuff about

08:20.080 --> 08:23.840
Queen Creek. This to me looks like a real company. The only thing I would be hesitant of is making

08:23.840 --> 08:27.120
sure that they actually did concrete. So what I'll probably do is I'll text them and say,

08:30.640 --> 08:37.760
Hey, do you guys do patios and driveways? Okay. And you'll probably call me back,

08:37.760 --> 08:41.280
but I want to make sure. So this is somebody I would add. Okay. And so what I would do here is

08:41.280 --> 08:45.600
I would add it's McDowell landscaping. You got to be a little bit careful because a lot of these

08:45.600 --> 08:49.200
guys, they just want like specific type of jobs, especially in this market. But what I'm going to

08:49.200 --> 08:58.560
do here is I'm going to put, you know, okay, I'm going to put the McDowell McDowell landscaping,

08:58.560 --> 09:03.520
and then I'm going to put home advisor. Boom. Okay. So I'm just making a list. Okay. And again,

09:03.520 --> 09:07.680
we're going to be coming back and also why you're, while you're here, what I would say

09:07.680 --> 09:10.800
is grab the phone number so you don't have to come back. So you're already on the site.

09:11.360 --> 09:14.800
Do grab the phone number. And if you see an email, grab it, don't go searching too hard,

09:15.520 --> 09:18.800
but grab the phone number so you don't have to come back to the website. So there's the phone

09:18.800 --> 09:24.560
number and he said, and also he said Mike McDowell. So I'm just going to write it down

09:24.560 --> 09:29.920
because he said it in his voicemail. So no reason to track that down later. So anyway,

09:29.920 --> 09:33.200
we're just going to start building the list. Again, use your intuition.

09:34.160 --> 09:42.800
Um, look for lead generators, look for people that, um, you know, they're not in your area.

09:42.800 --> 09:46.240
That's one big thing that I've noticed is, and they're going to be in California.

09:46.240 --> 09:52.480
They didn't check the setting that says, you know, to not show them other places. You click

09:52.480 --> 09:57.440
on their thing. They're actually in San Francisco and they're running ads in it in Arizona. It's

09:57.440 --> 10:02.000
ridiculous, but it happens. And then when in doubt, I think the biggest thing I would say is just

10:02.080 --> 10:07.200
when in doubt, just call, just call and ask, say, Hey Mike, this is, uh, this is Nick. Just curious.

10:07.200 --> 10:12.960
Do you guys cover Queen Creek? Okay. Cool. Um, was curious. Do you also do, um, do you do flat

10:12.960 --> 10:16.640
work? Do you do patios and driveways, that kind of thing? Okay. Awesome. Well, I have, you know,

10:16.640 --> 10:19.520
you can say whatever I have client, like you don't need to pitch them right there. In fact,

10:19.520 --> 10:22.400
I would recommend you don't pitch them right there, but you say, okay, sounds good. I'll give

10:22.400 --> 10:25.680
you a call back. Let me talk to my spouse. Something very, very simple. But what I want

10:25.680 --> 10:29.760
you guys to do is I want you to start off and I want you to have, I want you to start building a

10:29.760 --> 10:36.480
list of people and my, as I said in a previous video, get as many people as you possibly can

10:36.480 --> 10:41.600
from Google ads and then go to home advisor and then goes to Angie's list, et cetera, et cetera,

10:41.600 --> 10:46.720
et cetera. And in the next videos, we're going to talk about what happens if you can't find a bunch

10:46.720 --> 10:50.480
of people running Google ads? What happens if you can't find a bunch of people running, um,

10:50.480 --> 10:53.200
advertising on these different platforms? What do you do then?
