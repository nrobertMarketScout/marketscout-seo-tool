Another common question we get is, how long should we wait before you kill or stop a campaign?

00:05.840 --> 00:10.280
So this is assuming that you've set up your ad correctly, that you did the proper due

00:10.280 --> 00:14.040
diligence and you selected the right city and the right niche.

00:14.040 --> 00:17.620
So assuming that those things are correct.

00:17.620 --> 00:23.720
Remember that when we set up an ad campaign, the first two days is a policy review and

00:23.720 --> 00:29.020
then the first five days after that is called a learning, it's in its learning phase.

00:29.020 --> 00:35.220
So the first seven days of a new campaign is never really the best results that you're

00:35.220 --> 00:38.940
wanting to get because Google is learning your ad.

00:38.940 --> 00:44.780
So at a bare minimum, we say at least 14 days because that gives you at least one week of

00:44.780 --> 00:50.080
landing your ads where they should be starting to land and you can start making any tweaks

00:50.080 --> 00:51.340
and stuff like that.

00:51.340 --> 00:57.340
For most of us that do this, we let our ads run from beginning to maybe when we're going

00:57.340 --> 01:03.460
to pull it for three to four weeks after launch date because we like to have two full

01:03.460 --> 01:08.140
weeks of running the ads out of the learning and the policy review phase.
