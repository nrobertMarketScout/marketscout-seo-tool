00:00.000 --> 00:02.640
And my question is about Google Ads.

00:02.640 --> 00:09.600
So how important is it in the process of this process?

00:09.600 --> 00:11.520
Does it start with Google Ads?

00:11.520 --> 00:13.700
Or is there any other way to do it?

00:13.700 --> 00:16.200
Yeah, so it's up to you guys.

00:16.200 --> 00:19.280
I personally prefer using Google Ads

00:19.280 --> 00:21.440
because I like to pre-sell my sites.

00:21.440 --> 00:25.600
I like to go and get that deal upfront.

00:25.600 --> 00:30.040
However, there's the other way to do it,

00:30.040 --> 00:32.480
which is the traditional way.

00:32.480 --> 00:35.640
I'll call it the traditional way, which is where you go,

00:35.640 --> 00:38.000
you pick a city, you pick a niche, you rank the website,

00:38.000 --> 00:40.040
then you go and sell it.

00:40.040 --> 00:43.920
So if you're somebody, let's say you

00:43.920 --> 00:46.120
don't have a lot of capital and you're

00:46.120 --> 00:49.400
nervous to spend money on ads, I still

00:49.400 --> 00:51.400
would argue it's better to go get the deal upfront.

00:51.400 --> 00:53.320
But maybe you're not confident in your ability

00:53.320 --> 00:55.400
to sell it, whatever, and that's what you want to do.

00:55.400 --> 00:56.160
That is fine.

00:56.160 --> 00:58.200
If you want, you could start at the second half

00:58.200 --> 01:00.080
of the training, build a website, rank it,

01:00.080 --> 01:03.800
and then go and start using the first half of the training

01:03.800 --> 01:05.720
to sell the deal.

01:05.720 --> 01:07.200
So you can do it either way.

01:07.200 --> 01:11.040
I just prefer going into it and getting paid

01:11.040 --> 01:12.160
while the website's ranking.

01:15.720 --> 01:19.000
OK, so when you're running Google Ads,

01:19.000 --> 01:24.080
do you do test out three, four sites or properties,

01:24.080 --> 01:27.600
or you just run with one and then see if it is validated,

01:27.600 --> 01:32.160
or you just stop it, or you continue to sell it off?

01:32.160 --> 01:34.960
So how do you start with three, four properties

01:34.960 --> 01:37.000
at the same time?

01:37.000 --> 01:41.600
When you first start, I would recommend starting with one.

01:41.600 --> 01:46.000
But once you get going and you've gotten that first deal,

01:46.000 --> 01:47.360
you can start adding two.

01:47.360 --> 01:48.440
And then once you figure that out,

01:48.440 --> 01:49.520
you can start adding three.

01:49.520 --> 01:52.360
And then what I do is once one website, one ad

01:52.360 --> 01:53.360
starts to really work.

01:53.360 --> 01:54.640
I start to get leads.

01:54.640 --> 01:58.840
Then I pause the other two and I focus on the one and so forth.

01:58.840 --> 02:01.000
So when you first start, you probably

02:01.000 --> 02:04.040
want to start with one.

02:04.040 --> 02:05.440
Got it?

02:05.440 --> 02:06.520
Awesome, Moin.

02:06.520 --> 02:08.400
Let's go get a deal, brother.

02:08.400 --> 02:11.280
One thing I want to remind you of,

02:11.280 --> 02:14.640
make sure that you're focusing on asking people for money.

02:14.640 --> 02:17.240
Because no matter what you do, no matter how much content you

02:17.240 --> 02:19.360
do, no matter how many backlinks you do,

02:19.360 --> 02:21.400
no matter how many websites you look at,

02:21.400 --> 02:23.480
unless you're asking people for money,

02:23.480 --> 02:26.200
you're not going to make money.

02:26.200 --> 02:26.720
Make sense?

02:26.720 --> 02:27.520
Yeah.

02:27.520 --> 02:28.880
Yeah.

02:28.880 --> 02:30.760
Awesome, Moin, thanks for helping out, brother.

02:30.760 --> 02:31.760
We'll talk soon.

02:31.760 --> 02:34.400
And let's go get a deal, dude.
