WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.120
All right, let's do this.

00:03.120 --> 00:04.120
Let's do this call.

00:04.120 --> 00:05.200
Let me hit everyone.

00:05.200 --> 00:09.720
Let's do this and let's rock and roll.

00:09.720 --> 00:10.720
Okay.

00:10.720 --> 00:16.800
So like I said, we've got Michael Steiner, we've got Shelly Xander, we've got Ritu and

00:16.800 --> 00:19.520
everyone else I mentioned before, Stephanie Prather, shout out to Stephanie Prather.

00:19.520 --> 00:26.840
We interviewed her last week on, it was on Thursday night actually, and coming live from

00:26.840 --> 00:33.000
Las Vegas, Nevada, she is at, she just hit $11,900 per month.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.280
So shout out to her.

00:34.280 --> 00:35.920
Pierre, let's get going, bro.

00:35.920 --> 00:37.520
You can hear me still, right?

00:37.520 --> 00:38.520
Yeah.

00:38.520 --> 00:39.520
Okay.

00:39.520 --> 00:40.520
Let's do this thing.

00:40.520 --> 00:43.640
I'm just making sure that I can still see myself and see you.

00:43.640 --> 00:45.520
Ritu says good morning.

00:45.520 --> 00:47.760
So Pierre, we're going to jump right into it yesterday.

00:47.760 --> 00:50.000
We did a little bit of the other stuff.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.080
Maybe I'll just fill everybody in.

00:51.080 --> 00:56.440
So Pierre was somebody who had tried a bunch of different business models.

00:56.440 --> 00:58.400
He was looking for the right one.

00:58.400 --> 01:04.520
He's originally from France and moved to Thailand once, hold on, see how good I am.

01:04.520 --> 01:12.000
You moved there in 2000, the first time in 2018, and then he moved there again in 2023.

01:12.000 --> 01:16.320
But this time he came here and when he moved to Thailand, he's like, dude, I'm doubling

01:16.320 --> 01:20.200
down on rank and rent and I'm going to make this work.

01:20.200 --> 01:24.320
Before you were doing stuff with fitness and all kinds of stuff, making pretty good money,

01:24.320 --> 01:26.160
but you didn't see the scalability.

01:26.160 --> 01:27.840
How close was I on that story?

01:27.840 --> 01:28.840
Decent?

01:28.840 --> 01:29.840
Decent.

01:29.840 --> 01:33.440
I missed some details, but everything I said was correct, right?

01:33.440 --> 01:34.440
I didn't say anything wrong.

01:34.440 --> 01:35.440
I didn't do fitness.

01:35.440 --> 01:36.440
It was business.

01:36.440 --> 01:42.360
I was consulting freelancers to basically find a customer, but sometimes-

01:42.360 --> 01:43.360
Okay.

01:43.360 --> 01:45.760
I thought for some reason, because I remember you told me one time you met Alex Hermosy,

01:45.760 --> 01:48.640
so I always thought you were in the fitness world.

01:48.640 --> 01:54.480
It's my previous business partner that I started the business with, Anthony, that you might

01:54.480 --> 01:55.980
have talked with before.

01:55.980 --> 01:59.260
So yeah, he was quite big in the fitness in France.

01:59.260 --> 02:00.260
Okay, cool.

02:00.260 --> 02:01.260
All right.

02:01.260 --> 02:05.100
Well, dude, I just want to get into this.

02:05.100 --> 02:09.220
So Pierre's at $12,370 per month.

02:09.220 --> 02:15.460
He has one of his deals, he gets paid a flat fee and then he makes commissions on top.

02:15.460 --> 02:19.700
So this month he's probably going to collect between 15 and 20K per month.

02:19.700 --> 02:25.980
But I specifically want to talk about the details of how you've been able to get to

02:25.980 --> 02:26.980
$12,370.

02:26.980 --> 02:30.500
By the way, again, he's also doing this from Thailand.

02:30.500 --> 02:34.720
So any of you that are outside the US that think, oh my gosh, I can't do this because

02:34.720 --> 02:39.740
I don't have an American accent or I'm not from the US, that's a bunch of crap.

02:39.740 --> 02:40.740
That's not true.

02:40.740 --> 02:41.860
It doesn't matter.

02:41.860 --> 02:49.060
One of our other colleagues that's in my group, Mike V, is in Thailand with Pierre.

02:49.060 --> 02:50.060
He's in a different part of Thailand.

02:50.060 --> 02:51.060
Good friends, yeah.

02:51.060 --> 02:52.060
Yeah, but he's crushing it too.

02:52.060 --> 02:57.900
He's at like 40 grand a month and he's actually targeting New Zealand and all of his clients

02:57.900 --> 02:58.900
are in New Zealand.

02:58.900 --> 03:00.020
So let's start there, bro.

03:00.020 --> 03:01.020
Are your clients in France?

03:01.020 --> 03:03.220
Are your clients in US, Thailand?

03:03.220 --> 03:04.220
Where are you targeting?

03:04.220 --> 03:06.980
100% in France right now.

03:06.980 --> 03:07.980
100% French.

03:07.980 --> 03:08.980
Yeah.

03:08.980 --> 03:10.060
That's amazing, dude.

03:10.060 --> 03:14.900
So I'm going to ask you this question because a lot of people when they start talking about

03:14.980 --> 03:19.340
targeting the UK or targeting Australia or targeting somewhere beside the US, you know

03:19.340 --> 03:20.340
what they always say?

03:20.340 --> 03:21.340
Yeah.

03:21.340 --> 03:22.340
It's not going to work.

03:22.340 --> 03:27.620
Well, they say it can work, but they're like business owners don't want to pay very much

03:27.620 --> 03:29.260
and it's hard to convince them.

03:29.260 --> 03:30.540
So tell me about that, dude.

03:30.540 --> 03:31.540
How has that been?

03:31.540 --> 03:35.420
I mean, I've lunch, I think maybe two or three ads in the US.

03:35.420 --> 03:40.180
I had a few leads and I've kind of tried both at the same time and I like it clicked faster

03:41.180 --> 03:47.540
France, but I'm still kind of in between, you know, I might go in the US at some point.

03:47.540 --> 03:51.780
But yeah, I think like it's hard to really judge how it is in the US.

03:51.780 --> 03:57.340
But from what I see, it feels more business friendly, just from the culture and what I

03:57.340 --> 03:58.340
see.

03:58.340 --> 03:59.340
But in France, it's also work.

03:59.340 --> 04:02.900
I would say France is probably harder to get the credit card.

04:02.900 --> 04:05.700
But then people are really, how to say, recurring.

04:05.700 --> 04:08.540
I have almost no children.

04:08.620 --> 04:13.780
I have a guy like his struggle amounts, but overall, like they don't want a child.

04:13.780 --> 04:20.100
And yeah, man, it's like probably harder to get going, but then the trust is very high.

04:20.100 --> 04:21.100
That's amazing.

04:21.100 --> 04:25.140
So he is doing this exactly entirely in France.

04:25.140 --> 04:30.620
So those of you that are in your home country, whether you're in Argentina or whatever the

04:30.620 --> 04:35.900
case is, I'm not saying every country is going to work because, for example, I spent a lot

04:35.900 --> 04:37.380
of time in Sierra Leone.

04:37.420 --> 04:40.860
I can already tell you it's not going to work really well in Sierra Leone because people

04:40.860 --> 04:42.420
don't really search the Internet.

04:42.420 --> 04:45.180
They do a lot of referral stuff.

04:45.180 --> 04:49.900
But there are countries, France, I bet you it would work really well in Belgium.

04:49.900 --> 04:54.620
I bet you it would work well in, of course, in London and Ireland and these different

04:54.620 --> 04:55.620
places.

04:55.620 --> 04:56.900
But so that's interesting.

04:56.900 --> 04:59.660
So let's talk about this.

04:59.660 --> 05:04.240
Before we got on, you told me most of your deals are through pre-selling, through going

05:04.240 --> 05:06.820
and getting the client first.

05:06.820 --> 05:09.620
How has it been running ads in France?

05:09.620 --> 05:16.780
So I started, that's probably one of the few things I've tweaked from your model.

05:16.780 --> 05:19.380
Smart campaign didn't work in France.

05:19.380 --> 05:25.460
So I had to straight go into expert mode and it didn't work so well.

05:25.460 --> 05:30.300
Like actually, my first maybe 12 months was I was launching ads, I had a few leads, I

05:30.300 --> 05:33.700
was closing a deal, then no more leads or like one a week or something.

05:33.700 --> 05:34.700
Then the guy would turn.

05:34.700 --> 05:36.740
Then I would try to improve ads.

05:36.740 --> 05:43.100
Then I would go again to sell and until I figure out how to make enough leads, you know.

05:43.100 --> 05:44.660
So I work on it, work on it.

05:44.660 --> 05:50.620
I was about to stop doing Google ads and go all in in SEO because it was working better.

05:50.620 --> 05:52.420
And Mike really helped me out.

05:52.420 --> 05:58.380
Like honestly, I think it's the best guy I met in this community towards Google ads is

05:58.380 --> 05:59.380
just crushing it.

05:59.380 --> 06:03.820
I don't know if you knew that, but he was doing Google ads like four or five years before

06:03.900 --> 06:08.580
he started, which is why he's super good and exactly in this in Legion.

06:08.580 --> 06:12.700
So then we build up the skills and now we have like dedicated landing page and we kind

06:12.700 --> 06:13.700
of duplicate there.

06:13.700 --> 06:18.540
It's super quick and we have like a list of keywords, negative keywords and everything.

06:18.540 --> 06:23.340
So it's just we are much better at Google ads now and now it's working.

06:23.340 --> 06:26.180
We just launched new ads last week.

06:26.180 --> 06:30.460
There is leads coming in, customers are paying and just speed up everything.

06:30.460 --> 06:35.740
So now we are doing ads all the time, except some smaller sites that are already ranked

06:35.740 --> 06:39.740
and we don't really need to put ads and we just want to keep full profit stuff like that.

06:39.740 --> 06:42.780
But the main strategy is pre-selling for sure.

06:42.780 --> 06:48.180
So for the people on this call that maybe don't know my strategy that I teach or that

06:48.180 --> 06:51.100
I believe in, maybe you can just walk them through.

06:51.100 --> 06:54.380
I know some of the people are going to be like, oh, here we go again because we always

06:54.380 --> 06:55.380
talk about it.

06:55.780 --> 07:00.580
Just in a nutshell, obviously everyone in here knows the regular strategy, right?

07:00.580 --> 07:04.700
Pick a city and niche, rank the website, try to go sell it, right?

07:04.700 --> 07:06.860
Tell everyone what we do with pre-selling.

07:06.860 --> 07:12.180
Yeah, I mean, I think it's not boring, man, because I still work through the whole process

07:12.180 --> 07:16.020
once in a while, like every few months to kind of simplify everything and have everything

07:16.020 --> 07:17.020
in my head.

07:17.020 --> 07:21.820
So I think I did it a couple of times, probably, I don't know, a hundred times now because

07:21.820 --> 07:23.780
I didn't close all the deals.

07:23.780 --> 07:28.740
So it's like, first of all, you do the due diligence, you have a whole part of this in

07:28.740 --> 07:31.940
your program, which I think it's great as well.

07:31.940 --> 07:39.820
Basically, you look for enough volume to get enough leads and not too much competition

07:39.820 --> 07:43.340
so you can rank the site for a good area.

07:43.340 --> 07:44.340
Then you build a prospect list.

07:44.340 --> 07:47.540
Now we have a VA that does this, it's super, super simple.

07:47.540 --> 07:50.380
You get people that do Google Ads.

07:50.380 --> 07:51.380
That's a tweak I made.

07:51.500 --> 07:54.740
So I did a post in an approval with Shiv about that.

07:54.740 --> 07:59.500
Now I SMS people, I don't do call call, I use Shiv strategy.

07:59.500 --> 08:04.540
It's super good, man, honestly, for me, I prefer this because I know how to call call.

08:04.540 --> 08:08.620
I'm not afraid to do it, but it's just, I don't know, it's shitty because you are interrupting

08:08.620 --> 08:09.620
people.

08:09.620 --> 08:11.580
With SMS, they get back to me.

08:11.580 --> 08:17.980
So I SMS like the 10, 15 people that I have in my prospecting list and they either SMS

08:17.980 --> 08:18.980
back.

08:18.980 --> 08:19.980
They're like, who are you?

08:19.980 --> 08:20.980
What do you want?

08:21.580 --> 08:22.580
I can do the job, whatever.

08:22.580 --> 08:23.580
Or they call.

08:23.580 --> 08:28.460
So if they call, I just reply and they call me, you know, so it's switch the frame.

08:28.460 --> 08:29.460
That's cool.

08:29.460 --> 08:33.860
Call calling 100% work is just, I don't know, a bit better for me.

08:33.860 --> 08:35.860
I just prefer it this way.

08:35.860 --> 08:41.820
And then I do your 100% your script, the few questions, like I think there is 10 questions,

08:41.820 --> 08:47.020
like when can you do the quote, when can you do the work, whatever.

08:47.020 --> 08:48.020
I qualify this.

08:48.060 --> 08:52.500
And this, at first, I was quite shy when I started, I was like, I didn't know.

08:52.500 --> 08:58.180
Now I really do this more as an interview, you know, I'm like, okay, man, qualify, why

08:58.180 --> 09:02.380
should I send you my lead, you know, and the frame will switch with experience and doing

09:02.380 --> 09:03.420
it more.

09:03.420 --> 09:07.300
And that makes the deal much easier because the guy is like, yeah, yeah, I have a team,

09:07.300 --> 09:10.700
I can do more business, you know, like, are you sure, man?

09:10.700 --> 09:11.700
Are you working on Saturday?

09:11.700 --> 09:14.700
You know, if I send you a quote tomorrow, can you do it?

09:14.700 --> 09:15.700
Yeah, yeah.

09:16.380 --> 09:21.380
They're trying to sell you, they're trying to sell you though, smart.

09:21.380 --> 09:25.100
And that didn't came straight because I didn't do this industry contractor, they are really

09:25.100 --> 09:29.220
strong frame, like they, I don't know, they are doing heavy stuff all day, so on the phone,

09:29.220 --> 09:32.300
they don't really have time, they don't really care about you, so you really need to understand

09:32.300 --> 09:33.300
how to talk with them.

09:33.300 --> 09:37.420
For me, it took me a month to really figure it out, try again, and I'm still improving

09:37.420 --> 09:38.420
it.

09:38.420 --> 09:44.900
And yeah, after that, I transfer a few leads, with time I transfer less and less and I really

09:44.900 --> 09:52.220
talk, qualify them, qualify them, and then I do the closing call, your script again,

09:52.220 --> 09:56.820
I linked it a bit more with the backend, like now I try to get as many information so then

09:56.820 --> 10:02.020
my team can implement without me doing anything.

10:02.020 --> 10:03.020
That's the main thing.

10:03.020 --> 10:10.900
And then onboarding, usually, I text them a bit, everything's okay, and that's it, man.

10:10.900 --> 10:12.700
So yeah, I love that, dude.

10:12.780 --> 10:17.740
And by the way, I love, this is the thing, guys, is once you have a really good process

10:17.740 --> 10:23.300
that works, you learn it, you do it until you've started to get deals, and then just

10:23.300 --> 10:29.620
like Pyr did, he took my process, he's doing like 90% of it, he did it a few times, then

10:29.620 --> 10:34.820
he realized, hey, I'm gonna make these couple of changes that are, they're not gonna change

10:34.820 --> 10:39.100
the fundamental process, but they're gonna make it a little bit easier, so instead of

10:39.180 --> 10:43.860
cold calling, he's using the text strategy that Shiv's using, everything the same, then

10:43.860 --> 10:48.780
he uses the text strategy, which I love because then they're coming at you, so then the leverage

10:48.780 --> 10:51.100
is with you, right?

10:51.100 --> 10:52.100
So you're not worried about it.

10:52.100 --> 10:55.580
Yeah, so it just completely changes the dynamic.

10:55.580 --> 10:57.500
So guys, yeah, the strategy's really simple.

10:57.500 --> 11:01.420
Instead of waiting for the website to rank, we run ads, right?

11:01.420 --> 11:05.260
You run ads, you run Google ads, and you get leads up front.

11:05.260 --> 11:08.100
You get the leads, you take the leads, you go, you send them to a business owner, you

11:08.100 --> 11:12.420
get them excited, you close the deal, you get the credit card, and then you do everything

11:12.420 --> 11:14.980
that Shiv teaches in this program.

11:14.980 --> 11:19.820
You build the site, you rank the site, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, okay?

11:19.820 --> 11:25.180
One thing I was gonna mention really quick is the reason why I like Google ads.

11:25.180 --> 11:26.660
So I wanna say this.

11:26.660 --> 11:30.900
I actually did a podcast on this yesterday, you guys can check it out on my YouTube channel,

11:30.900 --> 11:37.380
and I put, the title of the podcast was Can You Use Facebook Ads for Rank and Rent, right?

11:37.380 --> 11:39.620
The short answer is yes, you can.

11:39.620 --> 11:42.820
And I want you guys to understand that you can use whatever you want.

11:42.820 --> 11:49.580
The strategy is running paid ads up front to get leads, and sending the leads in advance.

11:49.580 --> 11:50.900
That's the strategy.

11:50.900 --> 11:54.500
The tactic that I use is Google ads.

11:54.500 --> 12:00.340
The reason why I like Google ads over Facebook ads is because there's buyer intent.

12:00.340 --> 12:03.820
That's the biggest, number one biggest reason is there's buyer intent.

12:03.820 --> 12:04.900
What do I mean by that?

12:04.940 --> 12:09.060
If somebody is on Google, they're looking to solve a problem.

12:09.060 --> 12:14.340
Pool deck resurfacing, near me, right?

12:14.340 --> 12:17.460
What are some of the niches you're in, Pierre?

12:17.460 --> 12:24.380
The classic landscaping, concrete, whatever, it's a bit different in France, but honestly,

12:24.380 --> 12:28.260
I was like, if I go to another country, I don't wanna reinvent the niche as well.

12:28.260 --> 12:30.500
I wanna just do the classic one.

12:30.500 --> 12:34.460
I'm probably gonna try some new one, maybe this year, next year, because now we are more

12:34.460 --> 12:40.180
experienced, we have more budget, but at the beginning, I was like, let's just do the basic.

12:40.180 --> 12:41.180
Exactly.

12:41.180 --> 12:49.740
So same thing, concrete, if somebody's on Google and they type in concrete Paris, France,

12:49.740 --> 12:53.580
I know you're not in Paris or from Paris, but concrete Paris, France, they're looking

12:53.580 --> 12:55.500
for concrete, right?

12:55.500 --> 12:58.620
Whereas somebody on Facebook, they're scrolling Facebook, looking at what their friends are

12:58.620 --> 13:02.660
doing and they see a concrete ad, they're not necessarily looking for concrete.

13:02.660 --> 13:06.420
They might schedule an estimate, they might look for pricing, but they're not looking

13:06.420 --> 13:07.420
for concrete.

13:07.420 --> 13:13.780
So if you gave me, if you said you could have 100 Facebook leads or you could have 50 Google

13:13.780 --> 13:16.180
leads, I'll take the Google leads all day, okay?

13:16.180 --> 13:21.220
However, I will tell you that I do know Facebook ads, you can get a lot more for cheaper.

13:21.220 --> 13:25.340
I do know that there's some advantages there, but here's the other reason I like Google

13:25.340 --> 13:30.460
ads, guys, is if you run Google ads in Paris, okay?

13:30.460 --> 13:36.940
I now get to pay Google to put me on page one of Google, so I get to see what would

13:36.940 --> 13:42.180
it be like ranking number one for concrete on Paris without even waiting six months,

13:42.180 --> 13:43.180
right?

13:43.180 --> 13:47.540
If I run Facebook ads, I have no idea what it's like, what kind of leads, how many leads,

13:47.540 --> 13:48.980
I don't have any idea.

13:48.980 --> 13:53.620
You don't get to test the market in the same way you do with Google ads.

13:53.620 --> 13:56.500
But keep in mind, Pierre, you could do anything.

13:56.500 --> 13:57.860
You could do Bing ads.

13:57.860 --> 14:03.560
You could actually, I always joke, you could go and put on your birthday suit and stand

14:03.560 --> 14:08.200
on the corner and twirl a sign that says free concrete estimate.

14:08.200 --> 14:11.380
You can get free leads and use those.

14:11.380 --> 14:14.220
You could get Facebook, you could get leads inside Facebook groups.

14:14.220 --> 14:15.840
You could put up a billboard.

14:15.840 --> 14:17.580
You could go talk to all your neighbors.

14:17.580 --> 14:21.580
It doesn't matter how you get the initial leads, the thing that we do is we send the

14:21.580 --> 14:22.580
leads up front.

14:22.580 --> 14:25.980
By the way, Pierre, do you know what the birthday suit is in English?

14:26.940 --> 14:27.940
No.

14:27.940 --> 14:29.940
Birthday suit means you're naked.

14:29.940 --> 14:30.940
Oh, OK.

14:30.940 --> 14:33.160
So I'm saying, like, it doesn't matter.

14:33.160 --> 14:34.160
You're getting attention.

14:34.160 --> 14:37.180
You take, you go on the corner naked and twirl a sign.

14:37.180 --> 14:39.900
You're probably going to get attention, but you might not get the best leads.

14:39.900 --> 14:42.780
You might get the wrong, you might put up the wrong impression, right?

14:42.780 --> 14:49.060
I would go on an estimate from someone that's naked on a street corner, personally.

14:49.060 --> 14:50.060
You know what I mean?

14:50.060 --> 14:51.060
Some people might.

14:51.060 --> 14:55.540
So depending on the city, you go to that, do that in Vegas, it probably going to work,

14:55.540 --> 14:56.980
it's probably going to work really well.

14:56.980 --> 14:59.300
So I kind of jumped ahead.

14:59.300 --> 15:01.740
So you're just in the basic niches, right?

15:01.740 --> 15:02.740
Yeah, man.

15:02.740 --> 15:08.580
I think, honestly, this business to do what you did, like to make a six-figure year, six-figure

15:08.580 --> 15:13.620
months, I'm not there yet, but I think I can still do the same niche, you know?

15:13.620 --> 15:15.660
Yeah, no, that's my opinion, dude.

15:15.660 --> 15:19.460
It's like, why are we trying to overcomplicate the process?

15:19.460 --> 15:21.660
Like it already, it's proven to work.

15:21.660 --> 15:23.700
So we know concrete works.

15:23.700 --> 15:24.700
Why not use it?

15:24.740 --> 15:28.340
We know that artificial grass works.

15:28.340 --> 15:29.340
Why not use it?

15:29.340 --> 15:33.180
Why are we trying to find these crazy, interesting, at least that's my opinion.

15:33.180 --> 15:35.580
I think there's definitely money in that.

15:35.580 --> 15:43.140
But guys, I spent the first like year, I built websites and carpet cleaning, towing, landscaping.

15:43.140 --> 15:47.140
Dude, I had like 20 different niches and guess what?

15:47.140 --> 15:49.060
None of them were really working well.

15:49.060 --> 15:52.780
And then as soon as I said, I'm just going to go in the boring niches, I started making

15:52.780 --> 15:53.780
a lot of money.

15:54.140 --> 15:55.140
No.

15:55.140 --> 15:56.820
Pierre, I got a couple of questions for you.

15:56.820 --> 16:02.140
And by the way, Pierre, they said they can barely hear you, so I need you to just make

16:02.140 --> 16:03.140
your voice loud.

16:03.140 --> 16:04.140
OK.

16:04.140 --> 16:05.500
There you go.

16:05.500 --> 16:10.620
Luis says, what do you think about hiring someone from Fiverr to get a concrete GMB

16:10.620 --> 16:11.620
verified?

16:13.860 --> 16:15.340
Is it for you or for me?

16:16.340 --> 16:23.740
Well, he's asking for himself, but I think his real question is, would you recommend

16:23.740 --> 16:24.740
doing it?

16:24.740 --> 16:25.740
Would you do it?

16:25.740 --> 16:26.740
I personally would not.

16:26.740 --> 16:33.020
Actually, we're trying right now to find some GMB guys, but we are kind of making a world

16:33.020 --> 16:34.020
hiring process.

16:34.020 --> 16:39.180
So we are, I don't think we did Fiverr, it's Jeremy, my right hand, doing this.

16:39.180 --> 16:43.100
But I think we're trying Upwork, Facebook groups, like all of those guys that know GMB

16:43.100 --> 16:45.100
and actually they have some good techniques.

16:45.100 --> 16:49.620
And the thing is, we just pay if the GMB sticks for 10 days, so you don't really take a risk.

16:49.620 --> 16:53.940
But we are going to try a thousand, maybe hundreds to find a few guys that can open

16:53.940 --> 16:54.940
GMB.

16:54.940 --> 16:58.140
We had someone in France, but the system is not working anymore.

16:58.140 --> 17:02.420
So anyway, I don't think Fiverr is the best place.

17:02.420 --> 17:06.820
I think we have now, I don't know, 90, 100 GMB.

17:06.820 --> 17:10.340
And now all of the Gmail accounts are kind of full of GMB.

17:10.340 --> 17:13.260
Like now we need to kind of have a better process.

17:13.260 --> 17:17.020
So we are looking to build a better process.

17:17.020 --> 17:21.180
But I think if you're kind of on the first side, just do it yourself, do it with your

17:21.180 --> 17:24.060
sister phone or your mom, whatever.

17:24.060 --> 17:25.060
That's the best.

17:25.060 --> 17:27.900
Shiva has a very good strategy for this with the Zoom call.

17:27.900 --> 17:30.860
I don't know if you talk about it in your group.

17:30.860 --> 17:35.580
It's like you do a Zoom call with someone, friends, family, whatever.

17:35.580 --> 17:39.820
That is not so far from where you want to open the GMB and you do like a remote control

17:39.820 --> 17:41.820
on Zoom, which you can do.

17:41.820 --> 17:46.140
Then you can control the other person computer and you can open the GMB with their Gmail

17:46.220 --> 17:51.340
account, which is clean and activate because the main problem is that either your Gmail

17:51.340 --> 17:56.460
open 10 GMBs or Google instantly locks you because they know you are not a concrete guy,

17:56.460 --> 17:58.460
which is going to open one and stop.

17:58.460 --> 18:03.660
And also, if you create a new Gmail, Google is going to be like, OK, this is this is creepy.

18:04.300 --> 18:07.980
It's probably some Indian dudes that is doing this in a row.

18:07.980 --> 18:10.860
So you need a clean Gmail that is used by someone.

18:10.860 --> 18:12.460
So just do it with your friends and family.

18:12.460 --> 18:17.340
All of my friends and family had an open GMB in the first year or first two years.

18:17.980 --> 18:19.020
I love that.

18:19.020 --> 18:22.540
So in short, I don't think Fiverr.

18:22.540 --> 18:23.340
I also agree.

18:23.340 --> 18:24.860
I don't think Fiverr is the best place.

18:24.860 --> 18:30.780
I like to use Fiverr if I need like a logo for five bucks for my GMB.

18:30.780 --> 18:32.220
That's like what I use Fiverr for.

18:32.940 --> 18:33.740
You know what I mean?

18:33.740 --> 18:37.740
By the way, it's called Fiverr, but I don't think I've ever used.

18:37.740 --> 18:41.660
I think I've ever bought anything that was only five dollars, ironically.

18:42.620 --> 18:45.900
It's kind of like there's a store in the US called Dollar General, dude.

18:45.900 --> 18:47.820
And nothing's nothing's a dollar.

18:51.100 --> 18:55.420
OK, real quick, we have Stephanie.

18:56.220 --> 19:02.540
Do companies in France pay for ads or are you are you finding people like

19:04.380 --> 19:07.660
and second part of the question, do they usually pay for Google ads,

19:07.660 --> 19:11.180
Yelp ads or Angie's List or the equivalent?

19:12.060 --> 19:15.980
We don't have Yelp and Angie, but actually they are owned by the same guy,

19:15.980 --> 19:19.340
which is worth five billion in the San Francisco Diary of Dealers,

19:19.340 --> 19:25.900
something that on HomeAdvisor, he also on Expedia, Investopedia, Match.com,

19:25.900 --> 19:29.420
so Tinder, Ingen, 45% of the dating app.

19:29.420 --> 19:33.500
And he on HomeAdvisor and he also on Travel.com,

19:33.500 --> 19:35.100
which is the equivalent in France.

19:35.100 --> 19:38.940
He has in Italy, in Europe, like this guy is the king of Legion.

19:38.940 --> 19:44.220
And so it's not HomeAdvisor, Angie's, but it's similar in France.

19:44.780 --> 19:48.460
And yeah, they pay for all of this, actually.

19:49.260 --> 19:51.420
It's exactly the same as the US.

19:52.380 --> 19:54.780
They're going to pay for this and for us as well.

19:54.780 --> 19:57.100
Sometimes they're going to stop what they did to pay us.

19:57.820 --> 20:02.300
Sometimes they are a better deal to pay Angie's or like equivalent in France.

20:02.300 --> 20:04.220
It's 100% the same.

20:04.300 --> 20:07.980
I had also when I started this kind of fear that,

20:07.980 --> 20:10.540
oh, they already pay for something, they're not going to pay for me,

20:10.540 --> 20:13.260
but I think you're 200% right.

20:13.260 --> 20:16.860
If they already pay for the lead, it's much easier to sell them.

20:17.580 --> 20:17.900
100%.

20:18.780 --> 20:24.620
So yeah, guys, if you guys are calling, I don't care if you're pre-selling

20:24.620 --> 20:26.780
or if you're waiting for your website to rank.

20:26.780 --> 20:30.460
Once you start getting leads, you should be talking to people

20:30.460 --> 20:33.740
who are already paying for advertising, right?

20:34.220 --> 20:37.740
Because they're already sold on advertising.

20:37.740 --> 20:41.020
If I had a gym or I was trying to sell gym memberships,

20:41.020 --> 20:44.700
I would be targeting people who went to the gym already

20:44.700 --> 20:46.220
and then trying to get them to my gym.

20:46.220 --> 20:49.580
I wouldn't be trying to convince people who don't believe in the gym

20:49.580 --> 20:50.620
to come to my gym.

20:50.620 --> 20:53.660
I would go target people who are interested in fitness

20:53.660 --> 20:55.500
and already have that bill.

20:55.500 --> 20:56.380
It just makes sense.

20:56.380 --> 20:58.220
So don't just open up Google.

20:58.780 --> 21:01.740
My very first deal, guys, it was a towing site.

21:02.700 --> 21:05.820
Ironically, I sold that website to Shiv.

21:05.820 --> 21:07.660
That's a totally different story.

21:07.660 --> 21:10.780
But that website, as soon as the first lead came in,

21:10.780 --> 21:11.820
I didn't know what I was doing.

21:11.820 --> 21:15.740
I just went to Google and called the very first person that I could find.

21:15.740 --> 21:19.180
And they didn't believe in paying for advertising.

21:19.180 --> 21:21.580
So make sure you guys are targeting people paying for advertising.

21:22.540 --> 21:27.740
Pierre, what's your biggest challenge in this right now, in this business?

21:27.740 --> 21:32.060
So I have a sales background and I've seen your strategy work really well.

21:32.060 --> 21:35.740
So it makes me save a lot of time or just go faster.

21:36.540 --> 21:42.540
So my problem has kind of always been more the generating more leads, you know.

21:43.180 --> 21:43.740
Okay.

21:43.740 --> 21:46.060
Generating more leads, getting enough volume.

21:47.020 --> 21:47.820
Yeah.

21:47.820 --> 21:48.300
Okay.

21:48.300 --> 21:49.660
Inventory, inventory.

21:50.620 --> 21:51.100
Okay.

21:51.100 --> 21:54.940
Daniel says, how much do you, this is for both of us.

21:55.740 --> 21:57.340
This is for both of us.

21:57.340 --> 21:58.140
You can answer first.

21:58.140 --> 22:00.780
How much do you guys spend on Google Ads per month?

22:01.500 --> 22:03.260
What's your cost per lead?

22:03.260 --> 22:05.420
And how much do you charge the local businesses?

22:05.420 --> 22:08.620
So I'll let you go first and I'll give my answer because you're in France.

22:08.620 --> 22:09.180
I'm in the U.S.

22:10.540 --> 22:13.340
I think we are at 5K a month in ads right now.

22:14.460 --> 22:18.540
But we have some ads that are running and the guys are not paying us yet

22:18.540 --> 22:20.700
because we started the same cycle.

22:20.700 --> 22:22.140
So I would say maybe 12K.

22:22.140 --> 22:23.980
I have maybe 4K of Google Ads.

22:24.940 --> 22:29.420
Also, some guys I could lower it down, but they're referring to business.

22:30.060 --> 22:33.260
They took other sites with me, some kind of supporting them with lead.

22:33.260 --> 22:37.500
So I think we could be around 3K if I wanted to really milk it up.

22:37.500 --> 22:40.220
And once again, SEO is ranking ads are going to go down.

22:40.220 --> 22:45.420
So it's like probably like 30 to 40% for me.

22:45.420 --> 22:46.780
Cost per lead depends on the niche.

22:47.500 --> 22:52.540
I don't think it's really relevant, but in France, like gardening, stuff like that,

22:52.540 --> 22:54.940
it's going to be 20 to 40.

22:54.940 --> 22:56.380
Everything is going to be 100.

22:57.180 --> 22:58.940
But I don't think it's really relevant.

22:58.940 --> 23:01.900
You're just going to see how much you're going to sell them.

23:01.900 --> 23:03.340
And what was the third question?

23:04.540 --> 23:09.340
The second question was, do you know what your cost per lead is or do you track that?

23:11.980 --> 23:14.860
Not clearly, but I just kind of look how much I spend a month,

23:14.860 --> 23:16.940
how many leagues I get, how much I sell it.

23:16.940 --> 23:19.260
Am I making 50% or more?

23:19.340 --> 23:22.940
Yeah, I don't really look either or track it super close.

23:22.940 --> 23:25.580
And then the last question is, what's your average

23:25.580 --> 23:27.580
price that you charge your business owners?

23:28.780 --> 23:33.740
800, but I have some deals that are like 200, some that are like 1,500.

23:34.460 --> 23:39.180
I have some guys that I have like four or five sites with me and they pay me 2,000.

23:39.180 --> 23:40.700
So it's really mixed.

23:40.700 --> 23:43.580
And some it's 200 a month, but it's like organic.

23:43.580 --> 23:46.380
I didn't talk with the guy for the like six, eight months.

23:46.380 --> 23:49.100
I take it, but 2,400 a year.

23:49.100 --> 23:52.060
You put it back in SEO, it's a pretty good return.

23:53.420 --> 23:53.900
Why not?

23:55.180 --> 23:56.940
Yeah, that's really good.

23:56.940 --> 23:58.620
So I'll say real quick.

23:58.620 --> 24:03.180
So Daniel, if we're talking about Google Ads, how much do I spend?

24:03.180 --> 24:04.860
So let me break this down.

24:04.860 --> 24:09.740
To get somebody on the phone to do a Zoom call, I spend between 100

24:09.740 --> 24:14.620
and sometimes up to $400 to get somebody on a Zoom call to close them.

24:14.620 --> 24:17.740
Some of you guys might be thinking that's crazy, but let me tell you.

24:18.700 --> 24:21.500
I make my money back as soon as I close the deal.

24:21.500 --> 24:23.580
Even if I spend $500, right?

24:23.580 --> 24:27.500
You make the $1,000, you say it's $1,000 a month, they pay you the 1,000.

24:27.500 --> 24:29.420
I just made my $400 back.

24:29.420 --> 24:31.580
So guess who actually paid for the ads?

24:32.620 --> 24:34.620
The business owner, not me, right?

24:34.620 --> 24:36.140
So that's the way I look at it.

24:36.140 --> 24:38.460
So that's what it cost me upfront.

24:38.460 --> 24:43.900
And then usually per month, if I do really good at choosing the city and niche,

24:43.900 --> 24:48.060
I only have to spend $10 a day, which is about $300 a month.

24:48.060 --> 24:56.060
But I will go up to $20 a day, up to $600 per month, which some of you guys think is crazy.

24:56.060 --> 24:59.660
By the way, my lowest deals are $1,000 a month typically.

24:59.660 --> 25:03.340
So I'm not going to spend $600 if I'm only making $800.

25:03.340 --> 25:06.540
But if I have a $1,000 deal, I'll spend up to 60%.

25:07.580 --> 25:13.580
And again, what Pierre said, your margins are only going to get bigger, right?

25:13.580 --> 25:17.180
As soon as you get ranking, you're going to be able to lower your ad cost

25:17.180 --> 25:18.940
and you're going to make more money in your pocket.

25:20.700 --> 25:21.200
Makes sense.

25:22.620 --> 25:28.460
So honestly, in my opinion, guys, I think you should have a mix of both.

25:28.460 --> 25:31.660
I think you should have some websites that you're ranking organically.

25:31.660 --> 25:35.660
And there are those really good areas that you found that you're kind of keeping to yourself.

25:35.660 --> 25:39.660
You're adding backlinks, you're adding content, you're doing the rankings little by little,

25:39.660 --> 25:41.660
doing something every day, every week.

25:41.660 --> 25:43.020
I think you should have some of those.

25:43.580 --> 25:49.980
But I think if you guys are not using the strategy of pre-selling with Google Ads,

25:49.980 --> 25:52.300
then I think that you're crazy.

25:52.300 --> 25:58.940
Because you can literally get to the $12,000 mark way faster by doing it.

25:58.940 --> 26:01.340
And you can let other people pay for the ads.

26:01.340 --> 26:02.700
You're not paying for them yourself.

26:02.700 --> 26:03.820
They're paying for the ads.

26:04.860 --> 26:05.420
Makes sense?

26:05.420 --> 26:07.980
And I think also that's important.

26:07.980 --> 26:12.380
But I would say the most important, it gives you trust and confidence in the business.

26:12.380 --> 26:15.820
When you get the strike pumping in, it's very different.

26:16.380 --> 26:19.020
You don't sound the same on the phone, you know?

26:19.020 --> 26:22.860
And there is a huge part about sales.

26:22.860 --> 26:25.980
And sales is like building trust with contractors.

26:25.980 --> 26:28.380
Contractors are getting spammed hardcore.

26:28.380 --> 26:30.300
So you need to build trust with them.

26:30.300 --> 26:34.060
And if you don't trust yourself that there are people paying you every month

26:34.060 --> 26:38.700
and making money with your leads, it's going to be super hard.

26:38.780 --> 26:41.900
For me, it probably happened the same for you, Nick.

26:41.900 --> 26:45.500
But each deal becomes so much faster and faster and easier.

26:45.500 --> 26:47.980
And you're just like, man, you don't take it all good next.

26:47.980 --> 26:50.620
And you call the next guy and you're going again.

26:50.620 --> 26:53.660
And then it's a volume game and you don't really have feelings anymore.

26:54.540 --> 26:54.940
I don't know.

26:54.940 --> 26:55.980
It's so much better.

26:56.940 --> 27:00.380
Once you get the first deal, everything changes, to be honest with you.

27:02.380 --> 27:04.380
OK, here's what I want to do really quick.

27:04.380 --> 27:05.580
I'm going to give away some...

27:05.820 --> 27:10.700
I said yesterday, if people put the word pre-selling on that post,

27:10.700 --> 27:13.180
they would be entered to possibly win some swag.

27:13.820 --> 27:15.100
So here's what I'm going to do.

27:15.100 --> 27:17.260
We've got a couple of comments on here.

27:17.260 --> 27:18.540
Let me go to all comments.

27:21.260 --> 27:22.140
Let's see here.

27:24.300 --> 27:28.380
OK, Shelly Xander said, pre-selling, I'll be on the call tomorrow.

27:28.380 --> 27:31.100
Shelly Xander, if you're live on the call, make a comment, please.

27:31.900 --> 27:34.140
Erwin, are you live?

27:34.140 --> 27:37.180
And Joel Smith, are you live?

27:37.180 --> 27:40.780
By the way, Stephanie Prather, send me a message.

27:40.780 --> 27:42.700
Actually, I'm just going to do it on this call.

27:42.700 --> 27:45.740
You're also a winner because you're at $11,900

27:45.740 --> 27:50.940
and you passed my brother Porter in revenue, which I think is amazing.

27:52.060 --> 27:52.540
Let's see.

27:52.540 --> 27:59.980
So Stephanie, Joel, Erwin, and Shelly, who of you is online right now?

27:59.980 --> 28:00.860
Shelly is live.

28:01.180 --> 28:03.340
Shelly, I'm going to put this right now.

28:03.340 --> 28:07.820
I just need you to go message Ashley De La Rosa.

28:09.020 --> 28:09.660
You'll find her.

28:09.660 --> 28:10.860
She's a friend of mine.

28:10.860 --> 28:14.220
And tell her you won the t-shirt.

28:15.660 --> 28:19.020
She'll send you a promo code and you can just put in the promo code

28:19.020 --> 28:20.780
and it'll send it to your house for free.

28:21.660 --> 28:23.340
So there's Shelly.

28:23.340 --> 28:24.380
Who else is live?

28:24.380 --> 28:26.060
Stephanie, are you still on?

28:26.060 --> 28:27.020
We've got Stephanie.

28:29.420 --> 28:30.540
Stephanie wants her DL hat.

28:30.540 --> 28:33.260
Stephanie, I'm about to place another order of hats.

28:33.260 --> 28:35.260
I don't even think I sell those on the store,

28:35.260 --> 28:38.060
but I'll make sure that as soon as we place an order, I'll get you one.

28:39.020 --> 28:41.900
So you can hold out for that.

28:41.900 --> 28:43.020
Just remind me of that, okay?

28:43.020 --> 28:44.700
Because we've got to get some of those.

28:44.700 --> 28:46.460
And what she's talking about is this hat right here.

28:47.180 --> 28:48.460
The digital landlords hat.

28:49.020 --> 28:50.140
Shelly got it.

28:50.140 --> 28:51.260
Joel's live as well.

28:51.260 --> 28:52.460
Joel, same thing.

28:52.460 --> 28:53.580
Message Ashley.

28:53.580 --> 28:55.180
Tell her you won the t-shirt.

28:55.900 --> 28:56.860
She'll check with me.

28:57.500 --> 28:59.500
I'll see it come through as a notification.

29:00.140 --> 29:01.740
I'll make sure that you actually did that.

29:04.460 --> 29:06.460
Stephanie has the mug, mousepad, t-shirt.

29:06.460 --> 29:09.340
Joel, Shelly, and then there was one more Irwin.

29:09.340 --> 29:11.500
So let's see if Irwin's on as well.

29:11.500 --> 29:13.020
And I'll send it to him.

29:14.220 --> 29:16.140
And then also is Sadie Wilson on?

29:16.140 --> 29:17.580
Sadie Wilson Tangelson.

29:18.860 --> 29:20.300
Sadie, are you on live right now?

29:21.500 --> 29:24.540
And by the way, guys, if you're on right now and you would rather,

29:24.540 --> 29:27.260
we have these mousepads.

29:27.980 --> 29:29.260
We have a coffee mug.

29:29.260 --> 29:30.300
We have AirPods.

29:30.300 --> 29:31.260
We have some other stuff.

29:31.260 --> 29:32.540
You can trade it for that as well.

29:32.540 --> 29:33.500
Don't worry.

29:33.500 --> 29:36.460
So Sadie, if you're on, let me know in the chat.

29:37.500 --> 29:39.420
Pierre, what's your goal by the end of the year?

29:42.220 --> 29:47.900
1.25 per month on December.

29:47.900 --> 29:48.400
10X.

29:49.340 --> 29:50.060
I love that, dude.

29:50.060 --> 29:51.020
Have you been reading that book?

29:52.780 --> 29:55.740
No, but I mean, I read it a while ago, but I get it.

29:55.740 --> 29:57.020
It's quite simple, man.

29:57.020 --> 30:02.140
10X is bigger, easier than 2X because then you kind of think differently than last year.

30:02.940 --> 30:06.780
I mean, to do 2X now, it's so easy because we are already going to make, I don't know,

30:07.740 --> 30:11.500
160, 180 this year without doing anything.

30:12.060 --> 30:14.540
So it's like, just do more, you know?

30:14.540 --> 30:18.700
And if I just do what I did last year, which is like three deals a month,

30:18.700 --> 30:20.300
I'm already at 500K.

30:21.900 --> 30:26.460
So it's when you do the number, actually, I cannot show because we don't have the webcam,

30:26.460 --> 30:30.780
but I have all my numbers here and I can just see what's going on, you know?

30:31.500 --> 30:35.740
For anyone that can't see, which is all of you, he's got a whiteboard right by his desk

30:35.740 --> 30:37.900
and he's got all of his numbers lined out.

30:37.900 --> 30:40.460
I have a notebook I carry with me, same thing.

30:40.460 --> 30:43.820
So Pierre is going to 10X this year.

30:43.820 --> 30:47.820
Guys, I know it sounds crazy when he says 125K per month,

30:47.820 --> 30:50.540
but you have to remember that it's been done, right?

30:50.540 --> 30:51.340
It's been done.

30:51.340 --> 30:51.900
I've done it.

30:51.900 --> 30:56.700
I went from 8,000 to 10,000 per month to 100,000 per month in eight months.

30:57.500 --> 31:01.340
Ryan Dalton, another guy in my group, he's at $100,000 per month.

31:02.460 --> 31:04.220
It's something that's very, very doable.

31:04.220 --> 31:07.740
And the other thing I like, Pierre, is you're doing it in France,

31:09.900 --> 31:11.420
which I think is really interesting.

31:11.420 --> 31:14.060
It makes it kind of completely wide open as well.

31:15.500 --> 31:18.460
Yes or no, because there is less smaller cities.

31:18.460 --> 31:19.900
For me, it's really hard to judge.

31:19.900 --> 31:22.540
Is it better or not to be in France or U.S.?

31:22.540 --> 31:25.260
One very good part about France is since it's smaller,

31:25.260 --> 31:29.500
I have a lot of referral, like 50% of my customers are from word of mouth.

31:30.140 --> 31:35.740
And honestly, I think if I was optimizing for short term,

31:35.740 --> 31:37.580
I would be making more money now,

31:37.580 --> 31:40.860
but I really take care of my customers, oversell them.

31:40.860 --> 31:44.460
As you can see behind me, this is all quotes that my customers sign.

31:44.460 --> 31:46.940
We still have much more to put.

31:46.940 --> 31:49.420
And I really care about my customers making money.

31:50.540 --> 31:55.580
And that pays because then they pay more because they get more leads,

31:55.580 --> 31:57.820
they want more sites, they bring their friends.

31:57.820 --> 31:59.580
So that's part of the strategy.

31:59.580 --> 32:01.900
That's why I think we can scale well this year.

32:01.900 --> 32:06.460
And that's why I really focus more on the inventory and the team

32:06.460 --> 32:09.500
to make sure we have enough leads because I know on the sales part,

32:09.500 --> 32:10.300
I'm not really worried.

32:10.300 --> 32:13.660
It's more about will I get enough leads when I build enough website,

32:13.660 --> 32:16.540
GMB ads and stuff so we get enough leads.

32:17.740 --> 32:18.300
I love that.

32:19.900 --> 32:20.400
Okay.

32:21.260 --> 32:25.100
Stephanie said, and by the way, real quick before I go on,

32:25.100 --> 32:26.300
so just to clarify, Pierre,

32:26.300 --> 32:28.700
you have all your customer testimonials on your wall.

32:29.980 --> 32:33.180
It's not testimonials, it's quotes that they sign.

32:33.180 --> 32:39.660
So if I look at them, it's like, this is one shop in Lyon in France.

32:39.660 --> 32:41.660
It's like 5,000 euros.

32:41.660 --> 32:44.380
And this is some tree service for 8,000 euros.

32:44.380 --> 32:48.780
And like I just, when I'm on the closing call with a customer

32:48.860 --> 32:50.860
and like, oh, I don't know if it's going to work for me.

32:50.860 --> 32:55.340
I do like, I mean, bro, like it worked for all of those guys.

32:55.340 --> 32:56.140
Why not for you?

32:56.140 --> 32:56.460
You know?

32:56.460 --> 32:56.940
I like that.

32:56.940 --> 32:57.660
I like that a lot.

32:57.660 --> 32:58.380
That's interesting.

32:58.380 --> 32:58.780
That's cool.

32:59.340 --> 32:59.740
That's cool.

32:59.740 --> 33:01.740
I saw it on Hormuzi.

33:01.740 --> 33:05.420
He had this in his gym with all of the weight loss transformation before and after.

33:05.420 --> 33:07.100
And I was like, what is it in our industry?

33:07.100 --> 33:08.460
You know, and it's quote, man.

33:09.260 --> 33:10.060
I like that a lot.

33:10.060 --> 33:10.540
That's cool.

33:11.180 --> 33:11.660
Okay, cool.

33:11.660 --> 33:12.620
I've never even thought about that.

33:12.620 --> 33:13.180
It's a good idea.

33:13.820 --> 33:16.540
Stephanie says a year ago, I was selling credit card services,

33:16.540 --> 33:18.060
no money, very hard to sell.

33:18.060 --> 33:19.260
I was selling plasma.

33:20.140 --> 33:21.100
Yeah, that's crazy.

33:21.100 --> 33:21.900
That was a year ago.

33:21.900 --> 33:23.500
Now she's now a year later.

33:23.500 --> 33:24.940
She's at $12,000 a month.

33:25.500 --> 33:27.580
She started rank and rent.

33:27.580 --> 33:32.300
April 1st, 2024 in Shiv's group studied for two months.

33:32.300 --> 33:34.220
I feel like there's another part of the story that's coming.

33:35.100 --> 33:35.580
Is that?

33:35.580 --> 33:35.820
Yeah.

33:35.820 --> 33:41.740
So she started guys, April 1st, 2024 is when she officially started.

33:41.740 --> 33:44.700
Hasn't even been a year in Shiv's group.

33:44.700 --> 33:49.340
And then she joined into digital landlords in July.

33:49.340 --> 33:51.020
I think it was like the last day of June.

33:51.020 --> 33:55.820
So in, let's see, July, August, September, October, November, December,

33:55.820 --> 34:00.780
in seven months, she's got to $12,000 a month, $11,900.

34:00.780 --> 34:06.140
So guys, to kind of wrap this up, I think a good business in this business,

34:06.140 --> 34:07.740
this is the best business model on the internet,

34:07.740 --> 34:10.540
but I think a healthy business should have some ranked,

34:10.540 --> 34:11.980
some organically ranked sites.

34:12.060 --> 34:15.180
You should be running some paid advertising to get deals up front

34:15.180 --> 34:17.100
and you should be going all out.

34:17.100 --> 34:18.540
You should be doubling down on this business.

34:19.420 --> 34:22.060
By the way, Stephanie said her first deal that she got.

34:22.060 --> 34:23.500
So by the way, it took her a minute.

34:23.500 --> 34:25.180
Her first deal she got was November.

34:25.180 --> 34:27.740
So it took her July, August, September, October,

34:27.740 --> 34:31.260
took her four or five months to get her first deal doing this strategy.

34:31.260 --> 34:32.860
And now she's absolutely crushing it.

34:32.860 --> 34:35.980
So guys, appreciate you hopping on the call.

34:35.980 --> 34:38.620
I'm going to drop something if you guys want to check it out.

34:38.620 --> 34:39.500
No pressure at all.

34:39.500 --> 34:41.340
I have two resources for you.

34:41.340 --> 34:44.060
I'll give you one resource and then one other thing.

34:44.060 --> 34:47.980
But if you guys go to rentsimplesites.com,

34:48.780 --> 34:52.620
you guys can learn more about the pre-selling strategy that we actually offer

34:54.140 --> 34:54.860
and that we teach.

34:55.980 --> 34:59.100
It's a quick, it's like seven videos, five minutes long.

34:59.100 --> 35:01.260
You can buzz through it in 30, 40 minutes.

35:01.260 --> 35:04.620
That'll give you a better idea of the overall strategy that we use.

35:04.620 --> 35:08.380
And there's a bunch of people that are in this program

35:08.380 --> 35:11.260
that I also work with inside of Digital Landlords.

35:11.260 --> 35:13.500
So if you see that that's something interesting,

35:13.500 --> 35:16.940
you can follow the steps there and find an application and see if it's a good fit.

35:16.940 --> 35:18.860
But anyway, Pierre, thanks for joining, bro.

35:18.860 --> 35:20.220
When am I going to see you back in Dubai?

35:20.220 --> 35:21.820
When are we going to hang out in Dubai again, dude?

35:23.020 --> 35:28.140
Just before that, highly recommend going on the course, guys.

35:28.140 --> 35:31.740
It was super high return on investment for me.

35:31.740 --> 35:36.700
And I knew how to sell, but it still makes my life so much easier.

35:36.700 --> 35:39.260
I don't know if I would have quit because I was committed,

35:39.260 --> 35:45.260
but it made it, I don't know, smooth enough so that I would step by step stack win.

35:45.260 --> 35:47.260
And now it's so enjoyable to do this.

35:48.060 --> 35:52.540
It's, I don't know, just a super great system and sales recipe.

35:52.540 --> 35:54.300
So I highly recommend it.

35:54.300 --> 35:55.100
I appreciate that.

35:55.900 --> 35:58.540
We just had somebody, this kid that I, I'll say this to end.

35:59.980 --> 36:06.380
I just had this kid that I grew, I went to school with this kid back 10, 15 years ago, right?

36:06.380 --> 36:07.420
Went to high school with him.

36:08.140 --> 36:09.740
He's been watching my posts.

36:09.740 --> 36:11.020
He's been, he's whatever.

36:11.020 --> 36:14.460
He saw my brother that, yeah.

36:14.460 --> 36:17.180
So, so he just joined, his name's Dakota.

36:17.820 --> 36:20.460
And he had a tree, he actually, instead of doing this,

36:20.460 --> 36:22.860
he came out of high school, didn't go to college.

36:22.860 --> 36:24.300
He started of all things.

36:24.300 --> 36:25.340
Guess what he started?

36:25.340 --> 36:27.500
A tree service company, right?

36:28.140 --> 36:31.260
I even tried to sell this guy leads when I first started this.

36:31.260 --> 36:32.780
He didn't want it, whatever.

36:32.780 --> 36:34.380
So he messages me last Friday.

36:34.380 --> 36:37.740
He's like, dude, I'm going to have to get a back operation.

36:37.740 --> 36:40.060
He's like, I might not be able to do tree service.

36:40.060 --> 36:41.660
I should have done this two years ago.

36:41.660 --> 36:43.420
I should have started generating leads.

36:43.420 --> 36:47.260
Anyway, he jumps on the call with us and you know what we asked him?

36:47.260 --> 36:50.220
I always ask people this when they jump on the call to get into my program.

36:50.220 --> 36:52.380
I always ask them, I say, why don't you just do this on your own?

36:53.100 --> 36:54.380
You know, I send it back on them.

36:54.380 --> 36:54.620
Do this.

36:54.620 --> 36:55.660
Why don't you just do it on your own?

36:55.660 --> 36:58.300
And I think that's a good question to ask your business owners, guys.

36:58.300 --> 36:59.580
Why don't you do this on your own?

36:59.580 --> 37:02.540
Because they're going to sell themselves on why they should work with you, right?

37:03.420 --> 37:05.660
So I asked him this question, you know what he said?

37:06.300 --> 37:13.020
He said, if somebody would have told me two years ago to buy a pole saw,

37:13.020 --> 37:17.660
a pole saw is the thing with the pole that has the saw on the end that like extends out.

37:18.380 --> 37:21.980
He's like, if somebody would have told me two years ago to buy a pole saw,

37:21.980 --> 37:25.340
I would have made literally over a hundred thousand dollars.

37:25.340 --> 37:26.380
I just didn't know.

37:27.580 --> 37:30.060
So he's like, he's like, I'm not doing that again.

37:30.060 --> 37:33.340
I'm going to go in and learn from people that are already making the money I want to make

37:33.340 --> 37:36.620
and have them tell me the things to do and not to do.

37:36.620 --> 37:39.820
Because I've already tried to do this on my own in my own business.

37:39.820 --> 37:42.860
And I lost, I missed out on a bunch of money.

37:42.860 --> 37:45.740
So guys, sometimes that's why you guys are in here with Shiv.

37:45.740 --> 37:50.300
And that's the reason I'm in here with Shiv is there's things that he's figured out

37:50.860 --> 37:55.820
that he can teach you in five minutes or in an hour on a video that's going to make you

37:55.820 --> 37:59.900
a hundred thousand dollars or is going to save you a hundred thousand dollars.

37:59.900 --> 38:03.020
So quit trying to do stuff on your own and quit trying to reinvent the wheel.

38:03.020 --> 38:05.580
That's my only advice, but anything you want to add?

38:06.860 --> 38:07.740
Yeah, man.

38:07.740 --> 38:10.780
Talking about Shiv, Shiv is like crazy genius, man.

38:10.780 --> 38:17.500
He was making online money at 13 or 16 or he never talked about this because he's like super humble

38:17.500 --> 38:23.660
and he just focused on helping a student and people in the group, but he's super smart.

38:23.660 --> 38:28.620
And we live in a crazy era where he has this scalability of helping multiple people at the

38:28.620 --> 38:30.540
same time so we can have access to him.

38:30.540 --> 38:32.460
But I think overall, he would just not care.

38:32.460 --> 38:35.820
You know, he would be at other business level, same as you, man.

38:35.820 --> 38:40.460
Like, I think you are one of the guys that had the craziest sales experience door to door.

38:40.460 --> 38:43.820
You cannot transform it online, which makes you super unique.

38:43.820 --> 38:47.260
I mean, for me, I'm super bullish on investing in yourself.

38:47.260 --> 38:51.100
And that's always where I make my best return on investment.

38:51.820 --> 38:52.380
For sure.

38:52.380 --> 38:53.580
I 100% agree with that.

38:53.580 --> 38:56.220
So, well, dude, Pierre, thanks for jumping on, guys.

38:56.220 --> 38:57.180
We apologize.

38:57.180 --> 38:59.740
You couldn't see, you couldn't see here.

39:01.260 --> 39:02.220
For another time.

39:02.220 --> 39:03.820
We'll keep the mystery, man.

39:03.820 --> 39:06.060
Yeah, no, everyone's like, who's this Pierre guy?

39:06.060 --> 39:07.100
Maybe it's just AI.

39:07.900 --> 39:09.180
He isn't a real person, guys.

39:09.980 --> 39:11.820
That's the new AI voice.

39:11.820 --> 39:13.100
Yeah, exactly.

39:13.100 --> 39:17.580
If you guys are on this call right now and you want the actual replay of this,

39:17.580 --> 39:20.300
where you can see both of us and you can see Pierre,

39:20.300 --> 39:22.060
we're going to let the mystery out of the box.

39:22.060 --> 39:24.300
Send me a message on Facebook.

39:24.380 --> 39:27.740
I'll upload this to Vimeo and I'll send you guys a link.

39:27.740 --> 39:29.020
So, Pierre, thanks for jumping on, bro.

39:29.020 --> 39:31.740
Hopefully, I'll see you in Dubai or I'll come to Thailand.

39:33.740 --> 39:35.660
We'll send it again on a Tuesday, you know?

39:38.060 --> 39:39.900
We need to talk still anyway.

39:39.900 --> 39:42.380
Anyway, we'll see you guys next week.

39:43.020 --> 39:43.980
Thanks, bro.
