00:00.000 --> 00:05.040
Tell just take one of those three that you haven't closed and what was one of the objections as to

00:05.040 --> 00:12.160
why they didn't do the deal? Okay so I went to a close with the guy and I told him the price

00:12.160 --> 00:20.000
and I priced out 1500 bucks a month and from right then and there he just had told me that

00:20.000 --> 00:26.800
he was too far out like he was he couldn't do business so right there it was my fault because

00:26.800 --> 00:32.160
I asked him I was like how when could you get an estimate he told me tomorrow like the next

00:32.160 --> 00:37.040
whatever that week and I was like okay I didn't bother to ask him work-wise he was three months

00:37.040 --> 00:43.680
out so that was that was my fault right there I so I should have dug deeper and done a little

00:43.680 --> 00:48.240
better and I think the pricing was a little too high so the guy basically kind of shuttered that

00:48.240 --> 00:54.800
price right yeah that's what it kind of seemed like like it was either yeah that's the price

00:54.880 --> 01:00.400
was just too high as he might like I should have put it lower and he just buckled as soon as I

01:00.400 --> 01:04.800
set 1500 bucks a month so here's the deal and this is a good point and we were talking about

01:04.800 --> 01:10.720
this a couple hours ago when I was in dylan but guys a lot of times they the the business owners

01:10.720 --> 01:15.200
sometimes not a lot of times but sometimes they don't tell you their actual objection

01:15.200 --> 01:22.080
right so what did this guy do he he dylan dropped price and he shit his pants and instead of saying

01:22.080 --> 01:27.920
oh that's too expensive what did he do he said oh I'm too busy right not to mention he's paying

01:27.920 --> 01:33.200
for was it home advisor yeah he's paying for home advice okay paying for home advisor hasn't ever

01:33.200 --> 01:37.680
said a damn word about being too busy he's not allergic to money so he's lying through his teeth

01:37.680 --> 01:41.360
the real reason isn't because he's backed out bro the real reason is because you fucking scared him

01:41.360 --> 01:46.560
with price which I love because you're pricing correctly but here's the deal the the only way

01:46.560 --> 01:51.280
that you're going to overcome that because it should sting that's that's fine okay the only

01:51.280 --> 01:55.440
thing I would say is the way you're going to make that not happen in the future is on your pre-closed

01:55.440 --> 02:01.840
screencast you need to make sure to emphasize how much value they're going to be getting from

02:01.840 --> 02:07.760
these leads without overselling it right so you're on the calculator you're going to show them hey

02:07.760 --> 02:15.440
like dude look man at five thousand dollars and 30 or let's see 15 leads and 30 profit 30 percent

02:15.440 --> 02:22.800
close you're going to make six thousand dollars of profit twenty thousand dollars of net of gross

02:22.800 --> 02:29.600
revenue like that's insane that's from 15 and like what if I get you 30 so the key is dude you just

02:29.600 --> 02:35.680
need to build more value on when you're doing the screencast so that when you get on you're just

02:35.680 --> 02:40.080
going to like you almost need to get them thinking like dude he's going to charge me three grand or

02:40.080 --> 02:44.880
some shit like that yeah right and so one thing you could even drop in dude is you could say you

02:44.880 --> 02:49.200
know how it says six thousand in the bottom right hand corner when you put the stuff in right you

02:49.200 --> 02:54.080
could say something like this you could go what we typically like to do is we like we like to look

02:54.080 --> 02:59.680
at the worst case scenario and we want to make sure we at least double your money right so we want

02:59.680 --> 03:03.440
to make sure so then if he starts doing the math he's like fuck dude he might charge me three grand

03:03.440 --> 03:09.280
a month right because six thousand divided by two so just little things like that but the only way

03:09.360 --> 03:16.320
is you need to build more value I believe on the screencast with the price calculator but also

03:16.320 --> 03:20.240
I think and that comes with me and you communicating is you probably didn't show

03:20.240 --> 03:23.920
enough social proof with some of these other clients that have landed big jobs

03:23.920 --> 03:28.560
and we have a lot of clients that are making a lot of money but anyway that's how I would handle that
