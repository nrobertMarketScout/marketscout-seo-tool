Does Google have an issue with the same credit card being used inside multiple accounts?
Not that I'm aware of. Like I said, I have probably four or five right now that I'm running
and it's the same PayPal and the same Amex and no issues, but it doesn't mean I'm not going to
tonight or tomorrow. That's just whatever. And we'll figure it out. We'll figure it out.
So if it happens, whatever.
