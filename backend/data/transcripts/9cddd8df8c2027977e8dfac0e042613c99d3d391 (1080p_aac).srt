1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,200
Thinking like Uncle G aka Google. As I've said before in a previous video, the more that

2
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:18,800
we can put ourselves in Google's shoes, the more we can understand what benefits them

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:25,360
and what they're trying to accomplish, the better job we can do at SEO. So I want to

4
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,760
have you guys just think about something really quick and maybe it's something you've asked

5
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,240
yourself before. Maybe it's not. But I want you to ask yourself this question. It's a

6
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:38,120
rhetorical question. How does Google actually make money? We see them all over. We know

7
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:42,320
they're worth billions and billions of dollars. They might even be worth a trillion at this

8
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,760
point. I don't even know. They make phones. I mean, it's such a big company. It's such

9
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,600
a popular thing that it's a verb now. Like, did you Google it? It's actually a verb. But

10
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,840
how do they make money? What is their main revenue source? Well, I'm going to give you

11
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,000
the answer, and that is through this little thing called AdWords, which all of us are

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,120
familiar with because we've all dealt with it. We've all spent money on it. We've all

13
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:14,280
used it and abused it, et cetera. And so the reason I'm bringing that up is you then need

14
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,760
to ask yourself, okay, well, how does AdWords work? Why does AdWords work? Well, AdWords

15
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:26,280
works because so many people go to Google. They have so many searches that they can charge

16
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:32,600
for it. Well, why do they have so many searches? Okay, we're just going down the rabbit hole,

17
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,200
but think about it. If you have a question, if you're looking for concrete, if you're

18
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,080
looking to extend your pool deck or you're looking to put in a sidewalk or you're looking

19
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:45,080
to pour a pad for your basketball hoop for your kid or whatever, right, what are you

20
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:49,880
going to do? You're going to go to Google and you're going to search concrete contractors

21
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:54,360
near me or concrete contractors Las Vegas, Nevada or concrete contractors St. George,

22
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:03,840
right? Why? Because in the past, every time you've searched anything, Google has given

23
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,640
you results that are very, very accurate and they almost know exactly what you're looking

24
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:14,800
for. And we have gotten so accustomed to, if we have a question, we don't even need

25
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:20,640
to really type it in correctly. We can honestly just type in a part of a lyric or somebody's

26
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:26,200
name that's spelled incorrectly or somebody is famous plus their husband and it will pull

27
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:33,200
it up. Their search engine is so good and is so accurate that we have relied on Google

28
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:40,360
to answer all of our questions. But for Google to keep charging exorbitant amounts of money

29
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:46,680
like they do for AdWords, that has to stay true. What does all this mean, Nick? What

30
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:53,680
this means is Google needs us as customers to trust them. And so they need to put the

31
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:59,160
top, the people that they put at the top of Google in the maps, in the organic and even

32
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:06,160
in the ads, they have to be relevant to what people are looking for, aka they need to get

33
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:12,040
their questions answered. Okay? So what I just need you to wrap your head around is

34
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:17,000
as you're doing SEO, as you're doing content, as you're doing your ads, as you're doing

35
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,480
everything related to Google, keep in mind how Google makes money. And think about it

36
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:28,000
as you go to put something on your website, ask yourself is this related to somebody that's

37
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,280
searching for concrete contractors? Would they also search this thing? Somebody that's searching

38
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:40,280
concrete contractors is probably also searching for how much does concrete cost? Can you pour

39
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:47,640
concrete in the cold? Top rated concrete contractors near me, concrete company, right? And there's

40
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,960
all these different things that are related to it. So let's use another example, right?

41
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,840
People that are searching for Kanye West, and I'm using him because right now he's getting

42
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:04,560
blown up in the media, so it's on top of everybody's minds, okay? If you're, somebody or you that's

43
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,280
searching for Kanye West is also probably searching for other things, right? They might

44
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,680
be searching for Kanye's net worth. They might be searching for Yeezy's. They might be searching

45
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:21,680
for Kim, right? They might be searching for some crazy comment that he made. And so the

46
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,440
companies that understand this, the companies that write the blog articles and the regular

47
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:34,440
articles and the pages that talk about all of those things that are the most authoritative

48
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:38,960
around that subject matter are the ones that are going to win. So when we're doing sites

49
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,960
and we're doing content and we're doing our on page SEO, which we're going to get into

50
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:48,360
all that, I just need your frame of mind realizing that we need to be the most authoritative.

51
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,120
We need to be all encompassing. If we're talking about concrete contractors, we also need to

52
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,040
be talking about concrete companies. We also need to be talking about concrete cost. That's

53
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:00,440
why we do the keyword list so thoroughly. And there are some things we don't care about

54
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:04,460
ranking for, right? We don't care about cheap concrete near me because those are not customers

55
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:10,060
that we want. But I just want you guys, as you're going through this, if you can drill

56
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:14,440
this into your head and every time you're about to put something on your page or choose

57
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:18,400
an anchor text, which all these terms I'm going to get into. If you don't know what

58
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:24,060
somebody is talking about, it's coming. But I'm just giving you a little precursor. Just

59
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:30,660
think like Google. Think like Uncle G and for them to continue to charge for ads, which

60
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:35,660
is their main revenue stream, they have to continue to be trusted. And the way that they

61
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:41,660
are trusted is because when you search something, they put results at the top that answer your

62
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:48,660
questions.
