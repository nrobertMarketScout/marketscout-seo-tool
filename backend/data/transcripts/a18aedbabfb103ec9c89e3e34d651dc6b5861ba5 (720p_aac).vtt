00:00.000 --> 00:05.600
rewatch module one and you're going to have to learn that this is, it's honestly more of like a

00:05.600 --> 00:09.920
gut feeling. There's not going to be specific things they're necessarily going to say. Sometimes

00:09.920 --> 00:15.440
there will be, sometimes they'll say something, but most of the time it's what they're not saying

00:15.440 --> 00:20.480
or they're just being too agreeable. Like I remember somebody posted a video in here of them

00:20.480 --> 00:27.520
doing a hook, right? And the person just kept saying, yeah, that sounds good. Yeah. Okay. Cool.

00:27.760 --> 00:32.400
Sounds good. And it was like, they just kept saying yes, because it was easier than saying no.

00:33.120 --> 00:37.200
So it's more Nick, when you're listening to this, go watch module one, rewatch it.

00:38.320 --> 00:45.520
I'm sorry, not module one, module four, go watch, go rewatch module four and, and do that. But the

00:45.520 --> 00:51.440
other thing is I'll guarantee that this could solve 99% of your problems. Nick is just start making it

00:51.440 --> 00:55.440
a habit. When you get to the end of that call and they sound interested and they keep going along

00:55.440 --> 01:02.160
with you, do this, do the pullback. Hey, look, man, just want to double check, like happy to send

01:02.160 --> 01:06.320
you a lead or two for free, but if that's all you're looking for, I'll still send it to you,

01:06.320 --> 01:10.640
but I just want to be candid with you. I am looking to partner with somebody. So I just

01:10.640 --> 01:14.080
want to make sure we're going to be good to talk in a couple of days. Is that cool? And if they,

01:14.080 --> 01:18.000
if at that point you're giving them an out and if they're like, well, actually I'm actually pretty

01:18.000 --> 01:24.800
busy, like, like double commit them, pull back. Like I don't care if you don't want to talk,

01:24.800 --> 01:29.840
just tell me I'm a big boy. I'm a big girl. I don't need you to just, you know, kiss my

01:29.840 --> 01:35.600
ass. Tell me the truth. So that, I think Nick, the real question here, I know what you're dealing

01:35.600 --> 01:41.200
with. Start doing the pullback every single time and you're going to start, you're going to start

01:41.200 --> 01:46.480
getting the not serious people out. And maybe these people, some of these are serious, but just

01:46.480 --> 01:52.720
because of the, you're acting timid to ask that question. Um, they're, they're just going along

01:52.720 --> 01:56.880
with you and then they're, they're kind of pushing them away. So try that. I think that

01:56.880 --> 01:58.080
will solve a lot of your problems.
