00:00.000 --> 00:12.940
So how do you know how many samples to send?

00:12.940 --> 00:14.400
How many leads do you send?

00:14.400 --> 00:16.200
Is there a specific number?

00:16.200 --> 00:19.060
Is there a specific timeframe?

00:19.060 --> 00:21.980
And honestly, the answer is probably going to piss you off a little bit because there

00:21.980 --> 00:26.600
is no set number of leads, there is no set timeframe, okay?

00:26.600 --> 00:28.560
Because it's different for every person.

00:28.560 --> 00:33.600
So only thing I want to mention on this is there's no set anything, okay?

00:33.600 --> 00:39.440
I've had customers where I have sent three leads over the course of two weeks and somehow

00:39.440 --> 00:40.440
I sold the deal.

00:40.440 --> 00:43.880
I've had customers where I sent five leads in one day and I sold the deal.

00:43.880 --> 00:48.720
I've had customers where I've sent one lead in half a day and I've sold the deal.

00:48.720 --> 00:52.060
Every customer is different because every customer is at a different stage.

00:52.060 --> 00:53.600
Every lead that you send is different.

00:53.600 --> 00:56.560
And so all I want to mention on this, because this is a question I get frequently, is how

00:56.560 --> 00:57.720
many should I send?

00:57.880 --> 01:04.600
I have a couple of rules of thumb, but more than anything, above and honestly, the rules

01:04.600 --> 01:08.440
of thumb are great, but this takes precedence, is it's a feeling.

01:08.440 --> 01:09.440
And you're going to know.

01:09.440 --> 01:11.320
And the more that you do this, the more you're going to know.

01:11.320 --> 01:15.280
They're going to start asking questions and there's going to be this moment in time where

01:15.280 --> 01:18.500
the iron is hot and you need to strike.

01:18.500 --> 01:20.360
And sometimes it's not convenient.

01:20.360 --> 01:24.320
Sometimes you are going on vacation tomorrow and they're ready to talk and you need to

01:24.320 --> 01:26.480
stay up late and you need to do that call tonight.

01:26.480 --> 01:29.760
Or you need to get up at 3 a.m. and you need to do that call before you go on vacation.

01:29.760 --> 01:31.020
And I know it's not convenient.

01:31.020 --> 01:35.740
And I know you'd rather do it after the vacation or on your time, but when the iron is hot,

01:35.740 --> 01:36.880
you got to strike.

01:36.880 --> 01:40.040
You have to strike because that is your opportunity, okay?

01:40.040 --> 01:45.020
And it is a feeling and we're going to get more into this, but I'm telling you that you

01:45.020 --> 01:46.020
just have to feel it.

01:46.020 --> 01:47.640
Their customer is going to be ready.

01:47.640 --> 01:48.640
You're going to know it.

01:48.640 --> 01:49.720
They're going to start asking questions.

01:49.720 --> 01:51.400
They're going to say, hey, when do you want to talk?

01:51.400 --> 01:52.900
Hey, how does this work?

01:52.900 --> 01:56.060
They're going to just put off certain vibes that are going to let you know.

01:56.060 --> 01:57.660
And that is going to be something you're going to learn.

01:57.660 --> 02:02.100
It's something that you have to do rep, rep after rep after rep to learn.

02:02.100 --> 02:04.680
But I do want to share my two rules of thumb.

02:04.680 --> 02:08.200
Outside of that, my rule of thumb is I never try to send more than five leads.

02:08.200 --> 02:10.320
So usually my rule is this.

02:10.320 --> 02:14.880
I send between three to five leads or when they close a deal.

02:14.880 --> 02:17.560
So if I send one lead and they close a deal, I'm getting on the phone.

02:17.560 --> 02:20.060
I don't care if it's the first day and they go and close it right on spot.

02:20.140 --> 02:22.860
If it's the first day I do a duck cleaning lead, they close it over the phone.

02:22.860 --> 02:25.780
I am doing a deal the second they close the lead.

02:25.780 --> 02:29.380
So the second a business owner close one of your leads, you're freaking doing the deal.

02:29.380 --> 02:32.620
However, you do not need to wait for them to close a deal.

02:32.620 --> 02:34.120
So that's something else that gets confused.

02:34.120 --> 02:37.020
You're not just going to send leads and send leads and send leads for them to close the

02:37.020 --> 02:38.020
deal.

02:38.020 --> 02:39.020
That's not how this works.

02:39.020 --> 02:41.900
The purpose isn't for them to make money so they can pay you.

02:41.900 --> 02:46.420
The purpose is for them to see what these are like, for them to go and see the quality

02:46.420 --> 02:49.420
and talk to the customers and see that you're legit.

02:49.420 --> 02:53.740
So they don't even actually have to run the estimates themselves for you to go and close

02:53.740 --> 02:54.740
the deal.

02:54.740 --> 02:57.660
Sometimes I'll send three leads, they'll schedule them, but they're a bit scheduled out so they'll

02:57.660 --> 03:02.020
schedule them for like Thursday, Friday, Monday, and I'm closing the deal on Wednesday.

03:02.020 --> 03:03.660
But they've at least seen these are real customers.

03:03.660 --> 03:04.980
These are people that need estimates.

03:04.980 --> 03:06.300
They want estimates.

03:06.300 --> 03:08.380
These are exclusive leads and that is enough.

03:08.380 --> 03:13.460
So I just want to let you guys know the rule of thumb is I send three to five leads or

03:13.460 --> 03:14.700
they close a deal.

03:15.700 --> 03:17.100
quicker.

03:17.100 --> 03:18.100
That's what I do.

03:18.100 --> 03:22.300
And that's usually a telltale sign that these guys are ready to go.

03:22.300 --> 03:26.340
And then I hop on the phone and then I get on and do the screencast and I hop on the

03:26.340 --> 03:28.040
zoom call and close the deal.

03:28.040 --> 03:31.580
But again, more than anything, I want you guys to know this is a feeling and it's going

03:31.580 --> 03:32.740
to be different on everyone.

03:32.740 --> 03:35.380
It's not going to be, I send three leads, I jump on the phone.

03:35.380 --> 03:36.540
We have these rules of thumb.

03:36.540 --> 03:37.540
We don't send more than five.

03:37.540 --> 03:41.340
We want to send at least three, or if they close one, we have these rules of thumb.

03:41.340 --> 03:42.980
But guys, I want you to trust your gut.

03:42.980 --> 03:44.260
I want you to listen to what they're saying.

03:44.260 --> 03:49.180
I want you to sense when they're ready to go, when the iron is hot, and I want you to

03:49.180 --> 03:49.680
strike.
