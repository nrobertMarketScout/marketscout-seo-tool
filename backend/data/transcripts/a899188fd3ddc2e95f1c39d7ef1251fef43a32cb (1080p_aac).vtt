00:00.000 --> 00:02.580
This is such a crucial thing you guys need to understand,

00:02.580 --> 00:04.740
is you don't need to do the entire due diligence.

00:04.740 --> 00:08.100
If at any point it's not checking the boxes,

00:08.100 --> 00:10.500
get out and go to the next city, okay?

00:10.500 --> 00:13.540
And Melissa, really quick, one thing I wanna just mention

00:13.540 --> 00:16.020
is if you are having a hard time finding cities

00:16.020 --> 00:21.020
with adequate search volume and whatever,

00:21.940 --> 00:24.820
adequate search volume, but low-ish population,

00:24.820 --> 00:28.340
then my advice, go and just do a new niche.

00:28.400 --> 00:30.600
And it doesn't mean you're not gonna come back to concrete,

00:30.600 --> 00:32.720
but sometimes you get so in one niche,

00:32.720 --> 00:36.040
you get so exhausted and burned out

00:36.040 --> 00:37.560
that it just defeats the purpose.

00:37.560 --> 00:40.360
So my advice to you, if you're looking at a bunch of cities,

00:40.360 --> 00:44.720
go do fencing, go try tree service, okay?

00:44.720 --> 00:48.560
Go do that and just try that and see what you find

00:48.560 --> 00:49.760
and it's gonna be refreshing

00:49.760 --> 00:51.880
because you're gonna be into a new niche, okay?
