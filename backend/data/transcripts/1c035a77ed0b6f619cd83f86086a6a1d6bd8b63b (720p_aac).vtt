00:00.000 --> 00:02.600
Dude, tell me about a deal that you've done,

00:02.600 --> 00:05.520
a pitch you've been on, a Zoom close that you didn't close

00:05.520 --> 00:07.040
and what the business owner said.

00:07.040 --> 00:08.040
All right, so just so you know,

00:08.040 --> 00:12.480
I've had five Zoom closes and I'm closed four of those.

00:12.480 --> 00:14.280
So it's just been one.

00:14.280 --> 00:16.360
Hey, all flex, all flex.

00:16.360 --> 00:18.280
I like it, I like it.

00:18.280 --> 00:20.240
Bro, you said you have to flex, so why not?

00:20.240 --> 00:21.600
Dude, I love it, bro.

00:21.600 --> 00:23.560
I wanna see more fucking posts is what I'm saying.

00:23.560 --> 00:24.880
Let's go.

00:24.880 --> 00:25.840
For sure, dude.

00:25.840 --> 00:26.680
Hey, hit me though.

00:26.680 --> 00:27.920
Hit me with the one you didn't close.

00:27.920 --> 00:30.000
The one that I lost was,

00:30.000 --> 00:31.840
they told me at the end of the call

00:31.840 --> 00:33.920
that they had to talk to their spouse.

00:33.920 --> 00:34.760
Okay.

00:34.760 --> 00:38.480
And so I gave them until the next day,

00:38.480 --> 00:39.880
until like around noon.

00:39.880 --> 00:42.240
And then I called them, didn't answer.

00:42.240 --> 00:44.360
And then we started going this back and forth

00:44.360 --> 00:45.440
where he would shoot me a text.

00:45.440 --> 00:46.960
He's like, yeah, call me later, blah, blah, blah.

00:46.960 --> 00:48.880
I would call him and it didn't happen.

00:48.880 --> 00:50.840
And I just ended up getting another business owner

00:50.840 --> 00:51.680
and closing him.

00:51.680 --> 00:54.640
So, but yeah, he just never got back to me.

00:54.640 --> 00:58.120
So that one, was it the spouse or partner

00:58.120 --> 00:59.600
or was the spouse a partner?

00:59.600 --> 01:01.720
Or was like spouse partner or spouse spouse?

01:01.720 --> 01:03.360
Like not involved in the business.

01:04.560 --> 01:06.320
Spouse, spouse.

01:06.320 --> 01:08.080
Yeah, that's a tough one because,

01:08.080 --> 01:10.320
dude, the thing with those is like,

01:10.320 --> 01:12.080
this is the pitch that they got, right?

01:12.080 --> 01:13.880
So he got the phone with you.

01:13.880 --> 01:15.800
He goes to his wife and he goes,

01:15.800 --> 01:19.160
hey honey, there's this guy, he's in North Carolina.

01:19.160 --> 01:22.360
He wants to do leads and it's 1500 bucks a month flat rate.

01:22.360 --> 01:24.120
She's like, fuck no.

01:25.400 --> 01:28.240
She has no involvement in the business.

01:28.240 --> 01:30.920
She wasn't on the call, so you're fucked, right?

01:30.920 --> 01:33.000
So the only thing I would say,

01:33.000 --> 01:35.560
like this is an easy one in the sense that like,

01:35.560 --> 01:38.840
you just gotta make sure upfront that you let them know

01:38.840 --> 01:41.040
that if there's a decision maker

01:41.040 --> 01:43.240
that needs to be on the call other than them

01:43.240 --> 01:46.080
to get them on the call, okay?

01:46.080 --> 01:46.920
Yeah.

01:46.920 --> 01:47.760
That's the only way.

01:47.760 --> 01:52.280
Cause dude, overcoming that shit is really difficult

01:52.280 --> 01:55.160
because like that person doesn't even know

01:55.160 --> 01:57.680
what's going on in the business anyway.

01:57.680 --> 01:58.520
Makes sense?

01:58.520 --> 02:00.120
So here's one thing that I've been doing

02:00.120 --> 02:02.200
and a lot of you guys, I think even probably you,

02:02.200 --> 02:03.440
do you remember the video I sent you

02:03.440 --> 02:05.440
before we jumped on the call?

02:05.440 --> 02:06.720
Yeah, that's what I've been doing.

02:06.720 --> 02:09.880
Like when I send over the screencast right when I end it,

02:09.880 --> 02:12.920
I say, you know, just make sure if there's anybody else

02:12.920 --> 02:14.720
that has to be on the call, bring them on.

02:14.720 --> 02:15.640
That's what I say.

02:15.640 --> 02:19.120
And since then I've had no issues with that objection

02:19.120 --> 02:20.280
or it hasn't come up.

02:20.280 --> 02:23.240
So you did, you started doing that after you lost that deal.

02:24.360 --> 02:25.200
Correct.

02:25.200 --> 02:26.400
That's beautiful.

02:26.400 --> 02:28.400
So all of you guys that are on,

02:28.400 --> 02:29.240
all of you guys that are listening,

02:29.240 --> 02:31.920
that's something I do and I'm showing you an example.

02:31.920 --> 02:34.680
Like the thing is, I know if you're jumping on the call

02:34.680 --> 02:37.800
to talk about FFM, it's probably a good fit.

02:37.800 --> 02:40.320
Like you've seen the videos, you want to grow,

02:40.320 --> 02:41.160
but guess what?

02:41.160 --> 02:42.440
People get weird, people get nervous,

02:42.440 --> 02:43.400
people do all these things.

02:43.400 --> 02:45.560
So I don't want that to be an objection.

02:45.560 --> 02:47.440
So I send that video out and you guys know,

02:47.440 --> 02:50.080
I kind of made an over exaggeration

02:51.040 --> 02:53.960
if you need to bring your dog, your goldfish,

02:53.960 --> 02:57.480
your spouse or Jesus, bring them to the call

02:57.480 --> 03:00.960
because I ain't doing, I want to think about it bullshit.

03:00.960 --> 03:04.560
So you can say it a lot less confrontational,

03:04.560 --> 03:06.480
but nonetheless, it's the same concept.

03:06.480 --> 03:10.440
So I like that weaving it into the pre-closed screencast

03:10.440 --> 03:11.520
is brilliant, dude.

03:11.520 --> 03:13.040
I love that.

03:13.040 --> 03:14.160
It's exactly what I do.

03:14.160 --> 03:16.160
And it's also part of the training.

03:16.160 --> 03:18.280
It's like, the other thing too,

03:18.360 --> 03:20.760
is while you're doing the calls and the leads,

03:20.760 --> 03:23.040
you could also, hey, so is it just you

03:23.040 --> 03:24.000
or is it your partner?

03:24.000 --> 03:25.520
Like, do you have a partner?

03:25.520 --> 03:26.920
Is your spouse involved?

03:26.920 --> 03:28.760
But I would definitely say,

03:28.760 --> 03:30.400
is there anyone else that needs to be involved

03:30.400 --> 03:31.360
like in this decision?

03:31.360 --> 03:33.760
And you can, instead of being like,

03:33.760 --> 03:35.640
making it like a lot of buying pressure,

03:35.640 --> 03:39.080
just say, look, man, I don't want to play telephone

03:39.080 --> 03:40.560
where I tell you everything.

03:40.560 --> 03:42.800
You got to go to your wife or your partner

03:42.800 --> 03:44.440
and then half of it's missing.

03:44.440 --> 03:45.280
And then it's like,

03:45.280 --> 03:46.680
I don't want to have to pitch this twice.

03:46.680 --> 03:48.280
So get them on the call.

03:48.280 --> 03:51.480
And literally when you jump on, say, hey, so we're good.

03:51.480 --> 03:53.440
Like there's no one else who needs to be on this call.

03:53.440 --> 03:54.280
Okay, cool.

03:54.280 --> 03:57.160
And if they say, yes, cool, we're rescheduling this bitch

03:57.160 --> 03:58.960
because I ain't going to do this twice.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.720
But dude, it sounds like you already knew the answer

04:01.720 --> 04:03.640
but I'm really glad you came on to tell everyone.

04:03.640 --> 04:05.040
And that's definitely something you guys

04:05.040 --> 04:08.160
should be incorporating at the end of your Zoom close

04:08.160 --> 04:10.200
or your screencast just to mention,

04:10.200 --> 04:13.160
hey, if there's anybody else, get them on the call.

04:13.160 --> 04:15.520
And if that means we need to reschedule, I'm okay with it

04:15.520 --> 04:18.360
but it's going to be way more beneficial for both of us

04:18.360 --> 04:19.560
to get them on the call.

04:21.040 --> 04:23.240
Yeah, can I say one last thing before I get off?

04:23.240 --> 04:25.560
Please, please, please.

04:25.560 --> 04:28.720
So usually what I've done and I did the same thing

04:28.720 --> 04:30.680
with that person that I lost the deal with

04:30.680 --> 04:33.680
was when I'm sending over the leads,

04:33.680 --> 04:35.720
whenever I get on the phone with them

04:35.720 --> 04:38.160
and I feel like they're not that busy

04:38.160 --> 04:40.880
and they have a couple of minutes to talk

04:40.880 --> 04:43.280
and I ask them all the questions about your closing rate,

04:43.800 --> 04:47.400
your profit margin, right there I incorporate that question

04:47.400 --> 04:49.520
of like, are you the sole decision maker?

04:49.520 --> 04:52.200
Do you have like any other partners or whatever?

04:52.200 --> 04:54.720
And so with that person, I did the same

04:54.720 --> 04:58.720
but I didn't bring it up on the screencast, right?

04:58.720 --> 05:00.720
And last thing I'll say, dude,

05:00.720 --> 05:03.000
is I couldn't agree more with you

05:03.000 --> 05:05.640
when it comes to the entire setup.

05:05.640 --> 05:07.800
And the reason why I say that was

05:07.800 --> 05:11.520
the last deal that I closed, this guy has a partner.

05:11.520 --> 05:12.960
They run a concrete company.

05:13.640 --> 05:15.040
They do about $3 million a year.

05:15.040 --> 05:18.400
So he obviously has partners and nobody came on the call.

05:18.400 --> 05:19.560
It was just him.

05:19.560 --> 05:22.680
And it was the easiest sale of my life.

05:22.680 --> 05:23.520
And why?

05:23.520 --> 05:25.680
Because of the setup, because I did it properly.

05:25.680 --> 05:28.200
So as long as you do the setup correctly,

05:28.200 --> 05:29.720
you're gonna get the deal, man.

05:29.720 --> 05:31.320
So that's what I wanted to say.
