How many ads can you run on regular ads if it's not an MCC?

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,320
Good question. Does anyone know? Is there a max?

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:12,800
I've ran like 20 on my brand new account. It's like three weeks old, over 20.

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:18,640
And that's on like one account, the Gmail, one account, and then just 20 campaigns inside of that?

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,880
20 campaigns inside of it, yes. I have to like scroll down to see all my smart campaigns.

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,920
So we know, Yvette, at least 20. Well, we'll see. I have a feeling Archer's

7
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,600
going to push the envelope on that. Yeah, I'm slapping five more up today.

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,720
I love it. Okay.
