00:00.000 --> 00:09.800
Okay, now that we have the page title and the page description, we are going to create

00:09.800 --> 00:12.840
the H1 tag, text right here.

00:12.840 --> 00:19.440
It's actually pretty simple because the H1 is pretty much the page title just flipped.

00:19.440 --> 00:25.520
So we're going to put the location first and then we're going to put the services.

00:25.520 --> 00:31.500
So just what you put here, we put concrete contractors and concrete company.

00:31.500 --> 00:37.240
So I'm literally just going to put, so I'm going to click in it and I'm going to put

00:37.240 --> 00:43.480
my location, which is in my case, Queen Creek, Arizona, and then you can structure this however

00:43.480 --> 00:44.480
you like.

00:44.480 --> 00:49.560
I think it looks clean if you put a little line there, but you can also just go ahead

00:49.560 --> 00:52.600
and just put the keywords that we used.

00:52.600 --> 01:00.280
So concrete contractors.

01:00.280 --> 01:06.920
This may be too long to fit, also I'm putting that, but I usually like to use the actual

01:06.920 --> 01:15.080
three letters and concrete company and then click out of it.

01:15.080 --> 01:17.760
Let's see what it looks like, okay.

01:17.760 --> 01:24.080
I do like it to be a little more bold and then just double check how it looks like from

01:24.080 --> 01:25.880
a phone.

01:25.880 --> 01:27.720
Yeah, that's fine.

01:27.720 --> 01:32.080
Keep in mind, I know this sounds like silly, but we're only doing this because Google is

01:32.080 --> 01:37.640
going to crawl our website and we're just doing the on-page SEO.

01:37.640 --> 01:42.960
We're not doing this to make it look, because obviously this is the same thing.

01:43.160 --> 01:44.160
Oops.

01:44.160 --> 01:47.240
And then make sure you don't put concrete twice.

01:50.240 --> 01:52.240
Okay, let's delete that out.

01:55.240 --> 01:57.240
Perfect, it should look even better now.

02:00.240 --> 02:03.040
Okay, concrete contractors and concrete company.

02:03.040 --> 02:06.160
You may ask, well, can I just put concrete contractors and company?

02:06.160 --> 02:10.640
No, because the keyword is concrete company, not just company.

02:11.320 --> 02:14.320
You might as well just take out concrete company and just leave concrete contractors if it's

02:14.320 --> 02:16.320
really bugging you.

02:16.320 --> 02:19.320
Okay, next one, stamped concrete.

02:19.320 --> 02:21.320
Okay, same thing.

02:21.320 --> 02:23.320
Same thing as your page title.

02:23.320 --> 02:27.320
Location first, so you flip the page title.

02:30.320 --> 02:40.320
Oops, stamped concrete and decorative concrete.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
Make it a little bigger.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Perfect.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
Okay, concrete driveway.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
I don't remember.

02:46.000 --> 02:53.000
I think concrete installers is what we put, okay.

02:53.000 --> 03:06.000
Queen Creek, Arizona, concrete driveway, and concrete installers.

03:06.680 --> 03:08.680
Make it a little bigger.

03:08.680 --> 03:10.680
Perfect.

03:10.680 --> 03:12.680
Concrete patio.

03:14.680 --> 03:26.680
Queen Creek, Arizona, concrete patio, and concrete walkway.

03:27.360 --> 03:37.360
Okay, and you're done because we're not doing the contact page.

03:37.360 --> 03:42.360
We are also going to cover the meta keywords.

03:42.360 --> 03:46.360
So, we used to fill this section right here.

03:46.360 --> 03:53.360
We don't do it anymore on our very latest sites, but this is up to you if you want to

03:53.360 --> 03:54.360
do it or not.

03:55.040 --> 03:59.040
We don't think that it's going to hurt you if you put meta keywords, but we're not sure

03:59.040 --> 04:01.040
that it's really doing much by adding them.

04:01.040 --> 04:03.040
So, what meta keywords are, it's very simple.

04:03.040 --> 04:06.040
I'm just going to show you how to do it on the home page.

04:06.040 --> 04:11.040
It's pretty much you just add in keywords from your keyword list, and you separate them

04:11.040 --> 04:12.040
with a comma.

04:12.040 --> 04:15.040
And it will tell you right here, separate each with a comma.

04:15.040 --> 04:18.040
So, it would be concrete contractors.

04:18.040 --> 04:21.040
It is just a list of keywords.

04:21.720 --> 04:25.720
Concrete company, stamped concrete.

04:25.720 --> 04:30.720
Make sure that when you're doing this, you're not just copying and pasting it from...

04:30.720 --> 04:34.720
Like, don't ever copy the description for the home page and put it in the service page.

04:34.720 --> 04:39.720
Everything needs to be authentic and made fresh for each page.

04:39.720 --> 04:40.720
Same with the meta keywords.

04:40.720 --> 04:44.720
Even if you're using the same keywords over and over, it doesn't matter.

04:44.720 --> 04:46.720
Don't ever copy and paste.

04:46.720 --> 04:48.720
Flip them, you know, switch them.

04:49.400 --> 04:52.400
If you're writing everything fresh, you're never going to have that issue.

04:52.400 --> 04:55.400
So, just try not to do that.

04:55.400 --> 05:02.400
Concrete driveway and concrete patio.

05:02.400 --> 05:03.400
Okay.

05:03.400 --> 05:08.400
And that is it for H1 titles and meta keywords.
