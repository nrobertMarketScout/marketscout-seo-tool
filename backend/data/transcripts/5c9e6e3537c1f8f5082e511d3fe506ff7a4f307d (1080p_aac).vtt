00:00.000 --> 00:01.400
You transfer each lead every time.

00:01.400 --> 00:03.960
And in the beginning, yes, the three to five phone calls.

00:03.960 --> 00:06.320
That's the, that's part of the setup that Nick's talks about.

00:06.580 --> 00:08.800
You have to transfer every lead live.

00:08.820 --> 00:10.080
You know, you have to value that lead.

00:10.640 --> 00:10.920
Yep.

00:11.180 --> 00:11.680
I agree.

00:11.680 --> 00:15.360
And, and the thing is, you guys think it'll be a pain to do the live transfers,

00:15.360 --> 00:18.980
but I promise you like B before he was trying to sell the site and he was

00:19.020 --> 00:21.600
sending handfuls and droves of leads.

00:21.900 --> 00:24.060
And then it was wondering why the hell he couldn't close it.

00:24.060 --> 00:26.920
Now he's only has to send three to four leads over a 24 hour period.

00:26.920 --> 00:29.180
And he's locking down $40,000 deals.

00:29.460 --> 00:32.140
It's because he can control the whole process, make sure the

00:32.140 --> 00:35.020
client's answering, make sure the lead is good, make sure the lead answers.

00:35.340 --> 00:39.940
And he can literally like hand just like the Costco sample strategy in the module.

00:40.260 --> 00:45.140
You can literally force feed the, the, the, the quiche into their mouth.

00:45.180 --> 00:48.020
Like they can't walk around the corner and throw it away because you're

00:48.020 --> 00:49.580
doing it, you're handing it off.

00:49.600 --> 00:49.940
Right.
