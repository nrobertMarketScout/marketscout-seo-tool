Nick, have you tried the painting niche you painted out?
Never done it.
Um, don't love it just because it's kind of like drywall, just some of those
construction niches where like the, the builders, they have their guy, they have
their crew and everything else is those bullshit little jobs.
I don't love it.
I think you could squeeze a deal out of it.
It's not a niche I'm going vertical with though, but good question.
