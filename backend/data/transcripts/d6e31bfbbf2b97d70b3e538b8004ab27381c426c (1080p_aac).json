Hey, I got this job. I could say, I don't know, just try different things. If you can't get any of them to pick up, that seems very, very interesting and very, very weird. But I would try a couple of those things first, guys. We just got to get that attention, get them to answer. We've got to have a chance at it. Of course, worst case scenario, you could always send an email. It's my least favorite option, but yeah, you could always try a text message. Just don't give too much information away.
