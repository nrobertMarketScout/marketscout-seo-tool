Hey, Simon says, how can we measure market saturation for digital assets?

00:06.120 --> 00:09.280
That's that I might need you to give a little bit more information on that.

00:09.280 --> 00:11.880
Maybe you can and I can answer it on a on a comment.

00:11.880 --> 00:16.560
But guys, I'm telling you, those of you guys that are worried about saturation,

00:16.560 --> 00:18.360
we are there.

00:18.360 --> 00:20.320
Go watch my videos, type in saturation.

00:20.320 --> 00:22.160
Is ranking saturated on YouTube?

00:22.160 --> 00:24.080
And go listen to my logical answers.

00:24.080 --> 00:26.440
OK, this is not saturated.

00:26.760 --> 00:30.680
And just because you guys are seeing other rank and rep people, other marketers,

00:30.680 --> 00:32.560
does not mean it's saturated.

00:32.560 --> 00:35.360
Just because there's someone else, the website doesn't mean you can't have one.

00:35.360 --> 00:38.840
Just because there's somebody else that, you know, sorry,

00:38.960 --> 00:42.720
just because there is somebody that has a website in your niche and city

00:42.720 --> 00:44.240
does not mean they even have a client.

00:44.240 --> 00:46.640
It doesn't even mean that they're even in the business anymore.

00:46.640 --> 00:49.360
It doesn't mean that they know how to sell and create a deal.

00:49.840 --> 00:52.840
You guys have to remember that those websites that you guys see

00:52.840 --> 00:55.600
and get so scared of there are just like another local business.

00:55.600 --> 00:57.920
OK, don't worry about that. Keep going.
