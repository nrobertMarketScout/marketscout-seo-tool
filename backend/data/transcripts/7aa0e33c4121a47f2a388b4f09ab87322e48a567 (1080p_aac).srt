Hey, guys, we're going to show this this video clip is going to kind of highlight something that's going to happen after you set up your first Google search campaign. And it'll probably happen a few days after it goes live, possibly up to a week later. And you're going to see these optimization scores. You want to have I like to have my optimization scores like above 95% as much as possible. So for anyone that's been around in the group for a while, we we started with smart campaigns, because

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:01:00,000
it was literally like you set it up and you forget it. And you just it's very light maintenance on it. As those became more and more maintenance heavy, talking to Nick and other people in the group, we said, you know, let's just make the change to these search campaigns. That's why we're doing that. And the reason why we avoided it in the very beginning was because there's a lot of maintenance that goes into them. We didn't have to deal with that with certain with the smart campaigns. But now we're in a new world. And that's what we're doing. So one of the things you're going to see is you're going to see these recommendations. And you're going to think, Oh, my God,

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:30,000
gosh, I'm getting punished or penalized or whatever. And you're not. The big thing you got to think about here is that Google is an advertising company, and they want their money. Okay. And for the lead gen stuff and the services that we're involved in doing, we don't really need all of these things. Okay. We can do some maybe advanced training later to go over some of these. But for the most part, what you do is you come into your ad, you go down to recommendations, and it'll tell you what your optimization score is. And then what it's going to do, it's going to tell you all these things. It's

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:02:00,000
going to tell you add broad match keywords. We don't want broad match keywords. So what I do is you go to see the three dots right here, we click that I go to dismiss all. Okay. And then at dismiss all, I either put I will do it later. I do not think this will improve my performance. It doesn't matter. And then I hit dismiss all and I want you to watch my optimization score increase. Boom, it just jumped 8%. Okay. So again, Google, what Google is asking is Google is trying to get you to do certain things. I'm not saying that they're all

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:30,000
bad. But a lot of it is trying to get more money and wasteful ad spend. So that's why we're that's why we're showing you this. So you know, so you're not enticed to click this and add it and do that. And then you're going to be wondering why your ads blowing all this money and everything else. So here's another one for site links. Okay, you don't need site links when you start it there. There is a benefit to them. I will we will do another video later once everyone kind of gets on board with this. But same thing I hit the three thought three, three

6
00:02:30,000 --> 00:03:00,000
dots. And then I'm going to put I will do it later. And I hit dismiss all. And boom, now I'm up in 95 and a half. Right? customer match list. This isn't a business that has a bunch of emails and customer data. I don't need it. So I to go up here, or I can put this is not relevant. Okay. And then it's going to want to sometimes they do offer you good keywords. Sometimes they don't. So it's up to you. You can take a look at them and analyze them. And if there's something that you're missing, or you think would be good, go ahead and add them. It's not

7
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:30,000
a big deal. Just make sure that their phrase match and not broad match. But for the purposes of this video, I'm just going to dismiss it. Okay, and then these other ones are just other stuff, but they don't have any score on my optimization. And just like that, my optimization score went from 83 to 99.9. And it's as simple as that. So we just wanted to show you that video. So you guys understand it, because this is going to happen, you're going to open it up, you're gonna be like, I'm at a 77. Oh, my gosh. And Google's telling me to do all these things. And that's, that's

8
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:39,280
all you have to do is three dots, dismiss all, put whatever reason you want here, dismiss all and your optimization score goes up just like that. Okay.
