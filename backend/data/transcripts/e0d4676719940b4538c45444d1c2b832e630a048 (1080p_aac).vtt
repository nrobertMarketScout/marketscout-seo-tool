00:00.000 --> 00:04.680
Guys, happy Monday.

00:04.680 --> 00:08.080
February 24th.

00:08.080 --> 00:15.280
Time is cruising by, which is not a bad thing when you're getting stuff done.

00:15.280 --> 00:19.600
One thing I want to say really quick, I actually told my, I think a lot of you guys are inside

00:19.600 --> 00:27.040
of Digital Landlords, so I'm going to just remind you guys, if you have not ever, or

00:27.240 --> 00:34.240
even if you have, I highly, highly, highly, highly, highly recommend you guys read this

00:34.240 --> 00:35.340
book.

00:35.340 --> 00:38.040
It's called The Slight Edge, okay?

00:38.040 --> 00:42.000
I'll show you the cover here real quick.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.680
I cannot recommend this book enough.

00:43.680 --> 00:47.720
I've got, yeah, Craig Smith, he's reading it, awesome, okay.

00:47.720 --> 00:53.680
So this is what the cover looks like, okay, it's called The Slight Edge.

00:53.680 --> 00:58.520
I'm on page 205, I don't know if that's, I'm on chapter 14, so I've just been reading

00:58.520 --> 01:07.560
10 pages a day, and guys, this book has just reminded me that it's all the little things

01:07.560 --> 01:13.400
that you do that add up to the success, and you're going to start reading this today,

01:13.400 --> 01:17.500
and you're going to start to implement some little things, and you're not going to see

01:17.500 --> 01:19.900
any results at the beginning.

01:19.900 --> 01:23.280
It's going to feel like the exact same thing, whether it's, you know, let's just talk with

01:23.280 --> 01:24.280
the business, right?

01:24.280 --> 01:27.120
You're going to start to implement some things with the business.

01:27.120 --> 01:34.760
Maybe your goal is, I'm going to make five cold calls, I'm going to make sure every single

01:34.760 --> 01:41.800
day I talk to five business owners, I talk to five business owners with cold calling,

01:41.800 --> 01:42.800
okay?

01:42.800 --> 01:48.400
Not call, but talk to, and you're going to do it the first day, and you might not even

01:48.400 --> 01:52.440
get anybody that's interested, and maybe the second day and the third day, you might do

01:52.440 --> 01:53.440
it for a week.

01:53.440 --> 01:56.840
You might do it for two weeks, because at the beginning your pitch isn't great, and

01:56.840 --> 02:01.720
then what's going to happen is after a week, two weeks, you're going to start seeing that

02:01.720 --> 02:09.040
somebody that you called day three actually calls you back, or somebody that you called,

02:09.040 --> 02:14.600
you know, on day four that didn't answer, got your voice note, your voice memo, they

02:14.600 --> 02:19.240
called you, they're interested, and all of a sudden all these little things that you

02:20.000 --> 02:25.000
They start to stack up, and it's like everything is going in your way, and you have this thing

02:25.000 --> 02:28.480
called momentum, and it's a beautiful feeling.

02:28.480 --> 02:30.080
I have it right now.

02:30.080 --> 02:37.120
I started this book literally a month ago, because I got back, I was in, I remember,

02:37.120 --> 02:41.440
it was about this exact same day, almost exactly a month ago I started it.

02:41.440 --> 02:48.600
I picked it up, I was kind of like, you know, I need to just get back to basics, fundamentals,

02:48.600 --> 02:53.000
picked up the book, just read 10 pages, and then did it again, did it again, did it again,

02:53.000 --> 02:56.360
and guys, it's been really, really good.

02:56.360 --> 02:59.000
I've seen, I mean, I've got a lot of momentum, I feel good.

02:59.000 --> 03:05.880
It's not just my business too, it's my physical, my, what other side of it.

03:05.880 --> 03:12.200
I feel like with my physical definitely, with my relationships, so anyway, I don't make

03:12.200 --> 03:16.520
any money off this book, I don't know Jeff Olson, all I can tell you is that I've recommended

03:16.520 --> 03:20.920
this book to not just my digital landlords group, but I've recommended this to a bunch

03:20.920 --> 03:23.320
of people that I know and care about.

03:23.320 --> 03:25.280
So guys, go grab it.

03:25.280 --> 03:29.400
This is one of my top five books, maybe my top three books, along with Think and Grow

03:29.400 --> 03:30.400
Rich.

03:30.400 --> 03:33.120
That's how much I like this book, it's like my fourth time reading it.

03:33.120 --> 03:42.320
So there is a PDF that I shared, you can grab, just for ease of, I'll just go like this,

03:42.320 --> 03:46.560
the Slide Edge PDF, let me just grab it for you guys to make it easy.

03:46.560 --> 03:49.360
You can just type in the Slide Edge PDF and you're also going to find it, but let me just

03:49.360 --> 03:51.560
go like this and I'll drop it in.

03:51.560 --> 03:57.760
Okay, so yeah, you guys can get the PDF there, I like it on the Kindle so I can highlight

03:57.760 --> 04:05.320
stuff and come back to it, drop notes in it, but anyway, all right guys, that is that.

04:05.320 --> 04:09.880
What else was I going to say really quick before we dive into the questions, let's see.

04:10.840 --> 04:12.800
Okay, here we go, let me show you guys.

04:12.800 --> 04:17.520
All right, and I'm doing this because I know not everyone's on right now, but I'm going

04:17.520 --> 04:23.360
to share my screen really quick for, let's see, we got Craig, Kevin, Paul, Simon, okay.

04:25.360 --> 04:27.360
There's the PDF by the way.

04:29.360 --> 04:35.720
Okay, last week, and I think a couple weeks ago too, I said, hey guys, when you go through

04:35.720 --> 04:42.320
the classroom here, there's this mini course called Community World Map, okay, and I asked

04:42.320 --> 04:43.520
everyone to put their location.

04:43.520 --> 04:46.920
Why does it matter if you put your location, well, you don't have to put your location,

04:46.920 --> 04:51.240
but I think it's really cool to put your location because, well, first of all, it's interesting

04:51.240 --> 04:52.240
to look at.

04:52.240 --> 04:57.680
Number two, it's cool because if you're traveling or you're anywhere and you want to link up

04:57.680 --> 05:01.880
with somebody, you can just go and look at who's in that area, right.

05:01.880 --> 05:04.440
We have over 250 members.

05:04.440 --> 05:08.620
If everyone would fill this out, which a lot of us are in this area, it would be so interesting

05:08.620 --> 05:12.120
to see where everybody's at, so I'm going to, I think I wasn't super clear and I didn't

05:12.120 --> 05:13.280
even know this.

05:13.280 --> 05:18.840
So I thought all you had to do, guys, is go, this is what I thought.

05:18.840 --> 05:23.800
I thought you went to your profile, you went to your settings, and you changed your location.

05:23.800 --> 05:25.160
That's what I thought, okay.

05:25.160 --> 05:26.160
It's not the case.

05:26.160 --> 05:30.620
What you got to do is you got to go here, you got to go to the classroom, you're going

05:30.620 --> 05:37.780
to go to the map, of course, and then you're going to see this little purple button here.

05:37.780 --> 05:42.860
You're just going to click on this and you're going to put add a location, okay.

05:42.860 --> 05:46.640
Now I'm going to go back to another window here.

05:46.640 --> 05:50.180
You're going to grab your, you're going to go to your profile and you're going to grab

05:50.180 --> 05:58.140
this and you're just going to go into here and drop that.

05:58.140 --> 06:02.700
Nicholas Wood, and then I'm going to put my location as Freetown.

06:02.700 --> 06:06.660
I'm in the U.S. right now, but I'm going to be in Freetown in two weeks, so I'll put Freetown

06:06.660 --> 06:13.300
and I'll submit it, and boom, there we go.

06:13.300 --> 06:17.240
It drops me right here into Freetown, okay.

06:17.240 --> 06:22.080
So guys, if you haven't done this already, it takes, what did that take me, 15 seconds?

06:22.080 --> 06:23.080
Go do it.

06:23.080 --> 06:26.380
I think it's so, I think it's really cool to look at first and foremost, and I think

06:26.380 --> 06:32.660
it's so interesting to be able to connect with people and to just build the network.

06:32.660 --> 06:36.220
I mean, guys, we're all trying to do the same thing and we're all at different stages of

06:36.220 --> 06:37.220
the game.

06:37.220 --> 06:38.660
We all come with different experience that we can tap into.

06:38.660 --> 06:42.140
So guys, take two seconds today to do that.

06:42.140 --> 06:43.140
Super easy.

06:43.140 --> 06:45.020
Let's see really quick.

06:45.020 --> 06:51.860
Simon says, can you highlight the difference between the mini course and the digital language

06:51.860 --> 06:52.860
program?

06:52.860 --> 06:53.860
Yes.

06:54.340 --> 07:02.120
So in a nutshell, Simon, this group right now, thanks Paul for doing that by the way,

07:02.120 --> 07:06.180
this program that you're in right now, this Rankin' Rankin' Academy, the school community,

07:06.180 --> 07:08.460
if you are in digital language, you have full access to this.

07:08.460 --> 07:16.180
I think Craig, Kevin, and Paul, I think are all in digital language, if I'm not mistaken.

07:16.180 --> 07:19.740
And essentially, this is just a place to get your feet wet, okay.

07:19.740 --> 07:28.820
This is a place to understand from a conceptual level, the model, to get some pointers on

07:28.820 --> 07:34.500
how to get started, to start seeing some wins in terms of like just moving the needle and

07:34.500 --> 07:36.180
getting going, okay.

07:36.180 --> 07:39.500
But digital landlords is when you do it for real.

07:39.500 --> 07:43.100
So that's going to have everything and anything related to this.

07:43.100 --> 07:44.280
It's going to have all the scripts.

07:44.280 --> 07:49.020
It's going to have, I mean, it's got everything that you can possibly imagine.

07:49.020 --> 07:54.500
And so like everything, if something new comes up, if I'm testing something new with ads,

07:54.500 --> 07:55.500
I share it in there.

07:55.500 --> 08:01.700
If I have this new strategy that I'm doing for prospecting, I share it in there.

08:01.700 --> 08:03.780
It's basically got every single thing.

08:03.780 --> 08:04.840
It's the blueprint.

08:04.840 --> 08:08.580
So that is what digital landlords is.

08:08.580 --> 08:09.580
So this is just the starter.

08:09.580 --> 08:13.300
This is where you start and determine, hey, I want to go into this model for real.

08:13.300 --> 08:18.180
And as soon as you are like, hey, I want to do this for real, then you go in and get into

08:18.180 --> 08:19.180
digital landlords.

08:19.180 --> 08:20.180
Okay.

08:20.180 --> 08:27.780
One thing I will show you really quick on that note is if you, Simon, you should go

08:27.780 --> 08:30.540
check out chapter 14.

08:30.540 --> 08:33.820
If I can find it off the top of my head, let's see here.

08:33.820 --> 08:34.820
I'm guessing here.

08:34.820 --> 08:38.580
Let's see if I'm close on 14.

08:38.580 --> 08:39.580
I think I'm a little further.

08:39.580 --> 08:40.580
Okay.

08:40.580 --> 08:41.580
So let me go right here.

08:41.580 --> 08:42.580
This is the section.

08:42.580 --> 08:44.700
Again, this is a, oh here, 13.

08:44.700 --> 08:46.020
Go read this.

08:46.020 --> 08:48.620
I read this last night.

08:48.620 --> 08:51.900
This chapter called Learn from Mentors.

08:51.900 --> 08:54.980
And this is such an amazing chapter.

08:54.980 --> 08:59.140
And I don't tell you to do this just because I think, oh, if he'll read this, he's going

08:59.140 --> 09:00.860
to get into our program.

09:00.860 --> 09:01.860
No.

09:01.860 --> 09:05.900
But even me reading this, I love this chapter.

09:05.900 --> 09:10.140
And he shares this really amazing story about this guy that just gave him a little bit of

09:10.140 --> 09:11.900
time every single day.

09:11.900 --> 09:14.380
And he started to see himself differently and it completely changed his life.

09:14.740 --> 09:18.820
But anyway, there's some good stuff that I highlighted.

09:18.820 --> 09:19.820
I didn't read it on here.

09:19.820 --> 09:23.780
I read it on right here.

09:23.780 --> 09:26.940
Let me just read this one part, okay?

09:26.940 --> 09:30.300
Let's go like this.

09:30.300 --> 09:35.740
Whatever goals you aspire to, seek out people who have achieved the same or very similar

09:35.740 --> 09:40.940
goals or who are well along that path and go camp on their doorstep or do whatever you

09:40.940 --> 09:45.420
can to associate with them, emulate them, and let their grasp, understanding, and mastery

09:45.420 --> 09:47.740
of the subject rub off on you.

09:47.740 --> 09:50.980
What makes AA so successful is not the information they hand out.

09:50.980 --> 09:54.820
It's the mentorship they provide, both as a community and as individuals.

09:54.820 --> 09:58.620
When you join AA or any other 12-step program, you get instant access to a community of people

09:58.620 --> 10:04.220
who have gone where you're going as well as an individual, mentor, or sponsor.

10:04.220 --> 10:09.260
So this is one of five things I highlighted about this chapter.

10:09.260 --> 10:10.260
Go read chapter 13.

10:10.580 --> 10:11.580
Again, get the PDF.

10:11.580 --> 10:16.940
You can read chapter 13 completely free today, and I think it's going to open your mind on

10:16.940 --> 10:17.940
a lot of things.

10:17.940 --> 10:18.940
Okay?

10:18.940 --> 10:19.940
So yeah, go check it out.

10:19.940 --> 10:20.940
Phenomenal book.

10:20.940 --> 10:24.140
So let's keep going.

10:24.140 --> 10:25.620
Was one more thing I wanted to cover.

10:25.620 --> 10:27.340
Oh, yeah, this is exciting.

10:27.340 --> 10:33.260
Guys, I got a new course dropping in March, just as a heads up, okay?

10:33.260 --> 10:34.380
I've got a new course.

10:34.380 --> 10:39.580
This is going to be a course that, again, for you guys that are in Digital Landlords,

10:39.900 --> 10:44.260
all the stuff that I produce in here, you guys are going to get access to, and it's

10:44.260 --> 10:48.300
probably just a, anything that I produce in here is probably just going to be a fraction

10:48.300 --> 10:51.180
of something that I already have inside of Digital Landlords, okay?

10:51.180 --> 10:56.620
But I will tell you guys, I do have a new course dropping inside of here in March.

10:56.620 --> 11:00.060
So keep an eye out for that as well, okay?

11:00.060 --> 11:02.900
And then lastly, guys, is just a reminder of the replays.

11:02.900 --> 11:08.700
As soon as this call gets done, I upload it to Vimeo, I message my VA, and he waits for

11:08.820 --> 11:14.020
it, he grabs it, and he puts it up within literally like an hour or two hours.

11:14.020 --> 11:16.340
Let me show you one more thing, and then I'm going to go into Q&A.

11:16.340 --> 11:19.220
Okay, guys, let me show you one last thing.

11:19.220 --> 11:26.020
Okay, last thing I want to show you guys is something that I think is really helpful.

11:26.020 --> 11:30.360
So as soon as you get off, you can check this out.

11:30.360 --> 11:37.300
So if you go here, you go down to the replays right here, the replay will be dropped.

11:37.300 --> 11:41.460
So you can see here, this is our kickoff call, so this is our 1, 2, 3, 4, 5th, this

11:41.460 --> 11:46.820
is our 6th week, right, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6th, I'm actually going to have him add the date.

11:46.820 --> 11:51.460
I'll make a note to have him add the date today because I want you guys to be able to

11:51.460 --> 12:00.260
see the date, let me write that down, add dates, dates to replay.

12:00.260 --> 12:04.980
But needless to say, guys, what I like about these, we just started doing, is you can go

12:04.980 --> 12:09.460
to it and we actually put the questions in the description that we answer.

12:09.460 --> 12:15.180
So last week we covered, are there niches that are not region-specific, what is the

12:15.180 --> 12:19.100
backlink data and where is the backlink data from, where are they coming from, like we

12:19.100 --> 12:23.540
go through everything, do one-page websites rank well, all the questions that were asked,

12:23.540 --> 12:24.540
we put in the description.

12:24.540 --> 12:28.060
So you can go to these Q&As and be like, all right, is any of this stuff things that I

12:28.060 --> 12:31.940
actually am interested in or that I have questions about, and then you don't have to go and watch

12:31.940 --> 12:34.140
the entire thing, okay?

12:34.140 --> 12:39.260
Maybe what I should try to do is see if I can do a timestamp, I'll add that as well,

12:39.260 --> 12:41.220
make it even easier for you guys.

12:41.220 --> 12:44.060
But I also want you guys to be on these lives, so maybe I shouldn't make it too easy on you

12:44.060 --> 12:45.060
guys.

12:45.060 --> 12:48.580
I like when you guys are on these lives, it gives me a lot of energy to be able to talk

12:48.580 --> 12:49.580
to you guys live.

12:49.580 --> 12:53.820
Even if no one showed up to this, I would still do these calls, but yeah, just so you

12:53.820 --> 12:54.820
guys know.

12:54.820 --> 12:56.380
All right, guys, what questions do you have?

12:56.380 --> 12:57.380
Let's get into that.

12:57.380 --> 13:02.780
Let me look under the school community while I look or I wait for you guys, let me see

13:02.940 --> 13:05.900
what questions we had.

13:05.900 --> 13:09.260
And let's get into this, okay?

13:09.260 --> 13:12.260
Let's see.

13:12.260 --> 13:19.460
Oh, that's why I already recommended this book in this group as well, I'm sorry.

13:19.460 --> 13:20.460
That's why people said they're reading it.

13:20.460 --> 13:22.820
Book is changing my life, I forgot.

13:22.820 --> 13:23.820
I was so pumped.

13:23.820 --> 13:28.060
After I started seeing the results of this book, I started sharing it with everybody.

13:28.060 --> 13:30.260
Okay, let's see.

13:30.260 --> 13:31.260
I don't know if there was any.

13:31.260 --> 13:36.980
Let me go under the question section, let's see.

13:36.980 --> 13:39.780
There's any new stuff?

13:39.780 --> 13:43.940
If not, I'll go into, I have another place I'll answer questions to make it easy for

13:43.940 --> 13:46.540
you guys, but I'm going to keep an eye on the chat here.

13:46.540 --> 13:49.180
So, guys, if you guys have any questions, let me know.

13:49.180 --> 13:50.180
This is what I'll do.

13:50.180 --> 13:55.340
I'm going to go over to, I'm going to go over to YouTube really quick.

13:55.340 --> 13:59.900
I always get interesting questions here.

13:59.900 --> 14:00.900
Let's see.

14:00.900 --> 14:11.940
All right, I'm going to go to my comments to see what questions we have.

14:11.940 --> 14:12.940
Here's a good question.

14:12.940 --> 14:13.940
I'm going to answer.

14:13.940 --> 14:15.580
Guys, again, I'm going to prioritize your questions.

14:15.580 --> 14:19.620
I'm just going to start going through a few questions in YouTube and then also in the

14:19.620 --> 14:24.620
Facebook group and obviously, school, if I see anything pop up, but yeah, I'll prioritize

14:24.620 --> 14:26.340
your questions as they come up, okay?

14:26.340 --> 14:29.360
So this is a question that somebody had.

14:29.360 --> 14:36.840
This was on a video that I posted on YouTube that was talking about how the rank and rep

14:36.840 --> 14:37.840
business has changed.

14:37.840 --> 14:38.840
This person said this.

14:38.840 --> 14:45.560
He said, in terms of saturation, do newbies stand a chance against seasoned agencies?

14:45.560 --> 14:48.960
So let's just say, let's take Simon, for example.

14:48.960 --> 14:50.560
Simon just started doing this.

14:50.560 --> 14:52.240
I think he did.

14:52.240 --> 14:57.480
Does Simon have a chance to do this against somebody like myself who's been doing this

14:57.480 --> 15:01.520
since 2016 and been seriously doing this since 2020?

15:01.520 --> 15:02.520
That's the question.

15:02.520 --> 15:09.480
Well, the truth is, guys, is that it's the wrong question because this person's thinking

15:09.480 --> 15:11.560
about this in terms of a scarcity mindset.

15:11.560 --> 15:17.000
They're thinking about this in terms of if they get a deal, then it's taking one out

15:17.000 --> 15:20.440
of my pocket, or if I get a deal, it's taking one out of their pockets.

15:20.440 --> 15:23.320
It's a scarcity mindset, right?

15:24.320 --> 15:30.800
The success that Paul has, or the success that Craig has, has nothing to do with me.

15:30.800 --> 15:31.800
It doesn't affect me.

15:31.800 --> 15:33.600
It doesn't take money out of my pocket.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.520
That's something that people get confused.

15:35.520 --> 15:41.080
Just because Paul goes and lands a deal today does not take money out of my pocket.

15:41.080 --> 15:42.080
Here's a good example.

15:42.080 --> 15:47.880
My little brother, he just called me on Saturday and he was like, and by the way, for those

15:47.880 --> 15:52.120
of you in digital landlords, tomorrow we're going to be doing a post that's going to let

15:52.120 --> 15:53.120
you guys know this.

15:53.120 --> 16:00.160
We're going to be doing a really interesting live, a very value driven live on how to replace

16:00.160 --> 16:01.160
clients quickly.

16:01.160 --> 16:05.160
You get those clients, they're bad, sorry, how to replace bad clients quickly.

16:05.160 --> 16:08.560
He ended up finding out he had two bad clients and he's at 10.6.

16:08.560 --> 16:09.960
He's like, I don't want to go back.

16:09.960 --> 16:12.840
I want to replace them as soon as possible.

16:12.840 --> 16:16.400
He actually replaced two clients on Saturday back to back.

16:16.400 --> 16:18.800
He's going to be sharing those strategies.

16:18.800 --> 16:22.560
He called me and he told me this story and he's like, yeah, I landed these two clients.

16:23.000 --> 16:27.080
Guys, I didn't think in my head, oh, Porter got two more deals.

16:27.080 --> 16:29.520
That's two deals that I could have got.

16:29.520 --> 16:33.960
The question is flawed because just because this person gets a deal or just because Paul

16:33.960 --> 16:38.400
or Craig or Simon or anybody else in this call gets a deal does not take it out of my

16:38.400 --> 16:39.400
pocket.

16:39.400 --> 16:44.680
You got to be, guys, think about this and maybe I should answer the bigger question

16:44.680 --> 16:46.960
which is, is ranking rent saturated?

16:46.960 --> 16:49.480
That's the question that everybody's asked from the beginning.

16:49.480 --> 16:50.760
That's the question that I asked.

16:50.960 --> 16:52.560
Basically, the question is this, guys.

16:52.560 --> 16:57.960
The question I was asking when I first got started was, did I miss the opportunity?

16:57.960 --> 17:00.080
Should I have done this five years ago?

17:00.080 --> 17:01.680
The answer is, yeah, of course.

17:01.680 --> 17:05.280
It's like that old saying, when is the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago.

17:05.280 --> 17:07.440
That one's the best time today.

17:07.440 --> 17:11.440
Of course, I should have started five years before I even did.

17:11.440 --> 17:13.160
The best time to start is now.

17:13.160 --> 17:17.360
If you really think about the amount of businesses out there, if you think about the amount of

17:17.960 --> 17:26.240
Let's see how many new businesses start in, let's just say the US and the United States

17:26.240 --> 17:30.080
every year.

17:30.080 --> 17:32.360
There are four points on average.

17:32.360 --> 17:36.760
There are 4.7 million businesses started every year.

17:36.760 --> 17:43.880
So guys, and that's not even to mention all the new industries that are created.

17:43.880 --> 17:49.280
That's not even all like people that are saying this is saturated are looking at this from

17:49.280 --> 17:53.960
one niche and they're looking at it from one angle and they're saying, oh my gosh, everyone's

17:53.960 --> 17:55.560
talking about concrete.

17:55.560 --> 17:56.560
Okay.

17:56.560 --> 17:57.560
Yes.

17:57.560 --> 18:00.840
If you start looking for a concrete website, it is going to be more difficult to find a

18:00.840 --> 18:06.280
concrete website that's low hanging fruit than it was four years ago.

18:06.280 --> 18:07.280
Yes.

18:07.280 --> 18:12.400
But guys, you're also forgetting the fact that just because you go into a city and you

18:12.400 --> 18:17.240
see my website, that doesn't mean you can't come in there as well.

18:17.240 --> 18:18.240
Okay.

18:18.240 --> 18:22.920
There's so many levels to this, but to say that this business is saturated is ridiculous.

18:22.920 --> 18:24.280
It's still unknown.

18:24.280 --> 18:25.280
This business is still unknown.

18:25.280 --> 18:28.400
You still cannot go to somebody and say, hey, I'm in the ranking business and they know

18:28.400 --> 18:29.400
what you're talking about.

18:29.400 --> 18:31.200
They have no idea.

18:31.200 --> 18:34.120
And then once you tell them exactly what it is, they're like, oh, that's super smart.

18:34.120 --> 18:36.480
You're like, yeah, I build these simple websites.

18:36.480 --> 18:40.600
They cost me 80 bucks to build and I rank them and then I rent them out and get paid

18:40.600 --> 18:41.600
passively.

18:41.800 --> 18:42.880
And you're like, yeah, that's genius.

18:42.880 --> 18:44.720
I never hear anything besides that.

18:44.720 --> 18:45.720
That's genius.

18:45.720 --> 18:46.720
Okay.

18:46.720 --> 18:50.080
So it's not saturated.

18:50.080 --> 18:51.080
At least that's my opinion.

18:51.080 --> 18:53.200
And that's the opinion that I've always chosen to follow.

18:53.200 --> 18:56.120
And guys, it's served me very, very well.

18:56.120 --> 18:57.120
Okay.

18:57.120 --> 19:03.360
Paul says money and opportunity is limited by the way, Kevin said he updated his location.

19:03.360 --> 19:05.440
Paul says money and opportunity is unlimited.

19:05.440 --> 19:08.080
I'm doing concrete right now and see many opportunities.

19:08.080 --> 19:09.080
Yes.

19:09.560 --> 19:17.000
My brother Porter, he started like properly doing this business two years ago.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
Yeah.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
About two years ago.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
Okay.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.800
That kid has only done concrete.

19:21.800 --> 19:26.560
This is like a year, year after we started talking only about concrete.

19:26.560 --> 19:27.760
Everyone is doing concrete.

19:27.760 --> 19:29.300
Everyone's talking about concrete.

19:29.300 --> 19:31.840
He still is getting concrete deals.

19:31.840 --> 19:35.280
He's doing, I think he's does concrete and he does fencing and I think he's going to

19:35.280 --> 19:39.160
that's happened to masonry, okay.

19:39.160 --> 19:43.680
But all of his deals at $10,600 per month, all of his deals are in the same niches as

19:43.680 --> 19:44.680
everybody else's in.

19:44.680 --> 19:46.440
So don't, don't stress on that.

19:46.440 --> 19:47.440
Okay.

19:47.440 --> 19:53.440
Let me give you guys, I want to share something with you guys that I actually found out or

19:53.440 --> 19:55.400
that I, that I've been trying.

19:55.400 --> 20:03.400
So Francesca and I, if you didn't, if you're not following on YouTube, then that's fine.

20:03.400 --> 20:07.000
But you should because we're sharing a lot of stuff this year that's more of like stuff

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
that we're doing.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
Okay.

20:09.000 --> 20:13.920
And Francesca and I, as I've mentioned, our goal is to get to $10,000 per month with the

20:13.920 --> 20:16.560
agency of new business in the, in the first quarter.

20:16.560 --> 20:17.560
Okay.

20:17.560 --> 20:19.680
And when I say we, that means her, I'm not doing it.

20:19.680 --> 20:20.800
I'm not doing sales calls.

20:20.800 --> 20:21.800
I'm not doing anything.

20:21.800 --> 20:22.800
I'm just advising.

20:22.800 --> 20:23.800
I talked to her on Mondays.

20:23.800 --> 20:24.800
I talked to her on Wednesdays.

20:24.800 --> 20:26.560
I talked to her on Fridays about the business.

20:26.560 --> 20:27.560
That's it.

20:27.560 --> 20:28.560
Okay.

20:28.560 --> 20:29.560
30 minutes each.

20:29.560 --> 20:30.560
Sometimes it goes a little bit longer, sometimes a little bit shorter.

20:30.720 --> 20:34.720
I'm talking to her total about an hour to an hour and a half is what I'm advising her

20:34.720 --> 20:37.120
on how to run the agency.

20:37.120 --> 20:39.120
So we started looking at our goals.

20:39.120 --> 20:40.360
We reviewed our goals.

20:40.360 --> 20:41.360
Okay.

20:41.360 --> 20:46.240
And our, I was like, yeah, our goal is $10,000 per month by the end of quarter one.

20:46.240 --> 20:48.560
So this is about a week and a half ago.

20:48.560 --> 20:50.760
I'm like, Hey, what are we at?

20:50.760 --> 20:52.600
And she's like, we haven't gotten any deals yet.

20:52.600 --> 20:56.360
Now granted, I didn't set these goals until the beginning of February.

20:56.360 --> 20:59.840
So this is like two, three weeks into this, maybe even two weeks.

20:59.840 --> 21:00.840
And so we sat down.

21:00.840 --> 21:05.720
We had this whiteboard session in my office and just kind of strategize on what we can

21:05.720 --> 21:08.720
do to make sure that we get to 10 K.

21:08.720 --> 21:13.920
And we realized that if we're going to get to 10 K of not per month, because we're, we're

21:13.920 --> 21:19.240
way past 10 K per month, 10 K in new business in quarter one, then we're going to have to

21:19.240 --> 21:23.760
do some stuff that's scrappy, some stuff that's unconventional, some stuff that's not exactly

21:23.760 --> 21:25.480
the stuff that I'd be doing longterm.

21:25.480 --> 21:26.480
And so we had three columns.

21:26.480 --> 21:31.520
We had short term, medium term, long term was like, what can we actually do to hit the

21:31.520 --> 21:32.520
10 K?

21:32.520 --> 21:33.520
Okay.

21:33.520 --> 21:36.520
This was the conversation that we had.

21:36.520 --> 21:41.960
And we started coming up with ideas and, and a lot of those ideas guys were things that

21:41.960 --> 21:45.160
were not super scalable.

21:45.160 --> 21:48.120
They're not things that are something that you could do over and over and over again,

21:48.120 --> 21:49.560
but they are hustle things.

21:49.560 --> 21:50.560
Okay.

21:51.320 --> 21:57.480
One of the things that we did is we went and went, and this is the one strategy I want

21:57.480 --> 22:04.840
to give you guys is we went in and I have a, so if you either, either if you have websites

22:04.840 --> 22:09.400
that are generating a few leads that you want to sell, or if you've looked at a city and

22:09.400 --> 22:13.320
niche and it looks like a really good opportunity, you've done the due diligence, here's a little

22:13.320 --> 22:15.200
strategy that you may want to try.

22:15.200 --> 22:16.200
Okay.

22:17.040 --> 22:24.240
Is I went in with my profile and I went in and I found some strategic Facebook groups

22:24.240 --> 22:25.720
in inside, in Facebook.

22:25.720 --> 22:26.720
Okay.

22:26.720 --> 22:30.320
It's one of the Facebook groups and I went into these, these groups.

22:30.320 --> 22:32.040
One of them was a biz buy sell.

22:32.040 --> 22:33.040
Okay.

22:33.040 --> 22:37.640
And so whatever the city is, so let's say you're going into Roswell, New Mexico.

22:37.640 --> 22:38.640
Okay.

22:38.640 --> 22:44.560
You go to Roswell biz buy sell, you go to Roswell yard sale, online yard sale, whatever

22:44.640 --> 22:49.240
you go to these groups and you go and join these groups in these cities.

22:49.240 --> 22:50.240
Okay.

22:50.240 --> 22:57.640
Now, if you haven't made any posts or interactions in there, you may want to do just a few just

22:57.640 --> 23:00.760
to make it look like you're not brand new.

23:00.760 --> 23:04.560
But if this is in your hometown, then it makes it a little bit easier because you're probably

23:04.560 --> 23:05.840
going to have some mutual contact.

23:05.840 --> 23:07.680
So you're not going to look like you're a scam.

23:07.680 --> 23:13.320
So we went into these groups and we just wrote up this simple copy.

23:13.400 --> 23:15.000
And we made a quick post.

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
It wasn't big.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
It wasn't long.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.160
It didn't seem salesy.

23:18.160 --> 23:19.760
And it basically said something like this.

23:19.760 --> 23:26.160
It said, it said, Hey, does here, I'll actually read the text for you guys and I'll copy the

23:26.160 --> 23:27.160
post for you guys.

23:27.160 --> 23:28.440
And I'll, I'll drop it real quick.

23:28.440 --> 23:29.440
Hold on.

23:29.440 --> 23:32.880
Let me go and find the post real quick because we've already had some hits on this thing.

23:32.880 --> 23:36.800
And I think we're going to be able to, to have some sales calls based on this real quick.

23:36.800 --> 23:41.080
Let me just pull this up loading here.

23:41.080 --> 23:42.080
There it is.

23:42.080 --> 23:43.080
I put this on last night.

23:43.080 --> 23:44.080
All right.

23:44.080 --> 23:45.720
I'm going to copy this for you guys.

23:45.720 --> 23:47.520
I don't know if this will let me.

23:47.520 --> 23:48.520
All right.

23:48.520 --> 23:55.200
I don't know if it'll let me drop it, but here's what it says.

23:55.200 --> 23:57.520
Can anyone recommend a good blank?

23:57.520 --> 23:58.520
Okay.

23:58.520 --> 24:03.360
So whatever that is, can anyone recommend a good concrete company, a good fencing company?

24:03.360 --> 24:04.360
So that was it.

24:04.360 --> 24:06.400
Can anyone recommend a good blank?

24:06.400 --> 24:08.160
And then I put space.

24:08.160 --> 24:13.640
I put question mark space, preferably someone who is not super booked out, have two referrals

24:13.640 --> 24:14.960
that need work done.

24:14.960 --> 24:15.960
Okay.

24:15.960 --> 24:16.960
Simple little text.

24:16.960 --> 24:17.960
I didn't put in there.

24:17.960 --> 24:21.800
I generate leads and I've got a website and I need somebody to work with.

24:21.800 --> 24:25.440
I just put, can anyone recommend a good blank?

24:25.440 --> 24:29.440
Preferably someone who is not super booked out, have two referrals that need work done.

24:29.440 --> 24:30.440
Okay.

24:30.440 --> 24:32.200
I've already got eight comments on this thing.

24:32.200 --> 24:35.360
Um, somebody, somebody said, uh, they tagged somebody else.

24:35.360 --> 24:36.600
Hey, does Kenny have time?

24:36.600 --> 24:37.720
There's a referral.

24:37.720 --> 24:40.560
And by the way, this is somebody who's like not even advertising online.

24:40.560 --> 24:42.360
So I don't know if it's going to be the greatest.

24:42.360 --> 24:45.000
Then somebody else says, uh, do you have an excavator?

24:45.000 --> 24:47.440
And by the way, the niches excavation, do you have an excavator?

24:47.440 --> 24:49.400
Is this a full-time thing or a quick project?

24:49.400 --> 24:51.400
Probably not somebody I'm going to reach out to.

24:51.400 --> 24:55.760
Then I have somebody that, that reaches out and says this, he says, we, and this guy actually

24:55.760 --> 24:56.880
knows who I am.

24:56.880 --> 24:58.960
He goes, we could do trade.

24:58.960 --> 25:03.440
I need help with my websites and I want, I want to build two more.

25:03.440 --> 25:06.480
So I don't know what this guy's referring to.

25:06.480 --> 25:12.080
If he, so if he's got, uh, you know, he does the comment before says he has an excavator.

25:12.080 --> 25:13.080
Okay.

25:13.080 --> 25:14.920
So now I have somebody I can talk to.

25:14.920 --> 25:15.920
Then I have another one.

25:15.920 --> 25:20.720
It guy just barely comment and says, we're at, we do excavation work and he tags his

25:20.720 --> 25:25.640
own business, which by the way, I believe is also in the same city.

25:25.640 --> 25:26.640
Okay.

25:26.640 --> 25:30.600
So right there, I just got two people that now reached out to me that want work that

25:30.600 --> 25:32.080
made their comment.

25:32.080 --> 25:34.720
And I have two, two warm prospects to reach out to.

25:34.840 --> 25:35.840
Okay.

25:35.840 --> 25:43.200
If I can drop this, um, let's see if I can drop a picture here, where's that?

25:43.200 --> 25:44.200
Hold on.

25:44.200 --> 25:45.200
I don't know if I can file.

25:45.200 --> 25:46.200
Okay.

25:46.200 --> 25:49.840
I'll try to draw what I'll try to do, guys.

25:49.840 --> 25:52.840
I'll try to drop it in the, uh, as a comment or something.

25:52.840 --> 25:54.800
Let me add Carlo into here, by the way.

25:54.800 --> 26:00.120
So anyway, guys, just a super easy, quick strategy that you guys can use to find warm

26:00.120 --> 26:01.120
prospects.

26:01.520 --> 26:06.800
It always helps if you're, you know, let's, this would be good guys in the situation where

26:06.800 --> 26:10.840
you've tried, you build a list, you tried to cold call, didn't have any luck and you're

26:10.840 --> 26:15.000
just looking for more people that would work, um, where you're already getting leads.

26:15.000 --> 26:19.160
It would work in a situation where you already have a website and it's getting a few leads,

26:19.160 --> 26:20.560
but you haven't sold it yet.

26:20.560 --> 26:23.720
It could work in a situation where you've just found the city and found the niche and

26:23.720 --> 26:26.600
you're running the ads and you're waiting for the ads to kick in.

26:26.600 --> 26:31.080
You could also do that strategy, but guys, it's, it's been like, I made that post

26:31.240 --> 26:32.240
on Friday.

26:32.240 --> 26:36.640
That's all that I did is made that simple little post and we've already gotten two feedback

26:36.640 --> 26:37.640
or two hits.

26:37.640 --> 26:38.640
Okay.

26:38.640 --> 26:44.000
So, um, according to this says Paul says we use a very similar strategy and crush it.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
So there you go.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.520
That was just a little, little thing that I tried and it worked really well.

26:47.520 --> 26:52.040
We've got a bunch of different things we're going to be trying guys back to the book that

26:52.040 --> 26:54.760
I recommended back to the slide edge.

26:54.760 --> 26:58.480
It's all these little things that you're doing, all these little things, these little places

26:58.480 --> 27:00.000
that you're letting people know what you do.

27:00.000 --> 27:04.920
All the, yeah, I know it's not sustainable necessarily to do, uh, a hundred different

27:04.920 --> 27:09.640
posts all over the place, but guys, all the little things that you're doing, all the conversations

27:09.640 --> 27:12.520
that you're having, that person that you told that the gym that you do lead generation,

27:12.520 --> 27:16.340
the person that you're sitting in the sauna with to ask what you do, um, these things

27:16.340 --> 27:20.800
all add up and, uh, yeah, they're there.

27:20.800 --> 27:24.580
At some point you start to realize, Hey, that guy I talked to like two months ago, he hit

27:24.580 --> 27:27.640
me back up and he's, he's ready to, to work with me.

27:27.640 --> 27:28.640
Okay.

27:28.640 --> 27:29.640
All right, let's keep going.

27:30.280 --> 27:37.160
All right, let's see.

27:37.160 --> 27:38.160
Here's another one.

27:38.160 --> 27:40.600
This is not something that's a question, but it kind of is a question.

27:40.600 --> 27:46.920
So, uh, somebody said this, I had this, again, I made this video that said how the game has

27:46.920 --> 27:52.060
changed and this person made kind of a snarky comment and said, yes, if you constantly focus

27:52.060 --> 27:53.060
on SEO.

27:53.060 --> 27:54.060
Okay.

27:54.060 --> 27:55.060
And they're making this, this thing.

27:55.060 --> 27:57.480
So really the question is like, can you do this business?

27:58.320 --> 28:02.800
I guess the question, if I were to phrase it, would be that they're asking is like,

28:02.800 --> 28:07.120
how much SEO, how much ongoing SEO do you need to do on these websites to keep them

28:07.120 --> 28:08.120
ranked?

28:08.120 --> 28:09.120
Okay.

28:09.120 --> 28:10.120
Guys, um, not much.

28:10.120 --> 28:12.920
I'm going to show you a couple of examples here.

28:12.920 --> 28:13.920
Okay.

28:13.920 --> 28:14.920
Here's my YouTube comments.

28:14.920 --> 28:15.920
I'm looking at, by the way.

28:15.920 --> 28:16.920
Okay.

28:16.920 --> 28:19.520
So let's go like this.

28:19.520 --> 28:25.360
So I'm going to give you an example of, uh, I love this example because it's such a, such

28:25.360 --> 28:27.960
a great site that I love Bentonville concrete.

28:27.960 --> 28:29.560
You guys have heard me use this example.

28:29.560 --> 28:32.320
This is my site right here, Bentonville concrete.com.

28:32.320 --> 28:34.240
You can say, I just want to show you how well it's ranked.

28:34.240 --> 28:35.240
So I'm ranked here.

28:35.240 --> 28:36.240
Let me see if you guys can actually see it.

28:36.240 --> 28:37.240
Zoom in a little bit.

28:37.240 --> 28:39.600
This is my site here, Bentonville concrete.

28:39.600 --> 28:44.440
This is my, um, math listing, Bentonville concrete.

28:44.440 --> 28:48.740
This is my Facebook page, Bentonville concrete is ranked.

28:48.740 --> 28:51.120
So my page is ranked number one.

28:51.120 --> 28:57.440
My map is ranked number one and my Facebook page is ranked number two.

28:57.440 --> 28:58.440
Okay.

28:58.440 --> 28:59.440
Keep going.

28:59.440 --> 29:04.360
I don't know if I have any more listings on page one, but I, I have two of the top, well

29:04.360 --> 29:06.880
technically in the organic listings.

29:06.880 --> 29:07.880
Let's go like this.

29:07.880 --> 29:14.320
Let's change this around a little bit and put concrete contractors Bentonville AR.

29:14.320 --> 29:16.000
Okay.

29:16.000 --> 29:23.840
Ranked number two and then I'm ranked number one and I'm ranked number two.

29:23.840 --> 29:25.260
And that's not even my Facebook page either.

29:25.260 --> 29:30.200
So I've got the two top spots in the organic and the second spot in the map pack.

29:30.200 --> 29:37.380
Why do I tell you this, friends, I have not logged into this website.

29:37.380 --> 29:38.380
God is my witness.

29:38.380 --> 29:43.040
I'll, I'll, I'll triple check with Francesca, but God is my witness personally.

29:43.040 --> 29:44.040
I have not logged.

29:44.040 --> 29:45.600
I don't even know how to log into the website.

29:45.600 --> 29:48.240
I'm sure that I have the password saved.

29:48.240 --> 29:53.200
It's been two to three years, two to three years since I've logged on the website.

29:53.200 --> 29:57.320
The only thing that we've been doing is the business owner has taken some accountability.

29:57.320 --> 29:59.280
He's helping us to get reviews.

29:59.280 --> 30:00.280
That's it.

30:00.280 --> 30:01.880
We have not logged into the website.

30:01.880 --> 30:06.480
In fact, the business owner came to us recently and said to us, Hey, we want, I would love

30:06.480 --> 30:10.320
to add this and that he printed off.

30:10.320 --> 30:11.720
He went and he printed off all the content.

30:11.720 --> 30:14.480
He highlighted the stuff that he wanted to remove.

30:14.480 --> 30:17.080
And in fact, I'm going to message him after this because I think I can squeeze in for

30:17.080 --> 30:18.080
another deal.

30:18.080 --> 30:24.120
Um, so we were talking about doing something and I'm going to, I'm going to mention this

30:24.120 --> 30:25.120
here in a second.

30:25.120 --> 30:27.240
Anyway, guys, he's like, Hey, can we change this?

30:27.240 --> 30:28.240
Can we change this?

30:28.240 --> 30:32.400
And I told him, I said, look, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.

30:32.400 --> 30:33.400
Okay.

30:33.400 --> 30:35.040
So I'm not touching the site.

30:35.040 --> 30:36.960
This thing is ranking like a champ.

30:36.960 --> 30:38.280
It's glued to the top.

30:38.280 --> 30:39.280
Now, why?

30:39.760 --> 30:42.480
Well, because I did a really good due diligence.

30:42.480 --> 30:43.640
I caught this website.

30:43.640 --> 30:49.080
I built this website the perfect time before the, the, well, probably around the same time,

30:49.080 --> 30:50.760
but I knew business was booming.

30:50.760 --> 30:51.760
I used to live in Bentonville.

30:51.760 --> 30:53.520
I used to do door to door sales in Bentonville.

30:53.520 --> 30:54.760
I saw the houses going up.

30:54.760 --> 30:55.880
I saw the economy.

30:55.880 --> 30:57.480
I saw the cars people drove.

30:57.480 --> 31:02.120
I knew that Walmart had a policy they were implementing where if you worked, if you sold

31:02.120 --> 31:06.280
products to Walmart, you had to have an office in Bentonville, Arkansas.

31:06.280 --> 31:07.280
I knew all these things.

31:07.280 --> 31:09.360
I knew there was also JB Hunt.

31:09.360 --> 31:11.280
I knew Tyson Chicken was there.

31:11.280 --> 31:14.880
I had all this Intel because I lived there and I just made this bet.

31:14.880 --> 31:17.920
And I did the research back, guys, back in the day when I built Bentonville concrete,

31:17.920 --> 31:21.160
when you looked at the search volume, there was not much.

31:21.160 --> 31:22.560
It was, it was a, it was a risk.

31:22.560 --> 31:25.760
I built this thing as a risk and I ranked this website quick.

31:25.760 --> 31:28.200
It was like two, three months because no one was trying to rank.

31:28.200 --> 31:29.200
There was no competition.

31:29.200 --> 31:30.200
Right?

31:30.200 --> 31:34.840
So I built this website and it ranks, but because I did such good due diligence, guys,

31:34.840 --> 31:37.600
this thing is glued to the top.

31:37.600 --> 31:41.240
So the reason I'm telling you this is this person that's like telling me, yeah, unless

31:41.240 --> 31:44.560
you focus on SEO, no, you don't have to focus on SEO.

31:44.560 --> 31:45.800
You have to do, do good due diligence.

31:45.800 --> 31:48.480
You have to know what to look for in a city and niche.

31:48.480 --> 31:52.040
And then it's glued to the top and there's not much upkeep.

31:52.040 --> 31:53.040
That's one website.

31:53.040 --> 31:54.040
Okay.

31:54.040 --> 31:55.440
I'll give you one more.

31:55.440 --> 32:04.760
This one right here I built in St. George, towing St. George, Utah, okay.

32:05.680 --> 32:07.240
Right here, towingstgeorge.com.

32:07.240 --> 32:09.320
Rank number one, towingstgeorge.com.

32:09.320 --> 32:10.320
Rank number two.

32:10.320 --> 32:11.320
Okay.

32:11.320 --> 32:17.840
See another, I, by the way, I tell you this.

32:17.840 --> 32:19.320
I haven't logged into this website.

32:19.320 --> 32:23.480
Look at this website guys.

32:23.480 --> 32:24.480
It's hideous.

32:24.480 --> 32:25.560
I haven't logged into this.

32:25.560 --> 32:28.000
I think we, we sold this in 2020.

32:28.000 --> 32:31.040
We have not added content.

32:31.040 --> 32:33.100
We have not added backlinks.

32:33.100 --> 32:34.900
We have not done anything in five years.

32:34.900 --> 32:35.900
This thing's glued to the top.

32:35.900 --> 32:37.980
It's making us like five, 600 bucks per month.

32:37.980 --> 32:39.940
Not, not anything crazy on autopilot.

32:39.940 --> 32:40.940
Okay.

32:40.940 --> 32:41.940
I don't even think we run ads.

32:41.940 --> 32:42.940
Let me double check here.

32:42.940 --> 32:43.940
Let me go back.

32:43.940 --> 32:44.940
Maybe we run a little bit.

32:44.940 --> 32:45.940
I don't even think we run ads.

32:45.940 --> 32:46.940
No, I don't think so.

32:46.940 --> 32:49.700
I don't think we run any ads at all.

32:49.700 --> 32:50.700
Okay.

32:50.700 --> 32:56.220
So anyway, you do not, if the key is not the SEO, the key is doing the, the, the, the due

32:56.220 --> 32:57.220
diligence.

32:57.220 --> 33:01.940
So guys, for those of you that are in digital landlords, go follow the due diligence process

33:02.060 --> 33:04.100
to a freaking tee.

33:04.100 --> 33:07.160
Everything that I tell you to do, if it says that the CPC needs to be, make sure it says

33:07.160 --> 33:10.340
if it says that you need to look for this sign, this sign before you go into it, do

33:10.340 --> 33:11.340
that.

33:11.340 --> 33:14.940
If, if this, if I tell you that the search volume needs to be the minimum of this, go

33:14.940 --> 33:15.940
and do it.

33:15.940 --> 33:20.320
If you do these, even if you got to look at a hundred of these things, guys, it's going

33:20.320 --> 33:21.320
to be worth it.

33:21.320 --> 33:24.300
If you don't have to look at a hundred cities and niches to find one, it's going to be worth

33:24.300 --> 33:25.300
it.

33:25.300 --> 33:26.300
Okay.

33:26.300 --> 33:27.300
Because it's going to, you're going to have projects like this.

33:27.300 --> 33:29.960
You're going to build five years later, no upkeep, no nothing.

33:29.980 --> 33:33.120
You're making 600 bucks a month and it's still paying you every single month.

33:33.120 --> 33:34.120
Okay.

33:34.120 --> 33:37.240
And luckily with rank and rent engine, you guys are not using that.

33:37.240 --> 33:41.480
I, you don't have to, but it's made due diligence so freaking fast.

33:41.480 --> 33:46.480
You can go bust out 20 due diligence in an hour, maybe a little bit less than that.

33:46.480 --> 33:47.600
And you can go look at 20 cities.

33:47.600 --> 33:49.240
So in one day you could have a VA.

33:49.240 --> 33:52.560
Once you train them, you can have a VA look at a hundred cities in a day, right?

33:52.560 --> 33:55.320
You look at a hundred cities in a day for five days, you go look at 500 cities, you

33:55.320 --> 33:57.380
find five projects to go into.

33:57.380 --> 33:58.720
You can do some real damage guys.

33:58.720 --> 34:01.560
So anyway, if you aren't using that already, go to the rankandrentengine.com.

34:01.560 --> 34:04.280
The due diligence tool is freaking amazing.

34:04.280 --> 34:05.280
Okay.

34:05.280 --> 34:06.280
Let's keep going.

34:06.280 --> 34:07.280
See if anyone has any other questions.

34:07.280 --> 34:10.000
We should stop the share here.

34:10.000 --> 34:11.720
All right.

34:11.720 --> 34:12.720
Let's see.

34:12.720 --> 34:13.720
What else we got?

34:13.720 --> 34:16.720
Let me make a note here.

34:16.720 --> 34:24.480
Sometimes I'll be talking and I have thoughts that I want to just make sure I don't forget.

34:24.480 --> 34:25.480
Okay.

34:25.480 --> 34:26.480
What else we got?

34:26.480 --> 34:39.880
I'm not sure what that question is.

34:39.880 --> 34:44.200
That's in the spam.

34:44.200 --> 34:45.200
What else?

34:45.200 --> 34:46.200
What else?

34:46.200 --> 34:47.200
What else?

34:47.200 --> 34:48.200
Okay.

34:48.200 --> 34:52.760
Somebody said, yo, I'm 23 year old Russian American.

34:52.760 --> 34:56.600
Let me know if you want to work together.

34:56.600 --> 34:59.920
That's not really a question, but one thing I'll say is that I don't care where you're

34:59.920 --> 35:00.920
at.

35:00.920 --> 35:02.320
You guys can make this strategy work.

35:02.320 --> 35:07.040
I just did an interview with a guy named Pierre, Pierre Goddard.

35:07.040 --> 35:10.040
Some of you guys might know him from some of the other groups that you guys are in.

35:10.040 --> 35:11.800
This guy is in France.

35:11.800 --> 35:12.800
Sorry.

35:12.800 --> 35:17.960
He's from France, French accent, living in Thailand and he's targeting France.

35:17.960 --> 35:23.680
He's making a little over $12,000 per month and he's exclusively targeting France.

35:23.680 --> 35:24.680
Okay.

35:24.680 --> 35:26.040
If you're in Russia, you can target Russia.

35:26.040 --> 35:29.560
If you're in freaking wherever, you can target wherever.

35:29.560 --> 35:33.080
If people search the same way that we do in the U.S., okay.

35:33.080 --> 35:35.580
There's a lot of interesting countries that I'm looking at.

35:35.580 --> 35:37.680
So that's just a quick thought, guys.

35:37.680 --> 35:42.960
If you're in a country besides the U.S., you want to target your country, you should, okay.

35:42.960 --> 35:43.960
Let's see.

35:43.960 --> 35:55.040
Here in terms of questions, I think we pretty much hit it.

35:55.040 --> 35:59.160
Somebody right here just dropping three spam comments.

35:59.160 --> 36:01.160
That's good.

36:01.160 --> 36:04.760
Okay.

36:04.760 --> 36:08.560
Let's go to, yeah, pretty much everything's spam there.

36:08.560 --> 36:09.560
All right.

36:09.560 --> 36:13.200
If anyone has, doesn't have questions, I'll keep going.

36:13.200 --> 36:20.960
Paul, he says, is there any keyword campaigns available for PPC for concrete?

36:20.960 --> 36:23.440
Quick follow up question to that, Paul, just drop in the comments.

36:23.440 --> 36:28.520
Are you talking about like a keyword list or what do you mean by a keyword campaign?

36:28.520 --> 36:35.320
If you don't mind, just clarify that really quick while I jump into the Facebook group

36:35.320 --> 36:38.720
and answer some questions that people had.

36:38.720 --> 36:39.720
Okay.

36:39.720 --> 36:45.840
Let's go here.

36:45.840 --> 36:56.240
All right.

36:56.240 --> 36:57.240
I got one right there.

36:57.240 --> 36:58.240
Let me just clarify, Paul.

36:58.240 --> 37:03.240
Paul, when you can, just clarify what you're talking about when you say, is there any keywords

37:03.240 --> 37:05.240
campaigns available for PPC?

37:05.240 --> 37:06.240
Okay.

37:06.240 --> 37:07.880
All right.

37:08.440 --> 37:12.680
While that's happening, guys, here's a question by Tim Johnson.

37:12.680 --> 37:21.120
He says, I've used Pakistan guys for GMB before and had luck on $300 ones, but dude's Facebook

37:21.120 --> 37:23.080
profile disappeared.

37:23.080 --> 37:26.480
Anyone have a reliable source for done for you GMBs verified?

37:26.480 --> 37:34.920
Guys, I'm not a fan of messing with the GMB, especially with outsourced Pakistanis.

37:34.920 --> 37:35.920
Okay.

37:35.960 --> 37:42.800
I'm all about doing the GMB the right way, the white hat way, the clean way, using the

37:42.800 --> 37:45.200
business owner.

37:45.200 --> 37:50.080
Like for example, we have a business owner here in town and he actually has come to the

37:50.080 --> 37:53.920
office with his truck, with his business cards, with his stuff.

37:53.920 --> 37:58.120
And we've done a video call with him at the office with Google.

37:58.120 --> 37:59.120
Okay.

37:59.120 --> 38:00.120
I got no problems with that.

38:00.120 --> 38:01.600
I'm not doing fake reviews.

38:01.720 --> 38:05.840
I'm not doing Pakistani freaking people, whatever.

38:05.840 --> 38:11.240
And by the way, there's no, there's no, like, I'm not talking smack because this is something

38:11.240 --> 38:12.600
that lots of people do.

38:12.600 --> 38:13.600
Lots of people like to do.

38:13.600 --> 38:17.120
I'm talking for me personally, guys, I'm trying to build an empire here.

38:17.120 --> 38:20.800
I'm trying to build a business that if something happens to me, God forbid, I can leave it

38:20.800 --> 38:21.800
to my kids.

38:21.800 --> 38:27.040
I'm trying to build something that I can, I can, that we can have around for years and

38:27.280 --> 38:29.800
years that can continue to produce cash.

38:29.800 --> 38:32.120
And I'm not just going to take shortcuts.

38:32.120 --> 38:33.120
Okay.

38:33.120 --> 38:34.920
I'm going to do it the right way.

38:34.920 --> 38:38.120
So I don't do this stuff.

38:38.120 --> 38:42.200
So in terms of like do it done for you, GMB, I just don't mess with it.

38:42.200 --> 38:43.200
Okay.

38:43.200 --> 38:50.960
There was somebody that did recommend a, somebody that did recommend a source, but the guy that

38:50.960 --> 38:54.320
recommended it, I don't trust greatly.

38:54.320 --> 38:57.240
So I'm not really sure I would recommend that either.

38:57.240 --> 38:58.240
Okay.

38:58.240 --> 39:02.920
All right.

39:02.920 --> 39:07.480
Paul says, basically any working campaigns that I've been, that have been run for a while

39:07.480 --> 39:13.420
and optimized to save my time, Paul, if you want to reach out to Francesca, this is something

39:13.420 --> 39:17.800
because you're in digital landlords, I got no problem helping you out extra.

39:17.800 --> 39:24.120
If you want to reach out and do this for me, send me and Francesca a Facebook message.

39:24.120 --> 39:27.400
Wait until I get off the stream so I can respond, explain what you're looking for.

39:27.400 --> 39:30.940
I'll put a voice note out that says, Hey, here's what he's trying to do.

39:30.940 --> 39:34.840
And I'll tell her, you know, sometimes Francesca, she goes, she's like, can you not tell people

39:34.840 --> 39:36.120
about all of our websites?

39:36.120 --> 39:39.700
Because she kind of has a little bit of a scarcity mentality sometimes.

39:39.700 --> 39:41.240
And I'm like, no, it doesn't matter.

39:41.240 --> 39:46.720
So anyway, she might want to just screenshot it and just send you a certain parts of it.

39:46.720 --> 39:52.120
But anyway, Paul, message both of us and we'll try to get you something if possible.

39:52.120 --> 39:53.120
Okay.

39:53.120 --> 39:54.120
Apology.

39:54.120 --> 39:59.560
Simon says, apologies, can't see an update to Community World Map.

39:59.560 --> 40:06.440
Simon, just grab your, okay, if it's not working, what I would like you to do is once we get

40:06.440 --> 40:10.640
off this call, make a quick little loom and show me what you're trying to do.

40:10.640 --> 40:12.200
And I'll try to figure out why it's not working.

40:12.200 --> 40:16.640
But you should be able to just grab your username, copy and paste it, plug it in, and you should

40:16.640 --> 40:17.640
be good to go.

40:17.640 --> 40:18.640
Okay.

40:18.640 --> 40:19.640
If not, just send me a loom and I'll look into it.

40:19.640 --> 40:20.640
I'll have Ashley look into it.

40:20.640 --> 40:21.640
Okay.

40:21.640 --> 40:26.240
Paul says, there is a lot of scammers out there right now for GMB.

40:26.240 --> 40:27.240
Tread with caution.

40:27.240 --> 40:28.240
Do not pay upfront.

40:28.240 --> 40:29.240
A thousand percent.

40:29.240 --> 40:30.240
GMBs are just spending like crazy.

40:30.240 --> 40:31.240
I lost any properties.

40:31.240 --> 40:32.240
That's why I'm shipping.

40:32.240 --> 40:33.240
Yeah.

40:33.240 --> 40:34.240
That's a great point.

40:34.240 --> 40:35.240
I forgot Paul.

40:35.240 --> 40:37.960
Paul had a huge stake in the GMB stuff and here we are.

40:37.960 --> 40:39.960
So anyway, Paul, great feedback.

40:39.960 --> 40:40.960
Crank head to bounce.

40:40.960 --> 40:41.960
Okay.

40:41.960 --> 40:42.960
Let me answer like one or two more questions.

40:42.960 --> 40:46.240
But again, Simon send me loom and we will, I'll get it.

40:46.240 --> 40:47.240
I'll check it out.

40:47.240 --> 40:48.240
Okay.

40:48.240 --> 40:50.240
Let's see what else we got here.

40:50.240 --> 41:06.640
I mean, there's not a ton of questions, which is great.

41:06.640 --> 41:15.040
Yeah.

41:15.040 --> 41:16.920
Somebody put this, I'll answer this one really quick.

41:16.920 --> 41:23.220
Somebody said, does anyone do this under an LLC, blah, blah, blah, blah, okay.

41:23.220 --> 41:28.240
Some people want to know if you need to have like an LLC set up for each of these individual

41:28.240 --> 41:34.960
properties or maybe let's say you have your, your actual LLC and then you have a DBA, right?

41:34.960 --> 41:36.760
So you have your main company.

41:36.760 --> 41:41.260
My company's called Evergreen and then I could go and have my attorney or my accountant set

41:41.260 --> 41:46.020
it up and have it like Evergreen leads LLC or I think it's actually called Evergreen

41:46.020 --> 41:52.100
Enterprises, the legal name Evergreen, Evergreen leads LLC DBA Bentonville concrete and I could

41:52.100 --> 41:58.580
actually go set up a DBA for each one of these websites.

41:58.580 --> 41:59.580
Do you need to do that?

41:59.580 --> 42:01.780
I don't think it's necessary.

42:01.780 --> 42:02.900
Some people do like to do it.

42:02.900 --> 42:08.460
I think sometimes it will help with the GMB and these kinds of things, but I'm asking,

42:08.460 --> 42:11.580
I'm saying this because somebody was asking about LLC and I don't know if that's exactly

42:11.580 --> 42:14.940
the question they were asking, but you don't have to do this guys.

42:14.940 --> 42:19.140
If you're looking to take extra precautions, then I think I went and worked this out with

42:19.140 --> 42:22.060
my attorney when I was asking him and he's like, yeah, we can work out a deal where anytime

42:22.060 --> 42:24.620
you had a new site, I would just do a DBA for you.

42:24.620 --> 42:28.260
It costs you this much money and then it would be checked off and it would be done.

42:28.260 --> 42:32.580
So that's something that you could do guys, but again, I think sometimes people overthink

42:32.580 --> 42:33.580
this.

42:33.580 --> 42:36.180
I've never had to do a DBA on any of my websites.

42:36.180 --> 42:40.260
Only thing that I would make sure to put is a privacy policy, put a terms of service page

42:40.260 --> 42:42.820
into your website.

42:43.260 --> 42:46.460
Other than that, that's really it.

42:46.460 --> 42:51.620
The easier thing to do to be cautious is in the bottom of the footer, make some kind of

42:51.620 --> 42:59.680
note that says like, this is a third party company that sends business to Joe's concrete

42:59.680 --> 43:04.620
and we do not actually do the work, whatever verbiage that sounds better than that.

43:04.620 --> 43:09.300
You could actually take their licensing number and paste it in the footer to really save

43:09.300 --> 43:11.780
your butt if you're concerned about that.

43:11.860 --> 43:13.220
I've never had any issues.

43:13.220 --> 43:14.220
I wouldn't worry about that.

43:14.220 --> 43:16.740
It's not a huge deal, okay?

43:16.740 --> 43:20.900
So that said guys, again, Paul messaged me and Francesca.

43:20.900 --> 43:22.700
I'll try to help you out.

43:22.700 --> 43:23.940
Simon sent me a loom.

43:23.940 --> 43:27.460
I'll also try to look at that as well.

43:27.460 --> 43:30.460
And guys, it's February 24th.

43:30.460 --> 43:31.460
Let's get at it.

43:31.460 --> 43:34.740
This last week that just passed, we got a little tiny deal.

43:34.740 --> 43:39.700
You guys probably saw Francesca's post, 300 bucks a month, nothing to write home about,

43:39.700 --> 43:40.700
nothing crazy.

43:41.180 --> 43:45.660
300 bucks a month times 12 is $3,600 a year.

43:45.660 --> 43:47.780
That ain't something I'm going to turn away.

43:47.780 --> 43:48.780
And guess what?

43:48.780 --> 43:51.380
Every single one of those $300 adds up.

43:51.380 --> 43:53.860
$300 here, by the way, that's pure profit.

43:53.860 --> 43:58.380
That's pure profit because that's a website that we had a client for, we lost a client

43:58.380 --> 43:59.380
for.

43:59.380 --> 44:00.740
It never was ranking super well.

44:00.740 --> 44:01.740
We haven't really focused on it.

44:01.740 --> 44:03.100
It was just generating a few leads.

44:03.100 --> 44:06.620
So now we're making 300 bucks that we weren't making, okay?

44:06.620 --> 44:07.620
Every deal counts.

44:07.620 --> 44:08.740
Every phone call counts.

44:08.740 --> 44:12.180
Everything that you do adds up, okay?

44:12.180 --> 44:13.180
Go read the slide edge.

44:13.180 --> 44:16.540
Simon, I would highly recommend you read chapter 13 and if you have any questions, reach out

44:16.540 --> 44:17.540
to me.

44:17.540 --> 44:22.340
But guys, with that said, guys, don't be afraid in my business right now.

44:22.340 --> 44:24.580
I'm not afraid to do things that are unscalable.

44:24.580 --> 44:26.940
I'm not afraid to reach out to somebody.

44:26.940 --> 44:29.840
Like for example, I'll give you one last thing as I go.

44:29.840 --> 44:35.300
We had this person that we got on the phone with on a sales call on Saturday, okay?

44:35.340 --> 44:37.780
And yes, we run Saturday calls because why not?

44:37.780 --> 44:41.660
Why not start the day, why not start the weekend with some new money?

44:41.660 --> 44:45.140
So we had this guy, we jumped on and we didn't close him.

44:45.140 --> 44:46.300
I didn't stay on the whole time.

44:46.300 --> 44:49.340
I just jumped off for a second just to make myself known.

44:49.340 --> 44:51.340
He didn't close.

44:51.340 --> 44:59.380
And after I got his number and I text him and I sent him a few texts, I sent him a two

44:59.380 --> 45:03.420
and a half minute voice note and throughout the day yesterday I was texting this guy back

45:03.460 --> 45:05.460
and forth, okay?

45:05.460 --> 45:08.300
Is this something I could do with every single deal?

45:08.300 --> 45:11.860
I have salespeople, that's their job, whatever, whatever, whatever.

45:11.860 --> 45:12.860
Should I be doing it?

45:12.860 --> 45:14.580
You could argue, no, I shouldn't be doing it.

45:14.580 --> 45:16.460
Some people probably would tell me I'm stupid.

45:16.460 --> 45:17.580
I am hungry, man.

45:17.580 --> 45:18.580
I want the deals.

45:18.580 --> 45:19.580
I'm willing to do it.

45:19.580 --> 45:23.740
I'm willing on a Sunday to message the guy and just say, hey, I know it's Sunday, I don't

45:23.740 --> 45:24.740
work on Sunday.

45:24.740 --> 45:29.860
I just want to send you a message and say this, that, and this, that, and the rest.

45:29.860 --> 45:32.980
I would love to, whatever, let's talk again on Monday.

45:32.980 --> 45:35.460
I've got some ideas and the guy agreed.

45:35.460 --> 45:37.580
The guy messaged back, hey, thanks for the text, Nick.

45:37.580 --> 45:38.580
I really appreciate it.

45:38.580 --> 45:41.940
I could see how much you actually care about your business and I would love to jump back

45:41.940 --> 45:46.300
on a Zoom call on Monday and see what you're talking about and we're going to come to this

45:46.300 --> 45:50.100
guy with some different options than what we gave him and see if we can close the deal.

45:50.100 --> 45:51.140
Is it practical?

45:51.140 --> 45:52.660
Is it scalable?

45:52.660 --> 45:53.660
Probably not, okay?

45:53.660 --> 45:57.660
To do that with every single client, especially as you scale, probably not, but guys, do unscalable

45:57.660 --> 45:59.340
things to pick up the momentum.

45:59.340 --> 46:00.620
You guys just got to get that first deal.

46:00.620 --> 46:01.620
You got to get that second deal.

46:01.620 --> 46:04.820
If it's been a while since you got a deal, go do whatever you got to do to get that deal.

46:04.820 --> 46:07.940
Go make the Facebook post that's going to get you that inbound warm lead.

46:07.940 --> 46:11.340
Be willing to go grab lunch with somebody, again, not every time.

46:11.340 --> 46:16.300
It shouldn't be part of your ongoing process, but guys, be willing to do unconventional,

46:16.300 --> 46:19.060
unscalable things to scale, okay?

46:19.060 --> 46:20.060
That's how you scale.

46:20.060 --> 46:22.460
That's how you pick up momentum is you do those things, those hustle deals.

46:22.460 --> 46:25.420
Guys, 2025, that's what I'm all about, is getting those hustle deals and getting back

46:25.420 --> 46:30.380
to the freaking, the nitty gritty basics and I hope you guys will too.

46:30.380 --> 46:31.380
So guys, appreciate you being on this call.

46:32.140 --> 46:35.420
I'm going to upload this, the replay, here in the next few minutes and I will see you

46:35.420 --> 46:36.420
guys next week.

46:36.420 --> 46:38.980
Guys, bring your questions, anything at all that you've got.

46:38.980 --> 46:46.180
Maybe next week we'll have a topic specific Q&A and we will see you guys in a week.

46:46.180 --> 46:46.740
Thanks, guys.
