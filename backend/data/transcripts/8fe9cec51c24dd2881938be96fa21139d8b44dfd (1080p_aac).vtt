make sure that you take care of the people that are on your team.

00:05.360 --> 00:08.960
Okay, make sure that you take care of the people that are on your team.

00:08.960 --> 00:11.680
And I'm telling you right now, if the business owners that you work with,

00:11.680 --> 00:16.320
you don't care about them, that the people that are on your team are going to notice

00:16.320 --> 00:19.520
and they're going to think in their head, you know what, if he's treating the business owner

00:19.520 --> 00:25.760
like that, you know, he can't possibly care about me. And they're probably right.

00:25.760 --> 00:28.240
Okay. But just remember that at the end of the day,

00:29.040 --> 00:32.480
you are not going to be able to scale this business without people on your team.

00:33.840 --> 00:38.080
You may be able to get to 10,000, you may be able to scrap your way to 15, 17,

00:38.080 --> 00:42.880
$20,000 per month, and you're going to be running around like crazy, doing it all yourself.

00:43.680 --> 00:47.680
But if you truly want to scale, if you want to make big boy money, big girl money,

00:47.680 --> 00:51.920
20, you know, 50,000, 70,000, a hundred thousand dollars a month, a million dollars a year,

00:52.560 --> 00:56.880
you have to have a team. Okay. I don't care how much work you're willing to put in. I don't care

00:56.880 --> 01:00.960
how much hustle, how much sweat, which I think you're stupid to be able to do that. I would

01:00.960 --> 01:07.680
much rather make $40,000 and do 10 hours of work and free up the other 30, 40 hours a week to go

01:07.680 --> 01:12.480
and grow it even more. Right. I'd way rather do that than do all the work and make a million

01:12.480 --> 01:17.840
dollars. Right. Cause my capacity is only that a million dollars. But for those of you that

01:17.840 --> 01:20.880
truly want to make this happen, you are going to need people on your team.

01:21.920 --> 01:26.880
I'm telling you, make sure you take care of them. Make sure that their concerns,

01:26.880 --> 01:32.480
their needs, their, you know, their goals, their dreams, they are important to you

01:33.280 --> 01:35.280
as much as yours are important to you.
