00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,160
Guys, welcome to module four and we're going to talk about the finish work.

2
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:13,880
We're going to talk about on page SEO and we're using the metaphor or we're using the

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,720
example of doing this with physical real estate.

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:23,320
So if we had a house or let's say that we had two houses, exact same square footage,

5
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:30,160
exact same bedrooms, exact same everything and one of these homes had nice finishes.

6
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:37,520
One of them had, you know, upgraded tile, upgraded fixtures, maybe it had heated floors,

7
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,360
maybe it had like a sauna inside.

8
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:45,880
That house, even though it's the same structure, could potentially sell for a lot more.

9
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:50,360
So though I think it's kind of a funny example because our websites are not that pretty,

10
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,480
I'm just giving you an example because what we do with our on page SEO, we can have two

11
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:00,640
different websites, one with spectacular on page SEO that can generate way more calls

12
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,280
than the exact same website that looks basically the same, almost identical, that does not

13
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,000
have the on page SEO done correctly.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,960
And therefore the first one would generate almost infinitely more leads.

15
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:17,560
And why is that for those of you that are still wrapping your head around this?

16
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,880
Because if we do the on page SEO correctly, we're going to rank our website and if we

17
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,520
rank our website, we're going to get organic traffic as long as it converts.

18
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,720
But I know it's going to convert because I'm showing you guys exactly what these websites

19
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,720
need to look like.

20
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:35,280
Long story short, guys, SEO, there are two different sections or two different parts

21
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,280
to SEO.

22
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,320
There's the on page and then there's the off page.

23
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,520
And we are going to talk about the on page SEO, which is exactly as it sounds, the things

24
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,640
that you do on the page.

25
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,120
So a couple of those things, and I'm just going to mention a few, and then we're going

26
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:53,760
to have individual sections, individual lessons talking about each one and showing you exactly

27
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,480
how to do each one.

28
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:59,120
Some of the elements to on page SEO.

29
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,120
Page titles.

30
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,680
And we're going to go into that, but that is what we actually title the page when you

31
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,600
are on your browser and you hover over the tab, what is that thing that pops up?

32
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,600
What is the page title?

33
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:14,240
Or when you go to Google and you type in concrete near me, what is that title that's underlined?

34
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,320
That's the page title.

35
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,120
We're also going to talk about the descriptions.

36
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,180
What do we put in the description?

37
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,800
How do we get people to click?

38
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,400
How many characters can we do?

39
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,400
We're going to talk about H1s.

40
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,400
We're going to talk about image optimization.

41
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,000
We're going to talk about a lot of different elements of on page optimization.

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,160
For some of you that might be junkies with this stuff, we're not going to go into every

43
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,600
little teeny thing, but we're going to talk about the most important things, the things

44
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:42,360
that have helped us and they have worked again and again and again and again.

45
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:48,440
These are the things that we do, always keeping in mind that if we do the job correctly with

46
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:53,640
what we talked about in module one of part one, looking for layups, we can eliminate

47
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,640
competition.

48
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,480
That is why I stress so much that we choose the right city and the right niche because

49
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:07,000
if the competition is not that great, we don't have to do all this stuff perfect.

50
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,240
We're going to do it as best we can and you're going to get better as you go, as you do this.

51
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,800
We're going to show you step by step exactly what to do in future videos.

52
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,200
Guys, get ready.

53
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:23,840
Let's figure out how we can master the elements of on page SEO and we'll see you in the next

54
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,340
video.
