sometimes this only doesn't always happen but sometimes you get people that are kind of more pushy

00:05.280 --> 00:09.760
so when you say well i can't promise like you said you know i care that you shouldn't care that

00:09.760 --> 00:15.280
you're getting 100 leads you should care that you're actually making money then they sometimes say

00:15.280 --> 00:22.080
well what kind of guarantees do i get then like what if you know and then one way that sometimes

00:22.080 --> 00:28.480
that i've worked around that that has worked is by saying well kind of like you said um it doesn't

00:28.480 --> 00:32.640
matter like i'm not going to be able to promise you because i would be lying how many leads are

00:32.640 --> 00:36.800
coming in but what i can promise you is that i'll make sure that every month you're not going in the

00:36.800 --> 00:40.880
red meaning you're not going to spend money with us and you're not going to make anything

00:41.680 --> 00:45.920
you know what i mean and if that happens that ever happens where you're not even breaking even

00:45.920 --> 00:50.800
we'll definitely have a talk and we'll work something out and i think that's what you personally care

00:50.800 --> 00:55.680
when you have a business so if you say that usually they're like oh okay i don't have to worry about

00:56.400 --> 01:04.000
you know not making any money or losing money with you i think that usually makes them feel

01:04.000 --> 01:08.880
more reassured doesn't make sense totally makes sense what and another thing that i like to say

01:08.880 --> 01:14.240
to people is i like to say like look there's no guarantees like they're just no guarantees the

01:14.240 --> 01:18.640
only thing i can guarantee you know that stupid saying like the only guarantee is death and taxes

01:18.640 --> 01:22.400
or whatever that's kind of cheesy but that's true and i just let them know i'm like look there's no

01:22.400 --> 01:27.760
guarantees i've done this for many many many years i've made you know people thousands and

01:27.760 --> 01:32.080
thousands of dollars and i would love to guarantee you but the truth is there is no guarantees

01:32.080 --> 01:40.080
because we don't know what google is going to do tomorrow however what i excuse me what i can

01:40.080 --> 01:45.520
guarantee mr business owner what i can guarantee mrs business owner is i can guarantee that i'm

01:45.600 --> 01:52.320
going to be doing the same exact work that i did on bob's website that got this many leads i'm

01:52.320 --> 01:56.480
going to do the same work and the same strategy that i did on joe's website that got the same

01:56.480 --> 02:01.680
this many leads that i showed you i can control the work that i do and then we kind of have to

02:01.680 --> 02:06.000
let the chips fall and that's just the truth and like that's that's kind of how life is so i'm

02:06.000 --> 02:11.520
going to do everything in my power i'll be able to guarantee you that i'm doing the work i'll be

02:11.520 --> 02:15.200
able to show you the work that i'm doing i'll be able to show you the steps that i'm taking

02:15.200 --> 02:18.560
and show you they're the same steps i'm taking on these other projects but at the end of the

02:18.560 --> 02:22.400
day there's no guarantee they're just i don't own google it's just how it is they could change

02:22.400 --> 02:26.800
something tomorrow now i i that's not what i think is going to happen but i just want you to

02:26.800 --> 02:32.080
understand like that's just how it is there's no guarantees and just likewise you know i know bob

02:32.080 --> 02:36.080
if i send you a hundred leads if i said to you how many are you going to close what can you answer

02:36.080 --> 02:42.000
me that question and they're like well no okay exactly and if you don't close deals guess what

02:42.080 --> 02:45.680
this isn't going to work either so you can't guarantee me you're going to close deals and

02:45.680 --> 02:49.760
i can't guarantee you this is it is what it is we're going to do the best that we can we're

02:49.760 --> 02:53.920
going to have open communication it's it's going to be a little bit slow in the beginning it's

02:53.920 --> 02:57.040
going to be a little rocky it's going to be a little up and down some months are going to be

02:57.040 --> 03:01.600
good some months are going to be bad but at the end of the day as soon as we get this website

03:01.600 --> 03:05.840
ranked we can lower the ads we can have more consistent lead flow and we're all going to

03:05.840 --> 03:09.680
make money but i need you to pick up the phone i need you to treat the customers well i'll do

03:09.680 --> 03:15.600
my job you do your job but that's it like we just we need to the biggest key no matter what you say

03:16.560 --> 03:23.200
there's no magic formula is stop over promising okay the whole time you're doing the sale the

03:23.200 --> 03:28.640
whole time you're doing the onboarding all your communication you think that by over promising

03:28.640 --> 03:34.080
by yes yes yes you know best case best case best case you think that's going to solidify the deal

03:34.080 --> 03:39.440
i promise you it's the opposite be transparent be conservative be worst case scenario and these

03:39.440 --> 03:42.800
people are going to trust you because no one's like that with them everyone wants to give them

03:42.800 --> 03:46.800
the best case scenario and they're they just they smell bs
