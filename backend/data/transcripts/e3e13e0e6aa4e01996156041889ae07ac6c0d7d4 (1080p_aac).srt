00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,420
["Take Me By Your Side"]

2
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:11,600
Guys, welcome to the setup.

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,820
I wanna talk about what the setup actually is.

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,820
Okay, first of all, most people,

5
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,100
when they train you sales,

6
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,140
no matter what sales training you go into,

7
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,440
no matter who you talk to,

8
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:24,540
most people just train you to wait for the objection

9
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,300
and then how to overcome that objection

10
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,900
or how to try to overcome that objection.

11
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,700
For example, when the customer says,

12
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,180
I wanna think about it, you say this.

13
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:32,900
When the customer says I need to talk to my spouse,

14
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,700
you say that, okay?

15
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,080
And that's exactly how I was trained.

16
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,700
But I realized that they're testing

17
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:39,740
a couple of different things

18
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:42,860
and just trial and error,

19
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:46,940
that the times when I brought up the objection first,

20
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:49,100
it always seemed to be a non-objection

21
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,980
when I got to the closing table, okay?

22
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:52,820
And I learned this very early on.

23
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,420
And so I wanna relate this to,

24
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,460
if you have kids or just think back to when you were a kid,

25
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,940
and I'm guessing this is probably the situation.

26
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,260
But for me, for example, if my kid does something stupid,

27
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:05,860
first of all, I'm gonna be mad no matter what, right?

28
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:08,700
But if I find out from their own mouth,

29
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,700
they come to me and say, hey dad, look man,

30
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:14,020
I broke the iPad, I'm gonna be ticked, right?

31
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,020
But I'm gonna be a lot less ticked

32
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,400
than if I just find a broken iPad lying on the ground.

33
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,140
So it's the same exact thing.

34
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,900
We know the objections are gonna come

35
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,900
and we're never gonna be able to avoid them,

36
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,780
whether it's now, whether it's later,

37
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,340
the objections will always come.

38
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:34,100
So why don't we just go and meet the objection?

39
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,380
Why don't we just offensively go meet the objection,

40
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:40,260
overcome them all in the setup phase

41
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,380
so that we don't have to deal with objections?

42
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:44,460
That's an interesting way to think about it, right?

43
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,660
And so I've heard something along the lines of,

44
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:47,940
and I've heard this from multiple people,

45
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:51,460
it's like the better your questions are,

46
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,860
the better the results that you're gonna get.

47
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,380
Something, I think I know I butchered that,

48
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,340
but whatever, you get the point, right?

49
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,460
And so instead of asking how do I overcome

50
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,260
I wanna think about it,

51
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:04,820
let's start asking how do we just avoid objections

52
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,860
or how do we just not have objections

53
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,660
during the Zoom close?

54
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,800
Well, I found a way and that is

55
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,060
we're gonna meet the objections head on

56
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,620
and we're gonna overcome them before they even come up.

57
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,460
So the setup, just to define it,

58
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:22,420
is the period from the moment you call and do the hook

59
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,860
until the moment you jump on the Zoom close

60
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,040
and do the close, okay?

61
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,080
During that entire period, that is the setup.

62
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,020
So guys, the close should and actually does happen

63
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,460
during the setup for a couple of reasons, okay?

64
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,460
And it should happen for a couple of reasons

65
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,300
during this period.

66
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,620
Number one is that it's not expected.

67
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,980
Everyone expects you to get on the Zoom close

68
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,660
and to have your spiel and get to the end

69
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:49,060
and do the hard close and have all these sales techniques,

70
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:52,060
but what they don't expect is to be closed

71
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,900
during these initial calls.

72
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:57,540
They don't expect to be closed during that initial hook.

73
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,300
They don't expect to be closed during a screencast.

74
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,100
They don't even know what a screencast is, right?

75
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,300
So they definitely don't expect it.

76
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,740
So number one is they don't expect

77
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,300
to be closed during this period.

78
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:12,260
The next thing is the business owner has their guard down

79
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,460
during this period, okay?

80
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,120
When they get on the Zoom close, make no mistake,

81
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,300
they're expecting to be sold,

82
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,340
they're expecting to be pitched something,

83
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,740
but during this phase, they're really open,

84
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:24,060
they're casual, they just don't expect it.

85
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,180
They're watching a screencast

86
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,060
and they're not expecting to be closed, okay?

87
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,520
And so without them even knowing,

88
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,280
we are overcoming objections in our conversations

89
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,880
on the phone and our text messages during our screencast,

90
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,620
they don't even realize it, okay?

91
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,220
And the last thing is what I love about this,

92
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:43,120
and this is why the deal should be closed during this phase,

93
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,540
is this is gonna take the pressure off of that last call.

94
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,580
That last call should be enjoyable.

95
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:51,060
Last call should be quick and easy and breezy,

96
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,580
and it should just be a matter of you getting

97
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,900
the credit card and you guys getting excited

98
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,340
about working together, okay?

99
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,460
So it's going to take the pressure

100
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:01,380
off of that big, scary, hard close,

101
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,500
and that is why it should be,

102
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,700
that is why the close should happen during the setup.

103
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:11,500
The objective of the setup, very, very, very simple, okay?

104
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:15,320
The objective is one thing, and that is to overcome

105
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:19,680
all the objections that you could potentially have

106
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,400
or that you know you will potentially have during this step.

107
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,240
And then we're gonna do it strategically,

108
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,220
we're gonna do it so it just makes sense,

109
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,000
there's no pressure, that's it.

110
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,820
The objective of this step is that we are going

111
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:36,720
to overcome all the objections offensively,

112
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,440
or what they used to teach me this word,

113
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,480
I don't even know if this is a word,

114
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,280
but we used to use the word preemptively,

115
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,180
meaning before it actually comes up.

116
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:46,700
The goal, the objective, is very simple.

117
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:50,540
Overcome the objections before they ever become objections.
