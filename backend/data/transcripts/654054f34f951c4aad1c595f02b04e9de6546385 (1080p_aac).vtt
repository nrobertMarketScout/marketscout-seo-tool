00:00.000 --> 00:05.720
When you do the hook, you call and you're like,

00:05.720 --> 00:07.800
hey, I want to send you a couple of free leads.

00:07.800 --> 00:10.640
I saw you're paying for ads, blah, blah, blah.

00:10.640 --> 00:13.120
I've seen a couple of posts where some of you guys are like,

00:13.120 --> 00:16.480
hey, I sent the client the first lead and it's been a week

00:16.480 --> 00:19.560
and we haven't gotten a lead.

00:19.560 --> 00:25.600
Quit pigeonholing yourself or painting yourself in a corner.

00:25.600 --> 00:26.720
Do you know what I do?

00:26.720 --> 00:28.360
I tell the business owner, I say, hey, look,

00:28.440 --> 00:32.040
I want to get you a couple of leads, two, three, four leads,

00:32.040 --> 00:33.800
and then let's talk.

00:33.800 --> 00:35.440
And I want to make sure they're good leads.

00:35.440 --> 00:37.160
So that might be in a couple of days.

00:37.160 --> 00:38.400
That might take a couple of weeks.

00:38.400 --> 00:39.720
I'm not really sure.

00:39.720 --> 00:40.520
It just depends.

00:40.520 --> 00:42.760
It kind of ebbs and flows.

00:42.760 --> 00:47.480
If you just said that, if you sent them a lead the first day

00:47.480 --> 00:50.400
and it took a week to send them the second lead,

00:50.400 --> 00:52.840
they would be fine because they're like, oh, yeah,

00:52.840 --> 00:55.160
he told me it might take a couple of weeks.

00:55.160 --> 00:58.120
The problem is you guys, without meaning to

00:58.120 --> 01:00.080
or maybe you are meaning to, you're like, hey,

01:00.080 --> 01:01.240
I'm going to send you three leads.

01:01.240 --> 01:02.240
I'm going to try and do it.

01:02.240 --> 01:05.920
Let's talk on this day at this time.

01:05.920 --> 01:08.720
And I understand if you guys have websites that are already

01:08.720 --> 01:10.320
generating leads, you can do that.

01:10.320 --> 01:13.360
But if you're running ads, guys, shit happens.

01:13.360 --> 01:15.360
Competitors click on your ads.

01:15.360 --> 01:18.640
Your ad accounts get suspended.

01:18.640 --> 01:20.320
There's weird weather issues.

01:20.320 --> 01:22.080
There's holidays.

01:22.080 --> 01:23.080
There's recessions.

01:23.080 --> 01:26.080
There's shit happening and wars and all

01:26.080 --> 01:27.080
these different factors.

01:27.080 --> 01:29.480
People get spooked and the Dow Jones goes down

01:29.480 --> 01:32.240
and we don't know all the factors.

01:32.240 --> 01:35.000
So quit painting yourself in a corner.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.360
Let the business owner know, hey,

01:36.360 --> 01:37.920
I'm going to get you two, three, four leads.

01:37.920 --> 01:38.920
Then we're going to talk.

01:38.920 --> 01:41.120
I'm hoping to talk in not too long,

01:41.120 --> 01:43.840
but it might be a week or two.

01:43.840 --> 01:45.160
It might be a couple of days.

01:45.160 --> 01:47.040
I just want to send you a couple of good ones.

01:47.040 --> 01:47.720
That sound fair?

01:47.720 --> 01:48.960
Cool.

01:48.960 --> 01:50.360
Then guess what?

01:50.360 --> 01:52.560
In their heads, they're expecting it potentially

01:52.560 --> 01:53.920
to take a couple of weeks.

01:53.920 --> 01:55.560
And you might call them in three days

01:55.560 --> 01:58.920
and have all the leads that they need to close the deal.
