Every time you make a change with Google, there is a period, sometimes it's like four days,

00:07.440 --> 00:14.720
sometimes it's seven days that Google has to go and relearn, if you will, what changes you made.

00:14.720 --> 00:19.200
So you go in, you change the ad copy and you notice there's a drop off. That's normal.

00:19.200 --> 00:24.000
Okay. You went in and you change the ad copy. So there's a learning period. It's going to be four

00:24.000 --> 00:28.480
to seven days before that starts picking up again. So for those of you that are sitting there,

00:28.480 --> 00:33.680
watching one campaign like a hawk and just change, change, change, change, change and nothing ever

00:33.680 --> 00:40.880
starts going. That's why. Okay. Set it up how we train, exactly how we train and leave it. If

00:40.880 --> 00:45.280
you're not getting clicks, leave it a little bit longer. Then when you start getting clicks,

00:45.280 --> 00:48.800
let's start addressing it. Okay. We're not, we're getting clicks. We're not getting calls. Look at

00:48.800 --> 00:54.240
the landing page. We'll start diving into it. But if I could say anything, do your best to not go

00:54.240 --> 00:58.080
and tweak it every five seconds, not going to mess with it every five seconds.
