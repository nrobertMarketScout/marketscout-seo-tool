1

00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:20,760
Hold on just a second, all right, guys welcome to the call, welcome Craig just joined, maybe.

4
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:28,220
I'm not really sure, okay, now he's back, let's see.

5
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:32,260
Let's see what we got here, there's Craig, all right Craig welcome to the call man, good

6
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:36,100
to have you on, I've got this thing recording, let's jump right into it, I just want to pull

7
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:40,900
up a couple notes to make sure I don't miss anything and it's gonna make me sign in, hold

8
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:47,060
on one second guys, I hope it's not making me do the two-step note, we're good, okay.

9
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,860
Just want to make sure we don't miss anything, I've got a few things I wanted to make sure

10
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:55,860
just to cover really quick and then let's dive into some Q&A, go over anything you guys

11
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:02,580
want to talk about, I've got a few things I want to cover and let's start off this

12
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:08,420
Monday morning, I guess it's 7 a.m. for you guys depending on where you're at, all right,

13
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:19,640
here we are, okay, as long as you guys can hear me let's get started, so guys, Craig

14
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:29,780
is here, what am I seeing over here, okay, all right guys, March 3rd, we're two months

15
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:37,980
into the new year, crazy hot times flying, I would highly encourage you guys if you haven't

16
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:44,960
made a habit of doing this is take the first Monday of every month, Monday, Tuesday and

17
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,060
look at how your month went, did you hit the goals that you set, your revenue goals,

18
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:53,480
if you didn't hit your revenue goals, hold on, letting people in, there's Frank back

19
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:58,920
in the house, okay, if you didn't hit your revenue goals, why, did you not do enough

20
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,400
appointments, did you not do enough Zoom calls, if you didn't do enough Zoom calls, why is

21
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:08,280
that, did you not get enough business owners on the hook, what I'm going to be doing today

22
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:14,880
in about an hour after this call finishes is I'm going to be going through, got my

23
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:20,760
goals in my notebook here and I'll be looking at what, you know, where we actually ended

24
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:25,840
up for the month versus where our goal was to end up and then just course correct, guys,

25
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,180
it's very simple stuff but it's just like if we were trying to go from, just like the

26
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:36,360
example I always like to use, if our roadmap, if we started in Washington where Paul's at

27
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:42,800
and we wanted to get to Miami and Miami would be representative of our goal of $20,000 per

28
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:50,840
month by July 1st or by December 31st, right, you want to take inventory and find out, okay,

29
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:57,280
it's two months in and we're all the way over in Idaho when we should be down in, I don't

30
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,720
know, Denver, I don't even know where the path would be but okay, that's fine, you guys,

31
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:08,240
we can still get to Miami but now we got to take a different direction, we've got to speed

32
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:12,880
it up, we can't take as many breaks, we've got to, you know, maybe increase the speed

33
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:18,960
that we were going to go by five miles per hour for the next, you know, two months, whatever,

34
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,640
but guys, you have to be taking inventory.

35
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:26,080
One thing I did not do last year is I set my goals and I just kind of like, just did

36
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,080
my thing.

37
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:31,600
I didn't check on them, I didn't, you know, audit where we were at and that was a huge

38
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,600
mistake.

39
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,720
This year so far I've done a really good job and at the end of last month I went and I

40
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:42,080
just took my notebook, looked at my goals, we had our biggest month of the last 12 months

41
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,520
was January and I was like, what do we do right, what do we do wrong and anyway, just

42
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:50,600
a simple thing, you guys, just take an hour, look at your goals and by the way, if you

43
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,480
don't even have your goals, go watch the, we have a mini course called Map Your Goals

44
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,240
or I think it's called Map Your Goals, go watch that, set your goals.

45
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:05,480
You guys, what we use, I think I talk about it in the training, but I use this book, Think

46
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:10,840
and Grow Rich, one of the sections in here, one of the chapters in here talks about basically

47
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,320
goal setting and we use the framework from this book to set your goals, okay, that's

48
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:24,320
what I like and I think it's chapter, I think it's chapter, what chapter is it, let me just

49
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,560
tell you guys in case you want to check it out.

50
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:36,440
I think it is chapter, dang, these chapters are a little bit beefy, hold on, hold on,

51
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:48,040
I think it's chapter seven, I think it's chapter seven, I could be wrong, but anyway, I'm almost

52
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:53,320
positive it's chapter seven, maybe somebody can back me up there, but anyway, yes, under

53
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,800
organized planning, I think this is the chapter that you're going to want to use.

54
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,400
Anyway, if you guys haven't set your goals, please do that, please do that, it's going

55
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,600
to be huge for you guys, okay.

56
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:09,400
Other thing I want to say really quick and then we'll get into Q&A, a couple weeks ago

57
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:17,960
I shared a link inside of the group, inside of the school community and it was a link

58
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:23,720
to a book called The Slide Edge, okay, free link, free PDF and I just said to you guys

59
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,480
this book, I think I said this book will change your life and I want you guys to know that

60
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:31,760
I started this book around, this is my fifth time reading it, fourth or fifth time reading

61
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:38,000
it, I started this book around the last week of January, I just finished it on Saturday,

62
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:45,880
okay, I was on the treadmill, finished the last pages, guys, this book, it's such a simple

63
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:52,520
book, it's such an easy read, but I promise you and it's not an affiliate link, it's

64
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,600
none of that, it will change your life.

65
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:02,400
If you just read the book 10 pages a day, you read the book, you do the actions, I've

66
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,640
recommended my little, I've recommended everybody in digital landlords to read it, I've personally

67
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,240
asked my little brother Porter to read it, which by the way, I think he's like a fourth

68
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,600
the way through, I bought multiple copies for people, it is a phenomenal book, if you

69
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:21,640
feel like you're stuck in a rut, if you feel like you can't quite get that momentum, if

70
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:26,800
you feel like you're just, you're right there on the cusp that you can't get it, go read

71
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:32,120
this book, okay, slide edge 10 pages a day, it'll freaking change your life and I'm telling

72
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:37,720
you that again, I have no, I'm not getting paid to say that, whatever, okay, but guys,

73
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,720
what this book's done for me, it's just allowed me, it just helped me to have a number one

74
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:47,200
realize that it's literally this game is about doing all these little things correctly and

75
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:52,440
doing them again and again and again and again and when you start doing the little things

76
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:56,520
in one area, it bleeds to another area and it bleeds to another area and it bleeds to

77
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:00,440
another area and that's in the negative and in the positive, okay, so let me just give

78
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:07,400
you an example, last year, something that I was not very good at is I was very lazy

79
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,720
about when I would travel, okay, I would look at the, I would go to book my travel

80
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,400
and I would travel any day of the week, sometimes it was a Monday, sometimes it was a Wednesday,

81
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:19,520
sometimes it was a Friday, sometimes it was a Sunday and what would happen is sometimes

82
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:25,360
I would leave Dubai, let's say like on a Monday or a Tuesday, I miss the whole Tuesday, I

83
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,120
get in, I miss the whole Wednesday, I'm jet lagged for Thursday and then I want to spend

84
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:35,560
time with my kids on Friday, I was missing entire weeks because of just that little decision

85
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:40,380
of not even thinking about when should I book my flight.

86
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:45,800
This year, I'm very intentional about, hey, I'm not missing work days, I'll travel on

87
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:53,080
the weekends and I'll miss my weekends, I'll sacrifice going out on the weekend so I can

88
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:58,980
travel, I can get to my spot, get set up, get rested and get ready to go.

89
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:04,900
So I was coming to London, I think I already said that, I came to London and I was trying

90
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:08,400
to figure out when should I go, when should I go, when should I go and I literally made

91
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:14,180
the decision to come here on a Friday, like a Friday afternoon so I could work the morning

92
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:18,640
and then I could work a little bit on the plane and then guys, I got here, the room

93
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:24,020
wasn't ready of course, it was like 12, I hadn't slept much at all, I was so tired

94
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:28,180
but basically what I did is on Friday, I planned my day Friday like I was going to run the

95
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:32,180
whole day and then I said to myself, whatever I miss, whatever I don't get on Friday when

96
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:36,140
I'm traveling, I'm going to move it to Saturday and I'm going to take care of it and it sounds

97
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,580
like a great idea until it's actually Saturday and you actually have to do it and you actually

98
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:44,300
have to work and you're tired and your room's not ready but needless to say guys, Saturday

99
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:50,300
before I took a nap, before I did anything, I got here, I went to a coffee shop, I busted

100
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:55,260
out a couple hours of work, got some food, finally got checked in the room, did another

101
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:58,660
30 minutes of work and then I finally let myself sleep, okay.

102
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:04,020
I woke up before I went out, did anything, I went to the gym, these little teeny, these

103
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:11,260
little things guys, they are all adding up and it's crazy because they're all contributing

104
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:19,800
to like I've never, I feel momentum like I haven't in years, okay, again, this all comes

105
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:25,140
back to one thing, reading 10 pages of The Slide Edge every single day for the month

106
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:29,900
of February and it's completely transformed my entire business, I feel so much momentum,

107
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:35,300
I feel excited, I'm pumped, so I want to, I'm giving you guys a gift, there's a PDF,

108
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:41,100
type in Slide Edge PDF, it's completely free, you guys read 10 pages, they will change your

109
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,100
life, okay.

110
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:45,140
All right, that's it guys, that's all I want to share, let me turn the AC off, it's blowing

111
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:49,900
right on me, hold on.

112
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:54,140
And let's get into it guys, one quick thing, if you guys haven't already, please go and

120
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:57,860
can you guys see my screen by the way, can you let me know in the chat, can anybody see

121
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:02,940

122
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:08,500

123
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:14,860

00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:21,980
world map, and then you're going to just click on this link here, and what you'll do is this

125
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:27,540
little button in the corner, this purple button, you'll click this, okay, and let me move this

126
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:32,180
really quick, it's going to say right here, add location, you take your ID, your school

127
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:39,980
ID, so for me, if I go to my thing here, my profile, I have this school ID right here,

128
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:48,660
I click on this, I go here, my display name, Nicholas Wood, and then my location, I'm going

129
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:57,700
to be, I'm in London right now, so I'm going to put London, UK, and boom, looks like me,

130
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:05,980
oh, here we go, I'm in London, and then Mr. Simon Tasker is also in London, okay, so guys,

131
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:10,340
go do that, it takes two seconds, it's just really cool to see where people are, who's

132
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:15,300
over here, somebody in Bulgaria, I think I saw that one last time, okay, great, and then

133
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:19,980

some of you guys have, but you have to actually go in and hit this button, and add your location,

135
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:31,700
if you don't do that, it's not going to work, okay, all right, I think that's it, I think

136
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:36,740
we can get into the good stuff, let me just double check here, okay, okay, yeah, there

137
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:40,220
is one more thing I want to cover, I think I mentioned this, or I did mention this, I

138
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:46,580
don't know if I did on this call, but I made a post, guys, I am working on a new, I'm actually,

139
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:51,300
the truth is, so I've been working on a new course for this community, and then we're

140
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:56,760
calling it the step-by-step guide to landing your first thousand dollar per month deal,

141
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:03,760
it's going to be literally breaking it down by week of what tasks you should do, it's

142
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:10,280
going to be very in-depth, very exact of what you should do to get that first deal, okay,

143
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:15,120
I'm really excited about it, I put in a lot of hours already, and all that I really have

144
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:21,160
left to do is the actual filming, so the hard stuff of writing the script of what I want

145
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:25,880
to put in it, the outline, what kind of resources, what kind of maps do I want to create, what

146
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:30,080
kind of, you know, all this different stuff, that part's just about done, I actually worked

147
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:34,160
on it this morning for about an hour, I made a post that said we're going to be dropping

148
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:39,200
a new course, I thought this was going to be really easy to create, and then I decided

149
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:44,240
that what I want to do, guys, and what I'm going to do is I'm actually going to, I'm

150
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:49,280
going to be changing the way that this entire community is consumed in all the content,

151
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,960
because right now we have a bunch of really good content, we have 15 mini courses, we

152
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,880
have so much stuff, and yes, I told you guys to start in the left and go to the right and

153
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,840
go like this, but I need to get even, I think I need to get even more specific of telling

154
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:06,440
you exactly what I think you should do on week one, day one, week two, week three, week

155
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:10,640
four, so I'm actually completely reorganizing everything, nothing that's in there's going

156
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:15,360
to be lost, I'm reorganizing everything in the way that it's consumed, I'm super pumped

157
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,480
about it, but I just want to give you guys an update, I said that was going to be done

158
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:22,680
in March, it is going to be done in March, but you got to give me probably this weekend,

159
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:27,520
next week, I'm going to have it, try to have it done by mid-March, this week, I'm in Paris,

160
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:31,360
I fly to Sierra Leone on Sunday, and then I'll spend the first week in Sierra Leone

161
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:37,120
filming it and have that thing live, so that is going to literally be live this month,

162
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:44,240
so if you guys saw that post, that's an update on that, so you guys have an idea, okay?

163
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,080
And then the last thing, I keep saying the last thing, but I just want these little tiny

164
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:53,480
updates, inside of every time we get done with these lives, these Q&A's, you can go

165
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:59,320
in like an hour after and we're going to have the replay inside of the replays mini course,

166
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:03,120
and we actually, I said I was going to do this last time, so we went in, and now what

167
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,720
we'll do is we break down all the different questions that are covered and time stamp

168
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:12,760
each question, so you can go through and literally just click on the video, fast forward to the

169
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:16,520
question you want answered, listen to your answer, and go move on and get to work, okay?

170
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,240
All the replays from when we started, I think there's like six, seven weeks worth now, you

171
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,200
guys can go check those out if you missed one, you can go look at the questions that

172
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:28,400
were covered, boom, scroll to that, and go and consume it really quick, and you guys

173
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,680
are done, okay?

174
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:37,880
So guys, let's get into it, what questions do you guys have for me on the business, on

175
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,880
anything related?

176
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,600
I'll give you guys an update on my agency here in a second, but let me see what questions

177
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,440
you guys have.

178
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:51,480
By the way, well, let me go start at the top here, okay, Craig said, goal setting for me

179
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:57,080
is the easy part, translating into data execution seems to be the gap in moving the needle,

180
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:06,480
lead lag activities, suggestions in changing that, so Craig, answer this in the comments

181
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:13,560
for me, is do you not know which daily activities you should execute, or are you just having

182
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:17,320
a hard time actually doing the thing?

183
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:21,280
Give me that clarification, we'll keep moving along with that thread, okay?

184
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:26,700
Okay, Paul says, are the videos you guys were putting together for Rare available yet?

185
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:32,440
Great question, that's something that Ryan's taken care of, let me message him right now

186
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:37,560
and ask, I know you asked a question about Rare last time, Paul, and I appreciate it,

187
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:41,440
and if you didn't get the answer, you should have, you asked me where does the data come

188
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:47,040
from, for the backlinking, the backlinking data, and it comes directly from Majestic,

189
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:52,920
which is like a really, really great tool for, the only problem is it only does backlinks,

190
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,800
that's it, but the data comes directly from Majestic, okay?

191
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:10,520
So let me ask Ryan really quick, I'm just gonna send him a quick text, okay, I will

192
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:19,280
have an answer for you, Paul, as soon as possible, there's Porter joining right now, okay, Francesco

193
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:24,320
says, how would you structure a Google Ads account and how would you organize keyword

194
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:31,320
ad groups, one group for a concrete contractors on or multiple services?

195
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:39,160
Okay, so I think it was you, Francesco, I think, I'm pretty sure I made a comment on

196
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:43,480
your post, you asked, I think you asked a part of this question, or maybe it was a bigger

197
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:49,000
part of this question, so I'm gonna give a little bit of guidance here, but I want you

198
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,680
to understand that I want you to be, I want everybody to be very careful with Google Ads,

199
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:59,240
okay, you need to understand that yes, Google Ads is a great part of the puzzle, it allows

200
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:04,360
you to move faster, it allows you to go and put up a one-pager today, run Google Ads,

201
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:10,280
get the things sped up and hopefully get a deal, at the same time, you have to remember,

202
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:16,960
I have spent $1.5 million, I have been doing Google Ads since 2020, I have lost a lot of

203
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:25,420
money and this is not even including the amount of money, guys, in the last year, I've spent

204
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:32,080
probably close to another 10 grand just on, listen to this, I've spent close to, maybe,

205
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:38,360
no, it's probably more than that, let's say about 10 grand, just in the last year, because

206
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:42,080
I was like, you know what, I think we can make our Google Ads training just a little

207
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,280
bit better, I'm talking about Inside Digital Landlords, I went, I found this guy that was

208
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:51,640
supposed to be really good, highly recommended and said, hey, give me a proposal, I want

209
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:56,440
to work with you, I want you to show me what you can do, I'm gonna let you run my campaigns,

210
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:01,120
I'm gonna pay you to run my campaigns and this individual ran my campaigns for months

211
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:07,040
and, long story short, they weren't really performing any better than what we were already

212
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:11,520
doing and I was paying a lot more money and it was a lot more difficult to set up and

213
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:16,760
all this stuff, so I spent $10,000 and all that I learned was that that guy didn't have

214
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:20,800
anything that I didn't already have, okay, so I'm telling you this because sometimes

215
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:24,440
we get in, we hear about running ads and we just think we're gonna throw up an ad and

216
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:28,360
leads are gonna come in, or I'm gonna give you one little answer and it's gonna change,

217
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:35,160
just understand that you either have to pay the $1.5 million to learn it or you need to

218
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:40,080
get proper training, which is what we do inside of Digital Landlords for Google Ads and I

219
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,680
want to say that because there's no way I could cover, now, why don't I cover more Google

220
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:48,640
Ads inside of the RankinRant Academy, well, the reason why is because I don't want this

221
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:53,700
to turn into a customer service nightmare, okay, once you commit to actually doing this

222
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:57,740
business for real, for real, for real and you're inside Digital Landlords, I know that

223
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:00,740
you're gonna do the business, I know that you have to make it work because you've committed

224
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:05,100
with your money, with your time, you've signed on a piece of paper, hey, I'm gonna do this

225
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:10,580
and so now let's do it, okay, but for me to come in and teach ads to people that a lot

226
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:14,460
of you guys or a lot of people inside of our community, a lot of them are just checking

227
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:18,540
this out, seeing if it's what they want to do, it's literally just gonna turn into a

228
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:22,180
customer service nightmare, so it's just not economical, it doesn't make any sense for

229
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:26,980
me to talk at length, okay, but back to your question really, really quick, so how would

230
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:31,380
you structure a Google Ads account and how would you organize keyword ad groups, one

231
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:40,940
group for keyword contractors, example, multiple services, so again, I try to keep things really

232
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:48,100
simple, okay, with our Google Ads, what I try to do just to be very transparent is I

233
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:54,540
try to like literally set up the most basic ads as possible and start tweaking, start

234
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:59,100
learning for years, I didn't even run negative keywords, I still don't like do a lot of that

235
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:04,020
stuff, I know, you know, Jeff is, we have a guy inside digital landlords that is kind

236
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:08,340
of our, he's our ad specialist, he does office hours, for those of you that are in digital

237
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:14,340
landlords by the way, Paul and you guys, what we've done is over the last week, we've taken

238
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:20,340
all the live, the office hours that Jeff's done, and we've kind of organized them into a

239
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:23,540
folder and we're going to start putting them inside of the training inside digital landlords,

240
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:27,300
you guys will be able to go and check through those, but you know, some of the things that

241
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:33,300
he'll say is like, you know, you can set the ads to start running at 7am and stop running

242
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:38,660
at 7pm, I don't even mess with that stuff, okay, you can, I don't think it's bad, what my only

243
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:43,540
advice I'm going to give you is to just simplify it, with this specific example,

244
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:48,900
there's no way that we could go into that and not confuse a bunch of people,

245
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:53,140
if you want to message me privately, then I can maybe point you in the right direction with some

246
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:59,780
resources, but we just don't cover a lot of the ad stuff, especially like those nuanced questions,

247
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:04,260
because there's more, you need more context, there's more to it than just, you know,

248
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:08,740
what is the budget? Well, and I know that's not what you're asking, but if somebody asks,

249
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:13,700
what should you set the daily budget at? Well, it really depends, you know, should I let it go

250
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:19,380
higher than five bucks per cost per click? Well, what are you, what factors are we, what's, what,

251
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:23,780
you know, what niche are we looking at? What city, what kind of budget, what kind of a deal are you

252
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:28,340
looking to sign? How much budget are you going to have? You know, how, like there's so many

253
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:33,140
different factors, so if you want, you can message me privately on school, I'll see what I can

254
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:36,980
do to, in terms of pointing you in the right direction, but that's the stuff that we cover

255
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:45,860
more into the more in-depth training, okay? Okay, let's keep going. Craig says, I think I just

256
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:54,740
answered my question clearly defined why. Okay, he's talking about executing. Sorry,

257
00:22:54,740 --> 00:23:02,740
I'm jumping ahead here. Okay. What's that? Craig, let's go up to Michael says, how do you

258
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:06,580
overcome the objection of track record or past successes when closing the first deal,

259
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:11,620
not having an example testimonies? Porter, are you still on this Porter? If you are, dude, hop on.

260
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:14,580
Let me ask you to unmute. I'm going to help you have you answer this question because this is

261
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:19,620
something you just barely dealt with. Let me see if Porter's on right now. If Porter is, I'm going

262
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:23,780
to have him all answered. If not, oh, there he is. Porter, can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you.

263
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:27,620
Beautiful. I want you to answer this question for Michael, just because this is something

264
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:32,420
you're currently dealing with, but he says, how do you overcome the objection of track records?

265
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:37,380
You get on a call with the business owner. It's your first deal. They don't have any other proof,

266
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:42,580
you don't have any other websites to show anybody of, hey, I did this for so-and-so.

267
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:49,060
How do you deal with that at the business owners asking you for references or whatever? How did

268
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:55,620
you get your first deal that way? When I have anything, I honestly was just super transparent.

269
00:23:55,620 --> 00:24:02,100
I wasn't like, you're my first deal, but in a way I was like, I want to build this relationship

270
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:06,820
off trust. I understand you probably want proof and all this, but I've sent you three or four

271
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:12,820
leads. You've quoted them. I'm getting the jobs. I want to build this out of trust. If you have any

272
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:18,900
second thoughts now, then I would rather you tell me, then we get into this some months.

273
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:23,220
I almost just play that card because, again, I don't want to lie to the guy, but again,

274
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:28,340
you want to work with someone that's not always questioning you. If he's questioning you, it's

275
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:33,940
most likely you've maybe done something in the past. You haven't quite earned their trust enough

276
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:39,300
for them not to, because when I did it right the first time, no one asked me about it, but I've

277
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:43,540
been asked that when I haven't gained enough trust before the call. Does that make sense?

278
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:50,420
Yeah, it's true. This is one of the things to remember, Michael, is if you are getting the

279
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:56,660
same objection again and again and again, it's usually something that at a subconscious level

280
00:24:56,660 --> 00:25:02,420
you have an issue with. For example, people that I always hear are like, how do you get around price?

281
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:07,940
How do you get around price? Dude, I never get objection of price. I think one of the reasons

282
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:14,900
why is because to me, if you tell me, hey, it's a thousand bucks a month, that is not to me personally

283
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:20,660
because I've been in business. I know what stuff costs. I know what it costs to pay for employees,

284
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:24,660
to pay for an office. A thousand bucks a month is just another bill,

285
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:30,740
right? But sometimes when we start business and we're used to a $4,000 a month salary

286
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:36,820
and every hundred dollars counts, and I've been there and we're asking people for a thousand bucks

287
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:40,180
a month, and you know that if somebody asks you for a thousand bucks a month, it would scare the

288
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:45,700
crap out of you. What you're doing is you're selling out of your own wallet, and so you're

289
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:54,660
projecting whatever. I never get price. I never get price objection. I never get contract objection.

290
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:59,780
Why? Because I've resolved these objections in myself, and I've seen this with sales reps.

291
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:04,340
I've seen this with people that I've trained in all kinds of different areas. If you are continually

292
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:07,220
getting that, I don't know if you are, but if Michael, if you're getting this again and again,

293
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:16,420
you have to realize that you're probably somebody, I'm guessing, that has to see a track record or

294
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:20,100
whatever, but I like what Porter said, and I think it's really true, is you just be transparent. You

295
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:24,180
probably don't go in like Porter's saying and be like, yeah, this is my very first client ever.

296
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:29,140
Congratulations. However, I think it's fine to just be very transparent and be like, hey,

297
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:35,060
I'm actually pretty new to this, but look, I've already sent you three leads. The proof's in the

298
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:39,540
pudding, and I'd love to earn your business, and you can even frame it like you're giving them a

299
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:43,380
bit of a deal as long as they give a testimony like, hey, I'm normally going to charge $1,500

300
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:47,460
for this. I'm only going to charge you $1,000 if you'll give me a testimony once this is said

301
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:54,340
and done. That's one way. Another thing that you can do is you can borrow off of other people's

302
00:26:54,340 --> 00:27:00,740
success. I'm more than happy if you guys want to use one of my websites, like Bentonville Concrete,

303
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:06,660
and show them, hey, this is one of our partner sites, blah, blah, blah. Can you come back in

304
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:14,340
20 minutes? Hold on. Porter, keep going. Yeah. No, and that's a good point. For my first deal,

305
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:20,660
I actually used Bentonville Concrete as a site that would say, hey, this is the goal. Obviously,

306
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:24,580
I don't have one that I've ranked organically myself because I'm pre-sold by pre-selling,

307
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:30,340
but I have used Bentonville Arkansas to close my first deal. Again, if they're wanting like, hey,

308
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:36,020
do you have other reviews of a website for your company? It's like, no, I don't have a website.

309
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:40,580
I don't have any other clients. You're my first client, but you don't say that. Yeah,

310
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:45,700
I think it's totally chill. Up until just recently, I started using my own sites,

311
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:48,500
but I was using Bentonville Arkansas for my first five deals.

312
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:53,780
It's not a big deal if you guys want to do that. Guys, when I first started knocking doors,

313
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:56,580
you know what they trained me on? They said the same thing. They're like, well,

314
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:59,860
when you knock on the door, you want to name drop a couple of people you've started working,

315
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:03,460
you've done deals for, and I'm like, well, this is my first deal. They're like, well,

316
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:10,260
I just closed this lady named Susie, and there's this other guy named Danny, so you're going to

317
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:14,820
use those names, and they gave me their last names, whatever. So I'd knock on the door,

318
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:21,140
keep in mind I'm in Arkansas, and I'm like, hey, you happen to know Lucy down the street,

319
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:25,540
or I can't remember if it was, anyway. I'm like, do you know so-and-so? I've used the full name,

320
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:30,820
Lucy Smith. Oh, you don't know Lucy? Meanwhile, she's in Utah, right? They're customers,

321
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:33,940
but I'm like, yeah, we just set them up, which we did. They're just in Utah.

322
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:41,300
We kind of just leveraged that confidence. Anyway, you could do it any way you want to do.

323
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:48,100
You don't have to be shady or anything like that, but just be transparent. It's the same

324
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:52,580
thing when people always ask me, what do you do when the business owner asks you

325
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:59,940
how you're getting the leads? I'm like, you tell them? You tell them. What do you mean?

326
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:04,420
Well, you want to show them the website? Yeah. What if they ask you if you're running ads?

327
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:09,060
Yeah. What's there to hide? Yeah, I'm running ads, dude. I'm getting you leads. You got a

328
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:14,180
problem with that? It doesn't matter. Same thing, but it's a bit nerve-racking when you

329
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:21,140
don't have your first deal. Just use Bentonville Concrete. Use any of my websites. Be transparent

330
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:26,180
with them. Again, coming back to what Porter said, if you give leads up front, that's going

331
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:30,900
to overcome most of the objections. That's going to help eliminate the biggest objection,

332
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:34,820
which is the trust issue. That's what you're dealing with is the person doesn't totally

333
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:39,860
trust you yet because they're asking for reviews. I would say to them, Mr. Business

334
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:45,540
Owner, what do you need to see? My leads is my credentials. You're getting leads. What

335
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:50,980
else do you need to know? You know what I'm saying? Usually they don't care. Even if you

336
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:54,660
ranked organically and you're getting them leads and they're not making money, they're going to

337
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:59,620
stop working with you regardless. Or you could be paying for Google Ads and be sending them the

338
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:04,260
same leads and they could be making money on them. They don't care where they're coming from. As

339
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:08,660
long as they're making money, they're not going to ask questions. Very true. Very true.

340
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:14,260
Let's see. This is a good question here. I want to address it.

341
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:19,460
Craig was talking about, he's like goal setting is the easy part. Then he's like,

342
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:25,460
how do you translate it into daily execution? I asked him, I said, is your problem with

343
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:31,540
figuring out what to do or actually executing on it? He said that he answered his own question.

344
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:35,300
He said executing. Then a little bit later, he said, I think I just answered my own question,

345
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:43,220
clearly defining why. Porter, let me ask you about this. You've been doing this about two years.

346
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:48,340
You've probably had times where, because you've set your goals, you know exactly what you need

347
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:53,140
to do. This week, I need to hook two business owners, whatever. Let's say that's your activities.

348
00:30:54,420 --> 00:31:01,460
How have you been able to get more consistent with actually executing on the things

349
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:05,700
that you need to do? What would you say your advice is? Because I know that there's been

350
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:09,940
times when you've kind of sloughed off or gotten distracted. Then recently, this year,

351
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:16,180
if you guys weren't inside of digital landlords, me and Porter, was it last week? I think so. Maybe

352
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:21,300
last week we talked about replacing business owners. Porter actually lost two business

353
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:29,860
owners in the same day and replaced them the same day. Then he also hooked somebody else. Then

354
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:36,420
he had them on trial. Porter gets a lot more nos than he talks about. He's got somebody else

355
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:43,220
on trial. Anyway, how have you been able to stay consistent with executing the actual activities?

356
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:48,660
Hey, I need to hook a business owner every week. In order to do that, I need to call

357
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:54,020
five business owners. Not call, but talk to five business owners. How do you get yourself to

358
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:57,780
consistently do that? It's easy to put it down. It's hard to actually do. What are some tips?

359
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:04,500
I think the first thing is to share your goals with somebody else, whether it's the group or

360
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:09,060
someone that you feel like is actually going to hold you accountable. I think as soon as I told

361
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:16,100
people within the group that I was making 10K, the last thing I want to do is to either get on a call

362
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:22,580
and not be at 10K when we're talking about making money at 10K. My standard was, oh, I'm just kind

363
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:30,660
of below 10K to now. I've hit the 10K and my pride is I don't want to get below that. It's crazy

364
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:36,100
what your mind and what you can accomplish when you are like, hey, I'm just not dropping below

365
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:41,540
this. Me and Nick talked about this before, but it's like a thermostat. As soon as the temperature

366
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:47,780
drops below a certain point, the AC unit or the heater kicks on and then it gets to a certain

367
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:53,620
point. Then we get comfortable and then it kicks off. I think that was my biggest thing is I'm

368
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:58,260
still trying to figure this out, but I want to consistently be going this way and not just feel

369
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:04,740
like this comfort. I just think for me, it's like share your goals with people and set your

370
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:11,380
standards of this is just who I am. This is what I do because I think that's the hardest thing is

371
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:17,540
I was doing this consistently, but was I actually bought into it? Was I actually doing it to make

372
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:21,140
money or was I doing it to say, hey, I was just doing this business model every day? I wasn't

373
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:29,540
really moving the needle. Like last week, I had this guy that I had hooked that Nick was talking

374
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:35,220
about. Basically, we didn't make it to the call and I immediately got back on the phone and I

375
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:39,700
called someone and I have a Zoom call scheduled for Saturday, which they had to push it today,

376
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:45,700
so I rescheduled it. It's at 430 today. Before that, I felt like it would have really discouraged

377
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:50,100
me because I would have lost that deal technically, but then it's like I could

378
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:53,460
have waited a week to call somebody else, but you just get back on the phone and you're like,

379
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:59,220
I want to get past that 10K. I don't want to be just barely over 10K. That's just my standard now.

380
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:04,020
That's probably the best way that I can explain it now. I'm still working on it. I'm not perfect,

381
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:06,340
but that's just kind of what has really driven me recently.

382
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:10,500
Good. Yeah. I mean, at the end of the day,

383
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:20,340
it's like, and I think you answered your own question. He said clearly defining his why.

384
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:31,700
It's like when I wake up tired and not excited about stuff, I'll be honest, this morning I woke

385
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:38,340
up. I'm still a little jet lagged. I don't know why, but I woke up and I woke up at 630.

386
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:45,940
I did my regular stuff. The first hour, I wasn't jacked about sitting down,

387
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:55,380
planning out all my employees' to-do lists, and then planning my team meeting.

388
00:34:56,180 --> 00:35:02,180
I have the same Monday pretty much every single Monday. I wasn't super thrilled about it,

389
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:08,660
and I didn't feel that great either, just for the record. But I know, and I remember thinking

390
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:15,700
there are certain things that I want to do this year that's going to require a certain amount

391
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:19,380
of capital. There's been some investments that I really, really want to make that's going to put

392
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:29,060
me in a position to be very, very set in terms of passive income. And in order for me to be part

393
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:35,860
of these projects, I'm going to need to bring a lot of money to the table. Because I know exactly

394
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:38,900
what I want to do, where I'm going to put that money, how much money I need to bring in,

395
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:44,740
when I start getting tired, I'm like, dude, Nick, just pull out of it for a second, go walk around

396
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:50,100
the block, whatever, do some press ups, drink some water, get back to it. It's all going to

397
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:55,860
be worth it in the end. So yes, defining your why and exactly why you're doing this. And then

398
00:35:56,980 --> 00:36:01,460
also just think about the alternative. If that doesn't inspire you, if you don't have a why that

399
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:05,060
inspires you, think about the alternative. Think about what life is going to look like if you keep

400
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:10,660
on the same path that you're on right now. Just like, let's say we even were Porter's at. Porter's

401
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:15,940
making 10K a month. That's great. He's in a much better position than he was making $0 per month

402
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:23,940
and just making money from his full-time thing. But if he stays the same, he's going to just be

403
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:31,540
at 10K per month in five years. That's not exciting. That's terrible. So I always think about,

404
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:36,660
if you know exactly what you want, why you want it, but then also just look at what's the

405
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:41,940
alternative. For me, I'm so terrified of waking up and realizing I just wasted it.

406
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:49,540
And not only I just wasted it, but I was just another average freaking dude that's like,

407
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:56,660
yeah, he was a good guy and he was a hard worker. And it's like, so? Everybody's a good guy and a

408
00:36:56,660 --> 00:37:02,820
hard worker. I want to be somebody that actually did something huge and did something that changed

409
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:09,780
a lot of lives. And I'm so terrified of just blending into everybody else. And so these things

410
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:15,140
drive me. And sometimes I'm using negative things to drive me. Sometimes it's positive things. But

411
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:20,340
I guess the quote is, I don't know the exact quote, but

412
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:26,900
you do what needs to be done when it needs to be done, regardless of how you feel. That's it.

413
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:30,820
You map it out. You set the goal. You map it out. And then you do

414
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:37,140
what has to be done that day. And guys, you're most of the time not going to feel like doing it.

415
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:41,060
That's just the truth. When I got here on Saturday, I think I was sharing this at the beginning,

416
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:44,580
Porter, you missed it. But when I got here on Saturday, I had things that I missed on Friday

417
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:49,460
because I was traveling. And I told myself, if I'm going to miss those things, it's about three

418
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:52,500
hours worth of work. I'm either doing it on the plane or I'm doing it when I get to the hotel

419
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:58,740
before I do anything. And I was so tired. I had not slept crap. I got like 30 minutes to an hour

420
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:03,380
done on the plane, got here before I slept because the room wasn't that I cranked out the work.

421
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:10,820
And I wasn't inspired by it. I was tired. I was just like some of it. I was quite honestly

422
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:15,620
going through the motions, but I had to get certain things done. And every part of me wanted to,

423
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:18,980
I'll just do it on Monday. I'll push it till next week. I'm like, no, I've committed to doing this.

424
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:23,380
And then I woke up from my nap and I'm like, Hey, I got to go to the gym. And I didn't want to go to

425
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:28,820
the gym because I was supposed to go out at, you know, meet my friend at a certain time for this

426
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:33,060
event. But I'm like, dude, I've already committed to doing it. I've got certain fitness goals that

427
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:37,860
I've got to hit. And that's it. So get clear about your wild, think about the alternative,

428
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:43,540
and then just do it. It's just a habit of doing it, even if you don't feel like doing it, I think.

429
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:48,980
And it's, and it's also comes down to like, when you say you're going to do something like the night

430
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:52,820
before, it's like, you're so motivated to do something. And then the next day, it's like,

431
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:57,540
you don't feel like it. But if you keep telling, like, if you don't, if, like, if you don't do what

432
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:01,940
you tell yourself, you're going to do it. Like your confidence just goes down. It's so easier to like,

433
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:05,540
say, Oh, I didn't do that. Like, I'm not going to do that either. Or like, I'm not going to eat

434
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:08,340
better. Or like, I'm not going to work out. Like, if I didn't work out, I'm not going to eat good.

435
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:10,740
You know what I'm saying? It's like, every time that you tell yourself you're going to do something,

436
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:15,620
don't do it. It's like, you're shooting yourself in the foot. Like, you got to fall through with

437
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:18,820
what you're going to say you're going to do. And when you do that, it's like a domino effect.

438
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:21,860
It's like, you just want to keep checking things off your list and you feel really good about

439
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:25,940
yourself. These guys got, I told these guys at the beginning, they got out of read the slide edge,

440
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:31,620
dude. Dude, it's crazy guys. What, what, what, what, how, how far in are you?

441
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:38,340
I, I passed the part where, uh, the, the penny and the, the million dollars.

442
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:46,580
So are you, what percentage are you? Uh, 20, 25%. Nice. Phenomenal book guys. Um, I told you,

443
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:52,260
you can go type in slide edge PDF. You can get it for free at that. You could also go pay seven

444
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:58,580
bucks on Kindle or you could buy the, the, uh, the soft copy. I have all, I've read the book five

445
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:05,460
times. Um, it's a very simple book, but basically it just talks about this doing simple stuff.

446
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:08,500
And I'm telling you guys, and I said this before I even read this book this year,

447
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:15,060
I'd read the book in the past. My, my theme of 20, 25 is simplify and eliminate, right?

448
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:21,380
Get simple, eliminate the crap that doesn't matter. Okay. Get rid of all the extra fluff

449
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:26,820
and the meetings and the, this, that, and the rest and just focus on my core business

450
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:32,260
and growing it and being very simple and just doing it again and again and being really good at

451
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:36,500
it. And then I started reading this book and it just talks about, again, simplicity,

452
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:42,820
doing the little simple things every single day. And I promise you, they add up. So guys,

453
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:46,980
just one more plug, go check out this book. It's not my, not my, not my, I'm not getting

454
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:52,180
the commission on it, but it's a great book. Okay. Kevin Williams says business owner misses

455
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:57,540
the zoom call. What do you do? Porter, you've had this happen. Yeah, that's, that's a hard

456
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:00,900
conversation, especially when you think that they're solid. I mean, I would just message them,

457
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:05,700
say, Hey, Mr. Business owner. Like I, I see that you missed our call at such and such time. Like,

458
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:09,940
you know, I was really looking forward to chatting with you, but it seems like you're either,

459
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:13,700
you know, have enough work or maybe something came up. Like, please let me know so that we

460
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:17,780
can either reschedule or, you know, I just don't want to waste your time. So I think giving them

461
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:22,180
a little pullback, I mean, stuff does happen, like stuff emergencies do happen, but like very

462
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:26,420
rarely does it actually happen. Sometimes it's just, they're just blowing smoke, but you try to

463
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:30,580
give them the benefit of the doubt. Maybe they just need more time to think about it. But that's

464
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:34,980
what I like. This, this guy, he literally missed my zoom call and he was like, I'm out on the job

465
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:39,220
and I was like, well, dude, I got, I'm partnered with someone today because I did have another,

466
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:42,980
like I didn't have them scheduled, but I was like, I got to schedule with someone. I'd rather sit,

467
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:47,860
tell you, have you tell me no than for me to just be, you know, just waiting on the zoom call day.

468
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:52,580
So I sent him a message and then he basically fired back and was like, Hey, I watched your video.

469
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:57,220
Like, I only want to do a paper lead model and whatever. So I was like, you know what? It's,

470
00:41:57,220 --> 00:42:01,140
it's totally fine. Like, thanks for the conversation. We'll, we'll, we'll revisit this

471
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:06,020
later. So anyways, left it to that hook somebody else. But that's what I would say. Just have a,

472
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:10,820
have a conversation with them. I always try not to come out guns a blaze in the first text,

473
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:14,100
but like at the same time, you got to lay it across like, Hey, I'm looking to partner with

474
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:18,020
someone, whoever I partner with first, I'm going to go with. So if you want this, like let's

475
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:26,180
reschedule this for later today or, you know, really soon. Yeah. I think too guys, you need to

476
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:32,980
what's, what, how do I say this? Whatever you tolerate is what, what people will do to you,

477
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:38,100
right? It's, it's what you're going to receive. If I've sent you three leads

478
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:46,100
and I know you've quoted them, right. And you don't get on that call, dude, I'm, I'm pissed

479
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:49,780
and I'm not, I'm going to be a little more tactful than maybe what I'm saying right now, but

480
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:54,980
I'm, I'm not going to be super happy. I do this too. Like I've, like this happened about a week

481
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:58,420
and a half ago. This happens when with business owners happens with people that try to buy our

482
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:06,020
program. I think this, this was, I think again, about 10 days ago, we had this guy that whatever

483
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:12,340
he, he applied and then he traveled and whatever. And I, I told him, I said, I'm going to be on the

484
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:18,580
call just to say, hi, I want to meet you. And I literally had like planned my day. There was like

485
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:23,300
three, four calls that day that we had to do, but I shifted my calendar so I could be on the call.

486
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:28,740
And the guy, my team was like, yeah, he canceled. And I was like, give me this guy's number.

487
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:34,660
And I text him and I was like, Hey, this is Nick. I said, you missed the meeting. I don't, I'm not

488
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:37,860
sure why. And he's like, yeah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Gave me some reason. I said, look,

489
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:44,260
I said, I've, I literally, I moved my day around to be on this call. I said, the least you could

490
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:49,460
have done is like jumped on the call and give me an explanation, right? No pressure, but like,

491
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:53,300
that's not cool. That's how you do business. And the guy's like, yeah, you're right. Blah, blah,

492
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:59,300
blah. I just don't tolerate that. And so if somebody misses a meeting, it's, it's usually

493
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:02,740
indicative of how they're going to do business in the future. I'm not super interested in working

494
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:06,660
with people that can't get on a meeting. So, and I'll tell them that like, Hey, I've got other

495
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:11,700
people to work with. You're, your, your money spends the same money as freaking Susan's down

496
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:17,380
the street. And I'm like, I'm moving on. And guys, if you've sent them three leads, that's

497
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:20,020
going to sting a little bit. They're going to be like, Oh, I'm super sorry. Let me hop on.

498
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:24,100
Remember they need us more than we need them. Okay. Don't forget that.

499
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:32,820
Okay. Paul says, fake it till you make it. He says, kidding using the community sites

500
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:39,860
is legit. Oops. Being that you are using the same tactics and part of a network. He's talking about

501
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:44,900
using other people's sites. It's kind of for that first deal, by the way, if you are in digital

502
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:49,860
landlords, we have a thread in there. If you search for it with a bunch of people that have

503
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:55,220
listed their website and the name of the business owner and the deals, the deal size where you can

504
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:59,380
name drop some of these first deals to get your first day, you can name drop some of these other

505
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:03,860
deals. Okay. And that's true. That's part of the community that we should be leveraging. Okay.

506
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:07,940
Michael says, makes sense. That's, it's coming from my own personal issues of the consumer

507
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:16,100
needing proof, talking about his objection that he's getting about what needing, needing a reference

508
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:20,180
or seeing case studies or whatever. If you're sending leads, they shouldn't need it. That's the

509
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:28,740
fact. It's Kevin, the solid advice. Okay. Titus says, how can I find a business owner's name in

510
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:37,620
public records? The internet's wild guys. There's so many ways. If you just do some digging,

511
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:42,740
I will tell you that like we give specific strategies and techniques. I'm not sure if

512
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:47,220
Titus is inside digital lands. If you're in digital landlords and you go into module two, building

513
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:53,300
your list, we walk you through exact tactics. Okay. But if you're not, then some things that

514
00:45:53,300 --> 00:46:02,500
I would recommend is here's a little hack. Go to Google, the Google listing or the Facebook listing

515
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:07,940
and look at the reviews and start reading through the reviews. A lot of times in the reviews,

516
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:12,660
these small businesses, the business owner's name will be mentioned in the reviews, right?

517
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:18,740
The person will be like, we had a phenomenal time with Carlos was really great. He was really

518
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:24,260
professional. And then the next one's like, awesome job. Had a good exchange with Carlos. I see Carlos

519
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:28,420
like three, four times, right? So then I start going, okay, Carlos. So I type in the business

520
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:33,220
owner's name plus Carlos. And all of a sudden, there pops his name. Now I got his name. Then

521
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:36,820
I'm into Facebook. I'm looking at what he's into, blah, blah, blah. And I'm down the wormhole.

522
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:41,620
That's just one way of finding the business owner's name. But guys, there's so many tools out there.

523
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:50,980
You have freaking, I mean, with AI, unbelievable. By the way, I just barely got done. My buddy works

524
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:55,060
at Google. He's on one of the, he's on the AI, one of the AI teams at Google here in London.

525
00:46:55,700 --> 00:47:03,940
And the kind of money that Google is putting into AI right now is mind-bending. It is freaking

526
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:11,380
mind-bending because ChatGPT is posing a real threat to Google's main product, which is Google

527
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:14,980
Ads. I don't know if you guys knew this, but Google Ads, and I literally just confirmed this

528
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:20,900
with him. He's like, their main revenue stream is Google Ads, okay? So anything that's a threat to

529
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:26,100
Google Ads, they're going to try and protect. And so ChatGPT, where people are going in and asking

530
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:31,140
ChatGPT questions, it's pulling away from people searching in Google. So that's why they came out

531
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:38,660
with Gemini. Anyway, they're putting in a ridiculous amount of money into AI. Go and use these tools,

532
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:43,860
these AI tools. And I bet you, you're going to be able to find business owner's names really easy.

533
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:52,260
Okay. Just a little tip there. Okay. Paul says Botzel is a great scraping software that takes

534
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:55,940
all the business owners in the area and puts them in a spreadsheet. It leverages GMBs. That's great.

535
00:47:55,940 --> 00:48:00,740
Great little, I didn't know, I've never heard of that tool. Sounds awesome. Tidus said,

536
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:05,540
awesome. Appreciate it guys. Beautiful. Porter, your deal's at 430 today.

537
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:08,180
Yep. Got one at 430.

538
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:10,820
How much are you pitching it for?

539
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:17,460
I'm pitching it for 1500. This is going to be a different call. The owner is actually a woman,

540
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:23,940
which isn't a bad thing. I've just never quoted or pitched a woman yet as a fencing business owner.

541
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:31,140
It's a different sell. It's a softer sell. I will say you need to make sure your objections

542
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:35,940
are overcome upfront. Because as soon as you get to objection overcoming and you start trying to

543
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:41,780
do your techniques, your tie-downs and stuff, they're very quickly like, no, I don't want to

544
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:49,060
do it. Just as in door-to-door sales, whatever. I will tell you, we've worked with business

545
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:54,340
owners in the past that are women. We have one right now that's a client that is a woman. Great

546
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:57,860
business. Been working with them. I think they're in Colorado. I think I snuck one in the springs,

547
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:02,660
but not going to tell you about it. My hometown, dude.

548
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:22,100
Porter gets this deal. That's going to put Porter at $1,200 per month. For those of you that are

549
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:26,580
just starting, Porter, two and a half years ago, Porter didn't know how to run Google ads. He

550
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:31,780
didn't know how to build a website. He didn't know anything about SEO. He didn't even know how

551
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:37,300
to get on Zoom, nor did I. Literally. Yeah. Actually, we're still having problems with Zoom.

552
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:44,740
If you're struggling getting your first deal, you're over-complicating the process.

553
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:49,460
Literally just the other day, Porter, when he was telling me about this deal,

554
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:56,500
I asked him, I said, hey, is this somebody that got an existing website? Is this whatever he's

555
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:59,940
pre-selling? He's like, I'm just following the training. I'm like, yeah, go figure.

556
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:07,060
You get your first deal sometimes, guys, and you just think you're smarter than the process. The

557
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:12,180
process is the process for a reason. The process works. I use this example in the training.

558
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:19,300
It's like a perfect recipe for baking a cake. Sometimes we build a cake or we bake a cake,

559
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:26,420
aka we get a deal, and we think, hey, instead of adding the flour here, I'm going to wait until

560
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:31,620
it's mixed, and then after the milk, I'm going to put the flour in. You forget that there's a reason

561
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:36,500
why you put the flour in before you do the milk or whatever the case is. There's a reason why

562
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:41,780
I made the recipe exactly like I made the recipe is because it freaking works. If you don't think

563
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:46,820
I've tried putting in the chocolate chips at the beginning, then you're crazy because I've tried

564
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:50,900
all the different combinations, and I'm constantly trying to figure out, hey,

565
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:55,460
how can we make the same cake in a shorter period of time? How can we make the same cake

566
00:50:55,460 --> 00:51:01,620
with cheaper ingredients? That's why I spent 10,000 bucks on Google Ads from a guy who it

567
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:07,220
didn't even work. It didn't even help me, but I had to know, hey, can we improve in this area?

568
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:11,780
Didn't work, spent 10 grand, but that's the value you guys get from being inside the community.

569
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:19,220
So anyway, Porter, by the way, we also are pitching a deal today. I'm not doing it.

570
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:25,540
Francesca's doing it. It's not going to be huge. I think it's going to be probably between 500

571
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:32,420
and 1,000 bucks a month for excavation. I'm not sure I would recommend the niche. We had a referral.

572
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:38,660
We built it a few years ago, and the guy only had one piece of equipment, and I don't remember

573
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:43,060
exactly how we lost. We ended up only keeping it for three to six months. Websites have been

574
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:47,300
sitting there. It's pumping out a few leads. So me and Francesca were getting scrappy. We were like,

575
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:51,540
dude, we've got to sell some of these websites that are not making money. So we started doing

576
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:56,340
some Facebook little techniques, and sure enough, dude, we already sent a lead over on the weekend,

577
00:51:56,340 --> 00:52:00,340
guys coming in to meet with Francesca in person, and then she's going to send a screencast. So

578
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:09,460
we're going for an excavation deal, and then we're going for another deal that I can't tell

579
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:13,540
you guys the niche because I want to make sure it works, but it could be a very lucrative niche

580
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:19,140
that you guys have not thought of. So that's the plan. And by the way, I'm not doing any of these

581
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:23,940
deals myself. This is just me advising Francesca. So hopefully we snag at least one of these deals

582
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:32,900
this week. So anyway, I can't remember who said they were in. Was it Francesca who said he's in

583
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:39,060
UK? Let me double check. Francesca, if you're the one that's in the UK, dude, hit me up. I'm here for

584
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:42,820
another day or two. Let me just see if I can find that. I think it was him.

585
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:50,740
Yeah, he's in the UK. Beautiful. Yeah, shoot me a message on school. We'll talk about Google Ads.

586
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:56,740
I'm here. Maybe if I have time, we can meet up for coffee or something. But I am in London for

587
00:52:56,740 --> 00:53:01,860
the next day and a half and I'm going to Paris. So anyway, guys, one last thing real quick.

588
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:08,660
Starting next week, I'm going to be doing these Q&As slightly different. I'm either going to have

589
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:14,580
a theme, a Q&A theme. So I'll say, hey, this is all sales Q&A, or I'm going to do a little bit of a

590
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:21,380
training with a specific topic for the first half and then we can ask questions going off of that.

591
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:26,420
OK, so you can come with any questions that you want, but I'm going to try to send out a reminder

592
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:33,540
email Sunday night to remind you guys that, hey, Monday morning, we're going to be doing the live

593
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:37,220
get on it. And this is the topic that we're going to be training on. Then you guys can jump on and

594
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:42,500
we can go over that specific topic. So anyway, guys, that said, happy Monday, happy March. Go

595
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:46,900
over your goals. Review what happened in February. If you fell short, make your course corrections.

596
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:52,900
And we got one more month and quarter one is done. And then we got three quarters left in the game,

597
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:57,380
baby. That's it. So anyway, thanks for jumping on Porter. See you guys. Yep. We'll see you guys.
