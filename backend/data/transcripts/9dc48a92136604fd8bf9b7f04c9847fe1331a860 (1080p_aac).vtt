00:00.000 --> 00:02.420
You get to the end of the call. Everything's good

00:03.560 --> 00:08.120
Business owners like you're like, yo, I just need a credit card, you know, he's good to go. Oh, yeah

00:08.120 --> 00:12.160
Um, I don't do credit cards. I'm just gonna send you a PayPal

00:13.240 --> 00:15.240
I'm sure you take out the PayPal, right?

00:15.480 --> 00:20.480
And I know I've been I've been like it's been a while but I know a couple years ago

00:20.480 --> 00:23.620
I would have said yeah, I guess that's okay. He'd send me a PayPal

00:24.480 --> 00:29.840
You know what you should say and what you're gonna start saying is like no, I don't actually don't unfortunately you could say it

00:29.840 --> 00:33.840
However, you want but unfortunately, I don't take PayPal credit cards the only way I'm not gonna be chasing you around

00:33.840 --> 00:37.880
I got too many people I'm working with this is too my time is too valuable and so is yours

00:37.880 --> 00:41.220
I got to keep a credit card on file. That's a deal breaker. I apologize. I gotta keep a credit card on file

00:42.320 --> 00:48.320
Scariest shit to say right but I promise you they'll respect you and if they're actually sold they give you the credit card

00:48.640 --> 00:52.520
Period. I have a guy I kid you not have a client right now

00:53.560 --> 00:57.400
that he signed a deal before the New Year and

00:58.400 --> 01:03.920
I said I he signed it we're good to go and I sent him a credit card authorization and he said hey

01:03.920 --> 01:09.840
Can I just give you my bank account and dude? I have I hate bank account stuff because then on stripe when the payment declines

01:10.520 --> 01:14.080
It's this whole thing and it takes a while to get paid. I just don't like it. I

01:14.520 --> 01:20.520
Want to get paid today. I said we don't take we don't take bank account. Sorry, and I kid you not

01:20.520 --> 01:22.520
I walked away from that deal. I

01:22.720 --> 01:27.160
Literally told him that like I can't take anything besides a credit card period and

01:27.760 --> 01:31.880
It took another four weeks almost a full month of

01:32.680 --> 01:37.240
Me I just I wouldn't take it and it took four more weeks before I finally got his credit card

01:37.240 --> 01:40.520
He went to the bank and got a card

01:41.200 --> 01:45.800
Just so he could pay for leads. Okay, so he wasn't bullshit. I thought he was lying

01:45.800 --> 01:48.340
He's like I don't have a credit card for this business. I want to put under this business

01:48.740 --> 01:53.940
He wouldn't got a credit card because I just my time is too valuable. I'm not gonna mess with it

01:53.940 --> 01:58.680
So that's an example people are gonna ask. Hey, you know, I don't I don't like giving out my credit card

01:59.140 --> 02:01.140
can I just give you my PayPal or

02:01.900 --> 02:05.860
Or this one you get more often. Yeah, I don't I don't want to have my credit card on file

02:05.860 --> 02:07.500
Can you just send me the invoice?

02:07.500 --> 02:10.500
Wait, will you just send me the invoice? Sorry? I got a itch on that

02:10.500 --> 02:15.180
Well, you guys just send me the invoice every month and I'll just pay it now. Sorry. We just have it

02:15.180 --> 02:19.740
This is how I respond so are we just have it in our system automatically like keep in mind

02:19.740 --> 02:23.860
I'm doing this with 50 60 companies. I can't go in and do this every single month

02:23.980 --> 02:28.820
So I I'll send you the first one as the invoice, but after that it's gonna automatically bill cool

02:28.820 --> 02:33.760
Cuz then what happens is that once they fill in the information, it's gonna lock their card and file and I just I'm straight with them
