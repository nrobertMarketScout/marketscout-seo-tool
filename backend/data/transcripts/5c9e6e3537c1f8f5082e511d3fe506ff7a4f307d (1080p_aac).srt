1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,400
You transfer each lead every time.

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,960
And in the beginning, yes, the three to five phone calls.

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,320
That's the, that's part of the setup that Nick's talks about.

4
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:08,800
You have to transfer every lead live.

5
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,080
You know, you have to value that lead.

6
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:10,920
Yep.

7
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:11,680
I agree.

8
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:15,360
And, and the thing is, you guys think it'll be a pain to do the live transfers,

9
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,980
but I promise you like B before he was trying to sell the site and he was

10
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,600
sending handfuls and droves of leads.

11
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,060
And then it was wondering why the hell he couldn't close it.

12
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,920
Now he's only has to send three to four leads over a 24 hour period.

13
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,180
And he's locking down $40,000 deals.

14
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,140
It's because he can control the whole process, make sure the

15
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:35,020
client's answering, make sure the lead is good, make sure the lead answers.

16
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,940
And he can literally like hand just like the Costco sample strategy in the module.

17
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:45,140
You can literally force feed the, the, the, the quiche into their mouth.

18
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,020
Like they can't walk around the corner and throw it away because you're

19
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,580
doing it, you're handing it off.

20
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:49,940
Right.
