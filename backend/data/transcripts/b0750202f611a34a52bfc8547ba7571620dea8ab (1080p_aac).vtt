00:00.000 --> 00:01.000
Let's get into it.

00:01.000 --> 00:13.740
Before we jump into it, guys, I want to share with you a quick story.

00:13.740 --> 00:16.500
When I was doing door-to-door sales, and I promise I'm going to make this really quick,

00:16.500 --> 00:19.660
when I was doing door-to-door sales, they would literally drop us off in neighborhoods

00:19.660 --> 00:21.060
and we would just start knocking doors.

00:21.060 --> 00:27.020
And I am not the sharpest tool in the shed, as they say, but I learned really quickly

00:27.220 --> 00:32.220
If I would just knock on the homes of people who already had security systems, so like

00:32.220 --> 00:39.160
ADT or Monotronics, these different companies, I would look for those security signs.

00:39.160 --> 00:41.980
When I knocked on these houses, in the beginning I didn't do it on purpose, and I knocked on

00:41.980 --> 00:46.260
these houses, it was a really different sale, it was a completely different thing.

00:46.260 --> 00:49.980
I didn't have to convince them that they should get security, I didn't have to convince them

00:49.980 --> 00:51.460
that security was a good idea.

00:51.460 --> 00:56.100
I didn't have them telling me, oh, I have a gun, I have Smith & Wesson, I have a dog,

00:56.100 --> 00:57.100
it's a safe neighbor.

00:57.100 --> 01:02.340
I didn't have these objections because they were already paying for security.

01:02.340 --> 01:05.860
So what was cool is I would knock on these doors, and my pitch was very simple, it was

01:05.860 --> 01:09.340
like, I would knock and I would say, hey, my name's Nick, blah blah blah, I'm with this

01:09.340 --> 01:13.860
company right here, I know you're already paying for XYZ service and I already know

01:13.860 --> 01:17.220
how much you're paying, what we're doing for everybody in the neighborhood is we're just

01:17.220 --> 01:19.980
upgrading them, we're giving them a camera, we're giving them a door lock, we're giving

01:19.980 --> 01:24.140
them this, we're upgrading their system, it's the same price per month, roughly, and we're

01:24.140 --> 01:27.420
going to put you on a phone app, can I step inside and show you what this looks like on

01:27.420 --> 01:28.420
paper?

01:28.420 --> 01:30.940
And that was it, and I was right inside the house, we were talking numbers.

01:30.940 --> 01:34.380
It wasn't this big emotional sale, it wasn't this long, dry-out thing, it was very, very

01:34.380 --> 01:35.940
cut and dry.

01:35.940 --> 01:40.700
And so what it did, and this is what I want to talk about, is this collapsed time.

01:40.700 --> 01:44.780
I was trying, every single year when I was doing this job, I was like, how do I make

01:44.780 --> 01:45.780
more sales?

01:45.780 --> 01:46.780
How do I make more sales?

01:46.780 --> 01:51.420
And I didn't have the leverage of the internet or any of these tools, it was literally sweat

01:51.420 --> 01:52.420
equity.

01:52.540 --> 01:55.600
How can I get more deals done in less amount of time?

01:55.600 --> 01:59.700
And the way that I was able to do this is by collapsing time, and it was by going after

01:59.700 --> 02:01.340
these type of customers.

02:01.340 --> 02:05.260
Guys, there's three things I want to share here as to why we're going to target people

02:05.260 --> 02:07.620
that are already paying for ads.

02:07.620 --> 02:11.940
Number one is when you call people and you target people that are already paying for

02:11.940 --> 02:17.520
ads, already sold on what you're selling, you only need to make one sale.

02:17.520 --> 02:21.300
What I mean by that is you don't need to call a business owner and convince them that, hey,

02:21.980 --> 02:23.980
Mr. Business Owner, advertising is a good idea.

02:23.980 --> 02:26.740
You don't need to do that because they already know they're already paying for it.

02:26.740 --> 02:30.940
So what it is, all you need to do is you need to let them know, hey, Mr. Business Owner,

02:30.940 --> 02:32.660
here's why you should work with me.

02:32.660 --> 02:35.800
Here's why my product is better than what you're paying for, or not even better than,

02:35.800 --> 02:38.240
but also a good fit, okay?

02:38.240 --> 02:39.940
So you only need to make one sale.

02:39.940 --> 02:44.620
Second reason is you're going to have to talk to less people to get deals.

02:44.620 --> 02:47.820
You're not going to have to go through so many people to find a deal.

02:47.820 --> 02:51.420
When you just go and you're targeting and you're prospecting and you just go to Google

02:51.420 --> 02:55.700
and you type in concrete Minneapolis, you're going to have to go through a lot of business

02:55.700 --> 03:00.860
owners to find people that are sold on your product and then sold on you, and it's going

03:00.860 --> 03:01.860
to take a long time.

03:01.860 --> 03:06.420
But when you're specifically targeting people who are already sold, you're going to get

03:06.420 --> 03:11.220
a deal a lot quicker, and you're going to have to go through a lot less heartache, headache,

03:11.220 --> 03:13.380
pain to get to that deal.

03:13.380 --> 03:15.300
Third reason is this, guys.

03:15.300 --> 03:19.940
When you're talking to people that are already sold on what you're selling, they conceptually

03:19.940 --> 03:25.460
understand, okay, I pay for advertising because it's going to get me more business, I understand

03:25.460 --> 03:29.860
what leads are, and so what this does is it allows you to collapse time.

03:29.860 --> 03:33.820
They conceptually understand the concept of paying for advertising, and so these deals

03:33.820 --> 03:35.140
tend to go a lot quicker.

03:35.140 --> 03:38.160
When you're talking to somebody who's never spent money on ads, they've never spent money

03:38.160 --> 03:44.220
on Google Ads, Home Advisor, Angie's List, et cetera, you have to explain everything.

03:44.220 --> 03:47.060
Hey, Mr. Business Owner, this is what cost per click is.

03:47.060 --> 03:50.100
Hey, Mr. Business Owner, this is how a lead is, or this is what a lead is.

03:50.100 --> 03:52.100
Hey, Mr. Business Owner, this is what the customer sees.

03:52.100 --> 03:54.500
Hey, Mr. Business Owner, this is why we're better than Google Ads.

03:54.500 --> 03:58.860
But when they're already paying for advertising, you don't have to do all that.

03:58.860 --> 04:02.500
They conceptually understand it, and these deals tend to go quicker.

04:02.500 --> 04:04.420
So guys, let's go ahead and build the list.
