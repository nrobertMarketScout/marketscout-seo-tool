1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,840
Okay, we should be live.

2
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:12,000
Or getting ready to be live.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Awesome.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
All right.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Okay, we should be live.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I think we're live.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Let's check it out.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Cool.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We are here.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
All right. Hey guys we're here we're live.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Let's get this going.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Okay.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It should be good to be able to watch that.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm going to start tagging everybody.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Go from there. Can you still hear me here?

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Yeah.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Can you hear me?

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Yeah, I can hear you.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Okay.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Okay.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Let's get everybody.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So we're going to tag everybody and let people kind of pop on

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
here.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
And we'll wait till we have three or four people.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Sometimes you only have five or six people, but.

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
We'll just see what we get today.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Yeah.

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Then we get started once people start popping on.

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Okay.

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I think we're good to go.

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Okay.

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
So,

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I don't know if you've ever done one of these,

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
but if you watch both,

35
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
there's a huge delay between what you and I are doing and then what

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
people.

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
See or respond with on Facebook. So it's kind of a trip for me.

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Sometimes.

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So.

40
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Yeah.

41
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Yeah.

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
If I seem like I'm saying something that was like something you and I

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
talked about like five, 10 seconds ago, it's because.

44
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Okay.

45
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,000
All right. We've got a few people coming on.

46
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
We're going to be, um,

47
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
kind of helping you guys out and getting a jumpstart on transferring

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
and, uh, we're not transferring, but, uh,

49
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Setting up search campaigns like we've talked about.

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Um,

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So that's kind of going to be what we're doing today.

52
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Um,

53
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
we'll let a few more people get on board here and we'll get started.

54
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Obviously this video will stay on Facebook.

55
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So there shouldn't be a problem with that.

56
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Um,

57
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Everyone will be able to get it.

58
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
We're trying to set up a simple search campaign for you guys

59
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
to be able to use on your one pagers.

60
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
And we're going to try to make it.

61
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Um,

62
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
As kind of fast and simple as we can.

63
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
We're probably not going to, uh,

64
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
dive deep into a lot of the explanations.

65
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
We're just going to kind of show you how to do it.

66
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So you could do it on some of yours.

67
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Um,

68
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And we'll take a few questions as we go.

69
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
But the goal is to kind of have this up and running.

70
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Um,

71
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
let it sit there on the Facebook group and then you guys can kind of

72
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
jump in and take a look at it.

73
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Uh, right now we, we've done some longer formatted ones, um,

74
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
that are being edited and kind of chopped up to make it a little,

75
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
uh,

76
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
easier to digest.

77
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And then what we'll do is as these things roll out and we get more

78
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
questions and stuff,

79
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
we'll see where we need to explain more and stuff like that.

80
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So we'll probably do like a more polished, uh,

81
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
version of everything at some point. Um,

82
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
but we want to get you guys going on with stuff and at least give you

83
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
something to work with. And then we'll just keep,

84
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
we'll just keep polishing it up, making it easier for you guys. So,

85
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
uh, all right. Well, with that, um,

86
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
we'll let our special guests come on. Francesca, are you there?

87
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yes.

88
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I don't know how special, but I'm here.

89
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
All right. And for those that don't know, Francesca is, uh,

90
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
why don't you go ahead and introduce yourself and, uh,

91
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
credential speak for yourself.

92
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Yeah. So I've been working with Nick for,

93
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'm going to my fifth year and I'm running like the agency side for

94
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
him pretty much.

95
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm sure some people have talked to me on the application as well.

96
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So when they first applied,

97
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'm the one that answers those as well for anyone that,

98
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
you know, has joined since, um, April, I would say.

99
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Some people shouldn't know me or at least I've heard my voice.

100
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Okay. Good. Good. Um, so anyway, so just for you guys, um,

101
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
so Francesca kind of runs, uh,

102
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
most of Nick's ads and stuff like that, like she said, she's kind of the, uh,

103
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
she's the one who makes sure that place runs and keeps going. Um,

104
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
so we've been working together for probably like the last five, six months.

105
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And, uh, we've been testing a lot of stuff, seeing what works,

106
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
what's not working.

107
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
And so that's what we're doing today is to try to show you guys some,

108
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
um, simple search campaigns. So with that,

109
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
we've about seven people on we're going to go ahead and start rolling.

110
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
And we're going to see how well this goes. So,

111
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
so bear with us. And, um, we, to save some time,

112
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
we've preloaded a few things. Um, I'm just going to touch on them.

113
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
They're pretty simple things that I preloaded.

114
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It's just so you guys don't have to watch me typing and things like that.

115
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
So it's just to save a little bit of time on your end.

116
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
So you don't have to watch typing and things like that. Okay.

117
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Um, like that reminds me before we get started here,

118
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I forgot I got to live this up to give me one second, guys.

119
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I just want to get this going here.

120
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Okay.

121
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Sorry. I forgot to bring up the keyword planner.

122
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
All right.

123
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Yeah.

124
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
So.

125
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Yeah.

126
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Let me just, let me just plug this in real quick.

127
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Okay.

128
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
And I'm going to show you guys what I'm working on. I've just, uh,

129
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
like I said, we're just trying to save some time and I'm just going to show

130
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
you how to, how we do some things and just have to set some certain stuff

131
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
up.

132
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Okay.

133
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Okay.

134
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I think we're ready to go here.

135
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
All right. Cool.

136
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
All right.

137
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
So I'm just going to show you how to save some time.

138
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Okay.

139
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Okay.

140
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I think we're ready to go here.

141
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
All right.

142
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Cool.

143
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
All right, everybody.

144
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
So we're going to go ahead and get started here.

145
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Let me go ahead and share my screen.

146
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I think away we go.

147
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
All right.

148
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Oh yeah.

149
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You see everything now.

150
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Okay.

151
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
All right.

152
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So here we go, guys.

153
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
We are going to hop in and, um,

154
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Set up a search campaign today for you guys.

155
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Um, there's two different types of main search campaigns.

156
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Um, there's one called, uh, like a call only, like a call ad.

157
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And then there's the standard, like webs, uh,

158
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
website traffic or like a, like a click to call ad where somebody clicks on

159
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
your website and then they click over.

160
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Um, and do that. So we're going to, um,

161
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
we're going to set up a call only ad because that's a more simple one to

162
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
set up. It's very similar as you guys will see in more training,

163
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
but it's a, it's an easy one to set up.

164
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Um, and it gets the phone ringing fairly fast.

165
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
So that's what we're going to show you guys today.

166
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Um, with that, I'm going to, I'm going to get on my phone real quick.

167
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Uh, or Francesca, can you see the Facebook group on your end?

168
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Are you able to monitor that?

169
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I am not on Facebook. Let me, let me go in real quick.

170
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Okay. That way, if you see some comments come up or something since.

171
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Yeah.

172
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Okay.

173
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
If you see any comments, just let me know.

174
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Okay. So guys, so what we're doing, so we're in the, uh, MCC account here.

175
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Uh, we went up and we set up, you guys,

176
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
this is all the same as the trainings we went and we set up a new sub

177
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
account.

178
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Um, so we're setting up, uh,

179
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
this is a client that reached out to you guys.

180
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You guys didn't do a prospecting for it.

181
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
This is an inbound person that came to, uh, Nick's, uh,

182
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
agency and wants them to help them get leads for duck cleaning in the

183
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
New Orleans, uh, area, um, in region.

184
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
So we're going to set up that campaign today for you guys.

185
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And you guys get to kind of watch how this is going to go.

186
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
So what we did is we set up the sub account and we go to,

187
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
we click on that and now we're here in this screen.

188
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
So that's the same as the training. You guys get to this spot.

189
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Now you want to set up a new campaign.

190
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
So click on new campaign.

191
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Okay.

192
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Since we want to focus on a call only ad.

193
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Okay.

194
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
We're going to use, take advantage of the leads.

195
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
We're going to select leads.

196
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Call.

197
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And then we're going to click.

198
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Right here at search.

199
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Okay.

200
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
We're going to do website visits.

201
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It's going to ask.

202
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
For our.

203
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Our website.

204
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Um, do you know if the, uh, has it been HTTPS yet?

205
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Does it have that SSL on it?

206
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Yeah.

207
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Let me try that.

208
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Okay.

209
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And then we're going to go here.

210
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
And it's going to give us these four different, um,

211
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
lead conversion goals.

212
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
And we're going to click right here.

213
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Phone calls from your ads.

214
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
And then I just like the name of this.

215
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
So we're just going to call this.

216
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
No.

217
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Okay.

218
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I'm going to ask you, do you want to focus on conversions or clicks?

219
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Um,

220
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You can, you can set up conversions if you want.

221
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I kind of like clicks right now.

222
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Um, but.

223
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
It's not a huge issue one way or the other,

224
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
but I prefer to do clicks may just be the way I was trained to do it or

225
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
whatever.

226
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Okay. And now what we want and something for search campaigns is we

227
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
can set.

228
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Um,

229
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Um,

230
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
The reason for this is like,

231
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
You don't want to get into a bidding war where you're doing like $30,

232
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
like keyword clicks or something like that.

233
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Okay.

234
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Okay.

235
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
All right.

236
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Love you.

237
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Um,

238
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
And sorry.

239
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Yeah.

240
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
And then,

241
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
so what we're going to do here is we're going to go here and we're going

242
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
to set a maximum cost per click.

243
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
And you guys are going to ask me.

244
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Okay.

245
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
So what I did is I took our top four keywords.

246
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Um, I went into keyword planner.

247
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
So if you guys go to tools and setting.

248
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You, you hit keyword planner.

249
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Okay.

250
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
And I paste it in our top four key keywords here.

251
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I set my location up for the new Orleans, uh, area.

252
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Okay. And it's given me.

253
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Um,

254
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
And then it's given me the low range and the top, uh, high end range.

255
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Okay.

256
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
And you can see here, there's a pretty good, I mean, look at this one.

257
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
It's like a $15 difference between the low and the high end.

258
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
And stuff like that.

259
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Uh, this one's, you know, from seven 50 to $24.

260
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
So, um,

261
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
they know that air duct cleaning is a very, uh,

262
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
expensive competitive niche now, especially like post COVID.

263
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Where people are more and more into it.

264
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Okay.

265
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Okay.

266
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Um, so.

267
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
We're, um,

268
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,000
We're we're looking at this.

269
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Um,

270
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
what we want to do is we want to be on the high end of our top of page

271
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
bid.

272
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
But because these are so, so, so, so high.

273
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Um,

274
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
we just got to try to figure out like a happy medium for right now.

275
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Okay. And we can always adjust it.

276
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
But kind of looking at like, I'm seeing a lot of like.

277
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
So we're looking at the top of the page bid.

278
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Okay.

279
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
And I'm not going to go into the top of the page bid.

280
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I'm not going to look into the top of the page bid,

281
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
but it's definitely a high end.

282
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
So I'll just go for $4.

283
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
But I look on the low end and I'm seeing, you know,

284
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
seven, eight, nine, $10, stuff like that.

285
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
So what we'll do is to kind of play it safe.

286
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
What we'll do is we'll set something.

287
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
That's a little under those really high ends,

288
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
but it's definitely way over the low end.

289
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
So for right now, what we'll do is we'll choose 13.

290
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
76.

291
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Okay.

292
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
There's really no science behind that, but.

293
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
We're going to.

294
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
That's the maximum we're willing to do for a click. Okay.

295
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,500
I'm just showing you guys how you set this up.

296
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,540
Obviously, do we want to set up ads in New Orleans?

297
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,500
Probably not, right?

298
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,460
But this is a client that reached out to them

299
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:30,360
that wants to do business, that's already paying them.

300
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,860
Francesca and them know what they're doing.

301
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,940
They already told them like, hey, it's an expensive area.

302
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,060
It's going to do duh.

303
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,580
Like they set up a big contract.

304
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:40,980
They got enough room to play here in this space, okay?

305
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,620
But for you guys, if you guys are seeing

306
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,100
those big variations,

307
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,540
you just kind of want to choose something,

308
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:49,120
but you definitely don't want to be on this low end, okay?

309
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,040
You want to be somewhere in the middle.

310
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,400
If everything's equal and these are like $6, $7 higher,

311
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:59,440
what I recommend then is doing one penny higher.

312
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,820
That's my recommendation for that.

313
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,980
Okay, enough of that.

314
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:07,720
Okay, now we go here, we hit next, right?

315
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,800
And this is where they're going to try to trick you again.

316
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:13,280
But now we finally get to opt out of the display network.

317
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,220
And then they hide Google search partners

318
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,740
right here at search network.

319
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,740
So I've done this sometimes where I think I'm good

320
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,060
and I forget to uncheck this.

321
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,040
So you want to uncheck these two right here

322
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,580
because you only want to play on the search network now.

323
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,280
I don't care about these other ones, right?

324
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,260
We want to save, we want to get rid of those clicks, okay?

325
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:31,980
Now it's going to ask you for a location.

326
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,780
So we're going to say enter another location.

327
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:38,860
Now this particular client has some particular locations.

328
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,260
So what we're going to do

329
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,480
is we're going to click advanced search, okay?

330
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:47,080
And then what it's going to do is it's going to give us,

331
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,440
because of the towns that they want to target,

332
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,680
we've already kind of looked at this.

333
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,280
So we're going to choose radius, okay?

334
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,860
So we're going to do a radius.

335
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:59,520
I'm going to do about five miles

336
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,120
in between each of these cities.

337
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,800
And we can always go back and adjust this later.

338
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,160
So I'm looking for Gonzales, Louisiana.

339
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,140
And I can bump this out to more.

340
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,860
We're going to keep that at five.

341
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:16,320
And we're just going to kind of see how this,

342
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,460
how this works for us here.

343
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:38,940
Okay.

344
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:43,500
And again, we can go back later and adjust these,

345
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,540
but just to kind of give you guys an idea

346
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,940
of how we're setting this thing up a little bit in this area.

347
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:52,300
And the reason why we're doing a radius

348
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:56,620
and not like an exact city is because

349
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,500
when you get on the outskirts of New Orleans,

350
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,040
it's a little more rural,

351
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,580
but obviously the city of New Orleans

352
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:06,100
is going to be a lot more dense.

353
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,440
So we're going to choose these here.

354
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,960
And then, oh, it's all right.

355
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,800
We got the one more.

356
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,640
We got it.

357
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,480
Hang on a second.

358
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,880
I have to figure out the spelling of that one again.

359
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,800
They'll chase, no wonder why it's not.

360
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,640
I don't know.

361
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,800
All right, let me see that.

362
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,840
There it is.

363
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,720
Okay.

364
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,880
Now see how that kind of gets in here.

365
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:47,880
Like we can reduce that one if we find that this is too dense,

366
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:48,880
but we're going to leave it for now.

367
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,640
So these are going to be our main locations

368
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,880
that the customer wants to target.

369
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,200
So they actually want to kind of target

370
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,160
around New Orleans, which is good.

371
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,680
Okay, so that's how we're setting that up.

372
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,080
And then you want to click here where it says location.

373
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,040
Click here where it says location options.

374
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,240
The default is going to be presence or interest, okay?

375
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,320
This is going to show you,

376
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,000
this is going to be wasteful ad spend.

377
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,400
So we want to make sure that we select people

378
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,320
that are in or regularly in those targeted locations

379
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:17,440
because that's where homeowners and business owners are.

380
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,720
Not tourists, not people driving through, stuff like that.

381
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,880
So we always want to check that.

382
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:25,800
It just helps save for better click searches.

383
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,480
English is our language.

384
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,720
Audience segments, we don't need to really worry about

385
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,840
for what we're doing.

386
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,240
We want to go here and more settings.

387
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,920
These are the default.

388
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,760
So we can tweak some of these or we can leave them the same.

389
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:46,760
I prefer to let Google best optimize whatever,

390
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,600
like the best performing ads

391
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,680
instead of me having to try to control it

392
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,520
because it just takes too much time and maintenance

393
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,480
and stuff like that.

394
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,800
So the default is this.

395
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,400
That's what we want to make sure.

396
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,800
We're going to start today with no end date.

397
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,440
You can do a different schedule.

398
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,800
And because it's a call ad,

399
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,360
we're going to set that up like that

400
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,440
because we don't want calls coming in

401
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,280
like super late at night, right?

402
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,920
So we'll probably start it at like 7 a.m.

403
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,920
and we'll run these till probably,

404
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,840
it was almost 6.30, sorry.

405
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:20,200
And we'll probably run these till like maybe like seven.

406
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,040
That'd probably be a decent time.

407
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:25,560
And then that's going to be that for there.

408
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,120
You can see that there's obviously more settings.

409
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,680
These things we're not worried about yet.

410
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,880
So we go here.

411
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,560
Okay, now it's going to want to run our ad group.

412
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,920
It has right here, it gives us our website.

413
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:48,240
Okay, now Google is going to try to give you

414
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,880
a bunch of keywords in here.

415
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,880
Okay, when there's nothing over here,

416
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,200
these are considered broad match.

417
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,840
So we're going to go ahead and type in the keywords.

418
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,640
We're going to type in the quotes as a phrase match

419
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,360
and the brackets are exact match.

420
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,240
We only want to use phrase match for right now.

421
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,720
So to speed things up, we took the keywords

422
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,320
that Francesca gave us.

423
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,000
We went to this website called AdWordsWrapper.

424
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,960
Okay, I pasted my keywords in here.

425
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,080
I told Google to wrap it.

426
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,080
I'm going to go down here

427
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,280
and you can see the different types of keywords,

428
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,680
labels right here.

429
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,000
I'm going to go to the phrase match one.

430
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,760
Don't push the copy button

431
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,000
because for some reason it doesn't copy it.

432
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I don't know why.

433
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,960
I hate when the menu moves in front of you.

434
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,160
Okay, hold on.

435
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,320
Maybe a little maneuvering.

436
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,720
Okay, there we go.

437
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,960
Zoom thing was in my way.

438
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,800
Okay, I'm going to copy all these.

439
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,640
I'm going to delete.

440
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,520
And then I'm going to paste my own.

441
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,880
Okay, so this is from our own research.

442
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,720
These are the ones I want to run phrase match on

443
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,240
and we're going to go with that.

444
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,000
Okay, now we're going to get into setting up our ad.

445
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,960
Now, because this is a call only ad,

446
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,960
we only get a couple of headlines

447
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,400
and a couple of,

448
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,200
oh look, it's going to give us more this time.

449
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,040
Awesome.

450
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,280
So we're just going to fill it out

451
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,160
with like just a few basic ones

452
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,280
and then just to save time here,

453
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:25,680
but you can optimize it as much as it'll give you, okay?

454
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,680
So we're going to go here.

455
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,800
We have our website.

456
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:35,280
You can kind of see that it kind of started auto-filling it,

457
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,640
but we're going to stick to like what we're trained on, right?

458
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,240
So, right, so what we're trained on is, right,

459
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,120
city and service main keywords.

460
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:48,120
So we're going to do New Orleans.

461
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,720
We're going to see if I can get,

462
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,600
let's see if I can get, oh, look at that, perfect.

463
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,640
Okay, what's the next one?

464
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,960
Get a hundred percent free, right?

465
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,800
So,

466
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,160
that'd be awesome, a hundred percent free.

467
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,800
Can you just put estimate?

468
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,360
Well, it's only for 30 characters, so.

469
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,440
Yeah, just like get a hundred percent free estimate

470
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,120
without the duck cleaning.

471
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,360
Yeah, I think that's what we're going to have to do.

472
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,000
I tried though, okay.

473
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,840
Yeah, I know.

474
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,680
Okay.

475
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,440
Dryer vent cleaning.

476
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,600
Let me see what I should just do this.

477
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,680
Okay.

478
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:14,280
Okay, so we're going to just do these four for now.

479
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:17,040
We'll come back another time and we'll fill this out.

480
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,040
We want this to kind of get up to like the good

481
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,720
or the strong range eventually.

482
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,320
So the descriptions, right,

483
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,520
we're just going to stick to what the training,

484
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,560
it still works, right?

485
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,480
So we go here, we copy that.

486
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,800
So we're going to do,

487
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,080
we're going to play with that a little bit.

488
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,760
So we specialize in.

489
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,760
And like Jeff said,

490
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,280
you want to complete as many headlines as they give you.

491
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,840
We're just doing it quickly.

492
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,000
So we're not wasting everyone's time,

493
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,600
but you want to, obviously if you're doing it yourself,

494
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,080
same with the descriptions, you have four.

495
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,840
So we're just probably going to fill out two,

496
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,040
but you want to complete as much as you can.

497
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,320
Okay.

498
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,000
That's probably good there.

499
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,760
And then we're going to do, right, we're going to do this.

500
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,880
Okay, and again, guys, we're doing this

501
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,840
because we're trying to make this right

502
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,680
as down and dirty as possible.

503
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,320
So,

504
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,600
I'm going to see, I think I can get,

505
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,440
if I can get that in, right,

506
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,320
I might be able to get cleaning on that.

507
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,160
It's in the area.

508
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,480
Cool.

509
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,320
All right.

510
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,360
So we're going to leave those there, okay?

511
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,760
Your local, affordable,

512
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,880
professional air ducting experts.

513
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,720
Okay, great.

514
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,240
Okay.

515
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,280
And then from there, like that's kind of that.

516
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,840
Okay, again, we'll come back in here

517
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,280
and we'll clean these up and add more

518
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,640
to increase the strength, okay?

519
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,160
So just for time for you guys,

520
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,480
we don't need to spend time doing that right now,

521
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:20,320
but we'll do that later after the live.

522
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,480
So I'm going to hit done.

523
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:26,120
You don't need to worry about all those call-outs

524
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,680
and site links and all that stuff.

525
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,040
We'll get into that stuff later,

526
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,080
but don't worry about that for right now.

527
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,960
Now it's going to ask for our daily budget.

528
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,280
Now it doesn't give you the recommendation anymore, right?

529
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:41,200
So I'm going to move us here.

530
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,400
Zoom so I can see here.

531
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,480
So what we'll do is we'll click here.

532
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:51,640
So obviously some of the clicks were like high up there.

533
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:55,160
So we're going to see what it does at $25.

534
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,240
We're going to see what it gives me.

535
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:01,760
So at $25, it's telling me I can expect about 22 clicks.

536
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,000
It's going to cost me about $160 a week

537
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,920
and this is my average CPC.

538
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,600
So that's not terrible, right?

539
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,920
If you're getting that many clicks

540
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,760
and potential calls a week,

541
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:14,240
obviously if I went up to like say $55,

542
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,560
it's probably going to give me,

543
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:19,000
looks like it's giving me the same results, okay?

544
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:23,800
Let's try like $75, let's just see what it does.

545
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,640
So that's great.

546
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,880
That if that's all good,

547
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,440
we're going to try to bump it down to 20

548
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,320
and see what it does, only 21.

549
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,880
So like, that's not bad.

550
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,400
Let's see if I do 15 and it tells me that's too low.

551
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,200
Okay, so we're going to start at $20

552
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,160
because that seems to be a decent amount, right?

553
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,280
I think anybody would be happy with

554
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,280
that many clicks per week for right now.

555
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,120
And let me move this back up here.

556
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,760
The optimization score at first,

557
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,840
don't worry about that.

558
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:58,960
That's something that I'll kind of explain in a second,

559
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,760
but don't worry about this right now.

560
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,280
It can get better if you add better headlines

561
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,760
or more headlines and more descriptions and things like that.

562
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,360
So we'll fix that later.

563
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,200
And we're going to do another training series

564
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,040
where we'll go over that,

565
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,320
but don't worry about that for right now.

566
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,960
Okay, so now we go here.

567
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,400
It's going to, we're going to just double check everything

568
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,560
that it's a search campaign.

569
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:25,960
Sometimes if you forgot to uncheck one of those boxes,

570
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:30,400
it'll tell you search display and other stuff.

571
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,040
We're doing leads, phone call leads,

572
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,840
we're maximizing clicks.

573
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,600
We're on the Google search network, none of the others.

574
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,160
We have our different locations,

575
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,240
our language, everything here.

576
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:49,000
All day is 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. and $20 a day.

577
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,640
And we're like, cool, let's go ahead and publish it.

578
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:56,680
So this ad now goes into what's called a policy review.

579
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:03,040
Okay, this will take a couple of days.

580
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,320
Okay, and then it should go live.

581
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,280
And then once it goes live,

582
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:11,160
you're going to be in this thing called bid strategy learning.

583
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:14,120
Okay, and this takes about five days.

584
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:17,960
So it takes about seven days for like the ad

585
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,120
to get really warmed up.

586
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,000
So two days to go through policy review

587
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,520
and then about five or six days

588
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,040
of like actually running to do that.

589
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,360
So, but this gets you up and running

590
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:36,240
and you'll get, you'll definitely gonna be reducing

591
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,760
those really cheap crappy clicks on YouTube,

592
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,520
search partners and stuff like that.

593
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,200
So those are gonna go away.

594
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,040
What you're gonna see is you're gonna see

595
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,840
a lot less impressions because we're only on the one network

596
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,040
for a handful of specific keywords.

597
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,600
So you should have better quality clicks now,

598
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,000
which is what you want, right?

599
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,320
We just set one up the other day

600
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,800
that we're gonna go back and do some filming on.

601
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:04,800
And I mean, Francesca, what was our estimated daily spend

602
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:08,280
between the two is like $50 something per day

603
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,400
is what we set it up for.

604
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,720
I know the total for like the month.

605
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,800
Well, I think the daily budget we set up

606
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,840
to be like $45 a day.

607
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,160
Yeah, there's two different ads and we were doing it,

608
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:22,400
but like our actual spend has been like,

609
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:26,560
what, maybe the most like $15 in a day.

610
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:31,280
So way under and they're getting way less impressions

611
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,560
because they're getting more quality impressions.

612
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:36,680
So the clicks they're getting are a lot more quality.

613
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,640
And that's a great thing

614
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,800
because you're not wasting the ad spend

615
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,560
and you're getting people that are actually looking

616
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,040
for your business.

617
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:43,880
So.

618
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,280
And yeah, and like we talked,

619
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:49,000
this ads are something that you kinda wanna keep an eye on

620
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,680
especially the first week,

621
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:53,800
but it's better to like have it higher and don't get scared.

622
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,800
Like just check in and see how much you're actually spending,

623
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,640
but then you can go and trim it back.

624
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,480
Yes.

625
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,320
Yeah.

626
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,160
Okay.

627
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,160
So I think we covered what we wanted to cover again.

628
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,400
This is for a call only ad.

629
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,320
We'll do another one maybe next week

630
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,840
where we do a click to call ad,

631
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,000
which is the website traffic setting.

632
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,960
It's super similar to this.

633
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,760
It's just, we click another button instead of another.

634
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,480
It's not really a huge difference though,

635
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,800
but we'll set that up just to show you guys.

636
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,880
It's not a huge difference.

637
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:27,440
It just land differently on the platform.

638
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,280
Okay.

639
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,320
So the call only ad, just FYI,

640
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,720
like that only like,

641
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:36,560
you will probably not see a lot of like desktop impressions

642
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:39,520
and or like tablet impressions.

643
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,960
It really only works on devices

644
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,320
that people can click the call.

645
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,080
So like I'm on my Mac,

646
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,040
I could probably get one

647
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,440
because I can FaceTime call out of it if I click.

648
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,160
But what's cool about that is that

649
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,320
it's definitely going to show more on phones.

650
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,240
And that's where most people are calling from anyways, right?

651
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,240
So anyhow, just wanted to throw that out there

652
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,240
and that should help you guys get your phones ringing.

653
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,280
So Francesca, do you have anything

654
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,680
you think we needed to review or cover?

655
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,200
No, I think you did awesome.

656
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,160
The only thing that was kind of weird for me at first,

657
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:16,440
so I kind of want to throw it out there so people know.

658
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,760
And what we mean by having like a call ad

659
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,800
and then a website ad,

660
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:25,000
they're all going to be under the same account.

661
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,960
It just means like we set, we go more into depth,

662
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,440
a little bit more advanced than a smart campaign.

663
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:35,120
And we set up the call ad

664
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,200
and then a separate one under the same account

665
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,240
for the actual website.

666
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,200
Well, doing a smart campaign,

667
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,320
you're letting Google do that for you pretty much, right?

668
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,240
Jeff, is that?

669
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,640
Uh, yes, yeah.

670
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:53,000
He just kind of makes it into a big mixing bowl

671
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,280
and we're trying to have a little bit more power

672
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,800
and then make it more detailed.

673
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,880
I don't know how else to describe it, but hopefully.

674
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,800
Yeah.

675
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:06,000
Well, this gets us back to like the original setup

676
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,800
of like the intent of the original smart campaigns

677
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:13,800
before Google started changing the platform on people.

678
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,760
So this allows everyone to kind of take back

679
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,040
a little bit more control.

680
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,080
And obviously just if you guys start, you know,

681
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,360
try not to play around with the framework too much

682
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,320
if you've not used to it

683
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,800
because you can easily get yourself in trouble.

684
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,840
So we tried to just make this super streamlined,

685
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:33,040
like click here, do this, do that, don't do that, do this.

686
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,560
We're trying just to keep you guys lined up

687
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,640
and squared away on it.

688
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,880
So you don't get in too much trouble.

689
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:42,840
That's definitely a potential issue with this.

690
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,880
So hopefully this is helpful

691
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,200
and you guys can be able to use this

692
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,600
for your own campaigns now.

693
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:56,600
With that, if anybody has any questions on anything,

694
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,120
type them into the Facebook.

695
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,560
I'm not really seeing anything,

696
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,840
but I'm gonna hit refresh here

697
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,160
because that could just be my bad.

698
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,520
So stand by.

699
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:06,320
But if anybody has any questions on anything,

700
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,240
please type it into the chat

701
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,240
and we'll give you guys a second here.

702
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,520
I'm not seeing anything.

703
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,640
Are you, Francesca?

704
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,800
No.

705
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,640
Okay.

706
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,760
We'll give it a minute.

707
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,040
We'll pin this, right?

708
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:24,040
So people can watch and pause it while you get started

709
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:28,680
and then we'll do the website one soon.

710
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,720
Yeah.

711
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,720
Yeah, definitely.

712
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,000
Yeah, we'll get into that.

713
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,400
Okay, someone, oh yeah, should we put negative keywords?

714
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,720
You can, you don't have to right away.

715
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,640
There are some that you want to,

716
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:46,640
like you go like cost, how to,

717
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,600
depending on what you wanna do,

718
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,600
like cheapest ideas.

719
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,440
It's probably like the main ones off the top of my head

720
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,640
that you wanna load in there first.

721
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:06,880
And then what'll happen is like after a handful of days,

722
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,760
you'll start seeing, right?

723
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:11,760
Because there's three different types of keywords, right?

724
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,600
There's broad match, phrase match and exact match.

725
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,880
Broad match is trash, we want that out.

726
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,520
Exact match can be good,

727
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:22,520
but they have to type in exactly like what you put in there.

728
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:25,000
So phrase match is good because like,

729
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,280
let's say I'm doing like landscaping.

730
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,960
Well, if I put landscaping as a phrase match,

731
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,000
then it could be like anything landscaping

732
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,120
will show an ad in that region.

733
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,440
So there might be ones where like you see something

734
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:41,480
and you just take like that one word before or after

735
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,920
and you throw that into the negative keyword list.

736
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,760
But it's definitely a lot easier to manage

737
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,560
than it was with the smart campaign.

738
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,560
So in theory, that should keep a bunch of the legions

739
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,640
from clicking into our ads

740
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,240
since most of them are coming from desktop and those.

741
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,360
Like I think you're talking about like Angie's

742
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,320
and thumbtack and all them.

743
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,960
They will probably be able to still click them,

744
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:12,080
but it will probably reduce it.

745
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:15,480
But those guys are spending millions of dollars

746
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,920
to beat the spammers and all the protections and all that.

747
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,080
So hopefully it'll reduce it a little bit,

748
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:24,160
but it's just part of the game now, unfortunately.

749
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,720
All right, are there any other questions?

750
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,720
I know it's the delay, huh?

751
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,840
I don't see anything, but we'll see.

752
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,800
Yeah, all right, we'll just give them a minute.

753
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,760
Like I said, there's like, there's this weird delay.

754
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,360
It's taken me a while to get used to.

755
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,000
Okay, here we go.

756
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,360
So Alex says, we have an ad we set up

757
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,640
under the Google smart campaign.

758
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,520
We received 520 clicks,

759
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,200
47, almost 48,000 impressions.

760
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,920
Yeah, it's six months of the cost.

761
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,200
We received no calls and of course, we,

762
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:09,160
yeah, it's just starting to turn and move on.

763
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,560
I would try to redo it,

764
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,560
but if you're getting that many clicks

765
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:16,480
and really low CPC like that,

766
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,440
I would bet that you probably have the budget

767
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,800
set too low for the smart campaign.

768
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,200
But what you can do is just pass the ad

769
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:30,480
but what you can do is just kind of pause that.

770
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,600
You probably have a lot of the good stuff already loaded

771
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,600
like your keywords and your locations

772
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,200
and your headlines and descriptions.

773
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:43,640
And I would just create a new search campaign

774
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:47,520
and then just set up the call campaign with the leads

775
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,640
and just set that up.

776
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,280
And you'll probably notice a significant drop

777
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,640
in impressions.

778
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,120
You're gonna notice a significant drop in clicks.

779
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:59,400
However, you're going to get a higher CPC

780
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,600
but you're gonna get better click-throughs.

781
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,560
Got it, thanks, you're welcome.

782
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,400
Okay.

783
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:30,120
Sorry, I need some weird people emailing me right now.

784
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,720
Okay, Francesca, do you have anything else to add?

785
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,440
No, I don't.

786
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,840
I think this is a good start.

787
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,760
It'll get everyone to be able to set them up

788
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:58,360
at least this first part, like the call ad

789
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:02,400
and then we'll go more in depth into the website one

790
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,680
and the webpage one, sorry, and everything else.

791
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,640
Yeah, definitely.

792
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:10,400
Like I said, everybody, next week we'll go in here,

793
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,360
probably use the same one and we'll set up the one

794
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:15,000
for the click to call ads,

795
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,880
which is the website traffic thing.

796
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,840
It's literally pretty much the same process.

797
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:22,920
There's just a couple of small tweaks on it.

798
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:25,280
We just wanted to show you guys the fast, easy way

799
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,840
to get this going and get on it.

800
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,840
So I don't really see a lot of people on,

801
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,400
not seeing a lot of other questions come in.

802
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,320
So we're gonna end the call here.

803
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,360
And once this kind of uploads and processes,

804
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:41,240
we'll go ahead and make sure it gets pinned to the top

805
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,920
or put in the files or something like that.

806
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,320
And we'll do that.

807
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:49,320
So Francesca, thank you as always for your expertise

808
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,160
and helping out.

809
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,040
Thank you, Jeff.

810
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,280
Hopefully this helps.

811
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,120
I think it will.

812
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:56,160
I think a lot of people are gonna be pretty stoked on it.

813
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,760
Like if they implemented it tomorrow,

814
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,160
by the time the weekend's over,

815
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,080
they'll be out of policy review.

816
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:06,400
And by Monday, Tuesday, they should start seeing some calls.

817
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,080
And just like we've seen on the one we set up for you,

818
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,680
that was just a little over a week ago now,

819
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,800
like eight days or so.

820
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,240
Like did you notice yesterday,

821
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,800
like a lot more clicks and calls yesterday?

822
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,600
We got one lead today.

823
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,520
Yeah.

824
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,640
Okay, yeah.

825
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:20,480
So we're already seeing,

826
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,200
like we can watch the uptick already.

827
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,240
Like as it comes out of that policy review

828
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,840
and that learning strategy,

829
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:28,040
you can start seeing it kind of hit its groove,

830
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,560
which is really common to the same thing.

831
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:32,000
That was the same thing with the smart campaigns, right?

832
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,680
It has to go through a few days.

833
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,520
That's why we always say,

834
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,640
hey, let things go for a couple of weeks.

835
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,400
With this stuff,

836
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,280
there's gonna be a little more maintenance off the top,

837
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,920
but it's a simple thing.

838
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,360
And we'll go over that maybe next week as well.

839
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,120
So, cool.

840
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,440
All right, everybody.

841
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,320
Since we don't see anything,

842
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
you guys are welcome.

843
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:51,880
We'll pin this up

844
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:54,480
and then you guys have any questions, reach out to us.

845
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,440
All right, take care.

846
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,280
Thanks again.

847
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,100
Thank you.

848
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:57,940
All right, bye.
