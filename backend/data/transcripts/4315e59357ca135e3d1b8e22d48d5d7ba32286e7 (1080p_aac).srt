1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
sometimes this only doesn't always happen but sometimes you get people that are kind of more pushy

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:09,760
so when you say well i can't promise like you said you know i care that you shouldn't care that

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:15,280
you're getting 100 leads you should care that you're actually making money then they sometimes say

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:22,080
well what kind of guarantees do i get then like what if you know and then one way that sometimes

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:28,480
that i've worked around that that has worked is by saying well kind of like you said um it doesn't

6
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,640
matter like i'm not going to be able to promise you because i would be lying how many leads are

7
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,800
coming in but what i can promise you is that i'll make sure that every month you're not going in the

8
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,880
red meaning you're not going to spend money with us and you're not going to make anything

9
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,920
you know what i mean and if that happens that ever happens where you're not even breaking even

10
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,800
we'll definitely have a talk and we'll work something out and i think that's what you personally care

11
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,680
when you have a business so if you say that usually they're like oh okay i don't have to worry about

12
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:04,000
you know not making any money or losing money with you i think that usually makes them feel

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,880
more reassured doesn't make sense totally makes sense what and another thing that i like to say

14
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,240
to people is i like to say like look there's no guarantees like they're just no guarantees the

15
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,640
only thing i can guarantee you know that stupid saying like the only guarantee is death and taxes

16
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,400
or whatever that's kind of cheesy but that's true and i just let them know i'm like look there's no

17
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,760
guarantees i've done this for many many many years i've made you know people thousands and

18
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:32,080
thousands of dollars and i would love to guarantee you but the truth is there is no guarantees

19
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:40,080
because we don't know what google is going to do tomorrow however what i excuse me what i can

20
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:45,520
guarantee mr business owner what i can guarantee mrs business owner is i can guarantee that i'm

21
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:52,320
going to be doing the same exact work that i did on bob's website that got this many leads i'm

22
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,480
going to do the same work and the same strategy that i did on joe's website that got the same

23
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:01,680
this many leads that i showed you i can control the work that i do and then we kind of have to

24
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,000
let the chips fall and that's just the truth and like that's that's kind of how life is so i'm

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,520
going to do everything in my power i'll be able to guarantee you that i'm doing the work i'll be

26
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,200
able to show you the work that i'm doing i'll be able to show you the steps that i'm taking

27
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,560
and show you they're the same steps i'm taking on these other projects but at the end of the

28
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,400
day there's no guarantee they're just i don't own google it's just how it is they could change

29
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,800
something tomorrow now i i that's not what i think is going to happen but i just want you to

30
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:32,080
understand like that's just how it is there's no guarantees and just likewise you know i know bob

31
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,080
if i send you a hundred leads if i said to you how many are you going to close what can you answer

32
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:42,000
me that question and they're like well no okay exactly and if you don't close deals guess what

33
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,680
this isn't going to work either so you can't guarantee me you're going to close deals and

34
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,760
i can't guarantee you this is it is what it is we're going to do the best that we can we're

35
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,920
going to have open communication it's it's going to be a little bit slow in the beginning it's

36
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,040
going to be a little rocky it's going to be a little up and down some months are going to be

37
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,600
good some months are going to be bad but at the end of the day as soon as we get this website

38
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,840
ranked we can lower the ads we can have more consistent lead flow and we're all going to

39
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,680
make money but i need you to pick up the phone i need you to treat the customers well i'll do

40
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,600
my job you do your job but that's it like we just we need to the biggest key no matter what you say

41
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:23,200
there's no magic formula is stop over promising okay the whole time you're doing the sale the

42
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,640
whole time you're doing the onboarding all your communication you think that by over promising

43
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,080
by yes yes yes you know best case best case best case you think that's going to solidify the deal

44
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,440
i promise you it's the opposite be transparent be conservative be worst case scenario and these

45
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,800
people are going to trust you because no one's like that with them everyone wants to give them

46
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,800
the best case scenario and they're they just they smell bs
