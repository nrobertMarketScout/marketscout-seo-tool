Robert says, Nick, do you try to sign first the BO that is on top of the sponsored ad section?
Do you check there? I don't really care if they're at the top or not. As long as they're running ads,
they're going on my list. But yeah, I mean, checking their reviews is not a bad thing.
If I'm looking at the reviews, they're like, oh, this guy is rude. This guy had no customer service.
That's going to be my partner. And that means they're probably not going to close deals. So
that's going to be an issue. I want to check into all those things. So Robert,
check into those things. But yeah, anyone at the top is going on my list. That's part of our
training or part of our module and building your list. So yes. Okay.
