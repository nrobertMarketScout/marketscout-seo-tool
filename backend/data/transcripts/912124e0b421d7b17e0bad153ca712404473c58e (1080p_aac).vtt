Hey guys, another question that I get quite often is some of you are asking like how much should you

00:05.760 --> 00:11.280
invest or how much should you spend in Google Ads before you give up on a deal? So first thing is

00:11.280 --> 00:16.880
that's to me is that's the wrong mindset to have. You lose money when you quit, you lose money when

00:16.880 --> 00:23.360
you stop. Yes there is such thing as learning and making mistakes and all that but that's why we

00:23.360 --> 00:28.000
really emphasize hitting good due diligence, choosing the right city, choosing the right niche.

00:28.960 --> 00:33.440
When running Google Ads there's going to be some niches that are going to be a little bit more

00:34.080 --> 00:39.360
expensive than others. That's why we try to have a really good due diligence process and you get

00:39.360 --> 00:44.320
a pretty good idea of that when you set up and run your, when you're setting up your Google Ad

00:44.320 --> 00:49.920
campaign. With that being said, you know if I'm running like say like something like towing

00:49.920 --> 00:55.840
where I need to have a lot of volume to make money, I'm going to probably spend a little bit

00:55.840 --> 01:02.320
more money in the beginning to land a new business owner than something maybe more like landscape or

01:02.320 --> 01:07.040
landscape design where I'm probably going to get less leads than I would for towing and I'm not

01:07.040 --> 01:12.320
going to be spending as much on that. So that question is a little loaded where it just you

01:12.320 --> 01:16.560
got to know your niche, you got to look at the volume. So that's why we use the data of search

01:16.560 --> 01:23.360
volume, CPC and then we set our budget and that'll help understand like where we should be at like in

01:23.360 --> 01:28.640
a month and stuff like that and then that'll give you that expectation of where you should be at.

01:28.640 --> 01:29.920
Hopefully that answers that question.
