00:00.000 --> 00:01.880
Sam says, could you do automated check-ins?

00:01.880 --> 00:03.600
Absolutely.

00:03.600 --> 00:06.400
Absolutely could do automated check-ins.

00:06.400 --> 00:08.400
I do think the phone call goes a long way,

00:08.400 --> 00:09.720
like just checking in with them.

00:09.720 --> 00:11.880
I think if you want to do an automated check-in,

00:11.880 --> 00:13.960
maybe like half the time, and maybe half the time

00:13.960 --> 00:16.280
you do a call, maybe you have it set up.

00:16.280 --> 00:19.880
The second and the fourth week, it's an email.

00:19.880 --> 00:22.000
And it's like, hey, whatever, whatever.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.440
The second week is this email, it's already scripted out.

00:24.440 --> 00:27.720
This one's this email, and maybe every month it changes.

00:27.720 --> 00:28.840
Totally.

00:28.960 --> 00:31.720
I think the other two weeks though, you need to call them.

00:31.720 --> 00:34.920
I think at least specifically for this first

00:34.920 --> 00:37.960
three to six month contract, you need to call them

00:37.960 --> 00:39.440
and you need to let them know that you care,

00:39.440 --> 00:42.320
that you're paying attention, that you're focused on them.

00:42.320 --> 00:45.120
Now, after that first contract's done

00:45.120 --> 00:47.520
and you've signed the new one, that's when you can go,

00:47.520 --> 00:49.520
okay, what parts of this can we automate?

00:49.520 --> 00:52.880
That's where they're so much easier to work with.

00:52.880 --> 00:55.720
Like, dude, the only time I even talk to my clients,

00:55.720 --> 00:58.000
let me give you an example, my artificial grass client,

00:58.000 --> 01:02.400
I've had him since 2021, okay, like the first of 2021.

01:02.400 --> 01:04.680
So I guess we're coming up on two years.

01:04.680 --> 01:08.000
I don't talk to this guy, like we just keep doing business.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.920
Now, I talked to him today.

01:09.920 --> 01:11.080
Well, he didn't answer.

01:11.080 --> 01:13.520
I called him today, but it wasn't to talk about business,

01:13.520 --> 01:15.680
it was because I needed a quote on a townhome

01:15.680 --> 01:16.520
that I just bought.

01:16.520 --> 01:18.240
And I had his little patch of grass and it looks like shit.

01:18.240 --> 01:21.120
I'm like, hey, let me get my guy to give me a quote.

01:21.120 --> 01:23.000
So they just become so much easier.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.320
Once you gain that trust, Sam, or anyone else asking,

01:26.320 --> 01:28.040
once you gain that trust during that first

01:28.040 --> 01:31.040
three to six month period, things ease up,

01:31.040 --> 01:34.760
but take your time, be okay doing things.

01:34.760 --> 01:36.360
I heard this once, I loved it.

01:37.480 --> 01:40.080
Be okay doing things that are unscalable

01:40.080 --> 01:42.080
because sometimes the unscalable things

01:42.080 --> 01:43.360
are the things that allow you to scale.

01:43.360 --> 01:45.240
I know that sounds kind of weird.

01:45.240 --> 01:46.560
Let me say that one more time.

01:46.560 --> 01:50.600
Be okay doing the unscalable things

01:50.600 --> 01:52.560
because sometimes those unscalable things

01:52.560 --> 01:54.840
are the very things that allow you to scale.

01:54.840 --> 01:57.520
What I mean by that is it's not scalable

01:57.520 --> 01:59.800
to checking every one of your clients every Friday.

01:59.800 --> 02:01.640
I get it, okay?

02:01.640 --> 02:05.760
However, sometimes those things that aren't scalable,

02:05.760 --> 02:07.240
they show the business owner, hey,

02:07.240 --> 02:09.000
I know this isn't scalable.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.480
He can't possibly do this to everyone.

02:11.480 --> 02:13.640
And that's the reason why it's so effective.

02:13.640 --> 02:16.920
So I would tell you during those first three to six months,

02:16.920 --> 02:20.400
that first contract, be okay making a phone call.

02:20.400 --> 02:22.240
And in the back of your mind, okay,

02:22.240 --> 02:24.720
let's set up some automation so that once he or she

02:24.720 --> 02:26.840
signs that second contract, boom,

02:26.840 --> 02:28.680
it's just an automated system, okay?

02:28.680 --> 02:29.520
Great question.
