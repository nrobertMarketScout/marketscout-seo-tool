1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
And my question is about Google Ads.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:09,600
So how important is it in the process of this process?

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,520
Does it start with Google Ads?

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,700
Or is there any other way to do it?

5
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,200
Yeah, so it's up to you guys.

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,280
I personally prefer using Google Ads

7
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,440
because I like to pre-sell my sites.

8
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:25,600
I like to go and get that deal upfront.

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,040
However, there's the other way to do it,

10
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,480
which is the traditional way.

11
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,640
I'll call it the traditional way, which is where you go,

12
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,000
you pick a city, you pick a niche, you rank the website,

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,040
then you go and sell it.

14
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,920
So if you're somebody, let's say you

15
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,120
don't have a lot of capital and you're

16
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,400
nervous to spend money on ads, I still

17
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,400
would argue it's better to go get the deal upfront.

18
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,320
But maybe you're not confident in your ability

19
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,400
to sell it, whatever, and that's what you want to do.

20
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,160
That is fine.

21
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,200
If you want, you could start at the second half

22
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,080
of the training, build a website, rank it,

23
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,800
and then go and start using the first half of the training

24
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,720
to sell the deal.

25
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,200
So you can do it either way.

26
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,040
I just prefer going into it and getting paid

27
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,160
while the website's ranking.

28
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,000
OK, so when you're running Google Ads,

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,080
do you do test out three, four sites or properties,

30
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,600
or you just run with one and then see if it is validated,

31
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,160
or you just stop it, or you continue to sell it off?

32
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,960
So how do you start with three, four properties

33
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,000
at the same time?

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,600
When you first start, I would recommend starting with one.

35
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,000
But once you get going and you've gotten that first deal,

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,360
you can start adding two.

37
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,440
And then once you figure that out,

38
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,520
you can start adding three.

39
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,360
And then what I do is once one website, one ad

40
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,360
starts to really work.

41
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,640
I start to get leads.

42
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,840
Then I pause the other two and I focus on the one and so forth.

43
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,000
So when you first start, you probably

44
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,040
want to start with one.

45
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,440
Got it?

46
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,520
Awesome, Moin.

47
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,400
Let's go get a deal, brother.

48
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,280
One thing I want to remind you of,

49
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,640
make sure that you're focusing on asking people for money.

50
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,240
Because no matter what you do, no matter how much content you

51
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,360
do, no matter how many backlinks you do,

52
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,400
no matter how many websites you look at,

53
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,480
unless you're asking people for money,

54
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,200
you're not going to make money.

55
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:26,720
Make sense?

56
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,520
Yeah.

57
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,880
Yeah.

58
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,760
Awesome, Moin, thanks for helping out, brother.

59
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,760
We'll talk soon.

60
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,400
And let's go get a deal, dude.
