1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
Okay, guys, let's do this.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:04,720
Let's get into some Q&A.

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,360
Moin, I got you in the waiting room.

4
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:07,360
You're first up.

5
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,740
What I'm going to do before I do that, I'm going to see if there's any quick questions

6
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:14,080
I can answer on the post since those came in first.

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,200
By the way, okay, let me just start with newest or I'm going to say all comments.

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,200
Let's see what we got here.

9
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,280
And I appreciate you guys posting the word king on the post.

10
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:28,880
It keeps that post kind of trending towards the top and then more people can see it, okay?

11
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,320
Let's see if we got any quick answers real quick.

12
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:37,480
Shiju, your question is super long, which I can check out here just a second, but I'm

13
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,680
going to see if I can knock out any quick ones.

14
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,480
I don't see the link, Daniel.

15
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,820
Hopefully he found it.

16
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:45,820
We are live.

17
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,680
Did you see it?

18
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,120
Okay, that's the only question I see on there.

19
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,840
So that said, I'm going to bring Moin on.

20
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:59,320
And also, guys, if you want, you're free to put questions in the chat as well, okay?

21
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,320
Here comes Moin.

22
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:16,800
Okay, Moin, can you hear me, bro?

23
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,800
There we go.

24
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,800
Yeah.

25
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,800
What's up, dude?

26
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,800
Yeah, can you hear me?

27
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,000
Yeah, can you hear me?

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I sure can.

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,920
And by the way, Luke, I think that's Luke Prichard.

30
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,920
You're next.

31
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,920
Hang in there waiting for me.

32
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:35,920
But Moin, what's your question, brother?

33
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:46,400
Moin, I can hear you clicking around like you're stealing someone's identity over there,

34
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,400
bro.

35
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,400
I know you're on.

36
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,400
Can you hear me?

37
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,400
Yeah, yeah, I can hear you.

38
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
What's your question, dude?

39
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Let's go.

40
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,400
Yeah, so, like, you know, like, my question is, like, about Google Ads.

41
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:04,520
So, like, how, you know, like, important is it in the process of, you know, of this process?

42
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:09,320
Like, does it start with Google Ads, or is there any other way to do it?

43
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,960
Yeah, so it's up to you, guys.

44
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:17,200
I personally prefer using Google Ads because I like to pre-sell my sites.

45
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,480
I like to go and get that deal up front.

46
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:28,200
However, like, there's the other way to do it, which is the traditional way.

47
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,720
I call it the traditional way, which is where you go, you pick a city, you pick a niche,

48
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,880
you rank the website, then you go and sell it.

49
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:42,320
So if you're somebody, let's say you don't have a lot of capital and you're nervous to

50
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:47,120
spend money on ads, you know, I still would argue it's better to go get the deal up front,

51
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,440
but maybe you're not confident in your ability to sell it, whatever, and that's what you

52
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,440
want to do.

53
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,440
That is fine.

54
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,520
If you want, you could start at the second half of the training, build a website, rank

55
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:00,640
it, and then go and start using the first half of the training to sell the deal.

56
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,840
So you can do it either way.

57
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:09,520
I just prefer going into it and getting paid while the website's ranking.

58
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,960
Okay, so when you're running Google ads, like, you know, like, do you do test out like three,

59
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:21,800
four sites or sites or properties, or you just run with one and then, you know, see

60
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:27,960
if it is validated or you just stop it or you continue, you know, sell it off.

61
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:32,840
So how do you start with three, four properties at the same time?

62
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:40,440
When you first start, I would recommend starting with one, but once you get going and you've

63
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:44,200
gotten that first deal, you can start adding two, and then once you figure that out, you

64
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,200
can start adding three.

65
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,400
And then what I do is once one website, one ad starts to really work, I start to get leads,

66
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,480
then I pause the other two and I focus on the one and so forth.

67
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,840
So when you first start, you probably want to start with one.

68
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,840
Got it?

69
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,840
Okay.

70
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,560
Let's go get a deal, brother.

71
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:09,640
You also, one thing I want to remind you of, make sure that you're focusing on asking people

72
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,680
for money, because no matter what you do, no matter how much content you do, no matter

73
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,040
how many backlinks you do, no matter how many websites you look at, unless you're asking

74
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,480
people for money, you're not going to make money.

75
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,480
Make sense?

76
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,480
Yeah.

77
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,480
Yeah.

78
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,480
So, awesome.

79
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,600
Well, Moin, thanks for helping out, brother.

80
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,800
We'll talk soon and let's go get a deal, dude.

81
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,240
All right.

82
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,240
Moin is out.

83
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,560
Let's get Luke in here.

84
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,560
Good question.

85
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,560
Let's see what Luke's got.

86
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,560
Okay, Luke, I cannot hear you.

87
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,560
It says it's connecting to audio.

88
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,560
Oh, I think it's connected.

89
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,560
There we go.

90
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,560
What's up, bro?

91
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,560
What's going on, Nick?

92
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,560
How you doing, man?

93
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,280
Hey, I'm about to get a hurricane up in here.

94
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,200
So just enjoying the sunshine.

95
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,000
I love that, dude.

96
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,520
Don't waste, you know, never, what do they say?

97
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,400
Never waste a good tragedy or a good opportunity like that.

98
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,400
Exactly.

99
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:20,760
Dude, one of my best years, 2018, I was in this niche called, I don't recommend this

100
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:25,600
niche by the way, but at the time I was in basement waterproofing and, dude, it was the

101
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,280
best time ever because all the basements flooded.

102
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Yeah, I know, man.

103
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,120
I got a GMB for foundation repair.

104
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,680
I think it's going to get really active.

105
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,680
Oh, yeah.

106
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,680
A hundred percent, man.

107
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,760
So where are you at right now?

108
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,760
I'm in Jacksonville.

109
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,760
Beautiful.

110
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,760
Shout out to these hurricanes, bro.

111
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,760
Yeah, I know, man.

112
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,760
It's going to get crazy.

113
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,760
So, yeah, dude, what's your question, man?

114
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:51,760
So, no, honestly, the course is amazing, Digital Landlords.

115
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,000
I wish I'd been putting more time into it.

116
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,920
I'm so busy with SEO clients and they take up so much of my time.

117
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,560
I keep putting out fires every single day.

118
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,400
I just want to give a big shout out to you, but also want to ask you, would you recommend

119
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:13,040
kind of burning the boats and ditching some of these clients in order to free up more

120
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:17,160
time or do you have any recommendations for outsourcing?

121
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:24,520
So I definitely, like when I started scaling, first of all, is this, it's kind of a contextual

122
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:29,160
question because if you need it to pay the bills and it's keeping you out of your job,

123
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,960
then that's one thing.

124
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,680
But I also know that it could be the thing that's causing you not to scale because your

125
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,260
attention is definitely going to be split.

126
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:43,060
What I did, again, this is just from experience, is in 2020 when I started scaling is I found

127
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,320
a strategic partner.

128
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,460
I created the strategic partner.

129
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:49,200
It was my employee that was doing my SEO.

130
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,760
He started a company.

131
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,440
We did a 50-50 split.

132
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,440
He would sign the deal.

133
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,440
I'd sign the deals.

134
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,440
I'd send them to him.

135
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,440
I wouldn't talk to the client again.

136
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,200
He would pay me 50% of the net profit.

137
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:04,360
That allowed me to keep some of the money, but also just to focus strictly on lead generation.

138
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,520
So that's what I did.

139
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,880
It worked out really, really well.

140
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:13,160
I still was able to make about, and every time I use, I say I made 100K a month.

141
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,160
I hope you guys know that was just with lead gen.

142
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:19,160
This was, when I talked SEO, that was just like gravy.

143
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:25,160
We were doing like 7,000 to 12,000 a month, my split of SEO, which means I could have

144
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:30,240
taken 20 if I would have done it myself, but I just decided, I could have taken 15 to 20,

145
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,720
but I decided I'm going to take half of that focus on lead gen because that's where I could

146
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,720
actually scale.

147
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,080
So that's what I would recommend as far as outsourcing.

148
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:42,880
I don't really have anyone that I've used that I would recommend.

149
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,400
I can ask around and get that for you.

150
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:51,360
It's just difficult when you're doing white labeling because people do the bare minimum.

151
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,440
They just want to get paid and they don't really care, but you can shoot me a message

152
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:01,960
and maybe there's some kind of a way you could even use my team.

153
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,240
I don't know, but yes, if you want to send me a message, I'm happy to do that, man.

154
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,240
All right, man.

155
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,240
You have a good one.

156
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,240
Bro, appreciate you hopping on.

157
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,560
Hey, good luck with the hurricane.

158
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,520
If you could, get us some good photos for the websites, dude.

159
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,720
Let's get some storm damage.

160
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,720
Yeah, maybe.

161
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,720
That's a good one.

162
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,720
All right.

163
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,720
I'll try my best.

164
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,720
Hey, good to talk to you, man.

165
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,720
We'll talk soon.

166
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,720
Later, Nick.

167
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,720
See you, my boy.

168
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,760
Okay, guys, good questions so far.

169
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:31,640
Let's see if I got anything else cooking in the chat.

170
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:35,560
Okay, let's see.

171
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,560
What else?

172
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,560
I'm going to go to Robert really quick.

173
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,640
Robert said he's got clicks, but no phone calls.

174
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,640
Can you assist?

175
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:49,000
One thing I would love to just try and just reiterate that something that I've tried to

176
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,040
really focus on is try to just, whenever you have an issue in your business, try to just

177
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:59,560
use your intuition and think, okay, and by the way, this goes for anything.

178
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:03,400
If your business owners aren't closing, but you're getting a bunch of people to a closing

179
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,280
call, then you could use the same exact logic, okay?

180
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:10,600
But with this situation, you're like, okay, I'm getting clicks, but no phone calls.

181
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:16,200
That means that people are clicking on my ads and I'm getting no phone calls.

182
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,960
Well, then you start kind of digging deeper, you go, all right, well, assuming that these

183
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:24,680
people are visiting my website, then that would mean that I'm either getting the wrong

184
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:34,720
people to my website because they're not ready to buy, they're not ready to call for an estimate,

185
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,120
so that could be number one.

186
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:41,960
The other thing is I have the right people, but my landing page isn't converting, right?

187
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:46,040
So that's what you have to look at and you have to kind of be logical about it, okay?

188
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:50,920
So what I would recommend is there's a couple of different things that you can do.

189
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:58,760
If you have an idea that maybe your website's not converting, you can go, there's a software

190
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:02,640
called Hotjar, you can install Hotjar on your, and there's other ones too, but you can install

191
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:07,080
Hotjar on your website, you can track and look at what people, you know, when they come

192
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,800
to the page, what are they doing, are they scrolling below the fold, are they doing this,

193
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,800
are they doing that, whatever.

194
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,200
So that's an idea.

195
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:18,400
If you think it's a conversion issue, if you think it's maybe the wrong type of customer

196
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,960
or you think they're clicking on the ad and they're not going to the website, for example,

197
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,720
I know sometimes I used to think it was my competitors, maybe you could go and you could

198
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,720
track, you could set up your analytics, you could see, are you getting, you know, how

199
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,320
much traffic are you actually getting?

200
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,160
Is it increasing?

201
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,520
Is it lining up with how many clicks you're getting?

202
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,160
And you just kind of have to dissect it from there and you just have to do a process of

203
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:38,760
elimination.

204
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:44,120
But if you guys are using the core keywords, you guys are following the training, most

205
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,720
likely you have the right traffic going to your website, which means that you have a

206
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:54,720
conversion issue, which then I would go, hey, is your website, you know, something that's

207
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,400
actually converting, is it user friendly?

208
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,400
Is it something that is scaring people off?

209
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,160
Is the number easy to find?

210
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,600
Is the quote form easy to find?

211
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,680
Or are you burying the stuff at the bottom, making it difficult?

212
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,680
So you just kind of have to use your intuition there.

213
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,440
Go look at some of our example websites.

214
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,520
You could go look at BentonvilleConcrete.com.

215
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,040
It doesn't have to be complicated.

216
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,080
It's very simple.

217
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,480
I promise you guys, even the ugly websites convert.

218
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,760
So that's kind of how I would attack that.

219
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,600
But that's a really good question, Robert.

220
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,440
OK, Luke, you might have had another question.

221
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,360
He's back in the waiting room.

222
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,280
Oh, shoot, hold on.

223
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,840
I think I might have just jumped him in there again.

224
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,600
Hey, did you?

225
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,400
Oh, he's out.

226
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,600
OK, I thought he had another question.

227
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,520
I was like, OK, boy.

228
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,280
Anyway, all right, let's keep going along.

229
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,320
Guys, any questions you have, drop them in the chat.

230
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,720
If you would like, you can you can grab the link.

231
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:49,320
I'm going to actually pin that comment so you can join with that link above.

232
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,400
You guys are just hopping on and you want to click on the Zoom.

233
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,360
Guys, I'm not that scary.

234
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,200
I promise you, I'm a complete goof.

235
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,760
If you guys, I know when I've I used to get on these live calls and I

236
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,440
was like, oh, my gosh, I can't imagine getting on live with the person.

237
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,760
It's not that big of a deal.

238
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,960
Just hop on live.

239
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,280
And, you know, let's ask your question.

240
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,400
It's going to be quicker.

241
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
All right.

242
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,120
Linnell says Google Keyword Planner says,

243
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,320
before I say this, I want to let you guys know something that's kind of exciting

244
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,800
because this is an ads question.

245
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:26,400
We actually this is this is why I love that I'm in the trenches, that I'm in the game,

246
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:31,080
that I think that you cannot trust anyone that's not, is because things change

247
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,880
so freaking much with this business, with any business.

248
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,920
I don't know how you could be in the business five years ago, 10 years ago,

249
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,680
eight years ago, like when I started or maybe four years ago

250
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,760
when I made my first million and pretend like I know everything.

251
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,440
Right. If I wasn't in the game, then I wouldn't have any idea

252
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,560
what you guys are talking about.

253
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,960
So what I want to let you guys know is we are in the process of once again,

254
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,280
testing out some new ad strategies, testing out some new

255
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,640
campaign strategies, spending my own money, testing it on my websites.

256
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,760
We've been doing this now.

257
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:04,560
It's been about five weeks, I believe.

258
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,760
And we're going to run it for another three weeks, making it eight weeks total.

259
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,040
And then we are going to be redoing the training for the ad section.

260
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,920
And I hate to even tell you guys this, because then everyone's

261
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,800
going to start asking when's it going to be done, when's it going to be done.

262
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:22,080
It's not going to be done probably till Q1 of 2025,

263
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:25,320
but we are actually going to be redoing the entire training

264
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:29,480
start to finish, which would make it the third version of this training

265
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,320
since we launched. OK, I'm actually really excited about it.

266
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,920
I'm a little bit nervous and intimidated by how big of a project that is.

267
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,040
But I also want to always be giving you guys relevant information.

268
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,440
And so any of those little tiny changes, it's kind of like when you have the books

269
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,400
and it's like the classic Think and Grow Rich and it says,

270
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,640
this is the 24th edition, right?

271
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,280
Just those minor things that change with the times.

272
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,280
So a lot of these things, I'm telling you this because once we launch

273
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,880
and what I'm going to do is before we actually launch,

274
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,840
I'm not going to wait to give you guys the the ads updates.

275
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,120
And we're going to introduce the ads updates as soon as possible.

276
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:09,800
And then for like two or three weeks, we're going to be doing Q&A on these calls.

277
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,240
So any of these questions, we're going to give you guys, you know,

278
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,880
the the the exact answers, maybe even show you guys live on screen.

279
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,400
So I just want to let you know that.

280
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,680
But let me look at this question says Google Keyword Planner says high end CPC.

281
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,960
By the way, Linnell, I don't know if you knew this already.

282
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,360
Have you checked out Ryan Dalton's

283
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:33,080
rank and rent engine? OK, because that is going to be our go to tool.

284
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,560
I should have mentioned this at the beginning.

285
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,920
But that's going to be our go to tool for search volume.

286
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,720
That's going to be our go to tool for due diligence.

287
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,520
That's going to be our go to tool for everything.

288
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:47,680
If you guys did not see that already, I think I can message Ryan right now.

289
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:52,640
Let me look. But there we were doing a

290
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,200
I'm going to drop the link really quick.

291
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,720
We were doing a link. I'm sorry, not a link.

292
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:04,600
We were doing a beta discount for anyone that wanted to check that out.

293
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,160
So I'm actually going to put this on your comments.

294
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,320
And I'm only mentioning this because that's going to be our go to on

295
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,160
the search volume and the due diligence and everything else.

296
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,240
OK, so check that out.

297
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,080
I can't even remember what the code was.

298
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,080
You have to look at the last one.

299
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,800
There's a code that you guys can use that will

300
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,800
maybe I should message Ryan really quick.

301
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,600
Hold on. Let me message him while we're waiting.

302
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,880
We just ask him, Ryan Dalton,

303
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:36,040
what's the discount code for beta users?

304
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,680
OK, anyway, guys, check that out.

305
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,520
The thing is sick. I'm pumped about it.

306
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,720
I'm actually going to be spending about 90 minutes today just playing around with it.

307
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,040
But anyway, it says high end CPC is five dollars with the clicks

308
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,440
I'm getting are saying twelve dollars.

309
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,800
It's in tree service.

310
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,840
Is it because the time of year less?

311
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,160
Lonell, can you do a favor for me?

312
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,360
Just make a quick loom.

313
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,080
Send me what you're getting or send it to me and send it to fix it.

314
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,320
Paid ads as well.

315
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,760
And we'll check that out because that's a bit more of a deep question.

316
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,920
And we'll dissect figure out what the heck's going on. OK.

317
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,280
Simon says, oh, what's going on, dude?

318
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,880
Luke says, we're in the meeting again.

319
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,720
Why are you reading this people just join the program?

320
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,080
Luke, Luke, Luke. OK.

321
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,120
OK, Simon has an interesting question.

322
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:28,720
He says, what do you think about Ecom with the digital asset approach?

323
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,400
Can he do it?

324
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:37,280
Guys, my answer to this is whether you're asking me about, you know,

325
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:41,680
whole barns, whether you're asking me about assisted living leads,

326
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,680
if you ask me about whatever, if you use this strategy,

327
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,040
which is getting paid traffic or organic traffic to a landing page

328
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,920
or to a website, you are going to get leads or conversions.

329
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,760
Because if you sell a product, the same principles apply.

330
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:00,640
However, the thing that makes this model so special

331
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,640
is the fact that we can use a generic website.

332
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:08,240
And we if if let's say our client starts to get sideways on us,

333
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,440
they start to get a little funny, they start to complain.

334
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,680
We can sell those leads to somebody else.

335
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,520
So if you do Ecom, let's say you go to a company and they're like,

336
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,040
hey, I want you to sell these water filters for us. Right.

337
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,760
And you're doing all this SEO for these water filters.

338
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,120
That's great.

339
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,960
But first of all, first of foremost, you're probably going to be doing SEO

340
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,760
on like a national level, which makes it very difficult.

341
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,240
It's going to be much more difficult to get SEO

342
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,040
to rank using SEO to get organic rankings.

343
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:39,160
The other thing, guys, is that company is kind of going to have you buy the balls.

344
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,160
Right. Because if you're advertising their products

345
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,120
and you're using their branding or their location or their specific

346
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:48,320
keywords that they want to target, what happens if they don't want to buy leads anymore?

347
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,840
So you have to remember that one of the best parts about this business model

348
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:56,320
is the ability to have complete control over our assets

349
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,120
and not have to be at the mercy of anybody.

350
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,960
And this kind of defeats the purpose of it.

351
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,840
So could it work? Yes. Do I recommend it? No.

352
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,840
If it's your own brand and it's your own ecom products,

353
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:12,280
your own ecom store, your own products, then OK, fine.

354
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:16,560
Use the SEO principles in the second half of the training to get your website ranked.

355
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,960
But to do it for somebody else, I don't think it's the move. OK.

356
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:26,440
There goes Luke Hill with the discount code ignition 24. Great.

357
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,920
Thank you. I'm going to try and.

358
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,840
Oh, he already did it. Thank you.

359
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:35,000
Beautiful. OK. Robert says hot jar.

360
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,120
Wow. Thank you. Yes. Hot jar. Great tool.

361
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,320
OK. I got somebody the waiting room.

362
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,880
I'm going to jump to them really quick.

363
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,280
And then I've got one or two more questions.

364
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,160
By the way, Simon said it's his own website.

365
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,400
Yeah, Simon, use the SEO.

366
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,400
Use the SEO strategies in the training for sure.

367
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,040
If it's your own website, absolutely. OK, 100 percent.

368
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,400
But just realize that that changes the model a bit.

369
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,400
Now you're just doing SEO for your own website, right?

370
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,240
OK, let's see what we got here.

371
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:06,600
SD. I have no idea.

372
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:10,080
I'm guessing who's SD, who's got the initial SD. SD.

373
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,880
I can see that you're connected to audio.

374
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,640
I just can't hear you. I can't see you.

375
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,320
Let me know if you can hear me. You can see me.

376
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,800
OK, not hearing anything.

377
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,760
Don't know what's going on.

378
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,880
Let's see what we got. OK.

379
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,720
Well, that person is figuring out what's going on.

380
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,520
I'm going to keep going.

381
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:41,920
OK, Rob Lamb says, what social media accounts do you create

382
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,040
like Facebook business page, Instagram page, Yelp

383
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:47,320
to increase your chance of getting a GMB as part of creating a new city niche account?

384
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:50,640
In other words, what are things you do to help improve Google acceptance?

385
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:57,240
Guys, I don't spend a bunch of time with GMB anymore, OK,

386
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:01,720
because to me, can you?

387
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,480
Yes. Is it still possible? Yes.

388
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,640
Did we actually recently got a GMB like in the last two weeks

389
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,200
trying some new strategies, but I have not found anything that's tried and true

390
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,960
that I'm confident saying, hey, here's the new strategy.

391
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:17,520
What I've kind of opted to do instead is that I am going to focus

392
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,320
on getting better at ads and getting better at organic rankings faster.

393
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,120
OK, because guys, think about it like this.

394
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:27,120
I've said this before, but you got to realize that when we have

395
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,800
with Google, right, you can get leads from paid ads,

396
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,520
you can get leads from the Google My Business or the local

397
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,440
and you can get leads from organic.

398
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,600
And if you can get two of those three, you're going to be just fine.

399
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:44,280
Back in 2020, when I was just trying to figure things out

400
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,800
on more than half of my website or at least half of my websites,

401
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,400
I didn't even have a GMB because it didn't click to me.

402
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,080
It didn't occur to me that I could use the business owner's address.

403
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,640
I didn't understand all the stuff.

404
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,560
And so I was going along getting deals scaling up to one hundred

405
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,400
thousand dollars a month, not realizing that I even needed a GMB.

406
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,080
You don't need a GMB.

407
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,200
Now, if you can get one, does it help? Sure.

408
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,800
But even if I have them, I don't like to rely on them for leads

409
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,960
because I feel like they're always problems.

410
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,600
You're falling off. You're doing this.

411
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,880
You're getting suspended. You're checking, checking, checking.

412
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,840
So for me, I just decided, you know what?

413
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,400
I'm going to focus on getting better at the things that I know how to do,

414
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,960
which is ads and organic.

415
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,400
And if we can get the GMB grade, if we can't, then whatever.

416
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:28,240
However, I will tell you that, yes, the Facebook business page does help.

417
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,000
The Yelp page does help.

418
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,280
But me personally, I'm just focusing on I told you that I'm in simplification mode.

419
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,400
I mean, hey, these are the things I know that work.

420
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,400
So I'm going to focus on them.

421
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,000
And so that's what I've tried to put my effort on.

422
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,680
That doesn't mean you can't.

423
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:46,040
Doesn't mean that's not a possibility, but that's where I'm putting my focus. OK.

424
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,960
What else we got here?

425
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,840
So hopefully, oh, there we go. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

426
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,240
OK, can you hear me, SD?

427
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,360
Yeah, I can hear you. It's actually should do Daniel.

428
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,800
Oh, what's up, bro? How are you?

429
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,200
Hey, good. This will be good.

430
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,280
Find your question, because I saw your question on the other one.

431
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:08,960
And I know to be very honest, I saw it and I was like, it's kind of long.

432
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,640
I'll come back to it.

433
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,720
And I'm glad you hopped on it because I forgot to go back to it.

434
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,160
So ask me your question.

435
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,480
All right. So I'm having a tough time figuring out if I'm picking the right guy.

436
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,840
So I just went back to the keywords that you created.

437
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,520
OK, so I'm doing like a ton of analysis.

438
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,560
Maybe I'm doing too much.

439
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:26,240
I'm analyzing like 26 here because I wrote it.

440
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,560
I'm a programmer, so I wrote an app to do all this for me.

441
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,240
I'm not doing it manually.

442
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,320
So I'm running like 26 keywords per city.

443
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,160
And that's the screenshots I put in.

444
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,480
So am I doing too much?

445
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:40,720
Like, how do I know if those cities I pasted in are actually good?

446
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,800
Yeah, I think you're doing too much.

447
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:46,240
I mean, dude, look, I think you're doing too much.

448
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,040
Look, I think people like you are I swear to you.

449
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,200
And I mean this and I mean this as a compliment.

450
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,440
You guys are too smart.

451
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,920
Like the reason why this model works really well for people like me is because I'm like,

452
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:02,000
all right, I don't even have the patience to do more than like five or seven.

453
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:06,200
I don't think you need more than five or seven keywords to analyze the city.

454
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:11,240
OK, all right. So the second part was, I mean, let me say one last thing.

455
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,480
So like tree service, I know that the lists are in here.

456
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,600
I can I can share those two.

457
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,680
And guys, if you guys have lists or you've seen lists I've shared in the past,

458
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,600
that would be awesome for you guys to reshare those.

459
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,520
I can also go and find them.

460
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,840
But tree service, you're looking at at least concrete, because it's just the one

461
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,200
that was used. So concrete is the core keyword.

462
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,960
They got concrete contractors.

463
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:34,320
I think concrete company, concrete patio, concrete driveway, concrete sidewalk.

464
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,800
There might be one more.

465
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,120
I'm going to use those keywords plus the city.

466
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:42,320
And that's going to be enough for me to say yes or no on a city.

467
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,640
That's part one. What's part two?

468
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,040
Part two was.

469
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:51,560
I can't remember right now, so it should I split out the ads like for

470
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:54,760
let's say I do three ads for concrete, like one is driveway, one is cement,

471
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:58,240
one is patio. Should I do it all in one or split it into three?

472
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,480
So repeat that question again.

473
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,680
So you're saying split the budget into three.

474
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,160
Yeah, or make three separate ads.

475
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:15,240
Separate ads like do only one ad that concentrates on cement keywords.

476
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:20,280
Do another ad that only concentrates on patio keywords.

477
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,720
You know what? That's a really good question.

478
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:27,880
I don't want to give you guys I would not want to give you advice that.

479
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:31,600
And I said this at the beginning of the call, I this would be a question

480
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,400
I would I would much rather fix it paid ads answer.

481
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:39,040
What I would want you to do on this question, and I don't know if you caught this,

482
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:42,400
but we're actually redoing again the training on the ads and then

483
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,640
and also the entire training.

484
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,520
But for this specific question, I think this is this be valuable for everybody.

485
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:52,440
If you would post that just that simple question, say, you know, whatever,

486
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,360
post that in the group.

487
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,880
And then if you want to go a step further, make a quick little loom

488
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:59,560
and send it to me and fix it paid ads, I'll give you an in-depth answer.

489
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,600
But I don't want to just shoot something off the hip.

490
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,280
So would you do that for me?

491
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,480
Yeah, I'll definitely do that.

492
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:11,080
The only reason I ask is because when you have targeted keywords for that ad,

493
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,680
you get to, you know, you get to that 100 percent.

494
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,760
You know how good the ad is.

495
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,040
You know, you get poor, good and excellent.

496
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:21,840
If it's all related, like you get closer to the excellent faster.

497
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:27,320
That's why my my knee jerk reaction is I would tell you to do a separate ad

498
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:32,720
for each, because, yes, that that is the relevancy that that's really going to help.

499
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,840
And we've noticed that's been a big thing

500
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,000
with the way that we're doing ads now.

501
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,720
However, I also don't want to, you know, if there's somebody out there

502
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,120
that's listening to this and they hear that, oh, three ads,

503
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,200
I would rather you just get them up than not get them up at all.

504
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,520
So if that's causing analysis, paralysis, no.

505
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,240
But yes, 100 percent what you're saying, I think that is going to be the answer.

506
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,280
But I would love for you to post that.

507
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,160
Let's get everyone's feedback.

508
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:57,120
I'll get fix it paid ads in there and then keep an eye out for this

509
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:02,520
updated training, which we're about five five out of eight weeks into the testing of.

510
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,440
All right. Sounds good.

511
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,000
I think I got all my questions out of the way.

512
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,440
Awesome, man. Well, I appreciate it.

513
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,760
And let's go get some deals, dude. Thanks a lot.

514
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,760
Hey, talk to you, man.

515
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,920
OK, guys, there's another question or two I want to answer.

516
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,240
You guys have really good questions.

517
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,280
I've got a question is what do you guys use for phone numbers?

518
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:23,400
I'm going to drop the rank and rent engine

519
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,160
link because that is where we are now buying all of our phone numbers.

520
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:33,080
However, another option is call rail.

521
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:36,200
But it's a little more expensive.

522
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,800
That's what we started by using. OK, so there you go.

523
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,280
Hopefully that answers your question.

524
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:48,000
Luke said, if you throw up a GMB as well for Ecom, it can be a moneymaker.

525
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,400
I've done it before, but that's for more.

526
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:54,120
Yeah. And that's a good point, Luke, is if this is for your own Ecom,

527
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,520
you're going to be able to get if it's a legit brand, a legit company,

528
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,280
you should be able to get your GMB much easier.

529
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:02,280
So that's a great little nugget you tossed in there.

530
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,280
OK, Simon says, do you have a list where one can see the key

531
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:11,280
services by country, if not, that would be really handy for all of us.

532
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,480
Post that in the group. Great question.

533
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:16,400
And I think what he's saying is like, what are the recommended

534
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,440
services in each country?

535
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:23,520
And I think that that would be the the the people that are most

536
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,040
equipped to answer those questions would be the people in those countries.

537
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,640
OK, so I'm not doing any deals in Australia.

538
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,360
I'm not doing any deals in the UK personally,

539
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,000
because I'm making my money here.

540
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,720
It makes no sense for me to do that other than probably just a test,

541
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,480
which I probably should.

542
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,160
But drop that question, guys.

543
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,560
We have a we have a community of 700 people trying to do this.

544
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:45,360
You guys don't have to be on an island by yourselves.

545
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,800
Amazing questions.

546
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,280
Drop that question if you would in the group.

547
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,800
And let's see if anybody has recommendations.

548
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,160
However, I do know just off top my head,

549
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:59,280
tree service seems to be something that is valuable in every single country.

550
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,200
I've seen that in every single question.

551
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,880
I'm going to I'm going to stand by that one.

552
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,760
That one seems to be like a pretty good one in every single country

553
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,880
from what I could tell. OK.

554
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,280
Steven says you can also decline the recommendations and it will push you up

555
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:16,560
to 100 percent. Amazing. Great feedback. OK.

556
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,520
Gina says, are you going to do more training on the RankinRat engine platform?

557
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,080
Yes, we are.

558
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,880
We didn't. We wanted to just introduce it really quick

559
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,600
and then let everybody play with it.

560
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,920
And we guys, by the way, if you guys are interested in

561
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,600
if you guys are using that product,

562
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,920
please give feedback to Ryan so we can improve it.

563
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,440
We've noticed a few tiny little bugs as we've been testing with our team.

564
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,080
But that's to be expected. It's beta test.

565
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,360
It's pretty damn good for being a beta test.

566
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,000
But please give feedback to Ryan.

567
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,720
Send him an email. Send him a direct message. Do both.

568
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,720
And yeah, let's just play around with that.

569
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,680
Let's make that thing the I mean, if you guys give us feedback, we can

570
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,120
we can go and I can tell Ryan, hey, let's change this.

571
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,000
Let's change this. I'm super excited about that.

572
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,040
But yes, we're going to be doing that the first week of November

573
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,400
when we do our official launch.

574
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,720
We'll be doing way more training.

575
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:10,880
But that was kind of just like a hey, let's let let's let people

576
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,920
in the community test this out first.

577
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,800
But there will be a significant amount more.

578
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,840
Plus, there is a Facebook group.

579
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,040
I don't know if you're part of that yet, Gina.

580
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:22,240
Maybe I'll put this in the answer, but I'm going to say join

581
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,120
the Facebook group.

582
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,880
The rank and rent engine Facebook group.

583
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,720
Yes. OK, so a lot, a lot more to come as far as that training.

584
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,680
That's going to be integrated in everything that we do.

585
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,880
Case. OK, Robert says we got one or two more questions here.

586
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,000
Robert says, Nick, do you try to sign first to be all

587
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,160
that is on top of the sponsored ad section?

588
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,280
Do you check there?

589
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:53,440
I don't I don't really care if they're at the top or not.

590
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,000
As long as they're running ads, they're going on my list.

591
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,280
But yeah, I mean, checking their reviews is not a bad thing.

592
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,280
If I'm looking at the reviews, they're like, oh, this guy is rude.

593
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,080
This guy had no customer service.

594
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,600
That's going to be my partner.

595
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,200
And that means they're probably not going to close deals.

596
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,040
That's going to be an issue. I want to check into all those things.

597
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,520
So Robert, check into those things.

598
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,760
But yeah, anyone at the top is going on my list.

599
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,320
That's part of our training or part of our module and

600
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,280
building your list.

601
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:22,600
So, yes. OK, Simon says he volunteers for Middle East and Armenia.

602
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,440
Amazing. Go ahead and make that post and then give us your recommended niches.

603
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,480
You recommend industries for Armenia.

604
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,680
OK, Gina says I'm loving it and have some feedback for sure.

605
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,840
Yes, that's great. Maybe we'll even do something midweek.

606
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:38,080
Gina, I will even have a pen here. Yeah, I do.

607
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,680
I'm going to make a note here.

608
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,160
Maybe we'll go live, me and Ryan, and we'll just do some more training

609
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:50,640
and answer questions and get feedback.

610
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,480
That's a great idea, actually. I just wrote it down.

611
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,040
OK, no problem on the questions.

612
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,640
OK, what else? I have time for one more. Let's see.

613
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:12,760
OK, Rankinret engine says I couldn't use some of my unique niches.

614
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:15,960
OK, I don't know exactly what you're saying, but that is great feedback.

615
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,600
Would you send that feedback to Ryan?

616
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,600
Just send him a direct message and tell him which niches you're talking about.

617
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:25,880
Maybe that's just a glitch and let's get that feedback.

618
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,960
That's really good feedback.

619
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:31,960
Hey, Simon says, how can we measure market saturation for digital assets?

620
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:37,200
That's I might need you to give a little bit more information on that.

621
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,800
Maybe you can and I can answer it on a on a comment.

622
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:44,480
But guys, I'm telling you, those of you guys that are worried about saturation,

623
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,200
we are there. Go watch my videos.

624
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,120
Type in saturation. Is Rankinret saturated on YouTube?

625
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,720
And go listen to my logical answers, OK?

626
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,720
This is not saturated.

627
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,920
And just because you guys are seeing other Rankinret people,

628
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,520
other marketers does not mean it's saturated.

629
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:03,280
Just because there's someone else the website doesn't mean you can't have one.

630
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:06,880
Just because there's somebody else that, you know, sorry,

631
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,640
just because there is somebody that has a website in your niche and city

632
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,160
does not mean they even have a client.

633
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,560
It doesn't even mean that they're even in the business anymore.

634
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:17,760
It doesn't mean that they know how to sell and create a deal.

635
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,720
You guys have to remember that those websites that you guys see

636
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,680
and get so scared of, they are just like another local business.

637
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,320
OK, don't worry about that. Keep going. OK.

638
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,440
OK, guys, got a ton of so many good questions.

639
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:33,120
I mean, here's what I'm going to do. I'm either going to roll it.

640
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,600
I'm going to try to either answer these on comments, me or Aaron

641
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,520
or fix it, fix it, Felix.

642
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:42,080
Or I'm going to create YouTube videos out of these questions

643
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,160
and I'll send you guys a link to these guys.

644
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,520
I really love you guys hopping on.

645
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,280
I hope next time we have even more people.

646
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:51,160
It's fun to connect with you guys, to to hear your voices,

647
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:54,480
see your faces, to remember that like we're all in this together.

648
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,360
We're all trying to make money.

649
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,360
We're all trying to create better lives for ourselves.

650
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,800
So, guys, let's go make some money.

651
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:02,200
Don't forget that you're not making money if you're not asking for money.

652
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,960
OK, no matter how many of these questions we talk about, you know,

653
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:10,120
we, you know, as this keywords that at the end of the day,

654
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,720
it's about how many offers we make.

655
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,960
That's how you make money.

656
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,280
