Okay. Does it matter which tool we use at all? Are some tools superior? No, I don't think so.
I don't think so. I use SEMrush because it's what I was trained on. That's why I use it.
I don't think you guys have to use SEMrush. Karina, SEMrush numbers are so much lower than
other tools. Why don't we use Keyword Planner for volume and CPC? Yeah, great question. So again,
it's based on what does the tool that you're thinking of show for St. George's Block Wall?
What does it show for the site that you're looking at doing? Go find a site that's producing at least
30 leads a month and look and see what the volume is on your tool and set that as a benchmark.
