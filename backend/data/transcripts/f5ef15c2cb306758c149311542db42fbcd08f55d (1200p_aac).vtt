Okay, so to close one deal a week, how many ads and sites would you say and business owners

00:05.720 --> 00:08.720
I need on the hook per week to close one?

00:08.720 --> 00:09.720
Depends on its close rate.

00:09.720 --> 00:12.720
Right now, you're going to need a lot more.

00:12.720 --> 00:14.400
Right now, I need like a bazillion more and it's still one.

00:14.400 --> 00:17.680
Well, right now, you don't know because you haven't closed one, but what I would say is

00:17.680 --> 00:21.820
if you haven't closed one, just go ahead and go off with like a 25% close rate, right?

00:21.820 --> 00:26.560
So you've gotten two because even if you close your next one, you're at a 33%, right?

00:26.560 --> 00:27.560
Yeah.

00:27.560 --> 00:28.560
If you close the one up that year, 25.

00:29.120 --> 00:32.880
So 25 would be a very conservative number because guys, it's not like you're just getting

00:32.880 --> 00:33.880
on this random people.

00:33.880 --> 00:37.440
You guys are getting on with warm people that are already paying for ads, they already know,

00:37.440 --> 00:38.440
they already like it.

00:38.440 --> 00:41.640
They tasted the nectar, they tried the Costco sample.

00:41.640 --> 00:43.440
These guys are ready to be closed.

00:43.440 --> 00:46.600
So 25% is like very conservative.

00:46.600 --> 00:51.000
So if you want to base it off of that, but also remember your close percentage right

00:51.000 --> 00:54.240
now is going to be vastly different from your close percentage by midsummer when you're

00:54.240 --> 00:55.240
getting damn good at this.
