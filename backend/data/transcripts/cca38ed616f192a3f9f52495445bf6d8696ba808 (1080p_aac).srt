00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,280
Robert said, he's got clicks, but no phone calls.

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,120
Can you assist?

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:08,120
So guys, one thing I would love to just try

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,780
and just reiterate that something that I've tried

5
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:14,320
to really focus on is try to just,

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,120
whenever you have an issue in your business,

7
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:19,400
try to just use your intuition and think, okay.

8
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,480
And by the way, this goes for anything.

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,520
If you're not, if your business owners aren't closing,

10
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,780
but you're getting a bunch of people to a closing call,

11
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:29,440
then you could use the same exact logic, okay?

12
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,280
But with this situation, you're like, okay,

13
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,360
I'm getting clicks, but no phone calls.

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,800
So that means that people are clicking on my ads

15
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,320
and I'm getting no phone calls.

16
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,120
So well, then you start kind of digging deeper.

17
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,160
You go, all right, well, assuming that these people

18
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,120
are visiting my website, then that would mean

19
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:50,160
that I'm either getting the wrong people to my website,

20
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,840
right, because they're just not, they're not ready to buy.

21
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:57,460
They're not ready to call for an estimate.

22
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:58,880
So that could be number one.

23
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,720
The other thing is I have the right people,

24
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,800
but my landing page isn't converting, right?

25
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,160
So that's what you have to look at

26
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,800
and you have to kind of be logical about it, okay?

27
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,520
So what I would recommend is there's a couple

28
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,320
of different things that you can do.

29
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,960
If you have an idea that maybe your website's

30
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,960
not converting, you can go,

31
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,600
there's a software called Hotjar.

32
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,040
You can install Hotjar on your,

33
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:24,960
and there's other ones too,

34
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,060
but you can install Hotjar on your website.

35
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,460
You can track and look at what people,

36
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:30,480
you know, when they come to the page,

37
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,320
what are they doing?

38
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,220
Are they scrolling below the fold?

39
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,060
Are they doing this?

40
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:33,900
Are they doing that?

41
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:34,720
Whatever.

42
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,560
So that's an idea.

43
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,100
If you think it's a conversion issue,

44
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:41,340
if you think it's maybe the wrong type of customer,

45
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,100
or you think they're clicking on the ad

46
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,860
and they're not going to the website, for example,

47
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:47,420
I know sometimes I used to think it was my competitors,

48
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:50,180
maybe you could go and you could set up your analytics.

49
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,500
You could see, are you getting, you know,

50
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,260
how much traffic are you actually getting?

51
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:55,100
Is it increasing?

52
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,820
Is it lining up with how many clicks you're getting?

53
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,660
And you just kind of have to dissect it from there

54
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,660
and you just have to do a process of elimination.

55
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:04,640
But if you guys are using the core keywords,

56
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,620
you guys are following the training,

57
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:09,660
most likely you have the right traffic going to your website,

58
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,860
which means that you have a conversion issue,

59
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:15,220
which then I would go, hey, is your website,

60
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:18,340
you know, something that's actually converting,

61
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,300
is it user friendly?

62
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,300
Is it something that is scaring people off?

63
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,060
Is the number easy to find?

64
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,540
Is the quote form easy to find?

65
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,820
Or are you burying the stuff at the bottom,

66
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:27,660
making it difficult?

67
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,580
So you just kind of have to use your intuition there.

68
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,300
Go look at some of our example websites.

69
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,620
You can go look at BentonvilleConcrete.com.

70
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,900
It doesn't have to be complicated.

71
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,140
It's very simple.

72
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,860
I promise you guys, even the ugly websites convert.

73
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:41,020
So that's kind of how I would attack that.

74
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,060
But that's a really good question, Robert.
