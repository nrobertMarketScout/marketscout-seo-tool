Irving, we have a site that ranks very well organically, about 80 gross leads a month,

00:03.760 --> 00:08.720
but about 75% of leads are spam calls, web forums, still 20 qualified leads. A business

00:08.720 --> 00:12.560
owner is not digging it, misses some calls, and when he does pick up, it's spam calls.

00:12.560 --> 00:17.360
Any suggestions for a situation like this? I told him to pick up every call, follow up every call,

00:17.360 --> 00:22.400
because the call he misses out might be a juicy one that he'll miss out on.

00:23.680 --> 00:28.640
I don't know what you're using. I know with some of these tools, you can blacklist some of these,

00:28.640 --> 00:32.720
but I'm going to be honest, I've had this happen a lot, and I think not a lot, but it had to happen

00:32.720 --> 00:38.880
a few times. I think when you're buying tracking numbers, you just got to realize that sometimes

00:38.880 --> 00:44.480
you get a shitty one, and sometimes it's a number that's been spammed out, and so there have been a

00:44.480 --> 00:47.520
couple instances where we've just had to change the phone number, and it sucks because you have

00:47.520 --> 00:52.480
to go and update it on your GMB and the whole thing, but what I would do first is try and do

00:52.480 --> 00:57.920
the blacklisting thing and see if you can figure that out, and then if you absolutely have to,

00:57.920 --> 01:02.240
I think it's worth it long term to just let the business owner say, hey, we're going to have a

01:02.240 --> 01:06.480
little bit of a decrease in calls, but we're getting a new phone number to get rid of this issue,

01:06.480 --> 01:11.920
and now every call that comes in should be a good one. Now you've got to go update your citations

01:11.920 --> 01:15.760
and all that good stuff, but nonetheless, I think that it's worth it at some point.
