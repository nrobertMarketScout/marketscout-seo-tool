Cody says, what about the ones that refuse to do Zoom

00:02.520 --> 00:05.440
or don't know how, what do you mean?

00:05.440 --> 00:08.040
Like, it's not, I don't give them an option, Cody.

00:08.040 --> 00:12.240
I just say, hey man, let's do a Zoom.

00:12.240 --> 00:13.320
We're gonna be doing a Zoom.

00:13.320 --> 00:15.000
And they're like, oh, I just wanna talk on the phone.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.760
That's not how it roll, that's not how I roll.

00:16.760 --> 00:18.640
I want you to see my face.

00:18.640 --> 00:20.000
I wanna like know who you are.

00:20.000 --> 00:23.080
If I'm gonna work with you, I wanna see who you are

00:23.080 --> 00:25.480
and I wanna talk to you on a Zoom call.

00:25.480 --> 00:26.920
It's really hard.

00:26.920 --> 00:28.280
You see, I'm gonna send you this link.

00:28.280 --> 00:30.280
It's gonna be a text and you're gonna push,

00:30.280 --> 00:32.000
it's gotta underline, you know what that is, right?

00:32.000 --> 00:34.960
Push that and you should be good to go, okay?

00:34.960 --> 00:37.360
Maybe you tell them to download Zoom, whatever.

00:37.360 --> 00:39.220
It's not an option, okay?

00:39.220 --> 00:40.520
Cody, answer your question.
