Okay, B says, Nick, what do you do when people call

00:04.140 --> 00:08.860
and ask if this is so-and-so company when you run ads?

00:08.860 --> 00:11.340
Do you do something to make the ads stop generating those?

00:11.340 --> 00:15.220
No, so what I usually do is I usually try my best

00:15.220 --> 00:16.700
to turn those into leads.

00:16.700 --> 00:21.700
So we'll say, no, did you already call us?

00:22.100 --> 00:24.100
Or we'll usually just say,

00:24.100 --> 00:25.700
were you looking for an estimate?

00:25.700 --> 00:27.740
Oh, yeah, but I was looking for so-and-so company

00:27.740 --> 00:29.180
or they already gave me an estimate.

00:29.200 --> 00:30.080
Oh, okay, cool.

00:30.080 --> 00:31.640
Well, we'd love to give you another estimate.

00:31.640 --> 00:33.880
Are you open to getting another free estimate?

00:33.880 --> 00:36.240
And we'll just try and turn it into another lead.
