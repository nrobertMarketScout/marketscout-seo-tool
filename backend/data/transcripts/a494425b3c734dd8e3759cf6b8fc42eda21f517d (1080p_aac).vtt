00:00.000 --> 00:13.400
So guys, you start building your list and you're like, well, there's not that many people

00:13.400 --> 00:15.160
paying for Google ads.

00:15.160 --> 00:18.800
There's a couple on Home Advisor, but should, like, what do I do and should I continue to

00:18.800 --> 00:21.700
pursue this if there's not that many people paying for Google ads?

00:21.700 --> 00:25.240
That is a really good question and I'm going to talk about that right now.

00:25.240 --> 00:29.120
So I want you to have, like, think about it this way.

00:29.120 --> 00:33.000
The first thing that you want to think about is, okay, you're in Utah, you're in Pennsylvania,

00:33.000 --> 00:37.400
you're in California, wherever you're sitting, and you're probably searching for, you know,

00:37.400 --> 00:39.320
these searches in a different state.

00:39.320 --> 00:41.280
Maybe not, but most likely you are.

00:41.280 --> 00:46.080
And so one of the reasons why you might not be seeing ads is because of where you're searching

00:46.080 --> 00:47.080
from.

00:47.080 --> 00:50.680
Now, that's not always the case, but that is sometimes the case.

00:50.680 --> 00:54.640
So I'm going to recommend a couple of tools that you can use where you can put in the

00:54.640 --> 00:59.040
search terms and you can put in the city and it's actually going to search it as if

00:59.040 --> 01:00.040
you were there.

01:00.040 --> 01:05.720
Okay, it's going to kind of, like, change your IP address, if you will, and it's going

01:05.720 --> 01:10.640
to give you different search results, different ads are going to show up because it's going

01:10.640 --> 01:12.640
to look like you're actually there.

01:12.640 --> 01:16.280
So a couple of those tools, if you look at my screen here, a couple of those tools that

01:16.280 --> 01:19.760
I'm going to recommend, I actually have never used this one, I kind of like it.

01:19.760 --> 01:23.800
I'm not sure, it looks like there's a paid, like, you could do a free trial.

01:23.800 --> 01:26.480
I got a couple of searches for free.

01:26.480 --> 01:29.760
It was seranking.com, actually really cool.

01:29.760 --> 01:30.760
Like that one a lot.

01:30.760 --> 01:31.760
You could check that out.

01:31.760 --> 01:35.600
You literally put in the keyword, you know, country's already there unless you are in

01:35.600 --> 01:39.960
Australia, Canada, I don't care where you're at, you put in the country and then you put

01:39.960 --> 01:40.960
in the location.

01:40.960 --> 01:41.960
So that was cool.

01:41.960 --> 01:43.740
I checked this box.

01:43.740 --> 01:48.880
Another popular fan fave is the valentine.app.

01:48.880 --> 01:51.560
That's one that's kind of an OG, if you want to check that one.

01:51.560 --> 01:57.680
So a couple of tools that you can check out to change what it looks like your location

01:57.680 --> 02:00.160
is to give you a different search result.

02:00.160 --> 02:01.760
The next thing that I do is this.

02:01.760 --> 02:02.960
That's number one.

02:02.960 --> 02:06.000
Next thing that I do, if you keep following along with me here on the screen, is if you

02:06.000 --> 02:10.480
type in the city that you're targeting, so let's say Queen Creek Concrete, and we go

02:10.480 --> 02:16.560
to the map, I like to just look at this and go, okay, you know, obviously we're trying

02:16.560 --> 02:20.840
to target these cities that no one else is necessarily, they're not on people's radar.

02:20.840 --> 02:23.240
So Queen Creek, I don't know, it's right here.

02:23.240 --> 02:30.240
So what are the cities and suburbs around that specific city we're targeting that are

02:30.240 --> 02:35.080
bigger, maybe people, they're more on people's radar that people would be willing to drive

02:35.080 --> 02:36.080
to?

02:36.080 --> 02:39.640
So I'm going to start from here, I'm going to start typing in Concrete Chandler, Concrete

02:39.640 --> 02:45.240
Gilbert, Concrete Mesa, Concrete Tempe, Concrete Scottsdale, even Concrete Phoenix, because

02:45.240 --> 02:47.640
that is not that far.

02:47.680 --> 02:51.880
A lot of these people, they advertise in Phoenix, but they're actually based down here.

02:51.880 --> 02:55.680
The majority of the people I know and have talked to in the businesses I work with, they

02:55.680 --> 02:58.560
don't live in Glendale and Phoenix proper.

02:58.560 --> 03:03.680
They live down in the southeast corner with Chandler, Gilbert, Mesa, Tempe, Queen Creek,

03:03.680 --> 03:04.960
they live down there anyway.

03:04.960 --> 03:09.680
So what I would then start doing is after you look at the valentine.app, some of these

03:09.680 --> 03:13.520
other tools, I would then just go use your same keywords and look at nearby cities,

03:13.520 --> 03:18.800
because if there's a business that's in Chandler, that's not a very far drive, and that's almost

03:18.800 --> 03:22.720
like a neighborhood, that's like a little suburb, if you will.

03:22.720 --> 03:25.040
So those are the first two things that I would do.

03:25.040 --> 03:26.040
Here's what you need to do.

03:26.040 --> 03:30.320
Ultimately, though, this is what it comes down to, is you need to make a decision.

03:30.320 --> 03:35.840
Let's say you do this, let's say you just still can't find anyone on Google Ads, or

03:35.840 --> 03:39.840
there's maybe one person, or there's one person, but you're like, I don't know, maybe they're

03:39.840 --> 03:42.880
a lead gen company, whatever, but there are people on Home Advisor, but there's just not

03:42.880 --> 03:45.640
a lot of people paying for Google Ads.

03:45.640 --> 03:46.640
You need to make a decision.

03:46.640 --> 03:53.480
I will tell you this, it is possible to sell to somebody who is not paying for Google Ads

03:53.480 --> 03:54.480
or advertising.

03:54.480 --> 03:58.200
Yes, I have done it, there are many, many people that have done that.

03:58.200 --> 04:01.800
And before I discovered how much easier this was, that's all that I did.

04:01.800 --> 04:03.160
So yes, it is possible.

04:03.160 --> 04:06.160
And so here's the decision you need to make, is you need to make the decision, especially

04:06.160 --> 04:09.800
if it's your first deal, is this worth the squeeze?

04:09.800 --> 04:14.760
Because you can turn any website that is producing leads into money if you try hard enough.

04:14.760 --> 04:16.760
But I'm looking at opportunity cost.

04:16.760 --> 04:24.640
So what I look at is, okay, given the situation, given this specific niche and city location,

04:24.640 --> 04:27.960
is this worth going after at this time?

04:27.960 --> 04:30.360
And here's kind of the rule of thumb that I would give you.

04:30.360 --> 04:36.400
If this, for me personally, if I find a city like Queen Creek, and you guys watched me

04:36.400 --> 04:41.760
do the due diligence, and it was absolutely ridiculously low-hanging fruit, there was

04:41.760 --> 04:47.240
no competition, there was Steve, Steve Wood, or Steve whatever, that didn't even have a

04:47.240 --> 04:51.800
website and he was showing up for everything, I mean, there was nothing, no competition,

04:51.800 --> 04:54.000
and there's search volume, and there's CPC.

04:54.000 --> 05:00.280
For me, where I'm at in my business, I'm going for it, I'm just full-setting, baby, I'm going.

05:00.280 --> 05:06.160
If this is your very first deal, however, my advice to you is if this is your first

05:06.160 --> 05:10.600
deal, and you do all this, and you cannot find people that are paying for Google Ads

05:10.600 --> 05:15.760
after you've done the valentine.app and these different tools, you've looked at nearby cities,

05:15.760 --> 05:22.200
and you're just not seeing that many options, my advice to you is skip it, earmark it, dog,

05:22.200 --> 05:26.560
whatever that term is, put it on the back burner, save it for later, and go find another

05:26.560 --> 05:31.960
one because the game is you gotta get your first deal, that's what we gotta do, no matter

05:31.960 --> 05:36.640
what that looks like, no matter what opportunities you have to avoid, what opportunities you

05:36.640 --> 05:41.240
have to pass up, we want you to get your first deal, because that first deal is gonna get

05:41.240 --> 05:44.360
you the confidence, that first deal is gonna get that mental barrier removed, that first

05:44.360 --> 05:47.360
deal is gonna lead to the second deal, the third deal, the fourth, the fifth, so my advice

05:47.360 --> 05:51.280
to you is if this is your first deal, and you start looking around, and there's just

05:51.280 --> 05:55.040
no one paying for ads that you can find, and you've done a lot of searching, you've tried

05:55.040 --> 06:01.640
all the different apps and tools and nearby cities, skip it, put it on the back burner,

06:01.640 --> 06:05.480
and come back, I want you getting your first deal, I want you to go into a city where there

06:05.480 --> 06:08.580
are hungry business owners, if you're somebody that has multiple deals, if you're somebody

06:08.580 --> 06:14.200
that is making a decent amount of money, and you see a city like this, like in my case,

06:14.200 --> 06:19.240
I am going to go for it anyway because I can afford to lose a little bit of money, I can

06:19.240 --> 06:24.160
afford to go in and run the risk of there's no one that wants to pay for ads because it's

06:24.200 --> 06:29.040
such a good opportunity that it's worth the risk for me, but if you don't have a deal,

06:29.040 --> 06:35.040
or you really need that first deal, my advice to you is save it, skip it, and we'll come

06:35.040 --> 06:35.540
back to it.
