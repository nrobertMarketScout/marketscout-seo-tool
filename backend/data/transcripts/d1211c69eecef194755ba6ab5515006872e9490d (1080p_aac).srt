1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,180
Another common question that we get is about the different types of search campaign

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:08,720
So people ask is a search campaign better than a call-only campaign

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,400
So in the training we set up two different ones

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:18,680
We set up the call-only campaign and we also have a video for the website search traffic with the call-out extension

5
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:24,460
I feel for the majority of the Legion stuff that we're doing that the website

6
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:30,100
The search traffic with the call-out extension is going to be the most versatile for you

7
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:37,580
It's going to give you the most utility for the majority of the legions that we're running having said that though the call campaign works

8
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:39,100
for things that are

9
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,540
emergency urgent 24 hours

10
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:46,700
They do have a place where if you're running a like a web search campaign

11
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:52,820
Oversay like a city area and you want to kind of spread out into a rural area that doesn't have a big population

12
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,640
Sometimes there's not a lot of call search

13
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:02,140
Competition out there and you can run that ad in those rural areas and it's really cheap and easy to do and it can just

14
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:05,860
Maybe get you a handful more leads per month, but you don't need to run both

15
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:11,780
You run them separate if you're going to do it, but I would recommend the website search traffic with the call-out extension
