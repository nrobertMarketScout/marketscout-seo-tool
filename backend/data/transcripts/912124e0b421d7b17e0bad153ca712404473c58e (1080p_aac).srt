Hey guys, another question that I get quite often is some of you are asking like how much should you

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:11,280
invest or how much should you spend in Google Ads before you give up on a deal? So first thing is

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,880
that's to me is that's the wrong mindset to have. You lose money when you quit, you lose money when

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:23,360
you stop. Yes there is such thing as learning and making mistakes and all that but that's why we

5
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:28,000
really emphasize hitting good due diligence, choosing the right city, choosing the right niche.

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,440
When running Google Ads there's going to be some niches that are going to be a little bit more

7
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:39,360
expensive than others. That's why we try to have a really good due diligence process and you get

8
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,320
a pretty good idea of that when you set up and run your, when you're setting up your Google Ad

9
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,920
campaign. With that being said, you know if I'm running like say like something like towing

10
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,840
where I need to have a lot of volume to make money, I'm going to probably spend a little bit

11
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:02,320
more money in the beginning to land a new business owner than something maybe more like landscape or

12
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,040
landscape design where I'm probably going to get less leads than I would for towing and I'm not

13
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:12,320
going to be spending as much on that. So that question is a little loaded where it just you

14
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,560
got to know your niche, you got to look at the volume. So that's why we use the data of search

15
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:23,360
volume, CPC and then we set our budget and that'll help understand like where we should be at like in

16
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,640
a month and stuff like that and then that'll give you that expectation of where you should be at.

17
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,920
Hopefully that answers that question.
