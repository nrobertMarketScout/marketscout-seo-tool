Hey guys, another question that comes in quite often, especially in the late fall and in the

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:13,440
winter for certain niches, is you guys are seeing that your CPC is increasing. So let's say you set

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:19,920
it up and your CPC top page bid is like eight to nine dollars and all of a sudden November comes

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:26,320
around and you're noticing that it's like doubling or tripling in price. We do see this in concrete

5
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:32,480
a little bit. Definitely a big factor in tree service and part of those reasons is just

6
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:38,320
understanding these niches and understanding the cycle of those businesses. So I can tell you with

7
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:44,640
tree service, typically the best time to trim a tree and or remove a tree is going to be in the

8
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,400
fall and in the winter because the tree's not trying to grow, it's dying, it's kind of dead

9
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,880
and stagnant. It's the best time to have somebody come out and lop everything off and trim it up and

10
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:01,440
all that so that it has a better rebirth in spring. So those bids are going to be more

11
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,000
expensive because this is when people are calling to have that service done. So it's just about

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,720
competition, it's about Google making money, Google understanding the market space, but that's why we

13
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:16,720
talk about you get these people for all year and you'll see that wave. It'll go high, it'll go low,

14
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,040
but there's an average amount as well. So don't get too worried about it. If you see it go up,

15
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,480
you'll typically see things like tree service, concrete, like spray foam, things like that.

16
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:31,280
You'll see them come in in certain waves, but at the end of the year you'll kind of see that it

17
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,320
kind of averages out.
