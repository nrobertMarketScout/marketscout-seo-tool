00:00.000 --> 00:03.440
So should I split out the ads, like for,

00:03.440 --> 00:04.920
let's say I do three ads for concrete,

00:04.920 --> 00:08.040
like one is driveway, one is cement, one is patio.

00:08.040 --> 00:10.540
Should I do it all in one or split it into three?

00:13.460 --> 00:15.240
So repeat that question again.

00:15.240 --> 00:18.160
So you're saying split the budget into three?

00:18.160 --> 00:21.700
Yeah, or make three separate ads.

00:21.700 --> 00:26.040
Like do only one ad that concentrates on cement keywords,

00:26.160 --> 00:31.160
do another ad that only concentrates on patio keywords?

00:32.440 --> 00:33.280
You know what?

00:33.280 --> 00:34.480
That's a really good question.

00:34.480 --> 00:36.080
I don't wanna give you guys,

00:36.080 --> 00:38.640
I would not wanna give you advice that,

00:38.640 --> 00:41.480
and I said this at the beginning of the call,

00:41.480 --> 00:42.320
this would be a question

00:42.320 --> 00:45.420
I would much rather fix it paid ads answer.

00:46.560 --> 00:48.720
What I would want you to do on this question,

00:48.720 --> 00:49.760
and I don't know if you caught this,

00:49.760 --> 00:52.880
but we're actually redoing again the training on the ads

00:52.880 --> 00:55.420
and also the entire training.

00:55.420 --> 00:57.180
But for this specific question,

00:57.180 --> 00:59.260
I think this would be valuable for everybody.

00:59.260 --> 01:01.700
If you would post that, just that simple question,

01:01.700 --> 01:04.120
say, whatever, post that in the group,

01:04.120 --> 01:05.540
and then if you want to go a step further

01:05.540 --> 01:07.500
and make a quick little loom and send it to me

01:07.500 --> 01:10.620
and fix it paid ads, I'll give you an in-depth answer,

01:10.620 --> 01:13.700
but I don't wanna just shoot something off the hip.

01:13.700 --> 01:16.100
So would you do that for me?

01:16.100 --> 01:17.260
Yeah, I'll definitely do that.

01:17.260 --> 01:19.620
The only reason I ask is because

01:19.620 --> 01:21.860
when you have targeted keywords for that ad,

01:22.740 --> 01:26.700
you get to that 100%, how good the ad is.

01:26.700 --> 01:28.820
You get poor, good, and excellent.

01:28.820 --> 01:30.820
If it's all related,

01:30.820 --> 01:33.700
you get closer to the excellent faster, that's why.

01:33.700 --> 01:36.540
My knee-jerk reaction is I would tell you

01:36.540 --> 01:39.300
to do a separate ad for each,

01:39.300 --> 01:42.580
because yes, that is the relevancy,

01:42.580 --> 01:43.440
that's really gonna help,

01:43.440 --> 01:45.580
and we've noticed that that's been a big thing

01:45.580 --> 01:47.740
with the way that we're doing ads now.

01:47.740 --> 01:50.660
However, I also don't want to,

01:50.700 --> 01:52.300
if there's somebody out there that's listening to this

01:52.300 --> 01:54.140
and they hear, oh, three ads,

01:54.140 --> 01:55.920
I would rather you just get them up

01:55.920 --> 01:56.960
than not get them up at all.

01:56.960 --> 01:59.500
So if that's causing analysis paralysis, no,

01:59.500 --> 02:01.540
but yes, 100% what you're saying,

02:01.540 --> 02:02.980
I think that is gonna be the answer.

02:02.980 --> 02:04.060
But I would love for you to post that.

02:04.060 --> 02:04.900
Let's get everyone's feedback.

02:04.900 --> 02:06.660
I'll get fix it paid ads in there.
