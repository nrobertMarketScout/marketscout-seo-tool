Chris asks, he says, is the one-pager borrow idea still an option or has Google started

00:05.960 --> 00:10.400
preventing that by giving you a message of plagiarized content when you go to run ads?

00:10.400 --> 00:12.600
So far for me, that's never happened.

00:12.600 --> 00:19.480
Now I do know that Daniela had an issue with one of her ads that she put up as a one-pager,

00:19.480 --> 00:22.680
but I know she was using a .godaddy or something like that.

00:22.680 --> 00:26.760
I don't know if it had to do with it being a .godaddy.

00:26.760 --> 00:31.720
I've never had any issues, so I'm still going to roll with that until I have an issue.

00:31.720 --> 00:32.560
I'm going to keep rolling with that.

00:32.560 --> 00:38.600
So as far as I know, and just so everybody knows, I still use a whatever it is,

00:38.600 --> 00:44.200
cityservice.weebly.com with borrowed content, right?

00:44.200 --> 00:46.760
Because I'm never going to index the site.
