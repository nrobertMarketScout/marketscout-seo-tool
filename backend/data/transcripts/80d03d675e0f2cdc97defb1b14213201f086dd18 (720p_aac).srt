1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
Okay. So guys, welcome to the call officially. I had a few announcements a second ago, but

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:11,760
welcome to the actual call. We got Porter on the call today. I know you guys have probably

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:17,200
seen him quite a bit lately and that's because he's been having a lot of success and also

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:23,360
because when somebody, you know, gets on these lives and is posting in the group, it forces

5
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:30,240
them to also have success. So it's a win-win situation. But what I want to talk about today

6
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:37,280
and why I wanted to bring Porter on is because I want to talk about Porter's path to 10K a month

7
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,360
and also remind you guys that this is while he's been taking over the family farm. And also I

8
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,680
didn't mention this because it would have made the title too long, but also while they just had their

9
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:55,760
first child, was it back in October, Porter? Yeah, October. October what? October 4th.

10
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:01,760
October 4th. So for the last two, let's see, October, November, December. So the past three

11
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:08,000
and a half months, Porter's also, you know, had the stress, obviously the excitement, but the stress

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,480
and the non-sleeping and the emotional wife and all that kind of stuff that comes with having a

13
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:19,520
child. So for those of you that are like, I'm too busy. I've got a ton of stuff going on. We are

14
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,080
all too busy. We all got a bunch of stuff going on. And I want to show you guys that even despite

15
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:30,560
that, that you can, you can go and get 10K. You can go and everybody should expect to be at 10K.

16
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,960
Okay. That's just the, that should be just the expectation, not to get your first deal, not to

17
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,800
get your second deal, but to get to 10K. And then from 10K, you can move up from there, but there's

18
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:44,480
no reason why you can't go and carve out a couple of deals. Porter, of your 10K, how many

19
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:49,040
deals is that? Is that 10 deals? Is it eight deals? Is it 12 deals? How many, how many business owners

20
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:56,960
are you working with or how many websites is the 10K spread amongst? I want to say it's seven

21
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:03,120
clients and eight websites. Beautiful. So one of your sites, one of your clients, you double dip,

22
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:08,000
got a two for one, the old two for, and then the rest of them are just a little bit over a thousand

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,280
a month. Yeah. Basically. Okay. Amazing. So Porter, when did you, so I've got, I've got a list of nine

24
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,720
questions that I want to ask you. I don't want to hog all of it with, with my questions. I want you

25
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:26,400
guys to be able to ask questions. I also want to let everybody know upfront that I know because

26
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,720
Porter's my brother, it's probably easy to be, to think that I've helped him with a deal. It's

27
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,520
probably easy to think that I jumped on a call with him to close a business owner, that I referred

28
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:44,000
him a business owner. Porter, between you and God, have I ever jumped on a sales call? No, not one.

29
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:54,400
Have I ever given you a client? No, not one. None. Have I ever, do, have I, do I even,

30
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:01,120
when's the last time you and I even talked on the phone? I don't even remember actually. Yeah. Yeah,

31
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,360
it's been a minute. Now, obviously, if I see Porter, you know, family gatherings,

32
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,480
dinners, stuff like that, and he asked a question, I'm going to answer. But if you guys, for one

33
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,800
second, think he's getting private coaching to get to 10K, he is a student like anyone else in

34
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,200
this group. Okay. Just so everybody knows. In fact, sometimes he probably gets less than anyone else

35
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,560
because I don't want it to seem like that. So I want to just set the record straight. Porter has

36
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:26,720
done this completely on his own, watching the training, asking questions. I've of course,

37
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,560
answered a few of his questions, but it's not like I just answer. He called me every five seconds.

38
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:37,120
So let's get into these questions. But I want you guys all to know that if you have questions for

39
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,160
Porter, I want you to be able to ask them. And let's just talk about his path to 10K, how he

40
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:48,960
did it, raw facts. I will let you guys know he almost hit it. Then he dropped back. Then he

41
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:54,320
almost got there. Then he lost three deals. It was quite a thing. So Porter, my first question

42
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:59,040
I have for you, dude, is what took you so long to get to 10K, bro?

43
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,880
I think that that's the, that's the golden question.

44
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:10,960
So hold on. Let's, let's, let's be completely honest. So you, I, I tried to get Porter to do this

45
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,120
years ago, like, yeah, whatever. And I was like, Porter, you should jump in. You check this out.

46
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,080
I'm making money, whatever. And I think in the beginning it was interesting, but you didn't

47
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:27,520
do anything. So when did you officially start, like actually went through the training?

48
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,600
So that was, I want to say that was like two, two years ago that I actually went,

49
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,160
went through everything. Like two years ago or last two and a half years.

50
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:45,680
It was November of, yeah, November of 22 years ago. 22. So just over two years ago.

51
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,680
Yes. So just over two years ago, that's when I got my first deal. So that was right when I got

52
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,360
married. So like, I was like, okay, I got to make some money here. Cause I'm not making enough from

53
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:01,440
just doing the farm. And so I got the one deal and I was so like excited. Like I remember you get your

54
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:07,200
first deal. And I just was like, I was like, this is crazy that I got this deal. So I really went

55
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:12,640
all in at that point, but I still had some, like, I was still nervous because I didn't quite

56
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:17,200
understand like how emotional it was like to lose a client. And so like, I went to this phase

57
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:22,880
where I went balls to the wall for like three or four months until farming season. And I almost

58
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:28,720
got to 10 K within that short amount of time, I got to like 9,000 or something. And I just didn't

59
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,080
know how to keep a client. I didn't know that they needed to be closing jobs. I just thought,

60
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,800
Hey, I'm providing the elites. They're not closing the jobs. And I still was like, I was losing

61
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,640
clients pretty fast. I lost, I lost four clients in two weeks. I was, I was devastated

62
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:50,560
because all my income was gone. So I remember Thanksgiving 2022, our whole family, we went to

63
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:56,720
Scottsdale and in Arizona. And I remember you and I did a live there. And I think even by that time,

64
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,360
you had already landed a couple deals because I wouldn't have brought you on live if you hadn't.

65
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,720
So you had already gotten some momentum and then you really, really did well. And I remember what

66
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:12,880
ended up happening is it was right before I came to Africa, 2023, you were getting really close to

67
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:18,880
10 K. You were like around nine. Was it nine or 87? Like you were close, right? Yeah, it was really

68
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:27,760
close. And then you lost four deals in two weeks. What month was that? That was in, it was right

69
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:33,360
before I started farming. So it would have been like March, March, April. Okay, great. So how'd

70
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,240
you lose four deals in two weeks? What did you learn? How did you lose them? What did you learn?

71
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,680
How can people avoid that? And by the way, this happens. And, you know, I was talking to Drew

72
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,840
yesterday. We were laughing about it. Like we call it the December slaughter, right? If you're not

73
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,040
prepared, if you don't have contracts in place, you don't have business owners that are happy,

74
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:59,440
if you've sat and rested on your laurels, you can really get smoked. I got hit hard for two

75
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,920
December's in a row. And I said, never, ever, ever again. And thank goodness it hasn't happened

76
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:08,000
like that again. But yours didn't happen in December. So how did you lose four clients in

77
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,640
two weeks? Did you send them anthrax in the mail, dude? I mean, how do you, that's impressive.

78
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,080
I don't even know. So one of them, it was the craziest thing. One guy just like, he stopped

79
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:23,440
paying me. And so I reached out to him. He blocked my number on like everything. Like couldn't find

80
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:30,720
him on social media. Just completely just off the grid. Yep. The next guy, I don't even know. He

81
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,480
just stopped, he stopped paying like one of his charge card. And I was kind of, it was kind of

82
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:39,840
my fault. I think I kind of was being like, well, I charged his card, but it declined.

83
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,520
Okay. And then you said he had a charge card. I was like, well, that's your sign, dude. You may

84
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,640
as well take it. No, well, yeah. Well, it was just weird, like the whole situation. So he's like,

85
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:53,360
hey, charge this card this week, charge this card next week. And then I charged the wrong

86
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,440
card one week and he was like, Hey, I told you how to charge it. I'm like, dude, I need a card

87
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:03,440
that I can just leave on file. Anyways, it didn't work out. And then I, one of the cards declined

88
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,760
and I was kind of like, dude, I need some payment or like, I gotta move on. Cause he wasn't responding

89
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:14,960
to me. Anyways, we kind of left on a bad note and anyways, lost that client. So a lot of them were

90
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:22,080
the fact that they weren't making money though. What I didn't realize was that I have to supply

91
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,080
the leads, but I also have to make sure that they kind of know what they're doing and how to handle

92
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,000
these leads because if they don't make money, they're going to drop me. And that's exactly

93
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,080
what a lot of them did. They were getting plenty of leads, but they were answering the phone call

94
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:39,360
wrong. They were maybe just not as bubbly on the phone with these customers and they just weren't

95
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,640
closing a percentage that would allow them to keep doing what we're doing together. So

96
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,440
what I've learned is even through this winter is just like, you got to start doing more weekly

97
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:56,240
contact monthly con on a zoom call. Like just always be checking in on them. And it's funny

98
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,960
that the clients that I want, the clients that are easy to deal with, I never talk to them.

99
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:06,400
Like it's weird because you think you need to have this like tab on them all the time, but it's the

100
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:11,760
ones that are like, so they almost get annoyed for me reaching out. Those are the ones that you want

101
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:18,400
to work with. Yeah. I've said that a handful of times for those of you that have been in this

102
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:25,040
group from the beginning, if a client does not make money, they will cancel. I don't care how

103
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,800
many leads you're giving them. I don't care how good the leads are. I don't care how closeable

104
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,400
those leads are. I don't care how much they should have closed those leads. At the end of the day,

105
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,560
if a client, if a business owner does not make money, they will cancel, whether it's today,

106
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,520
whether it's next month, whether it's next year, they will cancel it. And unfortunately,

107
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:48,800
it's not your fault, but it is your business. So it's not your fault that they're not closing,

108
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,400
but you do need to make it your business that they close deals if you want to retain the client.

109
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:58,080
And so some of us, we get these clients where everything works out. We send them a decent

110
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,000
amount of leads. They're good at closing. It's so easy. We're like, why can't we find more

111
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,640
clients like them? But what you're not realizing is that because they're making money,

112
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,400
it's eliminating 99% of the problems and the issues and the customer service stuff and the

113
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:18,800
touch ins. And guys, when a client's making money, most of the problems go away. I heard

114
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,680
this quote by Grant Cardone years ago. He said, if you want to keep a client for life, make them

115
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,960
money. If you want to keep a client for money for life, make them money. And I deal with the same

116
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:34,160
thing in this group, right? Same training that Porter used to get to 10K. I have somebody who

117
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:39,600
comes in, doesn't do anything, makes no money. And they want to blame me. They want to talk badly

118
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,880
about me. They want to blame the program and it doesn't work and this and that. And it's like,

119
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:47,520
dude, this is the exact same, literally the exact same training that this person, Ryan Dalton's at

120
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:52,800
$87,000 a month. And this person's complaining that my stuff doesn't work. How does that work?

121
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,240
Well, this person didn't make money. And unfortunately, it's not my fault,

122
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,640
but it is my business. And so that's one of the reasons why with this new 3.0 training,

123
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,000
which by the way, will be out before the end of Q1 for anyone that's going to ask,

124
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:13,200
my focus is on how I can hold people's hand to that first deal and make it my business, because

125
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:18,480
that's just the fact of the matter is they are. And in this case, obviously it's not like you

126
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:24,960
can cancel because it's not a recurring payment, but you can not give me a good review or not

127
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:29,280
recommend me to people, which is the same as canceling with a business owner. So number one,

128
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:33,760
guys, is you do need to make it your business. Business owners have to be making money.

129
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,360
We all have these business owners where they just, you talk to them on the phone.

130
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,560
It doesn't seem quite right. You're like, dude, that guy's never going to close a deal.

131
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:50,720
They have a scattered operation and we're like, well, let me just close the deal so I can post

132
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,760
it in the group. And we've all, the reporter, you've closed some of these deals, right?

133
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,880
That you're like, I'm just going to get the deal. No upfront, it feels good, but long term,

134
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:03,120
it's not the move, man. Now you just locked your area up for six months and that's only,

135
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,480
it's only going to last two months or three months or six months in one day.

136
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,440
And you're going to be back to the drawing board. And so sometimes as you, as you

137
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,960
mature in business, you start to realize that just because you, this is a line that I really like is

138
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:21,040
just because you can take money or just because there is money on the table, doesn't mean you

139
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:26,080
should take it, right? Not all money is equal. Not all money is good. Yes, it spends the same,

140
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:30,400
but there's money that comes with a lot more hassle and a lot more headache and a lot more pain.

141
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:35,680
It's not worth it. And so that's number one. Number two, really quick is I was talking to

142
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,080
Drew about this because he had his December, he had a few clients come in and he was like,

143
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,880
he had a few clients canceled as well. And guys, what you need to understand is that business,

144
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:52,480
what's this business specifically, what you're, what a million dollar a year company looks like

145
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:57,680
is it looks like a bunch of clients that have like been with you from years back.

146
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:06,000
So I'll give you an example. In 2020, sorry, in 2019, we signed a client. That was my first flat

147
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,520
fee deal ever. Right. That client was a great client. That person was low maintenance and they

148
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:16,720
ended up staying with me up until like last year. And then they ended up doing their own website,

149
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:22,400
whatever, whatever, whatever. Okay. But then in 2020, we went and signed all these new clients

150
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:27,600
because that's when we scaled up to six figures a month. And of those, I don't even know exactly

151
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,160
how many clients, but let's say there was, you know, 60 clients that made up a hundred thousand

152
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,000
a month, or let's say there was 50. I know there was more than that because obviously

153
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,560
they weren't all 2000 a month, but let's just make it, or let's say there was a hundred,

154
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:44,800
just to make easy math out of those, let's say a hundred clients. The next two years later,

155
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:51,280
so that was 2020, let's say by 2022 of that original hundred clients that made up my

156
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:58,160
million dollar a year company, there's probably, there probably was only 25 or 30 of those clients

157
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:05,920
that were still with me two years later. And what I had to do in year 23, in 2021 and 2022

158
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:11,440
is I was going and finding tenants or clients that were good fits, right?

159
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,600
Imagine you had a hundred homes, you had to get all of them rented out. You're not going to go

160
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,160
find a hundred amazing tenants that pay their bills on time, that have good credit score,

161
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,080
that are going to keep the house clean, that aren't going to let their dogs pee all over the place,

162
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:27,680
that aren't going to have sound and parties on Friday nights.

163
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,280
What's going to happen is you're going to go and get a hundred of these houses filled

164
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,720
and 25 of those are going to be the amazing clients that are going to be with you for the

165
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,480
next 10 years. And guess what you're going to have to do with the next 75? You're going to have to go

166
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,080
and you're going to have to go and replace all of those people with the next batch.

167
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:49,200
And then maybe of those, another 30 stick. And now you've got 50, 55,

168
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:53,680
really solid clients. Those 10 year, 15 year, they don't even want to buy a house.

169
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,480
They're super happy to pay you rent as long as you treat them good.

170
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:01,520
And what happens is over the years, guys, you start to build up this base of clients brick by brick

171
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:08,320
of very, very low maintenance clients that once you get to where I'm in, I've legitimately been

172
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:17,040
doing this seriously since end of 2019, beginning of 2020. So now I'm four years, five years into

173
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:21,520
this. Now I finally have those clients where you guys hear me talking about, yeah, I haven't talked

174
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:26,160
to that client in two years personally. Yeah. Francesca reached out because his wife got a

175
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,920
surgery. But other than that, we haven't talked to him. So just so you guys understand when you

176
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,800
lose clients, it is part of the game. Think about it when you get tenants. Yeah, they needed a

177
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,200
place to stay, but you're not going to go pick a hundred good tenants right out the gate.

178
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,640
And so that is just the nature of this business. There's going to be turnover,

179
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:47,840
but understand as you grow, take good care of the ones of all of them, of course, but especially

180
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:51,360
at the ones that are low maintenance, those are going to be your lifers. Those are going to be

181
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:56,240
the people like I literally have clients still from 2020. Four years later, it paid me a hundred

182
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:01,120
and thirty thousand dollars a month in my Stripe account, and they require nothing from me. The

183
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,880
only thing they want to do is they want to talk on the phone. How can we expand? You guys know

184
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:10,320
my Bentonville concrete project. I always talk about that guy's name is Brooks 2020. We signed

185
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,720
the deal. He has never canceled, and he messaged us like twice this year. He's like,

186
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,400
let's get on a Zoom. Let's see how we can expand. And he's like, well, I need to wait because of

187
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:22,400
this. So that's it, guys. That's the type of clients that you want. That's what's going to

188
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:27,040
happen. So Porter, amazing job for setting the record of losing the most clients in two weeks.

189
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,440
But lesson learned is that, like you said, your clients have to make money,

190
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,320
your clients have to make money, and sometimes the money that's on the table isn't the money

191
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:42,720
that you should take. Okay. So next thing I want to ask you, you started really hot,

192
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:48,000
right? You started, let's call it October, November. You landed a bunch of deals,

193
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:54,240
almost got to 10K, and then you took your foot off the gas. Now, I know part of that was because you

194
00:16:54,240 --> 00:17:00,720
had to go full time and with the farming and stuff like that. But what happened there? I mean, I

195
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,880
assume from the outside looking in, you kind of got the wind knocked out of you, kind of got a

196
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,600
little bit demotivated when you lost four clients, or was it mainly strictly to do with just being

197
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:16,560
distracted by the other, by taking over the farm? No, I think it has everything to do with I lost

198
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:22,160
four clients. I think being busy was an excuse, but I lost four clients. And it was like, I went

199
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:27,120
from making 9,000 to making like 3,000. And it kind of was like, it scared me a little bit. And I was

200
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:32,720
like, I got to hold on to these two clients. So I was almost like, what do I got to do to make sure

201
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,840
they're closing jobs so I don't make the same mistake? But what I didn't realize is like,

202
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:43,040
that's normal. And it's like, when you scale at a rapid pace, not all those people, like you said,

203
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:47,520
are going to be solid. So you just kind of have to keep the good ones and be okay with losing some

204
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:53,280
of these bad ones. But it was all a mentality of like, I wanted to get to 10K. And it was like,

205
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,680
that number was so big to me, like, because I wasn't, I mean, as far as like relevance with

206
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:04,240
money and like knowing how much a 10,000 is a lot of money, but like, there's more out there,

207
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:10,000
and I should expect more than that. I just was so afraid to like, hit that, you know what I'm

208
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,560
saying? I don't even know why it was like a mental roadblock. And then finally, I set a goal to hit

209
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:20,160
20,000, then I hit 10,000. And then I'm like, I just need to keep shooting my goals higher,

210
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:25,440
so that the goal that I'm going to hit is seems less than what I'm actually shooting for. Like,

211
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,080
it was just a mental thing. A lot of this is just mental. Like, if you can get over, you know,

212
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:34,160
spending the money, running the ads, being willing to make mistakes or lose clients,

213
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,960
and not take this so emotional, just say, Hey, this is just business. You're so much better off,

214
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,920
you know, I just was, I lost a trip when I was on a like, you lose a client while you're on like a

215
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:48,560
trip, or you're not around. And it makes you like, feel like you're, you're crappy, or you've done

216
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:52,560
something wrong. But it's in reality, it's like, it's probably just the client that you picked. And

217
00:18:52,560 --> 00:19:01,600
it was just a bad time. So so you went down from almost 10k to two clients, right? Yeah. And are

218
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:07,040
those two clients that you went down to still with you? Yeah, I still have them. Go figure,

219
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:11,920
right? Just what I was saying, those two clients, if you treat them decently, or good, or heaven

220
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:15,680
forbid, you treat them really good, those clients will probably be with you for the next five, six,

221
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:20,000
seven, 10 years. So that's what I'm saying. He went out of let's say, when he got to nine and a

222
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,040
half, he probably had seven clients, he lost five, right? The two 20% of his clients, or whatever

223
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:31,440
that number is, it's less than that. He kept two clients. That too, is his base that those clients

224
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:36,320
are lifers, as long as he does a decent job doesn't jack up the price doesn't the leads don't fall

225
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,080
completely off. He does a decent job, those clients are going to be with him. And that's exactly what

226
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:47,360
I'm talking about. So anyway, that's, that's, that is completely normal to happen there. And the

227
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,760
reason why you felt it so much is because you weren't taking enough action that you were

228
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,920
replacing clients as you were losing them. And again, we're not trying to discourage you and

229
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:59,600
say you're going to lose all of your clients. Absolutely not. If you guys go and pick good

230
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,440
clients, you shouldn't lose any of them. And if you take the time, but what ends up happening,

231
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,680
as Porter said, is as you're trying to get the next deal, you let off the gas a little bit on

232
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:12,000
this one, if they're not making money, then you risk losing them. Okay, it's just part of the game,

233
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:18,320
you got to expect it. How did you manage and how do you manage clients with, you know, when you're

234
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,880
in your busy season, and I'm speaking because I know a lot of people on here have other businesses,

235
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:28,560
other jobs, other responsibilities, and maybe times of the year, they get very busy.

236
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:35,280
How have you learned to manage your clients during your busy season, which is basically from

237
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,640
March to October?

238
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:46,640
Yeah, I think the contact with them is huge. I think at least once a month, I feel like the first

239
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,240
six months are the hardest. After you get past six months, you usually can

240
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,040
stop communicating quite as much. I still check in and make sure that they're getting the calls

241
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:59,920
they need and saying, hey, can you send me pictures, try and update the pictures, you know,

242
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:05,600
trying to do things. But I mean, in reality, it's just like, hey, are you closing jobs?

243
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:11,120
How many of these jobs have you closed? How booked out are you? Because if they're busy,

244
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,560
they're going to be fine, right? It's like when they don't have work, when they don't have stuff

245
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:18,560
that they can do, that's when they get all weird about paying you. But when they're booked out

246
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:23,600
three or four months, dude, they don't care that they're just trying to keep up. So I think the

247
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:29,120
contact is huge. But I really don't think that's even as big as just making sure, hey, are you

248
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:33,920
closing jobs? If you're not, what's the problem? And is it the leads? Because most of the time,

249
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:37,120
it isn't. Most of the time, it's something they're doing. Maybe it's the way they're

250
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:41,760
answering the phone, how fast they're calling the lead back. And I kind of try to help them

251
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:47,200
examine where that they've gone wrong. Phil felt found with another business owner. And then,

252
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:52,560
you know, I help them with that. And I've usually, I mean, other than if they're really bad business

253
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:57,840
owners, or, you know, I really have not had issues with losing clients like I did that first year.

254
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:04,320
Yeah. And that's another thing, guys, when you when you start touching in with touching base

255
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:10,720
to your clients, make sure that especially during that first six month window, that you're really

256
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,880
taking the time like that's going to be the most hands on you're ever going to be if you can get

257
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:23,280
them past the first six months, and re sign them into another year. Your your your chances of losing

258
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:28,240
them is going to be a lot less, it's going to go way down. So during the first few months,

259
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:34,800
make sure you're checking in monthly at the minimum by monthly would be better and weekly

260
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:39,280
would be amazing. And what I usually like to do is I like to check in, hey, here's how many leads

261
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:43,280
you got. And you'd be surprised how many business owners go, I didn't get that many leads. And you're

262
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:48,160
like, yeah, you did. And you should like, let's get on a zoom here, you know, whatever. And you

263
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:52,720
start going through it. And you sent them 20 leads, but they only answered 15. You just lost

264
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,400
five right off the top because they don't know the answer. Right. Just go to their phone. Then

265
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,800
of the 15 that they answered, they only booked calls with 12 because they don't know how to book

266
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:05,280
because the you know, instead of saying, hey, we're a bit out, but we'll put you on a cancellation

267
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:09,600
list. They're just like, hey, just so you know, we're 12 weeks booked out. And they completely

268
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,440
discouraged that they don't know how to talk to these people. And then of the 12 they book,

269
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,720
they have two that cancel before they come because they don't have any touches in between.

270
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:21,360
And then of the 10 that they they get to the house, they give estimates to all 10. And they

271
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:26,240
only follow up with none of them. And they end up closing, you know, so you start realizing and you

272
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,080
can kind of start getting into the weeds with these guys and seeing where they're going wrong.

273
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:35,360
But guys, you got to remember if you guys have read the E-Myth where it talks about most people

274
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:41,200
that start a business, especially in the trades, in the home services, these guys worked for

275
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,920
another crew. They either got mad at their boss or they were decent at their job. And they're

276
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:50,000
like, I'm going to go start my own crew. That does not qualify them to be business owners.

277
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,480
Most of these guys, even if they're really good at what they do, they do not know how to

278
00:23:54,480 --> 00:24:00,880
how to run a business. Some of the best craftsmen are the worst business owners because they just

279
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,680
don't know what they're doing. They're just they're just good at doing the thing. They're

280
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:08,080
not good at business. OK, so anyway, without getting off in the weeds, make sure that these

281
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,040
people are making money. That's the lesson and the takeaway that I'm taking from this.

282
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:17,360
OK, Porter, if you were starting today, took everything away, all your clients,

283
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:22,560
you just had your knowledge. You couldn't reach out to any of your existing clients or old clients.

284
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:29,280
How long do you realistically think it would take you to go from zero to 10K per month if

285
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:37,040
you started today? Really, like if I did if I did nothing but this, I bet three months I could get

286
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:43,120
three months. I get to 10K like that's two clients a month. Like I could easily do that.

287
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:47,520
I've been in a couple of months. I could do that. Yeah, that's two fifteen hundred ish.

288
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,480
That'd be a that'd be a stretch, but it's doable. I'll tell you guys this.

289
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:59,280
When in 2020 now, this wasn't just me, by the way, this was me. Francesca was managing most of the

290
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:05,680
sites. I had somebody that was when the leads would come in, I had somebody that was helping

291
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:10,720
me call and hook the business owners and I had somebody answering the leads and transferring

292
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,640
the leads. And all I would do was once the business owner was hooked and we found that

293
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,400
they were interested, I would come in, I would talk to the business owner and then I would close

294
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:25,200
the deal. So we had like a four man team in April, about mid April, like April 15th to May 15th. I

295
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:31,760
think if I'm if memory serves me correct in 2020, I set a goal with my team. I said I want to do

296
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:38,000
something crazy. I said I would like to add and I would like to add ten thousand dollars in new

297
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:44,560
revenue in one thirty day period. Ten thousand dollars of brand new revenue, no SEO, no paper

298
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:51,440
lead deals, only flat fee deals, new clients. And with that tiny little team, we did it. We hit it.

299
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:56,720
We took team golfing, had a good time. Interestingly enough, that's April, right?

300
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:04,400
Three months prior, four months prior, my total revenue was eight to ten thousand dollars a month,

301
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:10,240
most of that being made up by SEO and one flat fee client. So you can do a lot now.

302
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:18,320
Fast forward to 2021, August of 2021, in a single month, we added twenty four thousand dollars

303
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:26,960
of new deals, new monthly recurring revenue in a single month. OK, so three months is completely

304
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:31,200
doable. I think you could do three. I think anyone on this call, if you were actually doing work and

305
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,640
with singular focus and you were actually just focused on getting deals,

306
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:41,440
I think you could do that in three months. I do. Now, I think if you just started, I think that

307
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:46,240
might be a little bit very aggressive. I think for those of you that just started, I think you

308
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:50,560
get your first deal in three months, but you got to get the first one and you got to get the second

309
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:57,040
one in Porter. Once you get the first one, is it just me or is the second one come way easier?

310
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:02,800
Way easier. Well, it's just like a mindset thing. It's so funny. It's just like it just clicks.

311
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,240
It's like you can do it now. And as much as you've watched Porter talk about it,

312
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:14,240
as much as you've watched me, as much as you've watched Kyle or Jason or Ryan Dalton or whoever,

313
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:21,680
it's always like, yeah, but my situation is different. And it's not OK. Porter's got a kid.

314
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:29,440
I've got kids. Porter's got taken over the family farm. He also does stuff at his church he goes to,

315
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,960
which means he's got other responsibilities. He's got in-laws that he has to entertain

316
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,080
and he has to keep. I mean, he's got stuff just like everybody else does. So

317
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:44,320
don't think that you're special. Porter, what's one thing that you did right that you would do

318
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:49,360
again? If you started again today, what's one thing that you did right that you would do again?

319
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,000
That's a good question.

320
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,280
And if you want, my next question is what's one thing you did wrong that you would do differently?

321
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,200
And if that one's easier to answer, we can start with that one.

322
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:05,440
One thing I did wrong was... That one's always easier to answer.

323
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:12,640
That one's always easier to answer. I think a lot of it was my due diligence too. I think

324
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:17,600
picking... There's been times where I've just picked the wrong city because I was so like,

325
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:23,760
I wanted to get a deal so fast that I would say, okay, I got like 10 cities narrowed it down to

326
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,680
five and then I got like two that are like neck and neck and I really didn't know. And it wasn't

327
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:33,840
like a really like a yes. It didn't really scream yes, but it was still good. And I felt like I

328
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:40,080
should have just waited. I should have just really done my... Taken my time, got my due diligence

329
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:47,040
right because it saves you so much time on the back end when it comes to ranking and whatnot.

330
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:50,960
And it also helps you with finding clients. It's so much easier to find clients when it's

331
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:55,840
low-hanging fruit. But I will say you'll get caught in analysis paralysis if you're not careful,

332
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:03,360
so you can't just do due diligence for months and months. But at the same time, I was spending a day

333
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:07,920
on sometimes looking at cities and I'd make a decision in a day and I should have spent two

334
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:13,680
or three days going in and making sure that this was a good area. So I would say I definitely got

335
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:20,160
impatient and I was skipping steps within the course. And if I would have taken that time to

336
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:24,480
do it, I would have been better off. For example, another thing I did wrong, there have been times

337
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:29,200
where I've wanted to deal so bad that I thought that going into Facebook and going down in the

338
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,840
Google Maps section to hook business owners was going to be faster than actually creating a list.

339
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:39,520
And it is so far wrong. I would call business owners and I would get them on a Zoom call

340
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:43,440
and they wouldn't have money. And I was like, why are they they don't have money? But they

341
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,840
weren't running Google Ads. They weren't doing what you said in the course. But I thought that

342
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:54,000
I knew better that I could go there faster. And I didn't. And so I went back to the basics. Every

343
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:00,160
time I do exactly the process that's laid out, it always ends in a deal. And then I'm like, oh,

344
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:04,960
that's it. And then I get another deal and then I start doing something stupid. And then I lose

345
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:10,240
four deals. You know, like it's just like you got to stick to what works and stop trying to reinvent

346
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:16,640
the wheel. Yeah, it's that that, you know, the thing in sales, kiss, keep it stupid, simple,

347
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:23,040
or keep it simple, stupid. It's that whole thing, guys, I promise you. Everybody does this. You

348
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:28,640
thought that look, I've created a process. And by the way, this wasn't just it just didn't just come

349
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:34,800
to my mind from nowhere. I created a process from watching thousands of hours of content,

350
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:39,200
from buying twenty three thousand dollars in courses, from talking to people, paying mentors.

351
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:44,160
And over the period, a period of three, four or five years, let's say I started in 2016,

352
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:50,000
I launched this program in 2020 and 2021. So six years, I developed this process that is very

353
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:57,120
simple and it works. And if you guys just follow it, it will get you a deal. And at the end of the

354
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:02,000
deal, you can just start at the beginning and do it again. But everybody does that. They get smart.

355
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,480
They get they, you know, I'm going to I'm going to do this. I'm going to do that.

356
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:09,680
And the reality is, is there's a reason why this process works. There's a reason why you get why I

357
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,960
was able to use it to scale to six figures a month. There's a reason why it's worked for

358
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,640
hundreds of other people. It's a reason why Ryan Dalton's at eighty seven thousand a month using

359
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:22,240
the same process in two years. Just go back to the basics. I know that's such a such a boring

360
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:27,920
advice. You know, I always heard everyone talk about John Wooden, how every year he would

361
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:31,520
teach his players how to put on their socks correctly, because if they didn't do that,

362
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,920
then they would get blisters and that would affect every part of their game.

363
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:37,040
And then he would talk about the basketball. You talk about the lines and you talk about

364
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:43,360
the chess pass and the bounce pass. It sounds really dumb, but the fundamentals are what win

365
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,360
games. And so I think a lot of us have gotten away from the fundamentals, which is go into a

366
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:52,320
boring niche, go into a city based on the due diligence process that we teach you in the

367
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:57,520
training. And if it doesn't match exactly, don't go into it. And I know it gets frustrating because,

368
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:01,520
oh, I got to go look at another city, guys. If you're worried about the time it takes to do

369
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:07,520
due diligence, go use the ranking engine tool. It speeds it up a lot more. OK, but don't be afraid

370
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:13,680
to look at a hundred cities to find the one good city, because if you do that, that one city is

371
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,960
going to be a moneymaker and you're going to be able to rank it quickly. You're going to make a

372
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:22,080
ton of money on it and it's going to be worth way better than what Porter's done. And I've also

373
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:27,040
done where you just jump into a city and niche and it ends up being the wrong way. Guys, when we

374
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:34,160
started back in 16, I brought Kyle on back in 2018. He used to go, we had no sales process.

375
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:38,800
Basically, our meeting would be like, hey, all right, guys, go get some business owners. And

376
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:44,800
literally Kyle was just going to Google and just like typing in, you know, foundation repair,

377
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:49,840
Minneapolis, not even thinking about the state, not even thinking about, oh, I wonder if this guy,

378
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:57,040
just calling people. He ended up selling this deal, guys. He got this guy, shout out to Kyle.

379
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:05,920
He got this guy to buy 50 websites from us that we own. Great deal. It actually saved us from

380
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:12,080
basically going under because we were not very cash rich at that time. And I will tell you that

381
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:21,520
we just went and built, we went and built 50 sites. And I can tell you, not with 100% certainty,

382
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:26,960
but I would say 95% certainty that of those 50, I don't think we have a single one of those websites

383
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,800
that we still have existing on the interwebs. I think we got rid of all of them. We got rid

384
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:36,800
of the domains. None of them were built in cities where we were ever going to rank because it was

385
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:41,360
in the wrong niche. We got away from the basics, right? The only thing that got me to a hundred

386
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:46,960
thousand a month was going back to the basics, focusing on one thing, just like we talked about

387
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:52,640
last week, guys, eliminating everything else, simplifying my life, just working, not worrying

388
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,080
about the boys trips, not worried about the pickleball, not worried about the golf, not

389
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:00,160
worried about the Netflix freaking Tiger King and this, that, and the rest, unless it's the weekends

390
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:04,400
and just working. And that's how I made, that's how I completely changed my life. Okay.

391
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:09,600
Porter, we got a question for Joshua Archer. He says, Hey Porter, what was helpful as you worked

392
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:14,480
through the content? Did you watch and take a lot of notes, watch everything all the way through,

393
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,800
then repeat, watch one video, then act on it? Porter, how did you do it? And then I'll tell people

394
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:25,920
how I would recommend them doing it. Yeah, I can't watch the whole thing at once and then like wrap

395
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:30,720
my head around it. So like I'd watch a video and then I would do what it said. So like Nick said,

396
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:34,480
you know, pick a city. That's what I would do. I'd focus on the city and then I would focus on the

397
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:39,840
due diligence part of it. And then like the list part and then with content, like I guess,

398
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,480
I guess this is just in general, right? The content of the course. He's talking about going

399
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:49,440
through the course. Yeah. Yeah. So I would, I would just do exactly how fast Nick does it. So like

400
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:54,240
just watch the topic, do the work, do, do, do like a couple of modules, do the work and just do it

401
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:59,280
side by side. Just that worked for me. Cause that way it wasn't like overwhelming and I was able to

402
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:06,320
like see it from A to Z. Yeah. I recommend the same thing. Go through it guys. If I say to do

403
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:11,920
something in it, this is not because I'm trying to run a dictatorship here, but if I say to do

404
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:18,720
something, stop the video, do it. Right. If I says, Hey, go watch this video. Go now go. Here's the

405
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:25,120
due diligence. Now go pick your city in your niche. Do not go to building your list until you found

406
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:30,400
your city niche. And you guys might be stuck on build, you know, your city and niche for two weeks.

407
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,560
I hope it doesn't take you that long. Hopefully you can do it in a few days, but you might be.

408
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,160
And I don't even want you to move on until then. I don't want you watching the SEO. I don't want

409
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,960
you watching part two, how to build a website. What a lot of people do, dude, is they get into this

410
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,000
and watching the content makes them feel like they're doing something. Right. So they get

411
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,440
through the first part and it's like, Oh, now you gotta, you gotta pick a city in a niche.

412
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:55,040
It's like, well, let me watch how to build a list and then how to call the business owner.

413
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,800
And it's like, no, just do it as you go through it. And then by the time you've watched the

414
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:03,760
training, you've got a deal. Right. You do not need, by the way, if any of you guys are watching

415
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,200
this, you don't have a deal. You should not even be touching section two of the content.

416
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:11,600
It is not valuable for you to know how to rank a website unless you have a client.

417
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:16,560
Right. Oh, but I need to be able to talk the lingo and talk about that. Yeah, I get that. But guys,

418
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,680
you can go get a client without knowing how to do that. Trust me. Okay. If you don't have money

419
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:24,400
coming in, you got a hobby, not a business. Okay. Two more questions I want to ask you,

420
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:30,320
Porter. Now that you're at 10 K, what does your average day look like?

421
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:40,480
So I always try to, I always look at my phone to make sure that my Stripe account goes through.

422
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:45,200
So I always make sure that the payments, the clients that I do have are still paying.

423
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:52,160
I think I've learned now, something that I'm doing now is I'm trying to be more on top of it,

424
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:58,080
like having something ready to go next time. What I was doing before was I'd have a site or I'd have

425
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:03,200
a city and I wouldn't look for any new cities until that one was closed. But then I was always

426
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:08,320
a month or a couple of weeks behind because I didn't have anything ready to go. So I think

427
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:12,880
being prepared, that's something that I would do, like focus on and something I would do better

428
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:20,240
the next time around is be a little bit more prepared. But an average day, wake up,

429
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:24,640
make sure my Stripe account goes through, make sure the leads are coming through, whatever.

430
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:30,400
And then I'm just trying to find new cities because I don't have a team. So a lot of it's

431
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:36,080
doing it myself. So I'm trying to have cities that I can do, doing the boring stuff when the

432
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:40,240
calling is not available. And then during the day when the business owners are out and about or at

433
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:45,920
nights, I'll try to call them. But I try to do the boring stuff when you shouldn't be calling

434
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:51,840
anybody. But the prime calling time, make sure you save that for like hooking business owners

435
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:57,520
and trying to close deals. Yeah, I like that. And I would say the prime time should be the time you

436
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:02,160
have the best energy. When you haven't exhausted, like you don't need to go spend your best hours

437
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:06,960
right when you wake up and your brain's really fresh to go build a website, right? Spend that

438
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:11,040
when you're just ate lunch and you feel like you should take a nap. Okay. All right. Last

439
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:15,440
question for reporter is where are you going to be at by the end of 2025? And if you don't hit it,

440
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:19,600
we are going to slash your tires, something like that. So where are you going to be at, bud?

441
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:28,000
I want to be, I want to be at $25,000. I set a goal at the beginning of this year to,

442
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,480
well, it was part of last year, but I set goals like before the year ended, but it's kind of

443
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:37,840
rolling into this year, but I want to be at $25,000. So another 15K by the end of the year.

444
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,400
And I think about it because I was like, man, with farming, is that possible? But

445
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:48,560
even if I go to slow rate, even if I could just have something in the works every single month,

446
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,200
there are still times where I could close deals. And if I have a process set in place where I can

447
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:59,680
still be able to rank these out and have a team, then I don't think that's too far fetched. But

448
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:04,160
I want to be at 25 by the end of the year. Totally doable, bro. Because if you can go to

449
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:10,320
10K in three months from zero, then you should be able to hit another 15K and retain your 10K

450
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,920
and beat up to 25K. So we're going to hold you to that. There are a couple more questions,

451
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:20,240
but Porter, if you don't mind, if you don't mind, once we get off to go and just comment

452
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:24,000
and answer those questions on a comment, I think that'd be great. Like Shiju has one.

453
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,400
He asked about search volume. I will tell you, we just did a live on search volume. If you're

454
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:33,600
using RankinRent, the RankinRent engine, which I think we ended up saying to be very, very safe.

455
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:43,120
If the tool says 70 searches per month, on the main keywords, with a lower than $5 CPC, you're

456
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:50,720
safe to go. If the niche is moderately competitive, if it's very, very low hanging fruit,

457
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:56,000
you could probably get away with 50 searches. But nonetheless, guys, go watch that live. That was

458
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:02,160
back when Ryan and I did this. I was in Dubai. I think that was when, anyway, we called it the

459
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:06,640
magic number, the golden number on search volume or something like that. So anyway, Porter, thanks

460
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:11,920
for jumping on. Appreciate you guys being on, guys. Let's go. Remember, it's January. People

461
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,600
are spending money again. They're excited. They want to clean up their yard. They want to have

462
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:20,400
that fresh year. They've got goals just like you. Go hit up all your business owners. Let's go ahead

463
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,560
and see if I got a message back from my boy. If not, then I'm going to hit the next one up.

464
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,720
Let's just go ahead and see. I'm going to use that line you just did.

465
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:32,240
Tell me to eat sand at any point. Oh, dog. Here it is.

466
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:41,600
Here it is, bud. I'm going to show it to you so you guys don't know I'm not lying.

467
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:48,640
I don't want to show you the number, but how do I do this? Anyway, he just said right here, he said

468
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:54,160
it's today at 2.35, which was 25 minutes ago. He said, let's do it. Just got to set up a time.

469
00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:00,560
Boom, dude. He was paying us I think $2,000 a month when we were doing this. This is for my agency,

470
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:04,880
guys, of course. This isn't for new students. Again, let me go ahead and read that for you

471
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,960
because I do think it was quite nice if you guys want to use that line. I was going to use

472
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:14,160
something a little more vulgar, but I didn't. I said, feel free to tell me to go eat sand at

473
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:18,160
any point, but would love to hop on a Zoom or phone call and see how we can work together.

474
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:22,240
Look forward to hearing from you soon. Just so you guys know, the week before Christmas,

475
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:26,800
I hit him up with a message. It said, hey, let's jump on a call, see if we can work together.

476
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:32,080
It's radio silence. Messaged him on Christmas, wished him Merry Christmas or New Year's.

477
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:35,440
He responded Merry Christmas or New Year's whatever day it was, but didn't say a word

478
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:42,320
about my previous text. Hit him today now that it's January. $2,000 bills floating through the

479
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:46,240
ether. Guys, go ahead if you're a business owner or supporter, thanks for dropping on the call.

480
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:53,840
See you guys next week. Bye.
