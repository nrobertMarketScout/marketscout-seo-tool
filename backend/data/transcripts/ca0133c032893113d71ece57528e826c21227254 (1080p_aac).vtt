00:00.000 --> 00:14.360
So guys, we're going to be doing strategic follow up in between all these leads.

00:14.360 --> 00:18.280
We're not just going to send them five leads and get on the call and hope they've gotten

00:18.280 --> 00:19.280
a hold of them.

00:19.280 --> 00:22.880
So here's a couple of rules of thumb that I'm going to teach you that I do.

00:22.880 --> 00:28.360
Number one, I do not send and you are not going to send the second lead until they have

00:28.360 --> 00:33.600
scheduled an estimate with the first or the first has told them to go screw themselves

00:33.600 --> 00:36.120
because something happened along the way.

00:36.120 --> 00:39.960
Until the first is taken care of, meaning they have scheduled an estimate, they're not

00:39.960 --> 00:44.080
getting number two and they're not getting number three until number two is taken care

00:44.080 --> 00:47.960
of because what I've seen happen too often, and I used to do this, you go and you start

00:47.960 --> 00:50.880
pumping them three, four, five leads and guess what?

00:50.880 --> 00:54.020
They haven't even gotten a hold of the first one.

00:54.020 --> 00:58.000
You want to prove through your actions, not just through your words, that these leads

00:58.000 --> 01:00.460
are digital freaking gold.

01:00.460 --> 01:03.540
So don't send number two until number one has been taken care of.

01:03.540 --> 01:07.840
So what I'll typically do is let's say that we try to do the first live transfer, it doesn't

01:07.840 --> 01:08.840
answer.

01:08.840 --> 01:10.760
We do a three way text and I have another lead to send.

01:10.760 --> 01:15.000
I will call the business owner and I will say, hey, sorry to bug you.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
I'm not going to be annoying.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.280
And that's the other thing I want to talk about.

01:17.280 --> 01:18.440
Don't be annoying.

01:18.440 --> 01:23.040
I want you to be at the top and forefront of their mind, but you are there to help them

01:23.040 --> 01:24.040
not be annoying.

01:24.040 --> 01:27.840
You need to be persistent, but you don't need to be overbearing.

01:27.840 --> 01:30.800
So you're going to call them and say, hey, I have another lead that's come in.

01:30.800 --> 01:33.800
I want to make sure you got a hold of Janet first.

01:33.800 --> 01:34.800
Did she get scheduled?

01:34.800 --> 01:35.800
Oh, no, no, no, no.

01:35.800 --> 01:36.800
Not yet.

01:36.800 --> 01:37.800
Okay.

01:37.800 --> 01:40.360
Well, why don't you get her scheduled and I'll get this other lead ready to go.

01:40.360 --> 01:42.480
And as soon as it's scheduled, I'll send it over.

01:42.480 --> 01:44.580
Okay, guys, you need to be doing this.

01:44.580 --> 01:47.760
You need to prove to them through your actions that these are digital gold.

01:47.760 --> 01:51.680
And until you start treating them this way, the business owner is not going to take them

01:51.680 --> 01:52.680
seriously.

01:52.680 --> 01:57.000
Do not send five leads, show up on the Zoom call and then be surprised they got a hold

01:57.040 --> 01:58.120
of none of them.

01:58.120 --> 02:02.240
Do not send lead number two until lead number one has been scheduled for an estimate.

02:02.240 --> 02:03.240
Okay.

02:03.240 --> 02:04.240
So that's number one.

02:04.240 --> 02:07.840
Number two, as I said, do not be annoying, be persistent, be top of mind, but don't be

02:07.840 --> 02:08.840
annoying.

02:08.840 --> 02:09.840
You're there to help them.

02:09.840 --> 02:14.600
And if they have, if they're, if in the, the, this process in the live transfer process,

02:14.600 --> 02:16.440
they can't stand you.

02:16.440 --> 02:18.880
They're not going to want to work with you, but you need to be persistent.

02:18.880 --> 02:23.040
You need to let them know through your actions that these leads mean everything to you.

02:23.040 --> 02:24.820
This partnership means everything to you.

02:24.860 --> 02:29.580
And these soft touches in between each lead is an opportunity for you to get comfortable

02:29.580 --> 02:32.140
with the business owner, get that relationship with the business owner.

02:32.140 --> 02:35.740
Last point I want to cover, guys, is what's going to happen occasionally is you're going

02:35.740 --> 02:38.860
to send that first lead, okay.

02:38.860 --> 02:42.540
And all of a sudden you're going to get ghosted or you think you're getting ghosted, okay.

02:42.540 --> 02:44.580
You sent the first lead and you just can't get a hold of them.

02:44.580 --> 02:45.580
And they're just not responding.

02:45.580 --> 02:46.580
They're not answering your calls.

02:46.580 --> 02:47.580
They're not answering your texts.

02:47.580 --> 02:48.580
And you're like, what do I do?

02:48.580 --> 02:49.580
Do I send the second lead?

02:49.580 --> 02:50.580
Do I go find somebody else?

02:50.580 --> 02:51.580
What do I do?

02:51.580 --> 02:53.180
I'm going to tell you what to do.

02:53.180 --> 02:55.700
You are going to use a pullback, okay.

02:55.700 --> 02:58.540
And if you don't know what that is, you didn't watch the previous module and I want you to

02:58.540 --> 03:00.040
go watch it, okay.

03:00.040 --> 03:06.220
And if you want to refresh, go watch the module before and there's a video called the pullback.

03:06.220 --> 03:08.620
This is a perfect opportunity to use a pullback.

03:08.620 --> 03:12.260
And you're going to do something that I know it goes against the grain.

03:12.260 --> 03:17.000
I know it probably frightens you, but you are going to gain control of the situation

03:17.000 --> 03:19.500
because you are the one giving them leads.

03:19.500 --> 03:23.880
You are the one that has what they need and they're the ones that are basically through

03:23.880 --> 03:28.900
their actions telling you, hey bro, hey lady, you know, we're doing this on my time, okay.

03:28.900 --> 03:31.700
So you need to get control of that situation and you don't need to get too aggressive,

03:31.700 --> 03:33.020
but you need to be firm.

03:33.020 --> 03:37.620
So quick example, let's say I've sent one or two leads.

03:37.620 --> 03:38.620
These are good leads.

03:38.620 --> 03:41.220
I listened to them and now they're not answering, okay.

03:41.220 --> 03:44.900
I'm trying to get a hold of them to make sure they've scheduled number two and they're not

03:44.900 --> 03:45.900
answering.

03:45.900 --> 03:46.900
I've called them twice.

03:46.900 --> 03:47.900
I've text them twice.

03:48.300 --> 03:52.100
I'm going to do a pullback in the form of basically what I would, I would call this

03:52.100 --> 03:53.100
a breakup tech.

03:53.100 --> 03:55.500
So we're going to get into that later, but essentially I'm going to call them, leave

03:55.500 --> 03:59.980
a voicemail or I'm going to text them and say something like this, Hey Jim, Nick here.

03:59.980 --> 04:04.740
I, Hey, I've tried to get ahold of you for the past 24 hours.

04:04.740 --> 04:10.340
I have two or three more leads that are piling up and I can't get ahold of you.

04:10.340 --> 04:14.020
Look, if you're not interested and you're too busy to handle these leads and I'm just

04:14.020 --> 04:17.100
making your problems worse, no problem.

04:17.100 --> 04:21.460
But I need to know, I need to hear from you within X timeframe or I've got to move on

04:21.460 --> 04:22.460
to the next company.

04:22.460 --> 04:23.460
Thanks Nick.

04:23.460 --> 04:24.460
Okay.

04:24.460 --> 04:28.180
Something simple to the point, but something that slaps, something that freaking punches

04:28.180 --> 04:29.180
them in the face.

04:29.180 --> 04:32.500
It says, Hey lady, Hey guy, you need to answer these, my damn calls.

04:32.500 --> 04:35.940
You need to answer my texts because I'm the one that's freaking putting money in your

04:35.940 --> 04:40.460
mouth, putting money in your pocket, spoon feeding you leads in your mouth or I'm moving

04:40.460 --> 04:41.460
on.

04:41.460 --> 04:42.460
Okay.

04:42.900 --> 04:44.100
So this is an opportunity to use a pullback.

04:44.100 --> 04:47.300
So guys, just to reiterate, do not be afraid to use pullbacks.

04:47.300 --> 04:49.980
This is a perfect chance to use a pullback.

04:49.980 --> 04:54.820
And if you get ghosted at any point during the process of sending these live transfer

04:54.820 --> 05:00.220
leads, do the pullback, get control of the situation back and get back onto the sales

05:00.220 --> 05:00.820
process.
