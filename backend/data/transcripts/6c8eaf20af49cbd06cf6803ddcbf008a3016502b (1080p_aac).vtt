00:00.000 --> 00:10.160
Alright guys, let's talk about the 80-20 rule with ranking.

00:10.160 --> 00:14.500
If any of you are familiar with the 80-20 rule, I'm gonna mess this up, but basically

00:14.500 --> 00:19.160
20% of your actions make up 80% of your results, okay?

00:19.160 --> 00:20.320
That's essentially what it means.

00:20.320 --> 00:25.120
And so what I'm gonna talk about in this video is those couple of things with ranking that

00:25.120 --> 00:28.960
make all the difference in the world, that make up 80% of your results.

00:28.960 --> 00:32.880
Because with SEO, there's a lot of little nuts and bolts, there's a lot of little things

00:32.880 --> 00:36.160
that you can do, there's a lot of little things that supposedly help.

00:36.160 --> 00:43.200
But there are three, three core things that make up the majority of that ranking.

00:43.200 --> 00:47.720
And this is coming from years and years of experience, talking to SEO experts, studying

00:47.720 --> 00:50.640
SEO, taking countless courses.

00:50.640 --> 00:53.400
There are three things that really, really, really matter.

00:53.400 --> 00:56.760
I'm gonna cover them briefly in here, we're gonna go more into them in future videos,

00:56.760 --> 00:57.760
okay?

00:57.800 --> 01:02.360
I want to remind you, this is an art, not an exact science, okay?

01:02.360 --> 01:06.960
So this is one of those like soft things, it's not like a hard, okay, do this and this

01:06.960 --> 01:10.800
happens, it's, okay, we're trying to figure this out, Google's doing updates, Google's

01:10.800 --> 01:14.480
playing this ridiculous game, but we know that there are three things that matter more

01:14.480 --> 01:15.480
than anything.

01:15.480 --> 01:17.800
So the three things are as follows.

01:17.800 --> 01:22.120
Number one is the age of the website or the age of the domain.

01:22.120 --> 01:25.480
Number two is the backlinks, I'm gonna explain it.

01:25.480 --> 01:27.680
And number three is content.

01:27.680 --> 01:28.680
That's it!

01:28.680 --> 01:32.560
If you can nail those three things, you can understand those three things and you do your

01:32.560 --> 01:38.120
homework correctly on choosing your city and niche, you will have websites where you can

01:38.120 --> 01:41.200
do most everything else wrong and you will rank, okay?

01:41.200 --> 01:43.320
So let's talk about each of them really quick.

01:43.320 --> 01:45.280
Age of domain, very simple.

01:45.280 --> 01:46.840
How old is your domain?

01:46.840 --> 01:50.600
How old, how long has it been online?

01:50.600 --> 01:52.560
And here's what you need to remember.

01:52.560 --> 01:56.120
The older the domain, the better, okay?

01:56.120 --> 02:00.000
The older the domain, the better, because Google's looking at it and in their eyes,

02:00.000 --> 02:05.040
they think, well, if a website has been around for 30 years, pretty good chance that it's

02:05.040 --> 02:10.960
legit because who keeps a website around 30 years, whereas me and you, we come online

02:10.960 --> 02:16.400
yesterday or last week or last month or last year, we could be fly by the night.

02:16.400 --> 02:20.520
So age of domain is something that you can't fake, it's something that you can't really,

02:20.520 --> 02:21.920
well, you can't fake it.

02:21.920 --> 02:26.000
There are some strategies to buying seasoned domains and old domains.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.040
I don't mess with that because again, we're not talking about national rankings, we're

02:29.040 --> 02:30.960
talking about these super competitive niches.

02:30.960 --> 02:36.640
If we do, this is why I stressed so hard on making sure the city and the niche were on

02:36.640 --> 02:41.040
point in the very, in part one of the training, okay?

02:41.040 --> 02:45.320
In the very, very, very first module, that's why we talked about this and looking for layers

02:45.320 --> 02:49.480
because if we do that correctly, then these things aren't as important.

02:49.480 --> 02:53.320
But age of domain, just understand it's a factor and when you're doing your homework

02:54.280 --> 02:58.760
on cities, if you are going up against a website that looks like garbage and you're like, why

02:58.760 --> 03:03.800
are they ranking, it could be that that website's like 40 years old or 30 years old, whatever

03:03.800 --> 03:04.800
the internet started.

03:04.800 --> 03:06.600
And I've come across those, those are hard to beat.

03:06.600 --> 03:11.120
We cannot fake that part, so we have to do the other two correctly.

03:11.120 --> 03:13.760
We have to win at the other two, okay?

03:13.760 --> 03:18.120
Next thing is backlinks and I'm just giving a brief overview here.

03:18.120 --> 03:21.240
Backlinks, I'm gonna explain backlinks and first of all, if you don't know, backlinks

03:21.280 --> 03:26.120
are when you're reading an article, right, or a blog and it's like, yeah, we talked about

03:26.120 --> 03:32.120
this in our other post that you can see here and here is underlined, you can click on it,

03:32.120 --> 03:35.720
it takes you to another article, that's a backlink, okay?

03:35.720 --> 03:39.560
Within backlinks, there are two different types, there's a do follow and a no follow,

03:39.560 --> 03:45.160
I'm gonna be covering that in a future module and lesson, but there's a no follow and a

03:45.160 --> 03:49.920
do follow, do follow help, no follow, technically don't, but enough of that.

03:49.920 --> 03:53.120
Backlinks are really simple, understanding backlinks goes like this.

03:53.120 --> 03:56.800
You know back in high school or maybe you're one of the few in our program that is in high

03:56.800 --> 04:03.040
school and shout out to you guys, but in high school, you know, who you hang out with, everyone

04:03.040 --> 04:04.040
judges you on that, right?

04:04.040 --> 04:08.400
And I'm gonna give you an example, if you are somebody that hangs out with the cowboys

04:08.400 --> 04:14.160
or the cowgirls, even if you're not a cowboy, you are dubbed as a cowboy.

04:14.160 --> 04:20.160
If your friend group is the group that goes and gets high on the weekend or whatever,

04:20.160 --> 04:25.340
gets stoned on Wednesday night, even if you're not smoking weed, guess what?

04:25.340 --> 04:30.440
You're one of the pot smokers or the skateboarders or the jocks, right?

04:30.440 --> 04:34.640
Whoever you hang out with is who people think you are, even if you're not and it's the same

04:34.640 --> 04:36.440
thing online.

04:36.440 --> 04:40.280
Whoever you are linked to is who Google thinks you are.

04:40.280 --> 04:46.480
So if the game is really simple, how do we link ourselves to people or not in this case

04:46.480 --> 04:50.360
of websites of higher status than us, right?

04:50.360 --> 04:51.460
Status status.

04:51.460 --> 04:56.120
If we can link ourselves to, in a perfect world, if we could get a link from Forbes

04:56.120 --> 05:02.480
and Entrepreneur and you know, the New York Times, even though we're this brand new kid

05:02.480 --> 05:07.640
on the block, dude, Google's gonna go, that guy's with the, think about it, right?

05:07.680 --> 05:11.600
If you had three billionaire friends and you guys were just out slumming the town, even

05:11.600 --> 05:15.680
if you had zero dollars in your bank account, people are gonna go, dude, who's that guy?

05:15.680 --> 05:17.560
Who's that girl?

05:17.560 --> 05:19.800
She's in this group, she must be special.

05:19.800 --> 05:20.800
That's how Google looks at it.

05:20.800 --> 05:24.760
So we're gonna get into this, so don't overthink this, but backlinks are important.

05:24.760 --> 05:27.240
They're kind of that like steroid, if you will.

05:27.240 --> 05:31.560
So it's something that gives us that extra boost and there's strategies to getting those

05:31.560 --> 05:32.560
backlinks.

05:32.560 --> 05:37.640
You gotta understand that it's about getting linked to people that Google views as trustworthy

05:37.640 --> 05:39.720
and of high status, okay?

05:39.720 --> 05:43.780
And number three is content and that's the one that we're gonna focus the most on because

05:43.780 --> 05:44.780
of a couple of reasons.

05:44.780 --> 05:49.920
Number one, most business owners are not willing to write content and I'm actually talking

05:49.920 --> 05:53.160
about the words that go on the page, okay?

05:53.160 --> 05:56.960
Most business owners, when they think of writing content, they write a paragraph that's 25

05:56.960 --> 06:00.240
words, maybe a little review at the bottom from one of their customers and boom, they're

06:00.240 --> 06:01.440
done.

06:01.440 --> 06:02.720
But guess what?

06:02.720 --> 06:06.800
Think about it like this, Google does not have eyeballs.

06:06.800 --> 06:09.800
Google has algorithms that crawl our websites.

06:09.800 --> 06:12.280
They can't see what's on your website.

06:12.280 --> 06:14.220
They can only read.

06:14.220 --> 06:18.880
So how is Google, if you don't have anything besides 20 or 25 words of content on your

06:18.880 --> 06:23.040
website, how is Google going to know what your website is about?

06:23.040 --> 06:27.120
How is Google going to know about concrete contractors or that you talk about concrete

06:27.120 --> 06:31.400
contractors if you don't have any content talking about concrete contractors?

06:31.400 --> 06:33.360
Or concrete companies, right?

06:33.360 --> 06:37.920
Or the cost of concrete, or concrete St. George, Utah, or concrete near me.

06:37.920 --> 06:40.560
Yet, these business owners don't understand this.

06:40.560 --> 06:44.000
They don't put any content on their website because content is hard.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.200
Content takes work.

06:45.200 --> 06:48.640
Content takes thinking and thought and getting down and doing it and editing it and putting

06:48.640 --> 06:49.640
it on the site.

06:49.640 --> 06:50.640
It's hard.

06:50.640 --> 06:51.640
So we're gonna do it.

06:51.640 --> 06:52.640
We're gonna do it.

06:52.640 --> 06:53.640
We're gonna master it.

06:53.640 --> 06:54.640
We're gonna dominate it.

06:54.640 --> 06:58.880
We are going to win, mark my words and listen to me carefully, we are going to win this

06:58.880 --> 07:00.240
SEO game with content.

07:00.280 --> 07:01.760
We can't do a whole lot about age.

07:01.760 --> 07:02.760
We can't.

07:02.760 --> 07:06.440
But we can do something about backlinks and we certainly can do something about content.

07:06.440 --> 07:10.640
So when we get to the content module and you're like, oh my gosh, he's asking me to do so

07:10.640 --> 07:12.800
much, you're welcome.

07:12.800 --> 07:15.800
Because that is the very thing that's going to make the difference because no one's willing

07:15.800 --> 07:18.440
to do it and it's very, very, very important.

07:18.440 --> 07:21.760
Every word that we put on the page matters.

07:21.760 --> 07:26.320
Every word matters because it's exactly what Google is going to look at.

07:26.320 --> 07:30.080
And when I say look at, I mean analyze because they don't have eyes.

07:30.080 --> 07:31.800
These are algorithms that crawl.

07:31.800 --> 07:32.920
They read the text.

07:32.920 --> 07:33.920
They don't look at the pictures.

07:33.920 --> 07:35.680
They don't look at the website.

07:35.680 --> 07:38.000
So content is super, super important.

07:38.000 --> 07:44.080
So guys, I just wanted you to have a quick overview of these different pieces of SEO.

07:44.080 --> 07:49.120
And the three things that matter again are the age of the domain, your backlinks and

07:49.120 --> 07:50.120
your content.

07:50.120 --> 07:54.680
Now, as we get going, we're gonna be talking about on-page SEO and off-page SEO and within

07:54.680 --> 07:58.560
that there's multiple facets and we're gonna be talking about image optimization and all

07:58.800 --> 07:59.800
these things.

07:59.800 --> 08:03.760
But I want you to stay focused on age of domain, which you can't really control, but you need

08:03.760 --> 08:04.760
to consider.

08:04.760 --> 08:07.480
You need to be focused on backlinks and content.

08:07.480 --> 08:11.080
If you can master content and you can get good at content and creating keyword lists

08:11.080 --> 08:13.560
and writing content, and guys, it doesn't have to be perfect.

08:13.560 --> 08:14.680
We're gonna get into that.

08:14.680 --> 08:17.840
But if you can focus on those things, this is the 80-20 rule.

08:17.840 --> 08:23.460
If you can focus and master those three things, you will rank in the majority of these cities

08:23.460 --> 08:28.000
and niches if you have done module one, looking for layups correctly.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.080
All right, guys, let's go build our website.
