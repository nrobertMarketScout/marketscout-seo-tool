1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,360
So guys, we're going to be doing strategic follow up in between all these leads.

2
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:18,280
We're not just going to send them five leads and get on the call and hope they've gotten

3
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,280
a hold of them.

4
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,880
So here's a couple of rules of thumb that I'm going to teach you that I do.

5
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:28,360
Number one, I do not send and you are not going to send the second lead until they have

6
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:33,600
scheduled an estimate with the first or the first has told them to go screw themselves

7
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,120
because something happened along the way.

8
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,960
Until the first is taken care of, meaning they have scheduled an estimate, they're not

9
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,080
getting number two and they're not getting number three until number two is taken care

10
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,960
of because what I've seen happen too often, and I used to do this, you go and you start

11
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,880
pumping them three, four, five leads and guess what?

12
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,020
They haven't even gotten a hold of the first one.

13
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:58,000
You want to prove through your actions, not just through your words, that these leads

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,460
are digital freaking gold.

15
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,540
So don't send number two until number one has been taken care of.

16
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:07,840
So what I'll typically do is let's say that we try to do the first live transfer, it doesn't

17
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,840
answer.

18
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,760
We do a three way text and I have another lead to send.

19
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:15,000
I will call the business owner and I will say, hey, sorry to bug you.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not going to be annoying.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,280
And that's the other thing I want to talk about.

22
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,440
Don't be annoying.

23
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:23,040
I want you to be at the top and forefront of their mind, but you are there to help them

24
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,040
not be annoying.

25
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,840
You need to be persistent, but you don't need to be overbearing.

26
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,800
So you're going to call them and say, hey, I have another lead that's come in.

27
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,800
I want to make sure you got a hold of Janet first.

28
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,800
Did she get scheduled?

29
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,800
Oh, no, no, no, no.

30
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,800
Not yet.

31
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,800
Okay.

32
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,360
Well, why don't you get her scheduled and I'll get this other lead ready to go.

33
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,480
And as soon as it's scheduled, I'll send it over.

34
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,580
Okay, guys, you need to be doing this.

35
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:47,760
You need to prove to them through your actions that these are digital gold.

36
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,680
And until you start treating them this way, the business owner is not going to take them

37
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,680
seriously.

38
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,000
Do not send five leads, show up on the Zoom call and then be surprised they got a hold

39
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,120
of none of them.

40
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:02,240
Do not send lead number two until lead number one has been scheduled for an estimate.

41
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,240
Okay.

42
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,240
So that's number one.

43
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,840
Number two, as I said, do not be annoying, be persistent, be top of mind, but don't be

44
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,840
annoying.

45
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,840
You're there to help them.

46
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,600
And if they have, if they're, if in the, the, this process in the live transfer process,

47
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,440
they can't stand you.

48
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,880
They're not going to want to work with you, but you need to be persistent.

49
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:23,040
You need to let them know through your actions that these leads mean everything to you.

50
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,820
This partnership means everything to you.

51
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:29,580
And these soft touches in between each lead is an opportunity for you to get comfortable

52
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,140
with the business owner, get that relationship with the business owner.

53
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:35,740
Last point I want to cover, guys, is what's going to happen occasionally is you're going

54
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:38,860
to send that first lead, okay.

55
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:42,540
And all of a sudden you're going to get ghosted or you think you're getting ghosted, okay.

56
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,580
You sent the first lead and you just can't get a hold of them.

57
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:45,580
And they're just not responding.

58
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,580
They're not answering your calls.

59
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:47,580
They're not answering your texts.

60
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,580
And you're like, what do I do?

61
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:49,580
Do I send the second lead?

62
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:50,580
Do I go find somebody else?

63
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:51,580
What do I do?

64
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,180
I'm going to tell you what to do.

65
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,700
You are going to use a pullback, okay.

66
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,540
And if you don't know what that is, you didn't watch the previous module and I want you to

67
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,040
go watch it, okay.

68
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:06,220
And if you want to refresh, go watch the module before and there's a video called the pullback.

69
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,620
This is a perfect opportunity to use a pullback.

70
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:12,260
And you're going to do something that I know it goes against the grain.

71
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:17,000
I know it probably frightens you, but you are going to gain control of the situation

72
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,500
because you are the one giving them leads.

73
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,880
You are the one that has what they need and they're the ones that are basically through

74
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:28,900
their actions telling you, hey bro, hey lady, you know, we're doing this on my time, okay.

75
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,700
So you need to get control of that situation and you don't need to get too aggressive,

76
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,020
but you need to be firm.

77
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:37,620
So quick example, let's say I've sent one or two leads.

78
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:38,620
These are good leads.

79
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:41,220
I listened to them and now they're not answering, okay.

80
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,900
I'm trying to get a hold of them to make sure they've scheduled number two and they're not

81
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:45,900
answering.

82
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:46,900
I've called them twice.

83
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:47,900
I've text them twice.

84
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:52,100
I'm going to do a pullback in the form of basically what I would, I would call this

85
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,100
a breakup tech.

86
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,500
So we're going to get into that later, but essentially I'm going to call them, leave

87
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,980
a voicemail or I'm going to text them and say something like this, Hey Jim, Nick here.

88
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:04,740
I, Hey, I've tried to get ahold of you for the past 24 hours.

89
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:10,340
I have two or three more leads that are piling up and I can't get ahold of you.

90
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:14,020
Look, if you're not interested and you're too busy to handle these leads and I'm just

91
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:17,100
making your problems worse, no problem.

92
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:21,460
But I need to know, I need to hear from you within X timeframe or I've got to move on

93
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:22,460
to the next company.

94
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,460
Thanks Nick.

95
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:24,460
Okay.

96
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:28,180
Something simple to the point, but something that slaps, something that freaking punches

97
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,180
them in the face.

98
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:32,500
It says, Hey lady, Hey guy, you need to answer these, my damn calls.

99
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,940
You need to answer my texts because I'm the one that's freaking putting money in your

100
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:40,460
mouth, putting money in your pocket, spoon feeding you leads in your mouth or I'm moving

101
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,460
on.

102
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,460
Okay.

103
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,100
So this is an opportunity to use a pullback.

104
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,300
So guys, just to reiterate, do not be afraid to use pullbacks.

105
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,980
This is a perfect chance to use a pullback.

106
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:54,820
And if you get ghosted at any point during the process of sending these live transfer

107
00:04:54,820 --> 00:05:00,220
leads, do the pullback, get control of the situation back and get back onto the sales

108
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:00,820
process.
