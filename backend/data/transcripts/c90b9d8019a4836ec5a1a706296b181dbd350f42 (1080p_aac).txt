Sean, how long do Google ads need to run to start expecting call that's a that's a really hard question to answer because it depends on time of year market, aka recession news.
It depends on are you running smarter search like Jeff's talking about right now. What niche are you in was your I mean there's a million things.
I've seen the leads come in in, you know, lead slash forms come in, literally in hours, and I've seen some that take two weeks, and it's because of you know there's no impressions because it's a weird time of year or I didn't realize it was freaking
And I'm running concrete ads and oh that makes sense and I what's ice storm no wonder no one's calling about concrete. So that's really loaded question but if everything's dial, it can be anywhere from a couple hours to, you know, I'd say 10 to 14 days.
But as long as is you know if you're getting impressions, you just have to reverse engineer if you're getting impressions but not clicks. What's going on if you're getting clicks but not cause what's going on and you just need to look reverse engineer, you're good.
