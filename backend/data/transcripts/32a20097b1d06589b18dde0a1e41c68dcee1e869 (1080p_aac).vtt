Hey, guys, we're shooting this extra video clip to go over using keyword planner, a Google keyword planner to set your CPC limit for your bids in the original video that you saw when we did it for whatever reason, it was showing really not a lot of great data for Bentonville, Arkansas for concrete, even though we all know that there is CPC and we can see it.

00:22.320 --> 00:30.320
So we want to just make an extra one just to show you what you'll more likely see so you understand what to do when that is happening.

00:30.320 --> 00:39.320
Okay, so in this example, I just did Val Dosta, Georgia tree service tree removal and tree trimming ran it and you can see here.

00:39.320 --> 00:42.320
These are my metrics that I'm getting.

00:42.320 --> 00:47.320
We have our three main keywords tree service tree removal and tree trimming.

00:47.320 --> 00:50.320
We have some search term here tree service near me.

00:50.320 --> 00:56.320
We have some search term and you can see here you have top of page bid and low range and the high range.

00:56.320 --> 00:57.320
Okay.

00:57.320 --> 01:02.320
And then when I go through here, I look at my CPC for my main keywords and I have 781.

01:02.320 --> 01:05.320
I have eleven dollars that have eight forty seven.

01:05.320 --> 01:11.320
I have five seventy five eight eight twelve eleven ninety one.

01:11.320 --> 01:12.320
That's for land clearing.

01:12.320 --> 01:19.320
So that may not be relevant to my my my customer or my client stump grinding is really cheap.

01:19.320 --> 01:23.320
And tree pruning as well eight forty seven tree stump removal.

01:23.320 --> 01:25.320
That's eight eight twelve.

01:25.320 --> 01:29.320
So you can see most things are in that eight to nine dollar range, which isn't too bad for tree service.

01:29.320 --> 01:30.320
Okay.

01:30.320 --> 01:33.320
You have a few bump ups into eleven dollars.

01:33.320 --> 01:42.320
So some of this is going to be when you have this kind of variance in your limits, you you kind of have to decide what you want to do.

01:42.320 --> 01:48.320
And my advice is always going to be I take my my highest top of page bid on the high range.

01:48.320 --> 01:50.320
And I bid one penny more.

01:50.320 --> 01:55.320
Now, here I have eleven dollars and down here I have eleven ninety one.

01:55.320 --> 01:56.320
But this is for land clearing.

01:56.320 --> 02:01.320
And I don't really want to get into that unless I have a client that specifically wants that.

02:01.320 --> 02:03.320
So I'm not going to use that into my factory in here.

02:03.320 --> 02:08.320
But everything else is in this eight dollar nine dollar range, a few that are a little smaller.

02:08.320 --> 02:12.320
And then I get to the eleven dollars for tree removal near me.

02:12.320 --> 02:15.320
Now, again, that's a very valuable keyword.

02:16.320 --> 02:18.320
So Google's telling you that's a premium keyword, right?

02:18.320 --> 02:24.320
So if I was setting this up, I would set up my max CPC bid to eleven oh one.

02:24.320 --> 02:29.320
If for some reason you said that's way too expensive for me and I'm not going to do it, that's OK.

02:29.320 --> 02:33.320
You can see that you still have potential to win a bid here in the range.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.320
The low range is three twenty.

02:35.320 --> 02:37.320
The high range is eleven.

02:37.320 --> 02:43.320
OK, I can tell you from most of my experience, you rarely see a top of page high.

02:43.320 --> 02:51.320
The high range of the top of page bid, unless you're in a very competitive competitive niche and a competitive area.

02:51.320 --> 02:56.320
But with that, if you wanted to take out the eleven dollar one, then I would just drop down to my next highest one,

02:56.320 --> 02:59.320
which I think might be this tree trimming one at eight forty seven.

02:59.320 --> 03:01.320
Let me verify that.

03:03.320 --> 03:04.320
And that would be that.

03:04.320 --> 03:06.320
So I would bid eight forty eight.

03:06.320 --> 03:10.320
OK, and that would give you most of these main keywords that you want.

03:10.320 --> 03:15.320
You may lose out on some of these premium ones right here, but you're going to be in the hunt for them.

03:15.320 --> 03:17.320
OK, so that's how I would deal with that.

03:17.320 --> 03:18.320
That's a common question we get.

03:18.320 --> 03:21.320
So we want to just make this video to address it for you guys.

03:21.320 --> 03:22.320
Thanks.
