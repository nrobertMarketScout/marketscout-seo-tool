1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,280
In order to get to 90% plus close rate,

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,480
how much pre-qualification do you do before jumping

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:06,880
on a Zoom with a business owner?

4
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,440
Other than average profits.

5
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,560
Dude, Irving, you and Eugene, by the way,

6
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,400
for anyone that doesn't know,

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,280
Eugene and Irving are their partners.

8
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,640
You're gonna get to a point,

9
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,440
and you guys have been doing this for a while now,

10
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,560
but just keep making offers, keep doing Zoom calls.

11
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,120
You're gonna get to a point, Irving,

12
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:29,280
where you're gonna know with like 98% certainty

13
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,840
whether you're getting the deal or not.

14
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,200
And it's like a soft skill.

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,680
It's gonna be impossible for me to say,

16
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,560
yeah, when they say this, this, this, and this guarantee,

17
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,100
you're gonna do enough of these.

18
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,400
And I've done enough where I know by the way

19
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,920
they're talking, the way they're texting,

20
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,960
the way they're interacting, the tone of their voice,

21
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,640
how many leads I've sent them, timing.

22
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,680
I know if I'm getting the deal.

23
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,600
And guys, it's to the point now,

24
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,880
excuse me, it got to the point in late 2021

25
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,400
when we were going super hard.

26
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:00,800
I, like guys, I didn't lose deals.

27
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,120
Like I just didn't like ever lose deals.

28
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:09,120
Like you, but I also knew what I was looking for

29
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,680
and I only got on Zoom calls with people who were my fit.

30
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,960
So my advice to you would be,

31
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,800
you guys are doing this already,

32
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,400
take really good notes of like, okay, I closed this guy.

33
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,640
What are some of the things that were consistent there?

34
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,040
Okay, he said this, he said this,

35
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,880
we sent him three leads, he closed one.

36
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,840
And it was over this period.

37
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,640
And I know Eugene's really good at keeping track

38
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,480
of that kind of stuff.

39
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,360
But it's just one of those things that's a soft skill.

40
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,200
You're gonna learn it.

41
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,280
It's really hard to teach it without the experience.

42
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,840
But you guys are doing enough deals.

43
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,020
You're getting up to bad enough

44
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,520
where you're gonna be learning that.
