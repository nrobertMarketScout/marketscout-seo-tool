1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,880
So guys, let's talk about the zoom clothes really quick and when to schedule it said

2
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,480
I want to I want to reiterate and you know spring this up again.

3
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,180
I've talked about this already.

4
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:23,520
It's not when to actually do the clothes is going to be more of a gut feeling than it

5
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,840
is an exact science.

6
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,840
Okay.

7
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,640
It's not you know necessarily after X amount of leads on this day and blah blah blah.

8
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,640
It's not like that.

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,640
Okay.

10
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,640
It's you're going to feel it.

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,640
You're going to know the customer is going to start saying things.

12
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,080
They're going to start acting a certain way and you're just going to feel hey it's time

13
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,800
to go and when the iron is hot it's time to strike.

14
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,800
Okay.

15
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,800
And sometimes it's going to be inconvenient.

16
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,200
Sometimes you're going to be leaving for Cancun tomorrow at nine in the morning and you're

17
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,360
going to need to wake up early to do the call close the deal and get to the airport on time

18
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,360
and it sucks.

19
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,360
Okay.

20
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,320
But you know what it feels that flight is a lot better when I've made money than when

21
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,320
I have it.

22
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,320
So I deal with it.

23
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,320
Okay.

24
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,320
That's number one.

25
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,120
The other thing I want to bring this up here is we want to make sure to send the screencast

26
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,120
the night before.

27
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,960
Want to give them at least 24 hours to watch this screencast.

28
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:06,960
Okay.

29
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,320
So let's say for example that tomorrow was because today is actually Wednesday.

30
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,320
Let's say tomorrow's Thursday.

31
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,080
We're supposed to do the call tomorrow at noon.

32
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,080
Okay.

33
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:22,480
I would want to make sure that my screencast was made and sent within at least 24 hours

34
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:28,480
before and I would send them have it attached to a software that tracks it and I would want

35
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,480
to give them 24 hours to watch this video but I would want to schedule it you know for

36
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:36,080
tomorrow at noon and I would want to send it before 24 hours before.

37
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,080
Okay.

38
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,080
Very very simple.

39
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:42,120
The other thing I want to mention is make sure that's actually kind of a bad example

40
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:47,640
because I like to make sure and schedule my zoom closes either first thing in the morning

41
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,640
or in the evening.

42
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,640
Okay.

43
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,560
Morning is always better but I'm talking their morning.

44
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,880
So I'm you know mountain time if I'm doing someone in the eastern time I'm doing these

45
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:01,480
calls early and the reason why is guys when you set appointments for their lunch break

46
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:06,520
life happens man business happens employee problems and I got hung up on a job and blah

47
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,520
and then they're just like do I really want to deal with this do I really want to take

48
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,600
time out of my day to get pitched but if you do it first thing in the morning and it's

49
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,640
like before they go out to work they're going to they've already agreed to it.

50
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,640
That's a different story.

51
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,640
Okay.

52
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,280
On top of that when you do it in the middle of the day.

53
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,640
What are they going to actually what are going to carry their laptop and catch you in the

54
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,320
parking lot of a 7-eleven.

55
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,320
You know what I mean.

56
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:31,320
But at night or in the morning they're at their house they're at least on their laptop

57
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:35,440
or even if it's their phone but they're sitting down and they're able to focus.

58
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,600
Another great time to schedule these on Saturdays okay.

59
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:42,780
For me personally Saturdays are a day that I work on my business not in my business and

60
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,080
so for some of these business owners that's exactly what they do Saturday they don't got

61
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,040
employees they don't have Saturdays they don't have employees calling them ringing

62
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,440
them up customers aren't calling them as much.

63
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,360
So Saturdays are also a really good time to schedule these last few things I want to mention

64
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:03,280
here that are best practices is make sure to let them know like it's a very simple process

65
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,400
some of these people they get really scared when you talk about zoom in a video call and

66
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,200
just let them know say hey we're going to talk tomorrow what I'm going to do is I'm

67
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,200
going to send you an email it's going to have a link and all you're going to do is it's

68
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,920
really simple Mr. Business Owner you're just going to click on the link and it's going

69
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:21,080
to take you to a video okay really simple don't stress it and by the way if we have

70
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,620
problems we'll deal with it but it's not as complicated as it sounds so that's number

71
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:31,520
one is I let them know that and make sure and we'll talk about this in future videos

72
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:36,680
make sure that you can see their face and you can hear their voice because if I have

73
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,260
to get on and pitch somebody that won't even show their face how do you think I'm going

74
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,360
to get a credit card from somebody that won't even show their face okay.

75
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,400
So these are just some of the best practices with setting up the zoom clothes and when

76
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,640
to send the screencast so in recap set up the zoom clothes for morning or night when

77
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,880
they're at home focused make sure they're at a desktop okay make sure that they understand

78
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,080
zoom is going to be very simple it's going to be them clicking on a button make sure

79
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:05,200
you can see their face make sure you can hear their voice and make sure they've watched

80
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,920
the screencast that you just created that's 10 minutes or less that they've watched that

81
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:14,440
or sorry at least 24 hours before or you've sent that sent it to them 24 hours before

82
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:19,880
and they have watched the screencast before you get if you don't do this guys you're you're

83
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:24,720
every one of these things that you don't do you can still close deals and you probably

84
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,240
will still close deals by skipping steps but the more of these things that you do the closer

85
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,840
to this process the higher the chance of you actually getting the deal
