1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
All right, guys, welcome to the call.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,080
I've got my notes over here.

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,080
There's a couple things.

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,880
Let me move this onto my screen here.

5
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:13,360
There's a few things I want to just make sure to cover really, really quick.

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,360
Let's see.

7
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,360
Okay.

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,360
Two things I want to cover quick.

9
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,480
Then I'm going to have Mr. Zach Palcomano talk about hiring.

10
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:24,480
We're going to be talking about how leverage, how to scale through hiring, okay?

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,960
How to duplicate yourself and actually build a business that you don't have to be a slave

12
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,040
to, okay?

13
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:37,760
So, number one, I was looking yesterday through the ... I was going through the training

14
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,760
yesterday myself.

15
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:44,720
Some of you guys know, or most of you guys should know, I am in the process of redoing

16
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:51,380
the training and not just reshooting the training, but redoing the way that we do this training,

17
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:55,160
the way that the whole experience, the way that we hold everyone accountable, the way

18
00:00:55,160 --> 00:01:01,080
that we track out the progress of everybody, the way that the content is delivered.

19
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:07,040
I'm really, really excited about it, and it's ironic because the way that we planned on

20
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:14,280
doing it seemed kind of outside the box, and it seemed a bit weird because I hadn't seen

21
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,440
anybody do it, and I got to give credit to Aaron because Aaron's the one that initially

22
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:24,480
came with the idea, and then I was like, okay, I'm with you, even though it's not the way

23
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,800
that anybody I've seen is doing it, none of the big guys that whatever.

24
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:38,800
And then, I had ... there's somebody I really, really respect that has a very, very expensive

25
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:48,160
program, a $30,000 plus program, and I found out they're using this exact same kind of

26
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:52,240
system that we're going to be using, so I'm very, very excited, and just before anyone

27
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,400
asks, because I know you guys are excited, it's going to be out sometime in quarter one,

28
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:03,040
okay? Now, I'm not sure. I'm giving myself those three months just so that I have proper time.

29
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,520
I don't just want to fling something out. I want to have this thing be proper, so that's the goal.

30
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,840
That means that it could come out the last day of March. It also could come out sometime in

31
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:18,320
January. It could come out sometime in February. My goal is to get it done as quickly as possible,

32
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:23,280
as well as make sure that it is properly done. So, for those of you that are sitting there going,

33
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,560
I'm going to wait until version 3.0. Guys, there is going to be nothing in version 3.0

34
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,040
that is going to be some magic bullet that's going to make you a millionaire, okay?

35
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:39,360
There are people in this group, aka Ryan Dalton, that have used the information that is here right

36
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,400
now. That is, he's at $87,000 per month. There's another person I want to give a shout out to

37
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:50,240
really quick, Mr. Drew Wolber, who messaged me yesterday. We were talking, and he sent me a

38
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:59,360
screenshot of his, I think it was his Stripe account. He is approaching $50,000 per month,

39
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,560
and he just started. I was like, how did Drew join? I went in, I looked, he joined just over

40
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,600
a year ago, okay? So, for anyone sitting there going, oh, there's nothing missing. The training

41
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:14,960
is the same training, exactly what I used to get to Seven Figures. It's what Ryan's used to get the

42
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:19,360
Seven Figure run rate. It's what Drew used to get to $50,000. It's what Juan Finesse used to get to

43
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,480
$40,000. It's what Mike Veas used to get to $40,000. There's nothing missing, but I am excited to give

44
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,840
you guys something and deliver it differently that's outside the box, that's going to be a bit,

45
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,840
it's going to be a breath of fresh air. So, I just don't want you guys to sit around going,

46
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,840
I'm going to wait until the next one. No, go get some money. Go make some money right now. Go get

47
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:44,960
deals. Don't take your foot off the gas right now. It's December, but this is the perfect time

48
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,320
to put your foot on the gas, stomp on some throats, and go make some money, okay?

49
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,120
That said, I was looking at the training yesterday as I was going through version 2.0,

50
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,880
and I was looking, and we have our core training, which is digital landlords, which is how to get

51
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:06,560
the deal all the way to the sales FAQ, the ads FAQ, and then how to build the website, how to

52
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,560
rank the website, all of the technical stuff, okay, which we're going to be adding a lot more

53
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:17,280
information to on version 3.0. And I remembered that we have this other section called the premium

54
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,280
sales training library, which obviously I, of course, always knew that because I have a little

55
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:26,080
reminder for myself every week or every month to try and add new content to that as much as possible.

56
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:34,400
And I realized out of the 700 people, whatever, only 200 people, 220 or something people are

57
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:40,720
actually have access to the premium sales training library. So if you want, let me just

58
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:48,160
tell you this really quick. The premium sales training library is a compilation. It's not

59
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,600
done yet. It's ever evolving. It's ever being added to. It's something that I've started

60
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:59,520
creating and having a lot of fun with. This is 10 years of sales experience

61
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,480
in distilled into a training. Okay. And there's multiple videos. There's going to be more

62
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:10,000
content added to get access to the premium sales training library. You need to be paid in full your

63
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,520
tuition, the cost of entering this program. Some of you guys joined when we were still doing

64
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,800
internal payment programs or you guys use other funding sources. You need to be paid in full

65
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,800
with me. And if you are, you get access, you are granted access. You have the right to access

66
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,200
this premium sales training library, but it's shocking because less than a third of the people

67
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:36,320
in this program have access to the premium sales training library. And I know that there's

68
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,920
way more, probably double or double and a half that have paid in full. So if you guys have paid in full

69
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:50,160
message Aaron or fix it Felix and get access to the premium sales training library. If you have

70
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,960
not, and you would like access to it, go and get paid. What I was going to let you guys know is

71
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:02,640
right now it's December 3rd. There's 28 days left in the month. And anything like if you were to go

72
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:08,160
and you had like a thousand bucks left, anything that you do spend on this, because you're going

73
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,920
to spend it anyway, you can actually write it off as a tax write off. I don't know if you guys

74
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,280
understand this, but you can write it off as a tax write off. They can give you a break on your

75
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,640
taxes. So if you guys are people that are on like a payment plan, just get it paid off and write it

76
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:24,000
off on your taxes and get access to the premium sales training library, quit kicking the can down

77
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,720
the road. Okay. So that is going to be continually added onto that is 10 over 10 years. It's 11 years

78
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:36,720
of knowledge right here in my brain that I'm trying to put into a mini course that's ever evolving,

79
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,760
ever changing, ever being added onto. And as part of this program, as long as you are paid in full,

80
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:46,320
that is the premium sales training library. So if you do not have access and you are paid in full,

81
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,920
then reach out to Aaron. And if you are not paid in full, get freaking paid in full,

82
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:55,760
get access to everything and go and check it out. Secondly, for those of you that have not

83
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:01,440
started playing around with the rank and rent engine tools, no problem. You don't have to use

84
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:07,280
it. It's, it's not required. It's not something that you have to have. I will tell you that based

85
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,520
on, I know Ryan came on last week. I was traveling coming back from Dubai. And so thank you, Ryan,

86
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:18,560
for doing that. But we are so cool because we get to control this tool. We like literally as we,

87
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,880
my team goes through it, Francesca will go through the tool and she's like, Hey, I think

88
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:28,160
that this little button needs to be put over here to make it easier to drop down the menu and do

89
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:33,840
this. And I'm like, awesome, put it in a document, put it in a loom, send it to Ryan. And every single

90
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,960
week, every single five days we're sending a loom to Ryan. He's like noted and he goes in,

91
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:44,960
he talks to the developer and we're changing it. So we get to literally build this tool as we go

92
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,480
and we get to add into it. One of the things that I really, really wanted to see, and I talked to

93
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:52,880
Ryan about is like, dude, we got to make sure that there's a better, more in-depth way to look at

94
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:58,480
backlinks, right? And of course we wanted to come out with version 1.0 as soon as possible, as long

95
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:03,520
as the product was good enough. And we did. And I said, and we're going to have, you know, our tool

96
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:08,080
right now, it'll tell you how many backlinks, it'll tell you domain authority, a few different

97
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,480
things, but it doesn't really give you the backlink profile in depth. We need something that's at

98
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:19,520
least of the caliber of mangled. So talk to Ryan, he talked to the developers and we are right now

99
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:27,360
adding a backlink feature that's going to be as good as mangles right inside of the tool, the same

100
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,440
tool that's going to be your CRM, the same tool that's going to be your due diligence, the same

101
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,360
tool that's going to do everything. And I'm super, super excited about it. So that said guys,

102
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:43,840
guys, if you haven't already, if you haven't heard this, RankinRanEngine is going to be our go-to tool,

103
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:48,160
version 3.0. All of our training is going to have RankinRanEngine. We're going to be using

104
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:53,840
RankinRanEngine to do the search, the search volume. We're going to be doing RankinRanEngine

105
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,760
to do the, you know, check out our competitors, look at their backlink profiles. And if you have

106
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:07,520
not already, check that out. Now there is a code. Ryan sent it to me yesterday and I don't know

107
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:16,960
where it's at. Let's see here. Okay, here's the code for those of you. Also, by the way, for those

108
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:20,640
of you that are not in the U.S., that is our next thing that we're looking at is how do we get this

109
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:27,520
into as many countries outside of the U.S. as possible. So just so you have an idea, we are

110
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:32,240
working on that now. So I'm going to drop the code really quick and then let's get into this call.

111
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,200
And I don't know where it's at. Here's the code. Well, actually, you know what? You guys message me.

112
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,760
If you guys are interested in RankinRanEngine, message me. I'll send you the code and that's

113
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,160
going to give you a little discount for the first couple months to check out that tool. But anyway,

114
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,560
I'm having so much fun with that tool. I'm doing everything inside of it. I'm not, we got rid of

115
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:58,240
SEMrush. We got rid of Mangools. We got rid of every single thing. Ahrefs, whatever. We have a

116
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,040
suite of tools. We're paying 300 bucks a month, something like that, just for like basic tools.

117
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:09,120
And now everything's in one little place. Okay. So that said, guys, that's all I wanted to cover.

118
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:17,440
We got Richard Martez on. We got Ritu on. We've got Shane Noble. We've got, let's see, Eric already

119
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,160
said hi to Eric. Kirk, no, AiraRare is not available in the UK yet, but we are coming.

120
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:28,720
We are coming. Let me let Zach in really quick. And as I do that, let's see one second. Freaking

121
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:44,320
cold in here today. Zach Powell. What's up, Nick? How's it going, man? It's going great, bro. I'm

122
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,680
freezing. I'm going to turn up my heat a little bit while you give yourself a little intro. Give

123
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:54,320
me about 10 seconds, dude. I'm dying. Hold on. Sounds great. Yeah. I'm excited to be on today.

124
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:06,080
He said quick intro. I joined Digital Landlords two years ago and now I just love helping people

125
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:13,840
grow their businesses. So that's what I'm about. Today I'm going to talk about leverage,

126
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:19,760
which I'm stoked on. I've created a ton of leverage through hiring and building a team.

127
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:24,800
So great topic for today. I'm stoked. Yeah, bro. Appreciate you being on.

128
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,920
Always a treat to have Zach Powell on. Zach, what's your latest revenue, Mark? I know last

129
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:41,120
time we talked, it was just over 50,000. Yeah, we're at like 57,000. But there's other,

130
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:48,720
there's like a ads kind of arm we're adding on to. And so, yeah, it's maybe all together 65 or so.

131
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:58,320
Amazing. Okay. 65,000. Not bad for somebody who was making just around $6,000 two years ago at a

132
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:06,560
job. Yeah. Big difference. Yeah, that's crazy, bro. Big difference. How's the new house, dude?

133
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:12,160
You still enjoying it? Yeah, we call it the office because it's like a house that we work

134
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,320
out of like some team members in the US. We all just come to this house on an acre and

135
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:23,760
it's like catching the back and then work out of the house. It's fun. That's cool. What was I going

136
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:30,480
to ask you? Let's see. Oh, did you end up getting rid of the office office since you moved into the

137
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:38,560
house? Yeah, we were just renting that. So now we own this like acre kind of house office setup.

138
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:44,560
That's cool. Pretty, pretty fun. I remember when I first moved to St. George here, I was living in

139
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:49,280
Cedar City and it was cold and I came down, we're looking at houses and there was this guy, we went

140
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:55,200
and looked at this house and we went through the garage and he had like all these cars out front.

141
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:00,560
We went through the garage and he literally had like cubicles set up in his garage and he had like

142
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:07,040
his entire, he's like an engineer architect. He had like a 10-man team in his garage with fans

143
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,720
and the whole thing. Dude, I thought it was the coolest thing ever. I was like, bro, this guy,

144
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,360
this cat's like literally working out of his house. This is foreign, by the way. This isn't now,

145
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,520
like everyone works out the house now, but back in the day when you've knew somebody that worked

146
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:27,040
from home, it was like, you know, it was really cool. It was like unattainable. So it's exciting.

147
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:32,240
But yeah, dude, that's what's possible. I was on yesterday before we get into it and I was like,

148
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:39,120
I just jumped on really quick. I was looking at my goals and it reminded me like, dude, your whole

149
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,840
life, and this is a reminder for anyone on this call, that your entire life can change in a year.

150
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:50,880
Like you put your head down and you focus on one thing and you grow it and your entire life can

151
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:56,080
change in a year. You can go from barely making it, you know, budgeting what vacations are going on

152
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:03,280
to being able to buy properties, you know, buy your wife whatever car they want, get into a new

153
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:09,120
house and like your whole identity changes. So it's exciting because we have the tools

154
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:15,440
in front of us to do that. It's just up to us now. So one of the things that is part of this

155
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:22,160
business that I wish I had done way sooner was create leverage because I was Mr. like,

156
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:28,800
you know, solopreneur, do it myself, figure everything out on my own because I could beat

157
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:34,400
my chest, whatever. And then I realized that the real players, the people that are actually scaling,

158
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,760
they are using other people because there's different types of leverage. Zach's going to

159
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:44,640
talk about this today, but one of those pieces of leverage is human capital and using other people.

160
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:48,880
And so everyone, not everyone, but I get some messages sometimes like, when do you recommend

161
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:53,440
hiring? Okay. And that's one of the things I'm going to ask Zach, his opinion on this. My opinion

162
00:14:53,440 --> 00:15:01,040
is as soon as possible. Okay. So anyway, that said, Zach, I'm going to give you a co-host. That way

163
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,440
you can share anything you want, but we're going to be talking about hiring, creating leverage.

164
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,400
And that is something Zach has done very, very well. It's allowed him to go. Where was it? You

165
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:17,280
were just on a surfing trip. Was that in Hawaii? No coaster. I was in Hawaii, Hawaii for a month

166
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:23,840
and then Nicaragua for a week. And then actually this last weekend, they opened a manmade wave,

167
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:29,040
like 10 minutes from my house in Arizona. And so I was surfing that on like their VIP opening day.

168
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:34,080
And it was awesome surfing in the desert in Arizona. So that's surfing across the globe,

169
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:38,400
man. It's, it's been fun. That's amazing, bro. I love that. And that's, that's,

170
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:42,320
that's the beauty of the business. All right, bro. You got, you got hosts. Let's, let's get into it,

171
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,080
man. You, I'm going to, rather than me direct this, I'm going to have you direct it because

172
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:53,600
you're the expert and I'll just kind of chip in where I see fit. Sounds great, man. So yeah,

173
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:59,840
talking about hiring, I think first it's a mindset thing we got to get over. Like you mentioned,

174
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:04,720
so I'm going to get into that. I'll share my screen, how I think about hiring and then also

175
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:11,200
share like how I actually do hiring and kind of my playbook for that. So let me share my screen

176
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,720
and I'll walk you through how I think about it.

177
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:33,280
All right. We good. You guys see this? I can see a white, yeah, a whiteboard.

178
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:40,720
Whiteboard. Okay. Here we go. If you guys have like journals or notes, like you're going to want to

179
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,120
write this down. It's pretty awesome stuff. That's opened my mind a lot. So the first one,

180
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:50,560
there's three things I'll show you real quick. And then I'll stop sharing, but the first one

181
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:58,000
to talk about real quick, it's called your buyback rate. And this will open your mind a lot. Buyback

182
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:05,200
rate. What is buyback rate and how do you calculate it? So essentially the reason we want our buyback

183
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:13,920
rate is you want to grow a company that you don't grow to hate. You want to grow a company that you

184
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:19,840
enjoy running. And so you don't want to hire, to actually grow your business. You want to hire,

185
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:26,800
to buy back your time. And I'll explain what this means, but the first step is calculating your

186
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:34,320
buyback rate. So buyback rate, the first thing is your income. This is like, if you have a job right

187
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:40,320
now, that income counts and the income from your business and all the write-offs that are like

188
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:48,000
for you. Basically all the money you have, like you guys know what I'm talking about when

189
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:52,640
you're buying things, you would have bought in any way, but you buy through your business.

190
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,600
All of the income, all of the financial gain you receive from your job, from your business,

191
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:08,480
from everything goes into your buyback rate. So income divided by 2000 hours. Why 2000 hours?

192
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:14,320
2000 hours because there's about 50 working weeks in the year, 40 hours in a week. That equals 2000

193
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:21,920
working hours in an average year. So divide your income by 2000 hours. That gives you what

194
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:30,240
your time is worth per hour, dollars an hour. One of the biggest issues with hiring is people don't

195
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:36,320
think their time is actually worth what it's worth. And so they're doing $5 tasks when their

196
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:41,680
time is worth $100 an hour. And it just absolutely makes no sense. And so this will help it kind of

197
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:48,800
become clear for you guys. So let's just use an example. Let's say your income with your W-2,

198
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:55,600
your job, your company, like everything, whatever. Let's say it's 100,000. 100k divided by 2000 hours

199
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:04,400
that equals $50 an hour. We'll just use that an example. So your time is worth $50 an hour.

200
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:12,400
And so are you valuing your time at that rate? So that's the first piece. Then you take what

201
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:17,040
your time is worth per hour. And guys, figure this out right now. Look at the past 12 months.

202
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:22,480
Calculate what your income has been the past 12 months. Divide that by 2000 hours. Get your

203
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:28,800
buyback rate right now. Once you have what your time is worth per hour, then you take that $50 an

204
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:42,400
hour divided by four. That would be $12.50. Why divide by four? Because $12.50 is what you can hire

205
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:49,600
somebody for and get a four times return on your investment. So if you hire someone for $12.50 an

206
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:56,480
hour or less, you automatically have a four times return on your investment if they take things off

207
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:05,680
your plate, if they do things that you would have done. And that's the key. So in this example,

208
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:16,000
let's say this person makes $100,000 a year, their buyback rate is $12.50 an hour. And so like

209
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:25,120
when I first did this, it kind of blew my mind. A couple years ago, I calculated this and I was

210
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:32,000
like, Whoa, my buyback rate is over $30 an hour. And then I looked at what I was doing each day.

211
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:38,800
And I was like, why am I doing $5 an hour tasks when my time is worth over $30 an hour?

212
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:46,160
It doesn't make sense. So sometimes we got to see. Go ahead. So anything, just to clarify,

213
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:54,960
so anything that is, just explain again, the $12.50. So anything that's less than that,

214
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,760
you should be hiring out. Explain that piece. Once you calculate your buyback rate,

215
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:05,200
what does that mean? And what should we do with that information? Because I saw a few

216
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:14,160
people that just jumped on. Awesome question. So basically, anything you do that you can pay

217
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:21,440
someone $12.50 or less to do, pay them to do that. Get that off your plate, buy back your time.

218
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,800
And this will go into the next piece here. That's an awesome question. The next piece

219
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:31,520
is the time and energy audit. So this is step one. Step two is the time and energy audit. And then

220
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:37,520
we'll go to step three. So step two answers that question in depth really well. So I'll just hop

221
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:45,600
right into that. We'll do the next thing, time and energy audit. This one's pretty simple,

222
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:54,560
but profound as well. Time and energy audit. Okay. So hopefully you've calculated your buyback rate.

223
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:59,040
If you just hopped on, it's your income, everything, all the money that comes to you,

224
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:04,880
your job, your business, perks, everything, all that. What's the number? Your income per year

225
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:10,560
divided by 2000 hours, 2000 working hours in a year, gives you your hourly rate,

226
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:17,760
what you're worth per hour. Divide that then by four. And that is your buyback rate because

227
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:23,120
you're getting a four times return on your investment. If you hire someone for a fourth

228
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:27,360
of what you make per hour, you're automatically getting four times return on your investment,

229
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:34,640
which is awesome. So next question is like, how do I find the things to take off my plate?

230
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:40,720
Well, this makes it simple. You just do a time and energy audit. So you write down the task

231
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:47,600
that you're going to do and you write down the value. And what I do on my watch,

232
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,040
I'll pull up and I'll say, Hey, like, you know, start a 15 minute timer and I'll just refresh

233
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:58,560
it all day. And every 15 minutes I have my running list and I just write down what I did.

234
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:10,880
Right. So let's say, um, drive to office there that, and then I do a value,

235
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:17,440
just $1 sign to $4 signs, $4 signs. If it's super valuable, $1 sign. If it's low value

236
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:24,160
drive to office. Okay. We'll say that's $1 sign. And then, you know, I get to office

237
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:31,200
deck email, you know, not that valuable $1 sign. And then I do a sales call sales call.

238
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:37,840
That is like the most valuable thing I do. That is the most valuable thing. And then I train my team,

239
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:47,120
team training, and that's valuable. Maybe we'll say $3 signs. Right. So from here,

240
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:53,680
then what you do, the other piece of this is does it. So it's time and energy audit. You're

241
00:23:53,680 --> 00:24:00,480
auditing your time every 15 minutes. Is this thing valuable, not valuable? Um, and then the other

242
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:08,080
piece that really makes this, um, phenomenal is you audit your energy at the end of those 15 minutes.

243
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:13,760
Did that task light you up? Did he give you more energy or did it drain your energy? Do you not

244
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:20,560
like doing that thing? So drive to the office. Um, you know, I'm going to do email, email, boom.

245
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:26,080
I'm going to highlight that red, that drains my energy sales call. That actually gives me energy

246
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:32,000
because I love talking to people, team training. That gives me energy driving to the office. Um,

247
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,040
that drains energy unless I'm going to say, okay, tomorrow when I drive to the office,

248
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:42,400
I'm going to actually drive to the office and use my car as my university. I'm going to like be

249
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:47,200
listening to the digital landlords trainings. I'm going to be like learning while I'm driving,

250
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:54,720
drive to office. We'll do and learn. Boom. Now this value just went up and I enjoy it now. Okay.

251
00:24:54,720 --> 00:25:00,160
So, um, this is the time and energy audit.

252
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:09,440
You audit your time and your energy. And what happens is you do this for a week and then you

253
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:14,640
start noticing all the things that are red and drain your energy and that are $1 signs.

254
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:20,160
And all of those things are the things that you see. How the heck can I stop doing that

255
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:27,040
and pay someone my buyback rate or less to do that for me? And now you have the exact

256
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:34,560
things you want to hire for. Um, for example, my first hire that I ever hired was a content writer.

257
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:42,480
Why? Because that drained my energy and I could hire someone, $4 an hour, $5 an hour to do that

258
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:50,320
for me. And I'm like, why am I spending 10 hours a week writing content? It makes no sense. Right.

259
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:56,320
Why next thing was building websites. Why am I building websites? So does that make sense?

260
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:01,600
Everybody, any questions so far? I guess in the chat, like put any takeaways, like what do you,

261
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,360
it's not what's taught, it's what's caught. So like, what do you guys catch in? Like what,

262
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:10,800
what so far is your biggest takeaway in the chat? Like teach each other, share that.

263
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:16,880
That when, uh, when you're doing the energy and time audit, do you, you write down,

264
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:21,360
I've done this before, but I haven't really done it as specific as you, which is like

265
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:28,480
drive to the office, like every single thing. Um, how do you, when it's stuff like that, do you like,

266
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,760
okay, let's say that you hate driving to the office. You hate, uh, you know, going and getting

267
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:38,080
lunch because both those things kind of like suck your energy and they're not really, I mean,

268
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:42,880
they're not providing money. They're just taking money. How do you get like, have you considered

269
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:47,600
hiring somebody or different solutions for that? Like, let's say driving to the office, what do you

270
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:52,000
do in that situation? You're like, okay, maybe I can't hire somebody, but I can start working from

271
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,480
home. Or you start thinking outside the box like that. Like what are some solutions to it instead

272
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:03,120
of just hiring or I'm talking about the things maybe outside of the business tasks, but that

273
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,120
you still have to do that are draining your energy.

274
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:14,240
That's an awesome question. Um, I think the first step is being aware, right? Like the first thing

275
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,400
that I would say you want to be problem aware. So the time and energy audit makes you problem

276
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:23,920
aware. And when you're aware and you write it down, then your brain starts working on it. And

277
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:30,480
you're like, how could I use my time more effectively? People that make millions and

278
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,720
millions of dollars a year, use their time much more effectively than people that make

279
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:41,120
$50,000 a year, right? So if we can look at how we're spending our time, this is actually super

280
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:47,280
eye opening. Like the first time I did this, the way I spent my time, the way I thought I spent my

281
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:52,560
time wasn't actually how I spent my time. So like, I challenge you guys to actually do this and

282
00:27:52,560 --> 00:28:00,400
you'll realize like, whoa, I spend way more time than I thought, um, doing content writing or

283
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:06,480
building websites or these things that if it's on a computer, you can hire someone around the

284
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:13,040
world to do it. Um, and this will open your eyes. One thought on that with it's, it's not necessarily

285
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:19,600
hiring a VA from, from online jobs, but if you guys are like sitting at your house and you're

286
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:24,160
like, well, it's time for me to get lunch and you're driving to go get food because you want

287
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:31,040
to save $5 from a door dash fees. You guys are being very, very short-sighted because you can

288
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:37,520
literally spend, I can order Chipotle. You could count to 12. I can order it in like 12 seconds

289
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:42,480
and it would show up at my door and I saved like 45 minutes a day. And yes, instead of my Chipotle

290
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:49,440
bowl being $8, it's like 18 with delivery fee in the tip, but like the cost me 10 bucks. I just

291
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:55,360
bought 45 minutes of my time for $10 and it doesn't take me off task. I don't get stuck in

292
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:00,720
traffic. I don't get caught by my buddy. That's like, Hey bro, let me pick your brain, you know,

293
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,440
and you're not have to be rude. And then you get distracted. So it's the same concept, even though

294
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:10,160
you're not necessarily hiring a VA in the Philippines, you're hiring a door dash person

295
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:15,920
and it's costing you 10 extra dollars every day, but that saves you so much time. So just a thought.

296
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:21,200
That's awesome because it's not just employees, right? It's how it's like, you want to design

297
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:28,560
your life and to be aware first, you need to know how much your time is worth and then you need to

298
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:33,840
know how you're using your time. Time is the most precious resource, right? Like how are you using

299
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:44,560
it? So when you're thinking about that, like the reason I want to show you guys this is the way

300
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:52,720
is the way you spend your time isn't how you think you spend your time. Generally, we think

301
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:59,120
that we are much more effective than we actually are. So this is massively eye opening. So I

302
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:04,960
challenge you guys to do this. Okay. The third piece that'll kind of bring this all together,

303
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:10,800
it's called the buyback loop and it looks like this. Here we go.

304
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,680
It looks like this.

305
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:23,280
An arrow right there. So what happens, there's three steps. You audit your time with the time

306
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:32,000
and energy audit. You transfer the low value and energy draining things,

307
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:41,280
transfer to another person, to AI, like Nick's thing, DoorDash, like you transfer those things

308
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:49,440
to buy back your time, to get your energy where you want it. And then you fill, you fill your time

309
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:54,560
with more things that light you up that are green and are four dollar signs more valuable.

310
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:02,720
And it's a continuous cycle. You audit, transfer, fill, audit, transfer, fill, and you just spiral

311
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:08,480
upwards. And the momentum comes from the fill. Like you have to fill your time with things that

312
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:15,280
are more valuable than you used to do. And that's why it's so powerful. So this, this kind of

313
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:22,080
connects it all. And what happens is right here, this is called the pain line right here. And what

314
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:34,240
happens, people, you won't grow into pain if it is uncomfortable or, you know, you're not going to

315
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,760
make more sales calls. You're not going to grind harder if you know that that's just going to add

316
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:46,480
a ton of stress to your life. But what if you know that growing, adding monthly recurring revenue

317
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:52,720
to your business doesn't make you have to work more and more and more, but you have like the

318
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:59,840
ability to transfer and fill and you're making more money doing things, doing more of the things

319
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:06,080
that you like doing. So that kind of connects it all here. You have your buyback rate, you know

320
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,800
what your time is worth, and then you look at how you're spending your time and the energy it gives

321
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:16,080
you. One thing I haven't said yet either is over time doing these time and energy audits,

322
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:20,960
you'll realize, oh, I have more energy in the morning or I have more energy at night and then

323
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:27,520
structure your day accordingly. You know, if you have high value tasks that light you up,

324
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:36,000
do those when you have a lot of energy and like, you know, use your, your being tuned with your

325
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,800
body and like, no, okay, here's my energy. And then you'll be able to produce better work and

326
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:47,200
organize your day accordingly. So doing that, and then using this, it's called the buyback loop,

327
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:53,360
using the buyback loop to audit your time, transfer these low value, energy draining things

328
00:32:54,080 --> 00:33:00,080
to other people. And then the key, the ticket, and people always get this wrong, is they fill

329
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:08,640
their time with social media, or they fill their time with like, stupid stuff that doesn't push

330
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:15,440
the needle forward. They fill their time, you know, like, time will expand, and you'll just

331
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:21,120
take like three hours to do something that you could do in 15 minutes. So the key is fill your

332
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:28,880
time with these things that are high value that you like doing. And then you build a life that you

333
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:35,600
you never want to retire from you build a life that you love. So yeah, is that making sense

334
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:40,480
for everybody or any any questions? Throw them in the chat. There's a couple questions I want to

335
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,840
mention, I want to give you this fun, this really extreme example. So I have a buddy.

336
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:51,360
He is a real estate agent. And he's been for as long as I've known him since about 2018,

337
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:56,000
this guy makes like, he makes over seven figures in commissions as a real estate agent, which is

338
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,280
very, very impressive, right? It's very difficult to find anyone that can make a seven figures

339
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:05,280
outside of owning their own business. And yeah, technically, you own your own business is real

340
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:10,240
estate. This guy's in St. George, Utah. He's not in Hollywood. He's he's makes he's mixed seven

341
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:15,600
figures doing real estate. This guy's a machine, dude. He's on the phone, I think like four hours

342
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:20,560
a day just cold calling. And I remember we used to do this meet, we'd meet like once a week have

343
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:27,360
lunch, like a group of us. And he was like, Yeah, I'm thinking about like, how do I can save time

344
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:32,880
and how I can because he makes money when he's on the phone, like that's it. And so what he did is

345
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:39,680
he bought a Sprinter van, he wrapped it with his logo to you know, whatever. And then he set up an

346
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:44,800
office inside the Sprinter van so that when he's on his way to showings, he can be dialing while

347
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:51,120
he's on his way to showings. And I was like, dude, that's so gangster. That is so next level that

348
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:56,000
he's even worried about the 15 minutes in between showing so he can be on his computer and making

349
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,680
those extra five phone calls, which I thought was pretty dang sweet. And sure enough, about a year

350
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:07,840
and a half later, I noticed his Sprinter van around town like he actually did it. He actually

351
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:11,120
freaking did it. So that's the kind of an extreme example. But one more thing I want to add.

352
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:18,240
It's kind of like, what Zach saying is super important about filling the time because it's

353
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:22,000
like, I don't remember, dude, I think maybe probably one of your missionaries, when we used

354
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,840
to teach people like, hey, if you're going to remove this bad habit, you have to fill it with

355
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:30,000
something else. Otherwise, it's like a hole, and the hole is going to be filled. So you got to

356
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,480
fill it with something good, or it's going to get filled with something not as good. So make sure

357
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:40,160
that you're not just leaving these empty gaps. We all know those people that go to the gym for

358
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:44,560
three hours, and you can get the gym done in 45 minutes to an hour. You don't need to be there

359
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:48,240
three hours. I don't care who you are. You don't need to be there three hours. An hour is plenty.

360
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:53,600
So I think that's super, super valuable. One thing I want to ask, Zach, how often do you recommend,

361
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:59,840
or do you personally do time and energy audits? Is it quarterly, monthly,

362
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:03,360
once a year? What's your go-to? And then we'll get into some of the questions everyone has.

363
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:11,120
Yeah, awesome question. I would say quarterly, once you've kind of gotten a good routine,

364
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:18,160
when you start this out, do like, start now and do it for two weeks, and then adjust. You're going

365
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:22,320
to make a lot of quick adjustments, and then do another one a couple weeks later, and a couple

366
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:28,080
weeks later until you feel like you have a good flow. Once you have a good flow of how you're

367
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:33,840
spending your time each day, and your routine, and it's dialed in, then you can go to quarterly.

368
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:40,000
But if you ever, the general thing is whenever you feel like, oh man, you know when you have

369
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:46,320
that feeling bogged down, or you're not stoked on what you're doing, do another time and energy

370
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,480
audit, and figure out why. Figure out why you're not completely stoked on your life.

371
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:56,320
Because you should be. You're a business owner. If you're doing it right, if you're owning your

372
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:01,360
business in the right way, we should be like the happiest people on earth, because we own our time.

373
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:08,160
We can work from anywhere. It's awesome. We can use the money the company generates to live the

374
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:12,880
best life we want to live, and keep making more money at the same time, if we do it right. So

375
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:17,920
that's kind of my thoughts on that. So you would recommend everyone

376
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,000
two weeks, go do a two week energy. Are you doing this on weekends too?

377
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:30,480
Oh yeah, yep. And I actually have like, I made it into a Google Sheet, so if anybody wants that,

378
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:36,160
just like direct message me, time and energy audit, and then I'll send you a link. You can

379
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:41,040
make a copy of mine, and you know, do it in the Google Sheet. But honestly, it's as simple as

380
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:47,200
this. You can just do it in a notepad, and just write it. Super cool, super easy. But

381
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:52,880
let me stop to share here too. You're good. I'm going to write direct message Zach Powell,

382
00:37:52,880 --> 00:38:00,880
time energy audit to get his Google Sheet. And yeah, the other thing though is, I guess that's

383
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:07,120
just all of that is for the mindset, right? People have issues hiring because they're like,

384
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:12,240
I can do it, I can do it. It's just human nature. Like you were saying, we all do it, we all hold

385
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:17,520
on to things too long. But when we look at the numbers, we look at our buyback rate. Oh, shoot,

386
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:25,440
my time is worth $100 an hour. Now I can hire someone $25 an hour or less, man, I can do,

387
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:30,640
I can hire someone at that rate to do almost everything I do, right? And you upgrade your

388
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:35,680
life. And now you're doing way more effective stuff. So doing those three things and helping

389
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:41,040
those all come together in your mind will give you the confidence and realize it's actually dumb

390
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:46,160
for me to not hire. And that's what it usually takes for people to get to the point where they

391
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:52,640
start hiring. And then the issue becomes people are terrible at hiring. And I know we're running

392
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:59,520
short on time. But the next thing is like, how do you hire? And so I have like a full hiring

393
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:06,560
playbook of how I get a ton of applicants and dwindle them down automatically without taking

394
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:13,360
a lot of time to find awesome people to add to my team. So if anybody wants like my hiring

395
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:18,000
playbook, what I do, just direct message me like the word hiring, and I'll shoot you the link,

396
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,200
I have like a Google Doc of my process. So maybe I'll put that in the chat. But

397
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:30,880
I'll put it real quick. I'll put Zach for the hiring playbook. And he put this together guys,

398
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:36,400
for time's sake. And also because he's he's done this a lot. DM Zach Powell for hiring playbook.

399
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,760
Okay. All right. So you don't mind getting blown up?

400
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:45,040
Yeah. Yeah, it's fine. Everyone can just DM me like I love helping you guys we can

401
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:52,080
chat whatever. But the biggest thing is like with hiring, most people don't get enough applicants.

402
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:56,560
That's the number one issue. They don't have a big enough pool of people applying for their jobs.

403
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:00,960
So then they end up with like a couple applicants and they just pick one and hire someone not good.

404
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:05,680
So you want a lot of applicants. This is what the hiring playbook shows and shows my process for

405
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:11,200
getting a ton of applicants and then automatically dwindling those down to the best ones. So it

406
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:17,040
doesn't take a ton of your time, but you effectively get all the best ones in a group. That's the other

407
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:21,680
thing people do wrong is like they waste too much time trying to hire. And then it's a pain. And

408
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:27,360
that's why they don't upgrade and, you know, hire and transfer and fill very well is like it takes

409
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:33,360
so much time. So my playbook like makes it easy to automatically dwindle it down. And then the third

410
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:39,680
thing is like they end up with subpar employees because their hiring funnel is so thin, right? So

411
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:45,440
thick hiring funnel. Now you have the cream of the crop, way better people. When I first started

412
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:51,120
hiring, I made a lot of bad hires. Now almost every single hire is phenomenal because they align

413
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:56,000
so well. Like I have this huge pool and they align so well. And I just add phenomenal people to my

414
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:01,680
team time after time after time. So you want my playbook for how I do that? Just message me hiring.

415
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:07,280
I'll send it to you. Message me if you want the time and energy audit. These have been like

416
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:13,760
huge things for me to take it to the next level. And like not just financially because at one point

417
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:19,120
I was making a lot of money, but kind of hating life. Then I started making more money and loving

418
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:25,440
life more because of these things. So if you want to build a business that you never want to retire

419
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:32,800
from, that's how you do it, which is fun to think about. A couple of questions that were a little

420
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:37,760
more specific. Luke Hill has a question. How do you trust VAs with things like cPanel to build

421
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:44,880
out the site? Because it sounds like he's using WordPress. I know that like on Weebly and stuff,

422
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:50,240
you can give limited access. And I know you use Duda, but how do you deal? Let's just make it a

423
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:55,520
more general question. How do you hire or trust VAs and stuff with a little more sensitive

424
00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:00,800
information? I think most tools will allow you to give limited access. I don't use WordPress,

425
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:06,400
but I've used it a teeny amount to know that you're talking about WordPress. Any thoughts on that?

426
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:16,640
Yeah, awesome question. Just as with anything, you build trust over time. So when you hire someone

427
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:22,320
through the hiring process, you've gained trust. And now you have your onboarding, right? You

428
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:28,480
should have an onboarding sequence of video recordings of yourself doing things and training

429
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:34,720
them. Video recordings of you training your team, they go through these things. And as you work with

430
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:40,480
them, you build trust. They start trusting you as the owner, someone that's going to pay their

431
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:45,200
salary, someone to work for that you're going to invest in them, care about them, have a good

432
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:49,360
company to work at, they're going to build trust in you. And you're going to build trust in them.

433
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:52,960
You're going to see how quickly they respond in Slack. You're going to see how quickly they do

434
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:59,760
things. You're going to see the quality of their work very quickly. And so like Nick's saying,

435
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:06,320
you can give them the all back access. And then over time, as you build trust, you give them more.

436
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:12,080
You know, now I have an assistant I've worked with for over two years. I just give her my

437
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:17,200
passwords to everything. We have like 100% trust. Yeah, yeah, she could rob me and steal

438
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:22,240
a couple thousand bucks. But it's like, yeah, she lost her job. Would you steal from your boss

439
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:26,960
thousands of dollars? No, probably not. Because you would lose your job. Are they going to steal

440
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:30,800
hundreds of dollars from me? No, because then they're going to lose their job. Like, it's just,

441
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:35,840
that's like another mental barrier that people have is like, I can't give this because I don't

442
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:41,280
trust the person will give them things that they can't mess up. Or like if they mess up,

443
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:51,120
it's low. It's like low, what do you call it? Low? Yeah, yeah, it's it's it's low. Yeah, low,

444
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:57,760
low risk, basically. Yeah, low risk. That's the risk. That's the low risk. That's what you want.

445
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,320
And then just build and give them more and more and more. So one thing, awesome question. It's

446
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:07,600
another mindset thing. One thing too, from our training, we've had Joe Jonas, the founder of

447
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:15,680
onlinejobs.ph on like twice. And I remember that he said, like he has employed his VA's have access

448
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:21,040
to literally everything, including his bank, including his credit cards. But what's so

449
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:26,800
interesting is that in the Philippines, this is such a cultural thing. There you're people that

450
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:31,200
mean, yes, there's going to be some bad people, but people that are on that site, for the most part,

451
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:39,360
like it's culturally unacceptable to basically ruin your boss or go backstab or not be loyal.

452
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:43,200
Like loyalty is a big thing in the Philippines. One of the reasons it makes such a good place

453
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:49,200
for VA. So I've personally never had any bad experiences in terms of like, I've never even

454
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:57,040
had a VA from the Philippines try and do content that's been plagiarized, which is still a bad

455
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:04,000
thing, but it's low on the totem pole of like offensive, illegal activity. I've never even

456
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,720
caught anyone doing, you know, plagiarized content. So I don't think it's something you

457
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:14,080
should super have to worry about. And I also remember in, I remember in a four hour workweek,

458
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:18,880
Tim Ferriss talking about when he was building a supplement company, when he used to give his VA's

459
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:23,040
like, basically they would be able to make decisions at anything below a hundred dollars.

460
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:27,680
So you have to, at some point guys, you have to relinquish control. If you think you're going to

461
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:33,200
control every aspect of your business forever, then you're not going to grow. It's the exact

462
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:40,160
saying. It's a mindset thing. And it's a limiting belief because you, you know, and this is one of

463
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:48,080
the things I heard really quick is we give ourselves as business owners, as entrepreneurs,

464
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:53,040
you know, we give ourselves slack when we fail because like, well, we learned a lesson,

465
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:57,520
but we don't give our employees that same slack. Sometimes we expect them to be a hundred percent

466
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,880
perfect. And like they're humans, they're going to mess up. They're going to forget to do this and

467
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:04,480
that. You have to expect that it's not going to be perfect. They're not going to do, they're not

468
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:08,720
going to, you can't expect them to carry a hundred percent as much as you because they don't own a

469
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:12,640
hundred percent of your business. But that's not the goal. You want to get somebody that can do it

470
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:18,160
80% or better as good as you. And then you hire it out. That's, that's the game. That's the entire

471
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:24,080
game. So real quick, couple of questions. Jason Adams says, this is why I use Instacart grocery

472
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:28,640
shopping is low value energy sucking and time consuming. Jason, that's because you've never

473
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:33,280
been to a Harman's. Just kidding. But I do love, I do love, you know, it's funny thing about me,

474
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:38,240
and this is one thing we could know. If you have something that's on your list, it's like

475
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:42,960
low value, but it's high energy. Those are things that you could keep and just kind of

476
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:48,320
chalk up to like they're your hobbies. Like for me personally, depending on the grocery store,

477
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:52,960
I don't mind going in grocery store sometimes going into produce. Like it kind of, I kind of

478
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:58,160
like it. I'm kind of weird like that. But I also know like my dad, if you catch him in a grocery

479
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:05,280
store, dude, the earth ending tomorrow, like he's done. He's not doing it. Right. So yeah,

480
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:11,200
that's just that's your investment quadrant, things that light you up, but are low value.

481
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:15,680
You want to do those things that you're investing in those. It's not your production quadrant, but

482
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:20,480
you're investing in those things and delegation quadrant, low energy, low money, like get those

483
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:25,280
off your plate for sure. And dude, I have no problem doing those kinds of things after hours.

484
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:31,840
I'm not going to do that in the middle of the day, obviously. Nick Kudlick from St. George says,

485
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:36,640
amazing read, how to buy back your time by Dan Martell. Yes. Phenomenal book. I know you

486
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:45,280
really like that book, Zach. A lot of these concepts are from that. Jason said he had a

487
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:49,040
seven figures in recurring revenue as a corporate employee in the investment industry. Then he quit

488
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:54,240
and started over. Yes. I remember that dude. And good on you, dude. Life's too short. He also said,

489
00:47:54,240 --> 00:48:00,880
Dr. J weightlifting is a waste of time is a book. And he said, dude is jacked over 50 years, 50 years

490
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:06,880
old too. So check that out. Um, Luke says Kroger has saved so much of my time with delivery. There's

491
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:12,000
no fee for delivery. It makes no sense to drive. Beautiful. I agree. A hundred percent. So takeaways,

492
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:19,200
if you want to get the plate, the, the Google doc that Google sheet that Zach's put together,

493
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:23,040
DM Zach, if you want to get the playbook, the hiring playbook that Zach's put together,

494
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:28,800
DM Zach, go blow up Zach's DM. Uh, Zach's one of the only people that doesn't mind. You can go

495
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:33,520
blow him up. He's, he's obviously he's got limited time, but he's kind enough. You guys message him.

496
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:38,640
He'll send you those things and walk you through it. Um, any last thoughts you want to end with

497
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:45,600
before we, we end this, uh, stream Zach. Yeah. One last thought is it doesn't really click for

498
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:51,760
people. Sometimes this helps it click is you look at Amazon, Google, Microsoft,

499
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:57,280
the difference between those companies and your company is they have thousands of people,

500
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:02,560
tens of thousands of people pushing their company forward every day. That's why they're making so

501
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:08,640
much money. They have thousands of sales reps, thousands of programmers, thousands of people

502
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:12,080
pushing them forward, pushing forward. Of course they're going to win and make tons and tons of

503
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:20,160
money. If you only have you pushing you forward, you're just living in the slow lane. Why not hire

504
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:27,120
someone? And there's people can actually do specific things of your business way better than

505
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:31,600
you. You think you're going to be a better website builder. You think you're going to be better at

506
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:36,720
SEO. You think you're going to be better at sales. Even you're not, there's people better at that

507
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:43,440
thing than you. You just got to find them and set them loose. And now you're going twice as fast,

508
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:48,000
three times as fast. You have all these people, you become more like Amazon. So that's what needs

509
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:55,360
to click. Why is Amazon, Google, Facebook, why are they such big companies? Tens, even hundreds

510
00:49:55,360 --> 00:50:00,080
of thousands of people are pushing them forward. Is it just you pushing you forward? Why don't you

511
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:06,960
enroll someone and push yourself forward way faster? And at the same time, not just do it

512
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:12,240
to make money and stretch yourself out, but build it right where now your life's awesome

513
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:16,320
and you're doing things that light you up and make you a ton of money day after day. And it's a

514
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:21,840
continuous upward spiral. That's the life that I want to live and I invite you guys to live too.

515
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:27,600
So if you want help with it, just let me know. Happy to chat about it. Beautiful. Zach Powell,

516
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:32,240
appreciate you, bro. Also, I know Zach does a bunch of stuff. Do you want to jump on?

517
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:33,760
What's your website? Let me just drop it in here.

518
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,760
ZachPowell.co.

519
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:42,800
Z-A-C-K-W-E-P-O-W-E-L-L.CO.

520
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:50,400
Yep. Yeah. I share like my Stripe page and like points of learning through my growth. It's like

521
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:54,960
a seven minute video and then another video about what I'm doing. But yeah, check it out.

522
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:58,720
Probably get some good insights. Zach Powell, thanks for jumping on, dude. I'm always a walk

523
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:04,160
away, edified, excited, pumped. And I appreciate you being on and everyone else I know is as well.

524
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:09,840
So we'll have you on again soon. And guys, message or DM Zach for those, the playbook,

525
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:12,720
the sheet, and then if you want to check out his website as well. But anyway, thanks, bro.

526
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,000
Thanks, Nick. That was fun, man.

527
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,160
Hey, talk soon, bro. See you.
