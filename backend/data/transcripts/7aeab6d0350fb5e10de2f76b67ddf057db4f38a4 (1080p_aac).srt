00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
OK, Ariel says, why do you not touch the ones that have CPC as NA?

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,920
So the reason why, real quick on that, Ariel,

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:12,200
is because typically with CPC, think about it, right?

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,200
Supply and demand.

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,120
So if the cost per click is zero, that

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,800
means there's nobody else bidding on it, right?

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,280
There's no marketers, there's no business owners,

8
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,040
there's no one else that's wanting to pay for those ads.

9
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:29,720
Which I can therefore infer that it's worth nothing, right?

10
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,520
So for example, you're going to have a keyword like cheap concrete

11
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,640
companies in Newport, whatever, right?

12
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,240
That CPC is zero.

13
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,200
Why?

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,560
Because no one cares about it.

15
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,200
So if you want to go like those CPCs, the reason why

16
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,440
is because it's typically a waste of time, right?

17
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,840
There's no volume.

18
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,680
It says there's volume, but it's not worth anything.

19
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,320
So if you want to go test it out, cool.

20
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,120
And there's probably a couple situations

21
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,800
where, yeah, it's going to work.

22
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:01,680
But I'm just using my intuition of saying, OK, there's CPC that's

23
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,480
zero, which means nobody cares enough to pay for it,

24
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:09,400
which means there's one of many things, right?

25
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,000
There's too much supply and not enough demand or vice versa.

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,360
So that's why.

27
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,400
Hope that makes sense.
