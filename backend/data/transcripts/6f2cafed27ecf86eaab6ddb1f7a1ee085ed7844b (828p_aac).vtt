00:00.000 --> 00:02.920
What would you say to a BO if they ask,

00:02.920 --> 00:05.840
can you teach me to build my own website?

00:05.840 --> 00:08.720
Or this one's probably one that people get more often

00:08.720 --> 00:12.320
is why do I need you when I can build my own website?

00:12.320 --> 00:13.600
Seems easy enough.

00:13.600 --> 00:15.200
And I guess my clarification,

00:15.200 --> 00:16.420
and I'm gonna make some assumptions here,

00:16.420 --> 00:18.040
but my clarification is like,

00:18.040 --> 00:21.080
are we building websites or are we generating leads?

00:21.080 --> 00:24.240
So I'm assuming that you're talking about generating leads.

00:24.240 --> 00:25.680
And if the business owner,

00:25.680 --> 00:27.720
if that's just wasn't clarified, then that's fine.

00:27.720 --> 00:28.800
But let's say the business owner said,

00:28.800 --> 00:30.560
why do I need you if I can just build my own website

00:30.560 --> 00:31.800
and get my own leads?

00:31.800 --> 00:35.560
Then my question or my response to that would be like,

00:35.560 --> 00:37.680
if you honestly, sir, if you can do that,

00:37.680 --> 00:41.360
then you should go do that by all means, by all means.

00:41.360 --> 00:44.680
But like, why haven't you done that yet?

00:44.680 --> 00:45.520
Right?

00:45.520 --> 00:46.920
Like that makes zero sense.

00:46.920 --> 00:51.920
Like, and so I don't think I've ever got the second one.

00:52.920 --> 00:55.520
Why would like, why do I need you?

00:55.520 --> 00:57.080
Then I guess my question would be like,

00:57.080 --> 00:58.520
well, then why are you paying home advisor?

00:59.280 --> 01:01.680
If you could do it, why haven't you done it yet?

01:02.640 --> 01:03.480
Right.

01:04.440 --> 01:05.280
And I'm not gonna,

01:05.280 --> 01:06.960
I know that like a lot of people want me to go,

01:06.960 --> 01:10.040
probably say, well, you should focus on your business

01:10.040 --> 01:11.120
and I'll focus on mine.

01:11.120 --> 01:13.040
It's like, no, call them out.

01:13.040 --> 01:15.360
Okay, Bob, go do it.

01:15.360 --> 01:17.680
And guess, I'd probably kind of be a little bit,

01:17.680 --> 01:19.520
I'd probably be a little tongue in cheek here

01:19.520 --> 01:22.520
and I'd go, I'd say something like along the lines of like,

01:23.520 --> 01:26.320
oh, I didn't know you had that skillset.

01:26.320 --> 01:27.280
If you have that skillset,

01:27.280 --> 01:28.600
like I'm looking for good people.

01:28.600 --> 01:30.480
Why don't you just build the website

01:30.480 --> 01:32.440
and then I'll buy the leads from you?

01:34.520 --> 01:36.440
No, seriously, because I think I can go get,

01:36.440 --> 01:37.600
sell them somewhere else for hire.

01:37.600 --> 01:39.800
Like, and honestly, if you know how to build them,

01:39.800 --> 01:43.120
then do it A for yourself and then we should talk

01:43.120 --> 01:45.760
because maybe you can help me with some of these webs.

01:45.760 --> 01:47.640
Like they're full of crap, okay?

01:48.800 --> 01:49.640
That's number one.

01:49.640 --> 01:51.880
The first part of it, which was,

01:51.880 --> 01:53.200
what was the first part of that question?

01:53.200 --> 01:56.080
Which was, what was it?

01:56.080 --> 01:57.960
Can you teach me to build my own website?

01:57.960 --> 01:58.800
Is that what you're referring to?

01:58.800 --> 01:59.640
Oh, yeah.

01:59.640 --> 02:03.160
If they ask that, I would just say, yeah, I can.

02:03.160 --> 02:05.200
But like, are you, you just want a website?

02:05.200 --> 02:07.080
Again, is it, can you,

02:07.080 --> 02:09.000
can you teach me to build my own website

02:09.000 --> 02:12.840
or can you teach me to get leads?

02:12.840 --> 02:13.680
Because there's a big difference

02:13.680 --> 02:18.240
between getting leads and building a website.

02:18.240 --> 02:20.080
Because if you just want to build a website,

02:20.080 --> 02:21.520
then why don't you just go to GoDaddy

02:21.520 --> 02:22.340
and throw up a website.

02:22.340 --> 02:23.180
But guess what?

02:24.020 --> 02:28.580
A website for a website's sake is a waste of money.

02:28.580 --> 02:29.980
If your website's not generating leads,

02:29.980 --> 02:31.340
why do you have a website?

02:32.460 --> 02:33.420
Yeah.

02:33.420 --> 02:36.660
Yeah, and the only other thing I'd add to that is,

02:36.660 --> 02:38.980
one, they're probably not qualified.

02:38.980 --> 02:40.260
So it's probably a business owner

02:40.260 --> 02:42.060
that you would want to work with in the first place.

02:42.060 --> 02:44.780
But then it also just goes back to the monopoly model

02:44.780 --> 02:45.620
that we talked about.

02:45.620 --> 02:47.500
Like, hey, the whole goal is to get your property,

02:47.500 --> 02:50.220
our property, and you get as many leads as possible.

02:50.220 --> 02:51.460
But if you don't want more leads,

02:51.460 --> 02:53.700
then you can just stick with your website.

02:53.700 --> 02:55.320
So. 100%.

02:55.320 --> 02:56.160
100%.
