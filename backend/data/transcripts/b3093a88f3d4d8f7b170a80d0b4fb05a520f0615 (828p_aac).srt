1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,520
If you didn't ask somebody for money today,

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,400
if you didn't prospect, guys, every single one of you,

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,940
if you're not on the phone every single day,

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,640
Monday through Friday, go ahead, take the weekend off,

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,560
I don't care.

6
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,600
I know when I was coming up,

7
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,440
I was working Saturday mornings minimum,

8
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,800
and I have kids and I got other stuff too,

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,180
but I was working Saturday mornings doing sales calls.

10
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,300
I was doing something sales related

11
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,800
every single day of the week.

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,360
You may not have the ability to ask somebody for money

13
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,360
every single day because you don't have enough deals

14
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,200
in the pipe.

15
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,360
Every single one of you should be on the phone

16
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,200
doing prospecting calls every single day.

17
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,520
But Nick, I don't have a campaign that's generating leads.

18
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,360
Who cares?

19
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,640
Go pick a random city and practice, okay?

20
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,100
Get good at doing it while you're waiting,

21
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,560
or go hook somebody in advance.

22
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,520
Find the area that you wanna go into

23
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,680
and hook somebody while you wait for the leads to come in.

24
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,220
I mean, heaven forbid, okay?

25
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:58,120
Guys, the work that actually moves the needle

26
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,280
is talking to business owners, doing sales.

27
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,560
That's the work that matters.

28
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,600
How much have you done this week?

29
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,680
My guess is that 99% of you guys haven't done jack shit.

30
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,520
That's the truth.

31
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,680
That's the truth.

32
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,500
Well, I watched some training videos.

33
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,200
I watched the live.

34
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,600
I spent an hour looking at due diligence.

35
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,200
Cool, good job.

36
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,020
Go do 100, then outsource it.

37
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,380
Go do 100 due diligence.

38
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:23,280
Master the process of finding a city and niche.

39
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,400
Go hire someone for pennies in the Philippines

40
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,000
and get that off your plate and focus on sales, okay?

41
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,200
Oh, but I wrote content.

42
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,040
Awesome.

43
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,640
Go write 20,000 words of content

44
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,020
for your first five websites.

45
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,100
Train somebody from the Philippines or Africa or whatever.

46
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,940
Create a process, outsource it.

47
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,040
Spend more time on sales.

48
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:40,880
You wanna make more money?

49
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,680
Spend more time on sales, okay?

50
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,360
Don't sit there and think that you're doing work

51
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,480
because you're watching videos

52
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,400
or you're listening to fricking Joe Rogan

53
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,380
or you're listening to Jocko Willink

54
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:53,100
talking about getting in the ice bath.

55
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,000
Do sales.

56
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,840
Call people.
