Sala found a city where two people are ranking in GMBs, but not in the organic CPC and search

00:04.320 --> 00:10.800
volume fit the criteria. Should I go for it? So that, that one right there, I would go a little

00:10.800 --> 00:18.240
bit further Sala. So what, what they're saying is they found a city where there's the two people

00:18.240 --> 00:22.960
that keep ranking over and over in the GMB. So that's kind of a red flag because ideally you

00:22.960 --> 00:26.880
want it to be mixed up, mixed up, mixed up, but that's, that's fine. But this, but they're also

00:26.880 --> 00:33.760
saying that the, in the organic rankings, they're not showing up on page one for those same terms.

00:33.760 --> 00:38.080
That's a good thing, but I would take it a step further and I would go look at those same companies,

00:39.280 --> 00:43.120
sorry, I would go look at the companies that are ranking on page one organically.

00:43.760 --> 00:51.360
And let's say the top two competitors and look at their backlinks, how many I would look at maybe

00:51.360 --> 00:56.720
like how much domain authority or how much, what's the other term that we use? Trust flow

00:56.720 --> 01:01.840
is the other one. If you use majestic, remember guys, we talked about backlinks like three weeks

01:01.840 --> 01:06.080
in a row. I would look at the quality of the backlinks. I'd also look at the age of the domain

01:07.280 --> 01:11.760
and I would just look at a couple of different factors before I just automatically assume in

01:11.760 --> 01:16.560
this situation though, I would be happy to take a look at it for you Sala. If that would make you

01:16.560 --> 01:22.320
feel better, make sure to message me, Ashley and fix it on a group thread. Great question.
