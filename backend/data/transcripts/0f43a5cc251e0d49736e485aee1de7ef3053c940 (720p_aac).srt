1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
I learned this back doing door-to-door sales, okay?

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,300
So for example, back doing door-to-door sales,

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,140
we were always taught that you do business,

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,120
people do business at the kitchen table, okay?

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,400
And that was, your chances of closing a deal

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,280
at the kitchen table were far better

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:22,280
than sitting at the couch with Jack, the retired Marine,

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,680
sitting at the couch while he's watching TV,

9
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,880
way better at the kitchen table because he's focused,

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,440
he's watching you, he's paying attention,

11
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,820
and we're doing business, okay?

12
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,060
So the equivalent of that, and this is the first thing

13
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:34,100
that I would say is a best practice,

14
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,740
I want you guys to write down,

15
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:39,660
is get them on a desktop or a laptop,

16
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,260
none of this phone bullshit, okay?

17
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:44,260
Here's why, if they're on their phone,

18
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,420
that gives them the ability to be in their truck,

19
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,300
that gives them the ability to be at the store,

20
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,660
that gives them the ability, who was I on the phone with?

21
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:55,000
I did a close with somebody, or maybe it was just me,

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,980
I can't remember who it was.

23
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,460
Oh, guys, she's not in this group, Preeti,

24
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,540
if you guys watch, I was on her close

25
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,180
when she closed the deal a couple months ago,

26
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:07,640
like three, four months ago, right?

27
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,940
And we didn't do this, well, she set the whole thing up,

28
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:14,940
I just hopped on, the guy was on his phone driving,

29
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:18,940
and he was buying dog food, like, we still got the deal,

30
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,180
we still got the deal, but he was buying dog food,

31
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,900
I was so pissed off, I'm like, bro,

32
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,300
we are literally talking right here,

33
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:29,300
and you're buying dog food, so make sure they're at a desktop,

34
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,840
make sure they're at a laptop, and if you do that,

35
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,580
they're not gonna be able to be driving around,

36
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:34,860
or doing this, or doing that,

37
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,380
or jotting down notes, or whatever,

38
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:37,280
make sure they're at a desktop.

39
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,980
Now, how do you do that without making it sound weird?

40
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:42,140
This is what I would recommend, I would say, hey,

41
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:45,700
if possible, please be at a laptop or a desktop,

42
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,320
because I wanna show you a couple things,

43
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,820
it's going to be really hard for you

44
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,600
to see on your tiny little screen.

45
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,740
That's how you're gonna do it, okay?

46
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,480
So the equivalent of sitting at the kitchen table,

47
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,240
in door-to-door sales, which me and Lincoln are familiar with,

48
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,600
and I know Marcus has done door-to-door sales as well,

49
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:07,100
is being at a desktop, being at a laptop, not on the phone.

50
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:11,200
Not on something that they can move around with, okay?

51
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,120
Something they gotta sit their ass down and pay attention.

52
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,360
What that's going to allow you to do,

53
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,320
it's going to allow you to get their attention,

54
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,880
and they're gonna move everything else,

55
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,300
and they're just gonna be focusing on you, okay?

56
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,880
It's gonna be really hard for them to get up,

57
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,720
and go get a drink,

58
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,360
because they're gonna have to carry their damn computer,

59
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,600
and if they're at a desktop, they can't, okay?

60
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,760
So make sure they're at a desktop, if at all possible,

61
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,120
and do it by saying, hey, I wanna show you a thing or two.

62
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,000
If you can be on a desktop or a laptop,

63
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,080
that's gonna make it way easier so you can see the screen.

64
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,800
It's gonna be really hard to see on your phone,

65
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,000
which is true, by the way.
