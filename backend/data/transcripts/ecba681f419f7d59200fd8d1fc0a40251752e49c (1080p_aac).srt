1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,380
All right, let's talk about the deal.

2
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:16,860
Let's talk about step three of the perfect prospecting script, which is explaining the

3
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:17,860
deal.

4
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:19,220
What is in it for them and what is in it for you?

5
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:24,260
And as I've talked about already, the more important part of this equation, which is

6
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:29,020
what's in it for the business owner and what's in it for you, it's way more, although it

7
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:33,780
sounds counterintuitive, it's way more important for you to explain to them clearly what's

8
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,580
in it for you than what's in it for them, because they already know what's in it for

9
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:38,580
them.

10
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,580
Okay.

11
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:42,780
They're already expecting you to shower them with reasons why it's a good deal for them.

12
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:49,820
But very, very few people, in fact, no one explains what's in it for the person calling.

13
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:53,100
So for example, home advisor, all they do is they call and they say, hey, you're going

14
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,820
to get, I'm going to give you leads, blah, blah, blah.

15
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:58,340
They don't turn around and say, hey, the reason that we're doing this is because we make a

16
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:01,140
shitload of money off of selling leads.

17
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,140
Okay.

18
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,140
Because guess what?

19
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:06,060
If they did that, they'd sell a whole lot more leads if they just said that.

20
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,780
But instead it's always like, oh no, we're just such good people.

21
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,840
And guys, that's the same reason you guys have been on calls with me.

22
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,740
That's the same reason why I tell you, hey, I'm going to take care of you.

23
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:15,940
I am going to over deliver.

24
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:18,700
I know you're expecting me to say that, but guess what?

25
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:19,860
Here's what's in it for me.

26
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:25,920
If I over deliver, I am going to grow this group and I am going to make a lot of money.

27
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,580
And I have no shame in talking about it.

28
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:29,620
I got no bones saying that.

29
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:30,620
Okay.

30
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:32,820
And when I say that, you respect it.

31
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,620
You're like, okay, that's what I thought anyway.

32
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,180
I'm glad he owns it.

33
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,180
Okay.

34
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,380
So I just wanted to point that out.

35
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:42,380
Do not be shy telling them, hey, this is what's in it for me.

36
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:43,380
Okay.

37
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:44,620
This do not, do not be shy.

38
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:46,280
Do not feel like you need to lie.

39
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,860
Do not feel like you need to hide.

40
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:51,180
Do not feel like you need to pretend to be a good person or that you're just helping

41
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,180
out.

42
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,180
I like to help local business owners.

43
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,180
Bullshit.

44
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,180
Okay.

45
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,180
Bullshit.

46
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,180
You're here to make money.

47
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:58,780
They don't know.

48
00:01:58,780 --> 00:01:59,780
They already know you're going to do that.

49
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:00,780
Okay.

50
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:01,780
I just want to point that out.

51
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:02,780
Let's dive in.

52
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:05,700
So guys, going back a little bit, the last thing that we did before we transitioned is

53
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,860
we explained, Mr. Business Owner, Jack, the reason I called you is because I saw you're

54
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,160
running paid ads on Google.

55
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,620
So I know you're hungry to grow.

56
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,540
Now we transition and we're going to transition.

57
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:21,100
The first thing we're going to do is we're going to tell them that we have a hot lead

58
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:25,300
for them and that we want to give them a couple leads in exchange for a conversation.

59
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,840
Okay.

60
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,960
Yeah.

61
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,800
So Jack, I'm merging these a little bit, but we get done.

62
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,480
Hey, the reason I'm calling you is because you're running ads.

63
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,600
So here's the deal is the reason I'm calling you, you know how I mentioned Silver Beach

64
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,600
Circle?

65
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,600
Yeah.

66
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,600
I have a lady.

67
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,600
Her name is Janet.

68
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,600
She needs a tree removed.

69
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,600
This just actually came through my website.

70
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,640
That's why I was calling you.

71
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,400
I want to give you this job.

72
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,400
Literally.

73
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,400
It costs you nothing.

74
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,400
I'm going to do it.

75
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,120
I don't care if you don't even return my call.

76
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,120
Okay.

77
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,780
However, I do want to mention this.

78
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:59,460
What I would like to do and the reason I called you specifically is I am looking for an ongoing

79
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,460
partner.

80
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,460
Okay.

81
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,460
Make no mistake about it.

82
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:06,080
I would like to give you this one, but I'd also like to give you about three to five

83
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,700
of these to just test out.

84
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,040
All I would ask in return, and the reason I'd be willing to do that is I would love

85
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,380
to talk about possibly working together in a couple of days or maybe a week, whenever

86
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,960
I can get you a couple of jobs.

87
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,960
Would you be open to that?

88
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,900
If I could just give you a couple for no charge and then we talk in a couple of days.

89
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,900
Okay.

90
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:25,720
Guys, that's all you got to say.

91
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,160
That's the whole step.

92
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,520
That's the deal.

93
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,520
You're going to get a couple of jobs.

94
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,940
First of all, I have a hot lead.

95
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:34,540
That's why I'm calling you, just to follow up from last step.

96
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,540
Okay.

97
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:38,760
And I would like to give you three to five for free.

98
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,420
That's what's in it for you.

99
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,620
What's in it for me is I want a conversation.

100
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,080
Are you good if we have a conversation?

101
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,080
Because here's the deal.

102
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,080
You're already spending money.

103
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,080
You're hungry to grow.

104
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,680
I have jobs.

105
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,880
I don't do the work.

106
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,780
You do the work and you need more jobs or you wouldn't be running ads.

107
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:56,700
So what if I get you a couple for free to prove that I'm not messing around and we talk

108
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,020
in a couple of days?

109
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,020
Okay.

110
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,020
No obligation, no commitment.

111
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:03,860
The only thing I ask in return is that you talk, is that we have a discussion.

112
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:04,860
That's it.

113
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:05,860
Are you good with that?

114
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:06,860
Cool.

115
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:07,860
And guys, that's it.

116
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:08,860
That is it.

117
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,860
And I don't even want to go any further.

118
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:15,060
Some other things that you can sprinkle in is I do at times, if I'm feeling a little

119
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:21,560
shaky or I'm a little bit more comfortable, I do like to sprinkle in, I like to name drop.

120
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,320
So let's say I'm targeting St. George.

121
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,120
So at this point, I would be like, maybe they'd say, yeah, I'm down.

122
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,120
I'm cool.

123
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,860
Cause like guys, that's a really, it's a, it's a, it's a no lose.

124
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,960
There's no risk for them, right?

125
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,880
The only risk is if you start saying, oh, it's good, good, good, and you don't explain

126
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:39,240
what's in it for you, they're going to say, yeah, I'm good because they just think it's

127
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,240
a scam.

128
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,240
Okay.

129
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,520
That's going to translate the scam.

130
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,560
They think it's a scam is going to translate into I'm good or I've got plenty of work.

131
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,760
They're really actually interested because they're running ads.

132
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,760
They just don't understand.

133
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,760
Okay.

134
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,480
At this point, if I'm feeling a little shaky, what I'll say is, Hey, do you guys know the,

135
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,080
you know, XYZ company down the road?

136
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,200
It's totally different.

137
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:03,000
These guys actually do, they do, they do tree service.

138
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You guys know them?

139
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Yeah.

140
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
So yeah.

141
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Tony's a great guy.

142
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Michelle's awesome.

143
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Yeah.

144
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,200
I've been working with those guys for two years doing the exact same thing.

145
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,440
I just send them the jobs.

146
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:17,240
We have a deal worked out where we, you know, I win, they win, I get paid, they get paid.

147
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,240
It's worked out super nice.

148
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,920
So anyway, so I'll do that.

149
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,400
So if it's somebody in their town, if I'm already working with somebody in St. George

150
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,760
or in Austin or whatever, I'll use, even if it's a different industry, I'll use somebody.

151
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,800
If it's somebody in the industry, I'll just drop the name.

152
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,040
So let's say I'm going, I'm in St. George and I'm targeting a company in Vegas or I'm

153
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,920
targeting company in Vegas, but I have somebody in St. George in Vegas.

154
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,960
I'd say, Hey, I know this is a little bit of a stretch, but you don't happen to know

155
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,760
that company up in St. George, a couple hours wait, it's called Provent.

156
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,160
I know that they've like done a few jobs down there.

157
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,160
Have you bumped into them?

158
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,160
Okay, cool.

159
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,480
Anyway, the guy's name is Joe.

160
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:55,880
I've been working with him doing something similar, not in your market, but in St. George

161
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,880
for about two years.

162
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,000
It's been awesome, man.

163
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,160
We've been working together forever.

164
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:03,760
So anyway, beside the point, and that's just a way of me building credibility.

165
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,680
Okay, guys, that's it.

166
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,680
That's the deal.

167
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,400
Again, most important part about explaining the deal is first of all, don't overthink

168
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,400
it.

169
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,400
Just explain.

170
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,400
I'm going to give you a couple of leads.

171
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,400
First of all, I got Janet.

172
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,400
She's hot, baby.

173
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,400
She's ready to roll.

174
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,400
Number one, you're going to explain that.

175
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,640
You're going to say, let me give you a couple for free.

176
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:24,320
Like literally, the only thing I ask in return is I want to have a conversation.

177
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,320
That's it.

178
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,920
I want to have a conversation about possibly working together.

179
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,920
That's it.

180
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,920
Explain it.

181
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,600
Then again, we're going to transition after this point if they've agreed and said, yeah,

182
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,600
that sounds good.

183
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,600
I'm okay with that.

184
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,920
Say, oh, awesome.

185
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:40,660
What's the best email and phone number to send these leads to?

186
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,440
I'm just going to go right into it.

187
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:46,840
What's the best email and phone number to send these leads to?

188
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,600
Because if you ask that question and they're not following you, they ain't going to give

189
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,600
you the email.

190
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,600
They're not going to give you the phone number.

191
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,600
Okay?

192
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,600
That's where I'm going to leave this video.

193
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,100
I'll see you on the next one.
