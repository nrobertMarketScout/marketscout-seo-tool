00:00.000 --> 00:16.560
All right guys, step one of the perfect prospecting script is who you are and the pattern interrupts.

00:16.560 --> 00:19.120
There's three questions that we're going to ask, but first what we're going to do is we're

00:19.120 --> 00:20.400
going to do a pattern interrupt.

00:20.400 --> 00:24.720
What I mean by that is back when I was doing door-to-door sales, as I like to relate a

00:24.720 --> 00:28.480
lot of these stories, is we would knock on the door knowing people hated us.

00:28.480 --> 00:31.160
People hate door-to-door people, just like your business owners.

00:31.160 --> 00:34.240
These business owners that we talked to, they hate people calling their phone.

00:34.240 --> 00:36.480
They just do not like it.

00:36.480 --> 00:41.080
We got to look at what is everybody else doing and how do we do it differently?

00:41.080 --> 00:45.800
One thing that we would do back when we did door-to-door is we knew we were already at

00:45.800 --> 00:46.800
a disadvantage.

00:46.800 --> 00:50.320
People hated door-to-door people, but there was a specific type of door-to-door that they

00:50.320 --> 00:53.720
loathed and that was magazine guys.

00:53.720 --> 00:56.880
I've never seen a magazine girl, that's why we call it magazine guys.

00:56.920 --> 01:00.880
They were sketchy, they were scammy, they always stole your money.

01:00.880 --> 01:02.720
People just hated them.

01:02.720 --> 01:05.640
One of the pattern interrupts I use, and I'm just giving you an example, is I'd knock

01:05.640 --> 01:07.840
on the door and be like, hey, my name's Nick, I'm with Vivint.

01:07.840 --> 01:11.480
By the way, Vivint's the company I used to work for, by the way, I'd say, by the way,

01:11.480 --> 01:15.000
I'm not the magazine guy, don't worry, and I'd put my hands up like this.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.760
If I got a laugh out of people, I knew I had some air time.

01:17.760 --> 01:19.960
I'm like, yeah, let me show you what I'm doing real quick.

01:19.960 --> 01:23.800
I got right into it, transitioned in, but it was all about interrupting that pattern

01:23.880 --> 01:27.160
instead of just being the guy that's like, hey, my name's Nick, I'm with a company called

01:27.160 --> 01:33.480
Vivint, and we're doing home security, like guys, that is so cringe, okay, and likewise,

01:33.480 --> 01:36.480
and this is the first thing I want to talk about before we get into anything, is the

01:36.480 --> 01:41.600
one thing you're not gonna do is you're not gonna call and drop the name of your agency

01:41.600 --> 01:43.280
and be salesy, okay?

01:43.280 --> 01:45.520
This is a bad, this is what you don't want to do.

01:45.520 --> 01:52.520
Hi, Jake, this is Nick with Evergreen Enterprises, and I'm calling you about lead generation.

01:53.360 --> 01:56.880
Okay, bad, stop, do not do that, okay?

01:56.880 --> 01:58.400
Here's how we're gonna pattern interrupt.

01:58.400 --> 02:00.080
We're gonna look at what everyone else is doing, okay?

02:00.080 --> 02:01.600
Think about it, what's everyone else doing?

02:01.600 --> 02:05.600
Everyone else, home advisor, angelist, et cetera, they're calling and they're saying,

02:05.600 --> 02:07.880
yeah, hey, is this the business owner?

02:07.880 --> 02:13.720
Hey, Mr. Business Owner, and they go into this BS pitch about ranking on page one and

02:13.720 --> 02:17.280
this and that, and it's roundabout and it's all this different stuff.

02:17.280 --> 02:22.200
The way that we're gonna be, we're gonna do this pattern interrupt is we're gonna go firing

02:22.200 --> 02:24.920
right in, asking them questions, okay?

02:24.920 --> 02:27.760
We're gonna be direct and we're gonna ask them questions and we're gonna ask them three

02:27.760 --> 02:28.760
questions.

02:28.760 --> 02:32.840
Our pattern interrupt is intertwined with these three questions, okay?

02:32.840 --> 02:38.120
So, first question that you're gonna ask is you're gonna ask if they do a specific service

02:38.120 --> 02:39.120
within the service.

02:39.120 --> 02:43.040
So, for example, if you're doing concrete, you're gonna say, hey, Jake, Nick here, quick

02:43.040 --> 02:46.160
question, do you guys do patios, okay?

02:46.160 --> 02:49.520
Do you guys do patios and driveways?

02:49.840 --> 02:55.320
Or, hey, Jake, Nick here, do you guys do tree removal or just tree trimming?

02:55.320 --> 02:59.920
Do you guys actually do the removal or do you guys do stump removal, okay?

02:59.920 --> 03:03.880
You're gonna ask a question pertaining to the service, okay?

03:03.880 --> 03:08.160
You almost wanna make it seem like they're gonna think, is this a customer?

03:08.160 --> 03:09.560
Is this a contractor?

03:09.560 --> 03:11.280
Is this, like, they don't know, okay?

03:11.280 --> 03:12.280
Is this a lead gender?

03:12.280 --> 03:13.280
They're not gonna know.

03:13.280 --> 03:15.800
You're gonna pattern interrupt because you're gonna go right into it.

03:15.800 --> 03:16.800
You're gonna take advantage.

03:16.800 --> 03:18.400
Instead of pitching them, you're gonna ask questions, okay?

03:18.400 --> 03:20.600
If someone else wants to pitch, we're gonna ask questions, okay?

03:20.600 --> 03:22.600
Hey, Jake, do you guys do patios?

03:22.600 --> 03:23.600
Awesome, okay?

03:23.600 --> 03:24.600
That's question one.

03:24.600 --> 03:25.600
Ask about the service, okay?

03:25.600 --> 03:27.840
All right, guys, second question.

03:27.840 --> 03:31.200
You're gonna ask that question and then the second question you're gonna ask is if they

03:31.200 --> 03:33.240
cover a specific area.

03:33.240 --> 03:36.720
The best way I've found, yes, you can say, hey, do you cover this zip code, but what

03:36.720 --> 03:41.880
I think is better is knowing the area and using, like, a suburb name.

03:41.880 --> 03:43.240
That's like, it's gold.

03:43.240 --> 03:47.200
So, for example, I live in a city called St. George and if you look at the map, you're

03:47.200 --> 03:52.160
gonna see there's a main city, St. George, then I live in Washington, technically.

03:52.160 --> 03:55.200
It's actually St. George, but everyone would say I live in Washington.

03:55.200 --> 03:56.680
Then there's a place called Santa Clara.

03:56.680 --> 04:02.040
These are technically cities with their own zip codes, but within St. George, okay, I

04:02.040 --> 04:05.240
live in this area called Little Valley, okay?

04:05.240 --> 04:06.840
Everyone just calls it Little Valley.

04:06.840 --> 04:09.760
So what I would say, like, let's say I was targeting Vegas.

04:09.760 --> 04:14.000
After I asked, hey, do you do patios, cool, awesome, and you guys cover Summerlin, right?

04:14.240 --> 04:19.040
Like, I'm targeting Vegas, but I'm gonna ask, do you guys cover Summerlin?

04:19.040 --> 04:23.040
Now what this is gonna do, it's, first of all, again, they're just like, what the heck?

04:23.040 --> 04:27.680
Secondly, you wanna make sure that this customer is gonna be interested in that lead, okay,

04:27.680 --> 04:28.680
because it's in Summerlin.

04:28.680 --> 04:30.540
Now don't ask about some stupid area.

04:30.540 --> 04:32.400
Ask about the area the lead is in, okay?

04:32.400 --> 04:36.240
So if the lead is actually in Las Vegas, go ahead and ask about the street.

04:36.240 --> 04:39.120
Hey, do you guys cover Silver Beach Circle?

04:39.120 --> 04:40.120
That's the street I live on.

04:40.120 --> 04:42.000
Do you guys cover Silver Beach Circle, okay?

04:42.480 --> 04:44.240
They're like, what, where's that?

04:44.240 --> 04:47.320
Zip code's 84790, okay, cool, yeah, yeah, yeah, we do.

04:47.320 --> 04:49.240
Okay, that's question two.

04:49.240 --> 04:51.640
Question one is a question about the service.

04:51.640 --> 04:53.560
Question two is a question about the area.

04:53.560 --> 04:57.960
Question three, you're gonna ask them how far out they are, okay?

04:57.960 --> 04:59.640
Okay, awesome, last question for you.

04:59.640 --> 05:01.480
How far out are you with giving service?

05:01.480 --> 05:03.640
Like, how far out are you to do an actual trigger mobile?

05:03.640 --> 05:04.960
How far out are you pouring concrete?

05:04.960 --> 05:06.760
I know it's really busy, like, are you guys gonna be able

05:06.760 --> 05:08.400
to take anything before this decade's over?

05:08.400 --> 05:09.880
Like, sometimes I'll joke.

05:09.920 --> 05:12.160
Can you guys actually cover, can you get to something

05:12.160 --> 05:14.520
before the end of this fiscal year?

05:14.520 --> 05:16.600
Like, holy crap, like, I'll kind of joke to them.

05:16.600 --> 05:18.320
They're like, oh, yeah, yeah, we are a little backed out.

05:18.320 --> 05:19.280
And they're like, oh, two months.

05:19.280 --> 05:20.640
Oh, no problem, not a big deal.

05:20.640 --> 05:23.560
And then I'll usually say, what about for an estimate?

05:23.560 --> 05:25.280
Like, what if I just need an estimate?

05:25.280 --> 05:26.480
Like, how far out are you?

05:26.480 --> 05:28.040
Oh, we can do that by the end of the week.

05:28.040 --> 05:29.000
We can do that in 24 hours.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.240
We can do that next week, cool, okay?

05:31.240 --> 05:32.600
And these are what you're gonna do.

05:32.600 --> 05:34.000
You're gonna ask these three questions

05:34.000 --> 05:36.360
and then you're gonna do a miniature transition, okay,

05:36.360 --> 05:38.080
into the second step.

05:38.080 --> 05:39.000
Now, I don't wanna confuse you

05:39.000 --> 05:42.240
because I told you that there's four main parts to this,

05:42.240 --> 05:43.320
right?

05:43.320 --> 05:46.000
Who you are, which is part of the pattern interrupt,

05:46.000 --> 05:49.440
what you're doing, okay, damn good reason, the deal,

05:49.440 --> 05:51.200
and then I said transition, and now I'm telling you

05:51.200 --> 05:53.040
there's miniature transitions, there is.

05:53.040 --> 05:54.240
Between each one of these steps,

05:54.240 --> 05:55.920
there's just these miniature transitions

05:55.920 --> 05:57.720
because you don't wanna just pause, okay?

05:57.720 --> 05:59.240
So you get done, okay, cool,

05:59.240 --> 06:01.480
it's 24 hours to give an estimate.

06:01.480 --> 06:03.240
And then what you're gonna do is you're gonna transition

06:03.240 --> 06:05.100
into why you're calling.

06:05.100 --> 06:08.360
Awesome, Jake, so anyway, the reason I'm calling you,

06:08.400 --> 06:11.600
okay, you're gonna get into why you're calling

06:11.600 --> 06:13.200
and that's gonna be, that's gonna segue us

06:13.200 --> 06:14.040
into the next step.

06:14.040 --> 06:18.280
So, guys, don't be, recap, don't be salesy,

06:18.280 --> 06:20.280
don't use your agency name, just get to the point.

06:20.280 --> 06:22.320
Our pattern interrupt is we're gonna ask three questions,

06:22.320 --> 06:23.880
bang, bang, bang, and we're gonna transition

06:23.880 --> 06:27.480
into why we are calling,

06:27.480 --> 06:31.360
and we're gonna be giving a damn good reason

06:31.360 --> 06:32.720
why the hell we're calling.
