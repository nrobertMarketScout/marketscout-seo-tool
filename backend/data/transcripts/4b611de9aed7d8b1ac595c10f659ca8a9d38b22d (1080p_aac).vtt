Alright guys, it's time to jump in to the core content.

00:14.640 --> 00:19.840
It's time to get in, pick our city and niche and get going and get deals coming in and

00:19.840 --> 00:21.400
close that first deal.

00:21.400 --> 00:25.360
But I want to share really quick, this is how I want you to attack the content, okay?

00:25.360 --> 00:29.280
I know I've been in other programs where they tell you, hey, watch the whole thing and then

00:29.280 --> 00:31.320
come back and watch it again and do it.

00:31.320 --> 00:34.960
I know I've been in other programs that just tell you all sorts of different things and

00:34.960 --> 00:36.200
I'm not telling you that.

00:36.200 --> 00:37.200
Here's what I want you to do.

00:37.200 --> 00:40.200
I want you to watch a module, okay?

00:40.200 --> 00:43.880
So we start with module one and then I want you to do the thing.

00:43.880 --> 00:46.600
So module one talks about picking the city and picking the niche.

00:46.600 --> 00:50.720
So you're going to watch that module and then you're going to pick the city and the niche.

00:50.720 --> 00:54.560
And you're not going to go to module two until that's done, okay?

00:54.560 --> 00:57.000
Then once you've picked the city and the niche because you've done the homework and the whole

00:57.040 --> 01:01.040
deal, then you're going to go to module two and you're going to learn how to build a list.

01:01.040 --> 01:02.040
And guess what?

01:02.040 --> 01:05.080
You're going to build a list before you go to module three and you're not going to go

01:05.080 --> 01:06.800
to module three until you build the list.

01:06.800 --> 01:12.480
Because what I know is that in the times I have just gone and gone through all the content,

01:12.480 --> 01:16.040
what happens is I listen to all this and I'm like, oh, cool, well, I'm just kind of like

01:16.040 --> 01:20.520
passively soaking things in and I'm like, I get done, I'm like, oh my gosh, that's a

01:20.520 --> 01:22.160
lot, that's a lot.

01:22.160 --> 01:25.720
But if you take it in bites and you watch the first module and you don't allow yourself

01:25.800 --> 01:30.040
to go to the next one until you've done the thing, done the actual action step, you have

01:30.040 --> 01:35.000
a lot more, you go a lot quicker because you're just, you're tacking it in chunks, okay?

01:35.000 --> 01:38.520
So I do want you to watch the module and then do it.

01:38.520 --> 01:40.080
And then watch the next one and then do it.

01:40.080 --> 01:41.840
And then watch the next one and then do it.

01:41.840 --> 01:46.480
Because then by the time we get to module seven, we are pitching the business owner,

01:46.480 --> 01:47.480
okay?

01:47.480 --> 01:48.760
And we're getting a deal.

01:48.760 --> 01:50.000
That is my advice.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.600
Another little piece, I've had people that have gone through all of this in one day.

01:53.600 --> 01:58.360
My recommendation is to watch a module a day and consume this over a week's time or maybe

01:58.360 --> 02:00.880
even a little bit longer.

02:00.880 --> 02:04.880
It's up to you, but I've had students that have literally watched every module in one

02:04.880 --> 02:09.640
day and I'm telling you right now, even though it's my own stuff, I would probably want to

02:09.640 --> 02:13.600
blow my brains out and I probably wouldn't retain much by the end of the day.

02:13.600 --> 02:19.360
So I think the very best way to do this is watch a module and do it and do one module

02:19.360 --> 02:22.760
a day and do it well, okay?

02:22.760 --> 02:25.400
So guys, let's freaking do this.

02:25.400 --> 02:28.680
Let's jump into module one, watch it, and then do it.
