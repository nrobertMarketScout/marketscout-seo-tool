Enon says, it just seemed that Queen Creek was pretty obvious right off the bat.

00:03.680 --> 00:08.240
A lot of the areas, yeah, and that's probably true, but you notice the difference.

00:08.240 --> 00:10.880
Let me show you. Well, I can just share my screen and show you this.

00:15.360 --> 00:16.560
Okay, let's look at this.

00:17.200 --> 00:26.000
Population, Queen Creek, Arizona is 59,000 a couple of years ago. Let's look at we say if we type in 2023.

00:28.720 --> 00:38.320
Okay, 78,000. Let's do the same thing for Jacksonville, Florida, almost a million.

00:38.320 --> 00:48.080
Okay, so let me just say this, Enon. The more population, usually the more business owners,

00:48.080 --> 00:57.200
usually the more variables. And so I would go as far as to say that the lower population cities,

00:57.200 --> 01:01.040
it's going to be more cut and dry. And that is why I mentioned in the training,

01:01.120 --> 01:08.400
I have done very, very well in going into this as small of city as possible that still has the

01:08.400 --> 01:14.640
search volume. So I start at the 50,000 or the 40,000, and then I look and I'll look at 20 cities

01:14.640 --> 01:19.280
and find the one or two that actually have enough search volume. And then I'll start doing due

01:19.280 --> 01:24.480
diligence instead of like my rule of thumb is if I look at a map, and I look at the map, and I look

01:24.480 --> 01:29.680
at the map, and I look at the map, and I look at the map, and I look at the map, and I look at the

01:29.680 --> 01:36.560
map, and I can see the city, everyone else can see the city, and that's probably on their list to

01:36.560 --> 01:42.880
go and look at first. That makes sense? So I understand the frustration is like, well, obviously,

01:42.880 --> 01:49.120
Nick, Queen Creek was cut and dry. Go look at cities between 50,000 and 80,000 across the US

01:49.120 --> 01:53.840
in pavers, and you're going to see stuff that's a lot more cut and dry. The bigger the city,

01:53.840 --> 02:00.400
the more competition, the more variables. And that's just the reality. Now, also in that same

02:00.400 --> 02:05.120
breadth, usually the bigger the win. If you can get ranked, like I would love to see somebody that

02:05.120 --> 02:12.480
has SEMrush, go and type in that Jacksonville paversfl.com. Go look at the amount of traffic.

02:12.480 --> 02:17.360
I bet they're getting a hell of traffic because it's such a big city. But I'm telling you, Edward,

02:17.360 --> 02:26.800
I would not be going into that city. It's too competitive. It's too big. The CPC is too high.

02:26.800 --> 02:30.560
Okay. Hopefully, that answered your question, Ema.
