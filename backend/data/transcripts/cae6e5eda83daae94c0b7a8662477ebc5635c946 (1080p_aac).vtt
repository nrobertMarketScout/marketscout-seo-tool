you have to remember the people we're selling to online have a bad taste of everybody they've

00:06.560 --> 00:13.360
dealt with online. So the fact that you're coming in and showing them the social proof helps them

00:13.360 --> 00:17.040
get over the fact that I'm not the only one about to get suckered. It's like,

00:17.040 --> 00:22.640
okay, they're legit because they actually have clients. And it just gives them a little bit more

00:23.760 --> 00:28.960
of a comfort when they hear that other people are using your service first, like,

00:28.960 --> 00:30.800
oh, I'm going to get scammed by this guy.
