Never give more than five free leads to close a deal never ever ever never ever ever never ever ever. I know for me before I had my process before I was a lab in 20 it was where I was a scientist in a lab.

00:15.000 --> 00:20.000
Coming up with this process and just breaking it down piece by piece.

00:20.000 --> 00:28.000
I thought for some reason I need to set to send leads for three weeks two weeks a month 20 leads 2530 leads.

00:28.000 --> 00:40.000
I just thought that's what you needed to do I thought you need to send a certain number of leads. You do not need to send more than five leads, and a lot of cases I send three, and some cases I send one.

00:40.000 --> 00:51.000
Never send more than five free leads there's a sweet spot when you send a couple. It's, it's sexy it's interesting it's okay I'm playing along.

00:51.000 --> 01:05.000
But when you send too many over too long a period of time that sexiness that newness that value starts to get diminished starts to get watered down, and they, they almost become entitled.

01:05.000 --> 01:17.000
As if you need to keep giving them leads until they close the deal it's like bitch I ain't wait for you to close the deal. That's not the arrangement. If I was closing these deals I go start my own company, you got to close a deal.

01:17.000 --> 01:23.000
I'm letting you test these out right home advisor didn't even let you have one for free.

01:23.000 --> 01:30.000
Angie's list sure didn't let you have one for free, and Google ads didn't give you any lead you just got a bunch of clicks that led to wasted money.

01:30.000 --> 01:37.000
I'm giving you cold heart well warm hard leads these people actually want these estimates.

01:37.000 --> 01:45.000
So guys, never give more than five free leads and less if it feels right and they feel ready. Okay.
