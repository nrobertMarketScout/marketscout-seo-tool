Bruce says, do you do press releases for your Legion sites?

00:05.600 --> 00:09.920
I've heard they can help new sites get a small amount of traction.

00:09.920 --> 00:13.560
I don't know, just personally, okay?

00:13.560 --> 00:15.240
And I can't even speak on that.

00:15.240 --> 00:20.560
I've been part of groups, I've been pitched on doing press releases.

00:20.560 --> 00:22.360
I know people have different opinions.

00:22.360 --> 00:29.040
I have built my billion dollar seven figure $100,000 month agency,

00:29.080 --> 00:33.280
literally doing the keyword, building my keyword list,

00:33.280 --> 00:36.480
the way I teach you guys how to do it in the training.

00:36.480 --> 00:39.000
Literally sitting down and it helps if you have a dual monitor,

00:39.000 --> 00:42.400
but you don't have to sitting down when I didn't have a dual monitor,

00:42.400 --> 00:46.440
I would print off a list of the keywords and I would be typing on my content.

00:46.440 --> 00:50.000
I would start with five questions and I would literally go through

00:50.000 --> 00:52.800
and I'd start writing and every time I would do a keyword,

00:52.800 --> 00:57.440
I'd make a check mark or a strike and I would manually check

00:57.480 --> 01:01.680
and make sure I included as many keywords as possible, but didn't overuse it.

01:01.680 --> 01:04.840
And then when I got the dual screen, I would have the keywords over here

01:04.840 --> 01:07.720
and the document over here and I would do the exact same thing,

01:07.720 --> 01:08.920
except it was digitally.

01:08.920 --> 01:14.000
And I have built a seven figure agency writing content, old school.
