1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,960
all right so I just logged in into our own designer Weebly account just because

2
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,840
we want the website to be in our own we're going to create a website for

3
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:21,440
Queens Creek Arizona concrete now concrete is pretty general make sure

4
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:25,320
you're talking obviously to your client like some concrete companies they do

5
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:33,080
driveway patios they do crack repairs they do concrete paving they do stamp

6
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:38,640
concrete so make sure and this it goes back to your keyword list that you are

7
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,120
targeting only the services that the company does because certain companies

8
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,880
do certain things and not everything so once you're logged in you're probably

9
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:52,720
not going to have any of these because these are all of our old websites so

10
00:00:52,720 --> 00:01:03,160
you're going to click up here top right create website and okay so here you're

11
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:08,760
going to pick your theme this is kind of up to you I'm going to pick one of the

12
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:18,080
ones that we usually use and keep in mind that once you create one frame you

13
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,680
can actually duplicate your website so let's say you have a second concrete

14
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,200
company you can actually just duplicate your first one so you don't have to do

15
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,120
this whole thing from the very start but I am going to show you on how to get it

16
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:39,200
started for the first time so let's go with this one right here okay and we be

17
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,520
likes to kind of create a website for you but we're going to delete every page

18
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,520

19
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:58,080

00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:02,200
you're going to delete that one can stay there for a second you're going to click

21
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,320
on pages up here and I just want to get rid of everything that we've created

22
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:12,680
for me because we're not going to need it so click on delete confirm let's

23
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:19,200
delete every page that they made for you because we want to create our own and in

24
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:25,000
the home one just click on SEO settings make sure there's nothing here okay go

25
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,920
back now we're going to delete everything so every element that was put

26
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:36,160
in here we want to delete because we're trying to make our own you might just be

27
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,440
able to click here perfect and delete the whole section that way you don't

28
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:46,440
have to delete every single piece manually so just click delete it should

29
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:53,240
just eliminate the whole thing okay and then do it again and delete perfect so

30
00:02:53,240 --> 00:03:00,880
pretty fast pretty easy now click on build up here let's add a title up here

31
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:10,480
in the header section and then we are going to add okay so add so we're going

32
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,280
to click down here on installed apps click on the plus sign where it says add

33
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:21,680
app and we're going to add some elements are not into designer Weebly already so

34
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:29,640
in the search bar just type h1 and we're going to add this one right here h1 tag

35
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:33,680
okay should be free so you don't have to pay for it click on it then click on

36
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:43,840
add connect and done perfect and now it should show up here okay so we can add

37
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:51,600
that right here at the bottom okay perfect now we are going to add another

38
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:59,280
title under our title right here okay so in this top title in the header we're

39
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,280
going to put the company's name obviously we're not going to put the

40
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,600
actual company's name we're just putting the service that we're targeting and

41
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:13,060
the location so in our case it's going to be and I like to put everything in

42
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:24,360
capital letters Queens Creek oops concrete okay I don't like going into

43
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,200
separate sentences I like to be in the same line so I'm going to make it

44
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:33,400
smaller and then we can go back and edit the fonts because they look a little

45
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:38,040
cartoonish and then we're going to add a phone number right now we don't have a

46
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,800
phone number so you can just put like xxx just so you know that's where you're

47
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:47,760
going to put the phone number okay all right now we're going to put some text

48
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:52,960
at the bottom of the h1 I like to put a little spacer there this is up to you on

49
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,280
how you want to structure it you can put a spacer you can put a divider the

50
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:03,040
divider is just a line so it's right here and then under there right here so

51
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:08,640
what we like to do is have the h1 right here a text here we like to put a corner

52
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:14,920
image right here so drag the image until you see this little shape see how the

53
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,600
shape is gone and now the shape is back it looks like a square when you see that

54
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:24,240
square you just drop it the mouse and once you we put an image right here now

55
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,360
right now it looks a little funky but once you put the image right here you

56
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:34,680
are going to have the text right next to it and now we're going to put the quote

57
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:39,640
form the instant quote form right to your right of your text so right here

58
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:46,680
it's called a contact form on Weebly so we're just going to hold in grab it and

59
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:54,480
drop it right here perfect this is how we want it to look like and now we're

60
00:05:54,480 --> 00:06:00,640
going to create the quote form and we usually put free a hundred percent

61
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:06,120
something again we're not making this website to make them look amazing and

62
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:11,480
fancy we just want them to convert so we wanted them to be simple clear to the

63
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:17,640
point of what people are getting and how to reach the contractor in the

64
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:24,480
easiest and fastest way as possible so free a hundred percent instant quote

65
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:29,560
because we want them to think that they're going to get the quote right away

66
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:36,760
okay I actually like to put this making myself so I'm going to delete that and

67
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:46,520
we don't need a comment section so let's just leave the email put a large text

68
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:57,960
box above the email this is no let's do a short short text box okay perfect and

69
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:02,000
you're going to click on it right here in the fill title you're going to put

70
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:13,400
name okay and then we are going to put checkboxes will we arrange the order

71
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:20,720
just put that and then we're going to put a drop-down box and then do not

72
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,960
forget this we need the phone number because if we don't then our client

73
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:31,600
cannot call the lead back so make sure the name phone number and the email

74
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,600
right there one important thing this should be automatically done by Weebly

75
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:40,360
but make sure there is a little asterisk it's red and tiny at the top quarter that

76
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:44,840
means that the person that is filling out the quote is required to fill out

77
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,480
that information in order to submit the quote if you don't do that then people

78
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:52,520
can't skip on the number and how you check it is actually right here once you

79
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:57,640
click on the field it's required is checked out see if I unmark it the

80
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:02,400
asterisk goes away so make sure that's on because we don't want anyone skipping

81
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,480
on any information because if someone fills this out and we don't have any

82
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:11,560
more phone number it's a lost lead so and how we like to order this is

83
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:20,200
actually to put what the client needs at the top and then gathers information at

84
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:24,200
the bottom because people are more likely to fill it out if they can fill

85
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,600
out their needs first and then tell you who they are instead of the other way

86
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:39,320
around okay so we're going to change this field to what service do you need

87
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:43,640
and again you can customize this to whatever your niche is to whatever you

88
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:50,000
think would be best option items right here you can add as many as you want so

89
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,520
I like to put the services that the client offers so in this case it could

90
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:07,520
be concrete driveway oops driveway concrete patio these are just some

91
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:15,840
samples we can put stamped concrete okay and if you click add option you can add

92
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:21,520
as many as you like if you click on edit you can actually delete them and you can

93
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:25,920
also move them so you can have stamp concrete at the second and stuff like

94
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:31,440
that and then you click on done click out of it and you're done with that this

95
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:40,660
one I like to put when do you need do you need it question mark option items

96
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:59,500
I'm going to put I am flexible this week and then as soon as possible okay so we

97
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:04,020
are done making the form and there is something else that we like to add but

98
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,220
make sure you check in with the client and make sure that that's something

99
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:11,380
that they could possibly offer so first of all we like to center this since

100
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:16,380
it's the title so center it right there then you're going to add a spacer so

101
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:24,620
it's not so cramped and then we usually like to add a text right under the free

102
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:37,220
instant quote where we say something like plus free bonus coupon just to kind

103
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:41,060
of get them more interested again checking with the client and see if they

104
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:44,860
could even offer a slight coupon or something like that if they don't then

105
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:51,820
just remove that and we're going to center that let's make that bold as well

106
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:58,740
see it and then lastly the button right here see how it's skirted to the left we

107
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:04,580
want to make a center as well so just click on the main thing you're going to

108
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:10,220
click on button you're going to align it to the center and we're actually going

109
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:16,220
to change what it says I like I would like to say get quote exclamation point

110
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:23,380
then click out of it then oops I don't know why I did that it's not a problem

111
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:27,140
just move them back how they wear

112
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:44,020
okay perfect and then one last thing when if you click on form options you can

113
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:48,700
actually name this and what we like to name it just to keep it organized it

114
00:11:48,700 --> 00:12:01,580
would be the same as the title of the website in our case it's Queen Creek put

115
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:07,580
the state concrete and then since this is the form for the home page I like to

116
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:12,300
put in parentheses I like to put an H you can also put home whatever you are

117
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:16,700
more comfortable with something like that and then right here is where you're

118
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:21,980
going to put the email you want this form sent to you so I'm just gonna put

119
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:29,340
my email I wait every time I get this form so I get forwarded to mine okay

120
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:35,660
then click save and we're done with the form creation okay now I would like to

121
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:39,060
put more sections because especially on the home page we're going to add a lot

122
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:47,340
of content so go right here under structure you're going to select section

123
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:52,940
and you're going to drag it right below right here I like to put a couple of

124
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:59,780
section because this is the very first one let's put a second one okay and then

125
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:11,700
we're going to add some titles in here and text then you can put a divider once

126
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:15,980
we have the content and we're adding the content we can also switch things out

127
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:21,460
but just to have it there already prepared for us we'll do this and then

128
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:32,780
let's use this for images so let's put some images perfect let's add another

129
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:49,180
section underneath text put a divider spacer another title up here and we'll

130
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:52,540
go more in depth in the next videos about content and how to structure that

131
00:13:52,540 --> 00:14:00,860
so don't worry about it right now right now we're just framing out our asset and

132
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:10,140
here at the bottom okay so this is the home page now what we usually do for our

133
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:14,820
websites and this depends on your competitors so when you do the due

134
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:18,220
diligence you're going to have the top three websites are ranking and you're

135
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:22,500
going to see what their website looks look like if your competitor has ten

136
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:26,940
service pages we definitely want to beat them but on average what we like to do

137
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:34,340
is create one home page three service pages and a contact page so what you do

138
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:38,980
after this one is the frame is built out you click on pages and you're actually

139
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:43,060
going to click on the plus sign right here we are going to make a non

140
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:48,460
clickable menu this is where you'll have drop down with the services and you're

141
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:59,420
going to put the page name as services out of it done okay now click I would

142
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:02,820
actually like to just duplicate the home page because we already have that quote

143
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:11,100
form it just saves you time so click on home and click on copy and it's just

144
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:15,460
going to duplicate it so we're going to change the name of it you're going to in

145
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:20,900
my sample for my client I would like to call this stamped concrete that's one of

146
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:24,220
the main services and again you want to pick the three service pages to

147
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:30,260
represent the main most searched three services in that niche in that location

148
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:36,100
that your client covers okay make sure there's nothing in the SEO settings

149
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:40,820
always make sure and you're very attentive to details this is very

150
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:47,140
important when you do things like that okay so the title and the number will

151
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:52,540
always remain consistent and the same in every page down here the h1 we haven't

152
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:56,160
even put in so we don't need to worry about the only thing is remember when we

153
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:01,300
created the quote form in the form name just make sure you switch that I just I

154
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:06,500
would just put service one oops service one save it and then everything else

155
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:13,220
can stay the same we should actually add the phone number at the bottom as well

156
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:18,140
so let's make a separate section right here at the bottom so we don't forget

157
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:24,620
and drag a title in and we're going to put another the same phone number we're

158
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:28,220
just going to put it down align it in the center and let's do that on the

159
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:31,940
homepage as well so right at the bottom after you're done writing all of your

160
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:40,220
content you're going to have a section that is just having the phone number

161
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:48,140
xxxx align the center let's create the other two pages and once you're done so

162
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:51,860
this looks perfect the only thing is we want to make it underneath the service

163
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:56,700
how you do that see you just see when you screwed it over it gives that gap

164
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:04,260
right here and boom it's right here so let's just copy this one as well and

165
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:09,100
make sure that it's underneath there as well we're going to call this concrete

166
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:17,380
driveway make sure the quote form says s2 so you know this is service page

167
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:24,900
number two and then we're going to copy it again make our last service page and

168
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:28,860
again you can go in and add it and make as many as you like this is just the

169
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:35,780
average of what we usually do I'm going to call this patio and just make sure the

170
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:42,140
quote form says three and then we're going to add a contact page the contact

171
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:49,660
page is very simple it's actually going to be so it's not going to be under

172
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:56,980
so we want home services and home again that is going to be contact contact us

173
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:03,100
and then you can actually delete every section because the only thing the

174
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:07,980
contact page is going to have is a big form to fill out for them and then on

175
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:13,900
the contact page we also add the link to the Google My Business so we definitely

176
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:18,180
want this phone number down there but you can go ahead and delete the content

177
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:23,980
and just have the main quote form right here I don't know why did that see

178
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:28,660
that's why you want to pay attention to you tell sometimes often designer we

179
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:31,820
believe it we believe in general we have little glitches so you want to make sure

180
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:38,820
that everything looks how we first set it up on every page

181
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:50,260
name number and email going to save it see it's already looking different for

182
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:58,660
some reason so just make sure it all looks the same

183
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:15,700
save again attention to details is very important when you're building out this

184
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:20,220
framework so just make sure that everything looks consistent because if

185
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:23,780
it if it doesn't you know if you have stuff like this coming up to someone

186
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:29,300
it's going to look not very professional so just touch it up make sure you're

187
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,700
checking every page even if we did duplicate them just double and triple

188
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:40,540
check on things being very consistent on each page same with the header and you

189
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:48,260
again you shouldn't have to do this all the time sometimes it does this

190
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:25,580
see that pretty sure there you go okay service to last service page and we are

191
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:46,420
almost done building the frame of our asset right here make sure you always

192
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:53,980
click save as well and then perfect this looks good the only thing that sometimes

193
00:20:54,100 --> 00:21:00,060
we like to do but this is totally optional click on build and sometimes

194
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:04,180
just to make the quote pop especially if you're using a white background under

195
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:11,500
the header so just like this one is called we like to use a color block so

196
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:16,180
just drag this right above the quote okay like that and then you're going to

197
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:22,740
drag the whole quote form in it like that now it's not going to look like it's

198
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:29,020
anything but you can actually change that's how you make the quote in a

199
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:34,860
different color and this sucks in Weebly but you it's you don't only have this

200
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:39,820
option you can actually put your own colors here and how you do that is I

201
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:46,020
think if you click here and change color it will give you a color palette okay I

202
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:55,100
know it's at the bottom but let's say we wanted to make it a nice and bright

203
00:21:55,100 --> 00:22:05,980
yellow a little more orange like that you can copy this code I don't know why

204
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:16,860
it's not copying it click out of it change color okay I'm just going to write

205
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:25,780
it down so it's F1 AB 40 okay you click again on the color block and you change

206
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:30,860
color and you can insert your own color so you don't have to pick out of these

207
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:37,980
ones one eight be forty click out of it and it will make it that color okay

208
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:44,860
perfect and it moved the surfaces again

209
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:57,220
okay perfect and you're going to this to do this for every page again now you're

210
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:00,460
probably looking at the quote from this is one when you make colors and

211
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:03,860
adjustments and stuff like that you're going to see well you can't really see

212
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:07,780
here right and if you click up here in this desktop you can actually see how

213
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:14,180
the website would look on phone so keep that in mind as well like this looks

214
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:20,420
gigantic it looks silly on a phone so and the spacer we probably want to remove

215
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:24,940
because it's a really big gap so click back here and once you we are done

216
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:29,820
adding the content we're going to do the little touch-ups but just really quick

217
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:36,020
click on theme this is where you can change the color and the fonts and we

218
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:42,100
please nice so he actually highlights what things are you see it's going to

219
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:46,980
highlight that the paragraph title can remain the same the paragraph text we

220
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:52,100
want to make it black because it's pretty hard to see there you go and then

221
00:23:52,100 --> 00:24:02,060
you can change the font let's try things out okay feel like that's all more

222
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:06,740
visible and then we are going to delete the spacer again it's totally up to you

223
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:12,900
just kind of how you see things going and then this we like to do it a

224
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:24,060
different color and the one above this a little bigger oops make sure you save

225
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:33,380
save save let's make this a little more yellow and then again this is up to

226
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:52,140
your preference just can even make it blue okay 40 CDF one see if that looks

227
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:59,860
better again don't overthink this but you can definitely make smaller

228
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:09,380
adjustments okay and we are done building the frame
