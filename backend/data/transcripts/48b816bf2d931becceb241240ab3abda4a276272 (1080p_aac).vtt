After you've hooked the business owner, you're going to send the leads.

00:03.040 --> 00:06.640
You got leads coming in, you hook the business owner, you got to send them a couple leads.

00:06.640 --> 00:13.320
Here's my tip, never send more than five leads, but as soon as they close one, go for the

00:13.320 --> 00:14.320
close.

00:14.320 --> 00:17.360
You send them one lead, they go and run it that night, they close it, go for the close.

00:17.360 --> 00:20.560
Get on a Zoom call, go close it, go for the close.

00:20.560 --> 00:27.960
Now at the same time, do not feel that or think that the business owner has to make

00:28.080 --> 00:31.080
money before you can go for the close because they don't.

00:31.080 --> 00:35.980
And I've got tons and tons of different examples where I have sent two, three leads, the business

00:35.980 --> 00:40.960
owner scheduled one for tomorrow, one for Friday, one for next week, and I just feel

00:40.960 --> 00:43.960
like it's time to go and I've gone and closed the deal tomorrow morning.

00:43.960 --> 00:47.020
They don't even run the leads, much less close the leads.

00:47.020 --> 00:49.840
So don't think that they need to make money at all.

00:49.840 --> 00:53.280
Now if they make money, even better, but if you don't, you don't have to send them leads

00:53.280 --> 00:55.200
until they make money.

00:55.200 --> 01:00.240
You just need to send them leads so they can see the quality and the style and how you

01:00.240 --> 01:05.680
operate and what it's going to be like working with you and make sure it's a great experience.
