WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.040
Okay, guys, unemployable peeps, fellow rank and renters, what's going on, guys?

00:09.040 --> 00:11.680
We're going to do a really just super impromptu.

00:11.680 --> 00:16.280
I messaged Stephanie yesterday and I was like, hey, what do you think about going live with

00:16.280 --> 00:17.280
me tomorrow?

00:17.280 --> 00:19.760
And she you're like, well, it depends on what time.

00:19.760 --> 00:22.960
And then I like two hours ago, I'm like, what about in two hours?

00:22.960 --> 00:26.120
And she's like, I have a, you know, she had a closing call or something.

00:26.120 --> 00:27.360
She's like, but I think I can make it work.

00:27.360 --> 00:28.360
So let's do it.

00:28.920 --> 00:31.000
We didn't give anybody a heads up, by the way, here's Porter.

00:31.000 --> 00:31.880
We'll let him in really quick.

00:31.880 --> 00:33.320
We didn't give anybody a heads up.

00:33.320 --> 00:37.640
We've just decided to go live, share her story, do this interview and look at this.

00:37.640 --> 00:38.280
We've got dogs.

00:38.280 --> 00:39.080
We've got babies.

00:40.600 --> 00:41.880
I got to get something on my lap.

00:43.240 --> 00:45.080
Bro, where's your kids at?

00:46.120 --> 00:46.680
Yeah, I know.

00:47.480 --> 00:49.080
So Stephanie, what's your dog's name?

00:49.640 --> 00:50.120
This is Mike.

00:50.120 --> 00:51.000
This is my niece.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.840
This is Gracie girl, Gracie dog.

00:52.840 --> 00:53.960
I like the name of me.

00:53.960 --> 00:54.200
Great.

00:54.200 --> 00:57.400
Ever since I watched the show Armageddon, I always loved the name Grace.

00:57.400 --> 00:58.920
Really?

00:58.920 --> 00:59.560
Grace.

00:59.560 --> 01:03.400
And then we got Ford over here just munching on his hand or his toy.

01:04.600 --> 01:05.560
Just going hard, dude.

01:05.560 --> 01:06.280
I got the bottle.

01:06.280 --> 01:07.240
I got a burp rag.

01:07.240 --> 01:08.600
Just I'm ready to rip, dude.

01:08.600 --> 01:10.600
How old is, how old is Ford now?

01:10.600 --> 01:11.880
He's only, he's four months.

01:12.520 --> 01:15.640
Oh, is, is Ford doing anything productive at the house?

01:15.640 --> 01:16.600
He doing deals yet?

01:16.600 --> 01:19.480
Or is he just like nursing and pooping?

01:19.480 --> 01:20.680
Just sleeping and pooping.

01:20.680 --> 01:22.920
But hey, he did sleep eight hours yesterday.

01:22.920 --> 01:26.680
So get, get this baby, get this baby a whoop watch.

01:26.680 --> 01:28.440
Let's see what kind of REM sleep he's hitting.

01:28.440 --> 01:29.240
Oh, dude.

01:29.240 --> 01:30.200
He slept like a baby.

01:30.200 --> 01:31.080
I had to check his pulse.

01:31.080 --> 01:31.720
I was nervous.

01:32.840 --> 01:33.400
I love it.

01:33.400 --> 01:35.320
Well, Porter, thanks for hopping on Stephanie.

01:35.320 --> 01:36.040
Thanks for being on.

01:36.040 --> 01:37.640
Anybody else that's on, appreciate you.

01:37.640 --> 01:41.080
I know this is super just out of nowhere, but I hope a bunch of people will see this

01:41.080 --> 01:41.480
interview.

01:41.480 --> 01:47.000
So guys, today I want to interview Stephanie, me and Porter want to interview Stephanie

01:47.000 --> 01:52.360
and talk about how to pre-sell your way to $8,600 per month.

01:53.000 --> 01:59.000
Um, Porter is also just so you guys know, just to, to have an idea of why I have him

01:59.000 --> 02:01.960
on here, he's making a, is it 10, 10, six now Porter?

02:02.520 --> 02:03.560
Yeah, 10, six.

02:03.560 --> 02:06.200
I asked you that and making sure you didn't cancel seeing if you got any other deal.

02:06.200 --> 02:09.800
So is that 10, six, uh, $10,600 per month.

02:09.800 --> 02:11.960
Uh, I think a hundred percent of those are also pre-sales.

02:12.600 --> 02:13.240
Yeah.

02:13.240 --> 02:13.960
Okay.

02:13.960 --> 02:15.960
So, um, I wanted to have these two on.

02:15.960 --> 02:17.480
We're going to be interviewing Stephanie though.

02:17.480 --> 02:21.080
But guys, the reason why I wanted to interview Stephanie is I love interviewing

02:21.080 --> 02:26.440
people that I've worked with that I've literally watched start from zero, knowing nothing about

02:26.440 --> 02:27.000
the business.

02:27.560 --> 02:30.760
And then they persevere their way to where they're absolutely crushing it.

02:30.760 --> 02:32.360
They've got momentum on their side.

02:32.360 --> 02:34.920
And, uh, that's exactly what we've got here with Stephanie.

02:34.920 --> 02:41.400
So, um, I looked this up before the interview, Stephanie, you, you started working with me

02:41.400 --> 02:45.880
or you started, I guess, let's just say you started, uh, pre-selling or you started focusing

02:45.880 --> 02:49.560
on the sales piece of this business on May 31st, 2024.

02:49.560 --> 02:50.680
So let's call it June 1st.

02:50.680 --> 02:55.880
So it's been 10 months, nine months, not even, not even that.

02:55.880 --> 02:56.120
Okay.

02:56.120 --> 02:57.880
Something, something like that.

02:57.880 --> 03:02.520
And, uh, the interesting thing about Stephanie, and I'm excited to really get to hear her

03:02.520 --> 03:07.240
story, but she didn't just, you know, sling five deals in the first week.

03:07.240 --> 03:11.640
She, if I remember correctly from the post and from everything else, like there was a

03:11.640 --> 03:15.480
little bit of a learning curve and there was some setbacks and stuff like that.

03:15.480 --> 03:18.120
So, um, is that, is that, am I getting that right?

03:18.120 --> 03:20.760
Or am I confusing this story with somebody else's?

03:21.400 --> 03:21.640
Yeah.

03:21.640 --> 03:22.760
No, you're a hundred percent correct.

03:22.760 --> 03:23.400
I'm not a fronter.

03:23.400 --> 03:25.080
I didn't, I didn't crush it out of the gate.

03:25.640 --> 03:26.120
Yeah.

03:26.120 --> 03:27.320
I was a late bloomer.

03:27.320 --> 03:29.720
So, I mean, I'm, I'm gunning for you Porter now.

03:29.720 --> 03:30.440
Like I'm, I'm crushed.

03:30.440 --> 03:33.080
I'm going to be in five figures and I'm gunning for you, Papa.

03:33.080 --> 03:39.720
But, um, so if you, once you pass Porter, I think there needs to be, you do send me

03:39.720 --> 03:40.120
a message.

03:40.120 --> 03:43.800
We'll, we'll do some kind of a little, uh, some little spit for you because I can't,

03:43.800 --> 03:45.960
and I hope you do a post just roasting Porter.

03:46.360 --> 03:50.600
Hey, I got, I got one cooking Stephanie, this, this week.

03:50.600 --> 03:51.560
Did I for cooking?

03:51.560 --> 03:52.520
I have for cooking.

03:52.520 --> 03:53.560
Oh, yeah.

03:53.560 --> 03:56.520
Stephanie's got for cooking, but you're, you're, I don't know, man.

03:56.520 --> 03:58.520
Um, they're in the air fryer.

03:58.520 --> 03:59.560
They're not in the slow cooker.

03:59.560 --> 04:03.480
Like I'm telling you, like what I love about pre-sell, like I call it like pre-sell is

04:03.480 --> 04:04.120
a microwave.

04:04.120 --> 04:07.960
I'm like screw it, like no, no offense to Chevy and all the organic people out there.

04:07.960 --> 04:09.000
God bless you.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.440
But I am not into like that.

04:10.440 --> 04:12.760
I call that the kimchi, like fermentation method.

04:12.760 --> 04:14.760
I'm like, I don't have, I'm too fricking impatient.

04:14.760 --> 04:20.040
And, and, and because I'll play devil's advocate, I think that a healthy bill, uh, uh, a really

04:20.040 --> 04:22.760
healthy business, you probably have a combination of both.

04:22.760 --> 04:27.000
So, um, maybe what we should do to, cause there might be some people that watch this

04:27.000 --> 04:31.160
that are on later that, um, like what the heck is pre-sell?

04:31.160 --> 04:32.680
What, what are you guys talking about?

04:32.680 --> 04:36.440
I'm sure a lot of people do know what that is, but, um, it, let me have Porter, Porter

04:36.440 --> 04:37.400
explain what we mean.

04:37.400 --> 04:39.400
Cause obviously everybody knows the traditional method.

04:39.400 --> 04:42.680
You pick a city, you pick a niche, you build a website, you start a business, you start

04:42.680 --> 04:46.600
a city, you pick a niche, you build a website, you start doing SEO, it ranks, then you start

04:46.600 --> 04:47.960
worried about selling it.

04:47.960 --> 04:49.000
Porter really quick.

04:49.000 --> 04:53.320
Why don't you just explain in a, in 10 seconds, what, what it is that we do when we talk about

04:53.320 --> 04:53.880
pre-selling.

04:54.920 --> 04:59.720
So basically instead of rank and rent, it's rent, then rank.

04:59.720 --> 05:04.680
So build a one pager, run Google ads, use the leads that we get, sell them to a business

05:04.680 --> 05:05.000
owner.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.440
And then as soon as you collect credit card, go in and build it out.

05:09.320 --> 05:11.560
So you're just, you're flipping the model completely.

05:11.880 --> 05:14.440
Stephanie, anything you want to add to that definition or that description?

05:15.160 --> 05:15.880
No, no.

05:15.880 --> 05:18.600
I mean, I just a hundred percent Porter nailed it.

05:18.600 --> 05:22.360
I mean, it's really, it's just a matter of you're, you're getting the money up front.

05:22.360 --> 05:27.640
So then that you then can backfill it and do all the other fun stuff on the back end.

05:27.640 --> 05:32.040
But you have a business owner who is paying you and then you can just block and load

05:32.040 --> 05:32.760
onto the next one.

05:33.320 --> 05:37.480
You know, what else is cool or what I was thinking about in like, cause I always like to

05:37.480 --> 05:41.320
use an analogy or think about it as like regular real estate, but you know,

05:41.320 --> 05:48.280
um, with, if you were to build apartments, let's say, of course there's people out there

05:48.280 --> 05:49.320
that have a bunch of money.

05:49.320 --> 05:52.760
They go, they, they, they, they've done it for so long.

05:52.760 --> 05:54.840
They know what a good piece of land looks like.

05:54.840 --> 05:55.880
They know the right location.

05:55.880 --> 05:58.520
They know what it should cost per square foot, all that stuff.

05:58.520 --> 06:01.640
They get investors, they put these projects together and then they start selling them.

06:01.640 --> 06:01.880
Right.

06:02.680 --> 06:07.000
But there's also people in like Dubai, for example, where these big companies,

06:07.960 --> 06:11.640
I think it's called the Mac, the mock, these guys go in, they have the plan.

06:11.640 --> 06:12.920
Then they start pre-selling.

06:12.920 --> 06:14.840
They bring you in, they show you their showroom.

06:14.840 --> 06:16.840
They say, Hey, we're going to do this plan for you.

06:16.840 --> 06:19.960
You're actually going to pay for this right now and you're going to help us build it.

06:19.960 --> 06:21.560
We're going to get you a lower rate.

06:21.560 --> 06:25.240
But by the time this thing's built, it's going to be worth $50,000 more.

06:25.240 --> 06:30.520
And you're going to have an apartment or a space in this, this huge complex

06:30.520 --> 06:31.800
that you're going to own.

06:31.800 --> 06:36.040
And so they literally have it self-funded by investors, by people like me and you.

06:36.040 --> 06:38.840
So it's the exact same thing, guys, instead of us going and putting our own money,

06:38.840 --> 06:42.840
our own effort, our own risk, we're literally going and saying, Hey, Mr.

06:42.840 --> 06:46.040
Business Owner, I need you to fund the project that I'm going to own.

06:46.600 --> 06:48.120
And what do you think?

06:48.120 --> 06:51.080
And it sounds crazy if you think about it in like a real estate context,

06:51.080 --> 06:56.040
because in the real estate example, the customer or the business owner would own the property.

06:56.040 --> 06:58.920
But in this example, we own the property, even though they fund it.

06:58.920 --> 07:00.760
So I like that.

07:00.760 --> 07:01.320
I want to jump it.

07:01.960 --> 07:08.280
Like, that was a little bit convoluted for my pea brain because I'm back in the US.

07:08.280 --> 07:11.320
But in terms of real estate, I love that.

07:11.320 --> 07:14.040
Because years ago, you know, I'm down in Vegas.

07:14.040 --> 07:18.040
I know you're up a little north, but they had all these track homes, right?

07:18.040 --> 07:20.920
And so they have phases and they roll them out in phases.

07:20.920 --> 07:24.360
And if you buy in phase one, by the time they're still in phase seven,

07:24.360 --> 07:27.000
they've already increased in price, exactly.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.400
What we're doing is kind of like we're selling out of a trailer.

07:29.400 --> 07:30.760
They haven't even built one yet.

07:30.760 --> 07:35.400
So people are buying off plans, like they don't see it.

07:35.400 --> 07:40.040
And so that developer is taking all those deposits and those sales

07:40.040 --> 07:41.960
and using that money to build out everything.

07:41.960 --> 07:49.720
Or they're building out either that development or they're using it to buy another parcel,

07:49.720 --> 07:51.560
then to chop it up and do the same thing.

07:51.560 --> 07:53.480
So it's OPM.

07:53.480 --> 07:54.520
It's other people's money.

07:54.520 --> 07:55.480
That's a great term.

07:55.480 --> 07:56.760
OPM, other people's money.

07:56.760 --> 07:59.880
The only difference between the examples that we're using and this

07:59.880 --> 08:02.520
is that we're actually owning the property.

08:02.520 --> 08:05.560
Whereas in those examples, the person paying the money would own the property.

08:05.560 --> 08:09.560
We also get to own control and keep the property

08:09.560 --> 08:13.160
that we can then go and sell eventually and all this other stuff.

08:13.160 --> 08:14.600
So super exciting.

08:15.320 --> 08:18.680
The cool part about it, guys, is that if you guys are in this program

08:18.680 --> 08:21.000
and you guys are in Unemployable, you guys are in the right place.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.160
You have the fundamentals down pat.

08:23.160 --> 08:26.760
Shiv is the best in the game when it comes to teaching all things,

08:26.840 --> 08:29.880
SEO, backlinks, content, building a site, ranking a site.

08:30.600 --> 08:33.800
And then what I do is I like to show people how to do it fast.

08:33.800 --> 08:35.320
And so that's what we're going to talk about today.

08:36.360 --> 08:38.360
So let me just share my two goals for this interview.

08:38.360 --> 08:40.600
Number one is I want to inspire and motivate you guys

08:41.160 --> 08:45.000
that if you'll stay the course, that you are in the right place

08:45.000 --> 08:46.360
and you will find success because you're going to see

08:46.360 --> 08:48.760
that didn't happen overnight for either of these two people.

08:48.760 --> 08:52.840
And then I want to at least give you one actionable takeaway

08:52.840 --> 08:56.600
that you can take this week and implement and push it into your business

08:56.600 --> 08:58.040
to move the needle in the right direction.

08:58.040 --> 09:02.680
OK, so here's the reason, Nick, why are you doing this?

09:02.680 --> 09:03.480
Why are you coming to this group?

09:03.480 --> 09:08.520
Well, the reason why, guys, is that I did this exactly like you guys are doing it.

09:08.520 --> 09:11.400
I did the rank, then the rent.

09:11.400 --> 09:12.600
I did it did work.

09:12.600 --> 09:15.000
I got deals, but I could never scale.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
I could never get to the numbers I wanted.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.840
Money that excited me was one hundred thousand a month.

09:18.840 --> 09:21.640
And I started doing the projections and it just never made sense

09:22.120 --> 09:25.640
for me to go build out a hundred websites to then try and scale.

09:26.280 --> 09:29.480
And so as soon as I figured out pre-selling, it unlocked

09:30.200 --> 09:31.800
two things that were constraining me.

09:31.800 --> 09:32.760
Number one is time.

09:32.760 --> 09:34.440
Number one, number two is money, right?

09:34.440 --> 09:37.240
Because now I use other people's money, like Stephanie said, OPM.

09:37.240 --> 09:39.640
And I don't have to wait six months for a website to rank.

09:39.640 --> 09:42.520
So I've got some questions I want to ask Stephanie.

09:42.520 --> 09:44.920
And then I'll let you guys ask any questions you have, Porter.

09:44.920 --> 09:47.640
I'm probably going to ask you some, Porter, if you have questions for Stephanie.

09:47.640 --> 09:50.360
But I just want to run through these and we'll keep this nice and tight.

09:50.360 --> 09:53.800
And hopefully there's at least one person that we help on this live.

09:53.800 --> 09:55.640
And then hopefully a bunch of other people will see it.

09:55.640 --> 09:56.440
Okay. So that's not fair.

09:57.480 --> 09:58.120
Cool.

09:58.120 --> 09:59.000
Amazing. Okay.

10:00.920 --> 10:05.000
Okay. Real quick, because I don't know if anyone knows the full story,

10:05.000 --> 10:09.480
but let's just talk before this whole world of digital real estate.

10:09.480 --> 10:10.760
What were you doing for work?

10:12.280 --> 10:18.200
The one year before I started this, I worked for a 501C3, which in the U.S.

10:18.200 --> 10:19.320
That's a nonprofit.

10:19.320 --> 10:19.820
Yep.

10:20.840 --> 10:23.880
I was a salaried employee for $40,000 a year.

10:25.160 --> 10:30.520
And I taught elementary school kids how to grow fruits and vegetables and plant gardens.

10:31.880 --> 10:32.440
Interesting.

10:33.960 --> 10:37.240
I did that for one year because I had just moved back to the United States.

10:37.880 --> 10:42.600
For the 13 years prior to that, I was living in Europe and New Zealand.

10:42.600 --> 10:48.040
And so I was, but right before that, like during COVID and everything, I was in Greece

10:48.040 --> 10:51.000
and I ran for 10 years, I ran a vegan cooking school.

10:51.800 --> 10:52.280
Okay.

10:52.280 --> 10:53.560
It's pretty much like rank and rent.

10:54.120 --> 10:54.360
Yeah.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.240
No, but I've always been in sales.

10:57.240 --> 11:05.560
And so I love planting, I love food, I love landscaping, and I love teaching.

11:06.680 --> 11:08.920
And so I was on my feet.

11:08.920 --> 11:10.440
And then when I came back to the U.S.

11:10.440 --> 11:12.920
And I had to move back to the U.S. because my parents are old

11:12.920 --> 11:15.080
and I had to come back to see them.

11:15.080 --> 11:16.440
Otherwise I would still be in Europe.

11:17.320 --> 11:19.080
So I came.

11:19.080 --> 11:19.400
Hold on.

11:19.400 --> 11:20.360
So where are you at right now?

11:20.360 --> 11:21.320
What city?

11:21.320 --> 11:21.800
Vegas.

11:22.520 --> 11:22.840
Okay.

11:22.840 --> 11:24.040
That's why I thought that.

11:24.040 --> 11:27.480
And I was thinking, and you just really referenced Vegas, but for some reason, anyway.

11:27.480 --> 11:28.040
So, okay.

11:28.040 --> 11:28.760
Good old Vegas.

11:28.760 --> 11:30.520
How's the, by the way, real quick, not to detract, but-

11:30.520 --> 11:31.640
Dude, it's freaking raining today.

11:31.640 --> 11:32.040
It's raining.

11:32.040 --> 11:32.760
Oh, okay. Good.

11:32.760 --> 11:33.800
I'm glad you're suffering as well.

11:33.800 --> 11:34.600
All day.

11:34.600 --> 11:36.840
Like, like, yeah, I was like, where's my raincoat?

11:36.840 --> 11:37.480
Yeah.

11:37.480 --> 11:37.640
Yeah.

11:37.640 --> 11:39.240
Porter, is it snowing in Parowan?

11:40.120 --> 11:40.520
Tonight.

11:40.520 --> 11:42.200
It's supposed to snow a couple inches tonight.

11:42.200 --> 11:44.360
So you guys need it, but keep it over there.

11:44.360 --> 11:45.960
Are you in St. George, Nick?

11:45.960 --> 11:48.360
I'm in St. George, but Porter's like an hour north.

11:48.360 --> 11:48.600
I know.

11:48.600 --> 11:49.400
It's not that far.

11:49.400 --> 11:49.640
Yeah.

11:49.640 --> 11:49.880
Yeah.

11:49.880 --> 11:50.040
Yeah.

11:50.040 --> 11:52.760
It's raining here, but it's going to snow there because it changes a lot.

11:52.760 --> 11:53.640
The temperature of that.

11:53.640 --> 11:55.160
I have all my besties are up.

11:55.160 --> 11:55.720
They all go up.

11:55.720 --> 11:57.160
They're all up at Duck Creek.

11:57.160 --> 11:57.560
Oh, okay.

11:57.560 --> 11:57.720
Yeah.

11:57.720 --> 11:58.200
Yeah.

11:58.200 --> 12:00.200
That's going to be cold in Duck Creek for sure.

12:00.200 --> 12:02.680
And if you're up there, you say Duck Creek, not Duck Creek.

12:02.680 --> 12:04.120
Just let's get the record.

12:04.120 --> 12:04.520
Okay.

12:04.520 --> 12:05.000
All right.

12:05.000 --> 12:05.400
Guess what?

12:05.400 --> 12:07.000
I know it's hurricane and not hurricane.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.920
I got it.

12:08.920 --> 12:09.640
I got it.

12:09.640 --> 12:10.680
You know the area.

12:10.680 --> 12:11.640
So, okay.

12:11.640 --> 12:12.920
So you were doing, right?

12:12.920 --> 12:17.640
A year before, you were working for a nonprofit and now you're doing this.

12:17.640 --> 12:22.040
So in all of your previous years when you were in Europe, did you ever have any sales experience,

12:22.040 --> 12:23.800
tech experience, anything like that?

12:23.800 --> 12:24.120
Okay.

12:24.120 --> 12:27.960
So I have less than no tech experience.

12:27.960 --> 12:30.280
I would tell people, I'm like, I can't even spell IT.

12:32.360 --> 12:33.720
That's actually kind of a funny joke.

12:34.600 --> 12:38.440
Like literally, I had people, I thought about it today.

12:38.440 --> 12:45.640
The last time I used Excel was when I came to UNLV in 1991 for graduate school.

12:47.160 --> 12:50.280
By the way, that was the year I was born and they were really good that year too.

12:50.280 --> 12:51.000
Dude, the running rebel.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.320
Dude, like F Duke, by the way.

12:53.320 --> 12:54.760
Like I bleed red.

12:54.760 --> 12:56.280
I'm a running rebel all through and through.

12:56.280 --> 12:57.080
F Duke.

12:57.080 --> 12:57.320
Yeah.

12:58.120 --> 12:59.800
Anyway, yes.

12:59.800 --> 13:02.680
So no, I can't stand IT.

13:02.680 --> 13:04.200
I always outsourced it.

13:04.200 --> 13:09.080
I have a back, before I had a cooking school, I have a background and I was a recruiter.

13:09.080 --> 13:10.280
I was a headhunter.

13:10.280 --> 13:11.880
I have a background in selling mortgages.

13:11.880 --> 13:13.160
Like I've always been in sales.

13:13.800 --> 13:16.600
So the sales problem was nothing for you, but the tech.

13:17.560 --> 13:17.800
Yeah.

13:18.600 --> 13:18.840
Okay.

13:18.840 --> 13:23.320
This isn't a question I had, but how is selling this different than selling

13:24.120 --> 13:25.800
mortgages or anything else that you've sold?

13:27.880 --> 13:28.760
Well, it's a lot easier.

13:29.720 --> 13:34.120
It's because it's your Costco thing, right?

13:34.120 --> 13:35.720
Because you give them free samples.

13:35.720 --> 13:38.200
Like I can't sample you on a freaking mortgage.

13:38.200 --> 13:39.640
I so agree with that.

13:39.640 --> 13:40.520
Like, you know, like, okay.

13:40.520 --> 13:43.080
So now that, you know, like for those who are like kind of high,

13:43.080 --> 13:44.280
it's a little high level here.

13:44.280 --> 13:46.280
If you don't know what I'm talking about, you know, go look it up.

13:46.280 --> 13:49.400
But, you know, you don't have a lead magnet in mortgages really.

13:49.400 --> 13:50.360
Like, what am I going to do for you?

13:50.360 --> 13:53.160
Like, okay, I can run a free credit report for you.

13:53.160 --> 13:53.400
Yeah.

13:53.400 --> 13:56.600
But I can't let you feel how it is to be in the new house.

13:56.920 --> 13:58.520
I'm not going to do like a little demo closing,

13:58.520 --> 14:00.600
you know, like, you know, signing.

14:00.600 --> 14:02.120
I mean, like, you know, you got to cut.

14:02.120 --> 14:03.880
There's a little bit, there's a little more faith.

14:03.880 --> 14:05.320
You know, you're betting on the come.

14:05.320 --> 14:09.960
So, you know, in terms of the cook, my cooking school, people were like,

14:09.960 --> 14:13.640
I would sell these big giant packages and they're like, you know, like,

14:14.280 --> 14:16.200
I was like, my biggest package was like, you know,

14:16.200 --> 14:19.240
$7,000 to come train with me in Europe.

14:19.240 --> 14:21.960
And so these, I was selling, I taught in English,

14:21.960 --> 14:24.440
even though we were in Spain and Greece, but we taught in English,

14:24.440 --> 14:25.640
because it's an international language.

14:25.640 --> 14:28.600
So I was selling to people from India and Canada and Australia.

14:28.600 --> 14:31.480
So they had to buy their ticket to come stay with me for a month.

14:32.680 --> 14:34.920
And then they had to pay me $7,000.

14:34.920 --> 14:36.200
And then they had to also lock,

14:36.200 --> 14:40.280
put themselves up in a hotel or Airbnb for seven weeks or whatever.

14:40.280 --> 14:43.640
So it was, you know, it was high ticket sales.

14:43.640 --> 14:45.160
And they're like, how do I know you're any good?

14:45.160 --> 14:48.040
I'm like, well, you don't, but they can watch videos.

14:48.600 --> 14:51.080
You know, like, here's an example.

14:51.080 --> 14:54.760
So I could do a little bit of, you know, free sampling,

14:54.760 --> 14:55.560
but you don't know.

14:56.280 --> 15:00.120
But what we're doing right now with the way you do the pre-sales,

15:00.120 --> 15:02.040
we're giving them sample leads.

15:02.040 --> 15:03.320
They're the exact same thing.

15:04.040 --> 15:07.000
It's not like, it's not a scaled down, it's not an abridged version.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.360
It's the exact same thing.

15:10.360 --> 15:13.640
As long as you make sure you give them good leads.

15:13.640 --> 15:15.000
I mean, you don't want to give them scrub leads.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.640
You know, you cherry pick your own leads

15:17.640 --> 15:19.320
and then you send them to the BO.

15:19.320 --> 15:19.820
100%.

15:21.240 --> 15:23.960
From somebody, I sold, of course, a couple of different things,

15:23.960 --> 15:26.520
but selling alarm systems compared to this, I always tell people,

15:27.400 --> 15:31.240
this is like, not that it's easy per se,

15:31.240 --> 15:34.520
because it's obviously takes some work and some skill once you,

15:34.520 --> 15:36.200
but you don't, by the way, just so you know,

15:36.200 --> 15:37.800
you don't need sales experience to do this.

15:38.760 --> 15:40.520
Porter had zero sales experience.

15:40.520 --> 15:43.000
The only thing he ever did in terms of work was worked on the farm.

15:43.640 --> 15:46.200
For me, I sold door to door and selling this,

15:46.200 --> 15:47.320
I sit there and I'm like,

15:47.320 --> 15:48.760
people are complaining about picking up the phone.

15:48.760 --> 15:50.920
I'm like, look, you don't have to knock on a door.

15:50.920 --> 15:52.680
You don't have to go in the sun or under the rain.

15:52.680 --> 15:54.200
You don't have to get the door signed on you,

15:54.200 --> 15:56.120
a gun pulled on you, any of this kind of crazy stuff.

15:56.120 --> 15:57.320
You get to pick up the phone.

15:57.320 --> 16:00.200
And not only do you get to do it from the comfort of your home,

16:00.200 --> 16:02.040
but you get to call and say,

16:02.040 --> 16:05.160
do you want something free that you're already paying for?

16:05.160 --> 16:06.440
I mean, how hard of a sale?

16:06.440 --> 16:08.520
That's the initial sale.

16:08.520 --> 16:10.520
And then you're into the actual sales process.

16:10.520 --> 16:13.160
So Porter, for you on this note,

16:13.160 --> 16:16.680
how difficult was it for you from somebody that had no sales experience

16:17.640 --> 16:19.720
jumping in and trying to do sales?

16:20.360 --> 16:23.960
The first couple were definitely a little bit uncomfortable, I would say.

16:23.960 --> 16:27.320
I think I remember I answered the first one,

16:27.320 --> 16:30.600
or I called the first business owner and I think I totally,

16:31.240 --> 16:33.560
like diarrhea, the mouth, just everything.

16:33.560 --> 16:34.920
He asked me a question, I answered it.

16:34.920 --> 16:36.520
So they definitely go smooth,

16:36.520 --> 16:40.840
but it definitely helps when you have a structure that's laid out for you,

16:40.840 --> 16:44.040
something that you can follow and have a process.

16:44.040 --> 16:47.640
But I mean, it definitely was a lot easier than I had anticipated.

16:48.360 --> 16:52.360
I always tell people the business model is very simple, but it's not easy.

16:52.360 --> 16:53.800
It still requires work.

16:53.800 --> 16:55.800
It's not going to be like this quick, easy cash,

16:55.800 --> 16:58.120
but it's a lot easier in a lot of things.

16:58.920 --> 17:00.040
Okay, let's keep going.

17:00.040 --> 17:02.360
I like what you said.

17:03.480 --> 17:05.080
The first time you do anything, you suck.

17:05.080 --> 17:08.680
I mean, whether it be bake a cake or paint a billboard, whatever you do,

17:09.560 --> 17:11.720
the first time you do anything, it's not your best one.

17:11.720 --> 17:14.200
I mean, the first time, I'm sure Nick, you did a live.

17:14.760 --> 17:19.480
Look at your lives and your content and your courses now versus your very first one.

17:19.480 --> 17:22.920
I mean, whatever it is, your first one is never your best,

17:22.920 --> 17:24.520
but you got to start somewhere.

17:24.520 --> 17:25.720
Yeah, great point.

17:26.360 --> 17:27.000
Really good point.

17:27.720 --> 17:29.640
Okay, so this is a question.

17:29.640 --> 17:31.160
I'm not looking for any specific answer.

17:31.160 --> 17:34.360
I legitimately want to know because I remember for me how it felt,

17:34.360 --> 17:38.040
but from comparing it to when you were at zero,

17:38.040 --> 17:39.960
you're starting this business, you're cutting your teeth,

17:39.960 --> 17:42.200
you're not really sure what you're doing.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.680
I'm going to ask you and then Porter.

17:44.680 --> 17:46.360
Stephanie, you're making 8,600 bucks a month.

17:46.360 --> 17:49.880
Obviously, that's top line, but how does it feel knowing,

17:49.880 --> 17:53.400
hey, this actually works and I can do this and the sky's the limit?

17:53.960 --> 17:55.160
Does that get you excited?

17:55.160 --> 17:57.400
Does that get you overwhelmed?

17:57.400 --> 17:59.960
Does it make you anxious that you should be doing more?

17:59.960 --> 18:04.920
How do you feel knowing, hey, I've made it 8,600 a month, but how do you feel?

18:07.560 --> 18:09.480
I think like you said in a lot of your videos,

18:09.480 --> 18:11.480
you just got to get one already, you're built.

18:11.480 --> 18:16.920
And then even after I did one, I kind of laughed because I watched so many of your videos.

18:16.920 --> 18:18.040
I mean, so many.

18:18.040 --> 18:21.640
I mean, literally, no offense, I kind of got sick of watching you.

18:23.640 --> 18:26.360
I was like, oh, and it got to the point where like,

18:26.360 --> 18:28.840
oh, is it like blonde Nick or is it brown Nick?

18:28.840 --> 18:30.440
Is it bearded Nick or is it not Nick?

18:30.440 --> 18:33.880
I'm like, but I mean, I watched tons and tons of content

18:33.880 --> 18:40.200
and just to really get it dialed in while I was going through your content

18:40.200 --> 18:41.080
and getting going.

18:41.720 --> 18:43.240
And I believed everything you said.

18:43.240 --> 18:45.000
I didn't think you were just blowing smoke,

18:45.000 --> 18:47.400
but you know, and I was like, oh yeah, I want to feel that too.

18:47.400 --> 18:52.520
And even though I did one, I still even, not that I had,

18:53.160 --> 18:55.000
I'm like, okay, I knew I could do it before.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.600
And then after I did it, I knew I could do it.

18:58.280 --> 19:02.440
But then I knew that, okay, now you just go do more.

19:03.400 --> 19:06.600
And again, like my first one wasn't the best.

19:06.680 --> 19:12.040
I now was debriefing or troubleshooting the things I did wrong in the first one.

19:12.040 --> 19:12.920
And you just get better.

19:12.920 --> 19:15.080
You tweak it and you find out what works for you.

19:15.080 --> 19:16.120
So was it overwhelming?

19:16.120 --> 19:16.600
No.

19:16.600 --> 19:17.560
Do I feel like I should be working?

19:18.440 --> 19:20.360
I think every single person in your bit,

19:20.360 --> 19:23.640
what I love about this business is every single person can do their version of it.

19:24.680 --> 19:27.640
Because you do have a lot of people who are doing like, I'm not one of them,

19:27.640 --> 19:29.880
but I know like you asked the other day in the group, you're like,

19:29.880 --> 19:33.240
who's still doing a nine to five and then it's slamming deals on the side.

19:33.240 --> 19:33.960
I'm not doing it.

19:34.920 --> 19:36.440
This is all I do full time.

19:36.440 --> 19:39.080
I knew for me, like this is the bandwidth that I had.

19:39.080 --> 19:41.960
And where I am in my life, I needed to do this full time.

19:42.600 --> 19:44.680
So I just wanted to speed it up.

19:44.680 --> 19:46.360
But that's not right for everybody.

19:46.360 --> 19:47.960
But everybody can do it.

19:47.960 --> 19:51.160
I think the important thing though is for people who are going to do it on the side,

19:51.160 --> 19:53.640
because like, you know, I know you're a blind guy.

19:53.640 --> 19:55.880
People who don't speak English is a first language guy.

19:55.880 --> 19:59.320
You have like, you know, you're a guy with people with kids and this and that.

19:59.320 --> 20:00.440
Can anybody do it?

20:00.440 --> 20:01.080
Absolutely.

20:01.880 --> 20:04.440
Is it more difficult with all those other things on your plate?

20:05.000 --> 20:05.500
Yeah.

20:06.060 --> 20:07.180
But is it undoable?

20:07.180 --> 20:07.820
No.

20:07.820 --> 20:13.020
So it's just a matter of keeping your priorities straight and that's it.

20:13.020 --> 20:17.340
And so all I did was reverse engineered where I wanted to be.

20:17.340 --> 20:20.380
Like when you bring people in, the first thing you have us do,

20:20.380 --> 20:23.100
and once we get into your paid group, is to do our map.

20:23.100 --> 20:24.620
You just got to do your map.

20:24.620 --> 20:26.620
And I call the map the reverse engineer.

20:26.620 --> 20:27.580
It's like, okay, where do you want to be?

20:28.300 --> 20:32.220
Okay, well, if you know where you want to be, then now it's like that's the end.

20:32.220 --> 20:34.220
Like if you put on Google Maps, like that's the end point.

20:34.220 --> 20:35.580
But you know where you are now.

20:35.580 --> 20:39.260
Now you got to reverse engineer it and work backwards and put in all the steps.

20:39.260 --> 20:40.620
Because that's what people get overwhelmed.

20:40.620 --> 20:44.300
Like, I mean, okay, I think most people do, but I mean, I could say I do.

20:44.300 --> 20:46.780
And the way to not get overwhelmed is that old adage, you know,

20:46.780 --> 20:48.700
like how do you eat an elephant one bite at a time?

20:48.700 --> 20:53.420
So you break it down into baby steps and, you know, you check stuff off and you feel good.

20:53.420 --> 20:56.300
And then, you know, just landing your first deal is like checking a big step off.

20:56.300 --> 20:57.660
I mean, it feels really good.

20:57.660 --> 20:59.820
You know, and then you just go to the next one and, you know,

20:59.820 --> 21:01.420
and you just keep on moving, get momentum.

21:02.380 --> 21:02.700
Yeah.

21:02.700 --> 21:03.980
No, I really like that.

21:04.300 --> 21:08.780
I still remember, guys, my very first deal that I remember the first dollar I made online.

21:08.780 --> 21:11.580
And I remember the first pre-sale deal that I did.

21:11.580 --> 21:12.620
It was back in 2020.

21:12.620 --> 21:14.140
I'm not going to tell you guys the whole story.

21:14.140 --> 21:17.340
And by the way, Ford, I'm coming to ask you how you fell in your first deal.

21:17.340 --> 21:18.940
So zip your lip for a second, bud.

21:18.940 --> 21:19.500
No, I'm just kidding.

21:20.620 --> 21:21.660
I'm going to ask him.

21:21.660 --> 21:22.380
I'm going to ask him.

21:22.380 --> 21:23.020
Don't worry.

21:23.020 --> 21:25.420
But I remember it was like this idea.

21:25.420 --> 21:26.620
I think we can pre-sell.

21:26.620 --> 21:27.660
I don't know if we can.

21:28.380 --> 21:29.980
And we did a test.

21:29.980 --> 21:30.940
We had a site.

21:30.940 --> 21:33.180
Actually, at this time, I was still building organically first.

21:33.180 --> 21:36.780
I had a site that was generating a couple of leads, ran some ads to it,

21:36.780 --> 21:40.380
did kind of a version of my process that I teach now, but it wasn't perfect.

21:40.380 --> 21:45.260
I got in the closing call and it was the easiest close I ever did.

21:45.260 --> 21:47.820
And I remember getting off holding the credit card digits.

21:47.820 --> 21:48.940
I wasn't even expecting the deal.

21:48.940 --> 21:50.540
I had to write down the credit card or the piece of paper.

21:50.540 --> 21:53.100
And I was like, first of all, I was shocked.

21:53.100 --> 21:54.700
Second of all, I ran the card.

21:54.700 --> 21:57.340
And then all of a sudden, my mind was like just blown.

21:57.340 --> 22:01.340
I'm like, oh my gosh, I could make any amount of money possible

22:01.340 --> 22:03.980
because now I can do this without waiting for it to rank.

22:03.980 --> 22:05.340
It was like, it just clicked.

22:05.340 --> 22:07.660
And I was like, okay, this is the key.

22:07.660 --> 22:11.420
This is that one missing piece that I think the model was missing.

22:11.420 --> 22:15.900
So, Porter, without further ado, since Ford's raised his hand in his own way,

22:15.900 --> 22:17.420
wanting to tell us how did you feel?

22:18.060 --> 22:21.900
How do you feel at 10,600 bucks a month never having run your own business,

22:21.900 --> 22:24.780
never having really worked any other job besides on the farm,

22:24.780 --> 22:28.140
and now you're renting simple websites to local business owners

22:28.140 --> 22:31.580
and basically doing sales to do that without having any experience?

22:31.580 --> 22:32.140
How did that feel?

22:33.100 --> 22:36.380
It honestly gives you a lot of confidence.

22:36.380 --> 22:40.060
It's like knowing that I can still do this while doing something that I love.

22:40.060 --> 22:44.060
So if anything, it's allowed me to be more confident in myself

22:44.060 --> 22:49.260
that I can support a family, myself, go and do and be who I want to be

22:49.260 --> 22:53.660
without having to do a nine to five or work some other job.

22:53.660 --> 22:54.300
You know what I'm saying?

22:54.300 --> 22:57.100
Like it's a weird thing, but it's like a mental thing too.

22:57.500 --> 22:58.620
The money is great.

22:58.620 --> 23:01.740
But what it does to be able to know that you can always make more money

23:01.740 --> 23:05.660
and that the sky's the limit, it makes you want to always do more

23:05.660 --> 23:07.660
because you're around people that are doing so much more than you.

23:07.660 --> 23:09.100
But dude, it's the greatest feeling.

23:10.620 --> 23:11.820
Gives you a ton of confidence.

23:11.820 --> 23:15.260
I've seen the thing I love most is when I see people that start at zero

23:15.260 --> 23:19.580
and then I see them when they made their first deal or 5K, 10K,

23:19.580 --> 23:21.020
is their confidence is night and day.

23:21.020 --> 23:21.900
And that's really fun for me.

23:21.900 --> 23:22.700
So, okay, let's keep going.

23:23.260 --> 23:26.140
Stephanie, was there a moment or time that you almost gave up

23:26.140 --> 23:27.500
or thought about quitting?

23:27.500 --> 23:28.380
Be honest.

23:28.380 --> 23:29.740
And if so, how'd you get through?

23:32.220 --> 23:34.700
I never thought about quitting because I didn't get myself an out.

23:35.500 --> 23:38.540
I assumed that was going to be your answer, by the way.

23:39.180 --> 23:40.060
But I keep going.

23:40.060 --> 23:40.940
I want to hear the rest of it.

23:42.460 --> 23:44.140
But I will tell you, did I scream?

23:44.140 --> 23:44.780
Did I yell?

23:44.780 --> 23:45.820
Did I cry?

23:45.820 --> 23:47.580
Did I have sleepless nights?

23:47.580 --> 23:52.460
Did I want to freaking punch like you and other people?

23:52.460 --> 23:52.960
Absolutely.

23:52.960 --> 23:55.840
The nearest baby.

23:59.600 --> 24:01.680
Believe me, it's not all a bed of roses.

24:01.680 --> 24:02.880
It's like, oh, golf's easy.

24:03.440 --> 24:06.560
All you do is you just hit this ball in this little hole.

24:08.560 --> 24:09.520
I have a friend who's a big...

24:09.520 --> 24:10.480
I know you play golf, Nick.

24:10.480 --> 24:11.680
I have a friend who plays golf.

24:12.320 --> 24:13.920
He never swears.

24:13.920 --> 24:14.880
Never, ever swears.

24:14.880 --> 24:16.880
He's the most mild-mannered guy.

24:17.600 --> 24:19.280
And I'd be like, hey, Mike, how's it going?

24:19.280 --> 24:20.880
I'm like, hey, how was golf today?

24:20.880 --> 24:22.560
And he's like, F golf.

24:22.960 --> 24:24.160
Literally, he was like, golf.

24:24.160 --> 24:26.560
That's the only time he swears is when he talks about golf.

24:26.560 --> 24:28.960
So it's simple, but it's not easy.

24:30.640 --> 24:31.600
How did I get through it?

24:32.960 --> 24:34.400
I literally said...

24:37.040 --> 24:38.480
And it was actually somebody in your group.

24:38.480 --> 24:41.600
I think it was Levi that was helping me, and I was talking to him.

24:41.600 --> 24:44.240
And Levi's one of your students down in Australia.

24:44.240 --> 24:48.480
I was like, Levi, this freaking dude Dylan's just like, volume this.

24:48.480 --> 24:49.360
I'm like, God damn it.

24:49.360 --> 24:50.240
I'm like, man goes this.

24:50.960 --> 24:53.120
I'm like, in some rush, assholes and blah, blah, blah.

24:53.120 --> 24:54.960
I get like, dude, I'm not afraid.

24:55.760 --> 24:56.880
I know I might sound like a sailor.

24:56.880 --> 24:57.920
I'm like, God damn it.

24:57.920 --> 24:59.520
I'm like, what the heck?

24:59.520 --> 25:02.880
And then at the end of the day, he was like, he's like...

25:04.160 --> 25:06.960
It was because he literally said to me, he's like, you know what, Stephanie?

25:06.960 --> 25:12.400
He's like, he said, and I was worried about going into cities

25:12.400 --> 25:14.400
where there were other lead gen people.

25:14.400 --> 25:16.240
And he's like, look, he's like, I'm not afraid of that.

25:16.240 --> 25:17.360
I'm like, really?

25:17.360 --> 25:18.080
Why?

25:18.080 --> 25:20.400
And he said, because I know I can outlive him.

25:22.800 --> 25:26.560
I have the strength and fortitude and acuity and knowledge and everything.

25:26.560 --> 25:27.520
He's like, I'm not afraid of them.

25:28.160 --> 25:29.680
And I went, huh.

25:30.400 --> 25:33.520
I mean, granted, he has years experience than I did.

25:34.160 --> 25:36.400
But I went, oh, okay.

25:36.400 --> 25:37.520
Well, I'm like, well, that makes sense.

25:38.560 --> 25:41.280
And then I can't answer this.

25:41.280 --> 25:47.120
I don't know what happened, Nick, but I swear to you that what happened was

25:47.120 --> 25:48.960
I just had an aha moment.

25:48.960 --> 25:50.960
And I don't know whether it was from one of your videos,

25:52.000 --> 25:56.160
like where you actually said it or whether or not I got the feeling.

25:56.160 --> 25:57.680
I don't know exactly when it happened.

25:58.720 --> 26:03.360
But I had this feeling, this thought, and then I had the feeling.

26:03.360 --> 26:05.680
I'm like, I don't know how I'm going to make this work.

26:06.400 --> 26:07.360
I just know it's going to work.

26:08.720 --> 26:09.840
And that was it.

26:09.840 --> 26:11.520
And then I never deviated from that.

26:12.240 --> 26:15.040
So no matter what, I'm like, okay.

26:15.920 --> 26:18.480
What I did last week and last month, that isn't working.

26:18.480 --> 26:21.600
And I'm like, I make changes a lot.

26:21.600 --> 26:24.960
And I made changes this week and big changes.

26:24.960 --> 26:27.280
And I'll talk to you about them in a little bit if you want.

26:27.280 --> 26:30.720
But I mean, I'm constantly reevaluating and assessing

26:30.720 --> 26:34.400
because all I feel is like when I'm doing things that aren't working, that's data.

26:34.400 --> 26:37.520
And then I'm like, if I'm doing stuff that I know isn't working, then stop it.

26:38.480 --> 26:39.600
Yeah, that's it.

26:40.160 --> 26:40.880
I like that.

26:40.880 --> 26:43.040
Yeah, I don't even have anything to add.

26:43.280 --> 26:46.080
I could say something, but it would be the exact same thing that you said in my own way.

26:46.080 --> 26:47.280
So let's just leave it and move on.

26:48.480 --> 26:51.840
Next question I have, and this is going to be specifically for you, Stephanie,

26:51.840 --> 26:56.080
is why did you decide to start pre-selling

26:56.080 --> 26:59.440
versus just waiting for websites to rank due in the traditional way?

27:00.480 --> 27:01.200
I'm impatient.

27:01.200 --> 27:02.000
I'm not willing to wait.

27:03.680 --> 27:07.840
Again, I think the organic way is a great play.

27:07.840 --> 27:10.400
I think it's super for the right person who's patient

27:10.800 --> 27:14.720
and a person who loves to be sitting behind the computer and loves doing more of the

27:15.440 --> 27:18.480
SEO and the ranking and this and that and wants to just like,

27:19.440 --> 27:20.640
they're the pressure cooker people.

27:20.640 --> 27:22.000
Oh, let me set it and forget it.

27:22.800 --> 27:24.160
No, I want it now.

27:25.360 --> 27:26.000
I want it now.

27:26.960 --> 27:28.560
I want the microwave version.

27:28.560 --> 27:29.120
Air fryer.

27:29.120 --> 27:29.840
I want it now.

27:29.840 --> 27:30.480
I don't have time.

27:31.520 --> 27:32.400
It's like in or out.

27:33.040 --> 27:36.320
I tell people I'm like, this is not rocket science.

27:36.800 --> 27:37.520
We are not building.

27:38.400 --> 27:40.800
I'm not a brain surgeon and you are not a rocket scientist.

27:41.600 --> 27:42.400
I laid it out.

27:42.400 --> 27:43.520
This is what it is.

27:43.520 --> 27:44.480
That's why I don't do any of those.

27:44.880 --> 27:45.680
I call them TOs.

27:45.680 --> 27:46.720
No thinking over.

27:46.720 --> 27:47.840
None of that bizzo.

27:48.400 --> 27:49.920
I'm like, dude, you know it.

27:49.920 --> 27:50.880
You know right now.

27:52.240 --> 27:53.280
I don't hit them this hard.

27:53.920 --> 27:56.880
But I will say this about whoever's watching, by the way,

27:56.880 --> 27:59.360
I want to back up and I do want to share this

27:59.360 --> 28:00.880
because I know I sound like a royal.

28:02.240 --> 28:04.320
I know I come across strong now,

28:04.320 --> 28:06.560
but I will tell you when I on the other side,

28:06.560 --> 28:08.560
when I first saw your videos, Nick,

28:08.560 --> 28:11.680
like I had seen your stuff and when I first

28:11.680 --> 28:13.760
was just learning about the rank and rent industry

28:13.760 --> 28:14.800
because I didn't know about it,

28:15.520 --> 28:17.200
I knew I wanted to work online.

28:17.200 --> 28:19.600
I just didn't know in what venue

28:19.600 --> 28:22.960
because I knew I had to do something that was online

28:22.960 --> 28:25.440
and I really wanted something that had recurring revenue.

28:25.440 --> 28:29.520
And so for a hot minute, I was doing credit card sales,

28:29.520 --> 28:31.760
merchant services, because that has residuals.

28:32.480 --> 28:34.240
I didn't want to do insurance that has residuals.

28:34.240 --> 28:36.160
I didn't want to be a stockbroker.

28:36.160 --> 28:37.280
Like I hate the stock.

28:37.280 --> 28:37.840
I hate the market.

28:38.480 --> 28:40.560
I didn't want to get licensed in series seven, blah, blah, blah.

28:41.840 --> 28:43.040
I didn't want to go that route.

28:43.040 --> 28:45.440
But I wanted to have something where there was recurring revenue.

28:45.440 --> 28:46.720
I don't want to sell high ticket sales

28:46.720 --> 28:49.200
because those are one hit wonders.

28:49.200 --> 28:50.720
I don't want to be like one and then done.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.320
So this really ticked on my boxes.

28:55.520 --> 28:57.440
But when I first looked at your stuff,

28:57.440 --> 28:59.360
I mean, I saw all your stuff

28:59.840 --> 29:03.520
and with your strong personality, I was a little taken back.

29:03.520 --> 29:05.120
And I knew who you were.

29:05.120 --> 29:06.080
I saw you.

29:06.080 --> 29:07.600
I'm like, wow, this kid's intense.

29:11.120 --> 29:12.240
Everybody has their own process.

29:12.240 --> 29:13.360
It took me a while to warm up.

29:13.360 --> 29:16.080
And I'm like, it wasn't until I got in and learned the model.

29:17.280 --> 29:19.440
And then I watched, there's that guy, what's his name?

29:19.440 --> 29:21.680
Like James Dooley, like the guy over in the UK.

29:21.680 --> 29:22.880
Like I was watching all his, do you know him?

29:22.880 --> 29:25.120
Yeah, I don't know him personally, but I've heard the name, yeah.

29:25.120 --> 29:25.600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:25.600 --> 29:30.240
So basically he's like just crushing it in the UK.

29:30.240 --> 29:34.560
Like he's like his own age refs, whatever.

29:34.560 --> 29:35.520
He's like crushing it over there.

29:35.520 --> 29:38.800
But I'm like, you know, and I was like, wow, you know,

29:38.800 --> 29:41.440
like so many people from all different walks of life are killing it.

29:41.440 --> 29:44.160
And I'm like, oh, it all makes sense.

29:44.160 --> 29:47.360
And every single person in my real life,

29:47.360 --> 29:48.800
you know, my family and friends,

29:48.800 --> 29:51.440
when I would tell them about this industry,

29:52.160 --> 29:54.560
they were like, I'm like, A, did you ever hear about it?

29:54.560 --> 29:57.440
No, it's not saturated.

29:57.440 --> 30:00.240
I'm like, but B, I'm like, does that make sense to you?

30:00.240 --> 30:02.240
They're like, yeah, that actually makes a lot of sense.

30:03.120 --> 30:09.520
So then fast forward, then, you know, I just got to the point where

30:09.520 --> 30:12.240
I knew this was no matter what, it was going to work.

30:12.240 --> 30:13.120
I didn't know how.

30:13.120 --> 30:15.760
It's like a combination of the same, you know, it's like squid games.

30:15.760 --> 30:18.560
Like, you know, like you don't know which combination is going to work.

30:18.560 --> 30:19.600
I just knew it was going to work.

30:20.400 --> 30:21.520
I didn't know how long it was going to take.

30:21.520 --> 30:23.360
It was a matter of if, it was a matter of when.

30:25.040 --> 30:26.720
Yeah, yeah, I like that a lot.

30:27.760 --> 30:32.720
For me, in 2020, 2019, I was still doing the business.

30:32.720 --> 30:34.720
I was having mediocre success.

30:34.720 --> 30:37.360
I was still doing it the old fashioned way, the right then rent.

30:37.920 --> 30:41.040
And, but in the back of my mind, it was still,

30:41.040 --> 30:43.200
I was kind of like looking for like,

30:43.200 --> 30:45.680
if there was a better opportunity, I was ready to jump.

30:45.680 --> 30:46.320
You were a lurker.

30:46.320 --> 30:47.520
You were lurking around.

30:47.520 --> 30:49.520
I was a lurker, a dabbler.

30:49.520 --> 30:50.480
I was half pregnant.

30:50.480 --> 30:52.720
Peeping Tom, Peeping Nick, Peeping Nick.

30:53.200 --> 30:56.160
I was, I had the wandering eye, right?

30:56.160 --> 31:02.160
And finally in 2020, I was like, okay, I, you know,

31:02.160 --> 31:03.440
I've got to take care of my family.

31:03.440 --> 31:07.120
I've got to, I'm getting, I thought I'd be a millionaire at 30

31:07.120 --> 31:10.560
and it's, I'm 29 and anyway, I started writing down.

31:10.560 --> 31:12.800
I'm like, okay, I need to make this kind of money.

31:12.800 --> 31:16.880
And I realized I had the right business model, like right inside my, in my hands.

31:16.880 --> 31:19.520
I realized that there was a couple of things that I felt like were broken.

31:19.520 --> 31:21.280
For example, having to wait six months on stuff.

31:21.280 --> 31:22.560
But I knew the model was right.

31:23.280 --> 31:27.200
And I just, I made up my mind and I was like, I'm going to do this mentally.

31:27.200 --> 31:29.040
I'm going to do this until it works.

31:29.040 --> 31:30.400
Like, I don't care if that's 10 years.

31:30.400 --> 31:32.000
I don't care if that's 15 years.

31:32.000 --> 31:32.960
I'm done.

31:32.960 --> 31:35.520
Basically I married the model, done and done.

31:35.520 --> 31:38.160
I was no longer dating and I didn't have any side chicks.

31:38.160 --> 31:39.760
It was like, I married the model.

31:39.760 --> 31:42.320
And as soon as I did that eight months later, I was making a hundred grand a month.

31:42.320 --> 31:43.840
Now it wasn't overnight.

31:44.560 --> 31:45.440
I worked my butt off.

31:45.440 --> 31:46.480
I did the pre-selling.

31:46.480 --> 31:48.640
I made this mistake and that mistake.

31:48.640 --> 31:50.640
But to your point, which I've heard you say a couple of times,

31:50.640 --> 31:52.560
and I want to make sure everyone understands is like, that's it.

31:52.560 --> 31:54.320
As soon as you decide, hey, this is it.

31:54.320 --> 31:55.440
This is what I'm going to make work.

31:57.040 --> 32:00.960
Imagine Stephanie and Porter, if there was either nine to five,

32:00.960 --> 32:02.560
whatever nine to five you wanted.

32:02.560 --> 32:03.920
And then there was this.

32:03.920 --> 32:05.360
There was no drop shipping.

32:05.360 --> 32:06.720
There was no Etsy shop.

32:06.720 --> 32:07.920
There was no FBA.

32:07.920 --> 32:09.600
Do you know how many more people would be successful at this?

32:09.600 --> 32:11.120
Because it would be the only option.

32:12.000 --> 32:12.640
Right?

32:12.640 --> 32:13.200
But the problem-

32:13.200 --> 32:13.760
You want to kick your butt?

32:13.760 --> 32:14.960
Yeah, you want to kick your butt in gear?

32:14.960 --> 32:16.720
Like, like, like anytime.

32:16.720 --> 32:18.480
Like I'm not, look, I'm never going back nine up.

32:18.480 --> 32:20.240
Like, I mean, it's not for me.

32:20.720 --> 32:24.400
But once in a blue moon, I have to get in my car and go travel.

32:24.400 --> 32:27.840
Like, and then I'm stuck in rush hour traffic and I'm like, oh, you know,

32:27.840 --> 32:31.440
like just being stuck in my car, like in that rat race, you know,

32:31.440 --> 32:32.240
whatever you hate about it.

32:32.240 --> 32:34.320
You're like, look, I don't hate Mondays anymore.

32:34.320 --> 32:36.960
You know, like it's been a long time since I hated Mondays.

32:36.960 --> 32:39.280
But I mean, you know, no more hating Mondays,

32:39.280 --> 32:43.280
no more dealing with some boss who's an idiot that knows less than you.

32:43.280 --> 32:45.920
You know, it's like no more times are you going to get told like,

32:45.920 --> 32:48.560
oh, by the way, we're going to have your quarterly review.

32:48.640 --> 32:55.200
Look, by the way, like when I, when I got hired for that job that I was doing,

32:55.200 --> 33:01.280
for that nonprofit, my supervisor that was interviewing me told me six months later.

33:02.400 --> 33:07.200
So six months after I got the job, we were at the Christmas party

33:07.200 --> 33:10.160
and she pulled me aside and she's like, Stephanie, I have something to tell you.

33:10.720 --> 33:11.840
I'm like, what's that Christie?

33:11.840 --> 33:13.920
She's like, when I was interviewing you,

33:15.280 --> 33:18.000
I almost didn't extend you an offer and hire you.

33:18.000 --> 33:18.800
And I'm like, why is that?

33:18.800 --> 33:21.360
She goes, I was afraid of you.

33:21.360 --> 33:22.160
And I'm like, why is that?

33:22.160 --> 33:26.160
She's like, because I figured like you'd have my job in three months.

33:26.160 --> 33:28.880
And I'm like, well, I didn't want your job.

33:28.880 --> 33:32.000
But yeah, thanks for the compliment.

33:32.000 --> 33:32.720
I was over.

33:32.720 --> 33:33.520
I wasn't qualified.

33:33.520 --> 33:36.640
And I did have to like, I had a downplay because I was,

33:36.640 --> 33:37.840
because I had a headhunting background.

33:37.840 --> 33:40.720
I knew how to like sell myself to get the job, which I did have to downplay.

33:40.720 --> 33:43.360
But from the day I started that job, Nick,

33:43.360 --> 33:46.960
I knew I was either getting fired or I was going to get promoted.

33:48.720 --> 33:51.360
And there was actually one job I wanted,

33:51.360 --> 33:53.360
and it was going to be online and office based.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.520
And they only wanted me in the field.

33:55.520 --> 33:56.880
And I was like, not going to happen.

33:57.840 --> 33:58.800
So I was like, bye.

34:02.080 --> 34:07.120
But yeah, I look like years ago, I used to have this like,

34:07.120 --> 34:09.360
I was doing like, my friends were like, you got to do a blog,

34:09.360 --> 34:11.040
you got to do a blog, you got to do Instagram, you got to do this,

34:11.040 --> 34:12.400
whatever social media, blah, blah, blah.

34:12.400 --> 34:15.040
And I'm like, okay, mine's called be the driver of your own car.

34:15.120 --> 34:18.240
Like, for those, because in my life, there have been times

34:18.240 --> 34:20.560
where like, my sister called me on it, friends have called me out.

34:20.560 --> 34:21.840
They're like, you're just going about your life.

34:21.840 --> 34:23.440
Like, they're like, when are you going to have kids?

34:23.440 --> 34:24.800
I'm like, I don't know when it happens.

34:24.800 --> 34:26.160
They're like, you got to make that decision.

34:26.160 --> 34:28.160
Like, look, I mean, this is years ago.

34:28.160 --> 34:33.040
But I realized I had a, like, it was a shock of reality.

34:33.040 --> 34:38.640
I was literally, my life was occurring and life was happening to me

34:38.640 --> 34:41.440
rather than me grabbing like the steering wheel of my life

34:41.440 --> 34:43.120
and freaking driving my life.

34:43.120 --> 34:44.560
I realized I was in the back seat.

34:45.040 --> 34:47.440
I realized I needed to get in the freaking front seat

34:47.440 --> 34:49.680
and make my own decisions and my own choices.

34:49.680 --> 34:53.040
And that's what this business, you know, allows anybody to do

34:53.040 --> 34:54.480
because you can call your own shots.

34:54.480 --> 34:56.560
You can make as much money or as little money as you want.

34:56.560 --> 34:58.080
You can do it full-time, you can do it part-time.

34:58.080 --> 35:00.640
I mean, look at Ryan Dalton, you know, like, look, he's killing it.

35:00.640 --> 35:03.280
You know, he's still working full-time and he, you know, any, and then he,

35:03.280 --> 35:05.680
and then he ramped up, he developed that whole platform.

35:06.560 --> 35:09.920
And he's like, you know, he's on, he's supercharged and other people are,

35:09.920 --> 35:12.560
you know, I know you have other people who are stay at home moms

35:12.560 --> 35:14.880
who've been in it and they're doing very well.

35:14.880 --> 35:17.280
And then, you know, you have, you have the entire continuum.

35:17.280 --> 35:21.920
There's no wrong way to do this business model except quitting.

35:22.800 --> 35:25.280
Yeah, very, very true.

35:26.080 --> 35:27.040
I want to ask both of you this.

35:27.040 --> 35:29.040
I'll start with Porter and then Stephanie.

35:29.040 --> 35:33.840
But what is one thing and I want you to think about the real answer.

35:33.840 --> 35:35.680
And don't just give me something that comes.

35:35.680 --> 35:36.720
I mean, maybe something comes to your head,

35:36.720 --> 35:38.720
but try to think about the main thing.

35:39.280 --> 35:43.440
But what is the one thing that you can blame on your success?

35:43.440 --> 35:46.800
Porter getting to 10-6, Stephanie getting to 8-6.

35:46.800 --> 35:47.760
Porter, I'll have you go first.

35:47.760 --> 35:50.800
What do you think is the number one thing that you can blame your success on?

35:56.960 --> 35:59.680
And by the way, it's okay to pause because if you've ever seen

36:00.640 --> 36:03.760
some of these guys, Elon Musk, wait to give an answer.

36:03.760 --> 36:05.520
He has a pause that's awkward enough.

36:05.520 --> 36:07.760
You almost think there's a glitch on the YouTube video.

36:09.120 --> 36:11.120
So take your time and Stephanie, if you want to go,

36:11.120 --> 36:12.640
if you have an answer already, you can go first.

36:13.440 --> 36:13.940
Okay.

36:20.800 --> 36:22.800
It goes back to what I was mentioning before.

36:22.800 --> 36:25.360
It's just there is no other option.

36:25.360 --> 36:26.480
There's no fork in the road.

36:27.200 --> 36:29.680
It's not a matter of if, it's just a matter of how.

36:29.680 --> 36:31.360
It's that constant belief.

36:32.080 --> 36:35.760
And I'll tell you, I don't know how I'm going to get there,

36:35.760 --> 36:37.520
but I'm going to freaking get there.

36:37.520 --> 36:42.480
And again, it's like, don't be afraid to try anything.

36:43.440 --> 36:44.240
Whatever you need.

36:44.240 --> 36:48.800
And I'll tell you, I realized that I was, I have, look,

36:48.800 --> 36:50.640
I have some very negative people in my family.

36:50.640 --> 36:51.680
They're my parents.

36:51.680 --> 36:54.400
And so I had to pull back from spending time with them.

36:55.280 --> 36:58.720
And I had to stop and I had to stop talking to people

36:58.720 --> 37:00.880
that don't understand the rank and rent business

37:02.640 --> 37:04.640
because it's very easy for them to go, oh,

37:04.640 --> 37:06.800
you've been in it for six months and you haven't made any money.

37:07.840 --> 37:09.360
Oh, you invested how much money?

37:09.360 --> 37:10.640
Oh, and you went down to New Orleans.

37:10.640 --> 37:11.920
Oh, and you bought how many websites?

37:11.920 --> 37:13.280
Oh, you know, like, I mean,

37:13.280 --> 37:14.160
I can go on and on and on.

37:14.160 --> 37:16.800
I'm like, dude, I don't need more negative Nellies.

37:16.800 --> 37:18.160
I don't need that in my life.

37:18.160 --> 37:20.480
I'm like, dude, check yourself at the door

37:20.480 --> 37:21.760
so that I just zip my mouth.

37:22.800 --> 37:25.040
It's like, I mean, I'm a big proponent.

37:25.040 --> 37:26.720
I'm a huge follower of Dan Martell.

37:27.440 --> 37:29.360
I love Hermosy and I love Dan Martell.

37:29.360 --> 37:31.680
I'm telling you, if you want to follow too,

37:31.680 --> 37:32.640
Nick, your stuff's great.

37:32.640 --> 37:35.920
These are generalists, like Hermosy and Martell.

37:35.920 --> 37:36.400
Fabulous.

37:36.400 --> 37:39.440
It's about mindset and about not getting sucked.

37:40.320 --> 37:44.160
It, you know, Martell actually was tap.

37:44.160 --> 37:45.280
He's a Canadian guy.

37:45.280 --> 37:48.240
And, you know, look him up, if you guys,

37:48.240 --> 37:50.640
if you don't know him, but amazing guy.

37:50.640 --> 37:53.520
And it was X number of years ago, he started making it big.

37:53.520 --> 37:55.920
He wrote a whole bunch of SaaS programs

37:55.920 --> 37:57.120
and this and that started killing it.

37:57.120 --> 37:59.200
Like he was doing stuff in Canada.

37:59.200 --> 38:01.040
And then one day he gets a call

38:01.040 --> 38:05.520
and Richard Brinson wanted him to come to his villa in Switzerland.

38:06.240 --> 38:08.240
And Martell was looking around like, who me?

38:08.960 --> 38:11.120
And next thing you know, Martell goes over to Switzerland

38:11.120 --> 38:12.080
with like nine other guys

38:12.080 --> 38:13.600
and they're hanging out with Sir Richard Branson.

38:14.400 --> 38:18.160
And he's, you know, he's having like all this imposter syndrome,

38:18.160 --> 38:21.280
you know, feeling like he's not worthy of being there.

38:22.400 --> 38:25.040
But he, I think it goes back to playing up

38:25.040 --> 38:27.760
and surrounding yourself with the people.

38:27.760 --> 38:30.640
And Porter, you made a great point about that earlier.

38:30.640 --> 38:33.680
It's about being around other people who are succeeding.

38:33.680 --> 38:35.840
You know, you have to play up in terms of like

38:35.840 --> 38:38.000
being around other guys or women

38:38.000 --> 38:39.680
that are doing better than you are.

38:39.680 --> 38:42.000
And not being around the people who are going to suck you down.

38:42.000 --> 38:48.080
It's very easy when someone is at their job

38:48.080 --> 38:50.960
and they're sour grapes and they hate their life,

38:50.960 --> 38:54.400
it's really easy for them to like poke a hole in what we're doing.

38:54.400 --> 38:56.720
Even if we have a modicum of success

38:56.720 --> 39:00.240
because it's natural human tendency that they have that

39:00.960 --> 39:03.200
it's not that those are bad people.

39:03.200 --> 39:05.280
It's just like, you know, when Britney Spears,

39:05.280 --> 39:07.840
like, you know, like has problems on the news

39:07.840 --> 39:09.520
or Janet Jackson flashes her boob or whatever,

39:09.520 --> 39:11.600
like all of a sudden, like, oh, people love scandal.

39:12.320 --> 39:15.680
People in general want to, like they want to hate on other people

39:15.680 --> 39:17.360
because they don't feel good about themselves.

39:18.240 --> 39:22.320
And so I had to make sure that I kept all that negative stuff out

39:24.480 --> 39:29.520
and I would listen to YouTube videos every night, just audio.

39:29.520 --> 39:34.080
I would stick it underneath my pillow of positive mindset stuff.

39:34.960 --> 39:36.000
And related to money.

39:36.960 --> 39:38.000
So like you guys can YouTube,

39:38.000 --> 39:39.920
but like, I mean, there's YouTube videos for everything,

39:39.920 --> 39:40.800
but it's just audio.

39:40.800 --> 39:42.640
It's, you know, it's not, it's nothing visual.

39:42.640 --> 39:47.200
It's just about, it's really about the positive, the auto suggestion.

39:47.840 --> 39:51.840
And literally whatever you think about will come about.

39:51.840 --> 39:54.960
And if you're worried, it's the, it's the power of,

39:54.960 --> 39:58.400
it's the mindset of abundancy versus the mindset of scarcity.

39:59.440 --> 40:01.040
And I will tell you one last thing.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.960
A year ago, like after I stopped working at that nonprofit,

40:04.960 --> 40:08.080
like I took like six or nine months off and I wasn't making any money.

40:08.080 --> 40:10.400
So like, just for like, just for like kicks and giggles,

40:10.400 --> 40:11.600
I started selling plasma.

40:13.040 --> 40:14.960
And I'd be like in the plasma selling thing,

40:14.960 --> 40:16.960
like they're like looking around, like going like,

40:16.960 --> 40:18.160
like I'd be there in the middle of the day.

40:18.160 --> 40:20.560
And I'm like looking around and you can tell, you just tell these people,

40:20.560 --> 40:22.560
like most of these people don't have jobs.

40:23.360 --> 40:26.320
And I'm like, and all of a sudden I went one day, I'm like, what Stephanie,

40:26.320 --> 40:27.440
I'm like, what the hell are you doing?

40:28.160 --> 40:29.600
Frickin stop selling plasma.

40:30.320 --> 40:32.320
Like you, you got to get out of this like negative,

40:32.320 --> 40:36.480
like you're like a poor broke, you know, person you've sell plasma.

40:36.480 --> 40:38.480
And like, like, could I have used the money?

40:38.480 --> 40:41.360
Yeah, because I was reading my say, like my, you know,

40:41.360 --> 40:44.240
we talk about leaky buckets, you know, like, like my bucket was leaking a lot

40:44.240 --> 40:45.680
because I didn't have anything going in the bucket.

40:45.680 --> 40:47.840
It was leaking because I was investing in this business.

40:48.400 --> 40:50.320
But I said, look, I said, I had to pull the plug.

40:50.320 --> 40:53.040
I'm like, I like, you know, because 50 bucks here, 100 bucks there.

40:53.040 --> 40:54.080
That was great.

40:54.160 --> 41:00.800
But it was conceptually, I needed to stop that negative scarcity mindset

41:00.800 --> 41:05.360
and go full in to be around people like you, Porter and you, Nick,

41:05.360 --> 41:08.000
and everybody else in your group to be like around people

41:08.000 --> 41:09.680
and thinking like, I'm going to crush it.

41:09.680 --> 41:11.200
They're crushing it. There's no reason I can't.

41:12.800 --> 41:16.800
I love that. So yeah, I agree making the decision.

41:16.800 --> 41:20.720
There's no other option. It sounds cliche, but it's a huge thing.

41:20.720 --> 41:22.720
That's burn the bridge, burn the bridge,

41:23.280 --> 41:25.920
burn the ship there, all the different ways of saying it's very, very true.

41:25.920 --> 41:26.720
Porter, what about you?

41:28.720 --> 41:33.200
I would say at the beginning, I think when people would post their deals,

41:33.200 --> 41:35.040
it would kind of make me mad. I would be like, gosh dang,

41:35.040 --> 41:38.640
like this person's landing deals and I've been in this how much longer

41:38.640 --> 41:42.960
or I have more resources. Like it was almost a chip on my shoulder.

41:42.960 --> 41:45.200
And I remember one time I was doing some 10 K coaching.

41:45.200 --> 41:48.720
I remember one guy was like, how is he supposed to, you know, coach me

41:48.720 --> 41:51.760
on if he's not even at 10 K. And so a part of it was just like proving

41:51.760 --> 41:53.680
other people wrong, which is probably the bad way to do it.

41:53.680 --> 41:57.200
But just like, Hey, I'm from a small town. I'm a farmer.

41:57.200 --> 42:01.200
Like I can, I can do just as good as someone that has this much knowledge.

42:01.840 --> 42:05.200
You know, so I think a lot of it has to do with like the chip on my shoulder.

42:05.200 --> 42:08.560
But I also would say just the people that I'm around, like I didn't even

42:08.560 --> 42:12.080
believe that there was that much money to be made until I was in this group.

42:12.080 --> 42:16.000
And I was like, Oh my gosh, like I'm, I'm this little fish in this big world.

42:16.000 --> 42:19.920
And like, why, why shouldn't I work harder? Like if I work harder, I can achieve that.

42:20.560 --> 42:22.160
So that's what kind of drove me.

42:22.160 --> 42:24.960
And that's what it continues to drive me is just seeing other people's success

42:24.960 --> 42:27.600
and like, why not me? Yeah, I love that.

42:28.400 --> 42:32.400
It's true guys. And that's, that's, that's a great thing about this group.

42:32.400 --> 42:36.640
There's some really, really successful people in, and by the way, that's a great,

42:36.640 --> 42:40.400
thanks for your answer, but in this group, not only in, in the rank and rent,

42:40.400 --> 42:44.800
but like one thing I've noticed I really love about this group is everyone's from,

42:44.800 --> 42:48.400
like comes this group already being really successful in the thing that they were doing,

42:48.400 --> 42:52.640
just knowing or realizing at some point that it's not the avenue and the vehicle

42:52.640 --> 42:55.040
they want to use because they want freedom and they want to have, you know,

42:55.040 --> 42:56.960
time freedom, location freedom, financial freedom.

42:57.680 --> 43:02.160
So make sure you guys are, you know, what I, one thing I would say in groups like this,

43:03.120 --> 43:08.560
I have my own groups, I've been in groups, but if you will be somebody that's always looking

43:08.560 --> 43:13.440
to add value and be a producer, not a consumer, not just one of these leeches, not one of these

43:13.440 --> 43:18.240
freaking just try to suck as much information and hide in the shadows, but you're actually out there

43:19.280 --> 43:23.360
if you learn something, you post about it. If you get a win, you post about it. If you get a loss,

43:23.360 --> 43:28.720
you post about it. You're making connections. You're involved running an online business is

43:28.720 --> 43:34.720
very, very lonely at times. And guys, I don't know, five, six years ago, I finally made up my mind.

43:34.720 --> 43:39.280
I started in these groups and I was very scarcity mentality. Like Stephanie was talking about,

43:39.280 --> 43:42.880
I didn't want anybody to know who I was. Didn't want anyone to steal my niches. I didn't want

43:43.600 --> 43:50.800
to be on anyone's radar. And then in 2018, 2019, I started posting, sharing my journey,

43:50.800 --> 43:57.200
sharing my wins, sharing my losses. And guys, from these groups, I've made two business partnerships.

43:57.200 --> 44:00.880
I've made a joint venture. I make over a hundred thousand dollars a year from,

44:00.880 --> 44:06.160
and I've made some really, really good friends. So, but just understand you guys are in a group

44:06.160 --> 44:12.320
of people. It's like we got in the world and we've attracted all the people into this group,

44:12.320 --> 44:17.440
my group, people that want more highly driven people, people that aren't satisfied with just,

44:17.440 --> 44:22.400
you know, their everyday life. So really good point there. All right, guys, let's do this as

44:22.400 --> 44:26.480
we wrap up. I know we've been going for a while here. Does anybody want to spend just a few

44:26.480 --> 44:31.440
minutes? No more than just five, six minutes. If there's any questions, does anybody have any

44:31.440 --> 44:40.080
questions they want to ask Stephanie Porter on the topic of reselling, getting deals, getting to,

44:41.040 --> 44:46.720
you know, but basically a six figure per month or six figure per year

44:48.160 --> 44:52.800
amount, because, you know, 8,600 times up by 12, you're over the hundred thousand Porter,

44:52.800 --> 44:58.400
the same with you. Does anybody have any questions that they want to ask? I'll give just like a

44:58.400 --> 45:03.920
minute. If nobody does, we'll end the stream. And I have one last question I'm going to ask

45:03.920 --> 45:08.320
both of these guys to end. So let me just see before I ask this question, if there is anybody

45:08.720 --> 45:13.440
with any questions. Okay, so I'll keep my eye on this. Let me ask this question.

45:13.440 --> 45:18.640
And then if there's nothing, we'll just end this. So my question for both of you,

45:19.600 --> 45:24.640
let's start with Stephanie. Do you think everybody should pre-sell or is that only

45:24.640 --> 45:32.320
for a certain type of person? And if so, who? I think everybody should pre-sell because

45:33.520 --> 45:37.120
look, even if you do organic, you still have to get on the phone with the business owner.

45:37.200 --> 45:47.040
I mean, there's no reason not to pre-sell. I mean, there's really no reason not to pre-sell.

45:47.040 --> 45:49.760
Hey, you're preaching to the choir. You're preaching to the choir, don't you? You don't

45:49.760 --> 45:59.040
got to convince me. Unless you, you know, you just don't want to help Google or Facebook or,

45:59.040 --> 46:03.520
you know, any of these large companies. But, you know, I mean, there's really no reason not to.

46:04.480 --> 46:08.240
Yeah. There's a look, there's a learning click. For those of you who are like,

46:08.240 --> 46:13.520
there is a learning curve in learning how to run these ads. I mean, it is not, it's not a

46:13.520 --> 46:17.920
bitty cracker cook like cake. Like it's not like this little mic box, you know, this little box

46:17.920 --> 46:22.560
and you pour water and add, you know, like add one egg or whatever. It's not that easy, you know,

46:22.560 --> 46:27.680
but, but, but, but Nick, you know, Nick has people on staff that walk you through it and help you.

46:27.680 --> 46:32.160
And, and then there's some new tools that are available that make it much easier than back in

46:32.160 --> 46:36.800
the stone ages when Nick started this and had to do it all by hand. And, and, you know, so it's

46:36.800 --> 46:43.920
much easier now. And so, and by the way, the one thing I was worried about, not that I didn't want

46:43.920 --> 46:49.200
to tell my story, but when I first started to, went to now, but I think it's real common. People

46:49.200 --> 46:54.480
are worried that, that this industry is saturated because they see new people coming online and this

46:54.480 --> 47:00.640
and that guys, there is so much fricking business out there. It's, it's like ridiculous. Like,

47:00.640 --> 47:06.000
and even in the most like saturated niches, like, I mean, you know, it's, it's, there's so

47:06.000 --> 47:10.880
much business. I mean, it's, it's, and every day new businesses are opening up. And like, I mean,

47:12.080 --> 47:20.080
I shouldn't even say this, but I will. So like, I won't tell you which one it is, but I, I'm running

47:20.080 --> 47:25.680
ads and, and I'm in, I'm in a market and in the same niche that's in one of Nick's trading videos.

47:25.920 --> 47:33.200
I'll let you figure it out, Nick. That just shows like, like that shows, but the point is like that,

47:33.200 --> 47:36.720
that even there, like, I knew there's more room and like, so you, you don't know, you probably

47:36.720 --> 47:40.320
didn't know that because like, there's so much room, like there's so much business, like, I'm sure,

47:40.320 --> 47:43.360
like, I'm sure, you know, you're, you still have your business owner and then like, I found another

47:43.360 --> 47:47.120
business owner and I, you know, and so there's just so much room for opportunity.

47:47.120 --> 47:52.880
Yeah, a hundred percent. Like I've, I, it's funny because as, as I started training this

47:53.280 --> 47:56.640
I, it's funny because as, as I started training this, I started talking about, I've actually

47:56.640 --> 48:00.000
that happened more than once. I'll, I'll be looking at rankings or whatever. I'm like, oh,

48:00.000 --> 48:04.000
there's somebody that's coming in. And by the way, it doesn't make me mad zero. Cause I'm like,

48:04.000 --> 48:08.880
Hey, I can work with a business owner. You can work with a business owner and everybody can win

48:08.880 --> 48:12.080
because as long as we're kicking out all the other guys and then it doesn't matter. So,

48:12.080 --> 48:15.680
okay, Porter, what about you? Do you just, you don't have to, you don't have to agree or disagree,

48:15.680 --> 48:21.200
but do you think everybody should presale? I think so. And I do think that she've always used

48:21.840 --> 48:26.880
this, but like, it's just another tool that you can use. I think the best thing about this is

48:27.440 --> 48:32.080
no matter what you, you go into and you're doing your due diligence, you could look at two options.

48:32.080 --> 48:35.840
You either presale, which it could be your first option. And then if it's too competitive to run

48:35.840 --> 48:40.800
ads, you could organically rank and have those going. So I just love the fact that like you can

48:40.800 --> 48:45.440
be doing both. There's a happy medium to both of these, but like, as far as like personalities

48:45.440 --> 48:50.800
for pre-selling, I think anyone can do that. It doesn't matter where you come from. It's just

48:51.760 --> 48:56.000
if there's a process in place, I mean, like I said, the way that you present it,

48:56.000 --> 49:00.400
you're basically selling it before you're actually selling it. So I think it's a lot more about the

49:00.400 --> 49:06.400
setup than, as you mentioned, the sell. Yeah. I think it's like this guys. I think that even

49:06.400 --> 49:10.560
if you are having a strictly organic strategy, you should have one or two projects. You should

49:10.560 --> 49:16.000
be trying to get one, a deal at all times running some simple ads that can speed it up. There's no

49:16.000 --> 49:19.920
reason. You could have 90% of your strategy being organic, but there's no reason you shouldn't be

49:19.920 --> 49:25.360
running ads and getting deals up front. It's okay. It diversifies your portfolio. Yeah,

49:25.360 --> 49:28.720
a hundred percent. And the other thing I would just really quick mention, and then we'll wrap

49:28.720 --> 49:34.960
this up is I give this strategy, I talk about ads, I talk about, hey, we're going to run ads

49:34.960 --> 49:39.760
up front to a landing page, but you have to understand that you got to pay the piper or

49:39.760 --> 49:43.440
you got to pay somebody that's paid the piper because like, I'll give you this really quick

49:43.440 --> 49:46.960
example. I jumped on the phone with somebody. This is not from this group, by the way,

49:47.760 --> 49:50.720
jumped on the phone with somebody with Kyle about two weeks ago, three weeks ago,

49:51.760 --> 49:55.760
and this person was interested. They're in another group, not this one. They're not having the

49:55.760 --> 50:00.240
success that they want. It's not going fast enough, whatever. They want to run ads, blah, blah, blah.

50:00.240 --> 50:04.240
They don't know how to run ads. And they're like, let me get on. So they get on, they look at what

50:04.240 --> 50:08.560
it's like to work with me and what that looks like as far as a commitment and stuff. And anyway,

50:08.560 --> 50:14.000
long story short, they don't end up coming into the group. And I got a text today from this person

50:14.000 --> 50:18.080
and said, Hey, I just want to say, I appreciate you. You give so much value in your YouTube

50:18.080 --> 50:22.160
videos, blah, blah, blah. I actually feel like I'm in a pretty good spot. I went and bought a

50:22.160 --> 50:32.720
Udemy course on ads. And I think I'm going to be good. And I just took my phone and I was like,

50:32.720 --> 50:37.520
Hey, I don't want this to come across. So I did a voice note. I said, you're trying to do a

50:37.520 --> 50:42.800
shortcut here, bro. If the person that's on the, if the person actually spent a million,

50:42.800 --> 50:46.560
$1.5 million on ads like I did, and they actually know what they're doing, they're going to be

50:46.560 --> 50:50.480
selling a Udemy course for 15 bucks. I'm just telling you that right now. So you could keep

50:50.480 --> 50:54.080
going down the path. I've seen it a hundred times. You can go spin up some ads, waste a couple of

50:54.080 --> 50:58.640
thousand bucks, three months of your life, and we'll have the same conversation, or I can help

50:58.640 --> 51:05.040
you right now. So I say that because I love when people take action. I love when people get going,

51:05.040 --> 51:10.000
but realize that you either have to learn it over the course of four years and a $1.5 million,

51:10.000 --> 51:13.440
or you have to take it and you have to learn it from somebody that's done it. And I promise

51:13.440 --> 51:18.800
you, there's a lot of sharks out there. There's a lot of wolf in sheep's clothing, as they say

51:18.800 --> 51:22.240
in the Bible. And there's a lot of people that I know, and you guys know personally that are

51:22.240 --> 51:28.080
teaching this that aren't making jack shit on their own agency or never have. So the first thing,

51:28.080 --> 51:33.280
if you want to go to any training, I would go ahead and ask them, what have you made? Can you

51:33.280 --> 51:37.200
show me your Stripe account and tax returns? And what are you making right now? Because I promise

51:37.200 --> 51:42.000
you, it's going to eliminate 99.9% of people. Okay. That said, guys, I don't see any-

51:42.000 --> 51:46.480
Well, I want to clarify one thing. I just want to say this. So even though I said that I'm in one

51:46.480 --> 51:52.400
of your own markets, I do want to clarify because it's realized in that market, I'm running Facebook

51:52.400 --> 51:57.280
ads. So I'm swimming in a different pond. And even if you were running Google ads, Stephanie,

51:57.280 --> 52:01.760
I don't- Yeah, but no, but that's the other thing. I just want to show there's so many different ways

52:01.760 --> 52:06.560
you can slice and dice, so many different permutations and everything. Yeah. So I mean,

52:06.560 --> 52:10.320
there's so much business out there. So- Yeah. I have no worries at all. So-

52:11.200 --> 52:13.680
You got to DM me and see if you can guess what market it is.

52:13.680 --> 52:19.680
Okay. I'll DM me and they're like, hey, guess. And I'll shoot a guess. I think I've got a good guess

52:19.680 --> 52:22.720
because I've seen two different ones. So I'll guess.

52:22.720 --> 52:23.600
Really?

52:23.600 --> 52:28.000
Yeah. But maybe they're not both yours, obviously just one of them. But anyway, guys, appreciate

52:28.000 --> 52:33.120
you being on, appreciate Stephanie, appreciate Porter. If you guys do want to learn more about

52:33.120 --> 52:37.360
pre-selling, I have a YouTube channel, which a lot of Stephanie said, I think I have 2.1,000

52:37.360 --> 52:42.400
videos, just YouTube, my name, Nick Wood and RankinRet. We also, I have a free training

52:42.400 --> 52:46.640
if you go to rentsimplesights.com. In fact, Porter, while you're holding the baby, dude,

52:46.640 --> 52:50.880
hold on, freaking Porter. Stephanie, type that in the chat for me, rentsimplesights.com.

52:52.800 --> 52:55.200
You can go see blonde Nick, brown haired Nick. You can go see-

52:55.280 --> 52:58.160
Yeah, no, rentsimplesights, that one is brown haired Nick, don't worry.

52:59.280 --> 53:03.760
And also different lengths too. Sometimes it's short, sometimes it's really long.

53:03.760 --> 53:05.360
The Africa, Nick, you can see.

53:05.360 --> 53:10.960
Yeah, you got everything. You got everything. And then I'm going to drop one more link after

53:10.960 --> 53:16.800
you do that. About three weeks ago, some of you guys know I used to have a free Facebook

53:16.800 --> 53:20.800
group where we would cover any and everything related to pre-selling and this and that and the

53:20.800 --> 53:26.480
rest. And we got to this point where it just kind of got watered down with a bunch of looky-loo

53:26.480 --> 53:31.680
tire kickers. So we actually moved the group over to school. So I'll drop that. It's now called

53:31.680 --> 53:36.160
the RankinRet Academy. I'll drop a link to that. Don't feel like it's anything that you have to

53:36.160 --> 53:39.520
do, but it's just something that you can check out. So there's some links for you guys. It looks

53:39.520 --> 53:45.760
like Kevin said, hey, what's up, Nick, Porter, and Steph, cool. Yeah, by the way, Kevin says,

53:45.760 --> 53:53.200
cool VA. So Ford's the VA now. I love it. Anyway, check out those links. Check out those links.

53:55.440 --> 54:00.480
You know what I forgot to do, Porter? Me and Porter talked about this because he works with

54:00.480 --> 54:06.240
me a little bit. I actually, inside of my group, I actually paid Porter to help out my students

54:06.240 --> 54:10.320
where if they have a question, they can literally jump on a call. So let's do the same thing in

54:10.320 --> 54:13.280
this group. What's your phone number? Let's give them your cell phone number.

54:13.840 --> 54:25.520
So it's 435-393-5694. If you guys have a question, that's Porter's actual cell.

54:26.960 --> 54:34.400
Text Porter, call Porter, preferably text him and he'll be driving a tractor, doing his thing.

54:34.400 --> 54:38.320
And when he has like little 30 minute breaks, he'll jump on phone calls with people and help

54:38.320 --> 54:41.680
them out. So are you cool doing that with people in this group if they want? Yeah, that's totally

54:41.680 --> 54:49.760
cool. You have to message me anytime. Awesome. Are you on Snapchat, Porter? Snapchat, whatever.

54:51.520 --> 54:56.080
You're going to get a lot of tractor Snapchat videos on that. Also, Stephanie, I do want to ask

54:56.080 --> 55:05.840
one last question. What are you going to be at by December 31st? December 31st, what's MRR going to

55:05.840 --> 55:13.520
be at? 56. Okay, let's go. We're going to hold you to that. Okay, guys. Appreciate you being on.

55:13.520 --> 55:21.680
We'll see you next time. Thanks, guys.
