WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.480
Beautiful, all right, Ryan Dalton.

00:05.480 --> 00:10.260
So guys, real quick before we get into this call, which by the way, we're gonna be talking

00:10.260 --> 00:11.260
about 2025.

00:11.260 --> 00:16.140
We're gonna be talking about how to, I called this stream, this live is how to gear up for

00:16.140 --> 00:17.140
the best year of your life.

00:17.140 --> 00:24.540
And I wanted to have, you know, I mean, arguably, not arguably, I think hands down out of anybody

00:24.540 --> 00:36.580
in this, not even, I think, I know, hands down without a doubt, 2024 was your year,

00:36.580 --> 00:37.580
man.

00:37.580 --> 00:39.540
Yeah, 2024 was a great year.

00:39.540 --> 00:45.820
Yeah, I mean, 2023 had a great year, but 2024, you did some incredible things, which we're

00:45.820 --> 00:46.820
gonna get into.

00:46.820 --> 00:50.140
But real quick, I just wanted to make one quick announcement.

00:50.140 --> 00:52.460
By the way, Jahil, what's going on?

00:52.460 --> 00:58.620
One quick announcement, guys, is we talked about this, I kind of alluded to this, I think

00:58.620 --> 01:05.580
it was last week, but we are constantly, you know, listening to feedback from you guys

01:05.580 --> 01:09.820
on Rankin' Ren Engine as you guys, if any of you guys have no idea what we're talking

01:09.820 --> 01:15.180
about, rankinrenengine.com, that's the only tool you need for this business.

01:15.180 --> 01:17.580
We listen to the feedback.

01:17.580 --> 01:22.340
My team gives it to Ryan, and I know that you guys are giving it and we're listening.

01:22.340 --> 01:27.220
Obviously, there's people in other countries that those are things that we're gonna be

01:27.220 --> 01:28.220
rolling out.

01:28.220 --> 01:38.020
But one of the, I think, only things that was left on the tool was the backlinking piece.

01:38.020 --> 01:41.740
And the nice part is it still, you know, when you do the due diligence on Rankin' Ren Engine,

01:41.740 --> 01:45.100
you can still see the backlinks, it still gives you data.

01:45.340 --> 01:49.100
When Ryan and I discussed, I'm like, if we could go a little deeper to have something

01:49.100 --> 01:53.340
similar to like a man ghouls, where we could not just see the backlinks so we could look

01:53.340 --> 01:58.140
at the backlink profile, see the referring domains, I think this thing would be the most

01:58.140 --> 02:01.340
complete tool out there for Rankin' Ren.

02:01.340 --> 02:06.220
So Ryan, can you give us some kind of update in terms of that, I know you told me, but

02:06.220 --> 02:12.060
just for everybody else, when we can expect kind of that rollout, a conservative estimate

02:12.060 --> 02:14.380
on when we can expect that feature to be added?

02:16.140 --> 02:17.180
Yeah, for sure.

02:17.180 --> 02:23.420
Yeah, so I think in the next conservatively, in the next 30 days, we got the holidays coming

02:23.420 --> 02:24.060
up.

02:24.060 --> 02:26.860
So that's gonna make things a little bit slower than normal.

02:26.860 --> 02:29.420
But all the data is there, actually.

02:29.420 --> 02:32.700
So we have all the data to create that.

02:32.700 --> 02:37.340
Right now, we're just making everything look real pretty on the front end so that when

02:37.340 --> 02:43.020
you actually use that part of the tool, it looks pretty, which I'm a big believer in.

02:43.020 --> 02:45.500
So we'll have that rollout pretty soon.

02:45.500 --> 02:51.260
And people want to be able to do copycat backlinks and know where they're comparing backlinks

02:51.260 --> 02:51.820
and all that.

02:51.820 --> 02:54.220
So that's an easy addition.

02:54.220 --> 02:55.180
Beautiful.

02:55.180 --> 02:59.340
And by the way, there's going to be a few people because I do see some people that have

02:59.340 --> 03:02.060
joined in the last week, copycat backlinking.

03:03.180 --> 03:07.180
Well, let me just even go a little bit deeper and go very basic.

03:07.260 --> 03:12.220
Backlinking is, I would call it, kind of like a steroid to get your website ranked.

03:12.220 --> 03:16.140
If, you know, there are times when you don't have to backlink.

03:16.140 --> 03:20.860
If you go into a very, very easy city and niche, you do really good content, you do

03:20.860 --> 03:25.020
everything else very sound, I have ranked websites without any backlinks.

03:25.660 --> 03:30.940
But when your website gets stuck on page two, bottom of page one, or you just want to speed

03:30.940 --> 03:33.900
things up, backlinking is a steroid.

03:33.900 --> 03:39.660
It is a way to get the website kind of out of that rut and get it to the top of page

03:39.660 --> 03:39.980
one.

03:41.420 --> 03:47.900
But essentially, maybe, I know this is very basic for some people, but maybe, Ryan, in

03:47.900 --> 03:52.940
30 seconds, for those that there's a few people I know that are brand new to online, to SEO,

03:53.740 --> 03:54.860
what is backlinking?

03:54.860 --> 03:56.940
Just so everybody knows what the heck we're talking about.

03:56.940 --> 03:59.420
It's not that complicated, but it sounds complicated.

03:59.420 --> 04:05.660
Yeah, a backlink is any time that your website is referenced somewhere else on the internet,

04:05.660 --> 04:12.060
basically, and Google will rank based on what they call their EAT, acronym, expertise,

04:12.060 --> 04:13.580
authoritativeness, and trustliness.

04:14.220 --> 04:19.660
And one of the things they look for is all these different signals to see if your website

04:19.660 --> 04:22.700
meets their standard for ranking, right?

04:22.700 --> 04:28.460
Ultimately, they're trying to decide, is the website, are the websites that they're returning

04:28.460 --> 04:31.020
the search results answering the searcher's question?

04:31.740 --> 04:38.140
And the websites that have the highest expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness

04:38.140 --> 04:40.860
are going to answer the question better than ones that don't.

04:40.860 --> 04:44.460
So to find that, they look at all these different signals.

04:44.460 --> 04:49.580
And one of the key ones, one of the most important ones is backlinks, which are basically

04:49.580 --> 04:51.260
just a popular contest.

04:51.260 --> 04:57.660
It's other websites saying your website answers those questions about whatever that is, like

04:57.660 --> 05:00.780
a keyword, like concrete contractor, right?

05:00.780 --> 05:06.060
Other websites are talking about you as the concrete contractor and pointing to your URL

05:06.060 --> 05:07.260
from their website.

05:08.060 --> 05:11.900
That signals to Google, hey, this guy probably knows what he's doing with concrete.

05:11.900 --> 05:14.060
And then you rank higher than your competitors.

05:15.420 --> 05:15.920
That's it.

05:16.540 --> 05:18.780
Remember that, guys, the popularity contest.

05:18.780 --> 05:23.340
It's just like, I always think about like high school or your friends or whatever.

05:23.500 --> 05:28.700
It's like who you hang around is who people assume you are, right?

05:28.700 --> 05:32.780
So the way that you hang around people on the internet is people refer to you.

05:32.780 --> 05:34.540
People send you a backlink.

05:34.540 --> 05:42.380
And so, for example, let's just say, and it's kind of like a status thing, like Forbes.

05:42.380 --> 05:49.980
Forbes would have more status than any mommy blog or construction blog or whatever.

05:49.980 --> 05:53.820
So if Forbes gave me a backlink, they're telling Google, hey, Google, I have a lot

05:53.820 --> 05:54.780
of status.

05:54.780 --> 06:01.340
And this website, BentonvilleConcrete.com, I'm basically giving them my approval.

06:01.340 --> 06:05.740
And so then Google's looking at it going, OK, well, if Forbes says that, then they must

06:05.740 --> 06:07.100
have some status.

06:07.100 --> 06:10.860
And so it's basically this game of just getting people to link to you.

06:10.860 --> 06:11.660
And there are strategies.

06:11.660 --> 06:14.300
But one of the most common is called the copycat method.

06:14.300 --> 06:18.780
All it is is looking at other people that are winning, other people that are ranking,

06:19.340 --> 06:23.180
finding where they're getting backlinks, and just going and copycatting and doing the exact

06:23.180 --> 06:23.340
same.

06:23.340 --> 06:27.820
And so what we're saying to wrap all this up is this tool is going to allow you to go

06:27.820 --> 06:32.700
find those links and to be able to go and harvest them yourself.

06:32.700 --> 06:34.700
So it sounds like a lot.

06:34.700 --> 06:38.620
When I first got started, again, let's remember, I didn't know how to build a website.

06:38.620 --> 06:40.060
I didn't know what a domain was.

06:40.060 --> 06:41.740
And here we are talking about backlinks.

06:41.740 --> 06:43.180
It's not that complicated.

06:43.180 --> 06:48.540
So Gina says, I've been on a mission to figure out and set up backlinks for our sites.

06:48.540 --> 06:49.580
I'm still trying to figure it out.

06:49.580 --> 06:51.180
Yeah, it's really not that difficult.

06:51.180 --> 06:54.780
So what we'll do, maybe when we roll that feature out officially, we'll go and do a

06:54.780 --> 06:58.540
backlink training, just some basic one-on-one how to do backlinks.

06:58.540 --> 07:02.940
But yeah, guys, if you haven't already, you can use any tool you want.

07:02.940 --> 07:08.140
I know when I started, I was using a combination of seven different tools.

07:08.140 --> 07:11.020
I had all kinds of different stuff that we had opened up.

07:11.020 --> 07:16.700
I had even had a custom software built to track my paper lead stuff when I was doing

07:16.700 --> 07:17.740
that, which I don't recommend.

07:18.700 --> 07:22.700
But if you want to make it easy, go to RankinRentEngine.com, sign up for an account.

07:23.740 --> 07:26.620
It's ridiculously affordable.

07:26.620 --> 07:29.260
And we also have a code that...

07:30.940 --> 07:34.780
Ryan, for anybody that hasn't already, let's just write that code in the chat real quick.

07:38.060 --> 07:38.700
That's the one.

07:38.700 --> 07:43.020
And that's 20% off for the first two months.

07:43.020 --> 07:44.460
Yeah, I think I've got a bunch of codes.

07:44.460 --> 07:47.180
I think that's the one that has that one.

07:47.740 --> 07:49.580
So I can confirm that after the call.

07:49.580 --> 07:51.820
But yeah, I think it's 20% off for two months.

07:51.820 --> 07:52.700
Beautiful.

07:52.700 --> 07:53.980
So guys, go check it out.

07:53.980 --> 07:55.420
It's the only tool that we're using.

07:55.420 --> 07:58.460
It makes due diligence so much faster.

08:00.540 --> 08:01.740
Anyway, there's a million different things.

08:01.740 --> 08:02.700
That's not what this call is about.

08:02.700 --> 08:06.460
But just wanted to give a quick little plug for that and know that the backlinkings coming out.

08:06.460 --> 08:07.820
So move your stuff over.

08:07.820 --> 08:08.700
You can buy your phone.

08:08.700 --> 08:10.620
How much are your phone numbers through RankinRentEngine?

08:12.620 --> 08:13.740
Yeah, it depends on how you do it.

08:13.740 --> 08:16.780
So you could get additional, add additional sites.

08:16.780 --> 08:20.060
And if you add additional sites, the number comes free with it.

08:20.620 --> 08:22.300
Otherwise, they're $2.50 a month.

08:23.100 --> 08:24.300
Which is half the price.

08:24.300 --> 08:26.220
$2.50, right?

08:26.220 --> 08:26.940
Yeah.

08:26.940 --> 08:28.940
And I think on CallRail, even if you do...

08:31.420 --> 08:35.580
Even me, I've got a bunch of numbers because I'm moving my stuff over still.

08:37.020 --> 08:39.900
I think the cheapest I ever got them was like five bucks a number.

08:39.900 --> 08:40.620
I could be wrong.

08:40.620 --> 08:42.700
But that's very, very cheap.

08:43.340 --> 08:45.980
One of the things I realized about some of these other platforms is that they're

08:46.940 --> 08:53.500
like, they've got like different tiers that are kind of confusing versus like your

08:53.500 --> 08:56.300
programmable voice is add-on, your CRM is add-on.

08:56.300 --> 08:57.980
Look at some of these other competitors.

08:57.980 --> 09:01.100
And it just signals to me that it's just not made for RankinRent.

09:01.100 --> 09:07.500
It's made for like different marketing strategies or tools or whatever you're trying to do.

09:07.500 --> 09:10.220
But for RankinRent, it needs to be just pretty straightforward.

09:10.220 --> 09:13.020
Like you have to have programmable voice and messaging.

09:13.020 --> 09:13.980
So it's baked right in.

09:14.620 --> 09:15.580
Yep, yep.

09:15.580 --> 09:17.180
No, it's slick, man.

09:17.180 --> 09:18.540
It's super simple.

09:18.540 --> 09:22.860
So, okay, guys, that said, real quick, Jahil says, Ryan, quick question.

09:22.860 --> 09:24.940
I don't know if this is already in the works, but if it's possible,

09:24.940 --> 09:28.460
will there be a tracker in Rare that shows how many keywords someone here,

09:28.460 --> 09:30.700
someone has remaining for the day?

09:30.700 --> 09:32.220
Kind of similar to Mangools.

09:32.220 --> 09:33.420
Let me shut my door.

09:35.420 --> 09:35.900
Totally.

09:35.900 --> 09:36.060
Yeah.

09:36.060 --> 09:37.260
So that exists now.

09:37.260 --> 09:42.700
So if in the top right, you click on your profile and then you click on the usage tab,

09:43.500 --> 09:46.300
you can see daily keyword lookups remaining.

09:46.300 --> 09:49.180
And so your plan will determine how many that number is.

09:49.980 --> 09:55.260
But you can go in there and you can see for today how many lookups remain.

09:55.260 --> 09:57.340
You can also see your site lookups remaining.

09:58.380 --> 10:01.100
And those are really just basically API limitations

10:02.220 --> 10:07.260
to not spam the API at the end of the day for looking those up.

10:07.340 --> 10:13.740
But you can look at all your usage statuses under your profile on the usage tab.

10:15.340 --> 10:15.900
There you go.

10:15.900 --> 10:17.820
Hopefully that answered your question, Mr. Jahil.

10:19.020 --> 10:20.700
So let's get into this call, guys.

10:20.700 --> 10:22.060
It's December 17th.

10:22.060 --> 10:27.820
We have literally like two weeks to the day, like two weeks in a day, right?

10:28.700 --> 10:29.500
Yeah.

10:29.500 --> 10:30.780
It's almost over, man.

10:30.780 --> 10:31.900
Quarter four is almost done.

10:32.620 --> 10:33.340
That's crazy.

10:34.140 --> 10:35.420
I say this every year, dude.

10:35.420 --> 10:38.940
But it's like it feels like I just set my goals for 2024.

10:39.740 --> 10:40.060
Yeah.

10:40.060 --> 10:42.380
And here we freaking are.

10:42.380 --> 10:42.860
Okay.

10:42.860 --> 10:43.980
So let's talk about it, dude.

10:43.980 --> 10:44.380
I want to...

10:47.180 --> 10:55.900
So in 2024, Ryan, where were you at when 2024 started in terms of revenue?

10:57.820 --> 10:59.100
I will tell you right now.

10:59.100 --> 11:03.340
So January is a little bit weird because I did like trial or like discount rates for people,

11:03.340 --> 11:05.100
like in some areas in the winter.

11:05.100 --> 11:06.860
But I started...

11:09.980 --> 11:10.300
Yeah.

11:10.300 --> 11:15.020
So I came in at 2024 around $37,000 a month.

11:15.900 --> 11:16.220
Okay.

11:17.660 --> 11:18.160
Yeah.

11:19.420 --> 11:20.220
$38,000.

11:20.220 --> 11:21.500
I'm looking at my spreadsheet right now.

11:21.500 --> 11:25.180
$38,000 at the start of 2024.

11:25.980 --> 11:26.480
Okay.

11:26.860 --> 11:29.260
$37,000, $38,000 started 2024.

11:29.820 --> 11:33.420
And so, guys, let's keep in mind, Ryan, still...

11:34.060 --> 11:38.220
Up until, was it like a week and a half or two weeks ago, you had a full-time job?

11:38.220 --> 11:38.860
Still do.

11:38.860 --> 11:41.020
Through the 31st or the 50th year.

11:41.020 --> 11:41.980
I'm still got it.

11:41.980 --> 11:42.780
I'm done.

11:42.780 --> 11:43.340
Yeah.

11:43.340 --> 11:44.300
He's done after this.

11:44.300 --> 11:46.060
Two more weeks, but he's done.

11:46.060 --> 11:49.820
So he has a full-time job, which I still can't comprehend.

11:49.820 --> 11:50.700
He's got kids.

11:50.700 --> 11:51.820
He's got a wife.

11:51.820 --> 11:54.700
And he also does jujitsu.

11:54.700 --> 11:55.980
He's got a dog.

11:55.980 --> 11:57.820
He throws parties at his house.

11:57.820 --> 12:00.300
Not ragers, but like he brings his friends over.

12:00.300 --> 12:01.900
Like he has a million things going on, right?

12:02.380 --> 12:05.340
I'm sure you have a Christmas party because I know you do a 4th of July party.

12:05.900 --> 12:06.220
Yeah.

12:06.220 --> 12:10.300
So my friend group has, like everyone kind of does one of the parties.

12:10.300 --> 12:11.500
Mine are the summer ones.

12:11.500 --> 12:14.140
I've got Memorial Day, July 4th, and Labor Day.

12:14.140 --> 12:15.180
So they're the best ones.

12:15.180 --> 12:15.980
They're the best ones.

12:15.980 --> 12:16.540
Let's be honest.

12:17.180 --> 12:18.540
Yeah, for sure.

12:18.540 --> 12:21.100
So, okay, so let's just think about this.

12:21.100 --> 12:26.860
So in the last 11 and a half months, you've added $50,000 of revenue per month, right?

12:26.860 --> 12:29.420
So you're around, what are you at, 87, 88?

12:29.980 --> 12:34.700
Yeah, I'm at when I've got a couple of people, their own discount rates,

12:34.700 --> 12:39.980
but when they come off of those, I'll be at 89.5.

12:41.500 --> 12:41.740
Okay.

12:44.300 --> 12:46.060
I'm just, you just gave me a thought.

12:46.060 --> 12:47.100
So I want to write it down.

12:49.180 --> 12:49.740
89.5.

12:49.740 --> 12:53.500
So I added $50,000 of revenue while having a full-time job.

12:53.500 --> 12:59.180
And the most impressive part is on top of that, you also built rank and run engine.

13:00.300 --> 13:00.940
Yeah.

13:00.940 --> 13:07.100
Which, of course, he hired developers, but he was very tightly project managing that entire thing.

13:07.980 --> 13:11.740
And so as I sat here and I'm thinking about New Year's, or the New Year,

13:11.740 --> 13:12.780
I'm thinking about 2025.

13:12.780 --> 13:14.460
I'm thinking about all these things I want to accomplish.

13:14.460 --> 13:21.980
I'm like, what better person to have on than the person that had the best year out of anybody,

13:21.980 --> 13:25.580
not only in my group, but in the free group, not only in this group, but in the free group,

13:25.580 --> 13:28.860
but of, I would say any of the people that I know.

13:28.860 --> 13:30.220
So I want to talk about that, dude.

13:30.220 --> 13:32.300
I want to know, let's reverse engineer.

13:32.300 --> 13:36.300
What did you do that made such a difference from the year before,

13:36.300 --> 13:38.060
which you had a phenomenal year the year before?

13:38.060 --> 13:41.900
And guys, for those that are new, like some of you guys that are, reach your first call.

13:41.900 --> 13:45.340
Ryan, two, was it about two years ago?

13:45.340 --> 13:46.140
When did you start this?

13:47.020 --> 13:48.460
I'm going into my third year.

13:49.100 --> 13:49.900
That's crazy.

13:49.900 --> 13:51.900
Two years ago, I didn't know what this was.

13:52.700 --> 14:00.300
Yeah, so 2022 February was the first time that I turned on a Google ad.

14:02.060 --> 14:03.020
I'm not crazy.

14:03.020 --> 14:03.580
It's wild.

14:04.300 --> 14:10.220
And it's inspiring because that's the possibilities of what's possible.

14:10.220 --> 14:12.140
So two years ago, he didn't even know what this was.

14:12.140 --> 14:19.900
Now he's at $87,000, $89,000 a month, built a tool that's phenomenal for this space.

14:19.900 --> 14:22.300
I think it's the best tool out there already.

14:22.300 --> 14:25.340
It's going to be hands down the best tool once he had a few more features

14:26.220 --> 14:30.300
and done all this while having a family, while having a job.

14:30.940 --> 14:32.540
And I just want to know, dude.

14:32.540 --> 14:35.740
So I basically with this, I just want to, what did you do?

14:35.740 --> 14:36.780
How did you start the year?

14:36.780 --> 14:39.420
How did you gear up for 2025?

14:39.420 --> 14:40.380
What was your mindset?

14:40.380 --> 14:41.500
What was your planning?

14:41.500 --> 14:46.540
What was your, did you get rid of a bunch of unnecessary things?

14:46.540 --> 14:48.460
How did you manage all of this?

14:49.340 --> 14:51.900
So I mean, that was like five questions, but we could start with one of them.

14:51.900 --> 14:52.940
So let's get down.

14:53.660 --> 14:55.420
I love the mindset stuff, man.

14:55.420 --> 14:58.380
Like the mindset, I know some people think it's cheesy and they're like,

14:58.380 --> 14:59.900
oh, I'll talk about mindset again.

14:59.900 --> 15:06.060
But I am a, I'm just a huge believer in this business model.

15:06.060 --> 15:09.900
And it doesn't, I was telling my wife this other day, it doesn't feel like work to me.

15:09.900 --> 15:13.660
Like that's, I think one of the biggest differences, like people like, oh, like,

15:13.660 --> 15:17.020
you know, you're up at nine o'clock at night, like working on something.

15:17.020 --> 15:18.460
It doesn't feel like work.

15:19.020 --> 15:20.540
It feels like play to me.

15:20.540 --> 15:24.460
Like when I'm figuring out how to grow, how to expand, how to do the next thing,

15:24.460 --> 15:25.420
it doesn't feel like work.

15:25.420 --> 15:28.220
And I have like pretty good work-life balance.

15:28.220 --> 15:31.900
So I'm not always trying to like, you know, be in front of a computer,

15:31.900 --> 15:35.820
but when I am in front of a computer, it feels like something I really enjoy.

15:36.860 --> 15:41.660
And the other part of it is, is that I think the AI is going to change our future

15:42.300 --> 15:43.260
quite drastically.

15:43.260 --> 15:49.500
And I think that the trades, the services that we help enable

15:49.500 --> 15:52.620
through the lead that we provide are not going anywhere.

15:52.620 --> 15:57.340
And my guess is they're probably going to be the last to be impacted.

15:57.340 --> 16:00.300
Like, how are you going to have a robot put in a concrete driveway?

16:00.300 --> 16:01.100
You know what I'm saying?

16:01.900 --> 16:06.460
So like, I am thinking way forward because I work in tech, you know,

16:06.460 --> 16:10.940
I've worked in tech for years and I know that there's a lot of jobs

16:10.940 --> 16:12.860
that are just like all coming on the chopping block.

16:12.860 --> 16:17.340
But I don't think that the trades are anywhere near in jeopardy of that.

16:17.340 --> 16:18.220
Like think about it, right?

16:18.220 --> 16:21.100
Like you're going to have a brick mason that's going to be replaced by a robot.

16:21.100 --> 16:25.740
No, or a concrete guy, or none of the trades, the roofer or whatever,

16:25.740 --> 16:29.500
are going to be, I think, in the near term impacted by AI.

16:29.500 --> 16:34.220
And so I'm trying to align myself and my company and my finances

16:34.220 --> 16:40.300
and my vision for things that are enduring and lead generation for tradespeople

16:40.300 --> 16:44.860
is, I think, a really, really safe, safe move.

16:44.860 --> 16:47.580
And so I want to grow a business that is future proofed.

16:48.140 --> 16:48.640
Yeah.

16:49.340 --> 16:53.500
So, and that's one of the things when I started this business,

16:53.500 --> 16:57.340
there was a lot of different factors that were, you know, important to me,

16:57.340 --> 17:01.180
scalability, recurring, all those different things.

17:01.180 --> 17:07.100
But I didn't even really consider that piece or the piece that

17:07.100 --> 17:09.980
this is a pretty recession resistant industry, right?

17:10.220 --> 17:12.860
Obviously, we've all probably talked to our business owners,

17:12.860 --> 17:15.660
like I had a business owner during the elections,

17:15.660 --> 17:18.780
and right before that, he kind of got a little shaky on me.

17:19.500 --> 17:23.980
I don't know if people are still buying, and by the way, he's still with us.

17:23.980 --> 17:27.100
Now that the elections are over, I think it was all in his head.

17:27.100 --> 17:29.260
Now he's like, people are finally starting to buy again.

17:29.260 --> 17:31.900
Maybe not, but he's good now.

17:31.900 --> 17:35.340
But outside of that, dude, we really didn't have,

17:35.340 --> 17:39.420
like I don't think we had any cancellations, nothing that was directly tied to that.

17:39.420 --> 17:44.620
But I didn't think about the fact that this is very recession resistant,

17:45.340 --> 17:47.260
a business, a very recession resistant business.

17:47.260 --> 17:51.100
And I've also a very, it has a lot of longevity because it's just a very,

17:51.820 --> 17:54.140
guys, I think you probably realize this too, Ryan,

17:54.140 --> 17:57.420
but like the more I'm in business and just in life in general,

17:58.140 --> 18:01.500
the more I'm attracted to stuff that's simple, right?

18:01.500 --> 18:04.140
Simple scales, simple is sexy.

18:04.140 --> 18:07.740
It's like all these complex things I don't want anything to do with.

18:07.740 --> 18:11.180
And this is such a simple business model that it just makes sense.

18:11.180 --> 18:15.740
So going back to the mindset stuff, is there anything that you can give us?

18:15.740 --> 18:17.740
Like, what do you do?

18:17.740 --> 18:23.420
How did you prepare and how did that have to do with your year in 2024?

18:23.420 --> 18:26.620
And what advice would you give anyone that's on this call

18:26.620 --> 18:29.660
for how to get their mind right going into 2025?

18:31.100 --> 18:34.380
Yeah, so I agree with you about the simple stuff.

18:34.380 --> 18:36.620
I just, I got the chat over here on the left.

18:36.620 --> 18:38.940
I think Tim asked a question about AI chat bots.

18:38.940 --> 18:43.340
And this kind of goes with my answer to this question is that

18:45.980 --> 18:52.860
I think that there are a lot of ways to try to improve your agency

18:52.860 --> 18:56.620
that feel like you're improving your agency, but you're just getting distracted.

18:56.620 --> 19:03.580
So what I try to avoid is things that are going to become a problem at scale.

19:03.580 --> 19:07.900
And so that means, you know, like if there's some plugin that looks cool,

19:07.900 --> 19:11.180
or if there's some AI chat bot, or if there's, you know,

19:11.180 --> 19:15.020
whatever there is the thing that people are testing out

19:15.020 --> 19:16.700
and kind of the SEO world or whatever.

19:17.500 --> 19:22.060
Generally, I found those are distractions is that rarely do I find something

19:22.060 --> 19:26.380
that is so valuable, I will bake it into my agency from the top to bottom.

19:26.380 --> 19:29.500
And I will, if I'm not careful, I'm prone to this.

19:29.500 --> 19:30.700
I'm super prone to this.

19:30.700 --> 19:37.580
I will catch myself testing lots of different little things that are just time sucks,

19:39.100 --> 19:43.900
that are creating complexity in my agency instead of simplicity.

19:43.900 --> 19:47.100
Like I'm always thinking about how to make it simpler, actually.

19:47.100 --> 19:52.300
So if I'm putting my time into something, it's not adding complexity.

19:52.300 --> 19:55.820
It's reducing it in some areas, whether that's, you know,

19:55.820 --> 20:01.740
automations or like tying things together with like the finance stuff on the back end

20:01.740 --> 20:05.580
or those kinds of things, making it simpler rather than more complex.

20:05.580 --> 20:09.020
And sometimes maybe AI chat bots will actually make it simpler for you

20:09.020 --> 20:12.140
because you're able to get leads to a business owner

20:12.140 --> 20:15.820
in a way that is actually more streamlined, valid.

20:15.820 --> 20:18.220
But I'm always trying to think about how to simplify.

20:18.220 --> 20:23.820
Even at my current run rate, I'm thinking about how to make my agency simpler

20:23.820 --> 20:26.940
and just smoother in its operations.

20:27.740 --> 20:36.060
Yeah. Yeah, and it's also, I feel like when you first start out,

20:36.060 --> 20:38.860
it's always about addition and how, what do I need to add?

20:38.860 --> 20:40.220
What do I need to start doing?

20:40.220 --> 20:44.300
And then you realize it's more about what, it's about subtraction.

20:45.740 --> 20:49.580
What in this next year can I get rid of in my business

20:49.580 --> 20:52.700
and in my processes and my systems in my life

20:53.260 --> 20:56.060
so I can just focus on one single thing?

20:56.060 --> 21:01.180
And so that was a huge thing for me when I had my biggest year in terms of like growth

21:01.180 --> 21:07.740
when 2020 from 8 to 10,000 up to 100,000, that was a year of simplicity.

21:07.740 --> 21:10.380
And it was getting rid of a lot of distractions,

21:10.380 --> 21:13.740
getting rid of a lot of little micro businesses inside the business,

21:13.740 --> 21:17.900
selling the SEO, selling this service, that service, consulting,

21:17.900 --> 21:19.820
focusing on a bunch of different niches,

21:19.820 --> 21:23.020
trying a bunch of different strategies to onboard customers.

21:23.020 --> 21:26.460
And it was just, I was just cutting stuff, cutting stuff, cutting stuff.

21:26.460 --> 21:28.380
And I would just wake up, same thing.

21:30.300 --> 21:33.820
Get a new area, two areas, put up some ads, go do a deal.

21:33.820 --> 21:34.780
And that was it, man.

21:34.780 --> 21:35.740
And that's how I scaled.

21:35.740 --> 21:37.020
And it was so easy.

21:37.020 --> 21:37.660
It wasn't easy.

21:37.660 --> 21:40.380
It was just mentally, I had a lot of clarity.

21:40.380 --> 21:47.340
So for you mindset-wise, are there, are you somebody that does like,

21:47.340 --> 21:48.380
what do you do for that?

21:48.380 --> 21:49.340
Is it reading?

21:49.340 --> 21:51.020
Is it talking to certain people?

21:51.020 --> 21:53.340
Is it listening to certain things?

21:53.340 --> 21:55.180
Like, what do you do to gear up that way?

21:55.900 --> 21:59.580
Yeah, it's, I read a lot.

21:59.580 --> 22:00.460
I got this book.

22:02.940 --> 22:04.940
It's called Blitz Scaling.

22:04.940 --> 22:05.820
Have you read this?

22:05.820 --> 22:07.180
I've never even heard of that book.

22:07.180 --> 22:07.660
It looks interesting.

22:07.660 --> 22:11.180
It's the founder of, the co-founder of LinkedIn.

22:11.180 --> 22:15.660
He's a partner at a firm called Greylock Partners.

22:15.660 --> 22:18.140
Yeah, Greylock's is venture capital, right?

22:19.100 --> 22:25.580
And the tagline is the lightning fast path to building massively valuable companies.

22:26.620 --> 22:27.100
Interesting.

22:27.100 --> 22:28.540
And I was like, I can't read this.

22:28.540 --> 22:29.900
That I got to read that.

22:29.900 --> 22:30.540
So I'm reading it.

22:30.540 --> 22:37.420
Like one of his big ideas is that you have to, well, you don't have to,

22:37.420 --> 22:42.700
but he talks about growing to optimize for speed,

22:42.700 --> 22:46.700
which you talk about all the time over efficiency.

22:46.700 --> 22:49.820
And the idea is, is you'll figure out the efficiency later.

22:49.820 --> 22:53.660
And so my inclination is towards efficiency,

22:53.660 --> 22:57.020
where I want to have everything like buttoned up, like as I grow.

22:57.020 --> 22:59.500
And so it means my growth is kind of like this.

22:59.500 --> 23:04.460
Whereas if you focus on speed, you'll figure out the inefficiencies later on.

23:04.460 --> 23:08.300
You'll figure out like the, which is more your style, right?

23:08.300 --> 23:12.220
Which is more like you'll grow and then like you'll figure out the pieces

23:12.220 --> 23:14.940
that you got to figure out to make it real smooth.

23:15.900 --> 23:18.860
And so this book has really challenged my mindset.

23:18.860 --> 23:19.740
So I like to read.

23:19.740 --> 23:20.460
I like to read stuff.

23:20.460 --> 23:22.380
Okay. By the way, is that Reid Hoffman?

23:23.260 --> 23:27.740
Yeah. Reid Hoffman and Chris Yeh are the co-authors.

23:27.740 --> 23:29.340
Interesting guy. I like that guy.

23:29.900 --> 23:30.620
It's a good read.

23:31.660 --> 23:36.620
So give us three recommended books for mindset going into this year.

23:36.620 --> 23:40.700
And guys, again, also just as for the person that's going to go and be like,

23:40.700 --> 23:42.700
well, I'm going to go read for eight hours today,

23:42.700 --> 23:44.540
because that's what Warren Buffett does.

23:44.540 --> 23:46.620
No, that's just things to read.

23:46.620 --> 23:50.540
I'm sure Ryan probably reads 10 pages to 30 minutes a day.

23:50.540 --> 23:52.780
He probably doesn't sit and read for three hours.

23:52.780 --> 23:55.340
So let's not go too extreme here.

23:55.340 --> 24:00.460
But anyway, give us three recommended books on mindset that have really helped you.

24:02.460 --> 24:03.980
Three books on mindset that helped me.

24:06.620 --> 24:08.380
The three that come to mind are

24:09.260 --> 24:12.540
Humilitas.

24:13.980 --> 24:18.220
The theory behind Humilitas is the big idea with each book.

24:18.220 --> 24:20.060
And you can decide if you're interested.

24:20.060 --> 24:23.900
Humilitas is the idea that one of the missing things for success in life

24:23.900 --> 24:28.460
is the combination of steely grit and humility.

24:29.580 --> 24:34.460
Those two things are like what drives some of the most successful people in the world.

24:34.460 --> 24:35.420
Great book.

24:35.420 --> 24:38.620
Another is Meditations by Marcus Aurelius.

24:38.620 --> 24:39.740
You can see where my shoulder.

24:39.740 --> 24:40.700
See that guy right there?

24:41.500 --> 24:43.420
See the bust of the dude behind me?

24:47.260 --> 24:48.220
Is that Meditations?

24:49.660 --> 24:51.100
Yeah, boy.

24:51.100 --> 24:52.940
Yeah, of course.

24:52.940 --> 24:53.500
Yeah, dude.

24:53.500 --> 24:54.780
That's the good stuff.

24:54.780 --> 24:56.140
You got it on your desk.

24:56.140 --> 24:56.540
All right.

24:57.580 --> 24:58.060
Yeah, man.

24:59.740 --> 25:01.580
Meditations is the big idea.

25:01.580 --> 25:03.020
It's the Stoic principles.

25:03.740 --> 25:08.540
It's a little bit, it's philosophy, but the ideas in it are really good for business.

25:09.580 --> 25:10.860
I went through Y Combinator.

25:10.860 --> 25:13.980
And one of the things that Y Combinator said when they look for a founder

25:14.620 --> 25:17.900
is they want someone who a bomb can go off.

25:17.900 --> 25:19.180
And they just look at it.

25:19.180 --> 25:21.100
And they're like, huh, a bomb went off.

25:21.100 --> 25:22.700
And they go back to solving problems.

25:22.700 --> 25:24.380
Like whatever the problems that bomb caused.

25:24.380 --> 25:26.380
Like the James Bond kind of idea, right?

25:27.020 --> 25:30.780
Meditations is the operating system for the mind, right?

25:31.260 --> 25:34.940
Your brain, like a computer, needs an operating system.

25:35.580 --> 25:37.420
And if you don't have an operating system,

25:37.420 --> 25:39.980
it means that you're just sort of a kind of a mess, right?

25:39.980 --> 25:44.780
So having a deliberately created operating system for your brain

25:44.780 --> 25:46.300
is the purpose of philosophy.

25:46.300 --> 25:48.620
And Meditations is great for business

25:48.620 --> 25:51.500
because there are no shortage of problems in business.

25:51.500 --> 25:53.580
For example, if I've got a business owner

25:54.300 --> 25:58.380
who I'm killing it for, and I'm getting 80 liens a month,

25:58.460 --> 26:00.140
and he calls me and he cancels

26:01.340 --> 26:03.500
because he is getting tons of commercial job

26:03.500 --> 26:06.060
that I helped him get, right?

26:06.060 --> 26:07.820
I helped him get all that commercial work

26:07.820 --> 26:11.420
and now he's not interested in my 80% residential leads, right?

26:11.420 --> 26:12.540
He's canceling on me.

26:13.100 --> 26:15.420
That is completely outside of my control.

26:15.420 --> 26:17.100
I have no control over that.

26:17.100 --> 26:20.460
And so when I get upset about it, no, right?

26:21.420 --> 26:22.860
I shouldn't anyway, right?

26:22.860 --> 26:23.660
It's out of my control.

26:23.660 --> 26:25.020
Why should I get upset about it?

26:25.020 --> 26:28.300
That's one of the big concepts in Meditations

26:28.300 --> 26:30.140
is it teaches your brain to be like,

26:30.140 --> 26:31.740
oh, this problem happened.

26:31.740 --> 26:34.220
Huh, okay, I'm gonna go solve it, right?

26:34.220 --> 26:34.780
It's really good.

26:36.380 --> 26:38.220
And then the third one was

26:38.220 --> 26:39.900
Never Split the Difference by Chris Voss.

26:42.540 --> 26:46.060
The art of negotiation, persuasion, empathy, and active listening.

26:46.620 --> 26:48.060
All three great for business.

26:48.700 --> 26:49.100
Beautiful.

26:49.100 --> 26:50.380
So I've linked up two.

26:50.380 --> 26:51.660
I'm gonna link up this last one

26:51.660 --> 26:54.220
so everyone can have an easy way.

26:54.220 --> 26:59.100
By the way, there is no affiliate here.

26:59.100 --> 27:00.940
I just went to Amazon to type these in.

27:02.060 --> 27:03.740
I wish there was an affiliate for books.

27:03.740 --> 27:05.980
I need a bigger audience to get an affiliate for.

27:05.980 --> 27:07.820
Yeah, yeah, I agree.

27:07.820 --> 27:08.620
It would be nice.

27:09.260 --> 27:11.500
So those are the three that Ryan recommends, guys.

27:11.500 --> 27:15.100
Humilitas, Meditations, and Never Split the Difference.

27:15.100 --> 27:16.380
I've never even heard of the first one.

27:16.380 --> 27:19.180
I've heard of the other two, obviously, but that's awesome.

27:19.180 --> 27:23.020
Okay, so now tell us like, how did you set your,

27:23.020 --> 27:28.220
what was your goal setting that process like about a year ago?

27:28.220 --> 27:31.500
I guess it would have been December 2023

27:31.500 --> 27:33.420
as you're gearing up for 2024.

27:33.420 --> 27:34.460
What was that like, dude?

27:37.020 --> 27:40.940
Yeah, this is an area that I am not very good at actually,

27:40.940 --> 27:42.380
and I need to do it for this year.

27:43.820 --> 27:48.060
I'm really good at committing today to what I need is required

27:48.060 --> 27:50.620
and what will take to move the needle today.

27:50.620 --> 27:52.140
Like that's my strength.

27:52.140 --> 27:55.500
My weakness is I'm not good at setting a goal

27:55.500 --> 27:58.300
and backward planning with key performance indicators.

27:58.300 --> 28:01.580
I do this in my job, or I did in my job.

28:01.580 --> 28:03.020
I don't know why I didn't do it in my agency.

28:03.020 --> 28:04.620
It's weird, like a mental thing.

28:05.500 --> 28:07.900
So I wouldn't say that I sat down in December of last year

28:07.900 --> 28:09.420
and like planned out this year.

28:09.980 --> 28:11.660
The thing that I did in December though,

28:11.660 --> 28:15.580
is I realized I had like pretty significant chunk of time

28:15.580 --> 28:17.180
under my belt of like really knowing

28:17.180 --> 28:18.780
how to do this business model.

28:18.780 --> 28:21.260
And then realizing that going into next year,

28:21.260 --> 28:23.020
I need to be aggressive.

28:23.020 --> 28:26.140
And I invested, I reinvested back into my agency

28:26.140 --> 28:27.900
a significant amount of money

28:27.900 --> 28:29.420
that I could have taken as profit,

28:29.420 --> 28:31.260
that I just dumped back in.

28:31.260 --> 28:33.500
And I attribute a lot of that to my growth.

28:35.020 --> 28:38.860
So when you started the year, you didn't have in mind,

28:38.860 --> 28:41.260
hey, I want to hit this revenue number or anything like that?

28:41.900 --> 28:43.980
No, that's what's easy.

28:46.380 --> 28:47.580
Bad at that kind of thing.

28:48.460 --> 28:51.740
It's an air of opportunity for me for sure.

28:53.660 --> 28:54.700
That's crazy, bro.

28:54.700 --> 28:56.140
So you didn't have any idea,

28:56.140 --> 28:58.140
in the back of your mind, did you say, hey,

28:58.140 --> 28:59.580
like obviously you didn't sit down and write it down,

28:59.580 --> 29:01.500
but in the back of your mind, did you sit down and think,

29:01.500 --> 29:03.900
I want to hit this revenue target?

29:05.340 --> 29:07.740
Well, you had me on a call with two others a while back

29:08.300 --> 29:11.020
and we all joked about who's going to be the first to get to 83.

29:11.820 --> 29:13.260
And I said, I'm going to be the first.

29:13.260 --> 29:15.820
And so I knew in my brain, I never forgot that.

29:16.540 --> 29:18.300
And I was like, I don't know if I was the first.

29:18.300 --> 29:20.220
I don't know if those, I hope both of them did it.

29:20.220 --> 29:21.340
Both those guys are all small.

29:21.340 --> 29:23.580
Both those guys, I hope they both did it.

29:23.580 --> 29:24.940
I have no idea where their agencies are.

29:24.940 --> 29:28.460
But I was like, even if it's not a competition, I'm going to do it.

29:29.100 --> 29:31.980
And so I think in some ways, that was my goal for this year

29:31.980 --> 29:34.060
is to get to the million recurring.

29:37.020 --> 29:41.260
So just for anyone that hasn't been on any of these calls with Ryan.

29:41.260 --> 29:43.660
So Ryan has already made a million dollars.

29:43.660 --> 29:46.300
This has been months ago, total, since he started.

29:46.300 --> 29:49.100
But now he's on the run rate to make a million dollars per year.

29:50.700 --> 29:55.340
Which again is crazy because you literally just decided

29:55.340 --> 29:57.020
to start researching business models.

29:57.820 --> 29:59.580
And it's not like anything goes wrong with your job.

29:59.580 --> 30:01.180
It's not like you don't like your job.

30:01.180 --> 30:03.100
It's not like you aren't getting paid very well.

30:04.380 --> 30:06.460
You just saw the writing on the wall and you're like, dude,

30:06.460 --> 30:11.660
I don't want to be in a position of someone else controlling my future

30:11.660 --> 30:13.980
or controlling my paycheck.

30:13.980 --> 30:16.940
And so it's crazy, bro.

30:16.940 --> 30:17.580
It's a crazy...

30:19.740 --> 30:22.620
How many months of research did you do before you actually found this model?

30:23.340 --> 30:23.980
About three.

30:23.980 --> 30:27.500
I started in like, probably the end of 2021,

30:27.500 --> 30:31.100
just getting up in the morning and just reading about different business models.

30:31.100 --> 30:35.260
Like I knew I was going to commit to one going into the next year,

30:35.260 --> 30:41.260
where all year, full year, I was going to commit to one and not look back.

30:41.260 --> 30:45.980
And if I failed, I knew I gave it a real shot.

30:45.980 --> 30:47.020
You know what I'm saying?

30:47.020 --> 30:49.260
Like I really gave a real shot at it.

30:50.780 --> 30:53.180
That's the only way that you can know if something works or not.

30:53.180 --> 30:54.140
You can't flirt with it.

30:54.140 --> 30:55.260
You can't try it a little bit.

30:56.300 --> 30:57.740
You got to go for it.

30:57.740 --> 31:01.260
And so I wanted to make sure that the decision I made

31:01.260 --> 31:06.060
about the industry or business model or whatever that I went into

31:06.060 --> 31:10.380
was informed as much by my goals as possible.

31:10.380 --> 31:12.860
And it turned out all right.

31:13.500 --> 31:14.940
Yeah, I'd say it turned out all right, man.

31:16.460 --> 31:17.020
Yeah.

31:17.020 --> 31:17.660
That's insane.

31:19.100 --> 31:20.540
It's exciting even for me.

31:21.660 --> 31:25.260
By the way, Adair said he just closed a business owner just now for $800 a month.

31:25.260 --> 31:26.300
He'll have to watch the replay.

31:26.300 --> 31:28.300
So you got to love that.

31:29.020 --> 31:29.580
Love that.

31:30.380 --> 31:30.940
Got to love that.

31:30.940 --> 31:32.220
That's okay.

31:32.220 --> 31:32.620
Go ahead.

31:33.260 --> 31:34.220
Fires me up.

31:34.220 --> 31:35.980
I love closed deals.

31:35.980 --> 31:36.460
Me too.

31:36.460 --> 31:38.700
I love that because...

31:38.780 --> 31:41.260
And by the way, guys, if you ever have to come down to

31:42.700 --> 31:45.660
getting on this call or doing that, that is what you should be doing.

31:45.660 --> 31:47.980
So if you have to schedule a call, just schedule the call.

31:47.980 --> 31:48.620
Go close the deal.

31:48.620 --> 31:49.420
You can watch the replay.

31:49.420 --> 31:51.420
We do love having you on here if you don't have that going on.

31:51.420 --> 31:53.580
But that's what this business model is about.

31:54.460 --> 31:56.460
And going back to the simplicity thing,

31:58.060 --> 31:59.820
the way you're going to make the most amount of money,

31:59.820 --> 32:02.780
the most amount of progress in 2025, guys,

32:02.780 --> 32:08.140
is by focusing on how can you ask the most amount of people for money.

32:08.940 --> 32:09.420
Absolutely.

32:10.220 --> 32:12.380
As much as you need to learn the basics,

32:12.380 --> 32:13.660
you need to learn the back linking,

32:13.660 --> 32:15.260
you need to learn the content,

32:15.260 --> 32:16.780
you need to learn how to build sites,

32:17.500 --> 32:21.180
you need to focus on how to get business owners to pay you.

32:22.220 --> 32:22.620
That's it.

32:23.900 --> 32:25.100
I learned that from you, man.

32:25.100 --> 32:28.460
That was something that I can hear your voice in my head sometimes

32:28.460 --> 32:29.420
when I think about that.

32:29.420 --> 32:33.340
I think that is just great business advice is

32:33.340 --> 32:35.500
the more that you can ask people for money,

32:36.140 --> 32:37.900
the faster your agency is going to grow.

32:38.380 --> 32:40.940
That's one of the big things I learned in digital landlords is,

32:42.060 --> 32:44.700
and your calls and you talking about that concept,

32:45.980 --> 32:52.460
and my goal became one closing call a week.

32:53.660 --> 32:55.420
I have to have one closing call a week.

32:55.420 --> 32:57.980
If there's not a closing call in a week, I'm upset.

32:57.980 --> 32:59.180
It's not someone else's fault.

32:59.180 --> 32:59.740
It's my fault.

33:00.780 --> 33:03.420
But I have to have a closing call every week.

33:03.420 --> 33:06.620
And now I'm trying to get to where I want two closing calls per week.

33:06.620 --> 33:08.540
We've had as many as six in a week.

33:09.180 --> 33:10.060
That's an outlier.

33:10.060 --> 33:11.660
That's by far the exception.

33:12.300 --> 33:15.420
But it's based on that principle that I learned in digital landlords is

33:15.420 --> 33:17.100
you just have to be asking people for money

33:17.100 --> 33:18.380
because if you're not, it's a hobby.

33:19.260 --> 33:19.980
Yeah.

33:19.980 --> 33:20.220
Yeah.

33:20.220 --> 33:21.420
And people don't want to hear that.

33:21.420 --> 33:23.340
Especially people in other groups.

33:23.340 --> 33:27.420
Sometimes maybe I'll go and do a call with people in other groups.

33:27.420 --> 33:33.580
And I'll always ask how many people are making money and whatever.

33:33.580 --> 33:34.300
We'll raise our hand.

33:34.300 --> 33:35.980
I'm like, well, the rest of you guys just have a hobby.

33:35.980 --> 33:37.500
And it really makes people uncomfortable.

33:37.500 --> 33:38.220
But it's the truth.

33:40.620 --> 33:43.340
But yeah, I mean, to speak on that really, really quick, guys.

33:43.340 --> 33:48.220
For me, the thing that changed the entire game

33:49.180 --> 33:50.700
is I just sat there and looked at it.

33:50.700 --> 33:52.620
I'm like, look, there's certain things.

33:52.620 --> 33:53.980
By the way, Gabriel Ryan.

33:53.980 --> 33:55.020
Been a minute, bro.

33:55.020 --> 33:55.820
What's up, dude?

33:55.820 --> 33:56.620
Good to have you on.

33:58.860 --> 34:01.580
Gabriel Ryan is in, I think, Nashville, by the way.

34:01.580 --> 34:02.300
Just from my memory.

34:02.300 --> 34:03.580
All right, 2C, baby.

34:03.580 --> 34:04.300
What's up?

34:04.300 --> 34:09.660
Yeah, he was in Oregon, then Vegas, then Nashville.

34:09.660 --> 34:11.020
But anyway, good to see you on, Gabriel.

34:12.140 --> 34:14.540
But yeah, guys, for me, it was just like this idea of

34:15.580 --> 34:17.260
there are certain things in our life we never miss.

34:17.260 --> 34:19.020
We always find a way to sleep.

34:19.020 --> 34:22.140
Whether it's on the airport floor or whether it's in our car.

34:22.140 --> 34:23.500
We always find a way to eat.

34:24.060 --> 34:27.260
We always, well, not always, but typically find a way to shower.

34:27.260 --> 34:29.660
Even if it's like with a baby wipe, you know?

34:29.660 --> 34:30.780
Even if, whatever.

34:30.780 --> 34:33.420
So then I'm like, dude, if I took that exact...

34:33.420 --> 34:37.100
And for me, another thing that wasn't like a necessity,

34:37.100 --> 34:39.900
but I always found myself doing was going and exercising.

34:39.900 --> 34:44.700
And I was like, dude, I'm so dedicated to this.

34:44.700 --> 34:45.660
And that's great.

34:45.660 --> 34:47.820
But like, what if I took this same commitment

34:47.820 --> 34:50.780
where I never miss, I'll wake up at 3 before a vacation

34:50.780 --> 34:52.060
just to make the gym.

34:52.060 --> 34:53.900
Why don't I just take that and turn it

34:53.900 --> 34:56.140
and make it the same with my business and making money?

34:56.140 --> 34:59.980
I said, man, my business, my bank account would sure look a lot more fat.

34:59.980 --> 35:02.300
And that's what I did in 2020.

35:03.100 --> 35:06.380
It was like, if I didn't have a certain amount of closing calls

35:06.380 --> 35:10.300
every single week, I tried to go for one every single day,

35:10.300 --> 35:12.620
which obviously you have to have a lot of things going,

35:12.620 --> 35:14.700
a lot of things moving to get to that point.

35:14.700 --> 35:15.420
But that's it.

35:15.420 --> 35:16.380
It's like, how do we get...

35:16.380 --> 35:18.380
How do we ask somebody for money every single day?

35:18.380 --> 35:19.820
And if we don't, we're not okay.

35:20.780 --> 35:21.980
And that was the whole thing.

35:21.980 --> 35:24.140
And one little hack, I think I shared this...

35:24.860 --> 35:27.580
I can't remember if I shared this on here or on a WhatsApp message.

35:28.300 --> 35:31.820
But guys, a little thing that I did that was so valuable

35:31.820 --> 35:33.820
that helped me so much is in 2020,

35:34.940 --> 35:39.100
I started scheduling a sales call for Saturday morning

35:39.100 --> 35:42.300
at like 6.37 a.m. every single Saturday.

35:42.940 --> 35:45.180
And the reason why I would do it is the business owner,

35:45.900 --> 35:48.620
contrary to what you might think, the business owner actually is...

35:48.620 --> 35:52.060
That's the time they're actually getting stuff done on their business,

35:52.060 --> 35:53.180
not just in their business.

35:53.180 --> 35:54.780
They're usually undistracted.

35:55.900 --> 36:00.380
The other thing is you don't really feel like going out on Friday night

36:00.380 --> 36:03.260
if you know you got a 7 o'clock Saturday morning.

36:03.260 --> 36:05.980
So it caused me to have a really disciplined schedule.

36:05.980 --> 36:08.700
And then lastly is what a better way to start the weekend,

36:08.700 --> 36:11.100
not partying, not going out and getting drunk,

36:11.100 --> 36:14.540
but waking up at 7 a.m. and putting new money,

36:14.540 --> 36:16.220
injecting new money into your business.

36:17.180 --> 36:20.700
So anyway, that was something that really, really changed everything for me.

36:20.700 --> 36:23.260
It made me have a phenomenal weekend, got me excited for Sunday.

36:23.260 --> 36:27.020
I would give myself the rest of the day and Sunday off apart from the planning.

36:27.020 --> 36:29.500
But that was huge is just focusing on

36:29.580 --> 36:31.580
how do you get somebody to give you money?

36:31.580 --> 36:35.020
How do you ask somebody for money every single day?

36:35.020 --> 36:37.100
And if you could figure that out, you're going to make a lot of money

36:37.100 --> 36:39.020
because it's just a numbers game, you know?

36:39.020 --> 36:40.300
It is. Yeah.

36:40.300 --> 36:43.900
That's one of the major things I learned here in this group

36:43.900 --> 36:48.540
is you just have to be hitting up people for money as much as you possibly can.

36:48.540 --> 36:50.860
And then I realized that means having all the inventory.

36:52.860 --> 36:55.660
You know, got to have things moving on the back end to do that.

36:56.220 --> 36:57.580
100%, man. 100%.

36:58.380 --> 37:01.180
So for some, let's talk about somebody that's just starting out

37:01.180 --> 37:04.780
or maybe somebody that's like starting out, meaning there's no deals.

37:05.820 --> 37:09.500
Starting out, meaning, you know, maybe they've gotten distracted

37:09.500 --> 37:11.980
and they found their way back and they're like, hey, this is my year.

37:11.980 --> 37:14.540
I'm really going to give this year my all.

37:16.780 --> 37:19.900
What should they, what are some recommendations of what were,

37:19.900 --> 37:22.300
you know, some things that they should do or not do

37:23.820 --> 37:26.380
from somebody like yourself that started two years ago

37:26.380 --> 37:28.780
and in two years, for those that are just joining,

37:28.780 --> 37:32.300
has scaled up to $87,000 a month, built a software tool

37:32.300 --> 37:36.780
and is on track to absolutely obliterate those numbers this year.

37:36.780 --> 37:38.540
What's your advice for somebody that's brand new?

37:38.540 --> 37:40.540
And while you're doing that, I have got to turn down my heat.

37:40.540 --> 37:42.380
I'm sweating so bad. Keep going.

37:44.300 --> 37:48.460
Yeah, if you're brand new, I still like watch the posts of digital landlords

37:48.460 --> 37:49.740
and see people that post stuff.

37:51.260 --> 37:53.100
If you're brand new to this business model

37:53.100 --> 37:58.060
and you started in the last 30 to 45 days here in the group

37:58.060 --> 38:01.340
or started doing rank and rank in the last 30, 45 days

38:01.340 --> 38:04.540
and you're running ads and you're getting like okay performance,

38:04.540 --> 38:07.180
but not great performance and you're wondering about lead flow

38:07.180 --> 38:07.980
and things like that.

38:09.980 --> 38:13.580
If you're getting momentum in this time of year, that's awesome, right?

38:13.580 --> 38:16.860
Because it's only going to increase going into the spring.

38:16.860 --> 38:20.700
Going into quarter one is when you're going to see leads go like this.

38:20.700 --> 38:24.220
I've seen this happen every year for the last three years now.

38:24.220 --> 38:26.780
Going into the spring, the leads are going to increase.

38:26.780 --> 38:32.380
And so my word of encouragement is if you are just starting this business model

38:32.380 --> 38:39.580
and you're starting in December, you are going to see more momentum

38:39.580 --> 38:40.860
going into the spring, right?

38:40.860 --> 38:43.820
I've seen people post like, hey, what's up with lead flow, whatever.

38:43.900 --> 38:48.540
It's like, well, you've got to think about the psychology

38:48.540 --> 38:52.460
of the people who are picking up the phone.

38:52.460 --> 38:54.140
So the people who are picking up the phone

38:54.140 --> 38:57.660
and the people who need things done largely in home services

38:57.660 --> 38:59.900
is my guess is what you're still teaching in the course, Nick,

38:59.900 --> 39:01.900
is like largely in these high ticket niches.

39:02.540 --> 39:05.180
And high ticket niches means that they're going to spend a lot of money.

39:05.820 --> 39:08.780
And they're thinking right now about spending a lot of money

39:08.780 --> 39:13.500
on Christmas presents, on stuff at the end of the year,

39:13.660 --> 39:17.340
that's the psychology of the American consumer

39:17.340 --> 39:19.260
and homeowner and business owner right now.

39:19.260 --> 39:20.620
Now, business owners may be different

39:20.620 --> 39:22.860
because they're trying to get into the end of the year tax break

39:22.860 --> 39:25.260
and they're putting more into their property or whatever.

39:25.260 --> 39:29.580
But the homeowners, which can make up 80 plus percent of your leads on average,

39:30.460 --> 39:32.780
are thinking about their kids' Christmas,

39:32.780 --> 39:34.620
they're thinking about traveling,

39:34.620 --> 39:35.900
they're thinking about all of these things

39:35.900 --> 39:37.900
that are not related to their property.

39:37.900 --> 39:40.700
And then you go into quarter one and the magic happens.

39:40.700 --> 39:44.380
The magic happens when they're getting tax refunds,

39:44.380 --> 39:46.940
they're getting bonuses from the previous year,

39:46.940 --> 39:51.260
there's cash and capital infusion into a market

39:51.260 --> 39:53.500
and we're also past the election year.

39:53.500 --> 39:55.740
And so despite my growth this year,

39:55.740 --> 39:57.340
I think it could have been even higher

39:58.140 --> 39:59.740
if we were not in an election year

39:59.740 --> 40:01.500
because some of that stuff that Nick talked about

40:01.500 --> 40:04.860
with that squirrely business owner like people aren't buying, I don't know.

40:04.860 --> 40:06.140
I got a lot of that this year.

40:06.780 --> 40:08.780
I think that because we're past that,

40:08.780 --> 40:11.420
there's market confidence regardless of your politics.

40:11.420 --> 40:13.340
It doesn't matter what your political beliefs are.

40:13.340 --> 40:15.260
It's just the decision's been made, yeah.

40:15.260 --> 40:16.380
The decision's been made.

40:16.380 --> 40:19.260
It doesn't matter if you're Democrat or Republican,

40:19.260 --> 40:20.620
none of that matters.

40:20.620 --> 40:23.500
What matters is that we have stability

40:23.500 --> 40:26.060
in the sense of there is someone in the office

40:26.860 --> 40:30.060
and there's going to, every time this happens,

40:30.060 --> 40:31.740
happens every four years,

40:31.740 --> 40:33.820
there's capital infusion back into markets

40:33.820 --> 40:35.260
where money was on the sidelines.

40:35.820 --> 40:40.620
So what happens is, and this is maybe more complex,

40:40.620 --> 40:43.580
but I think this is a point worth bringing in,

40:43.580 --> 40:47.740
is that a lot of the purchasing decisions

40:47.740 --> 40:49.740
for people in this industry

40:49.740 --> 40:55.020
are made by homeowners and property owners

40:56.140 --> 41:00.620
who are always kind of the second money

41:00.620 --> 41:02.860
behind big commercial money,

41:02.860 --> 41:05.260
meaning that a lot of this big commercial money

41:05.260 --> 41:09.980
that's in private equity and commercial properties

41:09.980 --> 41:12.860
and all the growth around those kinds of things

41:12.860 --> 41:18.780
will put money into properties and rental properties

41:18.780 --> 41:20.540
and all that commercial money

41:20.540 --> 41:22.700
that comes back into the market

41:22.700 --> 41:25.020
is generally a good signal

41:25.020 --> 41:27.980
for what's going to happen in the residential market.

41:28.780 --> 41:30.220
And all that money is likely,

41:30.220 --> 41:31.900
because it happens every four years,

41:31.980 --> 41:33.340
going to come back in,

41:33.340 --> 41:34.940
and now that we're past the election year,

41:34.940 --> 41:36.540
we're past the holidays,

41:36.540 --> 41:40.780
and I think you can yell at me if you want to,

41:40.780 --> 41:43.260
but I think next year is going to be

41:43.260 --> 41:45.420
one of the biggest years for this industry

41:45.420 --> 41:48.300
because of these factors at play, right?

41:48.300 --> 41:49.660
We're past the election year.

41:50.220 --> 41:53.980
We're going into a brand new 2025.

41:53.980 --> 41:55.900
There's a lot of money that's been on the sidelines

41:55.900 --> 41:59.500
for the last year that we can all start coming back in

41:59.980 --> 42:03.180
and residential markets are going to follow behind that.

42:03.180 --> 42:07.980
And so I think the pump is primed for 2025.

42:07.980 --> 42:10.140
And so if you're in, if you just started

42:10.780 --> 42:12.780
and you're wondering about lead flow,

42:12.780 --> 42:15.180
think about what time of year it is, okay?

42:15.180 --> 42:17.020
And then realize that next year

42:17.020 --> 42:19.180
we're already primed for potentially

42:19.180 --> 42:20.940
one of the best years in this industry in a while.

42:23.340 --> 42:24.700
There's a noticeable difference.

42:25.580 --> 42:29.500
From right now, December 15th to December 31st,

42:30.060 --> 42:31.420
it can be a bit weird.

42:31.420 --> 42:33.900
By the way, don't think you can't close deals.

42:33.900 --> 42:36.780
By the way, Adair just closed the deal.

42:36.780 --> 42:38.380
Oh, I didn't even say this, by the way.

42:38.380 --> 42:41.180
Shout out to my little brother, Porter, who just hit 10K.

42:41.180 --> 42:43.740
He's been scrapping for 10K, man.

42:43.740 --> 42:48.860
He almost hit it in like a year ago,

42:48.860 --> 42:51.740
and then he got to nine and then he dropped to six.

42:51.740 --> 42:53.500
Then this year he went up to nine, four,

42:53.500 --> 42:54.940
and he's lost three deals.

42:54.940 --> 42:55.820
Some people don't know this.

42:55.820 --> 42:57.580
He lost three deals in a row.

42:57.580 --> 43:00.060
I think he was skipping steps, a little too excited.

43:00.060 --> 43:01.980
And then yesterday I got this call.

43:01.980 --> 43:03.980
I was actually on a sales call with Kyle,

43:03.980 --> 43:06.140
and I got this call and I called him back.

43:06.140 --> 43:07.500
He's like, dude, I finally hit 10K.

43:08.220 --> 43:09.420
So anyway, shout out to you, Porter.

43:09.420 --> 43:11.740
I know you've been scraping your way to get to 10K.

43:13.740 --> 43:15.340
But where was I going with that?

43:15.340 --> 43:16.380
What were we talking about?

43:16.380 --> 43:17.580
Oh, the new year.

43:17.580 --> 43:20.380
And so anyway, there's still deals right now,

43:20.940 --> 43:22.460
but what you're gonna see is from now

43:22.540 --> 43:25.420
till the January 1st can be a little bit weird

43:25.420 --> 43:27.580
with lead flow, with business owners being like,

43:27.580 --> 43:29.180
yeah, I'm taking the time off, whatever.

43:30.060 --> 43:32.620
But even though the weather is the same,

43:32.620 --> 43:36.780
generally speaking, the whole mindset shifts January 1.

43:37.500 --> 43:39.660
It's like business, because think about it, dude.

43:40.780 --> 43:42.380
The business owners you wanna work with,

43:42.380 --> 43:44.780
they're having these exact same conversations.

43:44.780 --> 43:45.500
What are we gonna do?

43:45.500 --> 43:46.780
What's our projections this year?

43:46.780 --> 43:48.220
What are we gonna accomplish?

43:48.220 --> 43:50.780
And as part of that, they need more leads.

43:50.940 --> 43:52.380
And so it's like January 1st,

43:52.380 --> 43:54.540
everyone all of a sudden is like, okay, this is my year.

43:55.340 --> 43:59.020
I see a night and day difference January 1 in the mentality.

43:59.020 --> 44:00.220
Night and day, dude.

44:00.220 --> 44:01.260
Night and day.

44:01.260 --> 44:02.380
Completely night and day.

44:03.500 --> 44:05.340
And I think that there's a trickle over,

44:05.340 --> 44:09.340
and I think it's like either they're looking for it more

44:09.340 --> 44:12.700
or they do see an increase in calls

44:12.700 --> 44:15.260
and interest from their homeowners.

44:15.260 --> 44:17.020
And sometimes holidays are up.

44:17.020 --> 44:18.860
Now let's get the house fixed up.

44:18.860 --> 44:20.620
Let's get everything tidied up.

44:20.620 --> 44:22.140
We're gonna have an amazing year.

44:22.140 --> 44:23.660
Everyone's in this new, fresh.

44:23.660 --> 44:25.420
It's such a good time of year.

44:25.420 --> 44:28.620
So guys, I know some of my Australian people,

44:29.580 --> 44:31.340
it's very weird right now.

44:31.340 --> 44:33.260
What I would recommend for you guys is

44:34.140 --> 44:36.220
if you don't wanna go run ads or whatever

44:36.220 --> 44:38.620
because you're worried that there's not gonna be a lot of leads,

44:38.620 --> 44:39.500
that's fine.

44:39.500 --> 44:41.180
Then spend the next two weeks

44:41.180 --> 44:43.260
finding your next five to 10 areas.

44:43.260 --> 44:45.820
Go and get familiar with Rank and Run Engine,

44:45.820 --> 44:48.300
the due diligence tool on Rank and Run Engine.

44:48.380 --> 44:50.860
And go knock out, the next two weeks,

44:50.860 --> 44:53.260
go knock out 300 due diligence.

44:53.260 --> 44:56.060
And go have your next 15 areas lined out.

44:56.060 --> 44:57.660
Get your ads ready to go.

44:57.660 --> 44:59.580
And January 1, kick those things on.

44:59.580 --> 45:02.700
I'm speaking for Australia because I've got this little,

45:02.700 --> 45:04.300
by the way, if you're from Australia

45:05.020 --> 45:06.300
and you're targeting Australia,

45:06.300 --> 45:07.020
send me a message.

45:07.020 --> 45:09.580
I've got a group chat specifically for Australia

45:09.580 --> 45:11.260
that I'm kind of trying to learn

45:11.260 --> 45:12.700
some of the more nuanced stuff there

45:13.820 --> 45:15.420
that I can add you to.

45:15.420 --> 45:17.660
But a lot of people there have told me

45:17.660 --> 45:19.180
it's a bit weird right now.

45:19.180 --> 45:20.700
But January 1st, everything changes.

45:20.700 --> 45:22.380
So if you're feeling a little weird

45:22.380 --> 45:24.140
or you just joined whatever,

45:25.820 --> 45:26.780
you could still get deals.

45:26.780 --> 45:29.420
But just know everything's about to change January 1st.

45:29.420 --> 45:32.380
So you got two weeks to get yourself prepared.

45:32.940 --> 45:34.860
I definitely wouldn't take my foot off the gas

45:34.860 --> 45:36.700
but just know in two weeks,

45:36.700 --> 45:39.660
things are gonna get Western as Kyle would say.

45:42.140 --> 45:43.660
Kyle by Kyle, yeah, man.

45:43.660 --> 45:44.140
I agree.

45:45.100 --> 45:47.740
I'm gonna use the word night and day difference.

45:48.300 --> 45:49.500
And I couldn't agree more.

45:50.460 --> 45:51.580
It truly is night and day.

45:51.580 --> 45:52.460
Some of these business owners

45:52.460 --> 45:54.140
are already thinking about January,

45:54.140 --> 45:55.660
but they're not actually doing anything yet.

45:55.660 --> 45:57.420
They're waiting to get past the holidays.

45:57.420 --> 45:59.420
January hits and they're thinking like,

45:59.420 --> 46:03.180
how do I grow my business this year more than last year?

46:03.180 --> 46:04.780
And then when you show up as the guy or girl,

46:04.780 --> 46:06.380
it's like, hey, I've got something to take you

46:06.380 --> 46:07.020
to the next level.

46:08.860 --> 46:09.500
They'll listen.

46:10.220 --> 46:14.620
I'm also, I've got, we've had two closing calls this week.

46:14.620 --> 46:18.060
We've got another one tonight at five o'clock.

46:18.060 --> 46:19.660
You can close deals in December.

46:19.660 --> 46:21.820
There's still deals happening in December.

46:21.820 --> 46:23.820
What I'm getting at is if you feel like things are,

46:25.100 --> 46:27.900
the momentum isn't quite where you want it.

46:27.900 --> 46:30.220
It's common is all I'm saying, right?

46:30.220 --> 46:34.380
That momentum is a different speed going into quarter one.

46:36.300 --> 46:38.220
One thing I would recommend to you guys,

46:38.780 --> 46:41.100
I know some of you that just joined,

46:41.100 --> 46:42.700
you guys probably just went through this,

46:42.700 --> 46:44.460
but for anybody that's like,

46:45.340 --> 46:47.260
that doesn't know where to start or kind of,

46:47.260 --> 46:48.540
you know, what should I do?

46:48.540 --> 46:50.860
I definitely think it would be worth you guys

46:50.860 --> 46:52.700
go and check out the video that we did

46:52.700 --> 46:53.900
that you guys are supposed to watch

46:53.900 --> 46:56.460
when you first joined called Exhausted But Satisfied.

46:56.460 --> 47:00.380
Watch that video, set your targets for 2025.

47:00.380 --> 47:02.620
And again, this isn't just financial targets.

47:02.620 --> 47:03.740
This could be any target.

47:03.740 --> 47:07.500
And then reverse engineer and break it up by quarter

47:07.500 --> 47:10.540
and by month and figure out exactly that your roadmap

47:10.540 --> 47:12.060
for how to get to that goal.

47:12.060 --> 47:13.580
And you're gonna realize as you do this,

47:13.580 --> 47:17.260
that the map to get to any goal is really not that difficult.

47:17.980 --> 47:19.100
It can be a straight line.

47:20.140 --> 47:23.180
You make it a zigzag because you get emotional

47:23.180 --> 47:24.700
and you get distracted and all these different things.

47:24.700 --> 47:27.340
But if anyone's looking for like some direction there,

47:27.340 --> 47:28.700
go and rewatch that video.

47:28.700 --> 47:30.540
It's called Exhausted But Satisfied.

47:30.540 --> 47:34.700
And go and set your targets because I know for me,

47:35.660 --> 47:38.700
I have to have that clear map to keep me on track.

47:38.700 --> 47:43.740
And admittedly, this year, I, yeah, this, this,

47:43.740 --> 47:45.820
I even think, I think I posted about this

47:45.820 --> 47:47.500
or I think I did a live about this.

47:47.500 --> 47:50.940
But we, you know, I've made, this year I made more money

47:50.940 --> 47:53.260
than I've ever made, I think.

47:53.260 --> 47:56.860
But it wasn't, because there wasn't like insane growth

47:56.860 --> 47:59.340
like there was, you know, in 2020, for example,

47:59.340 --> 48:01.420
those years always feel better

48:01.420 --> 48:03.500
because you have this, this huge growth.

48:03.660 --> 48:05.260
Even if you make the most amount of money ever,

48:05.260 --> 48:07.660
but you only made slightly more than last year,

48:07.660 --> 48:11.260
it doesn't feel near the same as going from zero to 10

48:11.260 --> 48:13.180
or from 30 to 87.

48:13.180 --> 48:16.860
And so I was, you know, in a lot of ways at my own fault

48:16.860 --> 48:19.100
because I made my road zigzag.

48:19.100 --> 48:21.500
I got distracted by a number of things.

48:21.500 --> 48:23.420
And I, you know, a lot of the stuff I blamed

48:23.420 --> 48:25.660
on personal stuff, which you can't bring into it.

48:26.460 --> 48:28.380
But I'm going back to the drawing board,

48:28.380 --> 48:30.060
back to creating my map,

48:30.060 --> 48:32.380
back to getting even more simple than I am

48:32.380 --> 48:35.180
because I've noticed I've let a lot of stuff creep in

48:35.180 --> 48:37.820
and, you know, it's about subtraction, man.

48:37.820 --> 48:38.700
That's what I've realized.

48:38.700 --> 48:42.460
So guys, we have just a few more minutes.

48:42.460 --> 48:45.340
If anybody has any questions for Ryan,

48:46.220 --> 48:48.380
as we're talking about 2025,

48:48.380 --> 48:50.060
gearing up for the best of your life,

48:50.060 --> 48:51.660
go ahead and drop that in.

48:51.660 --> 48:56.620
If not, I'm gonna go ahead and, in addition, or if not,

48:56.620 --> 48:57.660
I'm gonna go ahead and give away

48:57.660 --> 49:00.140
a little bit of swag ski on this call.

49:00.140 --> 49:03.260
So, by the way, Ryan, do you have the 10K hoodie?

49:06.060 --> 49:07.340
Is that it you're wearing it?

49:07.340 --> 49:07.820
Yeah, bro.

49:08.620 --> 49:10.060
I don't have a 10K hoodie.

49:10.060 --> 49:11.340
Oh, dude, you need the 10K hoodie.

49:11.340 --> 49:12.220
Text me.

49:12.220 --> 49:15.100
I've got the old flat feet mastery hoodie.

49:15.100 --> 49:16.620
I much love speed.

49:16.620 --> 49:17.120
Yeah.

49:19.900 --> 49:21.580
Yeah, money loves speed.

49:21.580 --> 49:22.080
Yeah.

49:22.460 --> 49:25.340
So message me, bro, anyone that's at 10K,

49:26.060 --> 49:27.420
Porter just got his as well.

49:27.420 --> 49:29.740
Well, just message me.

49:29.740 --> 49:30.860
I'll send you the code.

49:30.860 --> 49:33.660
It's completely free and you guys can get it.

49:33.660 --> 49:34.780
So, Ryan, it is cold.

49:34.780 --> 49:36.220
Let's get it before it gets warm again.

49:37.580 --> 49:39.180
Yeah, I want that hoodie.

49:39.180 --> 49:40.300
That's a dope hoodie.

49:40.300 --> 49:41.980
Yeah, dude, it's actually really soft, too.

49:41.980 --> 49:43.180
So it just goes right to your house.

49:43.180 --> 49:44.300
Be there in a few days.

49:44.300 --> 49:46.620
Okay, I want to give, because Adair closed the deal,

49:46.620 --> 49:49.020
I'm gonna give some swag to Adair.

49:49.660 --> 49:52.300
Let's go ahead and swag winner.

49:53.020 --> 49:57.900
Message Ashley for a t-shirt.

49:59.900 --> 50:03.260
All right, I'm gonna go ahead and give him.

50:03.260 --> 50:05.980
And then I gotta hook up some of my,

50:07.660 --> 50:10.860
I got a couple of my friends that are local

50:10.860 --> 50:11.740
that I gotta hook up.

50:11.740 --> 50:14.060
I'm gonna give, I gotta give,

50:14.060 --> 50:15.100
because I see them on the call.

50:15.740 --> 50:17.580
Let's see, I gotta give Mahmood, by the way.

50:17.580 --> 50:19.900
Mahmood, he's been here from the beginning, man.

50:19.900 --> 50:20.780
Mahmood's swag winner.

50:20.780 --> 50:22.060
I know you've been a swag winner before,

50:22.060 --> 50:23.420
but that's okay, I'm gonna give you more.

50:25.340 --> 50:30.140
Message Ashley, I'm gonna give Kevin, my man, Kevin Moss.

50:31.180 --> 50:33.340
Met him in West Africa, of all places.

50:34.380 --> 50:35.100
Go figure.

50:35.980 --> 50:40.460
And Mr. Kudlik as well.

50:41.500 --> 50:45.900
All right, oh, and I gotta give my friend Big Mill, hold on.

50:47.500 --> 50:50.620
All right, let's go right there.

50:52.140 --> 50:52.540
Beautiful.

50:53.660 --> 50:56.060
Okay, so Kevin Moss, message Ashley.

50:56.060 --> 50:57.740
Big Mill Dutton, message Ashley.

50:58.940 --> 51:01.340
Adair, Mahmood, if you won the swag,

51:01.340 --> 51:02.780
just message Ashley, she'll give you a code.

51:02.780 --> 51:05.660
Go to our store at shop, here, I dropped a thing.

51:06.380 --> 51:12.060
DigitalLandlords.com, and she'll give you the code.

51:12.060 --> 51:13.020
You can go right to your house.

51:13.020 --> 51:13.820
It goes right to your house.

51:13.820 --> 51:16.060
So, Ryan Dalton, dude, I appreciate you being on, man.

51:16.060 --> 51:17.100
I know you're super busy.

51:18.460 --> 51:20.620
And once again, guys, if you haven't already,

51:20.620 --> 51:23.340
go jump in, check out Rankin' Ren Engine.

51:24.300 --> 51:27.180
It is, like, with that code, it's like,

51:28.380 --> 51:31.020
with that code, what is it, like, 70 bucks, 80 bucks?

51:31.020 --> 51:32.860
$77, yeah.

51:32.860 --> 51:33.420
It's crazy.

51:33.420 --> 51:37.260
I mean, I don't, not to be that person that's like,

51:37.260 --> 51:39.020
you know, it's one dollar a day,

51:39.020 --> 51:41.980
but it's like two and a half bucks a day.

51:41.980 --> 51:43.500
Run your whole agency.

51:43.500 --> 51:44.460
Keep everything in one place.

51:44.460 --> 51:45.340
So go play around with it.

51:45.340 --> 51:46.620
Even if you guys just do a free account,

51:46.620 --> 51:48.540
to go see how smooth this thing is.

51:48.540 --> 51:49.820
Go start with the free account,

51:49.820 --> 51:51.500
but I would recommend jumping in.

51:52.620 --> 51:54.460
And that's just, that's one of the things

51:54.460 --> 51:55.740
I'm gonna use to scale this year.

51:55.740 --> 51:56.940
So check that out.

51:56.940 --> 51:58.940
There's a code if you scroll up in the chat,

51:58.940 --> 52:01.340
and let's go have the best year of our lives.

52:02.300 --> 52:02.780
Why not?

52:03.980 --> 52:05.580
Yeah, dude, for sure, man.

52:05.580 --> 52:08.060
Yeah, I'm excited about 2025.

52:08.060 --> 52:09.260
I think it's gonna be the best year

52:09.900 --> 52:11.420
in this industry for a lot of us.

52:12.140 --> 52:13.500
For everybody who's doing it,

52:13.500 --> 52:15.180
I think it's just gonna be off the rails.

52:15.180 --> 52:17.980
Like, it is crying for it.

52:17.980 --> 52:18.860
Pretty excited about it.

52:18.940 --> 52:21.180
What's your, let's speak it into existence.

52:21.180 --> 52:22.700
What's your revenue target by next year?

52:25.260 --> 52:25.980
Don't be shy.

52:25.980 --> 52:27.260
By the way, for anyone that thinks

52:27.260 --> 52:27.900
I'm sitting here going,

52:27.900 --> 52:29.180
oh, I don't want Ryan to pass me,

52:29.820 --> 52:32.700
no bigger compliment than Ryan destroying my,

52:33.900 --> 52:35.980
my highest was a 121, I think,

52:35.980 --> 52:37.660
121 to 124 in a month.

52:37.660 --> 52:38.460
It was one month.

52:38.460 --> 52:39.740
We didn't have the systems in place.

52:39.740 --> 52:40.780
We dropped back down.

52:40.780 --> 52:42.380
But I've been like an average hundred.

52:43.260 --> 52:45.180
I hope you obliterate, just so you know.

52:45.180 --> 52:46.940
And that's, I mean that from the bottom of my heart.

52:46.940 --> 52:48.620
So tell me the number now.

52:49.260 --> 52:56.300
Um, I want to be, I want to be at, um,

52:59.740 --> 53:00.860
my, my dream goal,

53:00.860 --> 53:03.340
the one I would push for is 2 million ARR

53:03.340 --> 53:05.180
by the end of 2020.

53:05.180 --> 53:07.420
But I love that.

53:07.420 --> 53:08.460
And that's my goal.

53:08.460 --> 53:08.860
I don't know.

53:09.500 --> 53:11.420
I don't know what that would be for my net.

53:12.140 --> 53:15.340
I mean, yeah, 2 million top line.

53:16.380 --> 53:17.740
Yeah, that'd be a great,

53:17.740 --> 53:18.860
that'd be amazing, bro.

53:18.860 --> 53:20.060
And it totally doable.

53:21.660 --> 53:22.700
I think it can be done.

53:22.700 --> 53:24.300
Yeah, guys.

53:24.300 --> 53:27.100
One of the reasons why being in this group

53:27.100 --> 53:28.940
and in groups like this is important

53:28.940 --> 53:29.980
is just being around people

53:29.980 --> 53:31.100
that have these big visions.

53:31.100 --> 53:32.940
And so I know some of us are sitting there.

53:32.940 --> 53:34.780
Oh my gosh, I got to get to 10K.

53:34.780 --> 53:36.620
And then we've got people like Ryan

53:36.620 --> 53:38.540
that's trying to get to $2 million this year.

53:39.260 --> 53:40.940
So when you find people like Ryan,

53:40.940 --> 53:41.740
keep them close to you.

53:42.460 --> 53:42.860
Yeah.

53:42.860 --> 53:43.420

You guys are an awesome community of people.

53:48.140 --> 53:50.780
I made probably lifelong friends in this group.

53:51.580 --> 53:53.260
Nick knows what he's talking about, you guys.

53:53.260 --> 53:59.580
Nick is the greatest resource

53:59.580 --> 54:01.180
in this industry that you could find.

54:01.180 --> 54:02.700
He does a phenomenal job

54:02.700 --> 54:05.740
of making it very relatable and understandable.

54:05.740 --> 54:07.260
And this is where I got started.

54:07.260 --> 54:09.340
I was homegrown first in AOP

54:09.340 --> 54:11.260
and then art of digital real estate now

54:11.260 --> 54:12.940
and then digital landlords.

54:12.940 --> 54:17.020
And there's so much that's possible in this industry.

54:17.020 --> 54:19.500
So thanks to Nick and digital landlords

54:19.500 --> 54:20.700
for having me on these calls

54:20.700 --> 54:22.780
and for this great community of people.

54:22.780 --> 54:24.620
Because honestly like the community

54:24.620 --> 54:27.500
is what one makes it fun to do the business model

54:27.500 --> 54:29.180
because you got people doing it with you.

54:29.180 --> 54:33.340
And you learn from people that are in the group, right?

54:33.340 --> 54:34.780
They try things and they work

54:34.780 --> 54:36.300
and you add it into your agency

54:36.300 --> 54:38.300
and you get better and they get better.

54:38.300 --> 54:42.060
And people that it's not cheap to get in here

54:42.140 --> 54:45.660
to get in this group, to be on this call ain't cheap.

54:46.220 --> 54:49.820
And you'll find that we'll pay for itself over and over

54:49.820 --> 54:51.900
and over again if you dedicate yourself to it.

54:51.900 --> 54:54.620
So thanks Nick for having a great group

54:54.620 --> 54:55.660

54:55.660 --> 55:01.180
