1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,940
So how do you know how many samples to send?

2
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,400
How many leads do you send?

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,200
Is there a specific number?

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,060
Is there a specific timeframe?

5
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,980
And honestly, the answer is probably going to piss you off a little bit because there

6
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:26,600
is no set number of leads, there is no set timeframe, okay?

7
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,560
Because it's different for every person.

8
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,600
So only thing I want to mention on this is there's no set anything, okay?

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,440
I've had customers where I have sent three leads over the course of two weeks and somehow

10
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,440
I sold the deal.

11
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,880
I've had customers where I sent five leads in one day and I sold the deal.

12
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:48,720
I've had customers where I've sent one lead in half a day and I've sold the deal.

13
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,060
Every customer is different because every customer is at a different stage.

14
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,600
Every lead that you send is different.

15
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,560
And so all I want to mention on this, because this is a question I get frequently, is how

16
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,720
many should I send?

17
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:04,600
I have a couple of rules of thumb, but more than anything, above and honestly, the rules

18
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,440
of thumb are great, but this takes precedence, is it's a feeling.

19
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,440
And you're going to know.

20
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,320
And the more that you do this, the more you're going to know.

21
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,280
They're going to start asking questions and there's going to be this moment in time where

22
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,500
the iron is hot and you need to strike.

23
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,360
And sometimes it's not convenient.

24
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:24,320
Sometimes you are going on vacation tomorrow and they're ready to talk and you need to

25
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,480
stay up late and you need to do that call tonight.

26
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,760
Or you need to get up at 3 a.m. and you need to do that call before you go on vacation.

27
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,020
And I know it's not convenient.

28
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:35,740
And I know you'd rather do it after the vacation or on your time, but when the iron is hot,

29
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:36,880
you got to strike.

30
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,040
You have to strike because that is your opportunity, okay?

31
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:45,020
And it is a feeling and we're going to get more into this, but I'm telling you that you

32
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,020
just have to feel it.

33
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,640
Their customer is going to be ready.

34
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,640
You're going to know it.

35
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,720
They're going to start asking questions.

36
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,400
They're going to say, hey, when do you want to talk?

37
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,900
Hey, how does this work?

38
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:56,060
They're going to just put off certain vibes that are going to let you know.

39
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,660
And that is going to be something you're going to learn.

40
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:02,100
It's something that you have to do rep, rep after rep after rep to learn.

41
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,680
But I do want to share my two rules of thumb.

42
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,200
Outside of that, my rule of thumb is I never try to send more than five leads.

43
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,320
So usually my rule is this.

44
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,880
I send between three to five leads or when they close a deal.

45
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,560
So if I send one lead and they close a deal, I'm getting on the phone.

46
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,060
I don't care if it's the first day and they go and close it right on spot.

47
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,860
If it's the first day I do a duck cleaning lead, they close it over the phone.

48
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,780
I am doing a deal the second they close the lead.

49
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:29,380
So the second a business owner close one of your leads, you're freaking doing the deal.

50
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:32,620
However, you do not need to wait for them to close a deal.

51
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,120
So that's something else that gets confused.

52
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,020
You're not just going to send leads and send leads and send leads for them to close the

53
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,020
deal.

54
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,020
That's not how this works.

55
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,900
The purpose isn't for them to make money so they can pay you.

56
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:46,420
The purpose is for them to see what these are like, for them to go and see the quality

57
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:49,420
and talk to the customers and see that you're legit.

58
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:53,740
So they don't even actually have to run the estimates themselves for you to go and close

59
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,740
the deal.

60
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:57,660
Sometimes I'll send three leads, they'll schedule them, but they're a bit scheduled out so they'll

61
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:02,020
schedule them for like Thursday, Friday, Monday, and I'm closing the deal on Wednesday.

62
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,660
But they've at least seen these are real customers.

63
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,980
These are people that need estimates.

64
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,300
They want estimates.

65
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,380
These are exclusive leads and that is enough.

66
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:13,460
So I just want to let you guys know the rule of thumb is I send three to five leads or

67
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,700
they close a deal.

68
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,100
quicker.

69
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,100
That's what I do.

70
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:22,300
And that's usually a telltale sign that these guys are ready to go.

71
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:26,340
And then I hop on the phone and then I get on and do the screencast and I hop on the

72
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,040
zoom call and close the deal.

73
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,580
But again, more than anything, I want you guys to know this is a feeling and it's going

74
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:32,740
to be different on everyone.

75
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,380
It's not going to be, I send three leads, I jump on the phone.

76
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,540
We have these rules of thumb.

77
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,540
We don't send more than five.

78
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:41,340
We want to send at least three, or if they close one, we have these rules of thumb.

79
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,980
But guys, I want you to trust your gut.

80
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,260
I want you to listen to what they're saying.

81
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:49,180
I want you to sense when they're ready to go, when the iron is hot, and I want you to

82
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:49,680
strike.
