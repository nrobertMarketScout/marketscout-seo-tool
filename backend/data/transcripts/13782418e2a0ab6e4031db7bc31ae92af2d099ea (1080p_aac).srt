00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,080
Go into boring niches. Go into boring niches. This goes hand in hand with what I just said.

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,800
When you get into this business model, you have to get two things right.

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:17,440
You have to get the niche right and you have to get the city right. Okay? So

4
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:26,800
why not eliminate half the work and go into a niche that we already know works, that other

5
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:33,040
people have already made money in and are having phenomenal success in? Why not cut the workload

6
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:40,320
in half and say, hey, Nick's been talking about masonry for a while. Nick's been talking about

7
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:48,560
concrete for a while. He's made lots of money in it. It fits the bill. It works. And I'm seeing

8
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:53,680
all these other people doing it. Huh, maybe I should do that too, right? Maybe I should,

9
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,480
because now I don't have to worry because guys, if you go into a brand new niche,

10
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:03,440
you have no nothing about. You have to figure out if that niche even fits this business model.

11
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,760
That might be more of a niche you need to run Facebook ads for or you need it. It's more of

12
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:16,640
like a social, like a content niche or a Instagrammable niche, right? Pick boring niches

13
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,920
and eliminate half the work.
