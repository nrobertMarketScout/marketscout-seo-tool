1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,300
Alright guys, I appreciate you being on, welcome to the call, we're gonna jump right back in.

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:12,820
I wasn't recording but now I am. Porter was just explaining about how he's trying to double

3
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:17,400
dip on one of his business owners that's already buying Concrete Leads for him, from him. This

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:25,520
is a really good hack for anybody that has multiple clients and the easiest place to

5
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:33,160
get new money or to get more money is to get money from your current business owner. And

6
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:37,640
I always used to hear this term about second money, third money, fourth money and I was

7
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,720
a little bit confused because I thought with second money, third money, fourth money you

8
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:46,720
had to go and you had to get it from, let's say you are getting lead generation money.

9
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,960
Second money in my mind was you go and get their SEO, that'd be second money, then you

10
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:55,480
go get their social media. But I also think second money is when you go and there's a

11
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,880
lot of these business owners run multiple companies, they're doing multiple services

12
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:06,520
because they have shiny object syndrome. So there's that, but more often what you'll see

13
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:13,720
is you'll find opportunities to get deals in neighboring cities. And so yesterday I

14
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:18,880
was talking to Jason, me and Jason and Porter were on Zoom and he pointed something out

15
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:25,880
that I knew, but I didn't realize exactly how, he said it really well. The thing about

16
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:34,480
the eastern United States, it seems like more in the east you find cities that aren't just

17
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:42,160
one big city and then a bunch of tiny little suburbs. You find a lot more smaller cities.

18
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:46,440
And that's what's nice about the east coast. So to give you an example, let's talk about

19
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:51,160
North Carolina. North Carolina you have Charlotte, that's a big city, but you also have just

20
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:58,640
north of it, you have Winston-Salem, you have, what else do you have, you have Greensboro

21
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,520
and you have Raleigh, I believe it is. And so those are three, and those aren't huge

22
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:10,240
cities, but you have opportunities and most businesses would cover all three. Probably

23
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,720
not Charlotte, but they might cover the other three. So that's one thing to think about

24
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,720
when you're starting to look at areas, guys, is looking at areas, yes, when you get your

25
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,120
first deal sometimes you just want to find that one that's close to home or whatever,

26
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:29,480
but if you can be strategic and find cities where there's more than one opportunity going

27
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:35,160
forward, you can, you're literally setting yourself up to get easy second, third and

28
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:41,560
fourth money. So right now it's December 10th, leads are going to be harder to come by, business

29
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,280
owners are going to be a little bit less motivated to work. I mean, if it's hard for us to get

30
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,640
out of bed, to go from the bed to put a beanie on, to come to the office, it's going to

31
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:55,000
be pretty tough for Bob to get in his truck and do some actual work. But right now is

32
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,700
a good time for you guys to go and get second money, third money, fourth money, et cetera.

33
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:05,840
So Porter, really good strategy, it's easy, they already trust you, they already know

34
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,040
you, I can't tell you, I've done this so many times, not as many times with a different

35
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,840
service, although I have done that, but a lot of times with the same service inside

36
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:20,560
of a different city. So how did you actually discover, by the way, that he did fencing?

37
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:26,240
Well, I remember last year, it was actually a little bit slower. It was seriously about

38
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:30,120
this time of year and he's like, and I was trying to prep him because I had lost business

39
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,240
owners at this point. So I was like, yeah, like the leads are going to be a little bit

40
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,480
slower in December. And he's like, yeah, he's like, we've been staying busy with, so he

41
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,280
kind of was like, yeah, well, we're okay. Like I expected that, like we're doing fencing,

42
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,720
we're doing, you know, we're still doing concrete jobs or whatever. So we kind of like mentioned

43
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,520
it, but I was like, huh, that's interesting. But it's always been in the back of my mind

44
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:52,840
to do it. But I was always hesitant because I was like, gosh dang, I don't want to, you

45
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:56,200
know, do all this work and not work out, you know, so I was always nervous, but I was like,

46
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,000
I don't know why I don't just try it. And after losing those two deals, I'm like, gosh,

47
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,120
the leads have been a little bit slow for the niches that I've been going after in the

48
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,760
area. So I'm like, let me just see if I can just get a quick, you know, quick deal. Cause

49
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,960
this guy's awesome. He, and he's like, yeah, just let me know how much it would cost. He's

50
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:15,640
like, I, I've been getting fencing jobs, like on his business card, he says he does fencing.

51
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:19,240
So every time he does like a concrete job or whatever, he'll give him his business card

52
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:23,560
and it says fencing. So he's got like three or four jobs already, just like doing fencing

53
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,240
jobs. So he's like, yeah, if you can get them to me, he says, yeah, I mean, I'll get it.

54
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,240
I'll get a crew together.

55
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,400
Well, there you go. So just like guys, go to your business owners that you, that you're

56
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,960
doing a great job for, and they will spend second money with you, third money, fourth

57
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:42,920
money. I don't recommend you to necessarily go and get money in different services. Although

58
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:49,200
if you do that, I wouldn't do the work yourself. Like if you have a strategic partnership set

59
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:54,400
up where you can take an SEO deal, for example, send it to somebody, they'll give you, you

60
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:01,040
know, 50% at least of the deal and you don't have to do the work. That's great. But again,

61
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,600
I think it's easier to get another lead gen deal. So anyway, that said, that's a really

62
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:12,000
good strategy. The other thing, guys, is just to put in a plug and to remind you guys, just

63
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,840
like the fact that we have rank and rent engine and we can do due diligence with rank and

64
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:23,960
rent engine, it's saving you so much freaking time. I, I just, I don't even know how many

65
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:30,400
hours I have spent in my life doing freaking due diligence and doing it by hand, doing

66
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,160
it on a Google sheet, whatever. And now we can literally go in. All you got to do is

67
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:40,320
you got to find the competitors really quick. Boom, you push one button and it's calculated

68
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,320
in two minutes. And if you guys haven't used it, Porter, you've, have you done due diligence

69
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,240
yet with rank and rent engine?

70
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:52,160
Yeah, it's so, I was so surprised. I was expecting to have to get out white sparks and

71
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,560
we can look at my, my citations.

72
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,720
And the beautiful part is the, the, the backlink tool is getting beefed up where you're

73
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,760
gonna be able to, you know, take a deeper dive into the backlinks. But guys, real quick,

74
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,400
if you are, I want to just share this little nugget really quick and then we're going to

75
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:13,160
get in to what the topic is today. But it's very, very easy. What I do is I have my keyword

76
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:19,400
list, I have rank and rent engine open. And then what I do is I just go clear a browser,

77
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,800
whatever, incognito mode, I have my five to seven keywords, I type them out, I add the

78
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,440
city at the end, boom, boom, boom, push for search on all five to seven searches. And

79
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:32,120
then I flip through really quick and I look at, you know, now I'm just taking a peek at

80
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,200
the organic. I don't pay as much attention to the maps, but I'm looking who's the top

81
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,240
organic person and do they show up on all five websites? If they do, or at least three

82
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:45,720
to five, three to five, if they do check the box, boom, I'm grabbing the domain, I'm putting

83
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:50,880
it in rank and rent engine. I'm doing this for the top three competitors. And I try to

84
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:56,200
exclude usually the big national players, the not the Zillow, the home advisor, the

85
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:01,080
Angie's List, that kind of stuff. I'm looking for the local people. And you put it in there,

86
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:08,080
the three websites, you push the one button, beep, and literally, it's calculated and it's

87
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:13,160
done. It's frickin ridiculous. So if you're sitting there and you guys are like waiting

88
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:19,040
for leads, not sure where to go, go look at the deals you already have and look how you

89
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,240
can turn it into two deals, three deals, four deals, those are the easiest thing to

90
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,360
do. Go get the second money, the third money, the fourth money. I promise you that's gonna

91
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:33,160
be a quick win. And nothing's better, guys, than when you finish the year on a strong

92
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:38,180
note because how you finish is how you're gonna remember the year. Even if you've had

93
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:44,360
a terrible year, even if you haven't hit your goals or whatever, if you go and just put

94
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:49,600
your foot on the gas for the next two weeks, I guess three weeks, you're gonna look back

95
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:54,360
on this year and remember it and go, man, that was a great year. I promise you because

96
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,920
I've done this with other things too, but it's how you finish is how you remember the

97
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:04,200
year or how you remember the experience. And also if you've had a phenomenal year, you

98
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:09,840
go ahead and take your foot off the gas and say, I'm gonna pack it in. That's how you're

99
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,840
gonna remember the year. It's gonna give you zero momentum going into the new year. And

100
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,080
I think it's the worst possible way to start the new year. Now, if you are somebody that's

101
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,400
been very intentional, you've said in your head, I'm gonna be taking off this week, these

102
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:26,560
two weeks to go and travel and I've earned it, whatever, that's completely fine. But

103
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,200
guys, go and get a deal. Even if you can get one more deal before the first year, two more

104
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:39,240
deals, it's the best thing you can do to jumpstart your next year. Okay? So let's go ahead, get

105
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:46,640
started real quick. And let's talk about the topic at hand. Oh, by the way, there's one

106
00:08:46,640 --> 00:09:00,320
more thing I wanted to share. Hold on. I think there's a new code. If you guys, let's see.

107
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,800
By the way, guys, do you guys like in this, dude, look at this mad pic that we got going

108
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:10,520
on here, dude. This is like three years ago. I'm looking sweet, dude. What's pick are you

109
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:18,200
talking about? Look at look at this. The the little teaser here. Check this out. Look at

110
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:23,360
Jason Jason's all fresh shaving, dude. Look at this. Yeah, that's a good Yeah, me too,

111
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,160
dude. That's like two years ago, I think. Or maybe at least it's at least a year, dude.

112
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:33,080
Freaking glow down. Just kidding. Okay, so let's get let's go ahead and get into this.

113
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:37,520
We're gonna pardon Jason off of this call. I'm not sure what came up. I'm hoping he got a deal.

114
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:41,520
He's very rarely not on these calls. But we're gonna go ahead and give him a little bit of an

115
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:46,800
excuse. Hopefully pops in at the end. If he did sleep in, you know what, we're gonna give him a

116
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,320
little bit of a slack because he's human. Okay. All right. Here's what I want to do, guys. Oh,

117
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:55,840
what I was gonna say is if you have not signed up for Rankin and Ninja, and you wish to do so,

118
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:01,160
and by the way, you don't need to use Rankin and Ninja. You can use whatever you want. Just so

119
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:07,280
you know, by the way, the way that we train this up until now has been use whatever tool you want,

120
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,800
whatever one floats your boat, whatever one frickin different strokes for different folks.

121
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,400
But it's going to be much easier for you guys if you want to use Rankin and Ninja because our

122
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:21,240
version 3.0 is going to be built entirely off of that because that's what I use exclusively now.

123
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:27,840
But if you didn't want to get that or sign up for that, you guys can message me. I have a new code

124
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:32,680
for those of you that haven't ever signed up for the 20% off for two months. Send me a private

125
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:37,400
message. I'll give you the code. So just as a heads up, Gina Benson just got into the house.

126
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:44,280
What's up, Gina Benson? Good to have you. Okay. So the reason I wanted to bring Porter on is,

127
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:48,880
and we're gonna talk about the commonalities of winners, is Porter's in a unique spot because

128
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:56,320
most of the people between him and Jason, most of the people that join our program, most people that

129
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:03,400
join this community now are going through Porter and Jason at some point. They're talking to them

130
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:09,760
on a phone call before they get on a call with Kyle. And also, for those of you that have been

131
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:15,800
in this group a while, you guys remember last year Porter was doing, he was the accountability

132
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:23,360
coach and he was jumping on calls with people who would, basically he was holding people accountable

133
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,240
and he was getting to really know the group. And we actually, there's a good chance we're gonna be

134
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,520
bringing that back because we're redoing the training and going into 3.0 and changing the way

135
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:37,640
we do everything. He's not doing that this second because we don't want to start and stop. But

136
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:42,040
anyway, I wanted to bring him on because he has a unique perspective. He's talked to a lot of the

137
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:47,640
people in this group. And so I wanted to go ahead and talk about some of the things that he's seen

138
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:55,400
that are the commonalities, and I said it in the group or as the title, the commonalities of winners.

139
00:11:55,400 --> 00:12:02,560
One of the things that all the people that are having great success have in common. And then we're

140
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,600
gonna talk about the things that people that are not having success have in common and we're gonna

141
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:13,040
kind of dissect that a little bit. I hate when people use a bunch of quotes and that, you know,

142
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:22,760
oh and so and so Napoleon Hill said this and freaking MJ DiMarco said that and you know that

143
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:29,120
bugs me. But I will say that some of these quotes, as annoying as they are, I believe that they make

144
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:36,000
sense and I've lived by them. And so one of the quotes that I heard many years ago, it was really

145
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,840
cool when I heard it because I hadn't heard it 7,000 times. But the quote is success leaves clues.

146
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:49,040
So forget about it being cliche, it's true. And it's like if somebody else is winning,

147
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:56,880
just freaking do what they do, right? If somebody's making a million dollars a month,

148
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,720
then I just need to look at what they do and I need to figure out what are those clues and the

149
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:06,400
things that they're doing that I'm not. And, and this is Hermosy that really taught me this,

150
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:12,400
what are the things that they're not doing that I'm doing? I used to think there's things that I

151
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:17,040
wasn't doing enough stuff I needed to start doing and I realized a lot of times it's the things that

152
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:22,800
I am doing that I shouldn't be doing. It's the extra stuff, you know, that I just need to cut

153
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,960
out. What do I need to cut out? So yeah, Porter, let's go through that. What's the first thing

154
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:31,520
that comes to your mind when I ask you like of all the people that you know that are successful,

155
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:37,600
that you've talked to on an accountability call, on a call before they sign up with Kyle,

156
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:45,280
what is the one, what is one thing to start that you would say most everyone has in common

157
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:53,280
out of curiosity? I would say the people that, that you're mentioning, I think they all have

158
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:59,520
this, this strong desire and like this faith that they're going to be able to make a lot of

159
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:06,000
money. Like they, they're pretty gung-ho about making it work and they're tired of the

160
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,520
circumstances they're in. Everyone I talk to, they're like, you know, I have this job, it's

161
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:13,120
not paying enough. I want the freedom. I'm not able to go on the trips. I'm not able to do the

162
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:18,480
things that I enjoy. And so that's like the number one leading motivator. I feel like for mostly

163
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:25,440
everyone is just having that, you know, that money. But I think the hardest thing from holding them

164
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:31,840
back is just their own heads that they're afraid to spend the money to make money. They're so in

165
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:37,360
their head that I have this money and I would rather go on a trip than, you know, invest in

166
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,760
myself sometimes, even though it's, it sounds stupid, but it's hard to, you know, go out and

167
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:49,520
start your own business. So Porter used a very strong and interesting word. He said the word

168
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:56,400
Whoever's read Think and Grow Rich know that that word has got to be used. I bet there's a statistic.

169
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:01,760
I bet that word's used so many hundreds of times. I'm going to ask Google how many times

170
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:12,240
is the word desire used in Think and Grow Rich? Somebody out there has, has looked this up.

171
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:23,520
Okay. No one has put, wow, hold on. I would, I would have thought that, oh, by the way, dude,

172
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:28,080
if you guys are complaining about Think and Grow Rich, you can literally go online, type in Think

173
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:34,160
and Grow Rich, and you can get the freaking PDF. So, okay, I'm not seeing any number, but I will

174
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:40,720
say that there, that thing has got to be used probably in the first chapter 50 times. Just so

175
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,600
everybody knows. The point being, though, to tap into what Porter said, guys, is that

176
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,040
I'm not going to give away Think and Grow Rich, but that's a very important word for this book.

177
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:56,080
But this is what I say, you know, I used to do all the calls when people join. I'm thinking,

178
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:02,880
I'm looking to see, Luke says it's exactly 47 times. How do you know that, bro? I trust that

179
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:08,240
that's the case, but how do you know that? I was pretty close. I said 50. Some of the people that

180
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:13,200
are on this call right now, I was the one that brought them into this group. And I will tell you

181
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:17,680
this, guys, is that you would think that the difference between the people that are crushing

182
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:22,640
it and the people that aren't is like something like they have sales experience, they have,

183
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:31,920
you know, I don't know, they're, they grew up a certain way, they, their parents are this,

184
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:37,360
their parents are not that, you know, whatever. But the truth is, guys, and I always used to say

185
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:44,480
this to people is that the people that succeed are always the ones that have the greatest reason

186
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:49,520
why they should succeed. And I would also say that you could use the word desire. And I used to always

187
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:54,320
say to people like, and this is the thing I would look for, I wouldn't get on these calls or look

188
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,880
through applications. And this is the same with business owners, by the way, but I wouldn't look

189
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:04,160
at it and go, Oh, have they had sales experience? Have they had technical experience? I would be

190
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,800
looking at someone's application. And I was looking to know, I was like, what the heck is

191
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:14,640
driving this person? What is their why? What is the reason why they want to do this? And the greater

192
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:22,880
the why, the stronger the why, the more confident I was, and the more flexible I was willing to be

193
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,040
to get them inside of the program, because I knew that they would have success. And on the contrary,

194
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:33,920
I didn't care if they were making dog crap for money, because I knew that they would start

195
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:38,320
making money if they had that strong why. And I always used to use this example. And I would say

196
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,960
this to people, I'd say, and I used to say this to business owners, this is a little one, a good

197
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:48,080
one liner or good little example you can use. When you guys are talking to your business owners,

198
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,920
you want to position it like you're almost interviewing them. Like you have a stack of

199
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:55,520
people lined up and you're trying to decide why you should work with them. This is, you got to

200
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,360
put yourself in a position of leverage. And I would always say to people, I would say,

201
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:06,000
if I asked you right now, Mr. Business Owner, or let's say I was talking to a potential student,

202
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,440
I would say, if I asked you, let's say we're at the top of a skyscraper and there's a skyscraper

203
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:17,440
across from us that's 20 yards like over into the other skyscraper. And I put a, let's imagine

204
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:23,440
there was a really strong two by four that wide going across into the other building. And I said

205
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:31,040
to you, I'll give you $10,000 to cross into that building and go across the wood. Important,

206
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:35,520
if I asked you that question, let's say we're on the 47th floor, we're in New York, we're in Vegas,

207
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:40,480
skyscraper to skyscraper, $10,000 across the two by four, two by four is going to be sturdy.

208
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,160
You're not going to shake off the two by four, but it's this thin. Would you take the deal?

209
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,080
Yeah. For $10,000?

210
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:54,640
Yeah. Dude, I don't know if I'd do it for $10,000.

211
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,840
I wouldn't. Heck no, dude. My life is way too valuable.

212
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:04,320
The downside is too valuable, dude. The downside is way too valuable. So then I would always ask,

213
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:10,240
I'd say, okay, let me change the scenario. Same exact situation, two by four, no $10,000,

214
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,720
but your daughter or your mom is in the other building and it's on fire.

215
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,280
And the only way that you're going to save them is if you get over there. Now, obviously that

216
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:23,280
probably wouldn't make sense in a real scenario because you're not going to be able to fly off

217
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:28,320
the building with them. But let's just say it solved the problem. If that was the case,

218
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,200
every single person, I imagine, unless you just hate your mom or hate your kid, which I

219
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:39,920
never really met anyone that hates their kid, but every single person, if it was $0 on the line,

220
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:44,560
but it was someone's life at risk that they really loved, they would take that deal.

221
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:52,080
They wouldn't even think twice about it. Right? Very true. Same situation, same risk, actually

222
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,880
there's no money on the line, but the Y is greater. That's the only difference. And guess what? You

223
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:06,880
are going to see people move mountains to get across there. So the point being, guys, is that

224
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:13,520
the people that are successful in this business, they have the greatest reason to be successful.

225
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,440
So here's a question I want to ask Porter. And by the way, if you guys have comments,

226
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,440
you guys have input, if you have whatever, go ahead and ask in the comments. I would love to

227
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,960
hear the feedback, but let's just say that you're somebody that's in the group or you just joined,

228
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,840
you've been in a while and you've kind of lost the reason. You've kind of lost the reason for

229
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:37,120
whatever the case, maybe it's just gone away. The desire has gone away. Maybe you've achieved

230
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:42,480
a certain level and you're not as motivated like you were. Like it's really exciting to get that

231
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:48,960
first deal, to get that first 10,000, for me to get that first million, for me to get, you know,

232
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,320
there were certain benchmarks that really got me excited. But let's say you've achieved them

233
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:59,200
and you don't have that strong Y anymore, or maybe your Y was something that was superficial

234
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,440
and it was like, I want to get that car, whatever, which by the way, isn't a very strong Y because

235
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:08,640
once you get it, then what, then what? How do you get, how in your opinion, do you acquire

236
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:17,840
that strong Y if you don't have it? That's hard because I think everyone has their own goals,

237
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,680
because I mean, you join this and maybe it's like, hey, if I get to 10,000, that's going to

238
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:25,280
supplement me enough. And like, you know, I'm not looking to make a hundred thousand a month.

239
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:32,400
It's hard to motivate that person. But what I would say is I think goals are so important,

240
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:38,160
especially like monthly goals, weekly goals, daily goals. I think if you're setting yourself

241
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:43,120
up for success and you're like, you're always checking things off the list. I know when you

242
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:47,520
set a goal out for eight months away, it's pretty hard to measure that. You need to set your long

243
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:54,160
goal and then your monthly goals and then, you know, your weekly and daily goals. But I would

244
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:58,640
just say like for me in that situation, when I've gotten stagnant and I feel like I haven't been as

245
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,680
focused, it's, I got to come back to the, I come back to the training. I start back over. I almost

246
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:07,520
rewatch the whole training again so that I can like catch this new fire. Cause every time I listen

247
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:12,000
to it, it's like, why am I not doing more of this? Whenever I land a deal and like, if I just do this

248
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,920
10 more times, I'm going to be at this point, you know? So it motivates me just to get that one more

249
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:21,120
deal. But I would say get one more deal. Just do, you don't need to get to 10 or like 20 more

250
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:27,040
thousand dollars. Just get one more deal and then one more deal. Like just keep, keep putting that

251
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:32,720
stuff in front of you. And that may work for some, but I do think goals for me is the only way that

252
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:37,280
I could ever stay motivated and think about what would my life be like if I stopped doing this?

253
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,560
And then that kind of motivates me to keep doing this, you know? Like I don't want to go back to

254
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:46,320
where I was. I want to keep growing. I don't want to lose my deals that I have. And so yeah, I would

255
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:51,200
say that would be like my motivating factor. I really like that a lot. I know that we're not

256
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:56,320
going to talk a ton about goals, but one thing that really helps, and we talked about this many

257
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:01,680
times and it's something that I did and I stopped doing and I regret that I stopped doing it, but

258
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:05,520
not just writing your goals down, but actually reading them and reading them at least twice a

259
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:10,080
day, one in the morning, one at night. It sounds stupid. It sounds cliche. It is, but it works.

260
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,160
And there's a reason why people do it. Okay. Another thing I want to mention, and this is

261
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:19,440
something that I think changes everything because some people are like not, let's say some people

262
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,880
aren't motivated. They're like, I don't know. I just don't really have that fire that I used to

263
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,760
have, or I never really had it, or I don't know how to get it. Guys, one thing that I know is that

264
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:36,160
if you get around people that are playing at a much higher level, you are by force going to

265
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:41,200
either be inspired or discouraged. And depending on the type of person that you are, some people

266
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,440
get discouraged. Some people get inspired. If you're a discouraged person by other people's success,

267
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:51,680
then that's probably indicative of your entire life. For me, when I get around people that are

268
00:23:51,680 --> 00:24:01,840
freaking crushing it and just bawling out, it shows me how small I am, how insignificant my

269
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:07,680
quote unquote success has been. And I'm like, dude, I got to freaking pick this up.

270
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:14,560
You know what I mean? When I'm thinking I'm big shot because I make a couple hundred thousand

271
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:20,400
dollars a month, and then I'm around people that are making a million dollars a month,

272
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:27,680
and I realize that, dude, I'm just to pee on, dude. These people are dropping millions of

273
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:34,320
dollars into projects and into companies and starting new companies, sometimes quarterly

274
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:39,280
with multi-million. Dude, that gets me freaking fired up and shows me how small I'm playing.

275
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:42,640
And then when I sit there and I'm with my same group of friends or I'm with a group of friends

276
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:48,240
that make me comfortable, that are a bunch of freaking screw-offs that I've known forever that

277
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,520
aren't going anywhere, or maybe they are, but they're just not going anywhere right now,

278
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:57,840
it's really easy to get complacent thinking you're the big hog on the saddle. You know what I mean?

279
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:05,280
For you, Porter, you live in Parowan, which is a great spot, it's nice, whatever, but you got to

280
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:11,360
be careful for those of you that are in towns you grew up in or around. Parowan, the downside

281
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:17,680
with somewhere like that is there's just not a lot of people doing anything. You get married to

282
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:23,440
somebody from the hometown, no beef there, as long as they're not your cousin, which happens a lot as

283
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:28,480
well. Which could happen. That's a win, but that's the biggest win of their life. I married

284
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:35,840
someone not my cousin. It's like, no, dude, no. But it's this complacency of like, dude, you got

285
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:41,680
a little house and whatever. And so you've got to force yourself to get around people

286
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:47,600
who are playing at a bigger level. Some of you guys are in situations and in cities and in

287
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:53,840
environments where it's much easier. I know when I go to Dubai, I see five Lamborghinis a day.

288
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:58,880
I realize like, dude, I'm nothing. And by the way, I'm not sure if any of that money's real.

289
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:03,600
I think it's a lot of drug money. I'm not really sure how people make money in Dubai. But nonetheless,

290
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:08,080
I'm seeing Lamborghinis. They're coming from somewhere. And that inspires me. I'm seeing

291
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:14,080
the price of a villa being $6 million. Like these things, I see that going out for dinner,

292
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:20,240
you're spending $300 every single time. And these things inspire me. And some of you guys that live

293
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,320
in cities like that, it's easier to get inspired. Some of you guys that don't, like for example,

294
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:29,520
when I'm in Freetown, it's like, you don't have to have a ton of money to be the biggest dog in town.

295
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:34,160
So you have to be careful. And it's one of the things I think can really, really help you. So

296
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:38,480
as you guys are setting your goals, you're thinking about next year, you know, one of the goals that

297
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:48,240
I have so far is I want to network with, I think I put 10 people that are making a certain amount

298
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:55,520
of million dollars per year. Like their net worth is $10 million plus. And that's one of my goals.

299
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:01,040
And there's different ways that you can do that. And there's different things that you can do.

300
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:05,920
There's different strategies that you can have. And by all means, please, for the love,

301
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,640
do not start messaging people and asking to pick their brain.

302
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:15,520
Please lunch. Hey, you want to go to lunch? You want to grab lunch and I can pick your brain

303
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:21,760
like you're doing me a favor to buy me a $7 meal. Come on. You know what I mean? You got it. You

304
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:27,920
got to think about what can you do? This is the this isn't a by the way, this isn't a live on

305
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:31,600
networking, but you got to think about what what do the people that I want to connect with,

306
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:37,760
what do they all need? And what's something that I can add value to them by doing? What is something

307
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,680
that they all would need? Because there's some people, you guys know this, have really,

308
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,560
really strong networks with high network individuals. And there's certain people

309
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:50,240
that are in certain businesses that by nature they are in, they have just amazing networks.

310
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:57,200
There's actually a student in here that just joined. And he does, he goes and he buys

311
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:03,440
exotic cars. And he has a dealer license and all this stuff. And he has he's super young,

312
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:08,400
I'm going to try and get him on. He's stud, super young kid. I think he's 21 years old.

313
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:13,280
This dude has one of the strongest frickin networks that I know he knows that all the

314
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:18,720
big players in town. He knows he is like, I bet you his Rolodex is frickin ridiculous.

315
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:24,640
But it's because he's in a business that is attractive. And again, this is there's a reason

316
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:29,200
why he's in this business because that business is not recurring. But that's something that he

317
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:34,400
does. That's like his job, right? That's his business before he got into this, where he's

318
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:41,120
something that is attractive to people with money, right? There's people that do jet charters.

319
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:46,160
There's people that are in the luxury watch business. These are all things that a lot of

320
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:51,360
wealthy people are interested in. And I'm not saying by all means, don't do not go and

321
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,880
shiny object, I'm going to start flipping watches and this and that's not what I'm saying.

322
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,320
What I'm saying is think about how you can add value to these people, start building a strong

323
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:05,200
network and start frickin getting outside of your little teeny life. One of the reasons I like to

324
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:12,320
travel is when I do my mind is blown. My mind is expanded. I look at all its levels, man,

325
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,760
and you meet some most interesting people. Like I think I told you guys this story. I met

326
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:22,560
somebody from the royal family or whatever, the oil family in Saudi Arabia,

327
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,240
looking at their car collection, looking at frickin kids 18 years old driving a yellow

328
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:35,440
Canary yellow Lambo just for fun. He didn't buy, of course. That gets me pumped and I'm like,

329
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:41,360
okay, his parents are frickin ballin out. You know what I mean? So anyway, that's a really

330
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:46,960
important point, guys. What I would do this year as you guys are thinking about your goals

331
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:54,000
is revisit your why. Revisit your why. Sit down with yourself, turn off the distractions, sit down

332
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:00,400
with a pen and paper, maybe put on some light concentration music from Spotify and ask yourself

333
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:06,880
why, why, why? What do you want is the most important and hardest question to answer in

334
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:12,320
this life? Ask yourself, what do you want? For me in 2019, I said I want $100,000 per month

335
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:18,640
and I said, why? And then I answered it. And then I said, well, why do I want, why, why to that

336
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:23,920
answer? And why did that answer? And I just tried to dig like really far down. And by doing this,

337
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:29,680
I discovered some things about myself that like how I tick, what drives me, all these different

338
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:36,000
things. And it allowed me to just like, for every time things got tough, I could just remember,

339
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,720
okay, that's exactly why I'm doing it. So anyway, this isn't about a why. So that's really,

340
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:45,840
really interesting. So basically everyone that you've seen accountability, like in these

341
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:50,720
accountability calls, on these calls before they joined, they are, they have a strong desire,

342
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:56,720
but I would guarantee it's linked to a strong why. Is that fair to say? Yeah. Okay. What do

343
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:03,920
you think on the flip side is the commonality of losers, the commonality of the people that

344
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:09,600
get in the program and, you know, within a month, they stop doing it. Within a month,

345
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,600
they're distracted. Within a month, they're messaging me. Oh, I can't find the answer to

346
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:19,760
this. Or I can't, my ads, they're just not cranking. It's like, dude, what'd you expect

347
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:24,320
it just to work perfect the first time? It's like, bro, I'm sitting over at 1.5 million,

348
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:29,600
like just relax, it's going to come through. And they want to blame everything else, every other

349
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:35,200
situation under the freaking stars, except for themselves. What is that the commonality of the

350
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:42,240
losers, bro? I would say they, I don't know what the right word for that is, but they don't,

351
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:47,040
they definitely don't take enough, they definitely don't take enough risks. They definitely don't

352
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:51,040
work as hard because I think a lot of people get in this group and they don't find the city within

353
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:54,960
the first couple of days. And they kind of are like, dude, there's just no cities. Like it's too

354
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:00,320
saturated. And they've tried, they've tried one niche, they haven't think outside the box. Like

355
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:04,160
everyone's thinking the exact same thing. And if you can't find a city, you guys start thinking a

356
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:11,520
little differently to find a city. And so I would say a lot of it's in your own head and it's like

357
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:17,600
a dumb answer, but it's so true. It's like, you guys are just so afraid to work hard almost. Like

358
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:22,560
you're afraid to give this everything you have and make this the only thing that's going to make

359
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:26,480
you money. Like you can do have part-time jobs, but you got to treat it as if this is your only

360
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:31,120
thing. And when you do that, you really start taking more seriously. Like when I was like,

361
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:35,040
okay, I'm going to make this work no matter what. And I don't care how long it takes me. I got to

362
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:39,440
deal with in the first month, you know, but it was just my mindset of like being fearless enough to

363
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,240
be like, Hey, I'm just going to spend the money. Like, I know I don't have an excess amount of

364
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,320
money. Like I'm not just going to throw it against the wall, but like, it's okay. Like if I lose a

365
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:50,560
little bit of money, it's fine. And when I had that mindset, I, you start to just piggyback off

366
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:57,920
these deals that you get. Yeah, I agree. I think another thing I want to mention really, really

367
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:04,560
quick is the people that struggle the most, they have, they have this mindset. I'm going to call

368
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:13,840
it the, if it works mindset. Okay. That's a, if this works or if this thing happens, then blah,

369
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:22,880
blah, blah. So, you know, if I'm at a thousand, if I'm at my first deal within 30 days, then I'm

370
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:28,480
going to keep doing this. You know, if this thing happens by the end, it's like this, if it's like,

371
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:34,080
no, no, no, no, no, no. If you would just change that guys, the moment that I change this, and I,

372
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:39,840
I'm trying to not sound like Mr. Frickin rah rah, because I promise you, when I get on Instagram,

373
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:49,280
when I see fricking YouTube videos and every person is now somehow a guru motivational speaker.

374
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:53,120
Have you noticed that by the way, just as a side brand real quick? Definitely feel like there's a

375
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:58,640
lot more in the last couple of years. And I want to just publicly apologize if I ever came across

376
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:03,600
like that, which I know I did. I really hope at the time I wasn't trying to be that person. I was

377
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:09,760
just passionate because I literally, last night, even some of these people that have a lot of

378
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:18,400
followers, like I was listening to, oh, what's his name, dude? Okay. It was, I found this,

379
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:24,800
I found this podcast. I was looking at my area, St. George, Utah, and there's this podcast

380
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:31,280
interviewing like, basically it's a hyper-focused podcast on St. George, Utah. And it's like,

381
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,440
because it's only focusing on St. George, Utah, their pool to pull from of interviewing of guests

382
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:43,440
is very small. And I'm looking and I know, I recognize some of the people and I'm like,

383
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:49,520
why the hell are we interviewing the fricking secretary of the local real estate office?

384
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:54,320
Like, let's have some standards. And I don't know who, I think it was this guy,

385
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,080
this other guy, I have the best account for you guys to follow. He just makes fun of influencers.

386
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:02,240
And I promise you, if he made fun of me, I would probably just share it because there's

387
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:08,320
videos he could make fun of me. But he's like, dude, you don't need a podcast, spoiler alert,

388
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:12,320
you don't need a podcast, you don't need a podcast. It's just annoying at this point. Okay.

389
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:19,040
It's very annoying. So I just wanted to throw that in there. Guys, we're not trying to be on

390
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:24,480
here thinking that we're fricking bee's knees, hot crap. We know everything. Dude, we're just

391
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,160
trying to figure this out like you guys are, but we have learned a few things. We've observed a

392
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:33,680
couple things. So I just, I'm trying to just let you know that I know how cringe some of the stuff

393
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:38,800
I probably have said. I'm just trying to be the fricking messenger. Shout out to Kanye, right?

394
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:47,920
He's the messenger. He's the espresso, as he says. But dude, in 2019, this is from experience,

395
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:54,560
not from me reading a book. 2019, I had my back up against the wall, $60,000 in debt,

396
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,480
thinking about quitting, thinking about going to be a salesperson, which by the way, no shame on

397
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:04,960
being a salesperson. But the reason why I had shame around it is because I was thinking about

398
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:11,840
quitting. That's really what it was. I was thinking about quitting. And I sat down with myself,

399
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:18,080
yellow notepad. You guys know the story. What do you want? Just shared it. And I changed my

400
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:24,160
mentality because I realized at that moment, this was the model. I had the right model.

401
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:32,400
I just needed to figure a few things out. And up until then, although I was doing it,

402
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:38,720
I still had one foot out, one eye kind of on the streets. And I was never all in. I was never

403
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:43,520
faithful. Let's just use an analogy of being faithful in a relationship. I was cheating on

404
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:47,520
my main thing. I had my eye in the streets, and I was always looking for that better thing.

405
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:53,840
And it made it so I could never succeed. I could never go all in. And the only thing that had to

406
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:59,280
happen is I had to just look at it and go, this is the right model. I just got to figure this out.

407
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:05,600
And I changed from, I remember, I got this new energy. I got this new excitement. I had this new

408
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:12,960
energy to like, this is it. I just have to do it long enough. And I have to be willing for this to

409
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:19,360
take forever. I have to be willing for me to just realize I'm going to be doing this forever,

410
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:24,320
period. And as soon as I did that, guys, everything changed. The way that I approached

411
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:29,200
my day changed. The way that I approached doing due diligence. I no longer felt like it was this

412
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,240
thing I was trying to check out the box. I was like, no, I got to master due diligence.

413
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:37,760
I started looking at my ads, and instead of being annoyed, I was like, I want to master. I want to

414
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,960
become so good at ads. I want to get a little bit better, a little bit better. I want to be able to

415
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:45,840
do them in five minutes and 31 seconds, which I used to be able to do when we were doing the

416
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:51,280
smart campaigns. And every fast of the business, I became obsessed with. And you guys know when

417
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,200
you've met someone or see somebody that's obsessed with whatever they do, and it's just contagious.

418
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:00,400
I just changed the mentality to instead of, I'm going to do it for a year. I'm going to do it for

419
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,960
three months. I'm going to do it whatever, until I'm good. I'm doing this until it works.

420
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:10,480
I just knew deep down this is the right model. And here's the advantage you guys have that I didn't.

421
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:16,560
I didn't know anyone that was doing $100,000 a month. I didn't know anyone that was doing

422
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:22,080
$30,000 a month. I saw people posting checks, but I promise you that they were lying. You know when

423
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:26,080
you can tell someone's lying when they say it and it's like, bro, how much you really making, right?

424
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:31,680
People in here making freaking $70 million a second these days, according to Instagram,

425
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:39,040
right? They're full of crap. I didn't have anyone. I didn't have Ryan Dalton making $87,000. It started

426
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:45,040
two years ago to be like, yo, if Ryan did it with a full-time job, kids and dog and jujitsu and all

427
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:50,320
this stuff, I can do it. I didn't have that, but I just knew deep down I could do it. But as soon as

428
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:56,160
I changed that, dude, everything freaking changed. I started just approaching the day different. I

429
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:59,680
started attacking the day different. I started getting up with a new zeal. I started staying up

430
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:07,520
late. I cut the Netflix during the week. Dude, everything changed, dude. All the other stuff

431
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:12,000
fell out, dude. I didn't care. I wasn't looking at other businesses. I wasn't ready to start other

432
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:17,360
businesses. That was all I had to change. That mindset shift was huge for me, okay?

433
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:28,000
Real quick, I want to talk about this as well. What do you think? This could be from people you've

434
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,520
talked to, people you've interacted with, but I think that one of the issues nowadays is that we

435
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:39,280
try to add all these extra things. We try to add... I got to do... And this is an extreme example. I'm

436
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:44,240
not trying to steal from Formosy or any of these guys, but they do a really good job making fun of

437
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:53,040
it. The cold plunge and this freaking one-hour routine and the meditation and the affirmations

438
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:58,480
and all this different stuff. I think it was a really fresh idea when Formosy was like,

439
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:06,720
you could also just wake up and walk into your office and work. That also works. Anyway, by the

440
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,520
way, I got nothing against cold plunge. I actually think it's rad. I just don't think you need to

441
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:14,800
post about it. That's it, okay? For the record, Ford, I know you got a cold plunger, but don't

442
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:20,720
be hiding that from anybody. Dude, consistently, dude. It's good for the joints. Dude, I would do

443
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:26,400
that. I'm all for the cold plunge. The point is, don't think that you need to do cold plungers to

444
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:32,560
make $10,000 a month, $50,000 a month. What I want to talk about really quick are what are some of

445
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:39,440
the things that you see people, they have a misconception about, what are some of the things

446
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:45,680
that people think they need to be doing that are just distractions, right? That's another thing

447
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:53,120
that I went... The years that I've really grown, dude, are the years where I sit there and I think,

448
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:58,400
what can I eliminate? That was another huge thing for me. I know we're talking about the

449
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,560
commonalities of winners, but I'm going to put myself in that. I've got to observe myself,

450
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:08,080
retrospectively, looking at that. One of the things that I did, and I've shared this before,

451
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:14,160
is I cut all the BS. I eliminated, I simplified, I simplified, I simplified.

452
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,480
I'm going to share some of the things that I simplified, but what do you think, Porter,

453
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:24,880
are some of the things that people, from what you've seen, need to simplify in their life,

454
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:33,520
need to get rid of to have the success to become a winner? Guys, it's ridiculous to know. If you're

455
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:40,720
watching this call right now, and you know that Porter's at $9,400 a month, and he's also farming

456
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:44,960
full-time, and you're not at five, you're not at one, you don't have a deal, and you've been

457
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:50,800
doing this for anywhere close to the same amount of time, that should really piss you off. It should

458
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:56,080
inspire you, and it should piss you off. No way, dude. No way I'm letting Porter do this, and I'm

459
00:41:56,080 --> 00:42:00,160
not. You know what I mean? I used to do this about people as well, dude. It's good to have people on

460
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:04,880
your radar. Anyway, Porter, what do you think are some of the things that people need to cut out

461
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,240
that they're doing that they shouldn't be doing? Because we always talk about what you should add,

462
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:13,920
routine, 10 pages of a book, gallon of water, cold plunge, this pill, that pill, freaking

463
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:20,160
grounding, sun on the face, dude, watching Liver King, listening to Joe Rogan, like all the freaking

464
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:25,840
cliche stuff that all of us do, but some of us think that it's necessary to have success.

465
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:30,000
What are some of the things we need to cut? Again, observing other people. We're not being

466
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:36,640
influencers here. We're not being Tony Robbins here. We're just observing. We're just country

467
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:42,880
folk that are observing. Dude, I don't know if it was just me, and I guarantee if I say this,

468
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:50,320
if this is you, comment below, but how many times do you think you have to have this mile-long list

469
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:56,000
the next day? I would sit down and I would write and I would write down the most small things that

470
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:02,800
would not do anything to get me closer to moving the needle. It would be like doing due diligence

471
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:07,200
or like, I mean, that was, but like at the time I was doing so much due diligence that I wasn't

472
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:13,680
acting. I wasn't actually taking initiative. So I think simplify your list. And if you do a list,

473
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:18,240
if you do it to do list, pick three things or pick big things that you're going to be able to

474
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:21,840
do and just do them because you're going to get them done a lot faster. I would say,

475
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:26,800
eliminate social media. Like during your work, when you're working, I found that I look at my

476
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:32,160
phone a lot when I'm on my computer, I'll have my phone sitting and I'll be on computer. And if I

477
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:36,480
don't like set a timer or something to try to work for a certain amount of time. And I know

478
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:40,640
Hermosa does that. And he says, every time you get distracted, if you pause your timer,

479
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:45,520
you'll actually realize that you can do the same task in half as much time. And I'm like,

480
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:49,600
so the other day I was doing, I was setting up a campaign and I was kind of dreading it because I,

481
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:53,920
sometimes I have to go through, look at the training, you know, go back and forth.

482
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:58,720
And I really sat down and just did it. And it literally took me 15 minutes. And for whatever

483
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:02,960
reason, I thought it was going to take me an hour or whatever. It was 15 minutes and I got so much

484
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:07,920
done. And it just took getting started for me to realize like, what am I doing? Like this is,

485
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:13,520
this is so simple, but I had to create, I create these long lists. So I think that I need to start

486
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:17,680
checking things off. And naturally you want to go after the smallest things possible because it

487
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:21,600
makes you feel good. It's like, make your bed. It's like, go to the gym. It's like, read, read

488
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:25,280
a book. And those are things that are pretty easy to do and you can check it off, but they're not

489
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:30,960
really getting you closer to your goals. So I would say for me, and I don't know most of you,

490
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:37,440
probably simplify your list, get rid of social media and just realize that it doesn't take you

491
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:42,000
as long as you think to get stuff done. That's a really, that's a really strong point.

492
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:47,600
And by the way, as you said that, Sean said, my biggest waste of time was doom scrolling. I deleted

493
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:52,720
TikTok and Instagram at seven AM this morning. Yes, yes, yes. And yes, guys, one of the things

494
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:59,280
that I do and I, I, I'm not perfect at this. And sometimes I catch myself like going a few days

495
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:03,120
and realizing, oh my gosh, I wasted a bunch of time. Even at, even where I'm at, I still catch

496
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:08,320
myself doing this. But one thing that I think is very important is to get, just get social media

497
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:15,040
off your phone, get it off your phone, turn it on to post, delete it, and then give yourself a

498
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:20,160
certain time every day where you can go and you can feel, you can not feel guilty by just scrolling

499
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:24,720
and just kind of unwinding if you want. Okay. But literally you got to set a 15 minute timer.

500
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:31,040
So what I try to do again, try, because I didn't even do this yesterday admittedly, but I did a

501
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:37,440
pretty good job last week is I delete it. It's deleted all day. And then I have this little time

502
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:42,080
timeline where I want to get on and post. I don't even write my post on Instagram.

503
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:48,640
I write my post in the notes app. And I also think of which stories I want to share

504
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:54,320
on my thing. So then what I do is I download Instagram, I copy and paste, I put the picture

505
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:59,600
in, I paste the, the, the, whatever the body of the text. And then I put the location, boom,

506
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:06,000
I post it. I go share a few stories. And within 20 minutes, I can have a nice post, all my stories.

507
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,960
And then guys, if I just delete it right after, cause I know some of you guys, it's so tempting

508
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:16,960
to sit there and go, who liked it? I wonder how cool they think I am. Like, let's be honest,

509
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:21,920
we've all done it, dude. Who's looking at my story? You don't pour it on admit you haven't done that

510
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:28,640
last week, dude. We all, we all, we're all guilty of it. Stupid dude. Like that gets us anywhere in

511
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:32,400
life, but we all do it. Right. And you're just sitting there and you're waiting for a little

512
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:38,880
freaking comment. And it's like, dude, you know, it's interesting. Just delete it. And then you go

513
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:43,440
in to make your post the next day, make your post, and then give yourself an extra five minutes to

514
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:50,320
read the comments and be like, Oh, I looked at who liked it in 15 seconds. I replied to the one

515
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:56,320
comment I got. Thanks mom. And that's it. And I just saved myself, not only the time of scrolling,

516
00:46:56,320 --> 00:47:00,160
but the distraction of every single time. Oh, wonder who texts me. I wonder if they're following

517
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:06,240
me back. It's like, dude, freaking come on guys. Okay. I'm speaking to myself. So true.

518
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:09,760
It's freaking happened. By the way, Sean said I give props to TikTok because it's how I found

519
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:14,480
the program. I just don't need it now. Yeah. A hundred percent. But by the way, when you do your

520
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:19,840
15 minutes, if you guys assume to do 15 minutes a day as of consuming, there's different levels of

521
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:23,920
it. Like there's stuff you can add value. I like to go and like listen to Theo Vaughn cause he's

522
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:28,960
freaking hilarious. Um, that's to me, that's value. That's entertainment. I'll take that over

523
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:33,520
Netflix. But also I think there's some interesting stuff like you can find on some of these

524
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:37,760
platforms and you don't just sit there and like consume or, you know, inspiring, interesting

525
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:43,360
educational. So there's different levels, but guys, let me just share this. Um, in 2020,

526
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:46,320
when I scaled up to a hundred thousand dollars a month, let me share some of the things I did.

527
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:52,560
Okay. Is social media. I basically just got rid of it. Okay. Like I don't even, I don't even know

528
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:56,720
if I posted. I'm sure I did, but I don't think I posted much. I don't think I consume much. I was

529
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:02,000
just tired of being broke. I got rid of that for the most part. Um, but more than that guys,

530
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:07,680
I got rid of a bunch of the things that you, they're, they're the silent killers.

531
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:14,400
Let me give you an example. Lunches with your, but with your business buds. Okay. I was because if

532
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:19,200
you guys work in an office, it's really easy to be like, dude, let's go meet for lunch, blah, blah,

533
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:24,080
blah. And guys, you, it takes two hours to meet for lunch. Like it just does. You got to drive

534
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:28,080
there. That's 10 minutes, 15 minutes, depending on where you live. You're going to order your food.

535
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:32,000
You're going to want to talk. It's going to be about an hour. Then you're going to do another

536
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,240
15, 20 minutes, get back to the office. And of course you got to grab you a soda, right? Pour

537
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:40,720
a little swig ski on the way back. There's another 10, 15 minutes. Then when you get in the office,

538
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:44,800
you got to chat, right? Jessica's at the front. She's got to ask me a question where I'm asking

539
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:50,400
her when she's going to Italy, dude, I'm two hours of my day to go and get lunch with somebody.

540
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:55,760
So in 2020, it helped that there was nowhere open, of course, at the beginning of the year,

541
00:48:55,760 --> 00:49:01,040
because, you know, what restaurants were closed, there's only takeout. But even after things

542
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:08,320
started opening up, I just didn't do it. Okay. So I got rid of the BS lunches. Number two is I got

543
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:13,440
rid of all the hobbies. And I'm not saying that you need to do this and be fanatical forever,

544
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:18,720
but if you guys are not where you want to be, if you guys are not free or, and especially if you

545
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:24,240
haven't gotten your first deal, guys there that you can have a season of your life where you just

546
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:29,840
go locked in. You kind of do that. Like people call it monk mode or they go away in the wilderness

547
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:34,320
for a while. But if you just got into this program, you don't have a deal. I highly,

548
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:39,760
highly, highly recommend that you guys eliminate as much as possible. Not that it needs to be

549
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:46,800
forever, but for a season of my life, I did not do golf. I did not do pickleball. I did not do

550
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:52,800
fricking basketball. Only thing I did is I went to the gym because that helped me with my business.

551
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:58,640
But I got rid of everything else. Okay. Another thing I got rid of is I got rid of watching

552
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:04,800
Netflix. Okay. I, by the way, I got rid of watching Netflix during the week, Monday,

553
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:09,840
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday night, Saturday night, I can watch it. And boy,

554
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:15,760
did I watch, I blew through seasons, dude. I was times I woke up, I was like, dude, it's 4 30 AM,

555
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:22,560
dude. Eyes wired like I had taken, you know, five packs of Marl bros. I had a Zen in each

556
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:28,800
little pouch, dude, watch it. Just, I would hit seasons, bro. But at least it was,

557
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:33,840
it was very channel. Okay. Nothing during the week. Nothing's messing with my week. Okay.

558
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:39,200
Further than that, I kept eliminating. I got rid of all the extra services. I was done with SEO.

559
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:43,360
I was done with fricking social media management. I got rid of all of that.

560
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:48,640
Then I got rid of all my extra niches and I dialed in on one niche and I'm like,

561
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:52,080
I'm going to go one niche and then I'm going to sell these other websites that I,

562
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:59,040
that are generating leads. I got rid of all of my deal structures, paper lead gone, commission

563
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:04,160
gone. It was never really there anyway. Only flat fee. I got rid of all my pricing options,

564
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:08,880
a thousand dollars plus. I got rid of all my contract options. It's one six months at the

565
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:14,240
minimum. That's it. Boom. And guys, I had such a simple life. I would wake up,

566
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:21,200
gym was closed. Luckily my buddy, about a block away invited me. 7 a.m. I'd be at his gym.

567
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:29,280
We would work out for one hour. I would come back and get to work. I would work. I'd have

568
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:35,040
some lunch midday. I'd work some more. I'd be at the kids two, three hours. They'd go to bed.

569
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:41,440
I'd come back up to the office and that's it. And guys, in my work, like Porter said,

570
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:48,800
it wasn't fricking stupid stuff. Checking boxes. It was literally make calls, find new areas,

571
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:53,760
hook new business owners, close deals. Like that's what I focused on and everything else,

572
00:51:53,760 --> 00:52:00,080
find someone to do it. And what do you know from 2019 December, eight to 10,000 bucks a month,

573
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:03,520
July, 2020, a hundred thousand dollars a month. No coincidence.

574
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:09,680
Simplicity is more simple and more. Yeah. Less is more. More is less. 100%

575
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:14,000
Gina says, I'm totally guilty of using Instagram, especially as a distraction,

576
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,120
beating myself up right now, along with you right now. It's such a waste of time. I get so much done

577
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:21,680
when I had my phone. Yeah. And guys, I think if you're intentional about it, like give yourself

578
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:25,840
some time, maybe if it's 30 minutes at night, say, Hey, every night when everything's done,

579
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:30,720
I plan my day. I would recommend not doing it in bed, but like, I'm going to give myself 30

580
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:35,200
minutes. Maybe sip on your fricking nightly lemon and ginger tea with a little drop of Manuka honey.

581
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:41,600
That'll put you to sleep. That'll put you on your behind. While you're doing that,

582
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:46,880
you give yourself 30 minutes, 15 Instagram, 15 TikTok, and then delete the apps. Okay.

583
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:51,680
And I promise you when you wake up and you don't do fricking check your phone on who liked my post,

584
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:54,560
you're going to get a lot more done, but Gina, don't beat yourself up. We all do it. I fricking

585
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:58,880
did it yesterday. It's just one of those things we've got to remind ourselves. Jason says,

586
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:01,920
setting up a separate device for social media and removing them entirely from the device I

587
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:06,240
carry all day and the process that I speak. I love that. You know, when I shared this last thing

588
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:13,600
in 2022, I did this, this worked for a period of time. I don't know why I stopped doing it.

589
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:17,520
Maybe I should do it. And this isn't something that's necessary, but I actually went and got

590
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:23,520
a completely separate phone, separate number, everything. I actually got this from dad because

591
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:27,920
he does it too, or he was getting a bunch of calls from his church stuff. But I had this little

592
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:33,040
fricking tiny, I had another, it was a smartphone, but it was the little tiny one and it was a

593
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:39,040
different number and it had nothing on it and no one had my number. That's it. The only one that

594
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:42,720
had my number. I didn't even have it. You didn't have my number. My wife had my number in case

595
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:46,880
there was emergency. I think, I think, I think my dad and mom had my number. I think there was like

596
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:51,440
three people that had my number and guess what? That was the phone I used during the day. So I

597
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:58,160
knew that there was no emergencies happening, but I was, I was locked in, baby. I was locked in.

598
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:02,480
So again, that's an extreme example. If you, you can do that, but you don't need to do that. You

599
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:09,040
can also just not look at your phone. You can also just fricking turn it off. And that's it. And if

600
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:12,160
you have a spouse or a significant other that doesn't understand that you need to have a serious

601
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:15,680
talk, cause it's like, dude, we're making money during the day and then I'm going to be with you

602
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:23,360
at night. Okay. That's it. So guys, I hope you guys are excited as I am about 20 fricking 25.

603
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:28,800
We have another year ahead of us. We have, we have, we can, we can set new goals. We can go

604
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:34,080
achieve new things. This can be the year and you guys, your whole life can change in a year. You,

605
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:39,120
you can go from being somebody that's just getting by, having to calculate every time you take a

606
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:45,600
flight to literally owning the car of your dreams or owning an apartment complex that makes you

607
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:50,880
a certain amount of money. You guys, these are like, there's so much possibility and it's

608
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:55,120
fricking insane how much your life can change in one year. We have a new year ahead of us.

609
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:59,760
Let's not end this year. Just take our foot off the gas, but let's, let's, let's go strong and

610
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:04,000
let's get our goals done now. Let's not wait till January 31st or December 31st to have our goals.

611
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:07,440
I hope you guys are pumped. I hope you're excited. We have things that are making this

612
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:13,840
easier. We have people to show us Ryan Dalton, myself, you know, Mike V, some of these big

613
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:18,000
players that are making a lot of money that we can look to as examples, look at them for inspiration,

614
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:22,960
look at them for wisdom, look at them for what to do, what not to do. And just go and eliminate

615
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:26,240
everything and let's go and fricking do it. By the way, we also have tools that are helping us

616
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:31,840
rank and run engine, which again, I'll just quickly, if you guys do not and have not already

617
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:35,760
messaged me for a discount code, if you haven't used one of those already, there's a new code

618
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:42,320
that Ryan set up. That, that can get so much more work done in such a shorter period of time,

619
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:46,480
just with the due diligence feature alone. So we have all these things, all these examples,

620
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:49,760
all this support. We're going to be coming out with a new version of the training that's going

621
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:54,080
to help us even more with accountability and everything else. A lot of exciting stuff. This

622
00:55:54,080 --> 00:56:01,840
is the greatest business model on the fricking internet, guys. Let's see. Jason says, so how

623
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:05,680
many carriers these days give away a free phone with new lines and lines are cheap to add?

624
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:11,920
That's so true, dude. It's actually really true as you can easily do that. Freedom of time.

625
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:17,200
Leanne says the Opal app blocks anything you want for whatever hours you choose. That's dope.

626
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:23,360
That's a good little hack ski. Thanks, Leanne. I like that Opal. Also, if you guys don't already

627
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,400
do that, what's this app that I've had on my desktop for however long the,

628
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:31,920
hold on, I'll tell you exactly what it is. It's called the

629
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:45,360
the News Feed Eradicator. News Feed Eradicator. I can't even, like if I go to Facebook because

630
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:51,360
I have to be on Facebook, I can't see my timeline. It gives me some cheesy quote.

631
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:56,080
I can't see anything. I'm not scrolling because you guys know how easy it is to get it. And by

632
00:56:56,080 --> 00:57:01,760
the way, Jason just said, oh yeah, brick too. By the way, if RIP, if RIP can use a brick phone,

633
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:09,120
Porter? With a flip phone, dude? You can do a flip phone and your stuff is bad freaking RIP,

634
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:13,040
you can use a flip phone. Dude, a flip phone's a vibe, dude. I'm going to go back to a Blackberry

635
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:17,680
at the very minimum. But yeah, Luke says plus one for the News Feed Eradicator. Guys, appreciate

636
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:21,120
you hopping on. Porter, thanks for hopping on. Sharing some nuggets. Hopefully we didn't come

637
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:27,200
across a bunch of freaking guru Tony Robbins wannabes. We're just a bunch of, like I said,

638
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:33,520
country boys with some moderate to crappy education that just are trying to be simple,

639
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:38,880
trying to make money, trying to make a little dent in this world. And hopefully you guys got

640
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:41,680
some value from this. So guys, appreciate you being on. Porter, thanks for being on.

641
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:43,760
We'll see you guys next time. Yeah.
