1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
But something that Linda said kind of stuck out to me more than anything else is she shared

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,000
a story, if you guys haven't watched that interview, it's an awesome interview.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,160
She shared a story of a business owner that she was going back, she was doing the process

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,160
with, right?

5
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:20,120
She was going, everything was going good and she was supposed to do the Zoom call later

6
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,120
that day.

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,160
In fact, I think it was the same day, I think it was Thursday before the call.

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:31,400
This business owner hit her up, like many of these business owners do, and said, hey,

9
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,400
can we actually just reschedule the call, right?

10
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,040
Can we reschedule the Zoom call, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, which is what a lot of them

11
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,280
will do.

12
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,640
Linda said that she's had a tough time in the past, but she's like, I'm tired of getting

13
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,960
walked on.

14
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,720
I'm tired of people yanking me around.

15
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:57,240
She literally told the guy, she's like, I'm working exclusively with one company.

16
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,720
I'm interested in working with you.

17
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:03,560
I think her exact phrase was like, if this is important to you, we need to talk today.

18
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,080
We need to talk today.

19
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,360
Because she was bold and she meant it and the guy knew she wasn't messing around, the

20
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:14,880
guy rescheduled, which we don't know if he actually had something or what, it doesn't

21
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,000
matter, but he rescheduled whatever he had that was keeping him from that call.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,320
He pulled over, they did the call, and she inked the deal.
