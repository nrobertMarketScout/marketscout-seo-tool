WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Okay, and by the way, guys, you can all hear me, right?

00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
Yeah.

00:08.000 --> 00:09.000
Cool.

00:09.000 --> 00:10.000
Awesome.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.000
Let's do this thing.

00:11.000 --> 00:12.000
Let's guys today.

00:12.000 --> 00:13.920
I want to talk about low ticket versus high ticket.

00:13.920 --> 00:18.280
First of all, I want to let you guys know what I'm going to do is anybody that's watching

00:18.280 --> 00:21.640
this entire call that's on this the entire time.

00:21.640 --> 00:25.240
We are going to just like last time, we're going to screenshot your name and we're going

00:25.240 --> 00:26.240
to send you.

00:26.240 --> 00:31.880
We're going to take all the information that we have in this presentation and distill it

00:31.880 --> 00:37.040
down to something that's like consumable, like some type of a digital resource, whether

00:37.040 --> 00:42.320
it's a list, whether it's a whatever the case is, Aaron's going to create it and everyone

00:42.320 --> 00:46.080
that stays on this call the entire time is going to actually get that resource.

00:46.080 --> 00:50.560
Okay, so just stay on and then you don't have to worry like we will give it away to a couple

00:50.560 --> 00:53.600
people in the free group, but you guys don't have to worry about like commenting and stuff

00:53.600 --> 00:54.600
like that.

00:54.960 --> 00:58.160
So just so you know, that's kind of the thing that we're going to do to incentivize you

00:58.160 --> 00:59.160
guys.

00:59.160 --> 01:00.160
We want we want you to stay on.

01:00.160 --> 01:05.560
Okay, so one thing that I realized this week as I was preparing for this and I was I was

01:05.560 --> 01:13.440
doing my own education for myself, I realized that sometimes I assume that everybody knows

01:13.440 --> 01:17.240
who I am, you know, like they know my entire story.

01:17.240 --> 01:20.640
And because I've said it so many times, it becomes very boring to repeat.

01:20.640 --> 01:24.400
But I want to just quickly, I basically want to just let you guys know if you're new to

01:24.400 --> 01:29.720
this, if you're new to this group, you're new to this, this space, rank and rank digital

01:29.720 --> 01:34.360
real estate, I want to like give you a reason to consider listening to me.

01:34.360 --> 01:37.840
Okay, I don't think you should believe everything that I say or anything that I say, I think

01:37.840 --> 01:38.840
you should test everything.

01:38.840 --> 01:43.640
But I want to give you a reason to consider listening to what I have to say.

01:43.640 --> 01:48.160
So quick background, 2016, I was knocking door to door.

01:48.160 --> 01:49.160
I was tired of it.

01:49.160 --> 01:50.440
I needed something that was online.

01:50.440 --> 01:51.440
I wanted to travel the world.

01:51.440 --> 01:54.280
By the way, here we are in Dubai doing exactly what I wanted to.

01:54.280 --> 01:55.560
It's amazing.

01:55.560 --> 01:57.560
I wanted something that was recurring.

01:57.560 --> 02:02.100
I wanted to be able to have a life for my family, my kids and give them experiences.

02:02.100 --> 02:06.160
And so in 2016, I got into this game.

02:06.160 --> 02:10.240
I took my own advice that I give it and I found somebody that had a program and I did

02:10.240 --> 02:13.560
the call and the whole thing, not even thinking I was getting sold.

02:13.560 --> 02:18.580
And sure enough, I got sold and yeah, it was a thing between me and my wife.

02:18.580 --> 02:22.120
She wasn't super excited about it, but I made a lot of money from it.

02:22.120 --> 02:25.160
So I always remind her that I made a good decision.

02:25.160 --> 02:27.720
So I've been in the game for eight years.

02:27.720 --> 02:31.280
There was a little hiatus in there where I got some shiny object syndrome.

02:31.280 --> 02:34.920
I tried to start a software company, but I've been in this game for eight years.

02:34.920 --> 02:42.840
I've also spent and lost millions of dollars making mistakes, including at one point four

02:42.840 --> 02:43.840
or five million dollars.

02:43.840 --> 02:47.520
And I think it's a little bit higher than that now just on ads.

02:47.520 --> 02:48.520
And I did that.

02:48.520 --> 02:51.360
And the reason why I have this group is so that you guys don't have to, you don't have

02:51.360 --> 02:53.880
to go make the one point four or five million dollar lessons.

02:53.880 --> 02:56.040
I can teach them to you.

02:56.040 --> 03:01.680
OK, so eight years in 2020, I finally figured it out.

03:01.680 --> 03:03.160
There was some missing pieces.

03:03.160 --> 03:05.840
That program that I was in, it was good, but there was missing pieces.

03:05.840 --> 03:09.400
There just there was a lot of stuff that just these little things.

03:09.400 --> 03:12.120
And finally, in 2020, I was able to scale.

03:12.120 --> 03:13.120
I figured it out.

03:13.120 --> 03:14.120
I nailed it.

03:14.120 --> 03:19.640
And we went from eight thousand dollars a month in December of 2019, where I just about

03:19.640 --> 03:20.640
walked away from the model.

03:20.640 --> 03:23.920
I just about decided, hey, I'm just the sales guy.

03:23.920 --> 03:26.560
I don't know if I'm cut out to be an entrepreneur.

03:26.560 --> 03:27.840
Maybe I should just go sell for somebody else.

03:27.840 --> 03:29.520
I was this I was this close.

03:29.520 --> 03:33.840
I even had the deal in place, the commission, the company I was going to sell for.

03:33.840 --> 03:36.520
And I looked at my goals and I wanted to make one hundred thousand dollars a month.

03:36.520 --> 03:42.160
And I started to realize I'm like, Nick, you're never going to get there by doing by going

03:42.160 --> 03:43.160
and selling for somebody else.

03:43.160 --> 03:44.160
You just can't.

03:44.160 --> 03:45.160
It's just it just doesn't work.

03:45.160 --> 03:46.160
Right.

03:46.160 --> 03:47.160
OK.

03:47.160 --> 03:48.160
Yeah.

03:48.160 --> 03:49.160
Maybe there's someone that sells commercial real estate at a brokerage.

03:49.160 --> 03:50.160
OK.

03:50.680 --> 03:52.880
For most people, it's impossible.

03:52.880 --> 03:58.280
And so I luckily I doubled down, tripled down, got really focused and said, I'm going to

03:58.280 --> 03:59.280
sit in this.

03:59.280 --> 04:00.280
I'm going to figure this out.

04:00.280 --> 04:03.200
And I changed my mindset from I'm going to try this for a year.

04:03.200 --> 04:04.200
I'm going to try this for a week.

04:04.200 --> 04:05.200
I'm going to try this.

04:05.200 --> 04:09.920
And whatever I change it until I change it to, I'm going to do this until it works.

04:09.920 --> 04:10.920
And I don't care if it takes five years.

04:10.920 --> 04:12.220
I don't care if it takes 10 years.

04:12.220 --> 04:13.220
This is the model.

04:13.220 --> 04:14.220
And so we went from it's funny.

04:14.220 --> 04:17.520
As soon as I got I switched that as soon as I got focused and I got rid of all the other

04:17.520 --> 04:21.120
side businesses and everything else, I went from eight thousand dollars a month in twenty

04:21.120 --> 04:25.520
nineteen December, July of twenty twenty, we did one hundred thousand dollars per month,

04:25.520 --> 04:30.720
one hundred percent of that was Legion, zero SEO, zero consulting, zero side business money.

04:30.720 --> 04:31.720
That was all from Legion.

04:31.720 --> 04:35.080
And it and it was it was interesting.

04:35.080 --> 04:36.080
I didn't even know.

04:36.080 --> 04:37.640
I just I could just feel the momentum.

04:37.640 --> 04:39.280
I didn't even know we were doing that well.

04:39.280 --> 04:41.800
So that was in twenty twenty twenty twenty one.

04:41.800 --> 04:45.600
We did one point four or five million dollars of top line in just my agency.

04:45.600 --> 04:47.360
That doesn't include, you know, my program.

04:47.400 --> 04:49.920
This was just in my agency.

04:49.920 --> 04:52.960
And I know that because I remember looking at it and going how much of this was and I

04:52.960 --> 04:55.360
think we made a little bit more than that because we just launched.

04:55.360 --> 05:00.280
So in twenty December twenty twenty one, we launched digital landlords.

05:00.280 --> 05:04.160
And the funny thing is, I use the exact same strategy, the same scripts, the same techniques,

05:04.160 --> 05:08.760
the same everything that I teach in the program to sell the program.

05:08.760 --> 05:13.400
And we launched it in December twenty twenty one in the very first year, twenty twenty

05:13.400 --> 05:14.400
two.

05:14.400 --> 05:16.920
We also did another seven figures with the program.

05:17.480 --> 05:23.400
The point is, and I would say the most exciting part, the most exciting part about that is,

05:23.400 --> 05:25.400
yes, we've had a lot of success with the program.

05:25.400 --> 05:30.000
I've had a lot of success with the agency, but the best part is we we've had students

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
have tremendous success.

05:31.000 --> 05:35.240
So I think you guys have probably seen this name, but Ryan Dalton, somebody that joined

05:35.240 --> 05:40.400
with me like two years ago, just over two years ago, he just hit seventy five thousand

05:40.400 --> 05:42.560
dollars per month, which is absolutely insane.

05:42.600 --> 05:48.640
And so my ultimate goal with what I'm doing in this group, what I'm doing online, what

05:48.640 --> 05:52.800
I'm doing with my program is I want to make I want to create a hunt.

05:52.800 --> 05:53.880
I don't want to take the credit.

05:53.880 --> 05:56.840
I want to help a hundred people become millionaires.

05:56.840 --> 05:57.840
That is my ultimate goal.

05:57.840 --> 06:00.720
And I have the business model that can do it.

06:00.720 --> 06:04.920
And now it's just about finding those hundred people and helping them along the way.

06:04.920 --> 06:06.720
Not everyone's going to become a millionaire.

06:06.720 --> 06:07.720
That's just the reality.

06:07.720 --> 06:08.720
But that is my ultimate goal.

06:08.720 --> 06:12.480
And so that said, guys, that's why I'm doing this.

06:13.400 --> 06:14.400
That's why I'm on here.

06:14.400 --> 06:15.400
And of course, I'm in this for business.

06:15.400 --> 06:19.560
I'm in this for money, whatever the case is, I'm not going to lie about that.

06:19.560 --> 06:24.680
But just so you guys have an idea, those are some reasons maybe you could consider listening

06:24.680 --> 06:26.200
to me.

06:26.200 --> 06:31.920
So my goal with this specific training, guys, is I want to walk you through the pros and

06:31.920 --> 06:39.000
cons of high ticket versus low ticket, including the lessons I learned and the lessons I guess

06:39.000 --> 06:43.640
that I gleaned as I, when I started, jumped into both right away.

06:43.640 --> 06:46.760
And I was trying all kinds of niches and all kinds of cities.

06:46.760 --> 06:47.760
And I didn't know what I was doing.

06:47.760 --> 06:49.920
And I was just making mistakes.

06:49.920 --> 06:53.720
And I'm going to talk to you guys in this on this presentation or this call.

06:53.720 --> 06:57.280
I'm going to teach you guys or talk to you about what worked and didn't work and also

06:57.280 --> 06:58.960
the pitfalls to avoid.

06:58.960 --> 07:05.800
And so the goal for me by the end of this next 30 minutes is I want you, every single

07:05.840 --> 07:11.320
one of you on this call to be able to have enough information to make a very educated

07:11.320 --> 07:15.320
and confident decision on which one is right for you.

07:15.320 --> 07:19.080
And I would also go so far as to say that I don't think there is necessarily a I don't

07:19.080 --> 07:20.080
think it's black and white.

07:20.080 --> 07:21.480
I don't think it's binary.

07:21.480 --> 07:23.640
I think there's shades of gray.

07:23.640 --> 07:29.280
And so maybe for you, based on your situation and your appetite and your goals, low ticket

07:29.280 --> 07:31.880
or high ticket may be for you and other people may be different.

07:32.320 --> 07:36.560
The goal is by the end of this, you have enough information and you are going to be confident

07:36.560 --> 07:39.200
and educated enough to make a decision on which one you want to pursue.

07:39.200 --> 07:43.840
And I would recommend that you do one or the other, which I'll get into in a moment, not

07:43.840 --> 07:44.840
do both.

07:44.840 --> 07:48.760
OK, so I want you guys to be able to know which route you should take to start building

07:48.760 --> 07:54.240
or if you haven't started to start building or keep building if you've already started

07:54.240 --> 07:57.200
rather your rank and rent digital real estate empire.

07:57.200 --> 08:01.080
OK, so what I would like to do to get started.

08:01.080 --> 08:04.840
I don't want this to be like super stiff, me just up there at the pulpit preaching like

08:04.840 --> 08:06.560
a pastor.

08:06.560 --> 08:11.960
But so what I want you guys, if I ask a question and I ask for feedback, I understand some

08:11.960 --> 08:15.520
of you guys may be like on the move or some of you guys may be taking care of kids or

08:15.520 --> 08:16.520
whatever and you can't.

08:16.520 --> 08:17.880
But it would really, really help.

08:17.880 --> 08:20.560
And I pay attention to who interacts.

08:20.560 --> 08:23.480
But if you guys could, if I ask a question, I want you guys to be in the comments.

08:23.480 --> 08:25.880
I want to be able to see what people are saying.

08:25.880 --> 08:30.360
And it just allows me to see who's paying attention and see what the energy is.

08:30.360 --> 08:36.680
So what I'd like to do to get started is number one, as I said, if you guys have any questions

08:36.680 --> 08:39.880
throughout this, I don't care if I'm talking about something completely different and something

08:39.880 --> 08:40.880
just pops in your mind.

08:40.880 --> 08:43.280
Just put it in the chat so I don't forget.

08:43.280 --> 08:45.640
There's no stupid or basic questions.

08:45.640 --> 08:51.360
OK, so what I want to do to start off this conversation, this presentation is I want

08:51.360 --> 08:58.680
to ask everybody to drop a comment with a niche that they are considering going into.

08:59.080 --> 09:01.720
OK, and again, there's no bad answers.

09:01.720 --> 09:05.760
Don't think, oh, I'm going to put this and Nick's going to just tell me I'm stupid because

09:05.760 --> 09:06.960
you guys might not know.

09:06.960 --> 09:09.360
And I will tell you if it's not a good idea.

09:09.360 --> 09:13.800
But I'm curious and I would love to get your feedback on everyone.

09:13.800 --> 09:18.000
Drop a comment with a niche that you are considering going into.

09:18.000 --> 09:24.480
OK, and what I would like to do, well, let's let's give everyone like a minute to do that.

09:24.480 --> 09:25.480
OK.

09:27.200 --> 09:30.840
Also, one thing while you guys are doing that, again, drop a comment of a niche you're

09:30.840 --> 09:31.760
thinking about going into.

09:31.760 --> 09:36.120
Aaron, if you would help me out in addition to admitting people, you just make sure that

09:36.120 --> 09:37.120
everyone's on mute.

09:37.120 --> 09:40.120
I don't hear anyone, but I just want to make sure that we're not getting completely sidetracked.

09:40.120 --> 09:42.080
So somebody new comes in, just keep everyone on mute.

09:42.080 --> 09:45.960
And then when we get to question and answer, we can unmute if you don't mind.

09:45.960 --> 09:47.280
So here's what we got.

09:47.280 --> 09:48.920
We got artificial grass.

09:48.920 --> 09:49.640
Love that niche.

09:49.640 --> 09:56.400
Artificial grass, fencing, good cleaning service, air duct, event photography, heat pumps,

09:56.400 --> 10:02.280
electrical repair slash paving, epoxy garage floors, plumbing, spray foam installation,

10:02.280 --> 10:08.720
garage building, concrete, home interior innovation, house painting.

10:08.720 --> 10:11.000
OK, we've got a good mix.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.640
We've got a good mix.

10:13.640 --> 10:15.920
Gutter installation.

10:15.920 --> 10:17.720
OK, I like these.

10:17.720 --> 10:18.560
And we're going to talk.

10:18.560 --> 10:24.080
By the way, if any of these you guys want feedback on, that could be a question I answer.

10:24.080 --> 10:26.920
And at the end, I could do rapid fire like yay or nay.

10:26.920 --> 10:28.720
And if I have a second, I can tell you why.

10:28.720 --> 10:33.280
Because I've done almost every single one of these that you guys have put out, with

10:33.280 --> 10:38.280
the exception of like, I think I've done all of them.

10:38.280 --> 10:43.640
I don't think I've done home interior renovation, but I do have an opinion on it.

10:43.640 --> 10:46.000
I think I've done the rest of them.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.160
Yeah, I think I have.

10:47.160 --> 10:48.920
And I've failed at a lot of them.

10:48.920 --> 10:53.040
I have not done event photography and I've not done specifically heat pumps.

10:53.040 --> 10:54.320
But everything else I have done.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.720
So I can give you guys really good feedback because I've done it.

10:56.720 --> 11:00.280
So, OK, if there's any more, let me know.

11:00.280 --> 11:03.080
If not, we're going to continue along.

11:03.080 --> 11:06.560
Now that we've got everyone here, what I want to say real quick,

11:06.560 --> 11:09.000
I don't want to say this at the beginning, but the reason that we're doing this new

11:09.000 --> 11:13.360
format, because if you have been in the group for a while, the free group,

11:13.360 --> 11:15.320
I used to just go live in the Facebook group.

11:15.320 --> 11:17.720
And then I had like it was like vanity metrics.

11:17.720 --> 11:19.640
Like, how many people can we get on the call?

11:19.640 --> 11:21.080
Can we get 100 people?

11:21.080 --> 11:24.800
And thank goodness, I've like realized that doesn't matter because I don't care

11:24.800 --> 11:27.840
if there's one person on this call, if there's five, that'd be great if there

11:27.840 --> 11:32.120
was five thousand, but I don't know what it is.

11:32.120 --> 11:35.400
But in every area of my life, I'm just realizing that quantity is so much

11:35.400 --> 11:39.400
better than quality in the content that you produce, in the businesses that you

11:39.400 --> 11:42.320
have or business that you have in the relationships that you have.

11:42.320 --> 11:44.200
All of these things always about quantity.

11:44.200 --> 11:47.080
And so as I told you guys, my goal.

11:48.160 --> 11:52.200
Ultimate, ultimate goal is to help 100 people become millionaires.

11:52.880 --> 11:56.360
That's the goal. And so I look at like, if that's the end goal,

11:57.200 --> 12:00.480
how does everything that I do, the content that I post on my stories,

12:00.480 --> 12:03.880
the things that I do in my Facebook group, do I even have a Facebook group?

12:04.160 --> 12:07.080
What are the the the topics of discussion here?

12:07.080 --> 12:11.480
What are the what what is my my inner community, my digital landlords program?

12:11.480 --> 12:12.520
What does it look like?

12:12.560 --> 12:14.720
How do I hold people's hand all the way to the finish line?

12:15.160 --> 12:18.680
All of that is with the idea in mind, like, how do I get 100 people

12:18.680 --> 12:22.000
to become millionaires? OK. And so for me, as I look at this group,

12:22.800 --> 12:26.200
we just had to like we weren't getting a ton of people that were on the call

12:26.200 --> 12:27.880
that I felt were serious. It was just dead.

12:27.880 --> 12:29.360
And it was it was whatever.

12:29.360 --> 12:31.560
And so we're like, all right, let's do this.

12:31.600 --> 12:34.680
We may only get five people on this call, but it's a risk we're willing to take.

12:35.040 --> 12:38.440
But for me, it feels like the best way that I can help you guys.

12:39.440 --> 12:41.600
Is to work with you more intimately,

12:41.800 --> 12:44.800
where you can ask me questions, where you can, you know,

12:47.560 --> 12:50.400
the things that you normally wouldn't get access to, you will get access.

12:50.400 --> 12:54.480
And this is the most intimate way that I can, you know, assist you

12:54.800 --> 12:56.440
without you being inside of my program.

12:56.440 --> 12:58.000
And so that's why I'm doing this.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.280
That's why I'm going to continue to do this.

12:59.280 --> 13:02.400
And so that's that's why we made that change.

13:02.440 --> 13:05.200
So once again, if you guys stay on this call, for those of you

13:05.200 --> 13:08.920
that joined a little bit late, we are going to be making a free resource

13:08.960 --> 13:11.960
based on the information we present in this call on low ticket versus high ticket.

13:12.280 --> 13:14.160
And it's it's going to be a digital resource.

13:14.160 --> 13:18.920
And Aaron slash Donnie Dre are going to be distributing that to you guys.

13:18.920 --> 13:20.880
You don't have to worry about commenting on a post

13:20.880 --> 13:22.680
if we give a few extra copies away. OK.

13:24.320 --> 13:27.600
Yeah, that said, let's go into low ticket versus high ticket. OK.

13:27.840 --> 13:31.520
So, guys, I'm going to try to get through this part pretty quick

13:31.720 --> 13:34.520
so we can get to Q&A, but there's a few things I want to just

13:35.240 --> 13:37.880
highlight and focus on as we go through this. OK.

13:37.880 --> 13:40.280
So let's just really quickly.

13:40.280 --> 13:41.600
I don't want to assume anything.

13:41.600 --> 13:45.000
I don't want to assume you guys have a certain level of knowledge.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.360
I'm going to pretend everyone's brand new to this business model.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.480
What is low ticket versus high ticket?

13:49.480 --> 13:52.080
OK, I'm going to make this definition really easy.

13:52.080 --> 13:55.000
Low ticket means the price of the service is relatively low.

13:55.680 --> 13:58.800
High ticket means the price of the service is relatively high.

13:58.800 --> 14:02.440
And I'm saying relatively because some things might seem expensive to some people.

14:02.440 --> 14:04.280
Some things might seem cheap to other people.

14:04.280 --> 14:06.480
But we're talking relatively speaking. OK.

14:07.040 --> 14:10.040
What are I'm going to go over a couple of niches that fall into low ticket.

14:10.200 --> 14:13.000
And these just came into my head.

14:13.000 --> 14:16.720
I think, yes, these ones I'm going to mention are all ones that I have personally tried.

14:16.720 --> 14:19.320
So we've got carpet cleaning would fall in low ticket.

14:19.840 --> 14:22.160
Towing would fall into low ticket.

14:22.160 --> 14:24.440
Cool cleaning would fall into low ticket.

14:24.720 --> 14:26.640
Handyman would fall into low ticket.

14:26.640 --> 14:28.840
Locksmith would fall in the low ticket.

14:28.840 --> 14:31.840
There's another one I saw a garage door repair would fall into low ticket.

14:31.840 --> 14:32.920
OK, these are some ideas.

14:32.920 --> 14:35.520
These are some examples of low ticket. OK.

14:35.880 --> 14:39.800
On the other hand, what are some some niches that would fall into high ticket?

14:40.040 --> 14:42.240
We've got artificial grass.

14:42.240 --> 14:43.760
We've got roofing.

14:43.760 --> 14:45.280
We've got remodeling.

14:45.280 --> 14:47.240
We've got foundation repair.

14:47.240 --> 14:49.080
We've got pool construction.

14:49.080 --> 14:51.560
OK, just to give you guys a couple of examples.

14:51.840 --> 14:53.880
And to show you the differences.

14:53.880 --> 14:55.760
Low ticket, high ticket, very simple.

14:55.760 --> 14:58.480
One of them is high ticket for the client.

14:58.480 --> 15:03.600
And typically that usually translates to more money in the business owner's pocket.

15:03.600 --> 15:07.000
Not always, but most of the time, if they're charging more money,

15:07.000 --> 15:08.680
they're going to make more money.

15:08.680 --> 15:11.120
Some of these businesses have terrible margins,

15:11.120 --> 15:13.560
but not usually these services we target. OK.

15:14.960 --> 15:18.000
So I want to talk about the pros and cons of low ticket

15:18.000 --> 15:19.400
and the pros and cons of high ticket.

15:19.400 --> 15:20.840
Again, this is coming from experience.

15:20.840 --> 15:23.240
This isn't like I read a listicle.

15:23.480 --> 15:25.200
This isn't I read an article.

15:25.200 --> 15:27.720
This isn't I talk to my buddies that are in the space.

15:27.720 --> 15:30.640
This is these are my pros and cons from experience.

15:30.640 --> 15:33.360
So let's talk about the pros of low ticket.

15:33.360 --> 15:38.800
And by the way, if there's any pros or cons that you can think of

15:39.440 --> 15:42.400
that I miss, please, by all means, drop them in the comments.

15:42.400 --> 15:45.840
OK, so here actually start with the cons, because then we can end on the pros.

15:45.840 --> 15:49.560
So the cons of low ticket, number one, lower retainers.

15:50.080 --> 15:52.880
OK. And by the way, once again, luckily for you guys,

15:52.880 --> 15:55.520
if you stay on this call, you don't have to take crazy notes

15:55.520 --> 15:57.480
because we're going to create a digital resource

15:57.480 --> 15:58.920
that's going to give you most of this information

15:58.920 --> 16:01.600
that you're going to be able to go and have access to and keep forever.

16:02.040 --> 16:03.160
So stay on this call.

16:03.160 --> 16:04.680
But I'm going to go over these really quick.

16:04.680 --> 16:06.240
So number one, low retainers.

16:06.240 --> 16:08.040
There's not as much meat on the bone.

16:08.040 --> 16:10.040
OK, if you're doing a tow truck deal

16:10.840 --> 16:13.880
and it costs one hundred dollars to go and tow someone's, you know, car.

16:14.280 --> 16:17.040
How much money could there possibly be for the business owner?

16:17.040 --> 16:18.360
Well, they got to pay for their truck.

16:18.360 --> 16:20.240
They got to pay for their gas. They got to pay their driver.

16:20.240 --> 16:22.360
They got to pay their insurance. They got to pay for their uniforms.

16:22.360 --> 16:24.840
By the time it's all said and done, if they actually look at the cost,

16:25.040 --> 16:27.720
they're probably barely making 20 bucks on that deal.

16:27.920 --> 16:30.320
So then if they split that with you, then what?

16:30.320 --> 16:31.800
Every lead you're making 10 bucks.

16:31.800 --> 16:32.560
So you do the math.

16:32.560 --> 16:35.360
If they're on a hundred dollar deal, if you're making ten dollars,

16:35.360 --> 16:37.200
they can share a hundred ten dollars with you.

16:37.200 --> 16:40.800
How many leads do you actually need to get them to charge five hundred dollars,

16:40.800 --> 16:42.720
which is not that much money? Right.

16:43.160 --> 16:46.960
So there is low retainers, typically speaking.

16:46.960 --> 16:48.520
Most often, it's low retainers.

16:48.520 --> 16:51.560
Number two, again, this is my experience.

16:51.560 --> 16:54.040
You can judge. You can call me a hater or whatever.

16:54.240 --> 16:57.040
The business owners in these niches, not always,

16:57.040 --> 17:00.120
but a lot of times are not as a business savvy.

17:00.320 --> 17:04.160
They just don't seem to get it as much as the other niches. OK.

17:04.520 --> 17:07.960
And I believe personally, because it's such a low buried entry

17:08.200 --> 17:10.360
that people could just go start a cleaning company.

17:10.360 --> 17:12.600
I mean, we could add window washing, right?

17:12.600 --> 17:14.280
That's another niche that's low ticket.

17:14.280 --> 17:17.200
And I've also tried literally today.

17:17.440 --> 17:20.360
Lane, Mr. Benson Boone, by the way, I'm not hating.

17:20.360 --> 17:21.200
I love the freaking cut.

17:21.200 --> 17:23.920
I told Kyle, by the way, you do look like Benson Boone, so keep rocking it.

17:24.800 --> 17:29.440
Lane today could go and drop over to Home Depot, buy some whatever.

17:29.880 --> 17:30.880
No one even checks.

17:30.880 --> 17:32.800
Buy some cleaning supplies.

17:32.800 --> 17:35.560
Buy whatever a squeegee and a bucket.

17:35.880 --> 17:38.640
And he could literally today.

17:38.640 --> 17:41.600
Technically, he should go get a license, but technically he could.

17:41.600 --> 17:43.760
If you want to go start knocking on doors today

17:43.760 --> 17:47.920
and he could start a cleaning company, a window washing company. OK.

17:48.440 --> 17:49.880
Awesome. That's really good.

17:49.880 --> 17:52.160
The problem is anyone could do that.

17:52.160 --> 17:53.280
And a lot of people do that.

17:53.280 --> 17:57.000
And so in my experience, you don't get that many business

17:57.000 --> 18:00.040
savvy people, because business savvy people look at the opportunity

18:00.040 --> 18:02.080
and they go, hey, if I'm going to start a business and I can start

18:02.080 --> 18:05.280
a window washing company or I could start a rank and rent digital

18:05.280 --> 18:06.800
real estate company, huh?

18:06.800 --> 18:08.760
Well, this one I could travel the world.

18:08.760 --> 18:10.160
This one has crazy margins.

18:10.160 --> 18:13.280
This one's usually a business savvy person isn't going to choose that.

18:13.280 --> 18:16.640
OK, so in my experience, you're not dealing with as savvy.

18:16.640 --> 18:18.360
I mean, especially towing.

18:18.360 --> 18:19.160
I'm just going to say it.

18:19.160 --> 18:22.760
Like I've dealt with some absolutely tough people in towing

18:23.280 --> 18:26.680
and they just don't understand like what it is to put money into a business.

18:26.840 --> 18:28.080
And get a return.

18:28.080 --> 18:30.040
And it's it's really frustrating. OK.

18:30.040 --> 18:31.720
Number three, con.

18:31.720 --> 18:34.920
You're competing against what feels like a million other marketers

18:35.120 --> 18:36.800
for the same leads.

18:36.800 --> 18:39.720
I know in your head, you're like, well, low ticket should be low competition.

18:40.160 --> 18:41.480
That's what I thought.

18:41.480 --> 18:44.160
And it actually happens to be the opposite.

18:44.560 --> 18:48.760
Carpet cleaning is one of the most competitive freaking niches out there.

18:48.960 --> 18:50.680
If you don't know that, go try it.

18:50.680 --> 18:54.360
It is very, very difficult in most markets to get a carpet

18:54.360 --> 18:55.720
cleaning website to rank on Google.

18:55.720 --> 18:58.960
And when I say competitive, I mean, cost per lead, how hard it is to rank,

18:59.080 --> 19:00.960
how many competitors, et cetera.

19:00.960 --> 19:03.520
Carpet cleaning. And that's not worth that much money.

19:03.680 --> 19:06.000
There's not that much meat on the bone in carpet cleaning.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.440
OK, so you're competing with a ton of other people.

19:08.440 --> 19:10.920
Number four, you need to consistently.

19:12.640 --> 19:14.320
Aaron, check the.

19:14.320 --> 19:16.840
Yeah, you consistently need to produce

19:17.120 --> 19:19.400
much more volume to satisfy the business owners.

19:19.400 --> 19:21.760
OK, you need to just so many more leads

19:21.920 --> 19:24.480
because there's not as much meat on the bones.

19:24.520 --> 19:25.760
What about number five?

19:25.760 --> 19:28.880
Low ticket requires just as much work as high ticket,

19:29.040 --> 19:30.920
but you don't get charged near as much, right?

19:30.920 --> 19:33.280
That kind of goes hand in hand with the lower retainer.

19:33.280 --> 19:35.000
Number six, retention.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.160
In my experience, retention is very difficult.

19:37.520 --> 19:39.920
And you guys have probably heard this, if not experienced it.

19:39.920 --> 19:42.400
But when you have clients that pay you a little bit of money,

19:42.840 --> 19:44.240
they have big problems.

19:44.240 --> 19:45.680
The people that pay you the least amount of money

19:45.680 --> 19:48.400
always have the most amount of questions, the most amount of

19:48.400 --> 19:49.960
they're the most high maintenance.

19:49.960 --> 19:51.440
And I don't know why it is. It's bananas.

19:51.440 --> 19:52.440
Actually, I do know why it is.

19:52.440 --> 19:55.640
It's because that little bit of money means everything to them.

19:55.840 --> 19:57.600
And when you go deal with big clients,

19:57.600 --> 19:59.720
they're used to stroking ten thousand dollar checks.

19:59.720 --> 20:02.040
They're used to spending, you know, having a

20:04.040 --> 20:05.360
check that just came.

20:05.360 --> 20:07.960
They need to write for a hundred thousand dollars in some cases.

20:08.160 --> 20:09.560
And these amounts don't scare them.

20:09.560 --> 20:11.840
But when you deal with these small guys,

20:11.840 --> 20:14.080
five hundred bucks a month is terrifying.

20:14.080 --> 20:15.600
That's that's a heaven forbid.

20:15.600 --> 20:16.960
That's a cell phone bill.

20:16.960 --> 20:19.520
That's another car payment so I can look rich. Right.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.320
OK. And lastly, guys, and I know there's other ones

20:22.320 --> 20:23.480
and you guys can drop them in the comments.

20:23.480 --> 20:26.800
But it seems like a lot of these lower ticket niches

20:27.240 --> 20:30.280
depend more on the GBP.

20:30.440 --> 20:31.800
If you guys don't know what the GBP is,

20:31.800 --> 20:33.240
that is the section at the top of Google.

20:33.240 --> 20:35.320
Again, I'm going to go very basic for those of you that are new.

20:35.680 --> 20:38.000
GBP is the section at the top of Google.

20:38.480 --> 20:39.760
That is the map section.

20:39.760 --> 20:41.160
It used to be called the GMB.

20:41.160 --> 20:42.360
It was also called the three pack.

20:42.360 --> 20:43.400
It's also called the map pack.

20:43.400 --> 20:44.680
It's probably going to be called something else.

20:44.680 --> 20:46.480
GBP Google business profiles.

20:47.640 --> 20:51.520
Tow trucks heavily rely towing heavily relies on maps.

20:52.320 --> 20:54.800
In my experience, carpet cleaning heavily relies on maps.

20:55.400 --> 21:01.080
Locksmith and guys from experience, from literally needing my locks

21:01.080 --> 21:04.720
change at my at my house, I went to the maps and called the first company.

21:04.720 --> 21:06.480
Like that's what I did. Period.

21:06.480 --> 21:10.480
OK, so these these lower ticket niches seem to rely on the GBP.

21:10.480 --> 21:13.280
And as you guys know, the GBP has become harder and harder to get.

21:13.520 --> 21:17.880
Whereas these bigger niches, they don't they don't they don't they're not as much

21:17.880 --> 21:19.680
because people are going to do a little bit more due diligence.

21:19.680 --> 21:22.120
They're not just going to be like, yeah, I need my foundation

21:22.120 --> 21:24.880
or paradigm and I call the first person on Google Maps.

21:25.560 --> 21:26.960
They're going to look at the website.

21:26.960 --> 21:28.520
They're going to do a little bit more due diligence.

21:28.520 --> 21:31.520
They're going to make sure that like it looks credible. Right.

21:32.040 --> 21:33.400
So these are the cons.

21:33.400 --> 21:34.840
Now, there are a few pros.

21:34.840 --> 21:37.560
Number one is a lot of times there's higher volume,

21:37.560 --> 21:38.960
a.k.a. there's more leads available.

21:38.960 --> 21:41.880
So when you're getting a deal and you throw on ads,

21:41.880 --> 21:46.200
as long as the CPC is not too high, you're going to see the movement quicker.

21:46.200 --> 21:49.520
Right. I remember having a tow truck website when I first started to do my strategy.

21:49.840 --> 21:51.480
I was seeing leads come in every day.

21:51.480 --> 21:52.800
Sometimes five, six a day.

21:52.800 --> 21:53.600
And it's exciting.

21:53.600 --> 21:55.720
And you get that little rush and that little dopamine.

21:55.720 --> 21:56.880
You're like, oh, leads are coming in.

21:56.880 --> 21:58.520
And I'm going to pass. I'm going to pass.

21:58.520 --> 22:00.640
So that's good. OK, that is fun.

22:00.640 --> 22:02.240
It's exciting.

22:02.240 --> 22:04.680
So that's a pro. We're not going to deny that. OK.

22:05.400 --> 22:07.920
Another thing that's nice about low ticket,

22:07.920 --> 22:12.640
it's very rarely brand driven, very rarely brand driven.

22:12.640 --> 22:15.560
I would wager to bet

22:15.560 --> 22:18.880
you know, most of you guys, if you needed to get your windows washed today,

22:19.840 --> 22:24.000
maybe, but I would doubt you would know like the top two companies in your city.

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
And if you do, it's probably because your cousin or your brother has a window

22:27.000 --> 22:31.120
washing company. But apart from that, you don't know any massive companies.

22:31.120 --> 22:34.960
You don't know. And it's because it's not brand driven. Right. OK.

22:35.480 --> 22:38.760
Another another pro is the leads.

22:38.760 --> 22:41.120
Oftentimes, but not always.

22:41.120 --> 22:44.280
I wanted you to remember not always, but oftentimes the leads are cheaper

22:44.280 --> 22:47.880
to acquire with paid ads. OK, again, not always.

22:48.240 --> 22:51.520
But if you go and you look at like the cost per click on towing,

22:51.920 --> 22:54.960
it's usually almost always just a couple of bucks.

22:54.960 --> 22:58.120
It's not if it's above five bucks in towing dog.

22:58.120 --> 23:01.440
That's it. That's that's rough because the money is just not there

23:01.440 --> 23:02.600
to spend that kind of money.

23:02.600 --> 23:05.480
The margins are there to kind of to spend that kind of money. OK.

23:05.720 --> 23:10.400
So typically the leads are cheaper to acquire with paid ads. OK.

23:10.480 --> 23:16.160
And lastly, as a pro is there always seems to be tons of business owners

23:16.160 --> 23:19.840
to talk to. That's a kind of a negative thing because you have a lot of competition,

23:19.840 --> 23:22.640
but it can be a positive thing because you have a lot of people to pitch

23:22.640 --> 23:25.040
a lot of potential customers because it's so low.

23:25.400 --> 23:27.400
The barrier to entry is so low. OK.

23:27.400 --> 23:31.480
So that is low ticket for you guys again to review.

23:31.960 --> 23:35.080
That's like carpet cleaning, towing, pool cleaning, handyman, locksmith,

23:35.080 --> 23:38.720
window washing, pressure washing, gutter cleaning,

23:38.720 --> 23:41.440
not gutter installation, gutter cleaning. OK.

23:41.880 --> 23:44.680
These are just some examples of in fact, I'll add these

23:44.680 --> 23:45.760
so we can add them to the sheet.

23:45.760 --> 23:48.200
So we added pressure washing.

23:48.200 --> 23:51.560
We added a gutter cleaning

23:52.240 --> 23:55.440
and we added window washing just so you guys have some examples

23:55.440 --> 23:57.720
for this digital resource we hand out. OK.

23:57.720 --> 23:59.720
OK. Now let's talk about the.

24:01.880 --> 24:03.400
Pros and cons of high ticket.

24:03.400 --> 24:06.120
OK. And actually, before I do that.

24:06.120 --> 24:08.440
And by the way, I've got about a few more things.

24:08.440 --> 24:11.480
I just got a few more things to share that we're going to go to Q&A.

24:11.480 --> 24:13.880
I want to tell you guys quickly about my first deal.

24:13.880 --> 24:15.640
It's a two minute story.

24:15.640 --> 24:16.720
Just so you guys get an idea.

24:16.720 --> 24:19.760
So my first deal was towing huntsville dot com.

24:19.760 --> 24:22.160
The website is still in existence.

24:22.160 --> 24:23.320
It's awful.

24:23.320 --> 24:26.640
It's hideous and it's hilarious, to be honest with you.

24:26.800 --> 24:28.320
In fact, I don't own it anymore.

24:28.320 --> 24:29.680
I've actually sold it since.

24:29.680 --> 24:32.040
That's how much I don't like towing.

24:32.040 --> 24:33.800
But if you want, it's towing huntsville dot com.

24:33.800 --> 24:34.800
You guys can take a look at it.

24:34.800 --> 24:36.760
It's in Huntsville. It's towing. OK.

24:36.760 --> 24:38.920
I had I knew nothing about towing.

24:38.920 --> 24:41.040
I didn't know any of the pros. I didn't know any cons.

24:41.040 --> 24:43.040
No one told me the pros and cons.

24:43.160 --> 24:45.600
If someone would have told me what I just told you guys about low ticket,

24:45.600 --> 24:48.000
I never would have gone into towing.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.960
I just heard people talking about towing and the group that I was in,

24:50.960 --> 24:53.960
the program that I was in, didn't really give clear direction.

24:53.960 --> 24:55.920
And I was like, dude, towing sounds good.

24:55.920 --> 24:58.080
Let me just build towing. OK, why not?

24:58.080 --> 25:00.320
So I built the site.

25:00.320 --> 25:03.520
By the way, this is back when before I knew that you could pre-sells

25:03.520 --> 25:07.720
before you could cheat the system and get a deal and have them pay for it.

25:07.720 --> 25:10.360
But I was doing the slow method.

25:10.360 --> 25:13.000
I built a site. I did the SEO.

25:13.000 --> 25:16.120
I got lucky because I didn't even know what competition was.

25:16.120 --> 25:18.880
It was just dumb luck. I swear to you, it was just dumb luck.

25:18.880 --> 25:21.160
And I started getting a couple of leads.

25:21.160 --> 25:24.920
And after sending these leads to a couple of different business owners,

25:24.920 --> 25:28.040
I finally got somebody on the hook and I gave them way more leads

25:28.040 --> 25:29.920
than I should have, like two weeks worth of leads.

25:29.920 --> 25:33.040
Probably gave them like 30 leads, maybe even more.

25:33.320 --> 25:36.640
And I did at the time I was doing door to door sales.

25:36.640 --> 25:39.080
I was like in person, like in person is the best.

25:39.080 --> 25:42.240
So I literally went to this tow truck like site.

25:42.640 --> 25:46.360
If you guys have been to towing sites, it's like it's like where they murder people.

25:46.360 --> 25:47.760
It's like a chain link fence.

25:47.760 --> 25:50.040
There's literally dead bodies all over.

25:50.040 --> 25:52.080
I'm kidding. But they look like that.

25:52.080 --> 25:54.440
They have this usually a shitty little office.

25:54.680 --> 25:57.920
And it just screams like money laundering. Right.

25:57.920 --> 25:59.560
Like this is just kind of the vibe.

25:59.560 --> 26:03.560
But I pulled up great Honda Civic in my door knocking uniform.

26:04.080 --> 26:07.120
You know, when inside guns ablaze and do it, I actually put a deal together.

26:07.120 --> 26:10.400
I got a six hundred dollar per month deal, made all the mistakes in the book,

26:11.320 --> 26:15.040
set the expectations wrong, didn't met the business owner, didn't do auto pay.

26:15.120 --> 26:18.400
Imagine the guy cut me a actual physical check that I walked out.

26:18.400 --> 26:20.880
I was like, and I got a physical check for six hundred bucks.

26:20.880 --> 26:23.520
It was like one of three checks that I got over the next six months

26:23.520 --> 26:26.200
because I could never get into pay. OK.

26:26.200 --> 26:30.200
As a side note, just to be fair, that six hundred dollars,

26:30.200 --> 26:32.520
that first deal blew my mind.

26:32.520 --> 26:35.240
It was euphoric, even though it was not the greatest deal.

26:35.240 --> 26:38.760
And the reason why is because it was the first time that I saw

26:38.800 --> 26:40.600
that this actually could work for me.

26:40.600 --> 26:45.000
And I want you guys all to know that that I know you're sitting on this call.

26:45.000 --> 26:48.040
Not all of you, but maybe some of you, maybe most of you, maybe all of you.

26:48.560 --> 26:51.120
And you're sitting there going, yeah, that's cool, Nick.

26:51.440 --> 26:52.680
It's cool that works for you.

26:52.680 --> 26:54.400
It's cool that works for Ryan Dalton.

26:54.400 --> 26:58.320
It's cool that it works for Juan Finesse and Eugene Song

26:58.320 --> 27:00.800
and Patrick Rowland and Jerry Ward and blah.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.360
But but but I'm different in my situation is different.

27:03.360 --> 27:06.200
And I want you to know that we all feel like that.

27:06.440 --> 27:10.720
OK, we all is as cocky and arrogant as I was when I started thinking,

27:10.720 --> 27:12.480
who the heck is that guy? If he can do it, I can do it.

27:12.480 --> 27:13.560
I had that thought.

27:13.560 --> 27:15.840
But at the same time, there was that little bit of doubt, like,

27:16.520 --> 27:18.200
I don't know, man, maybe I'm just not cut out.

27:18.200 --> 27:20.080
Guys, I didn't know.

27:20.080 --> 27:22.160
You have to understand, I did not know that

27:23.480 --> 27:26.120
a domain was the WWW dot.

27:26.120 --> 27:27.880
I didn't know that that's what it was called.

27:27.880 --> 27:29.600
I just thought it was called a website.

27:29.600 --> 27:32.400
I didn't know what SEO stood for.

27:32.400 --> 27:34.360
I didn't know what a backlink was.

27:34.440 --> 27:36.880
I didn't know that there was a way to write content.

27:37.240 --> 27:40.560
I didn't know about Weebly or I sure didn't know what hosting was.

27:40.560 --> 27:42.480
I thought that's what you did when you brought someone over to a party.

27:42.800 --> 27:44.920
I didn't know anything.

27:44.920 --> 27:49.120
Tracking numbers, I knew literally zero.

27:49.520 --> 27:52.320
Like the extent of my technology, I think I had an Instagram account

27:52.320 --> 27:54.360
that I kept deleting during the summer when I was selling

27:54.360 --> 27:55.800
because I was distracting.

27:55.800 --> 27:57.160
I like four posts on Instagram.

27:57.160 --> 27:59.600
That was the extent of my social media presence and my online

28:00.360 --> 28:03.160
technical experience. OK, so I just want you guys to know

28:03.160 --> 28:07.360
when I got that first deal, it was like, oh, my gosh, I can do this.

28:07.480 --> 28:09.440
And even though that deal wasn't the greatest deal,

28:09.760 --> 28:13.200
I still remember walking out with that check, being in that Honda Civic.

28:13.200 --> 28:14.800
It's like a million degrees in Alabama.

28:14.800 --> 28:17.440
I'm sweating when I call my dad and I'm like, Dad, I just got this deal.

28:17.680 --> 28:20.000
And I explained it to him perfectly.

28:20.160 --> 28:22.560
And he's like, I could tell he was like, is this legal?

28:22.600 --> 28:24.960
Like, this is a little sounds a little little sus.

28:25.200 --> 28:27.240
You know, that's kind of the vibe. He's super excited for me.

28:27.600 --> 28:29.760
But the thing about it was I was so pumped

28:30.120 --> 28:33.920
because I at the time was trading my time for dollars.

28:34.120 --> 28:36.000
And many of you guys, if not all of you guys can relate,

28:36.000 --> 28:39.200
unless you punch the clock, you aren't getting paid.

28:39.360 --> 28:42.960
Even if you're a salesperson, unless you are physically present,

28:43.200 --> 28:45.480
you are not getting paid. And I was that person.

28:45.480 --> 28:49.360
I did that for four years, knocking doors in the heat when I was sick,

28:49.520 --> 28:52.240
when I didn't feel like it, when my marriage was having problem,

28:52.240 --> 28:56.160
when my kids weren't well, I had to go out and get my mind right

28:56.160 --> 28:58.160
and put in the hours or else I didn't eat.

28:58.200 --> 29:00.000
And on top of that, I only got paid once.

29:00.280 --> 29:02.200
I didn't get paid every month for these deals.

29:02.200 --> 29:05.560
I got paid one time and then I had to do it again.

29:05.880 --> 29:08.680
So that was I just want you guys to know that first deal

29:08.880 --> 29:10.000
you guys are in for a treat.

29:10.000 --> 29:13.440
And I would love to go back and unexperienced everything

29:13.440 --> 29:15.480
that I've experienced and all the deals and the millions.

29:15.800 --> 29:18.640
I promise you that first deal, it might have been sweeter

29:18.640 --> 29:19.720
than the first million I made.

29:19.720 --> 29:21.560
And I seriously mean that. It was amazing.

29:21.560 --> 29:24.040
So I got my first deal in towing.

29:24.320 --> 29:27.480
Now, the problem is I didn't keep the client.

29:27.480 --> 29:30.200
I kept the client for six months, but I only got paid for like three

29:30.200 --> 29:32.600
because it was like every other month they were not paying.

29:32.840 --> 29:35.400
And I ran into a ton of the common problems

29:35.400 --> 29:36.320
that you're going to run into.

29:36.320 --> 29:39.240
So we started at a flat fee and then he wanted to go to pay per lead.

29:39.240 --> 29:41.040
And me being stupid was like, sure.

29:41.040 --> 29:43.840
And then we started highlighting, well, this is not a lead.

29:43.920 --> 29:45.440
And I had to listen to phone calls.

29:45.440 --> 29:50.360
And I realized his his call answering team was very rude, very unprofessional.

29:50.360 --> 29:51.840
They weren't even trying to close deals.

29:51.840 --> 29:54.880
And then we I mean, I spent so much time to get the six hundred dollars.

29:54.880 --> 29:56.640
OK, long story short, I lost the deal.

29:56.640 --> 30:00.840
OK, and I I think I signed one more guy and then I lost him.

30:00.960 --> 30:06.080
And then finally, I signed a deal with a guy, a great business owner,

30:06.360 --> 30:10.240
signed it, got a contract this time, did it on the flat rate for 500 bucks a month.

30:10.240 --> 30:12.600
And I sold the site. I said, I'm getting out of towing. Done.

30:12.840 --> 30:14.520
OK, that was my first deal.

30:14.520 --> 30:16.680
OK, let's talk about high ticket really quick.

30:16.680 --> 30:17.960
Pros of high ticket.

30:17.960 --> 30:21.000
Let's talk with cons of high ticket. OK, here's the cons. Number one.

30:22.200 --> 30:25.920
The competitors that you do have sometimes can be behemoths.

30:26.120 --> 30:28.160
These can be titans of industry.

30:28.160 --> 30:29.680
These can be 100 million.

30:29.680 --> 30:31.000
And I don't I'm not joking.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.400
These can be 100 million dollar companies that you're competing against

30:33.600 --> 30:38.800
with marketing companies that they bought just to service their companies.

30:38.920 --> 30:41.680
OK, these are the kind of you're going to get some high level people.

30:41.680 --> 30:43.560
Not always, but it can be the case.

30:43.560 --> 30:46.080
OK, so that can be a con.

30:46.080 --> 30:49.120
Number two, if you pick the wrong city in high ticket,

30:49.960 --> 30:53.880
you're screwed because it's almost always more competitive than low ticket

30:54.880 --> 30:56.280
in terms of ranking.

30:56.280 --> 30:59.080
I guess I wouldn't say always because low ticket is weirdly competitive

30:59.080 --> 31:00.880
in some of these niches like carpet cleaning.

31:01.240 --> 31:04.840
But if you don't get the city right, you are screwed.

31:04.840 --> 31:07.600
It is going to it's going to take you all of your energy, all of your time,

31:07.600 --> 31:10.360
all of your margin, all of your resources to rank that website.

31:10.600 --> 31:11.880
And by the time you write the website,

31:11.880 --> 31:14.200
you could have built five more in a better niche in city.

31:14.400 --> 31:16.960
OK, so you have to.

31:16.960 --> 31:18.240
I'm going to call it a con.

31:18.240 --> 31:21.080
You have to there's no room for messing up.

31:21.080 --> 31:22.960
You have to nail the city.

31:22.960 --> 31:26.520
You need to know the right city, what it looks like, what the process is.

31:26.520 --> 31:29.000
And I know some of you guys are in, I think.

31:29.240 --> 31:30.640
So Lane, I saw a few names.

31:30.640 --> 31:32.520
I'm not even looking at the picture, looking at my notes right now.

31:32.520 --> 31:35.880
But a few of you guys just hopped into digital landlords.

31:36.800 --> 31:41.040
I want you guys to focus very, very, very, very, very heavily

31:41.040 --> 31:44.080
on the due diligence process because it matters.

31:44.120 --> 31:48.920
OK, number three, in high ticket, the CPC tends to be higher.

31:49.040 --> 31:54.040
OK, so you have to really do a lot of due diligence at times

31:54.320 --> 31:57.000
to make sure that you aren't getting in over your head

31:57.000 --> 31:58.560
and you're going to be spending too much money.

31:58.560 --> 32:03.000
And guess what? Because the CPC is higher, your SEO matters that much more.

32:03.480 --> 32:06.080
OK, when you're in low ticket and you're in towing, you know,

32:06.080 --> 32:08.400
I've gotten deals before where it's a thousand dollar deal.

32:08.400 --> 32:10.400
This is a real story. Thousand dollar deal.

32:10.400 --> 32:13.880
And I could spend three hundred dollars on ads and I get a ton of leads

32:13.880 --> 32:15.800
and I can make a seven hundred dollar profit split.

32:16.040 --> 32:18.080
Boom. And some of you guys are going, why wouldn't I just do that?

32:18.120 --> 32:21.720
Well, because the truth is, all the other cons, in my opinion,

32:21.720 --> 32:24.280
don't make it worth it. OK, but I have done that.

32:24.280 --> 32:26.960
And I literally did this with a towing site,

32:28.560 --> 32:31.600
which is funny because five seconds ago, I said I got out of towing.

32:31.600 --> 32:36.200
I got out of towing until I met a neighbor in my own city in St.

32:36.200 --> 32:41.240
George that his or her son did towing.

32:41.600 --> 32:45.200
And it just made sense for me to do because I already had the client.

32:45.240 --> 32:47.400
OK, so I pre sold the client, basically.

32:47.640 --> 32:50.080
So I do still have a towing site.

32:50.080 --> 32:52.560
It's in St. George. And that's what happens when I first started.

32:52.560 --> 32:53.960
I had the thousand dollar deal.

32:53.960 --> 32:56.240
I ran the ads until it ranked. OK.

32:57.440 --> 33:00.200
But the CPC will be higher in low and high ticket.

33:00.400 --> 33:03.360
OK, the CPC will be higher 90 percent of the time.

33:03.760 --> 33:05.840
So you really have to do your due diligence, as I said,

33:05.840 --> 33:07.440
and SEO matters that much more.

33:07.440 --> 33:09.680
So you need to nail the SEO because your margins

33:09.680 --> 33:12.440
aren't going to be as good in the beginning, typically speaking.

33:12.440 --> 33:14.760
So you're going to need to make sure that SEO hits. OK.

33:15.080 --> 33:17.840
And lastly, another con that I believe is a con

33:18.840 --> 33:21.840
is because these business owners are more educated,

33:22.240 --> 33:23.560
you need to be sharper.

33:23.560 --> 33:25.960
You need to know a little bit more what you're talking about.

33:25.960 --> 33:27.920
You need to be more prepared. You need to be more polished.

33:27.920 --> 33:29.240
You need to go in with a sales script.

33:29.240 --> 33:30.720
You need to you don't.

33:30.720 --> 33:32.400
It doesn't mean you need to have 15 deals.

33:32.400 --> 33:35.760
And you need you don't need to have sales experience at the gate.

33:36.160 --> 33:38.480
But you need to be scripted. You need to be prepared.

33:38.480 --> 33:42.000
You don't just show up on a phone call with somebody that runs

33:42.000 --> 33:44.120
a 10 million dollar company doing foundation repair

33:44.120 --> 33:44.960
and think you're going to get the deal.

33:44.960 --> 33:46.280
These guys are sharp. OK.

33:46.280 --> 33:47.880
And they get hit up by vendors.

33:47.880 --> 33:50.840
What I'm going to call us vendors, marketers all day long.

33:51.040 --> 33:54.440
And so it's not the same as talking to Tommy, the tow truck guy,

33:54.600 --> 33:58.240
who, like, is just not that smart. OK.

33:58.560 --> 34:01.760
So I think it could be a con because it's a little more intimidating.

34:01.760 --> 34:06.640
But I think overall, it's a pro because, oh, my gosh, I feel so much more.

34:08.360 --> 34:12.280
What's the word edified after talking to somebody

34:12.280 --> 34:14.680
that runs a 10 million dollar company than talking to Tommy,

34:14.680 --> 34:18.560
the tow truck guy who does not just try to survive.

34:18.680 --> 34:20.400
OK. And that's maybe that's bad.

34:20.400 --> 34:22.560
Maybe it's not pros of high ticket. OK.

34:23.000 --> 34:24.840
This is what I want to focus on the pros of high ticket.

34:24.840 --> 34:27.240
Number one, we can charge fat retainers.

34:27.440 --> 34:32.160
When I scaled the 20 in 2020 to 100K, I focused on high ticket.

34:32.200 --> 34:34.680
OK, we could charge fat retainers because there's more meat on the bone.

34:34.680 --> 34:36.560
It's plain and simple. OK.

34:36.560 --> 34:41.080
Number two, this kind of goes in line with the first one,

34:41.080 --> 34:45.480
but you don't need as many clients, meaning you don't need to manage

34:45.480 --> 34:47.560
as many clients and as many problems and whatever.

34:47.640 --> 34:50.400
You can manage a lot less to make a million dollars.

34:51.280 --> 34:54.000
You don't need near as many clients with the high ticket niches

34:54.560 --> 34:57.040
near as many deals to get to a million dollars a year.

34:57.200 --> 34:59.520
OK, it's really not near as many as you think.

34:59.640 --> 35:01.600
And one thing that people don't understand.

35:01.600 --> 35:05.400
And I'll say this as a side note, is if you get a thousand dollar deal.

35:06.560 --> 35:09.120
OK, which let's say that's your first deal.

35:09.560 --> 35:11.120
It's it becomes this thing.

35:11.120 --> 35:14.520
You get your deal and you kind of there's there was this moment with students.

35:14.520 --> 35:16.680
And they're like, oh, my gosh, I just got the first deal.

35:17.200 --> 35:22.360
And all I have to do is get 83 of those, which some

35:22.560 --> 35:24.080
you might think that sounds a lot like a lot.

35:24.080 --> 35:29.440
But when I had no money in my head, I was like, wait, that what I just did.

35:29.480 --> 35:31.160
I'm making a thousand bucks a month.

35:31.160 --> 35:33.920
You're telling me if I just do that 82 more times,

35:33.920 --> 35:36.800
because 83.3 is times 12 is a million.

35:37.160 --> 35:40.760
If I just do that 82 more times, I can become a millionaire.

35:40.920 --> 35:43.800
I can a millionaire defined as making a million dollars.

35:44.040 --> 35:46.200
I can have a million dollar business, dude.

35:46.440 --> 35:48.480
I had a clear path to get there.

35:48.480 --> 35:53.120
And so what I thought was I needed 82 clients, 83 clients.

35:53.160 --> 35:56.040
But what I didn't realize is that I could go into higher ticket niches.

35:56.040 --> 35:58.520
I could charge 2000. I could charge 5000.

35:58.920 --> 36:02.000
And I also didn't realize that if I went after high ticket niches,

36:02.240 --> 36:05.200
there's bigger there's bigger fish out there that you can chase.

36:05.400 --> 36:08.200
That if you do a good job for, they are going to grow with you.

36:08.320 --> 36:11.720
They are going to they are going to want to dominate an area.

36:11.880 --> 36:14.440
And I had a client, I had two clients, one of them ballooned

36:14.440 --> 36:18.160
from like a couple thousand bucks up to like eight, eight K per month.

36:18.880 --> 36:21.280
And I had another client that started at a thousand dollars per month.

36:21.280 --> 36:25.840
I accidentally called this client in an accidental niche because it was a lead

36:26.040 --> 36:27.640
that came on the site in the wrong niche.

36:27.640 --> 36:29.360
And I'm like, let me just call whatever.

36:29.360 --> 36:33.400
And that balloon from a thousand dollars per month flat fee deal.

36:33.640 --> 36:38.360
And one of the months that I was with them, they stroked me a $30,000 check.

36:38.960 --> 36:41.360
So I'm telling you guys this because you sit there and you're like,

36:41.360 --> 36:43.440
I only have a deal. I need 83 of these.

36:43.880 --> 36:45.040
No, you don't.

36:45.040 --> 36:47.360
You need to go and do brick by brick by brick.

36:47.360 --> 36:49.600
But realize if you just take care of your freaking clients

36:49.600 --> 36:52.360
and you'll do a good job and you'll deliver and you'll focus on providing

36:52.360 --> 36:54.560
a service that's really, really good.

36:54.880 --> 36:58.760
You're going to have clients that going to balloon into five, 10, 15, 20,

36:58.760 --> 37:01.800
sometimes $30,000 clients, if you have a $30,000 client,

37:02.400 --> 37:06.120
dude, you're you're over a third of the way there with that one client.

37:06.120 --> 37:07.720
Now, there's other conversations.

37:07.720 --> 37:11.120
I don't love having clients that have that much control over my business.

37:11.960 --> 37:14.520
But at the same time, that's something you need to realize.

37:14.520 --> 37:17.440
OK, another pro, this is what I also said.

37:17.480 --> 37:19.600
They're more educated, they're more savvy.

37:19.600 --> 37:21.400
You need to be sharper, which could be a con.

37:21.400 --> 37:23.640
But also you just it's more exciting.

37:23.640 --> 37:27.440
I love getting on and I'm talking to a business owner and they're doing big things.

37:27.440 --> 37:29.160
They're making 10 million dollars a year.

37:29.160 --> 37:30.240
That's somebody I want to know.

37:30.240 --> 37:31.360
I want to know somebody.

37:31.360 --> 37:32.400
I want to have conversations.

37:32.400 --> 37:35.680
I want to have a Rolodex full of people that are millionaires.

37:35.880 --> 37:37.640
And so for me, that's fun. That's exciting.

37:37.640 --> 37:40.400
They get it when I'm talking about marketing and I'm painting the vision.

37:40.400 --> 37:42.760
Hey, you're in Dallas and we're going to go to Fort Worth.

37:42.760 --> 37:44.520
Then we're going to go to Arlington and work me and you.

37:44.520 --> 37:45.280
We're going to dominate.

37:45.280 --> 37:47.960
We're going to monopolize this area and they could see the vision

37:47.960 --> 37:50.280
and you could see the vision and you could see your paycheck could be

37:50.440 --> 37:51.520
and they could see the upside.

37:51.520 --> 37:53.320
That's fun. That's exciting.

37:53.320 --> 37:54.160
And I like that.

37:54.160 --> 37:56.640
And you don't find that near as much in low ticket. OK.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.840
There's three more quick pros.

37:58.880 --> 38:02.400
Number four, you're not competing against near as many marketers.

38:02.400 --> 38:05.960
You are competing against big dogs when you when you find competition

38:06.200 --> 38:07.880
and if you go into the wrong city.

38:07.880 --> 38:11.800
But it seems like the marketers, they all stay in the low ticket.

38:12.040 --> 38:13.760
They're all terrified of low ticket.

38:13.760 --> 38:16.080
And I don't quite understand why.

38:16.360 --> 38:20.080
But you don't seem to bump into near as many marketers in the high ticket niches.

38:20.280 --> 38:23.640
I don't really understand compared to these lower ticket niches,

38:23.640 --> 38:27.360
at least in my experience, based on the due diligence process that I have

38:27.360 --> 38:29.760
and the criteria that I have for picking a city. OK.

38:31.800 --> 38:33.480
Second to last, you don't need to produce

38:33.480 --> 38:35.280
near as many leads every month to keep them happy.

38:35.280 --> 38:37.200
You can have months where you send them six leads.

38:37.200 --> 38:40.360
And if you've set the expectations correctly, you're OK.

38:40.960 --> 38:43.120
They're not high maintenance, not near as high maintenance,

38:43.120 --> 38:46.040
because that's what happens when you charge retainers that are fat.

38:46.320 --> 38:50.800
And also because they don't need to close that many deals to pay for your bill.

38:50.920 --> 38:54.560
And they don't need to close that many deals to make the numbers make sense. OK.

38:55.440 --> 38:58.240
And then lastly, again, this kind of bleeds into some of the other ones,

38:58.240 --> 39:02.440
but they they they're just lower maintenance clients. OK, not all.

39:02.640 --> 39:04.960
But if we're looking at 10 business owners and high ticket,

39:04.960 --> 39:08.720
10 business owners and low ticket, I'm going to go ahead and put my money on

39:08.960 --> 39:12.480
eight of the 10 of the the the high ticket are going to be low maintenance.

39:12.680 --> 39:15.880
And two of the 10 of the low ticket are going to be are going to be high maintenance.

39:17.160 --> 39:19.040
Unless I said that wrong, eight of the 10 low tickets.

39:19.040 --> 39:20.160
I mean, you know what I'm saying?

39:20.160 --> 39:22.800
The low tickets, more high maintenance. That's just the reality. OK.

39:24.600 --> 39:25.640
So here's what I want to share with you.

39:25.640 --> 39:29.520
One one last quick story about my first high ticket deal.

39:29.840 --> 39:31.960
OK, and then I'm going to wrap it up and do Q&A.

39:32.960 --> 39:36.000
My first high ticket deal was ironically my second deal ever.

39:36.000 --> 39:41.080
So I got my towing deal and I just happened to to meet this guy.

39:41.080 --> 39:43.800
I was selling door to door and I knocked on his door.

39:43.800 --> 39:47.320
He wasn't interested at all in my my alarm.

39:47.360 --> 39:50.080
I was selling alarm systems. He's like, no, no.

39:50.280 --> 39:52.640
And I looked at his truck and I was like, what do you do for work, dude?

39:52.640 --> 39:56.360
We had this weird rap and he did this thing called foundation repair.

39:56.360 --> 39:58.520
And I was like, you know, I'm from St.

39:58.520 --> 40:02.480
George, Utah. We don't have we don't have I'm sorry.

40:02.840 --> 40:05.000
That wasn't foundation repair. It was a different service.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.360
It was called crawl space.

40:06.360 --> 40:08.440
It was called crawl space encapsulation. Right.

40:08.680 --> 40:11.840
So we we where I'm from, it's only foundations.

40:11.840 --> 40:13.720
It's it's just slabs. OK.

40:13.720 --> 40:16.320
And so I never even knew what a crawl space was.

40:16.320 --> 40:18.280
I was like, what crawl space? What?

40:18.800 --> 40:22.080
And he started explaining to me this model and he even took me.

40:22.080 --> 40:23.240
Imagine, guys, I'm in Alabama.

40:23.240 --> 40:25.080
I'm supposed to be selling alarms. I'm tired of it.

40:25.080 --> 40:26.600
He takes me in his crawl space.

40:26.600 --> 40:28.600
I'm like, you know, this is like out of a murder scene.

40:29.040 --> 40:30.760
He takes me. I'm supposed to be selling.

40:30.760 --> 40:33.040
I'm like one of the the the managers.

40:33.200 --> 40:35.480
And imagine I'm sitting in a crawl space like, look, let me tell you,

40:35.480 --> 40:36.560
look how much cooler it is.

40:36.560 --> 40:38.680
And it's I'm laying in a crawl space with this guy.

40:38.680 --> 40:40.920
I don't even know. And this is where I swear to you,

40:40.920 --> 40:43.920
they hide dead bodies in these things in movies.

40:43.920 --> 40:44.920
And I just had this idea.

40:44.920 --> 40:47.240
I'm like, dude, I do marketing on the side.

40:47.480 --> 40:51.760
I'm actually like I'm completely like just blowing smoke.

40:51.760 --> 40:53.960
I'm just acting like I'm way more important than I am.

40:53.960 --> 40:56.160
Like, I think I could get you some leads.

40:57.040 --> 40:58.560
And he's like, let me call my partner.

40:58.560 --> 41:00.320
So I'm pitching him right there on the spot.

41:00.320 --> 41:02.080
He calls his partner's name Ben.

41:02.080 --> 41:03.400
And he's like, hey, I'm with this guy.

41:03.400 --> 41:06.520
He walks out the side. He's like, hey, me and Ben want to take you to lunch tomorrow.

41:06.520 --> 41:09.040
And I'm like, OK. And I'm like, see you tomorrow.

41:09.480 --> 41:11.000
So I go home.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.320
I will do all the research I can on this niche.

41:14.000 --> 41:17.040
By the way, this was highly competitive, but I just went for it.

41:17.520 --> 41:20.040
And I went I met these guys at Texas Roadhouse.

41:20.040 --> 41:22.440
I still remember exactly what I ordered because I walked away.

41:22.440 --> 41:24.720
I couldn't even eat. I was just too nervous.

41:25.160 --> 41:28.200
And I went in like an absolute dummy.

41:28.200 --> 41:31.120
And I pitched them at give me a thousand bucks to build a site.

41:31.440 --> 41:33.000
And then let's do a hundred dollars per lead.

41:33.000 --> 41:34.240
I didn't know paper lead.

41:34.240 --> 41:35.440
Again, I didn't have a group like this.

41:35.440 --> 41:37.440
I didn't have somebody like me telling me don't do paper lead.

41:37.800 --> 41:40.800
But I went in a hundred bucks a lead, a thousand bucks up front.

41:41.240 --> 41:44.160
And they shook my hand and gave me the thousand dollar check.

41:44.160 --> 41:45.920
And I walked out and I felt euphoric.

41:45.920 --> 41:47.280
Again, got a thousand bucks.

41:47.280 --> 41:49.160
I'm the best salesman ever.

41:49.160 --> 41:51.080
But again, this basically just fell into my lap.

41:51.080 --> 41:52.400
It was by chance.

41:52.400 --> 41:53.400
Here's what happened, though, guys.

41:53.400 --> 41:56.880
It took me 14 months to rank that website.

41:57.920 --> 41:59.160
I didn't know I didn't run ads.

41:59.160 --> 42:00.040
I didn't know I could run ads.

42:00.040 --> 42:05.200
I didn't know any of that took me 14 months to rank this website. OK.

42:06.240 --> 42:07.800
And I think about how stupid that is.

42:07.800 --> 42:09.400
I could have ranked three, four websites.

42:09.400 --> 42:11.160
I could have got to ten thousand dollars a month by the time.

42:11.160 --> 42:11.960
But I did it.

42:11.960 --> 42:13.760
And I got it ranked and I plugged along.

42:13.760 --> 42:16.960
I did the SEO and I made the mistake of doing the paper lead model.

42:17.240 --> 42:21.240
And thank goodness these clients were actually good people and they were honest

42:21.240 --> 42:22.520
and they were actually good closers.

42:22.520 --> 42:23.640
And that's so rare.

42:23.640 --> 42:26.440
So I actually did make some money from this deal.

42:27.240 --> 42:31.520
And what ultimately happened is what always happens is it came down to like,

42:31.520 --> 42:32.680
what's a good lead? What's not?

42:32.680 --> 42:34.080
Oh, this is a duplicate lead.

42:34.080 --> 42:35.160
What do we do about those?

42:35.160 --> 42:36.400
You didn't answer the call.

42:36.400 --> 42:37.640
So is it my fault or your fault?

42:37.640 --> 42:39.120
And there became a little bit of that.

42:39.120 --> 42:41.760
And on top of that, it became ultra competitive.

42:41.760 --> 42:45.320
And my website, it was so much work to keep ranked

42:45.640 --> 42:47.720
that it ultimately didn't become worth the squeeze anymore.

42:48.440 --> 42:52.920
And so in both cases, in my low ticket example, my high ticket example,

42:53.400 --> 42:56.520
I don't have either of those deals to this day.

42:56.520 --> 42:57.960
Now, those were eight years ago.

42:57.960 --> 42:59.600
And it is what it is.

42:59.600 --> 43:02.640
But those were kind of like my extremes, like at the towing is at the low end

43:02.640 --> 43:04.560
of towing or the low end of the low ticket.

43:04.560 --> 43:08.480
And then the foundation repair is at the high like end of high ticket.

43:08.560 --> 43:11.200
OK, here's what I learned from doing both.

43:11.200 --> 43:13.920
OK, number one.

43:14.240 --> 43:16.000
And I think I just barely said this exact same thing,

43:16.000 --> 43:17.120
but I want to just recap on it.

43:17.120 --> 43:21.040
But in both in both cases, I don't have a client, as I said.

43:21.360 --> 43:26.920
And so the problem was, guys, is the low ticket.

43:26.920 --> 43:28.040
Well, hold on one second.

43:28.040 --> 43:31.160
Let me make sure that I there's one thing that I wanted to cover first.

43:31.680 --> 43:33.360
They don't want to skip.

43:33.360 --> 43:34.920
OK, no, I covered that. OK.

43:34.920 --> 43:38.720
So what I'm going to do really quick, again, we have about 12 minutes.

43:39.160 --> 43:41.160
If you have questions,

43:41.160 --> 43:44.320
I'm going to cover one last little thing here.

43:44.720 --> 43:47.160
But I do want to if you guys have questions on high ticket, low ticket,

43:47.160 --> 43:47.960
drop them out.

43:47.960 --> 43:50.560
And then in two minutes, I'm going to go to Q&A. OK.

43:50.560 --> 43:53.280
But just one last thing of what I actually learned.

43:54.320 --> 43:55.000
A couple of things I learned.

43:55.000 --> 43:59.000
Number one is not all low ticket niches are created equally.

43:59.360 --> 44:05.280
OK. And what I mean by that as a side note is low ticket that is recurring.

44:06.280 --> 44:07.360
Can work.

44:07.360 --> 44:08.720
Pool cleaning.

44:08.720 --> 44:11.040
I have a pool cleaner at my pool in the US.

44:11.040 --> 44:14.400
I pay 130, 130 bucks per week.

44:14.480 --> 44:17.600
OK, so 130 bucks per week times that by four.

44:17.760 --> 44:20.280
That's five hundred and twenty bucks a month times that by 12.

44:20.440 --> 44:21.880
That's that me.

44:21.880 --> 44:25.040
I'm worth six thousand two hundred and forty dollars to my pool cleaner

44:25.040 --> 44:25.960
every single year.

44:25.960 --> 44:27.040
And he does not.

44:27.040 --> 44:29.040
And he also charges me for chemicals on top of it.

44:29.240 --> 44:31.520
And literally he comes. It's like a 15 minute appointment.

44:31.520 --> 44:32.760
So he spends an hour.

44:32.760 --> 44:34.800
He literally spends an hour a week.

44:34.800 --> 44:38.000
He spends four hours a month with me and he makes sixty two hundred bucks.

44:38.080 --> 44:40.200
It can work if it's recurring. OK.

44:40.200 --> 44:42.840
Other thing is super high margin.

44:42.960 --> 44:45.440
Low ticket can also work.

44:45.440 --> 44:49.000
OK. Duck cleaning is a good example to get your ducks clean.

44:49.000 --> 44:51.640
We're talking, you know, small houses is less.

44:51.640 --> 44:53.480
But let's say five hundred to eight hundred bucks.

44:53.480 --> 44:55.040
OK. One time deal. OK.

44:55.040 --> 44:56.840
It's something that you should do every like six months.

44:56.840 --> 44:57.720
Supposed to do it.

44:57.720 --> 44:59.840
Typically, I haven't even done it at my house.

44:59.840 --> 45:01.360
But these the margins are insane.

45:01.360 --> 45:03.120
It's like 90 percent profit margin.

45:03.120 --> 45:05.040
So the numbers can actually work.

45:05.040 --> 45:09.920
OK. And thirdly is when I say not all low ticket niches are created equally.

45:10.160 --> 45:14.080
Is low ticket does not always mean low competition, as I already stated.

45:14.240 --> 45:19.280
In fact, some of the niches like carpet cleaning, low ticket is the most competitive.

45:19.560 --> 45:23.960
OK. On the flip side, not all high ticket niches are created equally.

45:24.400 --> 45:28.800
There is such thing as too high ticket, too high of ticket items.

45:28.800 --> 45:32.280
OK. And what I mean by that is if you get too high a ticket, for example,

45:32.280 --> 45:36.280
roofing is high ticket, but it's so high ticket, there's so much money in it.

45:36.280 --> 45:37.800
Solar. It's so high ticket.

45:37.800 --> 45:39.800
There's so much money in it that it's branded.

45:39.800 --> 45:41.640
People are spending tons of money on branding.

45:41.640 --> 45:43.320
People are spending tons of money on marketing.

45:43.320 --> 45:47.560
And it costs a lot of money to rank your website, get leads from paid ads,

45:47.560 --> 45:48.800
get leads organically.

45:48.800 --> 45:52.440
And on top of that, these companies are spending so much money on branding.

45:52.680 --> 45:54.640
It's hard to get leads from a generic website.

45:54.920 --> 45:58.480
So the key is, guys, there's a sweet spot with these niches.

45:58.480 --> 46:02.160
And it's this sweet spot between, you know, it's kind of like the city location.

46:02.160 --> 46:04.120
Or sorry, the I'm sorry.

46:04.120 --> 46:07.160
It's niches is kind of like the city side, right?

46:07.440 --> 46:09.680
So with the city side of the location side,

46:10.040 --> 46:12.240
you don't want to just have the highest population,

46:12.240 --> 46:13.880
but you also don't want the lowest population.

46:13.880 --> 46:17.200
You want the lowest population with adequate search volume.

46:17.200 --> 46:19.360
That's the sweet spot with niches.

46:19.680 --> 46:22.080
You don't just want the highest ticket,

46:22.680 --> 46:26.880
but you want the highest ticket that's doable for you to rank.

46:26.880 --> 46:28.080
That's not so competitive.

46:28.080 --> 46:31.240
So there's like these sweet spots with this picking the city.

46:31.240 --> 46:33.080
And there's a sweet spot with picking the niche.

46:33.080 --> 46:36.080
OK. And so you want to make sure it's high ticket,

46:36.080 --> 46:38.520
but not too high ticket.

46:38.520 --> 46:39.280
It's high enough ticket.

46:39.280 --> 46:40.600
You can charge a pat retainer,

46:40.600 --> 46:44.440
but it's not so high a ticket that it's that it's attracting these behemoths.

46:44.480 --> 46:46.760
It's not attracting these huge, huge, huge companies.

46:46.920 --> 46:51.480
This branding, the billboards, the ad, the commercials, the TV commercials, etc.

46:51.520 --> 46:55.440
OK. And one more side note on the, you know,

46:55.840 --> 46:59.680
high high ticket niches aren't all created equally with high ticket niches.

46:59.680 --> 47:02.720
Like roofing, sub niches can work.

47:02.800 --> 47:04.760
OK, I saw someone put plumbing.

47:04.760 --> 47:05.680
I don't like plumbing.

47:05.680 --> 47:08.000
It's it's a little too competitive for me.

47:08.000 --> 47:10.160
However, the sub niche does work.

47:10.880 --> 47:13.560
HVAC changeouts, very competitive,

47:13.720 --> 47:15.880
but there are sub niches that can work off of that.

47:15.880 --> 47:20.000
OK, anyway, so that said, guys,

47:20.000 --> 47:24.480
lastly, I just want you guys to remember that on top of just picking

47:24.480 --> 47:27.720
like the you know, how high ticket it is,

47:28.520 --> 47:29.440
because that's what we're talking about.

47:29.440 --> 47:33.320
You have to keep in mind that for me to go into a niche

47:33.320 --> 47:34.960
has to fit other criteria as well.

47:34.960 --> 47:38.320
Number one, I still believe in going into tried and true niches,

47:38.320 --> 47:42.080
boring niches until you get to a point where you have, you know,

47:42.520 --> 47:44.480
retired, gotten out of your job.

47:44.480 --> 47:45.280
So that's number one.

47:45.280 --> 47:47.680
Number two is I still believe that has to be phone driven.

47:48.040 --> 47:50.880
Number three, I still believe it needs to be an unbranded niche.

47:50.880 --> 47:53.840
Right. It shouldn't be like a picture niche where people need to see

47:53.840 --> 47:55.000
a ton of your work.

47:55.000 --> 47:57.680
And I also believe that it should be recession resistant.

47:57.760 --> 48:00.360
OK. And I just want you guys to know, as we get into Q&A here,

48:00.360 --> 48:04.400
that if I were starting over tomorrow, I would be looking at niches

48:04.400 --> 48:07.560
that fit those criteria and that are in that sweet spot

48:07.560 --> 48:09.280
in terms of high ticket there.

48:09.280 --> 48:13.440
They're high ticket enough is probably the way I would describe it.

48:13.960 --> 48:16.160
You don't just want to go in the most high ticket

48:16.160 --> 48:18.640
because now you're attracting competition.

48:19.640 --> 48:22.280
That said, guys, as I told you one more time,

48:22.600 --> 48:25.160
if you guys are on this call, we're going to do like

48:25.880 --> 48:26.920
eight minutes of Q&A.

48:26.920 --> 48:29.320
If you guys are on to the end here in five minutes,

48:29.320 --> 48:31.480
we're going to screenshot everybody that's on

48:31.520 --> 48:34.560
and we will get you a digital resource with an outline

48:34.560 --> 48:38.840
of all of the notes from this presentation that is super digestible.

48:38.840 --> 48:41.600
And you guys can basically not take notes on it.

48:41.600 --> 48:46.160
So let's see what we've got in terms of questions really, really quick.

48:46.160 --> 48:48.760
And then also, if if we don't have any questions,

48:48.760 --> 48:51.520
I can start breaking down some of these niches and, you know, yeah, your name. OK.

48:52.520 --> 48:56.360
OK, Tara Wally says Tara Wally said the Senate is going to hope

48:56.360 --> 48:58.760
you can still send me the PDF and a link to the recording.

48:58.760 --> 48:59.960
Could you also talk about home

48:59.960 --> 49:02.080
interior renovation in terms of the average ticket?

49:02.080 --> 49:04.280
I'm not sending the recording.

49:05.080 --> 49:09.960
Sorry, but yeah, Aaron can send you the the resource.

49:10.840 --> 49:12.080
And the reason I'm not sending the recording

49:12.080 --> 49:13.280
because I don't want it passed around.

49:13.280 --> 49:15.280
I want to reward you guys are actually on this call.

49:15.680 --> 49:17.360
Bravo poll says thanks in advance.

49:17.360 --> 49:19.120
Can you drop example of high ticket niches?

49:19.120 --> 49:20.960
Like, yeah, I think you said that earlier.

49:20.960 --> 49:21.720
We did that.

49:23.440 --> 49:25.560
Yeah, those are all high ticket

49:25.560 --> 49:27.400
concrete tree service.

49:27.400 --> 49:31.520
Yeah, masonry can be high ticket fencing.

49:32.800 --> 49:34.840
Artificial grass. Yeah.

49:34.840 --> 49:37.160
Who else was that you, Aaron?

49:37.160 --> 49:39.880
Yeah, yeah, like they're just like we listed there.

49:40.160 --> 49:43.400
You got any more? Yeah, I mean, I mean, I know this is this works

49:43.400 --> 49:47.200
in some areas is you're talking about some niches like roof repair

49:47.200 --> 49:50.400
can be less competitive, but still high ticket.

49:50.400 --> 49:53.280
But yeah, that's one that you want to some niche and very specific

49:53.280 --> 49:57.320
with the location and the margins on roof repair are good

49:57.320 --> 50:00.120
because it's just basically labor.

50:00.120 --> 50:02.480
Makes sense. But no, it's a good point.

50:02.480 --> 50:05.400
Todd says, would you do air duct cleaning or duct cleaning as a keyword?

50:05.400 --> 50:06.440
Dude, I do both.

50:06.440 --> 50:09.920
And I'd look at the keyword research, but those my list.

50:10.280 --> 50:12.840
I know when I built my keyword list, my core keywords,

50:12.840 --> 50:14.120
I think I had both of those in.

50:14.120 --> 50:16.680
I would just look at your keyword research, see which one gets more volume.

50:16.840 --> 50:18.240
That's going to be your main keyword.

50:18.240 --> 50:20.160
That's going to be the one you want to use in your H1.

50:20.160 --> 50:22.280
It's going to be the one you want you want to use your page title.

50:23.600 --> 50:25.840
So that's hopefully that answers.

50:25.840 --> 50:29.440
Laura says the sales cycle factor into your low or high ticket, Nick.

50:29.440 --> 50:33.400
Yeah, some, but like I don't ever go into high ticket.

50:33.400 --> 50:38.080
Laura, basically what she's asking is if it's like a super long sales process,

50:38.080 --> 50:41.040
for example, when when someone's getting their foundation fixed,

50:41.560 --> 50:44.040
they're going to have a longer sales process than your tow truck.

50:44.040 --> 50:46.600
Right. If I get if I'm broke down right now, if I go outside

50:46.600 --> 50:49.040
and I got a flat tire, I got to get it fixed right now.

50:49.520 --> 50:50.760
Right. Like I could take an Uber.

50:50.760 --> 50:52.640
I might be able to get it fixed tomorrow.

50:52.640 --> 50:54.480
So I got to get that thing to the shop. Right.

50:55.280 --> 50:57.800
I mean, they're calling a tow truck or a mobile tire guy.

50:58.000 --> 50:59.960
And funny enough, I'm not fixing it myself.

50:59.960 --> 51:02.040
Just so you know, that's why that's not an option.

51:03.120 --> 51:05.760
That's immediate foundation repair.

51:05.840 --> 51:08.640
It's kind of a decision like the foundation needs to be fixed

51:08.640 --> 51:10.080
and it needs to be fixed soon.

51:10.080 --> 51:13.720
But today or next week isn't going to necessarily change anything.

51:14.040 --> 51:17.200
So it is nice to have those lower sales cycles,

51:17.560 --> 51:20.480
but it doesn't change what I choose to go into.

51:20.800 --> 51:22.760
Keep in mind, as part of my process,

51:23.280 --> 51:24.720
I send them leads.

51:24.720 --> 51:27.160
I don't wait for them to close a deal.

51:27.160 --> 51:28.160
I send them leads.

51:28.160 --> 51:30.880
I don't even necessarily wait for them to give estimates.

51:30.880 --> 51:33.960
I just send them leads so they can get a feel of those leads. OK.

51:34.640 --> 51:36.880
Lane says, I'm starting in concrete artificial grass.

51:36.880 --> 51:38.240
Can you go into artificial grass a bit more?

51:38.240 --> 51:39.920
I'm having trouble finding says, yeah, OK.

51:39.920 --> 51:41.800
So artificial grass is a great niche.

51:41.800 --> 51:44.760
That's why I like it. Lane is because.

51:44.760 --> 51:47.120
It is, I believe, recession resistant.

51:47.280 --> 51:51.400
We have cities like Vegas that are saying you have to have artificial grass

51:51.480 --> 51:53.880
for turf by this date, you know, or else.

51:54.440 --> 51:57.400
I'm sure California, if they haven't already, is shortly behind

51:57.400 --> 52:00.360
because that's how California is.

52:00.360 --> 52:04.120
They're professional at implementing these kind of like like paper straws,

52:04.120 --> 52:06.360
which, by the way, are the worst things that have ever been invented.

52:08.440 --> 52:11.360
Anyway, that said, artificial grass, just so you know,

52:12.240 --> 52:17.640
is the niche I used in 2021 to so 2020.

52:17.640 --> 52:21.200
My niche was tree service like my my core niche.

52:21.200 --> 52:23.280
Twenty twenty one was artificial grass.

52:23.880 --> 52:28.400
And I loved the niche because I got I was there was deals.

52:28.400 --> 52:29.880
I was charged twenty five hundred bucks a month.

52:29.880 --> 52:32.320
Like the numbers just work right now.

52:32.320 --> 52:36.280
The key, like like you're saying, is finding the cities

52:36.560 --> 52:38.600
because artificial grass isn't everywhere, right?

52:38.600 --> 52:41.240
You know, there's people that need concrete in every city,

52:41.560 --> 52:44.120
but there's not demand for artificial grass in every city.

52:44.480 --> 52:45.480
And so that's the key.

52:45.480 --> 52:48.520
And so what you also have to realize with artificial grass

52:48.960 --> 52:53.120
is you're going to probably have to go through more cities

52:53.120 --> 52:55.120
and be a little bit more strategic.

52:55.120 --> 52:58.920
You're going to need to do more front end work to find that one city.

52:58.920 --> 53:01.000
You might have to look at 50.

53:01.000 --> 53:02.720
And I'm not kidding. This may sound overwhelming,

53:02.720 --> 53:05.680
but you may have to look at 50 cities to find the one.

53:06.080 --> 53:08.920
But when you find the one, it's going to be a home run.

53:09.920 --> 53:12.800
And so it's kind of like, do you want the work on the front end of the back?

53:12.800 --> 53:15.600
And in my experience, I know when you're first starting,

53:15.600 --> 53:16.640
you want to get that first deal.

53:16.640 --> 53:19.880
And so sometimes you go into the back end work so I can get the money

53:19.880 --> 53:22.000
and I can get excited and that's OK.

53:22.320 --> 53:24.200
But where I'm at, because I've closed so many deals

53:24.200 --> 53:27.120
and I've dealt with so many clients, I'd way rather do 50 due diligence

53:28.120 --> 53:29.560
and then go into the right city.

53:29.560 --> 53:32.160
So also, Lane, shoot me a message.

53:32.160 --> 53:34.200
I know you're inside of our program.

53:34.200 --> 53:36.120
So I'll send you some other ideas as well.

53:36.720 --> 53:39.600
And if I could even say, Nick, real quick on that from my experience

53:39.600 --> 53:42.760
that when approaching like number one, just make sure you have the right keywords.

53:42.760 --> 53:44.800
So like you want to have that.

53:44.840 --> 53:47.400
We talked about this, obviously, in the program, but make sure you have

53:47.400 --> 53:50.760
the keywords have the most volume because you want to do variations.

53:50.760 --> 53:54.000
Just look, there's not only one keyword because some might get more volume

53:54.000 --> 53:57.440
than others. And then also, when you do, whether you're so much

53:57.440 --> 54:01.440
a good planner, like if you can also use strategy to help you

54:01.440 --> 54:04.320
create the keywords for each city, but you can do bulk inserts.

54:04.560 --> 54:07.480
That really helps you rather than just doing one city at a time.

54:08.400 --> 54:11.440
Love that. In fact, Aaron, you should make a video on that

54:11.440 --> 54:13.360
for our group and digital.

54:13.360 --> 54:17.520
Also, by the way, Lane, search inside of digital landlords

54:17.520 --> 54:19.720
for artificial grass keywords.

54:19.720 --> 54:23.800
And I've posted like the keyword, like I've already done the work for you.

54:23.800 --> 54:25.000
So you can look it there.

54:25.000 --> 54:26.720
OK, let's say like two more questions.

54:29.080 --> 54:31.480
Where does concrete sit in verse high versus low?

54:31.480 --> 54:32.880
Concrete's in that sweet spot.

54:32.880 --> 54:34.200
That's why I love it so much.

54:34.200 --> 54:37.560
The thing you're going to run into is it is going to be more competitive

54:37.840 --> 54:40.400
in the sense you're going to run into more marketers.

54:40.560 --> 54:42.120
Doesn't mean that there's not deals.

54:42.120 --> 54:45.800
And you guys go watch my YouTube videos like I've created like three.

54:46.040 --> 54:47.760
Just because you see a marketer or a lead generator

54:47.760 --> 54:48.720
doesn't mean you can't go into it.

54:48.720 --> 54:49.920
You just treat it like another website.

54:49.920 --> 54:53.080
But you are just know you're going to see other marketers.

54:53.200 --> 54:55.120
OK, that's just the reality.

54:55.120 --> 54:57.000
But it fits in that sweet spot.

54:57.000 --> 55:00.000
Amy says, agree, Costco implemented paper straws.

55:00.000 --> 55:02.600
That's crazy to us boycott Costco. Kidding.

55:04.120 --> 55:09.280
Todd says, EG, like Minnesota, my home got some Minnesota folks on here

55:09.320 --> 55:11.840
and do not go in Midwest for artificial grass.

55:11.840 --> 55:13.600
No need. Yes, that's completely true.

55:13.600 --> 55:15.320
Artificial grass. Just be intuitive, right?

55:15.320 --> 55:19.240
Like Phoenix. Vegas, St.

55:19.240 --> 55:20.320
George, I have a St.

55:20.320 --> 55:21.360
George artificial grass site.

55:21.360 --> 55:23.160
I got my grass done at cost.

55:23.160 --> 55:24.840
I've made I make a thousand bucks a month.

55:24.840 --> 55:27.760
It's great. It's not even that big of a city. Florida's good.

55:29.320 --> 55:30.800
You know, it's getting more popular.

55:30.800 --> 55:33.120
That's what I like about it, is it's trending more popular.

55:33.120 --> 55:34.320
And I think it's resistant.

55:34.320 --> 55:38.520
It's recession resistant because of the laws, not because people are going to go,

55:38.520 --> 55:39.560
oh, I don't have much money.

55:39.560 --> 55:41.560
Let me just get artificial grass.

55:41.560 --> 55:44.760
But because of these, so I think you need to consider all these things.

55:44.760 --> 55:46.280
But yeah, Lane, just shoot me a message.

55:46.280 --> 55:49.560
We've got some more ideas, too, because there's just tons of niches out there

55:49.920 --> 55:52.120
that I think you could tap into.

55:52.120 --> 55:54.240
So awesome.

55:54.240 --> 55:56.840
Aaron, did you already do a screenshot of everyone that's on this call?

55:57.560 --> 55:59.640
I did. Beautiful.

55:59.640 --> 56:01.600
I don't know how we're going to get it to Discord user

56:02.080 --> 56:03.080
because I don't know who that is.

56:03.080 --> 56:05.760
Does Discord user want to hurry and drop their name in the chat

56:05.800 --> 56:09.520
so we can get that to them or they I guess they could also comment.

56:10.720 --> 56:12.080
Yeah, I guess that's the only person.

56:12.080 --> 56:13.760
Everyone else, I can see that. I gotcha.

56:13.760 --> 56:15.280
Cool. OK.

56:15.280 --> 56:16.960
Also, yeah, beautiful.

56:16.960 --> 56:19.840
So, guys, thank you for being on the call again.

56:21.440 --> 56:24.520
The purpose of this, like this just matches my goal.

56:24.520 --> 56:27.920
My end goal is to turn 100 people into millionaires. Right.

56:29.080 --> 56:32.080
And for me, I would rather help.

56:32.080 --> 56:33.880
How many we have on there? Like 10, 15.

56:33.880 --> 56:36.680
I'd rather help five people like deep.

56:36.680 --> 56:38.800
I'd rather go deep than wide.

56:38.800 --> 56:43.280
And I think you guys should take like just pay attention to what I'm doing there.

56:43.600 --> 56:46.440
And what I'm doing here is that like I would rather you guys go

56:46.440 --> 56:49.600
and get five clients and take super good care of them and grow with them

56:49.600 --> 56:52.000
and dominate with them and expand to three, four, five deals.

56:52.240 --> 56:54.640
You're going to get to your million dollars way faster

56:55.000 --> 56:56.840
than if you're getting a deal.

56:56.840 --> 56:58.680
You're getting the credit card, you're slamming it through

56:58.680 --> 57:01.360
and you're handing it to your VA and you're just chasing the next deal.

57:01.680 --> 57:03.040
Deep is always better than wide.

57:03.080 --> 57:04.960
And so anyway, thank you guys for being on.

57:04.960 --> 57:06.920
We're going to be doing this every Monday.

57:06.920 --> 57:09.600
Watch for the teaser post on Sunday.

57:09.600 --> 57:11.920
And the people that commented, the people that are active

57:11.920 --> 57:14.640
that I could see in the group that are getting deals that are sharing wins,

57:14.960 --> 57:16.840
they're going to get first priority on these calls.

57:16.840 --> 57:18.120
So thank you guys.

57:18.120 --> 57:21.960
We will see you next Monday and watch in your inbox from Donnie Dre

57:21.960 --> 57:24.880
for the digital resource.

57:24.880 --> 57:25.320
Thanks, guys.
