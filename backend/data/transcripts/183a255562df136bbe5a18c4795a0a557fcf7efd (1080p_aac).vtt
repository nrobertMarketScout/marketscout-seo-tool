Robert says, when are your optimal cold calling hours? Personally, mornings,

00:03.680 --> 00:07.280
afternoons, evenings. So I'll tell you the times that seem like they're not the best.

00:07.280 --> 00:11.120
And then everything else, I feel like it's pretty similar. Times that are not the best seem to be

00:11.120 --> 00:14.640
like Monday morning. So seem like a little bit tough because everyone's trying to like get after

00:14.640 --> 00:26.160
it. And then it seems like right around like, you know, 11 to one, because something like I can never

00:26.240 --> 00:30.480
tell people eat lunch. Some people eat lunch at once. Some people eat lunch like really early.

00:31.040 --> 00:35.680
So what I would recommend is like maybe try and avoid those times. And then everything else,

00:35.680 --> 00:40.240
I just kind of watch. I actually have had really good luck calling business owners on Saturdays,

00:40.240 --> 00:45.840
like believe it or not, because they're working. The ones that are working, not all of them will

00:45.840 --> 00:50.560
be, but I'll bet that most of the people that are running ads, they've got someone or they or

00:50.560 --> 00:55.600
someone else that they are paying is going to be answering the phone. Saturday, if you call me,

00:55.600 --> 01:00.000
I'm talking about strategizing for my business. I'm talking about on my business, not in my

01:00.000 --> 01:03.200
business. I've had a really good luck on Saturdays. I would just tell you the times that seem to be

01:03.200 --> 01:09.840
hard is first thing in the morning, Mondays, and then like that 11 to one timeframe, just regular

01:09.840 --> 01:13.520
days. Okay. Cause I just never know when they're doing lunch, just personal experience.
