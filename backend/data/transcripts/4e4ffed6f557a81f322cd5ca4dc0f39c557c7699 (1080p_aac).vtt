WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:16.240
Guys, I'm going to ask you to become private investigators at this stage of the list building

00:16.240 --> 00:17.240
process.

00:17.240 --> 00:21.560
So what we're going to do here is now that we've built a list of multiple business owners

00:21.560 --> 00:26.400
paying for Google Ads, Home Advisor, Angie's list, Angie's leads, whatever it's called,

00:26.400 --> 00:27.520
and on and on and on.

00:27.520 --> 00:32.000
Now what we want to do is we want to go and find specific pieces of information about

00:32.000 --> 00:35.680
this business owner so that when the leads come in and we go to make the call, when we

00:35.680 --> 00:40.880
go to make the hook, we have specific information about this individual that's going to give

00:40.880 --> 00:44.560
us, and it's going to increase our chances of getting the deal.

00:44.560 --> 00:50.600
Biggest piece of information that we need is we want the business owner's full name

00:50.600 --> 00:52.960
and cell phone if possible.

00:52.960 --> 00:56.520
Because there's a huge difference when you call in, and let's say you hit a secretary,

00:56.520 --> 01:00.280
or let's say you call them specifically and you call in and you say, Hey, is this the

01:00.280 --> 01:01.320
business owner?

01:01.320 --> 01:03.520
When you call and say, Hey, is this the business owner?

01:03.520 --> 01:04.520
Sounds sketchy.

01:04.520 --> 01:05.520
It sounds scammy.

01:05.520 --> 01:06.520
It sounds salesy.

01:06.520 --> 01:07.520
Okay.

01:07.520 --> 01:09.560
But if you call and you say, Hey, is this Mike?

01:09.560 --> 01:10.640
Sounds way different, right?

01:10.640 --> 01:13.880
You call the secretary and say, Hey, can you pass me over to Mike?

01:13.880 --> 01:15.440
This is Nick.

01:15.440 --> 01:17.960
Sounds way different than, Hey, is the business owner in?

01:17.960 --> 01:18.960
Right?

01:18.960 --> 01:19.960
Totally different.

01:19.960 --> 01:24.400
So what we're going to do in this module, or sorry, this lesson, not module, this specific

01:24.440 --> 01:29.040
lesson is we're going to find specific pieces of information about this business owner.

01:29.040 --> 01:32.200
And some of you guys are going to go, man, this is a lot like to look up.

01:32.200 --> 01:33.200
Yes, it is.

01:33.200 --> 01:34.200
But no one else is willing to do this stuff.

01:34.200 --> 01:35.200
And that's why we're doing it.

01:35.200 --> 01:37.200
So I'm going to have you jump over to the screen with me.

01:37.200 --> 01:40.200
Okay, guys, here is what we're going to do.

01:40.200 --> 01:41.200
I'm going to show you.

01:41.200 --> 01:45.640
And again, as we've talked about this specific city, there wasn't a lot of people paying

01:45.640 --> 01:46.640
for Google ads.

01:46.640 --> 01:48.800
And I just want to show you how we find this information.

01:48.800 --> 01:50.960
So I didn't build out the full list.

01:50.960 --> 01:54.960
I'm still going to go for it simply because it's such low hanging fruit and the position

01:54.960 --> 01:55.960
I'm in.

01:55.960 --> 01:56.960
So it's totally fine.

01:56.960 --> 02:01.440
But I want to show you with this McDowell landscaping old Mike, how we're going to find

02:01.440 --> 02:02.440
information.

02:02.440 --> 02:05.920
Now, the only reason I know it's Mike, going back to the previous videos, because his voicemail

02:05.920 --> 02:10.000
said it was Mike, if it didn't, what we'd have to do is start getting creative.

02:10.000 --> 02:14.480
And so one thing I want the first thing is, as far as finding the business owner's name,

02:14.480 --> 02:16.320
because I think that is super important.

02:16.320 --> 02:20.520
And that's a good starting point is finding their name is I like to check the website,

02:20.520 --> 02:21.520
obviously.

02:21.520 --> 02:22.520
Okay, so go to the website.

02:22.520 --> 02:24.080
I like to check the about page.

02:24.080 --> 02:27.280
And if that that's usually an easy place to find it.

02:27.280 --> 02:33.600
So kind of scan here, that that that that I don't see anything, Mike, I'm going to search.

02:33.600 --> 02:35.360
Yeah, I don't see.

02:35.360 --> 02:36.940
Okay, that's funny.

02:36.940 --> 02:39.400
So I don't see anything on the about section.

02:39.400 --> 02:45.680
But because I knew what the name was, I control after it, which is, you know, you could search

02:45.680 --> 02:46.680
the thing.

02:46.680 --> 02:49.180
And one of the reviews said, you know, Mike right here.

02:49.180 --> 02:51.220
So you can look at their reviews on the website.

02:51.220 --> 02:55.540
But that was the next thing that I was going to say is I like to go to their Google reviews.

02:55.540 --> 02:59.040
And you can really easily read inside the Google reviews.

02:59.040 --> 03:01.420
And people like to act like they know the business owner.

03:01.420 --> 03:04.180
They love acting important, and whatever.

03:04.180 --> 03:07.460
So they'll always say, we hired Mike to expand our patio.

03:07.460 --> 03:11.860
So maybe it's Mike, maybe that's the crew member, I don't know, okay, Mike and the McDowell

03:11.860 --> 03:12.860
landscaping team.

03:12.860 --> 03:13.860
Oh, okay.

03:13.860 --> 03:16.340
So his name is Mike, Mike and his crew.

03:16.340 --> 03:23.680
So we can pretty quickly see that his name is Mike, okay, so Mike McDowell, really simple.

03:23.680 --> 03:25.860
That's how I usually find the business owner name.

03:25.860 --> 03:28.960
Next thing I like to do is I like to find their Facebook page.

03:28.960 --> 03:32.840
So right here, this one was easy.

03:32.840 --> 03:33.920
It just popped up.

03:33.920 --> 03:37.300
So McDowell landscaping, you can tell it's the same, make sure they're in it's the right

03:37.300 --> 03:39.100
city and everything matches up.

03:39.100 --> 03:45.780
So click on this, and I'm just going to drop it over here into the Facebook page.

03:45.780 --> 03:47.260
Okay.

03:47.260 --> 03:48.260
What else?

03:48.260 --> 03:55.640
Facebook, let's see, email, let's grab the email, I didn't see it on the site, nope,

03:55.640 --> 03:57.100
but usually it is on the Facebook page.

03:57.100 --> 04:02.980
So go to the about section, I think, on here, or it's just under the home, yeah, home, look

04:02.980 --> 04:03.980
at that.

04:03.980 --> 04:08.920
And it also says in his email, Mike M, like he's just given it to us, super easy.

04:08.920 --> 04:10.600
This one's very simple.

04:10.600 --> 04:14.760
We've definitely had some other ones that have been more difficult, which I'll go over

04:14.760 --> 04:16.800
here in a moment.

04:16.800 --> 04:22.160
Current position, you can honestly skip that, I might even take that out.

04:22.160 --> 04:26.920
That's kind of where they're ranking, but they weren't ranking, so I don't need that.

04:26.920 --> 04:30.440
Only other thing I would like to add is the business owner Facebook profile.

04:30.440 --> 04:35.040
I think it's very interesting to find their profile, their Facebook profile, and just

04:35.040 --> 04:37.060
learn one or two things about them.

04:37.060 --> 04:40.140
You can learn a lot about someone based on their Facebook profile.

04:40.140 --> 04:42.060
So how do we find the Facebook profile?

04:42.060 --> 04:45.260
Well, first thing you're gonna do is you could just simply search it, okay, so you could

04:45.260 --> 04:58.060
go Mike McDowell, okay, and that's got a lot of options, so I would type in the term landscaping

04:58.060 --> 05:08.780
as well and see if that pulls it up, okay.

05:08.780 --> 05:09.780
Nothing here.

05:09.780 --> 05:13.920
Okay, I'm actually glad this is doing this so I can show you how to find this, okay.

05:13.920 --> 05:15.520
It's not pulling anything up, right?

05:15.520 --> 05:21.500
So here's a really easy way to find the, not an easy way, but a good way, and sometimes

05:21.500 --> 05:23.320
it takes a little bit of work.

05:23.320 --> 05:27.220
One way that you can find the business owner's personal Facebook profile, if they have one,

05:27.600 --> 05:32.340
is I like to go to the Facebook page, okay, and as we know, Facebook pages suck.

05:32.340 --> 05:35.640
They're not fun to look at, no one follows them, whatever, right?

05:35.640 --> 05:39.180
So one thing you can do is you can go to the Facebook page, make sure it is the same one,

05:39.180 --> 05:43.620
and then go down and look at their posts, and I want you to look at people that are

05:43.620 --> 05:45.540
liking their posts, okay.

05:45.540 --> 05:48.260
First of all, they typically are the only ones that like their own posts, so I'm gonna

05:48.260 --> 05:54.020
look for McDowell, nope, okay, so there's no one with the last name McDowell that liked

05:54.180 --> 05:57.700
it, sometimes the mom, the wife, whatever, will like it over and over, but I want to

05:57.700 --> 06:01.300
pay attention to these names, and I'm gonna start looking for commonalities, the people

06:01.300 --> 06:05.300
that keep liking the posts over and over, so I don't see any commonalities yet, but

06:05.300 --> 06:07.660
I'm gonna keep looking, okay, so nothing on this one.

06:07.660 --> 06:11.780
Let's go to the next one, four people like this one, oh, look, there's a Lynn, that looks

06:11.780 --> 06:17.180
like a mom, that looks like a potential mom, grandma, let's go to Lynn McDowell, got the

06:17.180 --> 06:22.740
same last name, we'll check out her profile, if it will load, okay, while that's loading,

06:22.740 --> 06:29.700
I'm gonna keep going, okay, we're gonna look at this one, nope, there's another Lynn McDowell,

06:29.700 --> 06:34.820
that's gotta be a relation, okay, go back to Lynn, now that we're on Lynn, we can go

06:34.820 --> 06:43.820
to her friends, and we can search for Mike, oh, look at that, Mikey boy, there he is,

06:43.820 --> 06:48.620
okay, so now we have Mike, he's the owner at McDowell Landscaping, it's the same page,

06:48.740 --> 06:55.740
we just found it, okay, so that's one of my favorite ways to, let me go right here, boom,

06:55.900 --> 06:59.540
and then I'll just scan through it and add some notes, so I'm like, okay, interesting,

06:59.540 --> 07:06.540
looks like he's on a golf course, so, okay, I like this guy already, I'm kidding, right,

07:07.100 --> 07:13.820
let's see, what else do we know about this guy, let's see, doesn't have a lot on here,

07:13.820 --> 07:19.100
I went to Chandler High School, so he's a local, born and raised, it's not crazy, he's

07:19.100 --> 07:23.940
from Canada, that's interesting, I would probably make a note of that, looks like he was an

07:23.940 --> 07:28.580
estimator at Ace Asphalt, so this is a guy who's come from another company and started

07:28.580 --> 07:32.180
his own, so there may need to be a little bit of sales training with him, there may

07:32.180 --> 07:36.660
need to be, you might need to help him think bigger because he's coming from an employee

07:36.660 --> 07:43.660
mindset, just things to note, I do like to look at their likes section, which tells a

07:43.660 --> 07:50.660
lot, so, you know, American Wire, Aztec, Back the Blue, so he's a big cop guy, yeah, he's

07:53.780 --> 07:59.780
conservative, he's got the Donald Trump stuff, yeah, this is what I like about this stuff,

07:59.780 --> 08:05.100
right, impeached Joe Biden, I mean, you can tell a lot by what he's liked, like, I already

08:05.100 --> 08:11.300
know about this guy, golf, he likes golf, he likes golf, very conservative, Tucker Carlson,

08:11.300 --> 08:18.300
Trump stuff, let's see, Sal Sumo, yeah, I mean, I know, like, not everything, Lion's

08:20.540 --> 08:27.540
Not Sheep, that's a guy to Utah, very conservative guy, like, he's a very, like, proud American,

08:27.900 --> 08:31.940
it's funny because he's from Canada, conservative, and the only reason I say this, I'm not gonna

08:31.940 --> 08:37.580
talk politics, I'm not, I will never do that, but now I kind of know, like, where he stands

08:37.580 --> 08:43.520
on stuff, I know, like, you know, just, you can almost tell what, how somebody is based

08:43.520 --> 08:47.780
on the things that they like on their Facebook page, which is scary, so maybe we should go

08:47.780 --> 08:51.780
check what we're liking on our Facebook pages, but what I'll do is I'll just go in here,

08:51.780 --> 08:58.780
and I'll go to notes, and I'll just put, from Canada, conservative, likes golf, former employee,

08:58.780 --> 09:05.780
okay, and now, here's what's cool, is when I go to call this guy, when leads start coming

09:10.580 --> 09:17.580
in, I know his name is Mike, I know, like, all this stuff about him, right, and you don't

09:17.740 --> 09:21.020
want to be creepy, you don't want to call him, like, yo, that's how you're from Canada,

09:21.020 --> 09:24.940
or you could, I've done that before, and you're like, hey, just so you know, like, before

09:24.940 --> 09:27.640
I call anybody, I noticed you were paying for Home Advisor, so I went and checked you

09:27.640 --> 09:31.280
out, and noticed you're from Canada, I wanted to, like, make sure you were legit, what part

09:31.280 --> 09:34.800
of Canada you're from, like, now the guy's like, oh, this guy knows who I am, like, he's

09:34.800 --> 09:39.760
not just, like, messing with me, so you could play it either way, but guys, it's so, so,

09:39.760 --> 09:44.080
so important that we have these pieces of information, because when you call, and you

09:44.080 --> 09:47.480
know his name is Mike, and you know he's from Canada, and you know these different things

09:47.480 --> 09:53.100
about him, you're gonna know how to talk to him, and, more importantly, you are going

09:53.580 --> 09:57.860
to be able to have that personal connection, because you actually have his name, so what

09:57.860 --> 10:01.740
I want you to do is I want you to finish out your, whatever people, whatever business owners

10:01.740 --> 10:07.580
you had on your list, I want you guys to fill this out completely, and I usually recommend

10:07.580 --> 10:13.180
to have seven to 12 businesses on my list of people paying for ads, if I can help it,

10:13.180 --> 10:17.380
they're all paying for Google ads, in this case, I'm gonna have to go with Home Advisor,

10:17.380 --> 10:20.500
or something else, because there's not really that many people paying for Google ads in

10:20.500 --> 10:23.980
this specific city, and then lastly, what I would say is this, because some of you guys

10:23.980 --> 10:27.540
are gonna be looking at this going, oh my gosh, this is a lot, it is, it is, this is

10:27.540 --> 10:30.820
a lot, and this is a time-consuming activity, so what I want you to be thinking about this

10:30.820 --> 10:35.420
entire time is, how do you get into this, how do you master this, how do you do it well

10:35.420 --> 10:39.420
enough that you could train it, and then what we're gonna do is we're gonna outsource it,

10:39.420 --> 10:42.940
okay, because this isn't something you should be spending your own time on, eventually,

10:42.940 --> 10:47.300
you should be outsourcing this to somebody else, but you have to master it first before

10:47.380 --> 10:52.660
you can outsource it, okay, so once you get really good at finding these names, getting

10:52.660 --> 10:57.460
creative about looking in the reviews, looking on the Facebook pages, doing smart searches,

10:57.460 --> 11:01.020
one last thing I do wanna mention is if you can't find a business owner's name, a good

11:01.020 --> 11:10.500
thing you can do is you can type in McDowell, like this, landscaping, LLC, and I like to

11:10.500 --> 11:18.780
type in BBB, and I like to type in Arizona, okay, like that, and typically it'll pull

11:18.780 --> 11:26.660
up a profile from the BBB, come on baby, let's go, it'll pull up a profile in a lot, and

11:26.660 --> 11:30.740
more often than not, you're gonna find a lot of good information in this if it will load,

11:30.740 --> 11:33.460
okay, so that's another really good resource, I do want this to load because I want you

11:33.460 --> 11:39.980
to see what it is, so you have the Google ad reviews, you have, sorry, the Google reviews,

11:39.980 --> 11:45.500
you have the Facebook reviews, and then this BBC thing I think is really, really powerful,

11:45.500 --> 11:49.940
so this one doesn't have a ton of information on it, it just says, you know, a phone number

11:49.940 --> 11:53.820
which is a BBB phone number, this doesn't say much, but a lot of times, oh, sorry, if

11:53.820 --> 11:57.240
you scroll down it does, I lied, okay, here we go, so if we hadn't found the business

11:57.240 --> 12:03.620
owner name, that BBB smart search helps a lot, you can go down here, it's an LLC, Mr.

12:03.860 --> 12:10.140
Michael Stephen McDowell is the owner, so boom, there you have it folks, there is his

12:10.140 --> 12:14.700
name as well, just some different tools, go ahead, find the information, get the list

12:14.700 --> 12:18.260
built, and let's go get some leads and get a business owner on the hook.
