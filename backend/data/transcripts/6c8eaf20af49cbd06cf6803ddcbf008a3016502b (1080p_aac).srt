1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,160
Alright guys, let's talk about the 80-20 rule with ranking.

2
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,500
If any of you are familiar with the 80-20 rule, I'm gonna mess this up, but basically

3
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:19,160
20% of your actions make up 80% of your results, okay?

4
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,320
That's essentially what it means.

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,120
And so what I'm gonna talk about in this video is those couple of things with ranking that

6
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,960
make all the difference in the world, that make up 80% of your results.

7
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,880
Because with SEO, there's a lot of little nuts and bolts, there's a lot of little things

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,160
that you can do, there's a lot of little things that supposedly help.

9
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:43,200
But there are three, three core things that make up the majority of that ranking.

10
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,720
And this is coming from years and years of experience, talking to SEO experts, studying

11
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,640
SEO, taking countless courses.

12
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,400
There are three things that really, really, really matter.

13
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,760
I'm gonna cover them briefly in here, we're gonna go more into them in future videos,

14
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,760
okay?

15
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,360
I want to remind you, this is an art, not an exact science, okay?

16
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:06,960
So this is one of those like soft things, it's not like a hard, okay, do this and this

17
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,800
happens, it's, okay, we're trying to figure this out, Google's doing updates, Google's

18
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,480
playing this ridiculous game, but we know that there are three things that matter more

19
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,480
than anything.

20
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,800
So the three things are as follows.

21
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:22,120
Number one is the age of the website or the age of the domain.

22
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,480
Number two is the backlinks, I'm gonna explain it.

23
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,680
And number three is content.

24
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,680
That's it!

25
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,560
If you can nail those three things, you can understand those three things and you do your

26
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:38,120
homework correctly on choosing your city and niche, you will have websites where you can

27
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,200
do most everything else wrong and you will rank, okay?

28
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,320
So let's talk about each of them really quick.

29
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,280
Age of domain, very simple.

30
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,840
How old is your domain?

31
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,600
How old, how long has it been online?

32
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,560
And here's what you need to remember.

33
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,120
The older the domain, the better, okay?

34
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:00,000
The older the domain, the better, because Google's looking at it and in their eyes,

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,040
they think, well, if a website has been around for 30 years, pretty good chance that it's

36
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,960
legit because who keeps a website around 30 years, whereas me and you, we come online

37
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:16,400
yesterday or last week or last month or last year, we could be fly by the night.

38
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,520
So age of domain is something that you can't fake, it's something that you can't really,

39
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,920
well, you can't fake it.

40
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,000
There are some strategies to buying seasoned domains and old domains.

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,040
I don't mess with that because again, we're not talking about national rankings, we're

42
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,960
talking about these super competitive niches.

43
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:36,640
If we do, this is why I stressed so hard on making sure the city and the niche were on

44
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,040
point in the very, in part one of the training, okay?

45
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,320
In the very, very, very first module, that's why we talked about this and looking for layers

46
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:49,480
because if we do that correctly, then these things aren't as important.

47
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:53,320
But age of domain, just understand it's a factor and when you're doing your homework

48
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,760
on cities, if you are going up against a website that looks like garbage and you're like, why

49
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:03,800
are they ranking, it could be that that website's like 40 years old or 30 years old, whatever

50
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,800
the internet started.

51
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,600
And I've come across those, those are hard to beat.

52
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:11,120
We cannot fake that part, so we have to do the other two correctly.

53
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,760
We have to win at the other two, okay?

54
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,120
Next thing is backlinks and I'm just giving a brief overview here.

55
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,240
Backlinks, I'm gonna explain backlinks and first of all, if you don't know, backlinks

56
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,120
are when you're reading an article, right, or a blog and it's like, yeah, we talked about

57
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:32,120
this in our other post that you can see here and here is underlined, you can click on it,

58
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,720
it takes you to another article, that's a backlink, okay?

59
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,560
Within backlinks, there are two different types, there's a do follow and a no follow,

60
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:45,160
I'm gonna be covering that in a future module and lesson, but there's a no follow and a

61
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:49,920
do follow, do follow help, no follow, technically don't, but enough of that.

62
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,120
Backlinks are really simple, understanding backlinks goes like this.

63
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,800
You know back in high school or maybe you're one of the few in our program that is in high

64
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:03,040
school and shout out to you guys, but in high school, you know, who you hang out with, everyone

65
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,040
judges you on that, right?

66
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:08,400
And I'm gonna give you an example, if you are somebody that hangs out with the cowboys

67
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:14,160
or the cowgirls, even if you're not a cowboy, you are dubbed as a cowboy.

68
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:20,160
If your friend group is the group that goes and gets high on the weekend or whatever,

69
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,340
gets stoned on Wednesday night, even if you're not smoking weed, guess what?

70
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:30,440
You're one of the pot smokers or the skateboarders or the jocks, right?

71
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,640
Whoever you hang out with is who people think you are, even if you're not and it's the same

72
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,440
thing online.

73
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:40,280
Whoever you are linked to is who Google thinks you are.

74
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:46,480
So if the game is really simple, how do we link ourselves to people or not in this case

75
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,360
of websites of higher status than us, right?

76
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,460
Status status.

77
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:56,120
If we can link ourselves to, in a perfect world, if we could get a link from Forbes

78
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:02,480
and Entrepreneur and you know, the New York Times, even though we're this brand new kid

79
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:07,640
on the block, dude, Google's gonna go, that guy's with the, think about it, right?

80
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,600
If you had three billionaire friends and you guys were just out slumming the town, even

81
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,680
if you had zero dollars in your bank account, people are gonna go, dude, who's that guy?

82
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,560
Who's that girl?

83
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,800
She's in this group, she must be special.

84
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,800
That's how Google looks at it.

85
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,760
So we're gonna get into this, so don't overthink this, but backlinks are important.

86
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,240
They're kind of that like steroid, if you will.

87
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,560
So it's something that gives us that extra boost and there's strategies to getting those

88
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,560
backlinks.

89
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,640
You gotta understand that it's about getting linked to people that Google views as trustworthy

90
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,720
and of high status, okay?

91
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,780
And number three is content and that's the one that we're gonna focus the most on because

92
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:44,780
of a couple of reasons.

93
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:49,920
Number one, most business owners are not willing to write content and I'm actually talking

94
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,160
about the words that go on the page, okay?

95
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,960
Most business owners, when they think of writing content, they write a paragraph that's 25

96
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,240
words, maybe a little review at the bottom from one of their customers and boom, they're

97
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,440
done.

98
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,720
But guess what?

99
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,800
Think about it like this, Google does not have eyeballs.

100
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,800
Google has algorithms that crawl our websites.

101
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,280
They can't see what's on your website.

102
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,220
They can only read.

103
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:18,880
So how is Google, if you don't have anything besides 20 or 25 words of content on your

104
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,040
website, how is Google going to know what your website is about?

105
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:27,120
How is Google going to know about concrete contractors or that you talk about concrete

106
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,400
contractors if you don't have any content talking about concrete contractors?

107
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,360
Or concrete companies, right?

108
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,920
Or the cost of concrete, or concrete St. George, Utah, or concrete near me.

109
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,560
Yet, these business owners don't understand this.

110
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,000
They don't put any content on their website because content is hard.

111
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,200
Content takes work.

112
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,640
Content takes thinking and thought and getting down and doing it and editing it and putting

113
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,640
it on the site.

114
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,640
It's hard.

115
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,640
So we're gonna do it.

116
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,640
We're gonna do it.

117
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,640
We're gonna master it.

118
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,640
We're gonna dominate it.

119
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:58,880
We are going to win, mark my words and listen to me carefully, we are going to win this

120
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,240
SEO game with content.

121
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,760
We can't do a whole lot about age.

122
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,760
We can't.

123
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:06,440
But we can do something about backlinks and we certainly can do something about content.

124
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:10,640
So when we get to the content module and you're like, oh my gosh, he's asking me to do so

125
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,800
much, you're welcome.

126
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,800
Because that is the very thing that's going to make the difference because no one's willing

127
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,440
to do it and it's very, very, very important.

128
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,760
Every word that we put on the page matters.

129
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:26,320
Every word matters because it's exactly what Google is going to look at.

130
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:30,080
And when I say look at, I mean analyze because they don't have eyes.

131
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,800
These are algorithms that crawl.

132
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,920
They read the text.

133
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,920
They don't look at the pictures.

134
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,680
They don't look at the website.

135
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,000
So content is super, super important.

136
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,080
So guys, I just wanted you to have a quick overview of these different pieces of SEO.

137
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,120
And the three things that matter again are the age of the domain, your backlinks and

138
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,120
your content.

139
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:54,680
Now, as we get going, we're gonna be talking about on-page SEO and off-page SEO and within

140
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:58,560
that there's multiple facets and we're gonna be talking about image optimization and all

141
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,800
these things.

142
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,760
But I want you to stay focused on age of domain, which you can't really control, but you need

143
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,760
to consider.

144
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,480
You need to be focused on backlinks and content.

145
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:11,080
If you can master content and you can get good at content and creating keyword lists

146
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,560
and writing content, and guys, it doesn't have to be perfect.

147
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,680
We're gonna get into that.

148
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,840
But if you can focus on those things, this is the 80-20 rule.

149
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:23,460
If you can focus and master those three things, you will rank in the majority of these cities

150
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:28,000
and niches if you have done module one, looking for layups correctly.

151
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,080
All right, guys, let's go build our website.
