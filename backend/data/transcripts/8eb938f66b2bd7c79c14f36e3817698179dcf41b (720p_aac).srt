1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,640
If it is taking a while for the next lead to come in four plus days and business owners already given out the first estimate, are you doing soft touches in between or are you only calling them when you have a lead?

2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,280
Definitely do soft touches, bro.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,120
So here's the thing, guys, we're coming in for all of us that are in this group.

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,080
Those are you that were my freaking OGs that joined the for the very first batch of people.

5
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:29,700
You guys were the first cohort, by the way, shout out to all you guys when this was just a freaking thought in my head and you guys gave me money and you're like, I think this guy is going to pull through, man.

6
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,140
I think I shout out to you guys.

7
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,540
OK, I know I gave you guys a discount, but I can't thank you guys enough for trusting me.

8
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,180
And anyway, I always say that because I feel indebted to you guys.

9
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:44,020
Thank you. OK, but for those of you that are the OGs that joined back last year, we did this.

10
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:52,820
We launched this thing in the middle of the winter, in the middle of the quote unquote worst month of the year.

11
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,340
OK, and guys, trust me.

12
00:00:55,340 --> 00:01:00,220
And when I say quote unquote, it's because I think every month is bad in some way and good in some way.

13
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,900
OK, it's bad because it's harder to get leads.

14
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,100
But guess what? The business owners are hungry.

15
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,900
The summer is bad because the business owners are full.

16
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:14,300
Their stomachs are full, but it's it's easier and it's good because the leads are cheap because, you know, people need the service stuff.

17
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,940
So I believe I say it's bad because everyone looks at it like that's the slow time.

18
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:24,900
We launched this thing in December and we had people getting deals left and right and all the rest.

19
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:30,660
So first and foremost, if you see a slowdown, it's part of the game.

20
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:34,100
And as we start to see these slowdowns, there's weather, there's recession,

21
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:39,140
there's this whole thing with the opting out of the search networks, et cetera.

22
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,580
Right. We just have to be strategic.

23
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:48,020
Go back to our the setup, go back to overcoming, sorry, not overcoming, eliminating objection.

24
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,420
If you are seeing that, just bring it up.

25
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,900
So when you get on and you hook the business owner, say, hey, Mr.

26
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,900
Business Owner, hey, Mrs. Business Owner, I'm going to get you a couple of leads.

27
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:01,780
I don't know if it's going to be tomorrow, if it's going to be in three days.

28
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,620
It might take a couple of weeks. I want to get you some good ones.

29
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:09,100
OK, so I'll I'll be in touch, but let me get you a couple of good ones and then let's talk.

30
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:14,660
And then my rule of thumb is I usually get them if they close the first lead,

31
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:19,700
boom, I'm pitching it or I get them, you know, three to five leads or I just feel that it's right.

32
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:23,220
So, Drew, all I would say, yeah, for sure, do the soft touches.

33
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,500
You can maybe let them know, hey, you know, whatever.

34
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,780
We've got some some funky calls coming in.

35
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,420
It's pretty normal this time of year.

36
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,860
If it's not a big deal to you, it's not a big deal to them.

37
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:37,020
We've I've closed plenty of deals in October or November now.

38
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,660
This is a great month still.

39
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:42,580
And guys, we launched this thing in December and people were closing deals left and right.

40
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,860
So it's it's something we're just got to realize we're going to

41
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,580
we're going to be sending these people less leads.

42
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,900
If you've been sending people seven leads, we might only be sending them three leads.

43
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,140
What that means that we got to get every lead we need to squeeze it.

44
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:58,260
OK, we can't just waste a lead at this point. Good question.

45
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,300
Guy says he likes my zoom in the king of digital real estate.

46
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:07,820
You know it, bro. OK, soft touches are some of the things I just said.

47
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:11,620
Just just touching in, man, just be a human like, hey, how'd that go?

48
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,540
Did you did you get that? Did you pitch him?

49
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,900
Cool. Did you need me to follow up?

50
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,460
Are you going to follow up? Awesome.

51
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,620
Well, let me just tell you what we got going on over here.

52
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,340
Like, just be a human.

53
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,940
The more soft touches you have.

54
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:24,260
I like to have a lot of soft touches until we close the deal.

55
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:28,060
I still like to have a lot of soft touches until we resign the contract.

56
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:31,100
And then after that initial contract is when you can kind of pull back

57
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,660
and just kind of self-regulate in my experience.
