00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,320
Guys, before we get into the Costco sample strategy too heavily, I want to remind you

2
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:20,080
that every single thing that we have done up to this point leads to this moment.

3
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,560
The reason that this process works is because we give results in advance.

4
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,360
We give people value and the goal is to give more value than they can pay for.

5
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,960
We want to give our free stuff, we want to make it better than their paid stuff.

6
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,120
There's no coincidence that that's what I'm doing in the free group.

7
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,480
I'm trying to give this as an example.

8
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,440
I'm trying to show you guys if you give free value that's better than most people's paid,

9
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,720
people will buy.

10
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,760
That's the reason you're here.

11
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,400
I don't want to overwhelm you.

12
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,440
I don't want to freak you out.

13
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,720
I don't want you to overthink it, but I do want you to remember everything leads here

14
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,760
and I've seen a few people in the past.

15
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,440
They've done everything right up to this point.

16
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,600
They've hooked the business owner and they think the deal is done.

17
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,640
They think it's over.

18
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,240
Guys, it is not over.

19
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,680
You do not skip this step.

20
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,120
You do not gloss over this step.

21
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,600
You do not do this step differently than I'm going to teach you.

22
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,720
There is a correct way to send these samples.

23
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,080
There is an incorrect way to send these samples and I've done all of them.

24
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,360
I've tried all of them.

25
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:17,840
Trust me.

26
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,200
I'm going to teach you the way and some of you guys are going to listen to this way and go,

27
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,040
oh man, that takes a couple of steps.

28
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,000
Yes, it does, but it's going to speed the deal up.

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,200
It's going to overcut.

30
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,320
I'm going to get into all that in a moment.

31
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,440
I just want to stress the importance that this step is so important and this isn't a

32
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:38,800
super long module, but I want you to do this exactly as I teach it because this is key

33
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,840
to everything.

34
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,600
First of all, what I want to talk about is what is the Costco sample strategy?

35
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,320
Why do we call it that?

36
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,440
Costco is what they call a big box retailer.

37
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,200
Basically, for those of you that don't know, it's like a huge grocery store,

38
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,640
but the difference is you go in, they sell huge quantities.

39
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,040
Instead of selling a candy bar, they sell packs of 30 candy bars.

40
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,400
Instead of selling cheese, they sell bricks of cheese.

41
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,000
Instead of selling laundry detergent, they sell cases of it.

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,360
You have to have a membership and all this stuff, but what they do is on Saturdays,

43
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:15,040
every single Saturday, you can go in and at the end caps in different places throughout the store,

44
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,040
they position these booths.

45
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,480
These booths have these different products that they're trying to sell.

46
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,520
It's juice, it's cheese, it's sausage, it's bread.

47
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,000
They stick somebody behind these booths and all they do is they cook this food or they

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,480
pour these drinks and they hand samples out.

49
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,920
These people don't have sales experience.

50
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,120
These people are typically seniors who are literally just trying to make enough money

51
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,600
to live.

52
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,360
They're not high energy, young salespeople.

53
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,480
These are just people just doing their job, handing out samples.

54
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,880
I don't even think they train them on sales experience at all.

55
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,720
I don't think they train them at all.

56
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:54,240
Okay, but Costco's figured out that if you have a product that is good,

57
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:59,600
if you have a juice that tastes amazing, all you got to do is get people to try it

58
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,880
and they will buy, okay?

59
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,480
And it is exactly what we're doing, right?

60
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,200
We know our product's amazing, but we got to get people to try it.

61
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,720
And we want to do it with no risk.

62
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,640
We don't want them to have to pay for it in advance.

63
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:17,120
We want them to try it without having any type of payment without any type of risk, okay?

64
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,320
So that is why we call it the Costco sample strategy.

65
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:25,440
We are going to give the samples, okay, without asking for anything in advance.

66
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,440
We're just going to give them results in advance.

67
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,680
And this does a couple of things that I want to go over really quick.

68
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:35,040
The number one thing that doing this does is it overcomes the objection of trust.

69
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,240
I'm telling you guys, after having done sales for almost 10 years now,

70
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,920
the number one objection that's going to kill deals is trust.

71
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,600
If someone can't trust you, they will not buy, period.

72
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,240
And I could say that 100 times and I probably wouldn't say it enough.

73
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,440
You can do everything correctly.

74
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,560
You can have the perfect product.

75
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,360
They can need it.

76
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,000
They can want it.

77
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,960
They can have the budget.

78
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,040
Everything can make sense, but if they don't trust you, they will not buy.

79
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,800
If there is any doubt in their mind that your service is going to work,

80
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,520
they will not buy, okay?

81
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,520
So by sending these results in advance,

82
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,120
it is the quickest, fastest way to overcome the objection of trust.

83
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,400
And a lot of people think that the way to overcome trust is having a fancy website,

84
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,440
you know, having these little blurbs of customer testimonials at the bottom,

85
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,720
having reviews.

86
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,680
Guess what, guys?

87
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,520
I have never had an agency website.

88
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:26,400
And I've worked with companies doing $500 million in a year, okay?

89
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,200
They own multiple companies under their umbrella

90
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,800
and they have never looked at my website.

91
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,680
And you know why?

92
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,360
It's because I overcome the objection of trust by giving them results in advance, okay?

93
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,440
Those of you that are in this program watching this,

94
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,040
notice we never had a landing page.

95
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,480
Notice there's no page that has the fancy this and the fancy that

96
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,720
and it's laid out and it's sponsored by this

97
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,040
and it's approved by this and a stamp of approval by that.

98
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,080
You guys know that this works because you have seen how good my free content is

99
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,080
and so it only makes sense that my paid stuff is that much better, okay?

100
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,920
So the number one thing that this does by sending the results in advance

101
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:06,080
and by doing the Costco sample strategy is it overcomes the objection of trust.

102
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,760
The second thing that it does is it demands,

103
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:13,200
actually it demands and commands attention, okay?

104
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,120
Because no one else is doing it.

105
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,120
Nobody else is doing it and especially the way that we do it, okay?

106
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,520
I had one of our students, we recently interviewed her

107
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,640
and she said something to the effect that she got talking to this business owner

108
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:28,560
and she said, hey, you know, we do leads, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

109
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,760
And the business owner cut her off and said, yeah, everybody does leads now.

110
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,320
Home advisor does leads and this and she said, yeah,

111
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,560
but do they give you free results in advance before they ever ask for a dollar?

112
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,200
And the business owner just kind of stopped

113
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,640
and didn't really know what to say and said, well, no, okay?

114
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,920
Guys, you have to realize and I think sometimes we forget because we do it

115
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,680
and we do it so often, we are literally giving them liquid gold,

116
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,120
not liquid gold, digital gold, right?

117
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,160
We're giving them jobs that if you're in the right niches

118
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,400
can be worth and are worth thousands and thousands of dollars, okay?

119
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,880
So second thing it does, it commands and demands attention.

120
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,040
The third thing this does, it shows the business owner,

121
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,240
we're not messing around, we mean business, we're calling them

122
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,760
and we are giving them results in advance, we mean business,

123
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,760
we're here to do a deal, we're not here to mess around,

124
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:19,680
we're not here to play around, we are here to get it done.

125
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:25,040
And so those three things are what allows the deal to be sped up,

126
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,440
it's what allows us to overcome the trust

127
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,840
and it's what allows the business owner to know, hey, this guy, this girl, this lady,

128
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,800
they're messing around.

129
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:38,960
Last thing guys, we are going to be doing these Costco samples live, okay?

130
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,600
We are not gonna be doing a text message,

131
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,960
we're not gonna be doing an email,

132
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,080
we sure as hell aren't gonna forward the calls directly to them in the beginning,

133
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,120
we are going to be doing these live, okay?

134
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,080
And the reason why we do it live is because we,

135
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,320
I personally and many of our students have experiences in the past

136
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,960
where they hear of this concept, they're like, yeah, that makes sense.

137
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,080
You give people results up front and you go and close them.

138
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,160
What happens is if you do this incorrectly and you just send over the leads

139
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,680
or you just forward the leads,

140
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,000
you'll jump on the call, the Zoom call at the end

141
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,280
and you're jacked, you're like, dude, I've sent 20 leads to this guy,

142
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,760
20 leads to this lady, she's gonna be closed.

143
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:19,760
You get on and you find out they've gotten a hold of one,

144
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,200
they've gotten a hold of two

145
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,600
and they haven't even given estimates to those two yet

146
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,040
or they've scheduled estimates

147
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,880
but they haven't even gone out to the estimates.

148
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,360
And literally, it doesn't, like you sending the 20 leads did nothing, okay?

149
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,440
And so the reason that we do it live

150
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,560
is it allows us to control the entire process, okay?

151
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,600
It allows us to hand them a hot lead.

152
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,680
It allows us to hand it off so they don't say something wrong.

153
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,640
It allows us to show them exactly what they're getting, okay?

154
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:52,640
And so doing this live is such an important piece of this puzzle.

155
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,520
We're gonna get into that later

156
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,920
and if you can't do it live and if you have a job, that doesn't matter.

157
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,400
We have solutions around that

158
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:05,280
but I do wanna tell you, if at all possible, we want to do these live.

159
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,000
Doing this live is the equivalent of Costco.

160
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,200
This is something they don't do.

161
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,360
This is the one thing I think they could do even better

162
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,080
is imagine if Costco that gives these free samples,

163
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,520
imagine if they came and they said,

164
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,960
hey, you can have this sample, this cookie is free,

165
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,440
this drink is free, this cheese is free

166
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,760
but you need to stand right there and I need to watch you eat it.

167
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,280
And that'd be a little bit weird

168
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,080
but the truth is sometimes I remember and I still do this,

169
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,960
I'll go and I'll grab the sample and then I'll kind of smell it

170
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,240
or I'll look at it or I'll give it to my kid or I'll throw it away

171
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,440
and if I don't taste it, I'm never gonna buy it, okay?

172
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,360
So it's almost like a waste of the sample

173
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,440
but if Costco said, hey, you can have a sample,

174
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,880
in fact, I'll give you three of them

175
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,840
but I want you to try them.

176
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,040
I want you to eat them right here

177
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,080
so I can see that you taste it, that you can try it, okay?

178
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,720
Because if your product is good, it's gonna sell itself

179
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,840
but they have to try it.

180
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,920
And so the reason that we do it live

181
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,840
is it forces the business owner to try and to taste our samples

182
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,120
and what's crazy and what's cool is we actually know

183
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,520
they're already in the market for this, okay?

184
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:09,600
This is like somebody already being in the market for cheese

185
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,960
and somebody at Costco being like,

186
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,920
hey, I know you're looking to buy cheese, come try this one, okay?

187
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,560
They don't do that, they give every sample to everyone.

188
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,520
We're only giving our samples to people that are looking

189
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:24,160
and already paying for a product or service similar, okay?

190
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,840
So just before we jump into this,

191
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,280
I wanna stress the importance.

192
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,720
Do not skip this step.

193
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,200
This step is an absolute game changer.

194
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,440
Doing it correctly is a game changer.

195
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,200
Don't breeze through this, don't rush through this,

196
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,600
don't think that the deal is done, it is far from done.

197
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,440
Do this correctly and we will close deals

198
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,560
and we'll close them fast.
