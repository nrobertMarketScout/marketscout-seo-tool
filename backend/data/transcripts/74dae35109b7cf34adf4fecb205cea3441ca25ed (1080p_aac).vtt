WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.120
Okay, so I'm just going to cover, by the way, welcome to the call once again.

00:05.120 --> 00:11.720
If you are brand new to this group and it's your first call, welcome to Digital Landlords

00:11.720 --> 00:16.360
Live, which we're going to be doing every single bloody week.

00:16.360 --> 00:19.720
Yeah, every week, every Tuesday, 7 a.m.

00:19.720 --> 00:20.720
MST.

00:20.720 --> 00:24.440
I understand it's not the most convenient time.

00:24.440 --> 00:27.480
By the way, if you guys can hear me, please let me know.

00:27.480 --> 00:31.680
I have my mic plugged in and sometimes it does a little funny business.

00:31.680 --> 00:35.840
So anyway, if you're brand new to this group, you're going to see me going live every single

00:35.840 --> 00:36.840
week.

00:36.840 --> 00:42.600
I think over the course of almost three years now, there's only been two times that I haven't

00:42.600 --> 00:46.600
been live and I got stuck in the bush.

00:46.600 --> 00:51.040
And I literally was planning on being back at my hotel.

00:51.040 --> 00:53.560
I was in Africa and I just couldn't do it.

00:53.560 --> 00:56.080
Every other situation, it's either me or I've got somebody live.

00:56.080 --> 01:01.240
And I think in those situations, I still put up a replay or gave you guys something.

01:01.240 --> 01:05.480
So make sure to set your calendars every single Tuesday, 7 a.m.

01:05.480 --> 01:07.320
You will see me going live, OK?

01:07.320 --> 01:12.280
Real quick, the only thing that I want to cover is I guess maybe two things.

01:12.280 --> 01:18.120
Number one is if you didn't catch, was it last week or the week before?

01:18.120 --> 01:19.480
Maybe it was a couple of weeks ago.

01:19.480 --> 01:24.080
But if you did not catch the live I did with Ryan Dalton, you guys need to go check that

01:24.080 --> 01:25.080
out.

01:25.320 --> 01:27.360
Find that really quick.

01:27.360 --> 01:33.840
Guys, if you haven't been messing around, playing around with the tool, the rank and

01:33.840 --> 01:41.960
rent engine tool, this thing is making business so much easier than when I was coming up.

01:41.960 --> 01:43.920
Let me go ahead and find that real quick.

01:43.920 --> 01:45.160
I'm going to lose my train of thought.

01:45.160 --> 01:47.600
Where the heck is that live?

01:47.600 --> 01:49.560
I know it's got to be right here at the top.

01:49.560 --> 01:53.280
Let me just scroll just a tiny bit.

01:53.280 --> 01:54.280
Where the heck is it at?

01:54.280 --> 01:55.280
Search it.

01:55.280 --> 01:56.280
Hold on.

01:56.280 --> 01:58.640
Oh, that's weird.

01:58.640 --> 02:01.440
That's weird because that thing got a lot of views.

02:01.440 --> 02:02.440
Hold on.

02:02.440 --> 02:03.880
Give me a sec.

02:03.880 --> 02:05.800
I want to just share this live in the chat.

02:05.800 --> 02:07.360
OK, I'm going to search it.

02:07.360 --> 02:08.360
Hold on.

02:08.360 --> 02:09.360
One sec.

02:09.360 --> 02:10.360
Tool.

02:10.360 --> 02:16.240
OK, there it is.

02:16.240 --> 02:19.240
Hold on.

02:19.240 --> 02:20.240
Got it.

02:20.240 --> 02:21.240
And boom.

02:21.240 --> 02:22.240
OK.

02:22.240 --> 02:26.080
If you guys have not watched this, check this out.

02:26.080 --> 02:30.840
By the way, Stephanie, what's going on?

02:30.840 --> 02:33.480
That's the only other person I saw that looks new from what I was saying before.

02:33.480 --> 02:34.480
OK.

02:34.480 --> 02:37.440
If you guys didn't watch that, I'll try to even pin that.

02:37.440 --> 02:39.600
That is such a good live.

02:39.600 --> 02:46.520
Just real quick in a nutshell, guys, Ryan Dalton has built this very cool tool that

02:46.520 --> 02:55.480
has basically taken everything that you need to build and scale your rank and rent agency.

02:55.480 --> 02:56.640
And he's put it into a tool.

02:56.640 --> 02:58.540
Go to rankandrentengine.com.

02:58.540 --> 03:04.000
If anyone remembers the exact code, I think it's Ignition24.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
All caps.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
I'm going to type that.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.840
I think that's what it is.

03:08.840 --> 03:12.120
Ignition24, I think.

03:12.120 --> 03:15.600
And what that's going to allow you guys to do.

03:15.600 --> 03:17.120
It's a beta discount.

03:17.120 --> 03:25.560
So we're in the week, basically the beginning of week three of beta for that software.

03:25.560 --> 03:26.920
Now I've been through it.

03:26.920 --> 03:29.160
I spent time almost every day.

03:29.160 --> 03:34.400
Yesterday, I spent about 30, 35 minutes doing more due diligence.

03:34.400 --> 03:37.360
And man, that's not perfect.

03:37.360 --> 03:38.820
We're going to be giving him feedback.

03:38.820 --> 03:41.560
We're going to be making changes, whatever.

03:41.800 --> 03:47.120
The thing that I love about it is with some of these other tools, the SEMrush, the Mangles,

03:47.120 --> 03:51.480
whatever, we don't have control over it because it's just a tool that somebody else owns.

03:51.480 --> 03:55.640
And with this one, like real time, we can give Ryan feedback and say, hey, what about

03:55.640 --> 03:56.640
this feature?

03:56.640 --> 03:57.640
What about this feature?

03:57.640 --> 03:58.640
What about this feature?

03:58.640 --> 04:00.600
And it's made for rank and rent.

04:00.600 --> 04:05.440
There's other tools that people use for rank and rent, like high level and lead snap and

04:05.440 --> 04:06.440
stuff like that.

04:06.440 --> 04:12.840
Also, they built it for a wider platform in an effort to attract more people, which is

04:12.840 --> 04:13.840
fine.

04:13.840 --> 04:20.040
However, I think they did it wrong because this was built specifically for rank and rent

04:20.040 --> 04:21.560
and rank and rent only.

04:21.560 --> 04:24.960
And so if you are in rank and rent, it makes total sense.

04:24.960 --> 04:30.760
So anyway, guys, no pressure, but I am telling you, you can, in fact, you know what I should

04:30.760 --> 04:33.960
do really quick?

04:33.960 --> 04:36.600
Is there a way I can show you without giving away my secrets?

04:36.600 --> 04:37.600
Hold on.

04:37.600 --> 04:42.800
Let me see if I open this up, if it's going to just show you my entire freaking whatever.

04:42.800 --> 04:47.480
I don't know if I can do that.

04:47.480 --> 04:52.160
I don't know if I can do that.

04:52.160 --> 04:53.160
Let's see.

04:53.160 --> 04:57.520
Yeah, I'll just do it anyway.

04:57.520 --> 04:58.520
Let me just do this really quick.

04:58.520 --> 05:02.040
I'm going to show you guys two seconds and we're going to get going on this call.

05:02.040 --> 05:03.040
One second.

05:03.040 --> 05:04.040
Okay.

05:04.040 --> 05:05.040
Ready?

05:05.040 --> 05:06.040
Okay.

05:06.040 --> 05:07.840
Hopefully you guys can see my screen.

05:07.840 --> 05:09.520
I just want to show you guys really quick.

05:09.520 --> 05:14.280
So go rankandrentengine.com, but it's literally this dope tool.

05:14.280 --> 05:20.440
You've got the task tracker, which is like, guys, I was paying for this software.

05:20.440 --> 05:21.440
Let's see.

05:21.440 --> 05:22.440
What software was I using?

05:22.440 --> 05:23.440
Kind of like this.

05:23.440 --> 05:27.240
This is a software we were using kind of like, what's that?

05:27.240 --> 05:28.480
I can't even remember what it's called.

05:28.480 --> 05:31.840
It's the one where you just move stuff around, not air table, something else.

05:31.840 --> 05:33.880
Anyway, I was paid for a software that basically did this.

05:33.880 --> 05:36.440
You could just drag your tasks like this.

05:36.440 --> 05:42.640
I think it might've been Pipe Drive, but Francesca's put all these in and yeah, you could just

05:42.640 --> 05:44.880
track all your tasks you need to do inside your agency.

05:44.880 --> 05:46.960
So we've been messing around with that a bit.

05:46.960 --> 05:48.840
You've got your due diligence, which is dope.

05:48.840 --> 05:50.480
You can really crank out due diligence.

05:50.480 --> 05:57.360
I used to spend an hour per due diligence to really look at a city and now I can pipe

05:57.960 --> 06:02.880
everything in and I'm able to knock out a due diligence in like less than 12 minutes.

06:02.880 --> 06:08.200
And I think I can get that down to about seven minutes once I really get the hang of this,

06:08.200 --> 06:09.200
which is incredible.

06:09.200 --> 06:11.840
It literally computes the data like that.

06:11.840 --> 06:13.000
Then you have your site portfolio.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.780
You can keep track of all your sites.

06:14.780 --> 06:20.040
You got your prospecting pipeline and there's literally a software called Pipe Drive that

06:20.040 --> 06:25.200
this does the same thing as you've got your client list, all your leads, all your calls.

06:25.200 --> 06:26.520
You can buy your tracking numbers.

06:26.520 --> 06:29.840
You can analyze a site, which is the same thing that SEMrush does.

06:29.840 --> 06:34.720
You get your keyword planner and this is version one.

06:34.720 --> 06:37.640
So I'm getting pretty pumped about this.

06:37.640 --> 06:43.040
Our goal as an agency, and I don't know if you guys saw this post by Francesca.

06:43.040 --> 06:50.880
We did an estimate on Thursday of last week and I say Francesca did it.

06:50.880 --> 06:54.440
We gave them an option of $7,500 or $10,000 per month.

06:54.440 --> 06:55.440
That was their two options.

06:55.640 --> 07:01.080
Now we may not even get the deal at all, but those are the type of deals that get me juiced

07:01.080 --> 07:02.080
up, get me excited.

07:02.080 --> 07:03.680
Those are the ones I'll get involved in.

07:03.680 --> 07:11.320
If it's 10 grand a month, I'll show up to a call, but I'm not even including that.

07:11.320 --> 07:19.040
Our goal is to add, by December 1st, to add an extra $10,000 per month to our agency.

07:19.040 --> 07:22.160
Not to my digital landlords program, whatever.

07:22.160 --> 07:23.160
We're going to keep growing this.

07:23.160 --> 07:24.920
I'm going to keep focusing on this.

07:25.440 --> 07:26.440
We've got a ton of stuff.

07:26.440 --> 07:28.520
We're working on version 3.0.

07:28.520 --> 07:30.680
We're working on new ad stuff, a bunch of stuff.

07:30.680 --> 07:36.120
But just the agency alone, we're going to add an extra $10,000 in the next 45 days.

07:36.120 --> 07:37.200
Mark my words.

07:37.200 --> 07:40.680
And this tool is making it very, very easy.

07:40.680 --> 07:42.000
So anyway, guys, I'm stoked about this.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.520
I've been playing around a lot with this.

07:43.520 --> 07:48.720
And this has taken the Google Sheet, the Airtable, the Pipe Drive, the Google Doc,

07:48.720 --> 07:53.680
the SEMrush, the Mangools, the keyword planner, and you've got one tool that's

07:53.680 --> 07:54.680
focused on rank and rent.

07:54.720 --> 07:56.560
So if you guys haven't already, go play around with this thing.

07:56.560 --> 07:57.560
There's a free version.

07:58.360 --> 08:02.960
But if you use that Ignition 24, then it's 20% off for the first couple of months.

08:03.240 --> 08:04.320
And that's part of the beta.

08:04.320 --> 08:07.760
And we want the feedback and everything else so we can make this as good as possible.

08:07.760 --> 08:09.120
But shout out to Ryan Dalton.

08:09.400 --> 08:10.440
Great job, my friend.

08:10.720 --> 08:11.240
Okay.

08:11.280 --> 08:16.240
That said, guys, let me give a little preface to this call and let's do it.

08:16.240 --> 08:17.800
Let me just get back to my screen.

08:19.680 --> 08:20.240
I lost it.

08:20.520 --> 08:21.040
Hold on.

08:22.160 --> 08:22.880
I lost it.

08:22.960 --> 08:23.560
There it is.

08:23.600 --> 08:23.920
Okay.

08:24.680 --> 08:25.200
Beautiful.

08:26.640 --> 08:27.160
Okay.

08:27.240 --> 08:28.600
Everyone can still hear me.

08:28.640 --> 08:30.080
What else we got here?

08:30.120 --> 08:35.120
We've got Matt Torres.

08:35.120 --> 08:35.800
What's up?

08:36.480 --> 08:37.480
And Mr.

08:37.480 --> 08:38.760
Kurt Dahlstrom.

08:38.880 --> 08:40.160
Guys, it's crazy to me.

08:40.160 --> 08:41.200
I love this, by the way.

08:41.200 --> 08:43.360
We've got people from all over the world in this call right now.

08:43.360 --> 08:46.360
Like I just saw Corey and Nick.

08:46.480 --> 08:50.000
Corey and Nicholas are like five minutes from me or 10 minutes from me, which is

08:50.000 --> 08:50.560
awesome.

08:51.560 --> 08:56.400
And then we've got on the other extreme, we've got Kurt, who's in China.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.280
He's a resident of China right now.

08:59.480 --> 09:00.600
I think that's what you'd say.

09:01.120 --> 09:04.320
Trying to see if I can recognize anyone else that's in a far flung place.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.440
Some of these people are, some of you guys are in different parts of the states,

09:08.440 --> 09:10.800
but we're all here doing the same thing.

09:10.800 --> 09:11.560
This is the community.

09:11.560 --> 09:13.880
Make sure you guys are in this community every single day.

09:14.160 --> 09:15.000
Make connections.

09:15.000 --> 09:19.560
If you haven't already done your intro post, do it and go find some people that

09:19.600 --> 09:20.480
are in your situation.

09:20.480 --> 09:21.400
You guys can connect.

09:21.640 --> 09:24.640
And like I was saying, Corey and Nicholas, you guys should definitely connect up.

09:24.640 --> 09:25.760
Jahill says, quick question.

09:25.760 --> 09:27.320
What would you say the baseline search volume would?

09:27.560 --> 09:27.800
Okay.

09:27.800 --> 09:29.080
That's the question, right?

09:29.200 --> 09:34.680
So Jahill, I think I know what it is because I've been playing around a lot

09:34.680 --> 09:35.440
with this tool.

09:35.760 --> 09:39.800
That's going to be our topic for our live in the next week or two.

09:39.960 --> 09:45.160
I know I've been saying that for a while, but I really want to make dang sure

09:45.240 --> 09:48.080
that when I say, Hey, it's 50, then it's 50.

09:48.200 --> 09:53.360
But that is one of the beautiful things about having a tool that we can control.

09:53.360 --> 09:59.680
As I can confidently say, when the tool says this, you can be 95% sure there's

09:59.680 --> 10:00.480
going to be enough volume.

10:00.480 --> 10:03.520
And I was talking to Corey Gilbert about this yesterday real quick, and then

10:03.520 --> 10:04.400
we'll get into this call.

10:04.720 --> 10:10.440
And he was asking me about population and I was telling him, Hey, population

10:10.440 --> 10:12.800
does not matter, which is the truth.

10:12.960 --> 10:14.720
It comes down to search volume.

10:15.080 --> 10:18.680
But generally speaking, the bigger the population, the more search volume

10:18.680 --> 10:20.720
there's going to be generally speaking, right?

10:20.720 --> 10:22.440
Not in every case, but in most cases.

10:22.920 --> 10:27.720
Um, but what I would definitely say guys is on your first project, your first five

10:27.720 --> 10:32.960
projects, make sure you're not risking, you know, you want to get into usually a

10:32.960 --> 10:38.200
smaller city, a smaller population means less competition, but not always.

10:38.360 --> 10:38.880
Okay.

10:38.960 --> 10:43.640
So you always want to have like the lowest competition, the lowest population

10:43.640 --> 10:46.960
technically, because that means the lower competition, but you've got to make

10:46.960 --> 10:49.200
sure that you're, you're getting enough search volume.

10:49.440 --> 10:54.600
You don't want to go into a city, um, where, you know, you're running ads,

10:54.600 --> 10:58.120
you're, you're, you're ranking on Google and there's just not enough leads.

10:58.160 --> 10:58.320
Okay.

10:58.320 --> 10:59.160
That's the worst.

10:59.160 --> 11:02.280
And I've done that before and I've done this in too small of cities.

11:02.560 --> 11:04.640
Um, the search volume has been too low, et cetera.

11:04.840 --> 11:08.920
So I would just recommend on your first couple of projects, make sure you guys

11:08.920 --> 11:15.520
are being safe about going into a city that has enough search volume and you're

11:15.520 --> 11:17.880
not even worried that you're going to not have enough.

11:17.880 --> 11:18.040
Okay.

11:18.040 --> 11:22.200
So I know for example, we're running a deal right now where we have a one pager

11:22.200 --> 11:26.720
in a city in, I think Virginia, and we're having a problem getting leads.

11:26.760 --> 11:28.280
I didn't pick the city, Francesca.

11:28.280 --> 11:29.040
Gosh, dang it.

11:29.280 --> 11:30.520
Francesca picked the city.

11:30.760 --> 11:34.080
It was one of those that looked like low hanging fruit, but it was on the

11:34.080 --> 11:36.200
bordering edge of is there going to be enough volume?

11:36.200 --> 11:37.800
And it's looking like there's not.

11:38.120 --> 11:39.760
And so I don't want you guys to make that mistake.

11:39.760 --> 11:43.400
So make sure there's enough volume, uh, on these first deals.

11:43.440 --> 11:45.000
Don't, don't even risk it.

11:45.200 --> 11:46.840
Make sure you're going to have enough search volume.

11:46.840 --> 11:47.280
Okay.

11:48.080 --> 11:48.880
Okay.

11:49.040 --> 11:53.200
That said, and Jahill, I promise you that's not going to be a question that's avoided.

11:53.200 --> 11:55.920
I'm that's why I'm in the tool so much.

11:55.920 --> 11:58.600
Part of the reason I'm checking out the due diligence, I want to know this

11:58.600 --> 12:00.400
thing inside and out backwards and forward.

12:00.720 --> 12:04.920
So if I'm going to endorse something, then I need to know it every part of it.

12:04.920 --> 12:07.560
And I do know that there's a few little holes and tweaks we need to make,

12:07.640 --> 12:09.120
but we want to hear your feedback as well.

12:09.120 --> 12:12.800
So, um, Lynel says, how long do you run ads before it's a volume issue?

12:14.520 --> 12:19.320
I know if like, I I'll know it's a volume issue within the first couple of weeks.

12:19.720 --> 12:20.160
Okay.

12:20.400 --> 12:23.960
And, but you have to keep in mind, you have to think about the time of year.

12:24.080 --> 12:26.320
You have to think about, you know, other circumstances.

12:26.440 --> 12:27.920
We've got the election coming up.

12:28.080 --> 12:30.680
We got fricking, we're in the middle of a recession.

12:30.800 --> 12:32.040
People are uncertain.

12:32.160 --> 12:34.080
I've got my business owner right now.

12:34.280 --> 12:36.760
Um, just so you guys know, I have problems too.

12:36.880 --> 12:40.120
I have a business owner that's been with me a long time threatening, not

12:40.120 --> 12:43.520
threatening, but telling me, I don't know, maybe I should just pause till the election.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.600
And we're like, what are you talking about, dude?

12:45.800 --> 12:47.120
What are you freaking talking about?

12:47.120 --> 12:51.880
So there are some weird stuff going on in the world, but we're still pressing for it.

12:51.880 --> 12:54.720
We just made a $10,000 a month offer, right?

12:54.760 --> 12:57.280
So we're still, the companies that are hungry are hungry.

12:57.480 --> 12:59.120
And, uh, that's just the game name of the game.

12:59.160 --> 13:01.520
So hopefully that answers your question.

13:01.840 --> 13:04.320
Um, Daniel Kelly, what does enough volume mean to you?

13:04.320 --> 13:05.360
We're going to cover that.

13:05.560 --> 13:11.240
Um, but for now I would, I don't even want to give you, uh, I would just say,

13:11.240 --> 13:16.240
make sure that your main keyword, if you want to be safe, safe, safe, safe, safe,

13:16.240 --> 13:21.960
make sure your main keyword on, uh, uh, rank and run engine says at least a hundred.

13:22.040 --> 13:22.240
Okay.

13:22.240 --> 13:23.840
That's being very safe.

13:23.880 --> 13:24.320
Okay.

13:24.520 --> 13:27.200
And I don't think it's going to mean to be near that, but if you want me to do

13:27.200 --> 13:31.320
that without having to go in and check the tool very well, which I'm going to,

13:31.520 --> 13:37.080
if it says a hundred and the CPC is something less than $5 on, you know, two,

13:37.080 --> 13:40.400
three, four of the main keywords, then you probably going to be safe.

13:40.440 --> 13:40.840
Okay.

13:40.960 --> 13:43.880
And if you're looking at population, I know population doesn't matter, but it

13:43.880 --> 13:46.040
can be indicative of how competitive it is.

13:46.360 --> 13:51.200
Um, you know, a hundred thousand plus to be very safe is going to be work.

13:51.200 --> 13:53.520
Now I've gotten deals in cities with 30,000.

13:53.760 --> 13:58.200
Um, so I'm going to try to give you guys the bare minimum search volume.

13:58.520 --> 14:02.400
And then you guys can know that anything above that should work, but for, to be

14:02.400 --> 14:07.120
safe for a quick answer, that's what I would say real quick.

14:07.160 --> 14:08.840
Adair says people are still spending money though.

14:08.840 --> 14:11.920
I just talked to, I just talked to a concrete guy and said they want, they

14:11.920 --> 14:13.120
start three to five pools a week.

14:13.440 --> 14:17.320
People are still spending money in the, in the right parts of the country, the

14:17.320 --> 14:20.880
right mindsets, like people are still spending money, dude.

14:20.960 --> 14:22.320
That's the, that's a great point.

14:22.320 --> 14:22.800
I dare.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.080
Um, okay, guys, let's get in the call.

14:25.200 --> 14:28.920
Uh, today I got a treat for you guys.

14:29.640 --> 14:30.640
I'm going to be bringing on Mr.

14:30.640 --> 14:31.480
Zach Powell.

14:31.880 --> 14:37.800
Um, now I want to just preface this and let you guys know that this call, um,

14:37.840 --> 14:39.560
we're going to take an interesting angle with this call.

14:39.600 --> 14:42.720
For those of you that just got in this program, I don't want you to be confused.

14:42.720 --> 14:45.240
I don't want you to be scatterbrained, whatever.

14:45.600 --> 14:47.040
Zach Powell is crushing it.

14:47.080 --> 14:47.320
Okay.

14:47.320 --> 14:53.240
Now Zach Powell came into this program, I think it was two and a half years ago

14:53.600 --> 15:00.480
and he was in a situation where he was in a job making, and he'll confirm this

15:00.480 --> 15:04.480
thing was like five, six grand a month and he needed to get out of the job as

15:04.480 --> 15:09.360
soon as possible so he could focus on, you know, his business and so he was

15:09.360 --> 15:11.920
sitting there looking like, what's the quickest way I can get out of my job?

15:12.160 --> 15:16.880
And he decided to take this skillset and take it a little bit different angle.

15:17.200 --> 15:20.200
So he's still doing the same thing, but instead of selling the leads, he's

15:20.200 --> 15:22.800
actually just selling the service SEO as a service.

15:22.800 --> 15:26.560
Now you guys might've heard me talk at length about how I don't like to do this.

15:26.840 --> 15:27.600
And that is the truth.

15:27.640 --> 15:33.600
I do not at the time of, of talking at this very moment, think we have an SEO

15:33.600 --> 15:37.880
client, if we do, it's like a, it's like a $500 a month client because

15:37.880 --> 15:38.840
Francesca signed it.

15:39.200 --> 15:44.840
I, I had a bad experience, um, in the long run with SEO because I did it wrong.

15:44.880 --> 15:45.400
Okay.

15:46.040 --> 15:48.680
So I'm going to bring on Zach today.

15:48.680 --> 15:54.200
Zach has been able to figure out how to literally build a business brick by brick.

15:54.520 --> 15:58.640
And I mean that because he's figured out a way to go and get deals where most

15:58.640 --> 16:02.240
people wouldn't even, you know, consider getting deals with these SEO clients.

16:02.280 --> 16:06.720
And he's literally built a business brick by brick and he has built it up to

16:06.720 --> 16:09.680
56,000 or $57,000 per month.

16:10.160 --> 16:12.480
Um, there is a correct way to do this.

16:12.520 --> 16:17.760
And the reason for those of you, like, I want to stand by my, like my belief is

16:17.760 --> 16:21.640
that the true way to scale this thing, the true way to have a business that's

16:21.640 --> 16:26.640
passive that you can build today, get it ranked and not have to spend a ton of

16:26.640 --> 16:31.520
time on it and go and live your life, travel to Dubai, you know, travel to

16:31.520 --> 16:37.280
Africa, coach your kids' soccer team, go be a service missionary, do this, do

16:37.280 --> 16:38.600
that, coach high school football.

16:39.200 --> 16:40.120
That's through Legion.

16:40.560 --> 16:44.560
However, I do understand that if you're in a situation where you're stuck in a

16:44.560 --> 16:49.200
job and you want it, you need to get out of that job so you can focus on this.

16:49.480 --> 16:53.880
Then in, in certain situations, you know, getting a few SEO deals to get those

16:53.880 --> 16:58.280
bills paid is not a bad option, but there's a correct way to do it.

16:58.280 --> 16:59.160
And there's a wrong way to do it.

16:59.160 --> 17:00.320
So I'm going to have Zach come on today.

17:00.320 --> 17:01.720
We're going to be talking about mindset.

17:01.720 --> 17:03.480
We're going to be talking about his strategy.

17:03.720 --> 17:08.360
We're going to be talking about a ton of different stuff, um, that Zach does, but

17:08.360 --> 17:11.520
I just want to say that, so I don't want anyone to get super in the weeds,

17:11.520 --> 17:13.160
confused, whatever.

17:13.840 --> 17:16.640
Guys, SEO is part of lead generation.

17:16.680 --> 17:19.360
We do SEO to get our leads in the long run.

17:19.360 --> 17:21.120
We do the ads, we get the deal.

17:21.120 --> 17:24.520
Then we do the SEO to sustain the deal to then be able to turn off ads.

17:24.800 --> 17:26.440
These go hand in hand, right?

17:26.840 --> 17:31.480
Um, so I just want you guys, again, I don't want to confuse anyone, but Zach has

17:31.480 --> 17:33.520
been doing this in a strategic way.

17:33.680 --> 17:37.920
And you can go, if you do this in a way where you go after people that are

17:38.040 --> 17:42.360
potential lead generation clients, you can get them on an SEO deal and you can

17:42.360 --> 17:44.760
turn around and sell them lead generation.

17:44.920 --> 17:47.240
And the lead generation is going to be the thing that sticks.

17:47.440 --> 17:50.880
And the SEO might be the thing that falls off, but Zach has figured

17:50.880 --> 17:52.480
out some very cool strategies.

17:52.480 --> 17:54.920
He scaled this thing up to $57,000 per month.

17:55.320 --> 17:58.040
Two and a half years ago was making five to seven grand per month.

17:58.320 --> 18:00.160
And I'm going to be bringing him on right now.

18:00.160 --> 18:01.280
So let's welcome Mr.

18:01.280 --> 18:02.040
Zach Powell.

18:02.520 --> 18:03.480
Here he comes.

18:05.720 --> 18:06.880
Look at this handsome devil.

18:11.040 --> 18:11.880
He's joining right now.

18:11.960 --> 18:12.600
Zach Powell.

18:12.640 --> 18:13.400
What's up, bro?

18:14.600 --> 18:15.440
What's up, Nick?

18:15.440 --> 18:16.120
How's it going, man?

18:16.560 --> 18:17.720
Dude, it's going great.

18:17.720 --> 18:18.320
How are you doing?

18:19.680 --> 18:20.400
Doing good.

18:20.800 --> 18:21.800
Thanks for having me on, man.

18:22.120 --> 18:23.520
Yeah, you're welcome, bro.

18:23.520 --> 18:26.640
So you're in, um, you're not at your office office.

18:26.640 --> 18:27.720
Looks like you're at your home office.

18:27.720 --> 18:29.280
Cause we did this call so early.

18:29.840 --> 18:30.440
Right?

18:31.960 --> 18:35.440
Oh, this is the new office is actually a house.

18:35.440 --> 18:38.760
So we bought like an acre, put a sweet house on it.

18:38.760 --> 18:40.400
And this is the new office, man.

18:40.480 --> 18:42.320
It's like, yeah, a house on some land.

18:42.720 --> 18:43.160
Hold on.

18:43.200 --> 18:47.200
So when you say we, was that you and your wife, you and a partner?

18:48.880 --> 18:49.160
Oh yeah.

18:49.160 --> 18:49.400
Sorry.

18:49.400 --> 18:52.080
Me and my wife, we just wanted some land.

18:52.080 --> 18:56.680
So we bought some land and built basically like a new office on the, on the place.

18:57.360 --> 18:59.240
Dude, I love, I love the humility, bro.

18:59.240 --> 19:02.000
So you bought an, you, you built a new house using money that you made

19:02.000 --> 19:03.760
from freaking slinging deals.

19:05.400 --> 19:06.240
Yeah, basically.

19:07.160 --> 19:07.960
That's sick, dude.

19:08.160 --> 19:08.760
When did you guys move?

19:10.960 --> 19:11.960
It was like a month ago.

19:12.240 --> 19:12.800
That's great.

19:13.040 --> 19:13.960
Well, congrats, man.

19:13.960 --> 19:17.200
Is that the, your, your first, like official house house, or have you guys,

19:17.240 --> 19:18.120
is this like second?

19:20.280 --> 19:21.600
Uh, number four.

19:22.080 --> 19:23.240
Oh, you guys are movers.

19:23.240 --> 19:24.480
You guys are, you guys move around.

19:24.480 --> 19:24.800
Okay.

19:24.800 --> 19:25.240
Dope.

19:27.480 --> 19:27.840
Yeah.

19:28.000 --> 19:28.800
Yeah, it's been good.

19:29.240 --> 19:29.840
That's cool, man.

19:29.840 --> 19:33.320
Well, anyway, the reason I said that guys is Zach's usually in his office.

19:33.400 --> 19:37.720
Um, but nothing like a home office, dude, wake up, you know, get the shower

19:37.720 --> 19:39.600
really quick and you're at work in five minutes.

19:39.600 --> 19:41.680
So anyway, congrats on that dude.

19:41.680 --> 19:43.080
And I was just given a little intro.

19:43.080 --> 19:45.720
I don't know if you were listening live, but I was just telling everyone,

19:46.080 --> 19:50.080
you know, for those that are new, um, well, first of all, you,

19:50.080 --> 19:51.280
you're still in Phoenix, right?

19:52.920 --> 19:53.440
Yep.

19:53.560 --> 19:53.760
Yeah.

19:53.760 --> 19:56.400
Queen Creek, just outside Phoenix, bro.

19:56.400 --> 19:59.280
That's a, that's a, that's a, you know, that's the city that we cover in

19:59.280 --> 20:00.160
the training, right?

20:01.720 --> 20:02.400
Oh, that's it.

20:02.560 --> 20:02.920
Yeah.

20:02.920 --> 20:04.000
It's a great city.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.920
Tons of people, tons of business owners.

20:06.000 --> 20:06.440
Yeah.

20:06.520 --> 20:10.160
So Zach, Zach was, Zach started in here when we did version one.

20:10.160 --> 20:12.560
So version 2.0, bro, it's Queen Creek.

20:12.560 --> 20:16.960
So, um, we'll make sure to go ahead and saturate Queen Creek for you.

20:17.720 --> 20:18.680
I'm just kidding, bro.

20:19.760 --> 20:21.560
So let's talk about your story.

20:21.600 --> 20:24.840
I know you've shared it before, but just kind of give everyone the, the two

20:24.840 --> 20:29.600
minute version of how we got here to $57,000 per month, where you were at.

20:30.080 --> 20:35.240
And then, um, yeah, like how you, where you were at, how you got into digital.

20:35.480 --> 20:39.960
And then, um, maybe the short version of how you got to $57,000 per month

20:39.960 --> 20:41.960
through simple SEO deals, dude.

20:44.360 --> 20:44.680
Yeah.

20:44.720 --> 20:45.320
Good question.

20:45.320 --> 20:49.840
So brief overview is my dad actually owns a carpet cleaning company.

20:50.400 --> 20:55.800
Um, and he was just overpaying for all this digital marketing stuff for years.

20:56.080 --> 21:01.000
So I started helping him kind of on the side of my job, like three and a half

21:01.040 --> 21:06.760
years ago, and then, you know, helping him get reviews, do a better side,

21:06.760 --> 21:08.240
just kind of helping him.

21:08.240 --> 21:12.680
But then, um, yeah, I bought into your course and realized like, Whoa, this

21:12.680 --> 21:15.280
can go much bigger than just helping my dad.

21:15.760 --> 21:21.280
Um, and so then I started going hard and started building Legion sites, doing

21:21.280 --> 21:23.720
SEO deals, just like anything I can get my hands on.

21:24.080 --> 21:26.400
And then I saw a path to quit my job.

21:26.760 --> 21:29.800
And when I saw that path, I was like, Oh shoot, I'm going to do that.

21:30.280 --> 21:35.320
Um, and I actually got laid off with a bunch of people cause it's like public

21:35.320 --> 21:39.880
company I worked for downsized and I had four months of severance and I was like,

21:40.040 --> 21:45.000
this is my four months to just grind and make as much, get as much monthly

21:45.000 --> 21:48.400
recurring revenue as possible, as quickly as possible to quit my job.

21:48.800 --> 21:52.760
Um, so I was just talking to anybody and any deal I could get, I was, I was

21:52.760 --> 21:57.200
getting my dad's friends and then I'm cold calling and it started just being

21:57.240 --> 21:59.840
where like all these SEO deals were just falling in my lap.

21:59.880 --> 22:01.800
And I was like, I have to do this.

22:02.080 --> 22:09.040
I have to stack these $500 a month deals, $300 or whatever that person wants and

22:09.040 --> 22:10.520
just quickly build their site.

22:10.880 --> 22:15.200
Obviously someone in the Philippines built their site and I'm stacking it up.

22:15.240 --> 22:17.240
So that's what I did.

22:17.560 --> 22:24.640
Um, got to like 6,500 monthly recurring revenue and quit my job or I guess got

22:24.640 --> 22:28.520
laid off, got another job, but quit that within a couple of weeks and just started

22:28.520 --> 22:34.200
going, um, and it's just kind of from there, been explosive.

22:34.200 --> 22:40.280
Like once I hired someone in the Philippines to call businesses for me every

22:40.280 --> 22:46.280
day, now I just talk with business owners all the time and bring them over, bring

22:46.280 --> 22:48.480
them over to me because they're unhappy with their situation.

22:48.920 --> 22:52.360
Now I actually got a year ago, I brought on the sales guy, so I don't do the

22:52.360 --> 22:54.240
sales anymore, but we're growing.

22:54.240 --> 22:57.920
We're at like, yeah, 57,000 monthly recurring revenue, just stacking those

22:57.960 --> 23:01.120
easy wins where it's hilarious.

23:01.120 --> 23:03.280
Like sometimes we do live transfers now.

23:03.280 --> 23:07.200
So like the person in the Philippines will call a business owner and then if

23:07.200 --> 23:10.760
they're like unhappy with their website, they'll just live transfer to my sales

23:10.760 --> 23:16.360
guy and sometimes like within 45 minutes, it goes from cold call deal closed.

23:16.440 --> 23:21.120
Now we have a new client because all the work is after they pay, which that's

23:21.120 --> 23:23.840
kind of fun, but yeah, it's just, it's just stacking.

23:23.840 --> 23:28.600
And now, um, systems are built pretty well and it just keeps growing.

23:28.800 --> 23:30.200
So that's exciting.

23:30.240 --> 23:32.000
That's kind of the story in a nutshell.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.560
Yeah, it's been, it's been a ride.

23:33.560 --> 23:34.280
That's been fun.

23:34.520 --> 23:34.880
Yeah.

23:34.880 --> 23:38.080
And obviously there's so many details that you weren't able to cover there,

23:38.080 --> 23:39.280
but that's in a nutshell.

23:39.280 --> 23:43.240
And that's why I called this live like brick by brick, because, you know, I

23:43.240 --> 23:47.880
think sometimes we see people, they grow really rapidly and sometimes they

23:48.120 --> 23:51.320
land a monster client and it completely, like I've heard of people getting

23:51.320 --> 23:55.680
like these franchise deals and then they add like 20, 30,000 revenue, right?

23:56.080 --> 23:59.760
Um, which is great, but the way that Zach's built his business is literally

23:59.760 --> 24:03.760
brick by brick, $500 a month, $700 a month, $300 a month.

24:04.040 --> 24:09.440
So if tomorrow Zach had five people call him and cancel, that's not really

24:09.440 --> 24:11.240
going to do that much to his business.

24:11.240 --> 24:16.080
He's still going to be at the same spot and that's a really comfortable place to

24:16.080 --> 24:19.160
be. It's a really free, mentally free place to be.

24:19.160 --> 24:24.200
So, um, for those that have never heard you before, I want you to kind of just

24:24.200 --> 24:27.640
give an outline of like your process, what you guys are doing.

24:27.640 --> 24:29.240
You don't need to give too many details.

24:30.160 --> 24:34.760
Um, but just like how you guys are getting these deals, because right now

24:34.760 --> 24:38.880
you're, you're removed from the equation, which is you've done it really well.

24:39.200 --> 24:42.880
And so now you have this team, you have this system where, and I'm not going to

24:42.920 --> 24:47.160
like, I'm going to let you talk about it, but you guys are, are finding certain

24:47.160 --> 24:51.200
people, you're, you're cold calling using a certain, uh, type of person.

24:51.520 --> 24:55.000
And then you have a, like, just kind of explain how you're going about getting

24:55.000 --> 24:57.360
deals from like a high level overview.

24:59.520 --> 24:59.960
Totally.

24:59.960 --> 25:06.720
So it's actually crazy how many companies are unhappy with just their website and

25:06.720 --> 25:09.040
their, their online presence, their SEO.

25:09.400 --> 25:11.760
And so we just target those people.

25:11.800 --> 25:16.520
Like, we'll just get a big list of like electricians or a big list of

25:16.520 --> 25:22.200
plumbers or a big list of everybody who uses a certain marketing company

25:22.240 --> 25:23.280
that we know sucks.

25:23.280 --> 25:28.120
We go to their website and see, Oh, their pricing is $800 a month and they're

25:28.120 --> 25:30.800
terrible and they have 5,000 clients.

25:31.040 --> 25:34.720
We'll grab their client list, call all those guys and just bring them over,

25:34.720 --> 25:35.800
bring them over, bring them over.

25:36.200 --> 25:42.320
Um, so essentially the whole concept or a big piece of the concept is like

25:43.000 --> 25:48.440
having offshore talent that speak perfect English, calling business owners,

25:49.040 --> 25:50.600
finding people who are unhappy.

25:51.080 --> 25:55.400
It's a super short script that we have, but like, they just find the unhappy

25:55.400 --> 25:58.080
clients, unhappy business owners.

25:58.520 --> 26:01.120
They talk with our sales guys and we bring them over.

26:01.520 --> 26:06.520
Um, and it's, it's an easy pitch because they've already been thinking

26:06.520 --> 26:10.320
about switching, like they don't like who they have, like there's so many

26:10.320 --> 26:15.520
pain points and we just find one pain point and then, you know, we just

26:15.560 --> 26:16.760
transfer them over to us.

26:17.040 --> 26:21.440
So when I was in college, like I sold direct TV door to door.

26:21.840 --> 26:27.360
And when I sold direct TV, all my sales were people who had dish network or

26:27.360 --> 26:32.000
AT&T U-verse and switched them to direct TV to save them money and give them

26:32.000 --> 26:32.880
like more channels.

26:33.280 --> 26:37.400
And so that clicked with me in digital marketing.

26:37.400 --> 26:42.040
And I was like, because the issue for almost everybody, like I guess in the

26:42.040 --> 26:47.760
chat, like guys in the chat, just write down like, what is the hardest part

26:47.760 --> 26:48.680
of growth for you?

26:48.760 --> 26:52.920
I'm like curious, like what people struggle with when it comes to growth,

26:53.280 --> 26:56.280
like in the chat, light it up if you want and I'll read, I have it up right

26:56.280 --> 27:01.120
here, but generally it's in a couple buckets for most people.

27:02.000 --> 27:05.200
But yeah, just throw in the chat what, why you struggle with growth.

27:05.680 --> 27:08.600
For me, it was sales.

27:09.000 --> 27:13.880
And I was like, I'm having trouble like actually collecting money.

27:14.720 --> 27:17.280
And that made me really mad because I was just like grinding, grinding,

27:17.280 --> 27:19.400
grinding, but I wasn't collecting money.

27:19.640 --> 27:20.840
And I was like, this freaking sucks.

27:20.840 --> 27:22.160
I don't want to work for nothing.

27:22.520 --> 27:24.800
And so I was like, what is the easiest deal possible?

27:25.520 --> 27:29.720
And I thought back to my direct TV days and I was like, the easiest sale for

27:29.720 --> 27:33.800
me to quit my job and start getting a little bit of money coming in as I'm

27:33.800 --> 27:36.080
starting out was just a transfer.

27:36.280 --> 27:40.040
If I can save someone money and give them a better product, that's

27:40.040 --> 27:41.080
just like an easy switch.

27:41.080 --> 27:45.640
They're already paying 500 bucks a month, 800 bucks a month, 400 bucks a month.

27:45.880 --> 27:49.920
If I can just switch that to me, but give them better service, it's an easy switch.

27:50.320 --> 27:56.280
And so I realized that there's actually thousands of business owners in the

27:56.280 --> 28:02.480
U S paying big marketing companies and those marketing companies are doing a

28:02.480 --> 28:06.920
terrible job and why don't I just like steal a little bit of their thousands

28:06.920 --> 28:11.080
and thousands of clients, why don't I just take a little piece and just keep

28:11.080 --> 28:12.720
doing that until I quit my job.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
So that's what I did.

28:14.280 --> 28:17.280
Um, Spencer saying sales for sure.

28:17.280 --> 28:22.520
I mean, I think most people think that like the hardest part of growth is sales.

28:22.920 --> 28:27.960
So thinking of direct TV, I was like, if I can make easy switches, that's so easy.

28:28.400 --> 28:33.400
Um, and so that's how we set everything up, calling business owners, finding

28:33.400 --> 28:37.920
unhappy ones, and then our pitch is essentially doing them our research.

28:37.920 --> 28:42.240
Like everyone's doing due diligence, you know, that skill set you guys already

28:42.240 --> 28:46.560
have, it's essentially just doing due diligence for that company and their

28:46.560 --> 28:51.000
business and explaining, oh yeah, your website, your online presence isn't

28:51.000 --> 28:52.800
good because of these things.

28:53.320 --> 28:57.760
Um, we can do a much better job than whoever you have now that doesn't care.

28:57.960 --> 29:02.800
Now they have a small business, this, you care about them and they just switch to

29:02.800 --> 29:05.120
you and you're just stacking that monthly current revenue.

29:05.520 --> 29:07.760
So that's what it's been like for me.

29:09.200 --> 29:11.800
And, uh, go tying that into the training.

29:11.800 --> 29:12.240
It's funny.

29:12.240 --> 29:16.120
So, cause some of you guys may know I had a background in door to door

29:16.120 --> 29:20.080
sales as well, and we, we, we learned the same thing, uh, Zach sold TV.

29:20.080 --> 29:24.720
I sold alarm systems, but, uh, it didn't take long before you realized, Hey, if I

29:24.720 --> 29:28.440
knock on a door that doesn't have an alarm system, I have to sell them on the

29:28.440 --> 29:31.440
idea of having home security, adding a bill.

29:31.720 --> 29:34.880
And on top of that, I have to convince them they should use my company.

29:35.280 --> 29:39.600
And then you knock on that door that already has another company, ADT, and all

29:39.600 --> 29:43.440
you have to do is convince them to pay their money to you instead of the other

29:43.440 --> 29:43.960
company.

29:44.280 --> 29:48.400
And instead of having an hour and 15 minute sale, it was like a 20 minute

29:48.400 --> 29:50.600
sale, not emotional, logical.

29:50.600 --> 29:51.640
Oh, that makes sense.

29:51.680 --> 29:53.200
Same price or less.

29:53.200 --> 29:55.440
And I get all this extra stuff, better service.

29:55.480 --> 29:57.360
Yeah, that's, that's a no brainer.

29:57.720 --> 30:02.880
So that's why, when we talk about building the list, we go after people who

30:02.880 --> 30:05.400
are already paying for these services in a similar way.

30:05.400 --> 30:06.800
Zach's doing that exact same thing.

30:06.800 --> 30:07.880
Those are the people that he's targeting.

30:07.880 --> 30:13.360
So here's the misconception that I always had about SEO is I did it and I

30:13.360 --> 30:17.680
did it incorrectly because when I did SEO, I was such, it was such a desperate

30:17.680 --> 30:18.280
spot.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.400
I didn't have severance pay.

30:20.400 --> 30:24.360
I just like, I was on the tail end of a failed business, right?

30:24.360 --> 30:25.960
So you were a little bit smarter.

30:25.960 --> 30:28.840
You had like a little bit of a runway and you were smart about it.

30:28.840 --> 30:30.440
And me, I just like failed the business.

30:30.440 --> 30:31.880
And I was like, I need money today.

30:32.360 --> 30:35.400
So any money I was taking, I had a restaurant client.

30:35.720 --> 30:44.160
I had a, like a band, like a wedding band that played like music at weddings, dude.

30:44.160 --> 30:50.600
I had all kinds of weird clients and I could never sell them Legion A, B, I

30:50.600 --> 30:52.560
didn't, none of them had commonalities.

30:52.560 --> 30:54.360
There was all these just like unknowns.

30:54.360 --> 30:55.680
They were all over the country.

30:55.880 --> 30:57.800
I had just a bunch of weird stuff.

30:57.800 --> 31:00.160
I was trying to get the biggest deals possible.

31:01.000 --> 31:04.480
I was convincing people who weren't doing SEO to do SEO.

31:04.920 --> 31:10.080
And I just had this weird smorgasbord of, of a portfolio of SEO.

31:10.320 --> 31:15.320
And I also had big, like I had this client that was, this is when I decided SEO is

31:15.480 --> 31:19.200
not my game, which I've changed my mind on it for sure.

31:19.240 --> 31:24.120
Otherwise I wouldn't have brought Zach on here, but I was in, I was in a SeaWorld.

31:24.200 --> 31:26.240
Zach, you've been to SeaWorld with the kids yet, bro?

31:27.680 --> 31:28.680
San Diego?

31:28.880 --> 31:29.360
Yeah.

31:30.800 --> 31:33.120
I haven't been there, but driven past it to the beach.

31:33.240 --> 31:33.800
Yeah, dude.

31:34.320 --> 31:35.440
It's a scam, bro.

31:35.440 --> 31:38.240
It's a, especially if you've been to Disneyland, you go to SeaWorld and you're

31:38.240 --> 31:42.120
like, bro, this is like the, the wish.com version of Disneyland.

31:42.600 --> 31:45.000
Um, it was cool when I was a kid.

31:45.000 --> 31:45.720
It's not anymore.

31:45.720 --> 31:46.000
No.

31:46.240 --> 31:50.320
Uh, anyway, I'm at SeaWorld with the kids and I get this call from my

31:50.320 --> 31:53.560
client and keep in mind, I only got like six, seven clients at the time.

31:53.560 --> 31:55.960
And this client was paying me $4,000 a month.

31:56.440 --> 31:56.880
Okay.

31:57.040 --> 31:58.880
Also, I was going into really hard niches.

31:58.880 --> 32:01.000
I was, it was a foundation repair client.

32:01.480 --> 32:04.920
And dude, I just knew when I saw the call, I'm like, this guy's going to cancel.

32:05.200 --> 32:07.920
And that's going to be literally at the time that was almost half of my revenue.

32:07.960 --> 32:09.360
It was half of my revenue.

32:09.800 --> 32:14.360
Took the call, dude, missed the whale show, go out over and he's

32:14.360 --> 32:16.320
like, yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm done, dude.

32:16.320 --> 32:17.720
It just ruined my vacation.

32:17.720 --> 32:17.920
Right.

32:17.920 --> 32:20.520
I'm like, you know, you're like sitting there cringing when you're

32:20.520 --> 32:24.600
getting the churros now, cause the $5 churros, like it feels a lot more

32:24.600 --> 32:26.600
expensive than it did.

32:27.160 --> 32:29.680
And I was just like, dude, this isn't going to work for me.

32:29.680 --> 32:33.480
But the mistake that I made is I didn't have a criteria.

32:33.520 --> 32:35.480
Similarly to you guys have heard my story.

32:35.680 --> 32:38.880
I tell you guys when you're doing lead generation, go into the boring

32:38.880 --> 32:41.480
niches, go into these niches that are tried and true.

32:41.760 --> 32:45.720
Zach's does, he has a very strict criteria for who he works with.

32:46.080 --> 32:50.240
He's he, he, he, he's got all these different like boxes that have to be

32:50.240 --> 32:53.960
checked and if they're checked, that's his person he's going to go in.

32:54.040 --> 32:54.960
He's going to get the deal.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.800
He already knows everything about who they're working with, where

32:57.800 --> 32:58.880
the pain points are.

32:59.200 --> 33:02.160
And on top of that, he set up a system where he doesn't even have to do it.

33:02.400 --> 33:07.440
So what I want you guys to understand is if you are going to do SEO, there's

33:07.440 --> 33:11.280
a strategic way to do it and I want you guys to remember people that need

33:11.280 --> 33:15.960
SEO only want SEO because they want, generally speaking, want phone calls.

33:16.280 --> 33:20.720
So if you can get somebody on an SEO deal, you could turn around and you

33:20.720 --> 33:23.480
could sell them lead generation if they're the right client.

33:23.480 --> 33:27.240
Now, if you go get a restaurant deal, it's going to be difficult to sell

33:27.240 --> 33:28.960
them lead generation, if not impossible.

33:28.960 --> 33:33.240
If you go get an e-comm company that you're ranking their website for

33:33.240 --> 33:36.680
this specific product, first of all, that's going to be tough, but it's

33:36.680 --> 33:38.120
going to be tough to sell leads.

33:38.440 --> 33:41.600
But if you do what Zach does, he targets home service businesses in certain

33:41.600 --> 33:46.200
niches that are unhappy at a certain price point, dude, he's just like, it's

33:46.200 --> 33:48.560
like a shooting fish in a barrel.

33:48.680 --> 33:49.520
You know what I mean?

33:49.840 --> 33:52.560
Um, and so anyway, I want you guys to understand that.

33:52.560 --> 33:58.480
Now, Zach, I know I'm going to forget about this, but Zach, he's he grab your

33:58.480 --> 34:02.000
link because I know you did like a webinar like a year ago or maybe like

34:02.000 --> 34:08.080
six, seven months ago, so Zach started doing this and he had a couple of

34:08.080 --> 34:11.480
buddies, just like I did, they were like, dude, what, like, I'm sure they

34:11.480 --> 34:15.040
were looking at you like, whoa, dude, like how's your, your situation change.

34:15.040 --> 34:16.600
And I know you're not a flashy person.

34:16.600 --> 34:20.760
So they, they probably took a while for them to catch on, but, uh, they were

34:20.760 --> 34:21.600
like, what are you doing?

34:21.600 --> 34:22.600
And Zach started helping.

34:22.600 --> 34:25.160
I think it was like his brother-in-law and his buddy, and then they

34:25.160 --> 34:26.120
started having success.

34:26.120 --> 34:29.120
And so he ended up starting and he put together a training where he

34:29.120 --> 34:30.120
actually has his own thing.

34:30.120 --> 34:31.280
He teaches people how to do this.

34:31.280 --> 34:37.200
So, um, Zach, I do want you to drop that webinar if you would in the chat.

34:37.640 --> 34:39.040
And then I'll pin that.

34:39.760 --> 34:42.960
So for those of you guys that are like, Hey, you want to learn more and, and

34:42.960 --> 34:46.080
see what Zach's up to click on that, watch the webinar.

34:46.080 --> 34:48.160
It's very cut and dry to the point.

34:48.360 --> 34:52.240
Um, I'm actually, uh, I'm actually in that it's I've been through it.

34:52.240 --> 34:53.600
It's really, really solid.

34:53.600 --> 34:56.480
And there's a lot of stuff that you can also use for lead generation, just the

34:56.480 --> 34:58.720
concepts and the systems and everything.

34:59.040 --> 35:02.880
Um, but, uh, so yeah, drop that.

35:02.880 --> 35:06.520
And then we're going to get into Q and a here in a second, but, um, tell everyone

35:06.520 --> 35:09.040
like what your team looks like.

35:09.040 --> 35:12.600
This is what's, I think so impressive dude is like two questions that we're

35:12.600 --> 35:14.760
going to get into Q and a, what does your team look like?

35:14.840 --> 35:18.600
And then what is your day to day look like right now at $57,000 per month?

35:20.920 --> 35:21.760
Awesome question.

35:21.800 --> 35:23.360
So yeah, first I just put the link.

35:23.400 --> 35:25.600
It's actually just Zach Powell.co.

35:26.160 --> 35:29.680
Um, it's just like a, I built in like five minutes.

35:29.680 --> 35:32.400
It looks retarded, but it has two videos.

35:32.800 --> 35:35.320
So the first one just shows like my strike page.

35:35.520 --> 35:38.960
So like, you guys actually know I'm not just like some fake dude.

35:39.280 --> 35:40.200
It shows my strike page.

35:40.200 --> 35:43.080
And I talk about like each of the steps and kind of what I learned.

35:43.480 --> 35:49.080
Um, and then the next one, um, I explained more about like what I teach

35:49.160 --> 35:53.160
and the success of people, like the first beginning students, whatever.

35:53.560 --> 35:56.640
Um, but yeah, check out that link if you want.

35:57.040 --> 36:02.440
Uh, but yeah, so first my team, um, and I'll kind of answer this in phases.

36:02.440 --> 36:06.560
So when I started out, it was just me obviously doing everything.

36:06.960 --> 36:11.240
And then I hired, um, an appointment center or an SDR in the Philippines.

36:11.600 --> 36:13.960
And he just started calling people every day.

36:14.080 --> 36:18.440
And that's what just really got us going because now I could talk

36:18.440 --> 36:21.520
to way more business owners and therefore close way more deals.

36:21.840 --> 36:26.200
So from there, hired a couple more appointment setters, hired, um,

36:27.000 --> 36:29.640
website builders first, just hourly.

36:29.640 --> 36:33.760
Cause it was super cheap, like four or $5 an hour.

36:34.000 --> 36:38.240
And now these people would build my websites in like eight to 10 hours,

36:38.400 --> 36:39.400
brand new website.

36:39.640 --> 36:41.280
And I paid like 40 bucks for it.

36:41.280 --> 36:42.000
It's crazy.

36:42.440 --> 36:47.120
So I added website builders, then added like citation builders,

36:47.560 --> 36:50.840
um, added, um, SEO specialists.

36:51.200 --> 36:56.320
So now the team, we have, uh, 23 people.

36:56.920 --> 37:01.960
There's like, uh, you know, six SDRs calling business owners.

37:02.280 --> 37:07.320
There's, um, about six SEO specialists, four website builders,

37:07.920 --> 37:09.640
like a support email support.

37:10.160 --> 37:13.880
Um, and yeah, so that's, that's basically the team.

37:14.120 --> 37:16.240
About 23 of us for all of that.

37:16.240 --> 37:17.800
Is that all out overseas?

37:20.320 --> 37:24.760
It's all overseas except the sales guy, um, is here in the office with me in

37:24.760 --> 37:30.600
Arizona, and then, um, I actually have like, uh, like general manager basically

37:31.200 --> 37:33.840
in the U S as well, that kind of like manages the whole team.

37:34.200 --> 37:41.920
So my day to day, um, I mean, it's kind of lie, dude.

37:43.680 --> 37:46.360
Cause like we were going to do this call last week.

37:47.120 --> 37:48.360
He's like, I'm out for the week.

37:48.360 --> 37:51.160
And I didn't even ask, but I bet I guarantee you were doing something

37:51.160 --> 37:52.520
adventurous like that, right?

37:54.040 --> 37:54.240
Yeah.

37:54.240 --> 37:58.400
I just went on like a surf trip to Nicaragua for a week, which was insane.

37:58.680 --> 38:02.520
Um, I love not biking, but essentially, um,

38:03.960 --> 38:10.320
like all of these systems are now built where I'm not doing any of

38:10.320 --> 38:13.280
like the day to day stuff that's all covered.

38:13.760 --> 38:19.320
My mind is purely focused on like new strategies and growth and like, um,

38:20.000 --> 38:22.200
and helping my team Excel.

38:22.440 --> 38:26.040
So like, I love training my team because these are people that

38:26.040 --> 38:32.160
are making $500 a month, but now they can have like the best training in the world.

38:32.280 --> 38:36.280
You know, I'm, I pay for other mentors, big money to like learn

38:36.280 --> 38:37.240
the best of the best.

38:37.480 --> 38:40.560
And then I bring that to like my group and my employees.

38:40.800 --> 38:44.200
And so that's what I love doing now is like helping individual cause

38:44.200 --> 38:47.400
they're like, if your employees grow as people, they're going

38:47.400 --> 38:48.400
to help your business more.

38:48.400 --> 38:50.400
So I'm training my employees.

38:50.640 --> 38:52.600
I'm training my group, my connections.

38:52.600 --> 38:56.880
Like I'm just helping everyone elevate and distributing that knowledge.

38:57.520 --> 38:58.520
I love doing that.

38:58.520 --> 39:03.320
And then I love like analyzing businesses or like aspects of the

39:03.320 --> 39:04.880
business and improving those things.

39:05.200 --> 39:12.760
So like now we have a head of digital marketing, like a head of our SEO team,

39:13.040 --> 39:16.120
who's like way smarter than me when it comes to SEO.

39:16.400 --> 39:19.960
And, you know, I talk with him once a week and we just like bounce ideas off

39:19.960 --> 39:23.480
each other and then he goes and implements these new strategies to serve

39:23.480 --> 39:25.840
our clients even better on the sales side.

39:25.840 --> 39:26.960
I love thinking about sales.

39:26.960 --> 39:28.400
I'm like, how can we be more effective?

39:28.760 --> 39:34.280
So we used to, our SDRs used to set appointments for our closer, but

39:34.280 --> 39:35.640
now it's just a live transfer.

39:35.920 --> 39:39.120
They have them on the phone and boom, live transfer and the account

39:39.120 --> 39:41.600
executive takes over and it helps our conversion rates.

39:41.600 --> 39:46.320
So just looking at stuff like that and continually improving the business.

39:46.320 --> 39:48.320
It's how I spend my, my day to day.

39:48.520 --> 39:49.720
And it's pretty dang fun.

39:49.720 --> 39:54.480
Like it's fun in the beginning cause it's like life or death and you

39:54.480 --> 39:56.080
just got to keep adding those deals.

39:56.120 --> 40:01.680
And now this day is more like, um, I got to look inward and become a better

40:01.680 --> 40:03.480
leader because that's what I'm doing.

40:03.480 --> 40:08.000
So I'm really focused on like personal growth, helping my team grow training

40:08.000 --> 40:10.040
and implementing new processes.

40:10.040 --> 40:13.560
And the more I can learn, the more I can implement in my company, which

40:13.560 --> 40:14.920
is a pretty fun spot to be.

40:15.000 --> 40:19.760
So, yeah, so you went from like day to day in the business and now you've

40:19.760 --> 40:23.320
been able to extract yourself and most of your time's on the business, right?

40:23.360 --> 40:28.520
Kind of strategic decisions and, you know, visionary, where's the company

40:28.520 --> 40:29.400
going, all that kind of stuff.

40:29.400 --> 40:31.120
And that, that to me is the fun stuff.

40:31.120 --> 40:32.680
I do actually believe it or not.

40:33.040 --> 40:36.320
When I do get in the weeds, I have fun because it's exciting.

40:36.320 --> 40:39.120
I kind of like makes you, you know, like when you were doing door to door sales

40:39.120 --> 40:41.320
and then you were like a trainer, whatever.

40:41.560 --> 40:44.200
And then it's like, it's so fun to get back in with the reps and

40:44.200 --> 40:45.840
like, go close the deal.

40:46.040 --> 40:46.280
Right.

40:46.280 --> 40:48.600
And I still, dude, I still like to do that to this day.

40:48.840 --> 40:54.000
Francesca closes most of our deals, um, you know, on the agency side.

40:54.000 --> 40:57.840
And then for the program side is Kyle, but I'll jump on, I was on the

40:57.840 --> 41:01.440
phone with Kyle yesterday and I just love to hear people's stories and

41:01.440 --> 41:06.000
like, like that excitement and that also that like people are taking

41:06.000 --> 41:07.160
that step into the unknown.

41:07.160 --> 41:09.960
So, um, but that's a really cool spot that you're in, dude.

41:10.000 --> 41:16.960
Um, real quick, your entire team, apart from your U S based people, how much

41:16.960 --> 41:20.680
are you, basically you have about 20 people that are overseas, roughly.

41:22.920 --> 41:29.040
What's your monthly nut on the 20 people rough, like just guess.

41:30.920 --> 41:36.360
It's like, um, nine or 10,000 a month for like bananas, bro.

41:37.360 --> 41:38.840
That's literally the sound they're living.

41:38.840 --> 41:39.240
Great.

41:39.240 --> 41:41.240
Like they're, they're crushing it.

41:41.320 --> 41:43.680
They're, they're making double, triple one.

41:44.520 --> 41:47.640
Quadruple, like a normal person in the Philippines.

41:47.640 --> 41:48.720
Cause she's so good.

41:49.240 --> 41:52.560
And she's no one else in her family works.

41:52.600 --> 41:56.920
She provides for her parents, her siblings, like everyone around another

41:56.920 --> 42:01.000
guy provides for like his parents, his family, his sister, like they make so

42:01.000 --> 42:05.080
much money that they're able to provide for all these people cause they generally

42:05.080 --> 42:08.040
live in the same house and they're like the breadwinner for like three

42:08.040 --> 42:11.320
generations, their kids, them, and their siblings and their parents.

42:11.320 --> 42:12.960
It's, it's pretty nuts.

42:12.960 --> 42:14.400
So that's awesome.

42:15.280 --> 42:20.520
So I would guess based on what you're telling me out of this 57 grant, what

42:20.520 --> 42:21.760
would you say your profit margin?

42:21.760 --> 42:26.200
Cause that's so guys that there's upsides and downsides to different,

42:26.200 --> 42:29.120
like, uh, this is a, this is the same business.

42:29.120 --> 42:30.600
It's just a different deliverable, right?

42:30.600 --> 42:34.160
Instead of selling the leads, you're selling the service of getting the website

42:34.160 --> 42:36.280
ranked same, same thing you're doing SEO.

42:36.680 --> 42:42.760
Um, but the, the, the downside to SEO is you don't have quite as much control

42:42.760 --> 42:43.840
because you don't own the asset.

42:43.840 --> 42:49.960
However, the upside is you have your profit margins from day one are ridiculous.

42:49.960 --> 42:54.240
Like you're making, like if Zach was doing the work himself, his profit

42:54.240 --> 42:56.240
margins are literally like 99%.

42:56.680 --> 42:58.520
Um, what's your profit?

42:58.520 --> 43:02.160
Would you say on the 57 K it's like, it's gotta be like 80%, right?

43:02.200 --> 43:03.680
75, 80%.

43:05.320 --> 43:06.640
Yeah, it was that for a bit.

43:06.640 --> 43:09.480
I just hired like a bunch of people.

43:09.480 --> 43:15.400
So it was probably like 50% now 40, 40 to 50%, but it's like, I have

43:15.400 --> 43:19.800
two expensive us hires a sales guy, bringing all the sales, a general

43:20.040 --> 43:21.760
manager taking care of everything.

43:22.280 --> 43:26.440
And then after and the team in the Philippines and Pakistan, after that,

43:26.440 --> 43:29.480
it's like, you know, I'm doing what I love.

43:29.480 --> 43:32.480
And I still make that profit, which is pretty cool.

43:32.640 --> 43:38.080
If I, when I was doing the sales, obviously and doing, didn't have the

43:38.080 --> 43:42.800
U S labor, then it was like around 80, 75, 80%.

43:42.920 --> 43:45.320
Now it's about 45%, I'd say.

43:45.680 --> 43:45.920
Yeah.

43:45.920 --> 43:49.400
But, and the thing is though, in order for you to go to a hundred K,

43:49.400 --> 43:50.480
you need those hires.

43:50.480 --> 43:53.760
So you may, it may look like you're taking a step back, but you're just,

43:53.800 --> 43:56.600
you're just basically building that foundation so you can go higher.

43:57.600 --> 43:57.960
Right.

43:58.080 --> 43:58.280
Yeah.

43:58.280 --> 43:59.760
We're in, we're in growth mode now.

43:59.840 --> 44:06.360
Like, um, so yeah, we're going to hit a hundred thousand next year.

44:06.360 --> 44:06.680
So

44:07.360 --> 44:08.640
yeah, I guarantee you.

44:08.640 --> 44:09.200
So, okay.

44:09.200 --> 44:10.240
One last quick question.

44:10.240 --> 44:14.040
I'm going to get into some Q and a, um, the people that you're working with,

44:14.320 --> 44:16.360
what's your top person doing?

44:16.360 --> 44:19.240
Cause I know when we talked like six months ago, one of them was doing

44:19.240 --> 44:21.080
like 15 K or something like that.

44:21.320 --> 44:25.920
Is it like, how many people do you have at 10 K or what's your top person

44:25.920 --> 44:27.320
doing that you're, that you've taught us to.

44:29.720 --> 44:30.840
Oh, like in my course?

44:31.080 --> 44:31.520
Yeah.

44:31.760 --> 44:36.080
Um, actually, actually 54,000.

44:36.080 --> 44:38.640
So that kind of motivated me to get things going.

44:38.640 --> 44:42.160
I'm like, man, people are now going to surpass me.

44:42.360 --> 44:42.960
Which one of them?

44:42.960 --> 44:43.920
Um, that's James.

44:44.280 --> 44:44.680
Okay.

44:44.680 --> 44:45.760
I got James Lincoln.

44:46.640 --> 44:47.040
Yeah.

44:47.320 --> 44:48.040
That's dope, dude.

44:48.040 --> 44:55.520
Um, Mitch Mitch is like over 20 or 30,000 Vinny's over 20 and he's over 20.

44:55.520 --> 44:59.600
Like there's a lot of guys crushing it, but when James started approaching me,

44:59.880 --> 45:01.040
he's like a good friend of mine.

45:01.040 --> 45:04.640
I'm like, dude, I gotta ramp things up and not just like coast.

45:05.040 --> 45:06.640
I love, I love that.

45:06.640 --> 45:10.800
Well, that's a, that's always, he started like a year and a half ago.

45:11.160 --> 45:16.160
Um, and like part-time with his doing his MBA and having a different job at

45:16.160 --> 45:18.120
the same time, but he's crushing it.

45:18.600 --> 45:23.320
Um, I launched the course a year and a half ago.

45:23.320 --> 45:28.360
So if, and the reason I'm asking him this guy's again, this, this is,

45:28.360 --> 45:31.280
if you want to check out his site, I pinned it at the top.

45:32.080 --> 45:33.680
I love Zach's thing.

45:33.680 --> 45:36.400
Cause it's literally like, like he said, it's like a video or two.

45:36.760 --> 45:38.360
And, um, he just talked to him.

45:38.520 --> 45:41.000
He just shows the proof and then he's like, here's my system.

45:41.000 --> 45:42.560
And if you guys want to check it out, here it is.

45:42.880 --> 45:44.760
But, um, I've talked to some of these guys.

45:44.760 --> 45:48.400
I know like what they're up to is I get, it's got my stamp on it.

45:48.400 --> 45:51.760
And so I guess I would say anybody that's in a situation where like

45:51.760 --> 45:57.680
you need to quit your job, um, today, uh, that's something you

45:57.680 --> 45:59.240
should, you should consider looking into.

45:59.240 --> 46:02.200
And it's something you can do in tandem with what we're doing again.

46:02.200 --> 46:06.120
I don't want you to just go picking up random SEO clients, fricking

46:06.320 --> 46:11.240
restaurant this and, um, you know, whatever, try to be strategic.

46:11.240 --> 46:14.440
Like if you're going to get an SEO client and your long-term goal is to do

46:14.440 --> 46:18.000
lead gen, think about, okay, I want to get into these niches.

46:18.000 --> 46:18.840
I want to be in fencing.

46:18.840 --> 46:20.200
I want to be in duck cleaning.

46:20.200 --> 46:22.000
I want to be in tree service, et cetera.

46:22.000 --> 46:25.760
Go get SEO clients in those niches because you can then go and sell

46:25.760 --> 46:27.720
them lead generation on the backend.

46:28.120 --> 46:31.000
And one thing that Zach hasn't even really tapped into in one of these

46:31.000 --> 46:36.520
days, I'm just going to go buy his list is, um, he hasn't even like, to my

46:36.520 --> 46:40.640
knowledge, you haven't really gone and like sold these guys like lead generation.

46:40.640 --> 46:42.200
It's mainly just been the SEO, right?

46:44.200 --> 46:48.040
Mainly the SEO, but it's hilarious how easy it would be.

46:48.040 --> 46:50.960
I just need to set up the systems because people ask me all the time,

46:50.960 --> 46:54.520
like, Hey, uh, yeah, we want to get more leads.

46:54.520 --> 46:56.840
Like, can you help us set up Google ads?

46:56.840 --> 46:58.640
And I'm like, ding, ding, ding.

46:58.640 --> 47:00.480
There's a lead gen client, you know?

47:00.920 --> 47:03.640
Um, but yeah, I just need to implement those, those systems.

47:03.920 --> 47:08.000
We've been working on like a lot of automations and stuff, which is good too.

47:08.000 --> 47:13.560
But yeah, essentially like when you're, if you guys are focusing on.

47:14.240 --> 47:19.640
Like, let's say artificial turf or concrete or bathroom remodels

47:19.640 --> 47:20.840
or whatever your niche is, like.

47:21.680 --> 47:24.480
You can do, this is a, this is a pro tip right here.

47:24.920 --> 47:26.680
There's this thing called outscraper.

47:27.480 --> 47:32.680
Um, and you can, it can pull like thousands of businesses

47:33.000 --> 47:34.800
from Google business profiles.

47:35.880 --> 47:46.240
So use outscraper, grab a list of 5,000, um, concrete companies and have an

47:46.240 --> 47:51.040
SDR call them, and now you're getting a conversation started and you're

47:51.040 --> 47:53.400
building trust with your core market.

47:54.000 --> 48:00.640
And then the easiest way in the door is to just do a better website for them.

48:00.920 --> 48:02.720
They already have a website there to pay for it.

48:03.160 --> 48:05.600
Um, and you can just make it way better.

48:06.160 --> 48:08.800
And now they trust you and now your foot's in the door.

48:08.800 --> 48:10.720
You're already making money from them day one.

48:10.960 --> 48:12.280
Now you can quit your job.

48:12.600 --> 48:16.160
And in your mind, you're like, dude, I already have this connection.

48:16.240 --> 48:18.360
I've already pre-sold it, right?

48:18.360 --> 48:20.880
Like Nick's all about the art of pre-selling.

48:21.080 --> 48:24.440
You basically have a pre-sale because you have this client in your pocket.

48:25.120 --> 48:26.480
They're a concrete company.

48:26.840 --> 48:27.680
They trust you.

48:28.160 --> 48:29.320
They're already paying you.

48:29.600 --> 48:34.600
You know, you have the insights to like how much work they can handle, how

48:34.600 --> 48:38.080
they're growing, like how many jobs they can handle each month.

48:38.520 --> 48:40.760
And you just crush it for them.

48:40.800 --> 48:43.040
And then you're like, Hey, do you want more jobs?

48:43.440 --> 48:46.440
A lot of business owners do Google ads, do whatever.

48:46.680 --> 48:52.200
I actually have leads that are only for you ready to go 10 a month.

48:52.240 --> 48:53.600
And I'll sell them to you for this much.

48:53.760 --> 48:55.840
I'm going to, I was going to sell them to another guy, but I'm glad that

48:55.840 --> 48:57.840
I actually know you because now I can sell them to you.

48:58.000 --> 48:58.480
Do you want them?

48:58.480 --> 49:00.960
You have first right of refusal on these leads.

49:01.800 --> 49:03.480
Of course you're going to take those jobs, right?

49:03.640 --> 49:04.800
It's like the easiest sale up.

49:05.160 --> 49:11.280
So yeah, check out outscraper, check out that system, check out the videos on my,

49:11.640 --> 49:14.160
on my page, I think you guys will get some good thoughts going.

49:14.160 --> 49:19.280
So the other thing, other reason I wanted to have Zach is even if you guys don't

49:19.280 --> 49:22.520
take anything else from this call, because you choose not to, because you

49:22.520 --> 49:26.960
should be taking some nuggets is like, you guys need to realize that there's

49:27.640 --> 49:31.400
like, once you get into a business, cause you guys are in digital landlords.

49:31.800 --> 49:35.280
I've got, I've shown you guys exactly the system that I've used, exactly how I

49:35.280 --> 49:38.200
was able to get to a hundred thousand dollars per month, but as you get going,

49:38.920 --> 49:42.360
you start to see opportunities that you had no idea were there.

49:42.400 --> 49:48.840
So like, I'm pretty sure when Zach started, um, he, you know, got done with

49:48.840 --> 49:50.400
college or whatever, did you graduate college?

49:50.400 --> 49:51.800
You, you got a degree, right?

49:52.960 --> 49:53.360
Yeah.

49:53.600 --> 49:53.880
Okay.

49:54.000 --> 49:54.120
Yeah.

49:54.120 --> 49:55.920
I studied business at BYU.

49:56.240 --> 49:56.680
Okay.

49:56.720 --> 50:00.920
So yeah, I, I'm guessing you probably didn't imagine yourself like managing

50:00.920 --> 50:06.120
websites for small businesses, like whatever you probably just, it was not

50:06.120 --> 50:08.960
even on your radar, but then you get going, you start doing, and then you

50:08.960 --> 50:14.400
see an opportunity and boom, now you're making $57,000 a month, managing

50:14.680 --> 50:19.120
SEO for small businesses and you have a team of 20 plus people and you're

50:19.120 --> 50:23.240
making, you know, a lot of money, you live in the life you want to live.

50:23.240 --> 50:24.400
And it's just, it's exciting.

50:24.400 --> 50:26.960
So, um, guys, people like,

50:28.720 --> 50:36.280
one last thought that I'll share is, um, it's actually crazy how many clients

50:36.280 --> 50:39.840
we have that don't really care that much about SEO.

50:40.720 --> 50:43.800
They like went with us because they just wanted a better looking website.

50:44.440 --> 50:48.720
And those clients, I saw someone in the chat asked like about our retention.

50:49.640 --> 50:55.080
Um, I've been doing this for like about two and a half years, like focusing on

50:55.080 --> 51:01.480
this and we have clients that we've had for over a year, over two years because

51:02.240 --> 51:05.040
they just like us, they like the look of their site.

51:05.600 --> 51:09.080
They get most of their business from word of mouth anyway, but they

51:09.080 --> 51:10.240
just want to be online.

51:10.480 --> 51:14.760
And so like the SEO is like low priority for them.

51:14.800 --> 51:18.800
So yeah, we're doing it and we're, we're doing the SEO, but they

51:18.800 --> 51:19.640
don't actually care about it.

51:19.640 --> 51:23.680
They are basically in their minds, they're just paying 500 bucks a month.

51:24.360 --> 51:27.840
So they have a good looking website and someone that they can email to

51:27.840 --> 51:29.360
make updates whenever they want.

51:30.360 --> 51:34.960
Um, and yeah, like SEO is being done and they have like our expertise.

51:34.960 --> 51:36.680
They can email and say, Hey, what should we do here?

51:36.800 --> 51:40.000
We give them like their Google review links so they can text it out.

51:40.000 --> 51:45.880
Like we do some things for them, but so many of these people are just like,

51:45.920 --> 51:49.960
Oh, I'm just paying 500 bucks a month for my website, 300 bucks, bucks

51:49.960 --> 51:51.080
a month for my website.

51:51.120 --> 51:52.680
That's not something you cancel.

51:53.240 --> 51:55.040
You want to have a website online.

51:55.840 --> 51:58.680
And so it's, it's actually crazy.

51:58.680 --> 52:02.080
Like I could tell, I could fire my whole SEO team.

52:02.320 --> 52:08.760
We could stop making sales and there would still be probably about 10 to

52:08.760 --> 52:13.200
20,000 monthly recurring revenue that would just sit there for years and years

52:13.200 --> 52:17.360
and years because we have their website lives and that's all they care about.

52:17.680 --> 52:19.240
It's pretty crazy.

52:19.440 --> 52:22.520
So there's some people that really care and that, um, you know, we do

52:22.520 --> 52:26.120
obviously do a great job for them, but we even do a great job for people

52:26.120 --> 52:28.080
that don't care, but I just like talking with them.

52:28.080 --> 52:31.640
I just know they're not going to turn cause they just like how their website

52:31.640 --> 52:34.760
looks and they're going to pay us 500 bucks a month because like we're their

52:34.760 --> 52:38.200
online guys and we're their only connection to like the online world.

52:38.720 --> 52:40.400
And it's really weird, man.

52:40.400 --> 52:43.880
Like you get those, you get those deals and you kind of know them.

52:43.920 --> 52:49.520
And I'm like, this is the easiest craziest thing in the world, but they love

52:49.520 --> 52:53.680
it because they feel confident in us taking care of it all really well.

52:54.080 --> 52:54.440
So

52:54.680 --> 52:57.680
these are like people that have just decided that they're just going to have

52:57.680 --> 53:01.480
that monthly fee forever and they, they, maybe they haven't even consciously

53:01.480 --> 53:03.600
decided, but yeah, to them, that's just how it is.

53:03.600 --> 53:04.360
That's just the fee.

53:04.560 --> 53:07.360
And that's one of the things Zach does really well is he's strategic about the

53:07.360 --> 53:11.400
people that he targets and he's targeting people that are already comfortable with

53:11.400 --> 53:14.720
this bill and, uh, that's what makes the retention.

53:14.720 --> 53:19.120
So again, there's so many, there's so many commonalities with what I talk

53:19.120 --> 53:23.200
about with what Zach's saying is when I always say, Hey, that, you know, the

53:23.200 --> 53:26.760
money's made or lost in picking the right city in the right niche and picking

53:26.760 --> 53:29.200
the business owner, you guys pick the right business owner in the right

53:29.200 --> 53:32.960
city and niche, your retention is going to be so much lower.

53:33.120 --> 53:35.040
You pick a high maintenance business owner.

53:35.560 --> 53:37.720
I don't care how many leads you're piping them full of.

53:37.920 --> 53:39.000
It's going to be difficult.

53:39.000 --> 53:40.800
So it all comes down to how you do that.

53:40.800 --> 53:43.560
And Zach has a really good system for how he selects those people and how

53:43.560 --> 53:44.960
he goes after them, what he says.

53:44.960 --> 53:48.800
And it's from the second you make that initial call until you close the deal.

53:48.800 --> 53:52.000
But, um, anyway, Zach Powell, thanks for jumping on this call, dude.

53:52.040 --> 53:53.040
Really appreciate it.

53:53.080 --> 53:57.080
57 K per month from, uh, from what were you making before?

53:57.280 --> 54:03.040
Around five to seven gross, um, 70,000 a year.

54:03.040 --> 54:05.200
So like $4,500 a month.

54:05.240 --> 54:05.560
Yeah.

54:05.880 --> 54:06.160
Amazing.

54:06.160 --> 54:07.360
Quite a bit different now.

54:07.400 --> 54:07.960
It's crazy.

54:08.720 --> 54:09.400
That's wild.

54:09.640 --> 54:13.400
And, uh, here we are a couple of years later and I've, I've, I've seen

54:13.400 --> 54:17.200
this firsthand in my life and I always say this is like, you're closer than

54:17.200 --> 54:20.120
you think to getting to your, to the goals that you have in the life that

54:20.120 --> 54:21.040
you, that you want.

54:21.040 --> 54:24.120
And it's like, I think it's in this book at the beginning.

54:24.120 --> 54:27.040
It talks about the three feet of being three feet from gold.

54:27.400 --> 54:31.720
Um, I know for me, what eight months before I hit a hundred thousand dollars

54:31.720 --> 54:34.440
a month, I was, I was $60,000 in debt.

54:34.440 --> 54:35.200
I had no idea.

54:35.200 --> 54:38.320
I was almost ready to give up on, on being a business owner.

54:38.640 --> 54:44.240
And, uh, and I know for you, your, your growth was much more like stable and

54:44.240 --> 54:50.080
consistent, but nonetheless, two and a half years ago, you were just paying the

54:50.080 --> 54:54.360
bills and now you're building a new house, going to Nicaragua on a random

54:54.400 --> 54:56.640
October week to, to go surfing, dude.

54:56.640 --> 54:57.480
That's amazing.

54:57.680 --> 54:58.560
I love that, bro.

54:59.200 --> 55:00.000
The waves were good.

55:00.000 --> 55:00.760
So how'd you go?

55:02.040 --> 55:03.080
Well, guys check out that link.

55:03.080 --> 55:03.440
Zach.

55:03.440 --> 55:04.000
It's Zach.

55:04.120 --> 55:06.800
Is it Zachary Powell or Zach Powell doc CEO?

55:07.360 --> 55:08.040
You see what it is?
