1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
Okay, encouragement for members who only have enough positive cashflow to run one campaign

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:09,520
at a time to get clients with, makes things move at a snail's pace.

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:13,760
So yeah, I mean, the way I look at it, guys, is this, right?

4
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:19,240
If you guys get in that situation where you're like, man, of course, Nick can do 24K in a

5
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,240
month.

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,240
He's got money to run.

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,240
I do.

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:29,920
But guys, remember that in 2019, not only did I not have money to run ads, I had $60,000

9
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:30,920
in debt.

10
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,640
And not only did I have $60,000 in debt, I had two car payments and not only did I have

11
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,560
two car payments, I had a house payment and I had a wife and I had a couple of kids and

12
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:43,520
I had this and I had that and I had bills and I think all the stuff and my wife just

13
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,800
because I didn't have money didn't mean she doesn't want to go on vacation and she wasn't

14
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,760
on Instagram and she wasn't talking to her friends who are going to Disneyland.

15
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,840
Guys, I've been there.

16
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,840
Okay.

17
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:58,040
So my encouragement is that you have to look at it like, okay, first of all, let's not

18
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,040
be stupid.

19
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,960
Let's not go blow money, obviously, but also at the same time, let's just be really good

20
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,200
about where we put our money.

21
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,240
And yes, for the first little bit, it might feel like it's running at a snail's speed,

22
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,240
but guess what?

23
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,280
Once you get that first deal, it opens up a little cash and then instead of taking the

24
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:17,160
cash and just go blowing it on something stupid, let's put it back in the business.

25
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,360
And now maybe we can run too, but we're going to be smart about it.

26
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,920
We're not just going to go burn in cash and boom, we got two deals.

27
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,920
Okay, cool.

28
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,440
Things are starting to go and now maybe we need to get a VA, right?

29
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,160
So I think the thing I would tell you is like, the encouragement is I was there.

30
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,160
I was there in 2019 when I was figuring this out.

31
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,760
I was like, dude, what do I have to work with?

32
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,320
What can I sell?

33
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,400
What can I do?

34
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,560
Which one of my sites that I built in another program is generating some leads that fits

35
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,000
the criteria and has low CPC.

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,280
And yeah, for the first couple of months running this strategy, guys, I was doing them one

37
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,280
at a time.

38
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,960
Literally, it was one at a time until we went and said, let's do 10K in a month.

39
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,560
And then we started doing two or three.

40
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,600
So I think it gets frustrating.

41
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,880
We see everyone else smash the deal, smash the deal, smash the deals.

42
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,880
Trust me, guys.

43
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:11,880
I know that it could get frustrating, but also you got to realize just because it's

44
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:18,000
taking you, whoever you are to get your first, it's taking you longer.

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,640
I heard this quote one time and it gets over quoted, but like, I think it's we overestimate

46
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:29,240
what we can do in a year and we underestimate what we can do in five.

47
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:34,280
And some of you guys are overestimating what you can do in one month or two months or six

48
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,280
months.

49
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,040
Guys, if I would have stopped, I started doing this in 2016.

50
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:44,160
If I would have stopped, if I would have at the year two mark or the year three mark,

51
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,320
if I would have stopped and been like, well, guys, at the end of year three, I had made

52
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:53,440
a couple hundred grand in three years.

53
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,720
And then in literally in eight months, I went to a hundred grand a month and made seven

54
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,840
figures in one freaking year.

55
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,640
We underestimate what we can do or we overestimate what we can do in, you know, one year.

56
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:12,000
And for some of you guys, one month and we underestimate what we can do in five years.

57
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,040
The reason why I'm patient, but I'm still hustling, but I'm patient is because I'm going

58
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,040
to be doing this.

59
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,400
I don't care what recession comes.

60
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,040
I don't care what business opportunity comes.

61
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,840
I don't care who comes across my plate or what partnership comes, but I'm going to be

62
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,840
doing this.

63
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,200
And I promise you, for those of you that are like already shiny object syndrome, looking

64
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,800
at other stuff and, oh, there's this thing over here, you'll be back.

65
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,440
And guess who's still going to be here?

66
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,520
Your boy, the king of digital real estate and the crown is going to be a lot freaking

67
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,120
bigger when you come back.

68
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,120
Okay.

69
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,120
I'm going to be here.

70
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,120
So that's why I don't get upset.

71
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:49,040
I'll get worked up when Google changes the GMB and the recession's coming and it's winter.

72
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,880
It's like, so, so I'm in this man.

73
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,880
Good question though.
