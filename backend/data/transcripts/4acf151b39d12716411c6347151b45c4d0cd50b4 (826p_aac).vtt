right now and let me let them in and then we'll get going right away.

00:11.440 --> 00:20.760
Hold on just a second, all right, guys welcome to the call, welcome Craig just joined, maybe.

00:20.760 --> 00:28.220
I'm not really sure, okay, now he's back, let's see.

00:28.220 --> 00:32.260
Let's see what we got here, there's Craig, all right Craig welcome to the call man, good

00:32.260 --> 00:36.100
to have you on, I've got this thing recording, let's jump right into it, I just want to pull

00:36.100 --> 00:40.900
up a couple notes to make sure I don't miss anything and it's gonna make me sign in, hold

00:40.900 --> 00:47.060
on one second guys, I hope it's not making me do the two-step note, we're good, okay.

00:47.060 --> 00:49.860
Just want to make sure we don't miss anything, I've got a few things I wanted to make sure

00:49.860 --> 00:55.860
just to cover really quick and then let's dive into some Q&A, go over anything you guys

00:55.860 --> 01:02.580
want to talk about, I've got a few things I want to cover and let's start off this

01:02.580 --> 01:08.420
Monday morning, I guess it's 7 a.m. for you guys depending on where you're at, all right,

01:08.420 --> 01:19.640
here we are, okay, as long as you guys can hear me let's get started, so guys, Craig

01:19.640 --> 01:29.780
is here, what am I seeing over here, okay, all right guys, March 3rd, we're two months

01:29.780 --> 01:37.980
into the new year, crazy hot times flying, I would highly encourage you guys if you haven't

01:37.980 --> 01:44.960
made a habit of doing this is take the first Monday of every month, Monday, Tuesday and

01:44.960 --> 01:50.060
look at how your month went, did you hit the goals that you set, your revenue goals,

01:50.060 --> 01:53.480
if you didn't hit your revenue goals, hold on, letting people in, there's Frank back

01:53.480 --> 01:58.920
in the house, okay, if you didn't hit your revenue goals, why, did you not do enough

01:58.920 --> 02:03.400
appointments, did you not do enough Zoom calls, if you didn't do enough Zoom calls, why is

02:03.400 --> 02:08.280
that, did you not get enough business owners on the hook, what I'm going to be doing today

02:08.280 --> 02:14.880
in about an hour after this call finishes is I'm going to be going through, got my

02:14.880 --> 02:20.760
goals in my notebook here and I'll be looking at what, you know, where we actually ended

02:20.760 --> 02:25.840
up for the month versus where our goal was to end up and then just course correct, guys,

02:25.840 --> 02:30.180
it's very simple stuff but it's just like if we were trying to go from, just like the

02:30.180 --> 02:36.360
example I always like to use, if our roadmap, if we started in Washington where Paul's at

02:36.480 --> 02:42.800
and we wanted to get to Miami and Miami would be representative of our goal of $20,000 per

02:42.800 --> 02:50.840
month by July 1st or by December 31st, right, you want to take inventory and find out, okay,

02:50.840 --> 02:57.280
it's two months in and we're all the way over in Idaho when we should be down in, I don't

02:57.280 --> 03:02.720
know, Denver, I don't even know where the path would be but okay, that's fine, you guys,

03:02.720 --> 03:08.240
we can still get to Miami but now we got to take a different direction, we've got to speed

03:08.240 --> 03:12.880
it up, we can't take as many breaks, we've got to, you know, maybe increase the speed

03:12.880 --> 03:18.960
that we were going to go by five miles per hour for the next, you know, two months, whatever,

03:18.960 --> 03:20.640
but guys, you have to be taking inventory.

03:20.640 --> 03:26.080
One thing I did not do last year is I set my goals and I just kind of like, just did

03:26.080 --> 03:27.080
my thing.

03:27.080 --> 03:31.600
I didn't check on them, I didn't, you know, audit where we were at and that was a huge

03:31.600 --> 03:32.600
mistake.

03:32.600 --> 03:35.720
This year so far I've done a really good job and at the end of last month I went and I

03:35.720 --> 03:42.080
just took my notebook, looked at my goals, we had our biggest month of the last 12 months

03:42.080 --> 03:46.520
was January and I was like, what do we do right, what do we do wrong and anyway, just

03:46.520 --> 03:50.600
a simple thing, you guys, just take an hour, look at your goals and by the way, if you

03:50.600 --> 03:54.480
don't even have your goals, go watch the, we have a mini course called Map Your Goals

03:54.480 --> 03:58.240
or I think it's called Map Your Goals, go watch that, set your goals.

03:58.240 --> 04:05.480
You guys, what we use, I think I talk about it in the training, but I use this book, Think

04:05.480 --> 04:10.840
and Grow Rich, one of the sections in here, one of the chapters in here talks about basically

04:10.840 --> 04:15.320
goal setting and we use the framework from this book to set your goals, okay, that's

04:15.320 --> 04:24.320
what I like and I think it's chapter, I think it's chapter, what chapter is it, let me just

04:24.320 --> 04:27.560
tell you guys in case you want to check it out.

04:27.560 --> 04:36.440
I think it is chapter, dang, these chapters are a little bit beefy, hold on, hold on,

04:36.440 --> 04:48.040
I think it's chapter seven, I think it's chapter seven, I could be wrong, but anyway, I'm almost

04:48.040 --> 04:53.320
positive it's chapter seven, maybe somebody can back me up there, but anyway, yes, under

04:53.320 --> 04:57.800
organized planning, I think this is the chapter that you're going to want to use.

04:57.800 --> 05:02.400
Anyway, if you guys haven't set your goals, please do that, please do that, it's going

05:02.400 --> 05:04.600
to be huge for you guys, okay.

05:04.600 --> 05:09.400
Other thing I want to say really quick and then we'll get into Q&A, a couple weeks ago

05:09.400 --> 05:17.960
I shared a link inside of the group, inside of the school community and it was a link

05:17.960 --> 05:23.720
to a book called The Slide Edge, okay, free link, free PDF and I just said to you guys

05:23.720 --> 05:27.480
this book, I think I said this book will change your life and I want you guys to know that

05:27.480 --> 05:31.760
I started this book around, this is my fifth time reading it, fourth or fifth time reading

05:31.760 --> 05:38.000
it, I started this book around the last week of January, I just finished it on Saturday,

05:38.000 --> 05:45.880
okay, I was on the treadmill, finished the last pages, guys, this book, it's such a simple

05:45.880 --> 05:52.520
book, it's such an easy read, but I promise you and it's not an affiliate link, it's

05:52.520 --> 05:55.600
none of that, it will change your life.

05:55.600 --> 06:02.400
If you just read the book 10 pages a day, you read the book, you do the actions, I've

06:02.400 --> 06:07.640
recommended my little, I've recommended everybody in digital landlords to read it, I've personally

06:07.640 --> 06:10.240
asked my little brother Porter to read it, which by the way, I think he's like a fourth

06:10.240 --> 06:15.600
the way through, I bought multiple copies for people, it is a phenomenal book, if you

06:15.600 --> 06:21.640
feel like you're stuck in a rut, if you feel like you can't quite get that momentum, if

06:21.640 --> 06:26.800
you feel like you're just, you're right there on the cusp that you can't get it, go read

06:26.800 --> 06:32.120
this book, okay, slide edge 10 pages a day, it'll freaking change your life and I'm telling

06:32.120 --> 06:37.720
you that again, I have no, I'm not getting paid to say that, whatever, okay, but guys,

06:37.720 --> 06:41.720
what this book's done for me, it's just allowed me, it just helped me to have a number one

06:41.800 --> 06:47.200
realize that it's literally this game is about doing all these little things correctly and

06:47.200 --> 06:52.440
doing them again and again and again and again and when you start doing the little things

06:52.440 --> 06:56.520
in one area, it bleeds to another area and it bleeds to another area and it bleeds to

06:56.520 --> 07:00.440
another area and that's in the negative and in the positive, okay, so let me just give

07:00.440 --> 07:07.400
you an example, last year, something that I was not very good at is I was very lazy

07:07.400 --> 07:11.720
about when I would travel, okay, I would look at the, I would go to book my travel

07:11.720 --> 07:15.400
and I would travel any day of the week, sometimes it was a Monday, sometimes it was a Wednesday,

07:15.400 --> 07:19.520
sometimes it was a Friday, sometimes it was a Sunday and what would happen is sometimes

07:19.520 --> 07:25.360
I would leave Dubai, let's say like on a Monday or a Tuesday, I miss the whole Tuesday, I

07:25.360 --> 07:30.120
get in, I miss the whole Wednesday, I'm jet lagged for Thursday and then I want to spend

07:30.120 --> 07:35.560
time with my kids on Friday, I was missing entire weeks because of just that little decision

07:35.560 --> 07:40.380
of not even thinking about when should I book my flight.

07:40.380 --> 07:45.800
This year, I'm very intentional about, hey, I'm not missing work days, I'll travel on

07:45.800 --> 07:53.080
the weekends and I'll miss my weekends, I'll sacrifice going out on the weekend so I can

07:53.080 --> 07:58.980
travel, I can get to my spot, get set up, get rested and get ready to go.

07:58.980 --> 08:04.900
So I was coming to London, I think I already said that, I came to London and I was trying

08:04.900 --> 08:08.400
to figure out when should I go, when should I go, when should I go and I literally made

08:08.400 --> 08:14.180
the decision to come here on a Friday, like a Friday afternoon so I could work the morning

08:14.180 --> 08:18.640
and then I could work a little bit on the plane and then guys, I got here, the room

08:18.640 --> 08:24.020
wasn't ready of course, it was like 12, I hadn't slept much at all, I was so tired

08:24.020 --> 08:28.180
but basically what I did is on Friday, I planned my day Friday like I was going to run the

08:28.180 --> 08:32.180
whole day and then I said to myself, whatever I miss, whatever I don't get on Friday when

08:32.180 --> 08:36.140
I'm traveling, I'm going to move it to Saturday and I'm going to take care of it and it sounds

08:36.140 --> 08:39.580
like a great idea until it's actually Saturday and you actually have to do it and you actually

08:39.580 --> 08:44.300
have to work and you're tired and your room's not ready but needless to say guys, Saturday

08:44.300 --> 08:50.300
before I took a nap, before I did anything, I got here, I went to a coffee shop, I busted

08:50.300 --> 08:55.260
out a couple hours of work, got some food, finally got checked in the room, did another

08:55.260 --> 08:58.660
30 minutes of work and then I finally let myself sleep, okay.

08:58.660 --> 09:04.020
I woke up before I went out, did anything, I went to the gym, these little teeny, these

09:04.020 --> 09:11.260
little things guys, they are all adding up and it's crazy because they're all contributing

09:11.260 --> 09:19.800
to like I've never, I feel momentum like I haven't in years, okay, again, this all comes

09:19.800 --> 09:25.140
back to one thing, reading 10 pages of The Slide Edge every single day for the month

09:25.180 --> 09:29.900
of February and it's completely transformed my entire business, I feel so much momentum,

09:29.900 --> 09:35.300
I feel excited, I'm pumped, so I want to, I'm giving you guys a gift, there's a PDF,

09:35.300 --> 09:41.100
type in Slide Edge PDF, it's completely free, you guys read 10 pages, they will change your

09:41.100 --> 09:42.100
life, okay.

09:42.100 --> 09:45.140
All right, that's it guys, that's all I want to share, let me turn the AC off, it's blowing

09:45.140 --> 09:49.900
right on me, hold on.

09:49.900 --> 09:54.140
And let's get into it guys, one quick thing, if you guys haven't already, please go and

09:54.140 --> 09:59.380
update the map, I think I showed you guys last week, but let me, if I could just show

09:59.380 --> 10:02.860
you really quick here, got a couple things I just want to show, well, let me go like

10:02.860 --> 10:10.180
this, yeah, let me do this, I want to show you guys, because I think it's, I've said

10:10.180 --> 10:14.180
this before, I'm going to see who's actually in town, where I'm at right now, let me get

10:14.180 --> 10:22.060
my 7,000 windows closed up here, good night, hold on, sorry about that guys, okay, let

10:22.060 --> 10:33.780
me go ahead and share my screen, really quick, go to the community here, all right, okay,

10:33.780 --> 10:51.780
let's go like this, there we go, I think hopefully you guys can see my screen, all right, okay,

10:52.580 --> 10:57.860
can you guys see my screen by the way, can you let me know in the chat, can anybody see

10:57.860 --> 11:02.940
my screen, just can somebody confirm that, I think you can, right, my zoom's been really

11:02.940 --> 11:08.500
weird lately, yes, okay, cool, yeah, so guys, really quick, let me just show you this super

11:08.500 --> 11:14.860
quick, all you got to do is go like this, go to the classroom, come down here, hit community

11:14.860 --> 11:21.980
world map, and then you're going to just click on this link here, and what you'll do is this

11:21.980 --> 11:27.540
little button in the corner, this purple button, you'll click this, okay, and let me move this

11:27.540 --> 11:32.180
really quick, it's going to say right here, add location, you take your ID, your school

11:32.180 --> 11:39.980
ID, so for me, if I go to my thing here, my profile, I have this school ID right here,

11:39.980 --> 11:48.660
I click on this, I go here, my display name, Nicholas Wood, and then my location, I'm going

11:48.660 --> 11:57.700
to be, I'm in London right now, so I'm going to put London, UK, and boom, looks like me,

11:57.700 --> 12:05.980
oh, here we go, I'm in London, and then Mr. Simon Tasker is also in London, okay, so guys,

12:05.980 --> 12:10.340
go do that, it takes two seconds, it's just really cool to see where people are, who's

12:10.340 --> 12:15.300
over here, somebody in Bulgaria, I think I saw that one last time, okay, great, and then

12:15.300 --> 12:19.980
we've got somebody in India, so guys, take two seconds, go and just update this, I know

12:19.980 --> 12:25.460
some of you guys have, but you have to actually go in and hit this button, and add your location,

12:25.460 --> 12:31.700
if you don't do that, it's not going to work, okay, all right, I think that's it, I think

12:31.700 --> 12:36.740
we can get into the good stuff, let me just double check here, okay, okay, yeah, there

12:36.740 --> 12:40.220
is one more thing I want to cover, I think I mentioned this, or I did mention this, I

12:40.220 --> 12:46.580
don't know if I did on this call, but I made a post, guys, I am working on a new, I'm actually,

12:46.580 --> 12:51.300
the truth is, so I've been working on a new course for this community, and then we're

12:51.300 --> 12:56.760
calling it the step-by-step guide to landing your first thousand dollar per month deal,

12:56.760 --> 13:03.760
it's going to be literally breaking it down by week of what tasks you should do, it's

13:03.760 --> 13:10.280
going to be very in-depth, very exact of what you should do to get that first deal, okay,

13:10.280 --> 13:15.120
I'm really excited about it, I put in a lot of hours already, and all that I really have

13:15.120 --> 13:21.160
left to do is the actual filming, so the hard stuff of writing the script of what I want

13:21.160 --> 13:25.880
to put in it, the outline, what kind of resources, what kind of maps do I want to create, what

13:25.880 --> 13:30.080
kind of, you know, all this different stuff, that part's just about done, I actually worked

13:30.080 --> 13:34.160
on it this morning for about an hour, I made a post that said we're going to be dropping

13:34.160 --> 13:39.200
a new course, I thought this was going to be really easy to create, and then I decided

13:39.200 --> 13:44.240
that what I want to do, guys, and what I'm going to do is I'm actually going to, I'm

13:44.240 --> 13:49.280
going to be changing the way that this entire community is consumed in all the content,

13:49.280 --> 13:52.960
because right now we have a bunch of really good content, we have 15 mini courses, we

13:52.960 --> 13:56.880
have so much stuff, and yes, I told you guys to start in the left and go to the right and

13:56.880 --> 14:00.840
go like this, but I need to get even, I think I need to get even more specific of telling

14:00.840 --> 14:06.440
you exactly what I think you should do on week one, day one, week two, week three, week

14:06.440 --> 14:10.640
four, so I'm actually completely reorganizing everything, nothing that's in there's going

14:10.640 --> 14:15.360
to be lost, I'm reorganizing everything in the way that it's consumed, I'm super pumped

14:15.360 --> 14:17.480
about it, but I just want to give you guys an update, I said that was going to be done

14:17.480 --> 14:22.680
in March, it is going to be done in March, but you got to give me probably this weekend,

14:22.680 --> 14:27.520
next week, I'm going to have it, try to have it done by mid-March, this week, I'm in Paris,

14:27.520 --> 14:31.360
I fly to Sierra Leone on Sunday, and then I'll spend the first week in Sierra Leone

14:31.360 --> 14:37.120
filming it and have that thing live, so that is going to literally be live this month,

14:37.120 --> 14:44.240
so if you guys saw that post, that's an update on that, so you guys have an idea, okay?

14:44.240 --> 14:47.080
And then the last thing, I keep saying the last thing, but I just want these little tiny

14:47.080 --> 14:53.480
updates, inside of every time we get done with these lives, these Q&A's, you can go

14:53.480 --> 14:59.320
in like an hour after and we're going to have the replay inside of the replays mini course,

14:59.320 --> 15:03.120
and we actually, I said I was going to do this last time, so we went in, and now what

15:03.120 --> 15:07.720
we'll do is we break down all the different questions that are covered and time stamp

15:07.720 --> 15:12.760
each question, so you can go through and literally just click on the video, fast forward to the

15:12.760 --> 15:16.520
question you want answered, listen to your answer, and go move on and get to work, okay?

15:17.000 --> 15:21.240
All the replays from when we started, I think there's like six, seven weeks worth now, you

15:21.240 --> 15:24.200
guys can go check those out if you missed one, you can go look at the questions that

15:24.200 --> 15:28.400
were covered, boom, scroll to that, and go and consume it really quick, and you guys

15:28.400 --> 15:29.680
are done, okay?

15:29.680 --> 15:37.880
So guys, let's get into it, what questions do you guys have for me on the business, on

15:37.880 --> 15:40.880
anything related?

15:40.880 --> 15:43.600
I'll give you guys an update on my agency here in a second, but let me see what questions

15:43.600 --> 15:46.440
you guys have.

15:46.440 --> 15:51.480
By the way, well, let me go start at the top here, okay, Craig said, goal setting for me

15:51.480 --> 15:57.080
is the easy part, translating into data execution seems to be the gap in moving the needle,

15:57.080 --> 16:06.480
lead lag activities, suggestions in changing that, so Craig, answer this in the comments

16:06.480 --> 16:13.560
for me, is do you not know which daily activities you should execute, or are you just having

16:13.560 --> 16:17.320
a hard time actually doing the thing?

16:17.320 --> 16:21.280
Give me that clarification, we'll keep moving along with that thread, okay?

16:21.280 --> 16:26.700
Okay, Paul says, are the videos you guys were putting together for Rare available yet?

16:26.700 --> 16:32.440
Great question, that's something that Ryan's taken care of, let me message him right now

16:32.440 --> 16:37.560
and ask, I know you asked a question about Rare last time, Paul, and I appreciate it,

16:37.560 --> 16:41.440
and if you didn't get the answer, you should have, you asked me where does the data come

16:41.520 --> 16:47.040
from, for the backlinking, the backlinking data, and it comes directly from Majestic,

16:47.040 --> 16:52.920
which is like a really, really great tool for, the only problem is it only does backlinks,

16:52.920 --> 16:56.800
that's it, but the data comes directly from Majestic, okay?

16:56.800 --> 17:10.520
So let me ask Ryan really quick, I'm just gonna send him a quick text, okay, I will

17:10.600 --> 17:19.280
have an answer for you, Paul, as soon as possible, there's Porter joining right now, okay, Francesco

17:19.280 --> 17:24.320
says, how would you structure a Google Ads account and how would you organize keyword

17:24.320 --> 17:31.320
ad groups, one group for a concrete contractors on or multiple services?

17:31.320 --> 17:39.160
Okay, so I think it was you, Francesco, I think, I'm pretty sure I made a comment on

17:39.160 --> 17:43.480
your post, you asked, I think you asked a part of this question, or maybe it was a bigger

17:43.480 --> 17:49.000
part of this question, so I'm gonna give a little bit of guidance here, but I want you

17:49.000 --> 17:54.680
to understand that I want you to be, I want everybody to be very careful with Google Ads,

17:54.680 --> 17:59.240
okay, you need to understand that yes, Google Ads is a great part of the puzzle, it allows

17:59.240 --> 18:04.360
you to move faster, it allows you to go and put up a one-pager today, run Google Ads,

18:04.360 --> 18:10.280
get the things sped up and hopefully get a deal, at the same time, you have to remember,

18:10.280 --> 18:16.960
I have spent $1.5 million, I have been doing Google Ads since 2020, I have lost a lot of

18:16.960 --> 18:25.420
money and this is not even including the amount of money, guys, in the last year, I've spent

18:25.420 --> 18:32.080
probably close to another 10 grand just on, listen to this, I've spent close to, maybe,

18:32.400 --> 18:38.360
no, it's probably more than that, let's say about 10 grand, just in the last year, because

18:38.360 --> 18:42.080
I was like, you know what, I think we can make our Google Ads training just a little

18:42.080 --> 18:46.280
bit better, I'm talking about Inside Digital Landlords, I went, I found this guy that was

18:46.280 --> 18:51.640
supposed to be really good, highly recommended and said, hey, give me a proposal, I want

18:51.640 --> 18:56.440
to work with you, I want you to show me what you can do, I'm gonna let you run my campaigns,

18:56.440 --> 19:01.120
I'm gonna pay you to run my campaigns and this individual ran my campaigns for months

19:01.120 --> 19:07.040
and, long story short, they weren't really performing any better than what we were already

19:07.040 --> 19:11.520
doing and I was paying a lot more money and it was a lot more difficult to set up and

19:11.520 --> 19:16.760
all this stuff, so I spent $10,000 and all that I learned was that that guy didn't have

19:16.760 --> 19:20.800
anything that I didn't already have, okay, so I'm telling you this because sometimes

19:20.800 --> 19:24.440
we get in, we hear about running ads and we just think we're gonna throw up an ad and

19:24.440 --> 19:28.360
leads are gonna come in, or I'm gonna give you one little answer and it's gonna change,

19:28.360 --> 19:35.160
just understand that you either have to pay the $1.5 million to learn it or you need to

19:35.160 --> 19:40.080
get proper training, which is what we do inside of Digital Landlords for Google Ads and I

19:40.080 --> 19:44.680
want to say that because there's no way I could cover, now, why don't I cover more Google

19:44.680 --> 19:48.640
Ads inside of the RankinRant Academy, well, the reason why is because I don't want this

19:48.640 --> 19:53.700
to turn into a customer service nightmare, okay, once you commit to actually doing this

19:53.700 --> 19:57.740
business for real, for real, for real and you're inside Digital Landlords, I know that

19:57.740 --> 20:00.740
you're gonna do the business, I know that you have to make it work because you've committed

20:00.740 --> 20:05.100
with your money, with your time, you've signed on a piece of paper, hey, I'm gonna do this

20:05.100 --> 20:10.580
and so now let's do it, okay, but for me to come in and teach ads to people that a lot

20:10.580 --> 20:14.460
of you guys or a lot of people inside of our community, a lot of them are just checking

20:14.460 --> 20:18.540
this out, seeing if it's what they want to do, it's literally just gonna turn into a

20:18.540 --> 20:22.180
customer service nightmare, so it's just not economical, it doesn't make any sense for

20:22.220 --> 20:26.980
me to talk at length, okay, but back to your question really, really quick, so how would

20:26.980 --> 20:31.380
you structure a Google Ads account and how would you organize keyword ad groups, one

20:31.380 --> 20:40.940
group for keyword contractors, example, multiple services, so again, I try to keep things really

20:40.940 --> 20:48.100
simple, okay, with our Google Ads, what I try to do just to be very transparent is I

20:48.180 --> 20:54.540
try to like literally set up the most basic ads as possible and start tweaking, start

20:54.540 --> 20:59.100
learning for years, I didn't even run negative keywords, I still don't like do a lot of that

20:59.100 --> 21:04.020
stuff, I know, you know, Jeff is, we have a guy inside digital landlords that is kind

21:04.020 --> 21:08.340
of our, he's our ad specialist, he does office hours, for those of you that are in digital

21:08.340 --> 21:14.340
landlords by the way, Paul and you guys, what we've done is over the last week, we've taken

21:14.340 --> 21:20.340
all the live, the office hours that Jeff's done, and we've kind of organized them into a

21:20.340 --> 21:23.540
folder and we're going to start putting them inside of the training inside digital landlords,

21:23.540 --> 21:27.300
you guys will be able to go and check through those, but you know, some of the things that

21:27.300 --> 21:33.300
he'll say is like, you know, you can set the ads to start running at 7am and stop running

21:33.300 --> 21:38.660
at 7pm, I don't even mess with that stuff, okay, you can, I don't think it's bad, what my only

21:38.660 --> 21:43.540
advice I'm going to give you is to just simplify it, with this specific example,

21:44.820 --> 21:48.900
there's no way that we could go into that and not confuse a bunch of people,

21:48.900 --> 21:53.140
if you want to message me privately, then I can maybe point you in the right direction with some

21:53.140 --> 21:59.780
resources, but we just don't cover a lot of the ad stuff, especially like those nuanced questions,

21:59.780 --> 22:04.260
because there's more, you need more context, there's more to it than just, you know,

22:04.980 --> 22:08.740
what is the budget? Well, and I know that's not what you're asking, but if somebody asks,

22:08.740 --> 22:13.700
what should you set the daily budget at? Well, it really depends, you know, should I let it go

22:13.700 --> 22:19.380
higher than five bucks per cost per click? Well, what are you, what factors are we, what's, what,

22:19.380 --> 22:23.780
you know, what niche are we looking at? What city, what kind of budget, what kind of a deal are you

22:23.780 --> 22:28.340
looking to sign? How much budget are you going to have? You know, how, like there's so many

22:28.340 --> 22:33.140
different factors, so if you want, you can message me privately on school, I'll see what I can

22:33.140 --> 22:36.980
do to, in terms of pointing you in the right direction, but that's the stuff that we cover

22:36.980 --> 22:45.860
more into the more in-depth training, okay? Okay, let's keep going. Craig says, I think I just

22:45.860 --> 22:54.740
answered my question clearly defined why. Okay, he's talking about executing. Sorry,

22:54.740 --> 23:02.740
I'm jumping ahead here. Okay. What's that? Craig, let's go up to Michael says, how do you

23:02.740 --> 23:06.580
overcome the objection of track record or past successes when closing the first deal,

23:06.580 --> 23:11.620
not having an example testimonies? Porter, are you still on this Porter? If you are, dude, hop on.

23:11.620 --> 23:14.580
Let me ask you to unmute. I'm going to help you have you answer this question because this is

23:14.580 --> 23:19.620
something you just barely dealt with. Let me see if Porter's on right now. If Porter is, I'm going

23:19.620 --> 23:23.780
to have him all answered. If not, oh, there he is. Porter, can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you.

23:23.780 --> 23:27.620
Beautiful. I want you to answer this question for Michael, just because this is something

23:27.620 --> 23:32.420
you're currently dealing with, but he says, how do you overcome the objection of track records?

23:32.420 --> 23:37.380
You get on a call with the business owner. It's your first deal. They don't have any other proof,

23:38.260 --> 23:42.580
you don't have any other websites to show anybody of, hey, I did this for so-and-so.

23:43.140 --> 23:49.060
How do you deal with that at the business owners asking you for references or whatever? How did

23:49.060 --> 23:55.620
you get your first deal that way? When I have anything, I honestly was just super transparent.

23:55.620 --> 24:02.100
I wasn't like, you're my first deal, but in a way I was like, I want to build this relationship

24:02.100 --> 24:06.820
off trust. I understand you probably want proof and all this, but I've sent you three or four

24:06.820 --> 24:12.820
leads. You've quoted them. I'm getting the jobs. I want to build this out of trust. If you have any

24:12.820 --> 24:18.900
second thoughts now, then I would rather you tell me, then we get into this some months.

24:18.900 --> 24:23.220
I almost just play that card because, again, I don't want to lie to the guy, but again,

24:23.220 --> 24:28.340
you want to work with someone that's not always questioning you. If he's questioning you, it's

24:28.340 --> 24:33.940
most likely you've maybe done something in the past. You haven't quite earned their trust enough

24:33.940 --> 24:39.300
for them not to, because when I did it right the first time, no one asked me about it, but I've

24:39.300 --> 24:43.540
been asked that when I haven't gained enough trust before the call. Does that make sense?

24:43.540 --> 24:50.420
Yeah, it's true. This is one of the things to remember, Michael, is if you are getting the

24:50.420 --> 24:56.660
same objection again and again and again, it's usually something that at a subconscious level

24:56.660 --> 25:02.420
you have an issue with. For example, people that I always hear are like, how do you get around price?

25:02.420 --> 25:07.940
How do you get around price? Dude, I never get objection of price. I think one of the reasons

25:07.940 --> 25:14.900
why is because to me, if you tell me, hey, it's a thousand bucks a month, that is not to me personally

25:15.940 --> 25:20.660
because I've been in business. I know what stuff costs. I know what it costs to pay for employees,

25:20.660 --> 25:24.660
to pay for an office. A thousand bucks a month is just another bill,

25:25.620 --> 25:30.740
right? But sometimes when we start business and we're used to a $4,000 a month salary

25:31.300 --> 25:36.820
and every hundred dollars counts, and I've been there and we're asking people for a thousand bucks

25:36.820 --> 25:40.180
a month, and you know that if somebody asks you for a thousand bucks a month, it would scare the

25:40.180 --> 25:45.700
crap out of you. What you're doing is you're selling out of your own wallet, and so you're

25:45.700 --> 25:54.660
projecting whatever. I never get price. I never get price objection. I never get contract objection.

25:54.660 --> 25:59.780
Why? Because I've resolved these objections in myself, and I've seen this with sales reps.

25:59.780 --> 26:04.340
I've seen this with people that I've trained in all kinds of different areas. If you are continually

26:04.340 --> 26:07.220
getting that, I don't know if you are, but if Michael, if you're getting this again and again,

26:07.780 --> 26:16.420
you have to realize that you're probably somebody, I'm guessing, that has to see a track record or

26:16.420 --> 26:20.100
whatever, but I like what Porter said, and I think it's really true, is you just be transparent. You

26:20.100 --> 26:24.180
probably don't go in like Porter's saying and be like, yeah, this is my very first client ever.

26:24.180 --> 26:29.140
Congratulations. However, I think it's fine to just be very transparent and be like, hey,

26:29.140 --> 26:35.060
I'm actually pretty new to this, but look, I've already sent you three leads. The proof's in the

26:35.060 --> 26:39.540
pudding, and I'd love to earn your business, and you can even frame it like you're giving them a

26:39.540 --> 26:43.380
bit of a deal as long as they give a testimony like, hey, I'm normally going to charge $1,500

26:43.380 --> 26:47.460
for this. I'm only going to charge you $1,000 if you'll give me a testimony once this is said

26:47.460 --> 26:54.340
and done. That's one way. Another thing that you can do is you can borrow off of other people's

26:54.340 --> 27:00.740
success. I'm more than happy if you guys want to use one of my websites, like Bentonville Concrete,

27:00.740 --> 27:06.660
and show them, hey, this is one of our partner sites, blah, blah, blah. Can you come back in

27:06.660 --> 27:14.340
20 minutes? Hold on. Porter, keep going. Yeah. No, and that's a good point. For my first deal,

27:14.340 --> 27:20.660
I actually used Bentonville Concrete as a site that would say, hey, this is the goal. Obviously,

27:20.660 --> 27:24.580
I don't have one that I've ranked organically myself because I'm pre-sold by pre-selling,

27:24.580 --> 27:30.340
but I have used Bentonville Arkansas to close my first deal. Again, if they're wanting like, hey,

27:30.340 --> 27:36.020
do you have other reviews of a website for your company? It's like, no, I don't have a website.

27:36.740 --> 27:40.580
I don't have any other clients. You're my first client, but you don't say that. Yeah,

27:40.580 --> 27:45.700
I think it's totally chill. Up until just recently, I started using my own sites,

27:45.700 --> 27:48.500
but I was using Bentonville Arkansas for my first five deals.

27:49.460 --> 27:53.780
It's not a big deal if you guys want to do that. Guys, when I first started knocking doors,

27:53.780 --> 27:56.580
you know what they trained me on? They said the same thing. They're like, well,

27:56.580 --> 27:59.860
when you knock on the door, you want to name drop a couple of people you've started working,

27:59.860 --> 28:03.460
you've done deals for, and I'm like, well, this is my first deal. They're like, well,

28:04.820 --> 28:10.260
I just closed this lady named Susie, and there's this other guy named Danny, so you're going to

28:10.260 --> 28:14.820
use those names, and they gave me their last names, whatever. So I'd knock on the door,

28:14.820 --> 28:21.140
keep in mind I'm in Arkansas, and I'm like, hey, you happen to know Lucy down the street,

28:21.140 --> 28:25.540
or I can't remember if it was, anyway. I'm like, do you know so-and-so? I've used the full name,

28:25.540 --> 28:30.820
Lucy Smith. Oh, you don't know Lucy? Meanwhile, she's in Utah, right? They're customers,

28:30.820 --> 28:33.940
but I'm like, yeah, we just set them up, which we did. They're just in Utah.

28:35.620 --> 28:41.300
We kind of just leveraged that confidence. Anyway, you could do it any way you want to do.

28:41.300 --> 28:48.100
You don't have to be shady or anything like that, but just be transparent. It's the same

28:48.100 --> 28:52.580
thing when people always ask me, what do you do when the business owner asks you

28:53.860 --> 28:59.940
how you're getting the leads? I'm like, you tell them? You tell them. What do you mean?

28:59.940 --> 29:04.420
Well, you want to show them the website? Yeah. What if they ask you if you're running ads?

29:04.420 --> 29:09.060
Yeah. What's there to hide? Yeah, I'm running ads, dude. I'm getting you leads. You got a

29:09.060 --> 29:14.180
problem with that? It doesn't matter. Same thing, but it's a bit nerve-racking when you

29:14.180 --> 29:21.140
don't have your first deal. Just use Bentonville Concrete. Use any of my websites. Be transparent

29:21.140 --> 29:26.180
with them. Again, coming back to what Porter said, if you give leads up front, that's going

29:26.180 --> 29:30.900
to overcome most of the objections. That's going to help eliminate the biggest objection,

29:30.900 --> 29:34.820
which is the trust issue. That's what you're dealing with is the person doesn't totally

29:34.820 --> 29:39.860
trust you yet because they're asking for reviews. I would say to them, Mr. Business

29:39.860 --> 29:45.540
Owner, what do you need to see? My leads is my credentials. You're getting leads. What

29:45.540 --> 29:50.980
else do you need to know? You know what I'm saying? Usually they don't care. Even if you

29:50.980 --> 29:54.660
ranked organically and you're getting them leads and they're not making money, they're going to

29:54.660 --> 29:59.620
stop working with you regardless. Or you could be paying for Google Ads and be sending them the

29:59.620 --> 30:04.260
same leads and they could be making money on them. They don't care where they're coming from. As

30:04.260 --> 30:08.660
long as they're making money, they're not going to ask questions. Very true. Very true.

30:11.060 --> 30:14.260
Let's see. This is a good question here. I want to address it.

30:15.460 --> 30:19.460
Craig was talking about, he's like goal setting is the easy part. Then he's like,

30:19.460 --> 30:25.460
how do you translate it into daily execution? I asked him, I said, is your problem with

30:26.340 --> 30:31.540
figuring out what to do or actually executing on it? He said that he answered his own question.

30:31.620 --> 30:35.300
He said executing. Then a little bit later, he said, I think I just answered my own question,

30:35.300 --> 30:43.220
clearly defining why. Porter, let me ask you about this. You've been doing this about two years.

30:44.660 --> 30:48.340
You've probably had times where, because you've set your goals, you know exactly what you need

30:48.340 --> 30:53.140
to do. This week, I need to hook two business owners, whatever. Let's say that's your activities.

30:54.420 --> 31:01.460
How have you been able to get more consistent with actually executing on the things

31:01.460 --> 31:05.700
that you need to do? What would you say your advice is? Because I know that there's been

31:05.700 --> 31:09.940
times when you've kind of sloughed off or gotten distracted. Then recently, this year,

31:11.540 --> 31:16.180
if you guys weren't inside of digital landlords, me and Porter, was it last week? I think so. Maybe

31:16.180 --> 31:21.300
last week we talked about replacing business owners. Porter actually lost two business

31:21.300 --> 31:29.860
owners in the same day and replaced them the same day. Then he also hooked somebody else. Then

31:29.860 --> 31:36.420
he had them on trial. Porter gets a lot more nos than he talks about. He's got somebody else

31:36.420 --> 31:43.220
on trial. Anyway, how have you been able to stay consistent with executing the actual activities?

31:43.860 --> 31:48.660
Hey, I need to hook a business owner every week. In order to do that, I need to call

31:49.780 --> 31:54.020
five business owners. Not call, but talk to five business owners. How do you get yourself to

31:54.020 --> 31:57.780
consistently do that? It's easy to put it down. It's hard to actually do. What are some tips?

31:58.180 --> 32:04.500
I think the first thing is to share your goals with somebody else, whether it's the group or

32:04.500 --> 32:09.060
someone that you feel like is actually going to hold you accountable. I think as soon as I told

32:09.060 --> 32:16.100
people within the group that I was making 10K, the last thing I want to do is to either get on a call

32:16.100 --> 32:22.580
and not be at 10K when we're talking about making money at 10K. My standard was, oh, I'm just kind

32:22.980 --> 32:30.660
of below 10K to now. I've hit the 10K and my pride is I don't want to get below that. It's crazy

32:30.660 --> 32:36.100
what your mind and what you can accomplish when you are like, hey, I'm just not dropping below

32:36.100 --> 32:41.540
this. Me and Nick talked about this before, but it's like a thermostat. As soon as the temperature

32:41.540 --> 32:47.780
drops below a certain point, the AC unit or the heater kicks on and then it gets to a certain

32:47.780 --> 32:53.620
point. Then we get comfortable and then it kicks off. I think that was my biggest thing is I'm

32:53.620 --> 32:58.260
still trying to figure this out, but I want to consistently be going this way and not just feel

32:58.260 --> 33:04.740
like this comfort. I just think for me, it's like share your goals with people and set your

33:04.740 --> 33:11.380
standards of this is just who I am. This is what I do because I think that's the hardest thing is

33:11.380 --> 33:17.540
I was doing this consistently, but was I actually bought into it? Was I actually doing it to make

33:17.540 --> 33:21.140
money or was I doing it to say, hey, I was just doing this business model every day? I wasn't

33:21.140 --> 33:29.540
really moving the needle. Like last week, I had this guy that I had hooked that Nick was talking

33:29.540 --> 33:35.220
about. Basically, we didn't make it to the call and I immediately got back on the phone and I

33:35.220 --> 33:39.700
called someone and I have a Zoom call scheduled for Saturday, which they had to push it today,

33:39.700 --> 33:45.700
so I rescheduled it. It's at 430 today. Before that, I felt like it would have really discouraged

33:45.700 --> 33:50.100
me because I would have lost that deal technically, but then it's like I could

33:50.100 --> 33:53.460
have waited a week to call somebody else, but you just get back on the phone and you're like,

33:54.420 --> 33:59.220
I want to get past that 10K. I don't want to be just barely over 10K. That's just my standard now.

34:00.180 --> 34:04.020
That's probably the best way that I can explain it now. I'm still working on it. I'm not perfect,

34:04.020 --> 34:06.340
but that's just kind of what has really driven me recently.

34:07.300 --> 34:10.500
Good. Yeah. I mean, at the end of the day,

34:14.020 --> 34:20.340
it's like, and I think you answered your own question. He said clearly defining his why.

34:21.140 --> 34:31.700
It's like when I wake up tired and not excited about stuff, I'll be honest, this morning I woke

34:31.700 --> 34:38.340
up. I'm still a little jet lagged. I don't know why, but I woke up and I woke up at 630.

34:38.340 --> 34:45.940
I did my regular stuff. The first hour, I wasn't jacked about sitting down,

34:47.300 --> 34:55.380
planning out all my employees' to-do lists, and then planning my team meeting.

34:56.180 --> 35:02.180
I have the same Monday pretty much every single Monday. I wasn't super thrilled about it,

35:02.180 --> 35:08.660
and I didn't feel that great either, just for the record. But I know, and I remember thinking

35:10.420 --> 35:15.700
there are certain things that I want to do this year that's going to require a certain amount

35:15.700 --> 35:19.380
of capital. There's been some investments that I really, really want to make that's going to put

35:19.380 --> 35:29.060
me in a position to be very, very set in terms of passive income. And in order for me to be part

35:29.060 --> 35:35.860
of these projects, I'm going to need to bring a lot of money to the table. Because I know exactly

35:35.860 --> 35:38.900
what I want to do, where I'm going to put that money, how much money I need to bring in,

35:39.540 --> 35:44.740
when I start getting tired, I'm like, dude, Nick, just pull out of it for a second, go walk around

35:44.740 --> 35:50.100
the block, whatever, do some press ups, drink some water, get back to it. It's all going to

35:50.100 --> 35:55.860
be worth it in the end. So yes, defining your why and exactly why you're doing this. And then

35:56.980 --> 36:01.460
also just think about the alternative. If that doesn't inspire you, if you don't have a why that

36:01.460 --> 36:05.060
inspires you, think about the alternative. Think about what life is going to look like if you keep

36:05.060 --> 36:10.660
on the same path that you're on right now. Just like, let's say we even were Porter's at. Porter's

36:10.660 --> 36:15.940
making 10K a month. That's great. He's in a much better position than he was making $0 per month

36:15.940 --> 36:23.940
and just making money from his full-time thing. But if he stays the same, he's going to just be

36:23.940 --> 36:31.540
at 10K per month in five years. That's not exciting. That's terrible. So I always think about,

36:32.180 --> 36:36.660
if you know exactly what you want, why you want it, but then also just look at what's the

36:36.660 --> 36:41.940
alternative. For me, I'm so terrified of waking up and realizing I just wasted it.

36:42.980 --> 36:49.540
And not only I just wasted it, but I was just another average freaking dude that's like,

36:49.540 --> 36:56.660
yeah, he was a good guy and he was a hard worker. And it's like, so? Everybody's a good guy and a

36:56.660 --> 37:02.820
hard worker. I want to be somebody that actually did something huge and did something that changed

37:02.820 --> 37:09.780
a lot of lives. And I'm so terrified of just blending into everybody else. And so these things

37:09.780 --> 37:15.140
drive me. And sometimes I'm using negative things to drive me. Sometimes it's positive things. But

37:17.540 --> 37:20.340
I guess the quote is, I don't know the exact quote, but

37:22.180 --> 37:26.900
you do what needs to be done when it needs to be done, regardless of how you feel. That's it.

37:27.620 --> 37:30.820
You map it out. You set the goal. You map it out. And then you do

37:32.500 --> 37:37.140
what has to be done that day. And guys, you're most of the time not going to feel like doing it.

37:37.140 --> 37:41.060
That's just the truth. When I got here on Saturday, I think I was sharing this at the beginning,

37:41.060 --> 37:44.580
Porter, you missed it. But when I got here on Saturday, I had things that I missed on Friday

37:44.580 --> 37:49.460
because I was traveling. And I told myself, if I'm going to miss those things, it's about three

37:49.460 --> 37:52.500
hours worth of work. I'm either doing it on the plane or I'm doing it when I get to the hotel

37:52.500 --> 37:58.740
before I do anything. And I was so tired. I had not slept crap. I got like 30 minutes to an hour

37:58.740 --> 38:03.380
done on the plane, got here before I slept because the room wasn't that I cranked out the work.

38:04.020 --> 38:10.820
And I wasn't inspired by it. I was tired. I was just like some of it. I was quite honestly

38:10.820 --> 38:15.620
going through the motions, but I had to get certain things done. And every part of me wanted to,

38:15.620 --> 38:18.980
I'll just do it on Monday. I'll push it till next week. I'm like, no, I've committed to doing this.

38:19.060 --> 38:23.380
And then I woke up from my nap and I'm like, Hey, I got to go to the gym. And I didn't want to go to

38:23.380 --> 38:28.820
the gym because I was supposed to go out at, you know, meet my friend at a certain time for this

38:28.820 --> 38:33.060
event. But I'm like, dude, I've already committed to doing it. I've got certain fitness goals that

38:33.060 --> 38:37.860
I've got to hit. And that's it. So get clear about your wild, think about the alternative,

38:37.860 --> 38:43.540
and then just do it. It's just a habit of doing it, even if you don't feel like doing it, I think.

38:44.500 --> 38:48.980
And it's, and it's also comes down to like, when you say you're going to do something like the night

38:48.980 --> 38:52.820
before, it's like, you're so motivated to do something. And then the next day, it's like,

38:52.820 --> 38:57.540
you don't feel like it. But if you keep telling, like, if you don't, if, like, if you don't do what

38:57.540 --> 39:01.940
you tell yourself, you're going to do it. Like your confidence just goes down. It's so easier to like,

39:01.940 --> 39:05.540
say, Oh, I didn't do that. Like, I'm not going to do that either. Or like, I'm not going to eat

39:05.540 --> 39:08.340
better. Or like, I'm not going to work out. Like, if I didn't work out, I'm not going to eat good.

39:08.340 --> 39:10.740
You know what I'm saying? It's like, every time that you tell yourself you're going to do something,

39:10.900 --> 39:15.620
don't do it. It's like, you're shooting yourself in the foot. Like, you got to fall through with

39:15.620 --> 39:18.820
what you're going to say you're going to do. And when you do that, it's like a domino effect.

39:18.820 --> 39:21.860
It's like, you just want to keep checking things off your list and you feel really good about

39:21.860 --> 39:25.940
yourself. These guys got, I told these guys at the beginning, they got out of read the slide edge,

39:25.940 --> 39:31.620
dude. Dude, it's crazy guys. What, what, what, what, how, how far in are you?

39:32.980 --> 39:38.340
I, I passed the part where, uh, the, the penny and the, the million dollars.

39:38.420 --> 39:46.580
So are you, what percentage are you? Uh, 20, 25%. Nice. Phenomenal book guys. Um, I told you,

39:46.580 --> 39:52.260
you can go type in slide edge PDF. You can get it for free at that. You could also go pay seven

39:52.260 --> 39:58.580
bucks on Kindle or you could buy the, the, uh, the soft copy. I have all, I've read the book five

39:58.580 --> 40:05.460
times. Um, it's a very simple book, but basically it just talks about this doing simple stuff.

40:05.460 --> 40:08.500
And I'm telling you guys, and I said this before I even read this book this year,

40:08.500 --> 40:15.060
I'd read the book in the past. My, my theme of 20, 25 is simplify and eliminate, right?

40:15.780 --> 40:21.380
Get simple, eliminate the crap that doesn't matter. Okay. Get rid of all the extra fluff

40:21.380 --> 40:26.820
and the meetings and the, this, that, and the rest and just focus on my core business

40:27.380 --> 40:32.260
and growing it and being very simple and just doing it again and again and being really good at

40:32.260 --> 40:36.500
it. And then I started reading this book and it just talks about, again, simplicity,

40:37.060 --> 40:42.820
doing the little simple things every single day. And I promise you, they add up. So guys,

40:42.820 --> 40:46.980
just one more plug, go check out this book. It's not my, not my, not my, I'm not getting

40:46.980 --> 40:52.180
the commission on it, but it's a great book. Okay. Kevin Williams says business owner misses

40:52.180 --> 40:57.540
the zoom call. What do you do? Porter, you've had this happen. Yeah, that's, that's a hard

40:57.540 --> 41:00.900
conversation, especially when you think that they're solid. I mean, I would just message them,

41:00.900 --> 41:05.700
say, Hey, Mr. Business owner. Like I, I see that you missed our call at such and such time. Like,

41:06.500 --> 41:09.940
you know, I was really looking forward to chatting with you, but it seems like you're either,

41:09.940 --> 41:13.700
you know, have enough work or maybe something came up. Like, please let me know so that we

41:13.700 --> 41:17.780
can either reschedule or, you know, I just don't want to waste your time. So I think giving them

41:17.780 --> 41:22.180
a little pullback, I mean, stuff does happen, like stuff emergencies do happen, but like very

41:22.180 --> 41:26.420
rarely does it actually happen. Sometimes it's just, they're just blowing smoke, but you try to

41:26.420 --> 41:30.580
give them the benefit of the doubt. Maybe they just need more time to think about it. But that's

41:30.580 --> 41:34.980
what I like. This, this guy, he literally missed my zoom call and he was like, I'm out on the job

41:34.980 --> 41:39.220
and I was like, well, dude, I got, I'm partnered with someone today because I did have another,

41:39.220 --> 41:42.980
like I didn't have them scheduled, but I was like, I got to schedule with someone. I'd rather sit,

41:42.980 --> 41:47.860
tell you, have you tell me no than for me to just be, you know, just waiting on the zoom call day.

41:47.860 --> 41:52.580
So I sent him a message and then he basically fired back and was like, Hey, I watched your video.

41:52.580 --> 41:57.220
Like, I only want to do a paper lead model and whatever. So I was like, you know what? It's,

41:57.220 --> 42:01.140
it's totally fine. Like, thanks for the conversation. We'll, we'll, we'll revisit this

42:01.140 --> 42:06.020
later. So anyways, left it to that hook somebody else. But that's what I would say. Just have a,

42:06.020 --> 42:10.820
have a conversation with them. I always try not to come out guns a blaze in the first text,

42:10.820 --> 42:14.100
but like at the same time, you got to lay it across like, Hey, I'm looking to partner with

42:14.100 --> 42:18.020
someone, whoever I partner with first, I'm going to go with. So if you want this, like let's

42:18.020 --> 42:26.180
reschedule this for later today or, you know, really soon. Yeah. I think too guys, you need to

42:27.540 --> 42:32.980
what's, what, how do I say this? Whatever you tolerate is what, what people will do to you,

42:32.980 --> 42:38.100
right? It's, it's what you're going to receive. If I've sent you three leads

42:39.620 --> 42:46.100
and I know you've quoted them, right. And you don't get on that call, dude, I'm, I'm pissed

42:46.100 --> 42:49.780
and I'm not, I'm going to be a little more tactful than maybe what I'm saying right now, but

42:49.780 --> 42:54.980
I'm, I'm not going to be super happy. I do this too. Like I've, like this happened about a week

42:54.980 --> 42:58.420
and a half ago. This happens when with business owners happens with people that try to buy our

42:58.420 --> 43:06.020
program. I think this, this was, I think again, about 10 days ago, we had this guy that whatever

43:06.020 --> 43:12.340
he, he applied and then he traveled and whatever. And I, I told him, I said, I'm going to be on the

43:12.340 --> 43:18.580
call just to say, hi, I want to meet you. And I literally had like planned my day. There was like

43:18.580 --> 43:23.300
three, four calls that day that we had to do, but I shifted my calendar so I could be on the call.

43:23.300 --> 43:28.740
And the guy, my team was like, yeah, he canceled. And I was like, give me this guy's number.

43:28.740 --> 43:34.660
And I text him and I was like, Hey, this is Nick. I said, you missed the meeting. I don't, I'm not

43:34.660 --> 43:37.860
sure why. And he's like, yeah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Gave me some reason. I said, look,

43:37.860 --> 43:44.260
I said, I've, I literally, I moved my day around to be on this call. I said, the least you could

43:44.260 --> 43:49.460
have done is like jumped on the call and give me an explanation, right? No pressure, but like,

43:49.540 --> 43:53.300
that's not cool. That's how you do business. And the guy's like, yeah, you're right. Blah, blah,

43:53.300 --> 43:59.300
blah. I just don't tolerate that. And so if somebody misses a meeting, it's, it's usually

43:59.300 --> 44:02.740
indicative of how they're going to do business in the future. I'm not super interested in working

44:02.740 --> 44:06.660
with people that can't get on a meeting. So, and I'll tell them that like, Hey, I've got other

44:06.660 --> 44:11.700
people to work with. You're, your, your money spends the same money as freaking Susan's down

44:11.700 --> 44:17.380
the street. And I'm like, I'm moving on. And guys, if you've sent them three leads, that's

44:17.380 --> 44:20.020
going to sting a little bit. They're going to be like, Oh, I'm super sorry. Let me hop on.

44:20.580 --> 44:24.100
Remember they need us more than we need them. Okay. Don't forget that.

44:26.660 --> 44:32.820
Okay. Paul says, fake it till you make it. He says, kidding using the community sites

44:33.540 --> 44:39.860
is legit. Oops. Being that you are using the same tactics and part of a network. He's talking about

44:39.860 --> 44:44.900
using other people's sites. It's kind of for that first deal, by the way, if you are in digital

44:44.900 --> 44:49.860
landlords, we have a thread in there. If you search for it with a bunch of people that have

44:49.860 --> 44:55.220
listed their website and the name of the business owner and the deals, the deal size where you can

44:55.220 --> 44:59.380
name drop some of these first deals to get your first day, you can name drop some of these other

44:59.380 --> 45:03.860
deals. Okay. And that's true. That's part of the community that we should be leveraging. Okay.

45:04.980 --> 45:07.940
Michael says, makes sense. That's, it's coming from my own personal issues of the consumer

45:07.940 --> 45:16.100
needing proof, talking about his objection that he's getting about what needing, needing a reference

45:16.100 --> 45:20.180
or seeing case studies or whatever. If you're sending leads, they shouldn't need it. That's the

45:20.180 --> 45:28.740
fact. It's Kevin, the solid advice. Okay. Titus says, how can I find a business owner's name in

45:28.740 --> 45:37.620
public records? The internet's wild guys. There's so many ways. If you just do some digging,

45:37.620 --> 45:42.740
I will tell you that like we give specific strategies and techniques. I'm not sure if

45:42.740 --> 45:47.220
Titus is inside digital lands. If you're in digital landlords and you go into module two, building

45:47.220 --> 45:53.300
your list, we walk you through exact tactics. Okay. But if you're not, then some things that

45:53.300 --> 46:02.500
I would recommend is here's a little hack. Go to Google, the Google listing or the Facebook listing

46:03.060 --> 46:07.940
and look at the reviews and start reading through the reviews. A lot of times in the reviews,

46:07.940 --> 46:12.660
these small businesses, the business owner's name will be mentioned in the reviews, right?

46:12.660 --> 46:18.740
The person will be like, we had a phenomenal time with Carlos was really great. He was really

46:18.740 --> 46:24.260
professional. And then the next one's like, awesome job. Had a good exchange with Carlos. I see Carlos

46:24.260 --> 46:28.420
like three, four times, right? So then I start going, okay, Carlos. So I type in the business

46:28.420 --> 46:33.220
owner's name plus Carlos. And all of a sudden, there pops his name. Now I got his name. Then

46:33.220 --> 46:36.820
I'm into Facebook. I'm looking at what he's into, blah, blah, blah. And I'm down the wormhole.

46:36.820 --> 46:41.620
That's just one way of finding the business owner's name. But guys, there's so many tools out there.

46:41.620 --> 46:50.980
You have freaking, I mean, with AI, unbelievable. By the way, I just barely got done. My buddy works

46:50.980 --> 46:55.060
at Google. He's on one of the, he's on the AI, one of the AI teams at Google here in London.

46:55.700 --> 47:03.940
And the kind of money that Google is putting into AI right now is mind-bending. It is freaking

47:03.940 --> 47:11.380
mind-bending because ChatGPT is posing a real threat to Google's main product, which is Google

47:11.380 --> 47:14.980
Ads. I don't know if you guys knew this, but Google Ads, and I literally just confirmed this

47:14.980 --> 47:20.900
with him. He's like, their main revenue stream is Google Ads, okay? So anything that's a threat to

47:20.900 --> 47:26.100
Google Ads, they're going to try and protect. And so ChatGPT, where people are going in and asking

47:26.100 --> 47:31.140
ChatGPT questions, it's pulling away from people searching in Google. So that's why they came out

47:31.140 --> 47:38.660
with Gemini. Anyway, they're putting in a ridiculous amount of money into AI. Go and use these tools,

47:38.660 --> 47:43.860
these AI tools. And I bet you, you're going to be able to find business owner's names really easy.

47:43.860 --> 47:52.260
Okay. Just a little tip there. Okay. Paul says Botzel is a great scraping software that takes

47:52.260 --> 47:55.940
all the business owners in the area and puts them in a spreadsheet. It leverages GMBs. That's great.

47:55.940 --> 48:00.740
Great little, I didn't know, I've never heard of that tool. Sounds awesome. Tidus said,

48:00.740 --> 48:05.540
awesome. Appreciate it guys. Beautiful. Porter, your deal's at 430 today.

48:06.660 --> 48:08.180
Yep. Got one at 430.

48:09.860 --> 48:10.820
How much are you pitching it for?

48:11.780 --> 48:17.460
I'm pitching it for 1500. This is going to be a different call. The owner is actually a woman,

48:17.460 --> 48:23.940
which isn't a bad thing. I've just never quoted or pitched a woman yet as a fencing business owner.

48:23.940 --> 48:31.140
It's a different sell. It's a softer sell. I will say you need to make sure your objections

48:31.140 --> 48:35.940
are overcome upfront. Because as soon as you get to objection overcoming and you start trying to

48:35.940 --> 48:41.780
do your techniques, your tie-downs and stuff, they're very quickly like, no, I don't want to

48:41.780 --> 48:49.060
do it. Just as in door-to-door sales, whatever. I will tell you, we've worked with business

48:49.060 --> 48:54.340
owners in the past that are women. We have one right now that's a client that is a woman. Great

48:54.340 --> 48:57.860
business. Been working with them. I think they're in Colorado. I think I snuck one in the springs,

48:58.500 --> 49:02.660
but not going to tell you about it. My hometown, dude.

49:06.020 --> 49:22.100
Porter gets this deal. That's going to put Porter at $1,200 per month. For those of you that are

49:22.100 --> 49:26.580
just starting, Porter, two and a half years ago, Porter didn't know how to run Google ads. He

49:26.580 --> 49:31.780
didn't know how to build a website. He didn't know anything about SEO. He didn't even know how

49:31.780 --> 49:37.300
to get on Zoom, nor did I. Literally. Yeah. Actually, we're still having problems with Zoom.

49:40.740 --> 49:44.740
If you're struggling getting your first deal, you're over-complicating the process.

49:46.820 --> 49:49.460
Literally just the other day, Porter, when he was telling me about this deal,

49:50.500 --> 49:56.500
I asked him, I said, hey, is this somebody that got an existing website? Is this whatever he's

49:56.820 --> 49:59.940
pre-selling? He's like, I'm just following the training. I'm like, yeah, go figure.

50:03.300 --> 50:07.060
You get your first deal sometimes, guys, and you just think you're smarter than the process. The

50:07.060 --> 50:12.180
process is the process for a reason. The process works. I use this example in the training.

50:12.900 --> 50:19.300
It's like a perfect recipe for baking a cake. Sometimes we build a cake or we bake a cake,

50:19.300 --> 50:26.420
aka we get a deal, and we think, hey, instead of adding the flour here, I'm going to wait until

50:26.420 --> 50:31.620
it's mixed, and then after the milk, I'm going to put the flour in. You forget that there's a reason

50:31.620 --> 50:36.500
why you put the flour in before you do the milk or whatever the case is. There's a reason why

50:36.500 --> 50:41.780
I made the recipe exactly like I made the recipe is because it freaking works. If you don't think

50:41.780 --> 50:46.820
I've tried putting in the chocolate chips at the beginning, then you're crazy because I've tried

50:46.820 --> 50:50.900
all the different combinations, and I'm constantly trying to figure out, hey,

50:50.900 --> 50:55.460
how can we make the same cake in a shorter period of time? How can we make the same cake

50:55.460 --> 51:01.620
with cheaper ingredients? That's why I spent 10,000 bucks on Google Ads from a guy who it

51:01.620 --> 51:07.220
didn't even work. It didn't even help me, but I had to know, hey, can we improve in this area?

51:07.220 --> 51:11.780
Didn't work, spent 10 grand, but that's the value you guys get from being inside the community.

51:12.100 --> 51:19.220
So anyway, Porter, by the way, we also are pitching a deal today. I'm not doing it.

51:19.220 --> 51:25.540
Francesca's doing it. It's not going to be huge. I think it's going to be probably between 500

51:25.540 --> 51:32.420
and 1,000 bucks a month for excavation. I'm not sure I would recommend the niche. We had a referral.

51:32.420 --> 51:38.660
We built it a few years ago, and the guy only had one piece of equipment, and I don't remember

51:38.740 --> 51:43.060
exactly how we lost. We ended up only keeping it for three to six months. Websites have been

51:43.060 --> 51:47.300
sitting there. It's pumping out a few leads. So me and Francesca were getting scrappy. We were like,

51:47.300 --> 51:51.540
dude, we've got to sell some of these websites that are not making money. So we started doing

51:51.540 --> 51:56.340
some Facebook little techniques, and sure enough, dude, we already sent a lead over on the weekend,

51:56.340 --> 52:00.340
guys coming in to meet with Francesca in person, and then she's going to send a screencast. So

52:00.340 --> 52:09.460
we're going for an excavation deal, and then we're going for another deal that I can't tell

52:09.460 --> 52:13.540
you guys the niche because I want to make sure it works, but it could be a very lucrative niche

52:13.540 --> 52:19.140
that you guys have not thought of. So that's the plan. And by the way, I'm not doing any of these

52:19.140 --> 52:23.940
deals myself. This is just me advising Francesca. So hopefully we snag at least one of these deals

52:23.940 --> 52:32.900
this week. So anyway, I can't remember who said they were in. Was it Francesca who said he's in

52:33.940 --> 52:39.060
UK? Let me double check. Francesca, if you're the one that's in the UK, dude, hit me up. I'm here for

52:39.060 --> 52:42.820
another day or two. Let me just see if I can find that. I think it was him.

52:45.780 --> 52:50.740
Yeah, he's in the UK. Beautiful. Yeah, shoot me a message on school. We'll talk about Google Ads.

52:50.740 --> 52:56.740
I'm here. Maybe if I have time, we can meet up for coffee or something. But I am in London for

52:56.740 --> 53:01.860
the next day and a half and I'm going to Paris. So anyway, guys, one last thing real quick.

53:01.860 --> 53:08.660
Starting next week, I'm going to be doing these Q&As slightly different. I'm either going to have

53:08.660 --> 53:14.580
a theme, a Q&A theme. So I'll say, hey, this is all sales Q&A, or I'm going to do a little bit of a

53:14.580 --> 53:21.380
training with a specific topic for the first half and then we can ask questions going off of that.

53:21.380 --> 53:26.420
OK, so you can come with any questions that you want, but I'm going to try to send out a reminder

53:26.420 --> 53:33.540
email Sunday night to remind you guys that, hey, Monday morning, we're going to be doing the live

53:33.540 --> 53:37.220
get on it. And this is the topic that we're going to be training on. Then you guys can jump on and

53:37.220 --> 53:42.500
we can go over that specific topic. So anyway, guys, that said, happy Monday, happy March. Go

53:42.500 --> 53:46.900
over your goals. Review what happened in February. If you fell short, make your course corrections.

53:48.020 --> 53:52.900
And we got one more month and quarter one is done. And then we got three quarters left in the game,

53:52.900 --> 53:57.380
baby. That's it. So anyway, thanks for jumping on Porter. See you guys. Yep. We'll see you guys.
