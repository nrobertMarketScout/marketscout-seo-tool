Curtis Horn, by the way, thanks for your question, bro.

00:02.240 --> 00:05.160
He said, I have tried concrete, now trying spray foam.

00:05.160 --> 00:08.880
I'd like to give a couple of others niches to try as well.

00:08.880 --> 00:11.760
Are masonry and artificial grass good candidates?

00:13.160 --> 00:15.600
So here's the deal, you know, masonry,

00:15.600 --> 00:17.240
I've made a decent amount of money in masonry,

00:17.240 --> 00:19.440
so I would say yes, artificial grass is the same.

00:19.440 --> 00:21.680
Artificial grass, I would go out on a limb

00:21.680 --> 00:25.840
and say it's probably been tapped a little bit

00:25.840 --> 00:28.840
because it's the thing that we use for the training.

00:28.880 --> 00:31.520
And artificial grass isn't like concrete

00:31.520 --> 00:33.480
where it's done every single location.

00:33.480 --> 00:35.560
So artificial grass, you're gonna find deals,

00:35.560 --> 00:37.800
but you're gonna have to look a little bit harder,

00:37.800 --> 00:40.000
but it's a good niche and so is masonry, okay?

00:40.000 --> 00:41.840
So yes, yes to both.
