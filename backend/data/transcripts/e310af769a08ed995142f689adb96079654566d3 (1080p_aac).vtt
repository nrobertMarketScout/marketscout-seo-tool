WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.680
Alright, now that we have the frame and we added the content, we interlinked everything,

00:09.680 --> 00:14.200
we are going to do the on-page SEO.

00:14.200 --> 00:16.040
Let's start with the page title.

00:16.040 --> 00:22.160
So the page title is, I have our Bentonville Concrete website up here.

00:22.160 --> 00:28.920
The page title is what comes up when you hover at the very top of the website.

00:28.920 --> 00:37.820
So we like to keep the page title between 50 to 60 characters and to add that on Weebly,

00:37.820 --> 00:44.500
so we select, we're going to do this for every page except for the contact as page.

00:44.500 --> 00:51.760
We are going to do it but it's not going to be to SEO because the contact page, we don't

00:51.760 --> 00:56.240
really care for the ranking as much as the other pages, we don't add content, it's just

00:56.240 --> 00:59.200
a way for people to submit a form.

00:59.200 --> 01:05.080
So you're going to click on pages, you're going to click on the home one, right here

01:05.080 --> 01:12.720
under and don't get it confused with the page name, that's just the home, go into SEO settings

01:12.720 --> 01:22.160
and up here in the page title, we usually like to do service comma service comma location.

01:22.160 --> 01:31.000
So for our website it would be, and again you can pick the keywords that are most representing

01:31.000 --> 01:37.380
of your business, the ones that rank the most are the ones with the most volume in search

01:37.380 --> 01:41.580
that you probably want to have for the home page.

01:41.580 --> 01:51.120
So concrete contractors and then concrete, we could even do company, Queen Creek is a

01:51.120 --> 02:01.240
pretty long location, so let's see if, and then make sure you add the state, let's copy

02:01.240 --> 02:16.280
this and ward counter, okay, we usually use the wardcounter.net, it's pretty easy, okay

02:16.440 --> 02:22.560
Okay, we're 55 characters, so we're good, and then let's do the ones for the other service

02:22.560 --> 02:29.700
pages, I have a stamped concrete right here, so obviously the page title for that is going

02:29.700 --> 02:48.000
to be stamped concrete, stamped concrete, we can do like decorative concrete, you want

02:48.000 --> 02:52.860
to really pay attention to how you're spelling things, make sure you're putting everything

02:53.020 --> 02:59.820
in the word counter too, to make sure you're not going over 60 characters, let's do concrete

02:59.820 --> 03:11.540
driveway, let me see what we did here, okay, I'm actually just going to put it in here

03:11.540 --> 03:28.180
so I don't have to copy and paste it, so let's do concrete driveway, concrete dollars, okay,

03:28.180 --> 03:34.980
that works, let's copy and paste it, pretty easy, especially once you have your keyword

03:34.980 --> 03:44.620
extended and you know exactly what you want to target, and then let's do concrete patio,

03:44.620 --> 03:48.860
the first keyword should be fairly simple, if it is too long for the location and you

03:48.860 --> 03:53.540
don't fit two keywords, just pick one keyword if that's the case, it's always better to

03:53.540 --> 04:13.020
do less than to go over, okay, so could do walkway or sidewalk, really again just look

04:13.020 --> 04:17.400
at your keyword list and the ones with the highest volume that are related to the content

04:17.400 --> 04:21.520
that you're going to add to the page is what you want to put, so definitely if you have

04:21.560 --> 04:25.640
a homepage for concrete patio, you definitely want to put concrete patio in the page title,

04:25.640 --> 04:31.920
and then the second keyword I would probably do whatever it is that has a high search and

04:31.920 --> 04:41.800
you're going to talk about in that page, concrete patio, and make sure you publish, you need to

04:41.800 --> 04:47.200
publish everything, and then for the contact page we usually like to keep it simple, so I would

04:47.200 --> 04:57.000
probably just put contact, Queen Creek, concrete, and then make sure you publish, save everything,

04:57.000 --> 04:59.040
and you're done.
