Okay, now we are going to cover how much content do you really need on your website and I would

00:11.740 --> 00:14.760
say that you want to look at your competition.

00:14.760 --> 00:18.480
So once you do the due diligence, you know what the top three websites are that are ranking

00:18.480 --> 00:19.840
in that area.

00:19.840 --> 00:24.640
Look at how much content they have on their pages and double that, double the competition.

00:24.640 --> 00:29.780
So do better than everyone else that you're trying to rank for.

00:29.780 --> 00:35.180
And then the standard, if you want to know an average, would be we usually do 2,000 words

00:35.180 --> 00:41.540
for the homepage and then we do 1,000 words for each service pages.

00:41.540 --> 00:42.820
So that's 3,000.

00:42.820 --> 00:50.100
If you have a website with one homepage and three service pages, that is 5,000 words worth

00:50.100 --> 00:51.700
of content.

00:51.700 --> 00:57.860
And then I know that we have a contact page, but we actually do not write content for the

00:57.860 --> 00:59.620
contact page.

00:59.620 --> 01:01.100
And that is it.
