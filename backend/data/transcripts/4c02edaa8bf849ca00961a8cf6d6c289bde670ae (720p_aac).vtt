How can I sell a hooked business owner within consistent leads, working on the first deal?

00:05.360 --> 00:11.440
Trey, this time of year, it's all in the setup. This time of year, and for anyone listening,

00:11.440 --> 00:14.560
this is what you need to do, at least from now until it gets to be about spring,

00:15.280 --> 00:20.480
you need to make sure not to pigeonhole yourself. What I mean by that is if you call a business

00:20.480 --> 00:23.520
owner, you hook them and you go, hey, I'm going to get you three leads, and then we're going to

00:23.520 --> 00:27.040
talk in three days. Well, guess what? If you don't get three leads, you look like a dumbass.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.760
So what I do at this time of year is I call the business owner, I'm just really open about it.

00:31.760 --> 00:35.200
I'm like, hey, I'm going to get you a couple of leads. It might be in a couple of days,

00:35.200 --> 00:38.880
it might be in a couple, it might be a week, it might be 10 days. I want to get you a couple

00:38.880 --> 00:44.880
really good ones. So let's talk once I do that. And I just leave it at that. That way, I'm not

00:44.880 --> 00:49.200
pigeonholed into it. But typically, the question you're asking, I'm guessing what happened is you

00:49.200 --> 00:52.480
call the business owner, you hook them, and you're like, hey, I'm going to get you a couple of leads,

00:52.480 --> 00:56.080
and you almost made it sound like you're going to have them three leads in three days,

00:56.080 --> 01:00.480
which during the spring, winter, or spring, summer, and fall might be realistic. And it's

01:00.480 --> 01:04.800
like, okay, it's winter. And now the business owner, you're like, shit, is the business

01:04.800 --> 01:08.400
thinking I'm just lying? Does the business owner think I'm full of shit? Whatever.

01:08.400 --> 01:12.240
And so that's the position you're in. So for the specific deal that you're doing,

01:12.240 --> 01:17.840
and maybe you're referencing a deal that you have hooked, you're going to need to just get

01:17.840 --> 01:21.840
gritty, man. You're going to need to go, and what I would do is use some of the Facebook strategies,

01:21.840 --> 01:26.800
go into groups, go into those cities, and search for specific keywords, and see if there's anyone

01:26.800 --> 01:31.280
you can just kind of hustle for. That's what I would do for that specific deal. And if you

01:31.280 --> 01:36.080
have more context that you can share on this thread or DM me, let's talk about it. But I'm

01:36.080 --> 01:40.640
talking about for future deals from now until the spring. Guys, don't pigeonhole yourselves.

01:40.640 --> 01:44.240
Don't make it sound like you're going to get them three leads in 24 hours or in three days

01:44.240 --> 01:50.160
when you don't know. Okay? Keep it open. They don't know that you've given other clients,

01:50.160 --> 01:54.160
they don't know that you gave somebody two months ago three leads in 24 hours or three leads in

01:54.160 --> 02:00.320
three days. They don't have any context. So it's not a big deal. If it's not a big deal to you,

02:00.320 --> 02:04.960
it's not going to be a big deal to them. So if you're talking about a deal you already have hooked,

02:04.960 --> 02:08.560
then my advice would, you're going to have to do some strategies, and you can message me or

02:08.560 --> 02:12.080
comment here or post in the group, because I know a lot of us have talked about these last winter.

02:13.040 --> 02:19.120
But for deals going forward, and this is for everybody, don't pigeonhole yourself in. Do

02:19.120 --> 02:23.200
not pigeonhole yourself in. Do not make it seem like you're going to get three leads in three days.

02:23.760 --> 02:28.000
Just keep it, whatever. Hey, I'm going to get you a couple of leads and then let's talk.

02:28.560 --> 02:32.640
Okay? It might be a couple of days. It might be a week. It might be 10 days. You know how it is

02:32.640 --> 02:36.240
this time of year, Mr. Business Owner. It's Christmas, whatever. I'll get them to you,

02:36.240 --> 02:40.960
then let's talk. Does that sound fair? Awesome. Cool. Boom. You're done. And now if it takes you

02:40.960 --> 02:46.000
10 days, cool. But guess what? If you get the three leads in three days or three leads in five days,

02:46.000 --> 02:48.320
you look like a hero. Okay? So that's my answer.
