1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,380
So Aaron asked the question again, real quick, by the way, hold on who I heard you say somebody's

2
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:13,180
new who you mentioned that was new Daniel true Daniel welcome to the call.

3
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:17,280
You're in for a treat and I know Aaron real quick we can make a plug.

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:25,400
We are like, we have committed to quadrupling down on the value and I've said this for about

5
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,640
a month, maybe a little bit longer but yeah there's going to be a lot of.

6
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:35,120
For those of you that have been around a while, you guys are going to see a huge uptick in.

7
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:42,560
I don't know if I'd say service or just raw value that we're going to be giving you guys

8
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:47,800
and so we're talking about this almost every day so anyway, Daniel welcome to call anyone

9
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,600
else that's brand new on this I'm going to try to pull Facebook here I'm going to log

10
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,280
in while Francesca answer this question but welcome to this call.

11
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,040
The purpose is with this is to give you guys, you know, everything that we you need to know

12
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,960
is in the training you could go through the training that could be training.

13
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,280
You don't need me, you could be training plus the community, you have every answer to every

14
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,200
question you could possibly have, however, we try to come on here to give you just that

15
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:18,120
extra training the the the new updates the this the that the specific nuance questions

16
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,480
because we can never, it'd be impossible to answer every single question but here's the

17
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:26,120
great part is if you guys ask these questions on these calls, like Aaron's about to ask

18
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:30,840
Francesca, we're going to cut that a little assuming the answer doesn't suck, Francesca

19
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,720
we're going to cut it.

20
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,720
Just kidding.

21
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,640
And then we're going to put that inside of the Kajabi training so that we can have the

22
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,840
specific questions the nuanced questions as many as possible inside the training.

23
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:45,800
So if you guys have been in this group, the training changes every single week we literally

24
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:51,240
have add we add one to three to five new videos every single week I don't know if you guys

25
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,360
continually logging in but we want you guys in there and checking it out.

26
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,320
So that said, go ahead and ask the question let's get into it.

27
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,320
Yeah, absolutely.

28
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,800
So Daniel says, how do you vet these videos instead of just picking the first one?

29
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:11,680
Yeah, so I think it starts when you're transferring the free leads to them and your live transferring

30
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:17,080
yourself like that's the first thing that you want to watch out is to the sound professional,

31
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,480
you know, that's the first thing that you really notice and usually that gives you a

32
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,840
pretty good idea.

33
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,560
And then the second one is when you get on a zoom call, also like the follow up like

34
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,640
when you follow up on those leads that you sent over how quicker they do answer the closing

35
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,200
them if not do they have stupid excuses.

36
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,800
So that's another thing.

37
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:38,000
And then another one would be when you get on a zoom call before you kind of start you

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,400
ask them questions like are you looking to grow where are you at gather as much as information

39
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,480
before you even start going into you know wasting too much time and that would probably

40
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,720
be the final thing you do to check it.

41
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,200
You kind of get a pretty good idea after you do all of that to be honest especially after

42
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:59,080
you close a bunch of them because you get the senses that kind of tell you this is good

43
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,080
this is not good.

44
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,200
Yeah, do you have a couple like specifics real quick on this question like and that

45
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,520
opening cold call obviously this is a little hard because it's a balance if you don't want

46
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,440
to get hung up on but then also you don't want to agree to give them free leads if they're

47
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,400
not a good fit like what are some telltale signs you look on and that first cold call

48
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,800
of like if they're maybe a good fit or not.

49
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:24,640
Yeah, I think like breaking that relationship during the cold calling is way easier than

50
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,760
waiting to do the zoom call anyway.

51
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,840
So you if you catch something off I would almost suggest being stricter then because

52
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,680
that way you're not wasting too much time you know because there's always going to be

53
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,360
not always but you're going to have a few more free leads to send someone else at that

54
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,360
point.

55
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:46,360
I would say like if you transfer I had one I remember I transferred the lead and he

56
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:52,360
wouldn't talk so I said hello are you there and we're like all he would say was yeah

57
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:59,240
like introduce yourself like say something and that to me was like okay no like he wouldn't

58
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:04,360
say you know anything his name nothing even you know you introduce them but still like

59
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:09,240
you've got to have someone that sounds alive on the other end so stuff like that like you

60
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:14,200
just kind of feel off I would say that sounds unprofessional or I've had a few like you

61
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,720
transfer the lead they sound good and then when you check in on them and say hey how

62
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,280
did that go did you close them did you give them a quote and they get back to you saying

63
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:27,560
um I didn't have enough time I have to call them back then you're like okay stuff like

64
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:33,720
that will make you kind of wonder you'll know yeah for sure and like actually like I added

65
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:40,520
one quick thing like they got to want leads if they're a cavalier about it you don't really have

66
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:45,160
that much control if they're like and we're doing pretty good like they could be lying so it could

67
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,760
be a smoke screen so you don't want to address that but like I remember talking with one dude

68
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:53,800
he was like 55 I don't know what I was thinking homeboy was not ready to hustle for more leads

69
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,640
right and so I didn't really have like any leverage or any control because he didn't care

70
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:05,640
and so in that situation you like the guys that are hungry to grow again just because someone

71
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,680
says we're doing good doesn't mean they actually aren't hungry and they could get really hooked

72
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:14,680
by your free leads but that's still something to focus on and you can do the pull back then

73
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:19,560
like if they act like that and they're like well I'm already and then be like then what did you

74
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:25,000
agree on getting a few free jobs if you're already great right do you want them or do you not then

75
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,440
you're like you can just be honest with me you know you know I'm a big man you can just tell me

76
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:37,000
and then they're usually like no that's not what I meant or whatever something done like that

77
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,280
that's usually what they say looks like nick has his hand up yeah um

78
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:52,760
um machete okay just want to get your attention um funny that aaron said that um the number one

79
00:05:52,760 --> 00:06:00,200
thing in a business owner is a hungry business owner right because they they you're not going

80
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:05,640
to find that you can't as much as I would love to have every business owner be good at sales

81
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:11,640
most of them suck like they're they're like old plumber let's say it's in the plumbing industry

82
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:16,360
for septic right we do submit they're probably an old plumber that decided to open their company

83
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:20,760
they're not trained in sales not always if you find the one that are that are good at plumbing

84
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:26,760
and business people those ones are really good typically you don't find that so you have to

85
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:35,480
remember it's kind of like like I guess so aaron aaron is is is currently single just fyi for any

86
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:40,760
of the ladies out there um at some point aaron's gonna start freaking working the field aaron's

87
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:46,040
gonna start hunting you know he's gonna start freaking prowling around and uh he's gonna want

88
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:50,600
to have a list of things even if it's in his head of things that he's looking for and as much as

89
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,920
he'd like to have every single one of those things which he could he may be looking for a long time

90
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,520
and so you kind of have to have this list within your head of like what do you want that business

91
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:03,000
owner it's your partner what are the things ideally you would want that business owner to have

92
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,520
and then in what order are they most important and to me the most important thing is is a hunger

93
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:12,920
for leads because if they're hungry for leads then they're gonna do their very very best and

94
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:17,880
they may not be perfect on the phone they may sound really gravely and scary and they might

95
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:22,120
have not great customer service but at least they're hungry they're following up they want

96
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:27,560
that business on the other hand they can be the best talker in the world they can be the best

97
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,480
whatever communicator but if they're not hungry for the leads they're not like francesca said

98
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:35,560
they're not going to call them they're not going to address them they're not going to um they're

99
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,120
you're going to really really get frustrated so to me the number one thing i look for is a hungry

100
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:44,600
business owner and how do we know that guys aaron how do we know someone's hungry typically

101
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:51,000
when they actually are responsive they're responsive but also going back to building the

102
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,360
list is they're already paying yeah we're already paying because if they're already paying they're

103
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:02,360
either a hungry for more leads or b they're they're allergic to money right and the chance

104
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:12,920
of it being b is low right so great question awesome well that's it yeah i say this a lot

105
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,720
just because somebody's willing to give you money doesn't mean you should take it

106
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:21,640
yeah we were talking about that earlier we've all gotten the business owner we know we can close

107
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:25,640
them we know they give us the money but you just know deep down they're not going to stay with you

108
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:29,640
for a long time and i will say at the beginning when you start your business sometimes you just

109
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:34,200
get that deal to get that win get a little money coming in but you'll get to a point where you

110
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,280
realize that person even though i might be able to get them for the next three months it's going

111
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:43,720
to tie me up during the best time of year i'd rather skip them and wait another two three weeks

112
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,960
and it's hard to make that big boy big girl decision because now you have to cold call again

113
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,720
now you have to go through all the heart the headache and the heartache of doing this again

114
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:57,640
but if you do that deal that's six months you're going to tie yourself up during the best time and

115
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:02,600
you might miss out on a better business owner so once you've been in it a while you realize that

116
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:08,120
not all money is money that you should take and sometimes you can get a deal and you choose not

117
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,880
to get a deal because you know it's not going to last because they as aaron said are not going to

118
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,440
make money if they don't make money they're not going to stay with you no matter how

119
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:20,360
great the money sounds it's not long-term money it's not big money it's not you know forever money

120
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:27,000
for sure so with these questions guys if we have time we will do questions at the end we're getting

121
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,720
some great comments but i'll probably kind of just like slowly exit out here and let you guys

122
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:37,720
handle the topic of the call of how to replace a client beautiful um are you gonna stay on this

123
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:42,840
call are you hopping off to get to work no i'll stay on because i don't want to like mess up the

124
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:46,760
hosting with yeah stay on and then i'm gonna have you check the comments i'm not even going

125
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,960
to worry about logging on facebook and have you check the comments and then anything that's

126
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:57,000
pertinent to what we're talking about then i want you to jump in and ask it so um really quick i

127
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,800
don't know this could take a while this could not take a while but what i want to the the focus of

128
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:06,120
today's call is i want to talk about getting a new client um replacing your business owner

129
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:12,120
and so a couple things and i wanted to bring francesca on because she just replaced a business

130
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:17,240
owner when was this this is just you just replaced this person like last week

131
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:24,040
yeah so we're going to talk about this this is something that is going to happen so number one

132
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:31,160
you guys i want to say is that you are going to have to do this and sometimes it's not your fault

133
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:36,760
right sometimes you're producing great leads nothing's changed and the business owner

134
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:44,600
they're bad at managing money they something happens and you know what they they they start

135
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:49,320
cutting they start cutting costs and they're not they're not long-sighted enough to realize

136
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,360
that they're cutting the very thing that's actually growing their business and they're

137
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:57,800
going to call you and say hey i i just don't want to pay for these leads anymore and that's just a

138
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,960
reality so you are going to have to replace clients it's just part of the game don't feel bad

139
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:06,840
don't you know crawl in bed it's just going to happen right and i need you guys to remember that

140
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:14,600
this is the same as physical real estate if you own a fourplex you can't assume that the first

141
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:19,800
four people you put in there are never going to leave guess what sometimes those people are there

142
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:24,840
while they gather enough money to go build their own house and sometimes your business owners are

143
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:30,920
taking your leads long enough that they can go and they can start you know you know really putting

144
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:35,400
some time and energy and effort into their own website and generating their own leads and guess

145
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:40,120
what hopefully you you they trust you and you gain enough of their trust that they'll come to you and

146
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:46,120
you can do that for them but sometimes business owners they they move out right they go on to

147
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:51,400
other things and sometimes just like tenants maybe their friends are at this other place

148
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:57,640
and there's a pool there right or there's it's closer to their work and they decide that they're

149
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:03,640
going to move over there they're going to move their money over there and all you can do just

150
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:08,520
like if you own the fourplex you could make it the best fourplex in town you could add as many

151
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:14,040
amenities as possible you could be the the easy to call easy to get a hold of good communication

152
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:19,240
make sure everything's always working you can make that the best possible situation but sometimes

153
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:23,640
you are in the wrong location and it's nothing you can do and so you have to remember that even

154
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:31,480
in physical real estate no matter how good your property is people just move that's it also in

155
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:36,360
physical real estate guess what you could do everything right and sometimes people are just

156
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:42,040
crappy people just don't pay their bill people just think that they can sit in your property

157
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:46,200
and they don't have to pay you right and they're entitled whatever and you have to replace them you

158
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:50,920
have to evict them and guess what guys sometimes you got to evict your business owners out of these

159
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:56,280
websites and the good thing is is in this business it's really easy to evict you just take the tracking

160
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:00,760
number and you switch it to somewhere else and you take the the the quote forms and you push them

161
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:07,560
somewhere else that's it you're done completely completely done okay so um we want to go through

162
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:11,240
this really quick and i want to just talk to francesca because she just did this and kind of

163
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:15,960
go step by step on how to replace it we're going to talk about two different things number one

164
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:20,200
we're going to talk about how to replace a business how to replace uh a new get a new business owner

165
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:26,120
for a website that doesn't have a tenant maybe they moved out on their own and now you're stuck

166
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,480
and you don't have any money coming in and that's a little bit more urgent because you're not making

167
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:33,880
money and then if we have time i want to talk about replacing a business owner when you already

168
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:40,520
have a business owner finding having a a business owner in tow to come and then drive the other one

169
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:46,520
out onto the street and do so you know happily put them get them create make the business owner

170
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:52,840
homeless you know metaphorically and uh and get somebody else in there so francesca let's talk

171
00:13:52,840 --> 00:14:00,280
about when we have a website let's use one of our websites that's currently vacant right like i know

172
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:06,280
uh is it st george tree service that recently became vacant yeah okay st george tree service

173
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:11,160
we had a really good client we signed them in 2020 they were with us for over three years and

174
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:15,720
it was again one of these examples they basically were like hey we're gonna go a different direction

175
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:20,920
and i think based on what i've seen they probably had their niece or nephew or somebody at a dinner

176
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:25,560
party was like oh i could do a really good job for you for you're spending a thousand dollars

177
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:29,800
and they probably are building their own website whatever and they're good people i'm still friends

178
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:36,040
them on facebook um you know i'm never gonna just burn bridges right but they decided to

179
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:43,000
to move a different direction so i know we also replaced that tenant with one of our other

180
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,560
tenants that covered this area kind of but they had to drive and it didn't really work out

181
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:52,520
so we have this property it's vacant st george tree service what you know and i know we've been

182
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:57,480
focusing on some other properties before this we just uh did a new one and also guys remember

183
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:03,240
even us we have to do this too so you guys should realize this is just a thing francesca what's the

184
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:07,960
next step right now we have a vacant property st george tree service what's our very next step

185
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:15,320
what are you doing and what is our process that anyone could follow yeah so the first thing i do

186
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:23,160
especially we ended things on a good note is i honestly just ask them and say hey like would

187
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:29,080
you have someone else that you know would be like kind of ask for a referral and i offer like

188
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:35,960
a gift card something small um so i do that first if that doesn't work and they don't know anyone

189
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:45,160
they do know people but they don't want to give you anyone um right um i rebuilt that prospecting

190
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:49,400
list of business owners especially when it's been a while because you might have new businesses that

191
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:55,400
came in people are buying ads now whatever it may be i get that refreshed up i also do a due

192
00:15:55,400 --> 00:16:01,240
diligence just in case i want to see like if things change because keep in mind like especially for a

193
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:07,000
client that you had for three years most likely the ads you really lowered because you started

194
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,280
ranking so i just redo the due diligence as well kind of see where we're at i do a little digging

195
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:17,560
on the leads that we're getting i honestly don't i feel like it's more pressure when you're starting

196
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:23,480
a new project than when you're trying to replace one because you do have experience in that project

197
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:29,560
already you already did half of the work for it and then you know kind of what to expect in terms

198
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:36,520
of leads for the year most of the time so you have that going going for you and then then i just start

199
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:44,280
cold calling so that would be those would be the steps in that case so a couple things number one

200
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:51,800
is that it sounds funny to ask for a referral but it is true and sometimes these business owners

201
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:56,680
they actually feel bad because they like you they made money with you and for whatever reason they

202
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:00,360
just want to go a different direction and sometimes it's not even against you so i think it's really

203
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:07,800
wise to ask because you can actually get referrals and do it in a very strategic way where you don't

204
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:12,920
come off desperate like maybe say hey sorry sorry to interrupt i just thought about something that

205
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:18,680
really works if they have a contract let's say it's august now the contract is up in october one

206
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:24,120
thing that really works is oh i know like you're going a different direction what if you help me

207
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:30,760
you know find someone else to replace you we can shorten your contract money and get them on before

208
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:36,680
so they can take over your contract that really really works yeah then they're not on the hook

209
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:40,840
and it kind of like lets them know hey we are going to stick to this contract just so you know

210
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:45,480
so i really like that but number one ask and this is going back to so many different things

211
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,720
we talked about guys don't burn bridges don't be a dude like somebody texts you hey they're

212
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,480
going in a different direction you i know like i my immediately first response i want to go burn

213
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:59,880
their house down right like that's like the first thing i want to do like just burn their house down

214
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:05,080
you know slash their tires all that stuff that's like my first response right i carry this in my

215
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:11,800
and after that i'm like okay nick that's you know it's no it's not personal whatever and so

216
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:15,800
that's that's a great step but this is what i like that francesca said is really important

217
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:20,200
guys you should be constantly if you have projects even if they're ranking

218
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:25,560
or maybe they're partially ranking you're still spending money on ads whatever it's always good

219
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:31,240
to i would say once a year especially as you have client turnover and you're still trying to rank

220
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:35,320
is i would go and if you're ranked top of the google of google whatever that's fine

221
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:39,880
right but if you're still in the process bottom page one it's always good to go and do a little

222
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:45,400
do another due diligence see where things are at see if there's new competition in town see if

223
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:51,400
there's new people that are running ads go from a to z see that process because you'd be surprised

224
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:56,120
like there's businesses that like for example artificial grass businesses there's like four

225
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:01,560
new artificial grass businesses that have popped up in my town since we landed our client and our

226
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:05,640
client's still with us but if we were to switch over in fact i had somebody reach out to me on

227
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:10,440
instagram that we could sell those leads do we have we actually have a backup right now francesca

228
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:14,920
for our artificial grass website that i've told i think i've talked to you about that we just

229
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:21,000
can't work with because we only work with one company so um do the due diligence right keep

230
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,240
a good relationship ask them for referrals if possible and i was going to say do it in a way

231
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:31,640
that's not doesn't sound desperate hey mr business owner um you know we've got you know

232
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:36,040
two or three people that we were talking to when we decided to work with you but before i do that

233
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:40,600
since i know you and i trust you is there anyone that you would recommend or that you know that we

234
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:44,200
should talk to before i go talk to those people because i'd always appreciate someone that you

235
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:50,120
trust because these leads this is my name on this right versus hey do you know anyone i could sell

236
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:57,480
these two right you sound like the the the the desperate person that's just looking for any and

237
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:02,360
everything right yeah you you think i could you could hawk these leads for 200 bucks a month

238
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:09,400
to anybody you know what i'm saying so there's a really fine line of how to do it um and i think

239
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:13,560
i'm really professional at this because i have an ego and i never want to sound desperate like it's

240
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:17,480
really hard for me to ask for anything especially for something that makes me look and i put in

241
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:24,200
that position okay okay so you build a list right you look at the due diligence you build the list

242
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:29,560
and then does your pitch change talk to us about that does your pitch change is it back to the

243
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:34,600
exact same thing what are you doing now maybe the website's ranked it's getting a certain amount of

244
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:39,160
leads you know roughly how many leads it's getting because it's getting you know 20 to 30 leads a

245
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:46,040
month no ads or very little ads what is your pitch how does it change compared to the first time

246
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:52,120
talk talk about that for a second yeah i feel i mean i don't know why but i do feel more confident

247
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:57,640
when i'm pitching something that i already had for a longer time because like you said i know

248
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:03,480
more of the expectations i know exactly how many leads we have been getting but i still do not

249
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:10,920
tell them hey this is how much like i still keep you know keep it as a secret because i don't want

250
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:16,600
them to have high expectations and also like things can change and you never really know so

251
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:22,520
the only thing that i would say changes is the fact that you go in knowing yourself but i don't

252
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:28,040
necessarily share them you know with them hey we usually get 20 30 leads you can share like hey

253
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:32,600
we've been having this project for a very long time we used to work with you don't tell them who

254
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:38,440
unless it's a referral obviously um so you can tell them like you had yes of course you can take

255
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:44,200
that and tell them but you don't go you still don't want to promise them 20 30 leads a month

256
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:50,520
because if for some reason december you're not getting them they call you up smart as much as

257
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:56,840
you want to i never like to leave with that um unless it's getting like 50 consistently and then

258
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:02,360
you're like yeah this thing's getting like 20 20 plus right like a number that you get like there's

259
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:07,080
no way you could go wrong on but other than that i wouldn't even try to you know give them a number

260
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:10,600
because then they're going to be they're going to be making a decision based on that number so

261
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:15,880
um my experience call after you lose a tenant and you have leads coming in consistently

262
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:21,960
it's so much easier to call it's you're you're so much more confident

263
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:29,720
because you have this project you know what it produces um you've seen it it's been consistent

264
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:33,480
you know it's not going anywhere and here's the best part is most of the time you don't have to

265
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:39,640
spend money on ads so you're all the money you're gonna get you're gonna get as mostly profit

266
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:44,920
right you're not gonna have to worry about ads and all this different stuff and so um okay so when

267
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:51,000
you do call do you you try to mention that there was somebody before talk about that like how do

268
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:57,400
you bring it up and i'm just asking you specifically i know the way that i do it um but i'm curious with

269
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:02,280
you how do you do it do you bring up that you had somebody else buying them do you just say

270
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:07,960
that you have a website is it the same exact script like tell us about that yeah it depends

271
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:12,920
like is it coming from a referral then you have to mention it because they probably have already

272
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:18,600
talked to them and you can kind of leverage that because you can ask the other guy like to give

273
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:23,400
you like a good review in that terms like they probably talk there you know he then you have that

274
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:28,920
advantage so it does depend on how did you find them did you just call call them like a new project

275
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:34,200
or was there a referral that's like the main thing and then yeah it's really based on that

276
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:40,440
like how did that come through if it's you're just calling them i mean i don't necessarily

277
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:44,840
tell them like hey we used to have this guy and we lost them so that's why i'm calling you because

278
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:52,440
you sound desperate okay i agree guys if you have websites right now that are producing leads

279
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:59,880
especially organic leads you're you're sitting on free money like that should be your number

280
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:04,440
one priority right now francesco that should be our number one priority right because it's like

281
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:13,320
this we own some office space in st george and we had you know there was a period of time where

282
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:19,880
i was in an office kyle was in an office isaac was in an office francesco was in an office i think we

283
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:25,000
had in one other person that off porter was using an office like we mainly use the offices and then

284
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:32,280
i started traveling kyle started working from home porter started working on the farm isaac was back

285
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:37,640
in portland and we were just all remote and i remember just one day and this sounds so silly

286
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:42,680
that i took me so long but i'm like dude there's literally just money like we're just like there's

287
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:47,080
free money right and so i started talking to francesco every week i'm like francesco we just

288
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:52,600
need to rent these offices out because it costs us nothing they're just it's just empty space

289
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:57,560
that can't bring in money and and that's it she started renting these offices out and i mean

290
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:06,040
i don't know what did we rent that corner one out for finally um 50 huh the corner one

291
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:12,360
yeah 650 650 bucks a month times it by 12 that was just sitting there no one is in it

292
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:18,840
right and and we we in our heads we knew we should rent it out but i mean what is that what is 650

293
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:27,320
times 12 it's like seven it's like eight thousand bucks something like that right roughly thousand

294
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:33,320
eight hundred eight eight thousand eight hundred seven seven thousand eight seven thousand eight

295
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:39,720
hundred dollars that we just were like yeah and all we had to do and francesco took photos she

296
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:44,360
put it on marketplace lo and behold we're completely booked other than we have one tiny

297
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:48,680
little office is kyle's little harry potter closet he used to work out of that uh we started letting

298
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:55,400
him work from home um because he could barely even fit in the door but besides the harry potter

299
00:25:55,400 --> 00:26:01,480
closet we're completely rented out so the fact of the matter if you guys have properties that are

300
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:08,840
rentable right now that should be your number one focus number one focus and i have a couple of

301
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:15,480
there's a couple of ideas that i could give you guys guys think outside the box on like yes build

302
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:21,400
the list right um uh go and do what we did list building the best thing to do is is go and find

303
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:25,640
people that are paying for google ads but guess what you can also you know what i do every time

304
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:31,480
i get the mail i freaking i'm collecting these things baby so right now we have a epoxy guy

305
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:36,760
but guess what as soon as epoxy guy decides to go sideways i got his replacement right here he's

306
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:42,040
spending money on paper right dude wants leads bad enough he's spending money on this stuff okay

307
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:47,640
look at that uh that's not a good one i'm not going to do carpet cleaning but i just want to

308
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:52,760
show you guys an example these guys are spending money on these cards this isn't google ads but

309
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:58,200
this costs them money these people are hungry for leads or they're stupid either way i want to talk

310
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:04,360
to you right fun to talk to stupid people sometimes look at this i got a depth cleaning back up as soon

311
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:09,400
as mr joe go ahead and write this down francesca as soon as mr joe goes sideways duck pros is

312
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:16,440
getting our leads okay boom evergreen maintenance just i got yeah i don't think that's a good one

313
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:24,120
just wanted to hold that up what's hold on i got one more for you oh look at this an artificial

314
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:30,920
grass replacement our third replacement so guys um i actually have a book downstairs

315
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:36,840
i text my son to bring it up because i don't think he got my message i there's this guy that

316
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:42,760
i know in town and he has this business called dixie direct direct direct and it's like deals

317
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:47,800
right his name's tony and he used to live by me and uh he come people they sell these books and

318
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:53,320
i always buy i don't even use them i buy them just to get ideas i literally last night i was

319
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:59,000
eating i was eating mexican food and i'm like a hundred years old i'm flipping through this deal

320
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:05,880
book and i don't give a rat's you know what about deals i do i like free money but i was more

321
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:10,280
interested in like oh interesting these guys how much because i know how much he charges right he

322
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:15,400
charges like 5 000 bucks a year so i'm like dude that's like a four or five hundred dollar a month

323
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:20,520
client right there that's probably not getting any business from this right so just wanted to

324
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:26,840
point out yes use the go and look for people paying for google ads but don't sleep on this

325
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:32,360
stuff guys somebody had to pay money to get this to your door that means they want leads this is a

326
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:40,760
hungry business owner right here okay so eagle creek landscape dude you're in trouble once we

327
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:45,560
lose our client dude eagle eagle creek they're gonna get freaking either gonna work this or

328
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:53,400
burn it on their house baby those are two options okay um one more just just a niche idea this is

329
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:58,120
kind of a side thing and then we're getting questions i never even thought about this niche

330
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:06,040
this is interesting affordable sheds and garages mobile sheds and garages that's an interesting

331
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:12,840
niche or maybe it's not even a mobile but maybe it's um just sheds and garages like detached

332
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:17,240
sheds and garage building that's an interesting one i bet those suckers right there those probably

333
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:22,840
cost five ten grand right it's a structure and i guarantee they don't cost that much to build

334
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:31,400
anyway just a niche idea for those of you that think it's saturated and on that note of replacing

335
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:37,160
a client so obviously talking about prospecting in relation to replacing a client iman says that

336
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:41,000
facebook and facebook has been an absolute goldmine for finding hungry business owners

337
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,240
but then the caveat problem is finding quality people who actually have money and don't squander

338
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:49,240
the opportunity but checking marketplace and local business groups has been really good so you can

339
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:54,760
at least possibly find engagement or interest even if not actively paying a lot of times when

340
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:59,080
you look in a facebook group and it's like the recommendations on concrete and then people will

341
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:04,280
tag yeah talk to mark mark doesn't even have a business but it's like he's the number one

342
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:09,960
recommended person it's a good lead but you have to remember that that person might be getting a

343
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:15,400
lot of inbound business so they might not be hungry but i remember i had my my very first towing client

344
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:21,320
before i sold my website to i actually sold it to shiv i don't know if you guys knew this

345
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:26,360
but shiv's actually the one that bought my freaking dumpy websites shit i freaking just

346
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:30,280
dumped that on ship i'm kidding he still makes like 600 bucks a month for the last three years

347
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:36,440
he actually won but i couldn't find a client man i went through everybody dude and towing is not

348
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:40,600
a fun one francesca just replaced our towing client and it's a hard one because towing people

349
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:44,440
are generally not that intelligent it's hard it's hard it's hard to even get motivated to talk to

350
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:48,920
these people because they're just they're just not smart like mostly right that sounds rude

351
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:56,040
they're just not i went to lunch with one dude dude's belly's hanging out freaking just i mean

352
00:30:56,040 --> 00:31:02,920
and i mean that like hanging out standing like he did doesn't care about life in the whole time

353
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:09,240
it was just the whole conversation was loud and he didn't get it right and i only say that because

354
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:15,640
they're just sloppy like wear a t-shirt that fits dude taking this guy to lunch and his t-shirt

355
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:22,360
doesn't even fit if that's not indicative of the fact he's not going to answer the phone nothing

356
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:25,800
is guys you're here we're talking to a business owner make sure their t-shirt fits that's like

357
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:33,880
number one okay okay so um where was i going with this i'm like i'm i'm i'm turning into

358
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:41,320
west here i'm clear over here and then i'm apologizing oh where was i at um long story

359
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:46,280
short guys is you can think outside the box yeah iman said facebook is a good place to get ideas

360
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:53,720
but remember the number one thing with replacing someone is a hungry business owner i'll take that

361
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:59,560
over over the good sales guy over the polished person because if they're hungry you they're

362
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:02,920
trained they're usually teachable they're coachable they're whatever so

363
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:07,080
just keep dude i have a collection of this stuff okay let's go through a couple questions really

364
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:12,200
quick awesome yeah and by the way actually guys what we're gonna do is this is something and nick

365
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,960
we actually haven't talked about this but what we'll start to do is after each live we're

366
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:21,560
transitioning things over to um a better way to handle support because obviously we've been doing

367
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:26,040
dms for the longest time and honestly guys it gets a little some it's easy to miss messages

368
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:31,480
because obviously facebook messenger is not meant for like crm right like it's just meant for like

369
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:35,240
homies interacting but what we're obviously we've announced this a while back with transitioning

370
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:38,920
things something called fresh desk it's just going to be a better support ticket system

371
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:42,440
but not only just handling messages the reason i bring that up is after each live what we're

372
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:47,480
going to start to do is actually create like a little like a cheat sheet for each of these lives

373
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:51,720
so obviously we were talking about in this one how to replace a client francesca just listed off

374
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:55,960
like five bullet points or five steps and so what we're gonna do is we're gonna put that in

375
00:32:55,960 --> 00:33:00,600
like a nice little article or a little document on fresh desk put under frequently asked questions

376
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:06,440
such as how to replace a client that way you guys can have that and i think one thing we're talking

377
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:13,240
about too is taking these lives putting them into kajabi and title you know titling them and putting

378
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:19,720
the attached digital resource with it so we're gonna try and get you guys you know instead of

379
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:23,880
having to watch the whole live again give me a look at the cheat sheet and go oh yeah here was

380
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:28,040
the bullet points whatever so yeah you guys can start expecting that guys you should be in you

381
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:32,760
should have kajabi the training bookmarked and you should be in it every day because they're we're

382
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:38,120
literally adding stuff every day like at least a couple times a week so anyway see if there's

383
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:44,840
any other questions yeah no for sure so um Mahmood said he'll take uh the harry powder closet needs

384
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:50,840
some peace and quiet love it bro come out bro every time Mahmood comes out good things happen

385
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:57,400
we we do random cold calls on the spot um let's see brad hardy said i'm in portable building niche

386
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:02,920
5k minimum i think relating to the shed idea there we go there's another niche i've never even thought

387
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:08,520
about that niche francesca can we do some due diligence on saint george utah today please today

388
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:15,400
yeah let's go ahead and do that okay this yeah for sure luke hill said i'm curious if you guys

389
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:19,960
can do a training on best way to price deals there's an immediate live nick or at least

390
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:23,640
youtube video that i remember what you kind of talked about when you went through the tool

391
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:29,240
so i can yeah will you share that and come back maybe what you can do is after we get off you can

392
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:34,040
go find it and then post it as a reply that's a really good training because there it's there's

393
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:41,000
a very calculated formula for how to price deals like we don't just guess it's literally based on

394
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,080
a formula so post that but yeah we could always do that again i don't think there's much that we

395
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:49,480
could say on top of what we already said because nothing's changed but we do have a very specific

396
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:54,280
formula on how to price deals oh yeah for sure it gives you a whole lot of confidence because

397
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:58,200
it's just math in the end it removes the emotion from sales and that's what we say in the training

398
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:02,760
too is like this is for the business owner to make it make sense but it's more for you to go

399
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:09,400
in there confidently going hey if i can even get half of what i'm thinking i can double your money

400
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:13,640
as long as you answer the freaking phone and do a decent job and you can go in there asking for a

401
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:19,080
retainer of two thousand bucks with confidence not just shaking in your boots freaking you know

402
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:25,480
with that tight t-shirt with mr towing keep going yeah for sure this is an earlier question about

403
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:29,400
the tool iman said did you build the tool are you just promoting it or kind of like just getting

404
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:38,120
so we built it we've been working on this anytime you build tools they tell you it's going to take

405
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:42,040
a certain amount of time you always are like yeah we're going to expect the worst case and it's

406
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:48,760
always like double that because so i have been it's been over a year for just so you know it's

407
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:52,760
been over one year so those of you that are think i've just been avoiding it's been a year and i

408
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:58,360
finally was like dude i'm tired of like using semrush i'm literally spending 99 bucks a month

409
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:05,000
for semrush for for the search feature and i was like annoyed so um right now i'm over

410
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:13,400
50 000 into this thing in a year so this isn't just some you know i'm not promoting you guys

411
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:18,680
know this i don't sell we haven't we don't try to sell you guys stuff right the only reason we even

412
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:24,280
talk about this is because i'm tired of using tools i don't trust and because i'm spending 99

413
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:30,520
bucks on what so yeah we built this thing and it's it's legit so and i'm we're going to talk

414
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:35,640
more about that um coming up and uh you know get into that but yeah keep going for sure we got some

415
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:41,160
good questions so matthew says is it viable to try and snatch a few leads from fb groups to use also

416
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:45,720
to close deals uh before ads take off i remember you did talk about this it's pretty hit or miss

417
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:51,320
but can work what are your thoughts on it did you know what he's asking you cut out the first half

418
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:56,840
is it viable to take going to facebook groups grab a few free leads and use those to go hook

419
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,240
a deal and get the process going while you're waiting for ads

420
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:10,840
can you repeat it sorry no you're you're good so like and uh the like facebook groups people ask

421
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:16,040
for recommendations like hey who has a local concrete guy right can we use those leads those

422
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:21,160
interested people as a form of free leads on our end to give to business owners while we're

423
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:27,000
waiting for ads to take off or even to supplement them to get the deal i think so yeah nick you did

424
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:33,480
a live on this or youtube video i think like last year the only thing i i like to use facebook group

425
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:41,000
leads to pick up the slack i don't like to use them to start a deal usually sometimes i'll use

426
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:46,920
them to hook a deal to test the market i don't love once i know the market's good to use them

427
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:52,440
because then if my ads don't kick in it's like i don't have a predictable way to continually just

428
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:58,280
scrape leads but if i'm running ads and my ads slow down it's a great way to go get like some

429
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:05,400
sweat equity deals and go get some leads that way um so my opinion is hook them use those leads to

430
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:09,560
get interest to gauge interest to call around to get somebody on the hook if you need to if you

431
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:14,280
want to do that without setting up ads but i like to have my my leads coming in from ads and then

432
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:19,960
use those as a supplement rather than my main thing because i don't i can't predict when people

433
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:25,160
are going to ask for recommendations right um so that's just my two cents but leads are leads guys

434
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:30,760
it's about strategy versus tactic the strategy is giving free leads in advance the tactic that

435
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:35,480
we're using is is google ads but guess what if you guys can if somebody in this group can come up

436
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:43,720
with a predictable um you know repeatable way to glean and and harvest leads out of facebook groups

437
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:49,720
forever and we don't have to run ads go ahead and and hit me up on dms and we'll go ahead and

438
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:53,640
implement that and stop running ads but ads is just the most predictable thing let me answer one more

439
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:58,280
question and then what i want to do erin is i want you guys to finish out the questions i got to go

440
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:01,880
take my kids to school really quick but i want you guys to finish these questions let me answer one

441
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:05,640
more yeah i think that was actually all the questions the only thing i just want to actually

442
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:09,960
give a shout out for is daniel said he has got a lot of newbie technical questions because he just

443
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:13,640
um joined but he was hoping to have a little chitchat with someone to just kind of get on the

444
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:18,680
right path so obviously daniel watch the training that's going to be like the 80 90 95 percent of

445
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:23,160
all you need to know but actually jason already messaged he's going to hop on and chat with him

446
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:27,800
so thank you jason the man everyone jason's been awesome i've probably been seeing him in the free

447
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:33,080
group lately he's been killing it um guys wrapping this call up you're going to see it inside a

448
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:38,680
kajabi you're going to see a digital resource going out um that kind of outlines this but i

449
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:43,240
think the biggest takeaway for me if you have sites that are producing leads you guys have office

450
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:48,760
space that's waiting to be rented out that costs you nothing to get a a tenant and you're you're

451
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:53,400
you're flushing money down the toilet like you're literally wiping your behind with money and

452
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,880
flushing it down the toilet it's just free money

453
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:04,840
francesca let's go get let's go get saint george tree service locked down let's go i'm going to

454
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:09,400
send you a picture of this we're going to look at this as well but before this the priority should

455
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:14,200
be your your websites that already have leads coming in because it's done you just need to

456
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:20,040
find a tenant boom you turn it on it's done it's free money so erin thank you for jumping on
