1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
You're going to answer the calls, the leads, as they come in, you're going to answer them live if you can.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Now, if you're somebody that has a day job or you missed the call, it's okay.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
You're going to call the leads back, okay?

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
And when you call these leads, you aren't going to act like a lead generation company.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
You're not going to, hey, my name is Nick with Evergreen and we're going to patch you in.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
No, no, no.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
You are just going to act like you work for a tree company or a concrete company or whatever.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You're going to keep it vague, okay?

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
You're going to call these business owners, or sorry, these leads, and you're going to call them up.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Say, hey, Janet, this is Nick with Las Vegas Tree Service.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Saw that you called.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
What do you got going on?

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
How can I help?

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Well, I was looking to get my palm tree removed.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Okay, cool.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
How big is it?

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Blah, blah, blah.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm acting like I know what I'm doing.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Okay.

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
What's your address?

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Give me your email.

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Okay.

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And then you're going to go like this.

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Janet, thanks for calling in.

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm going to call the business owner to give you a call here in just a moment.

26
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Let me get a hold of him.

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I know he's on another job and I'll get right back in touch with you.

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
By the way, I'm probably going to be calling you from my cell phone, like the one I just called you from.

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
If you see XYZ area code, it's not a scam.

30
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It's me.

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It's just my cell phone.

32
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm going to be on the move.

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So watch that.

34
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Okay, cool.

35
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Thanks, Janet.

36
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Now we go and we call the business owner and we do our cold call and we hook them.

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
We get them on the hook.

38
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And I'm going to get into that whole script.

39
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm going to call them.

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
We're going to say, here's the deal, Mr.

41
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Business owner.

42
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm going to give you three, four, five, whatever.

43
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm going to give you a couple of free leads.

44
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Okay.

45
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And I know you want them because you're already paying for home advisor or you're already paying for Google ads.

46
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So you're either allergic to money or you're looking to grow.

47
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So I'm going to give you these free.

48
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,000
All I ask in exchange is we have a conversation in a couple of days about potentially, potentially working together.

49
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Doesn't mean we're going to, but just let me earn that call.

50
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
With that, boom, that's it.
