Does Google have an issue with the same credit card being used inside multiple accounts?

00:05.760 --> 00:10.240
Not that I'm aware of. Like I said, I have probably four or five right now that I'm running

00:10.240 --> 00:15.840
and it's the same PayPal and the same Amex and no issues, but it doesn't mean I'm not going to

00:15.840 --> 00:20.800
tonight or tomorrow. That's just whatever. And we'll figure it out. We'll figure it out.

00:20.800 --> 00:22.080
So if it happens, whatever.
