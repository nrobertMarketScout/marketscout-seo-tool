1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,560
All right guys, step one of the perfect prospecting script is who you are and the pattern interrupts.

2
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,120
There's three questions that we're going to ask, but first what we're going to do is we're

3
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,400
going to do a pattern interrupt.

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,720
What I mean by that is back when I was doing door-to-door sales, as I like to relate a

5
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,480
lot of these stories, is we would knock on the door knowing people hated us.

6
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,160
People hate door-to-door people, just like your business owners.

7
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,240
These business owners that we talked to, they hate people calling their phone.

8
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,480
They just do not like it.

9
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,080
We got to look at what is everybody else doing and how do we do it differently?

10
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:45,800
One thing that we would do back when we did door-to-door is we knew we were already at

11
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,800
a disadvantage.

12
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,320
People hated door-to-door people, but there was a specific type of door-to-door that they

13
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,720
loathed and that was magazine guys.

14
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,880
I've never seen a magazine girl, that's why we call it magazine guys.

15
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,880
They were sketchy, they were scammy, they always stole your money.

16
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,720
People just hated them.

17
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,640
One of the pattern interrupts I use, and I'm just giving you an example, is I'd knock

18
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,840
on the door and be like, hey, my name's Nick, I'm with Vivint.

19
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,480
By the way, Vivint's the company I used to work for, by the way, I'd say, by the way,

20
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm not the magazine guy, don't worry, and I'd put my hands up like this.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,760
If I got a laugh out of people, I knew I had some air time.

22
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,960
I'm like, yeah, let me show you what I'm doing real quick.

23
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,800
I got right into it, transitioned in, but it was all about interrupting that pattern

24
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,160
instead of just being the guy that's like, hey, my name's Nick, I'm with a company called

25
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:33,480
Vivint, and we're doing home security, like guys, that is so cringe, okay, and likewise,

26
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,480
and this is the first thing I want to talk about before we get into anything, is the

27
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:41,600
one thing you're not gonna do is you're not gonna call and drop the name of your agency

28
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,280
and be salesy, okay?

29
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,520
This is a bad, this is what you don't want to do.

30
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:52,520
Hi, Jake, this is Nick with Evergreen Enterprises, and I'm calling you about lead generation.

31
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,880
Okay, bad, stop, do not do that, okay?

32
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,400
Here's how we're gonna pattern interrupt.

33
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,080
We're gonna look at what everyone else is doing, okay?

34
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,600
Think about it, what's everyone else doing?

35
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,600
Everyone else, home advisor, angelist, et cetera, they're calling and they're saying,

36
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,880
yeah, hey, is this the business owner?

37
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:13,720
Hey, Mr. Business Owner, and they go into this BS pitch about ranking on page one and

38
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,280
this and that, and it's roundabout and it's all this different stuff.

39
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,200
The way that we're gonna be, we're gonna do this pattern interrupt is we're gonna go firing

40
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,920
right in, asking them questions, okay?

41
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,760
We're gonna be direct and we're gonna ask them questions and we're gonna ask them three

42
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,760
questions.

43
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,840
Our pattern interrupt is intertwined with these three questions, okay?

44
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:38,120
So, first question that you're gonna ask is you're gonna ask if they do a specific service

45
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,120
within the service.

46
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,040
So, for example, if you're doing concrete, you're gonna say, hey, Jake, Nick here, quick

47
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,160
question, do you guys do patios, okay?

48
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,520
Do you guys do patios and driveways?

49
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:55,320
Or, hey, Jake, Nick here, do you guys do tree removal or just tree trimming?

50
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:59,920
Do you guys actually do the removal or do you guys do stump removal, okay?

51
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,880
You're gonna ask a question pertaining to the service, okay?

52
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:08,160
You almost wanna make it seem like they're gonna think, is this a customer?

53
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,560
Is this a contractor?

54
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,280
Is this, like, they don't know, okay?

55
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,280
Is this a lead gender?

56
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,280
They're not gonna know.

57
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,800
You're gonna pattern interrupt because you're gonna go right into it.

58
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,800
You're gonna take advantage.

59
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,400
Instead of pitching them, you're gonna ask questions, okay?

60
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,600
If someone else wants to pitch, we're gonna ask questions, okay?

61
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,600
Hey, Jake, do you guys do patios?

62
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,600
Awesome, okay?

63
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,600
That's question one.

64
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,600
Ask about the service, okay?

65
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,840
All right, guys, second question.

66
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,200
You're gonna ask that question and then the second question you're gonna ask is if they

67
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,240
cover a specific area.

68
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,720
The best way I've found, yes, you can say, hey, do you cover this zip code, but what

69
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,880
I think is better is knowing the area and using, like, a suburb name.

70
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,240
That's like, it's gold.

71
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:47,200
So, for example, I live in a city called St. George and if you look at the map, you're

72
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,160
gonna see there's a main city, St. George, then I live in Washington, technically.

73
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,200
It's actually St. George, but everyone would say I live in Washington.

74
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,680
Then there's a place called Santa Clara.

75
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:02,040
These are technically cities with their own zip codes, but within St. George, okay, I

76
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,240
live in this area called Little Valley, okay?

77
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,840
Everyone just calls it Little Valley.

78
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,760
So what I would say, like, let's say I was targeting Vegas.

79
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,000
After I asked, hey, do you do patios, cool, awesome, and you guys cover Summerlin, right?

80
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:19,040
Like, I'm targeting Vegas, but I'm gonna ask, do you guys cover Summerlin?

81
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,040
Now what this is gonna do, it's, first of all, again, they're just like, what the heck?

82
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,680
Secondly, you wanna make sure that this customer is gonna be interested in that lead, okay,

83
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,680
because it's in Summerlin.

84
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,540
Now don't ask about some stupid area.

85
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,400
Ask about the area the lead is in, okay?

86
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,240
So if the lead is actually in Las Vegas, go ahead and ask about the street.

87
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,120
Hey, do you guys cover Silver Beach Circle?

88
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,120
That's the street I live on.

89
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,000
Do you guys cover Silver Beach Circle, okay?

90
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,240
They're like, what, where's that?

91
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,320
Zip code's 84790, okay, cool, yeah, yeah, yeah, we do.

92
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,240
Okay, that's question two.

93
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,640
Question one is a question about the service.

94
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,560
Question two is a question about the area.

95
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,960
Question three, you're gonna ask them how far out they are, okay?

96
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,640
Okay, awesome, last question for you.

97
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,480
How far out are you with giving service?

98
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,640
Like, how far out are you to do an actual trigger mobile?

99
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,960
How far out are you pouring concrete?

100
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,760
I know it's really busy, like, are you guys gonna be able

101
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,400
to take anything before this decade's over?

102
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,880
Like, sometimes I'll joke.

103
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,160
Can you guys actually cover, can you get to something

104
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,520
before the end of this fiscal year?

105
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,600
Like, holy crap, like, I'll kind of joke to them.

106
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,320
They're like, oh, yeah, yeah, we are a little backed out.

107
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,280
And they're like, oh, two months.

108
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,640
Oh, no problem, not a big deal.

109
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,560
And then I'll usually say, what about for an estimate?

110
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,280
Like, what if I just need an estimate?

111
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,480
Like, how far out are you?

112
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,040
Oh, we can do that by the end of the week.

113
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,000
We can do that in 24 hours.

114
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,240
We can do that next week, cool, okay?

115
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,600
And these are what you're gonna do.

116
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,000
You're gonna ask these three questions

117
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,360
and then you're gonna do a miniature transition, okay,

118
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,080
into the second step.

119
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,000
Now, I don't wanna confuse you

120
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,240
because I told you that there's four main parts to this,

121
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,320
right?

122
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,000
Who you are, which is part of the pattern interrupt,

123
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,440
what you're doing, okay, damn good reason, the deal,

124
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,200
and then I said transition, and now I'm telling you

125
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,040
there's miniature transitions, there is.

126
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,240
Between each one of these steps,

127
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,920
there's just these miniature transitions

128
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,720
because you don't wanna just pause, okay?

129
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,240
So you get done, okay, cool,

130
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,480
it's 24 hours to give an estimate.

131
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,240
And then what you're gonna do is you're gonna transition

132
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,100
into why you're calling.

133
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,360
Awesome, Jake, so anyway, the reason I'm calling you,

134
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,600
okay, you're gonna get into why you're calling

135
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,200
and that's gonna be, that's gonna segue us

136
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,040
into the next step.

137
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:18,280
So, guys, don't be, recap, don't be salesy,

138
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,280
don't use your agency name, just get to the point.

139
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,320
Our pattern interrupt is we're gonna ask three questions,

140
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,880
bang, bang, bang, and we're gonna transition

141
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,480
into why we are calling,

142
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:31,360
and we're gonna be giving a damn good reason

143
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,720
why the hell we're calling.
