you have to remember the people we're selling to online have a bad taste of everybody they've
dealt with online. So the fact that you're coming in and showing them the social proof helps them
get over the fact that I'm not the only one about to get suckered. It's like,
okay, they're legit because they actually have clients. And it just gives them a little bit more
of a comfort when they hear that other people are using your service first, like,
oh, I'm going to get scammed by this guy.
