00:00.000 --> 00:17.720
What I hold in my hands right here is the perfect prospecting script and before we jump

00:17.720 --> 00:21.480
into this because I want to talk about the breakdown I want to talk about the overview

00:21.480 --> 00:25.560
of this script which we're going to be using but before we talk about that I want to tell

00:25.560 --> 00:27.900
you how I came up with this script.

00:27.900 --> 00:31.340
This is not something that I googled this is not something that was a swipe this is

00:31.340 --> 00:33.820
not something that somebody gave me.

00:33.820 --> 00:40.860
This right here that I hold in my hands is the product of me knocking thousands not hundreds

00:40.860 --> 00:47.980
not tens thousands of doors door to door to door making thousands of prospecting calls

00:47.980 --> 00:53.620
doing at this point I probably haven't made a thousand zoom closes at this point but we're

00:53.620 --> 00:55.820
going to be there soon.

00:55.820 --> 01:01.820
A lot okay this comes from experience this is not something that somebody gave me okay

01:01.820 --> 01:05.880
so I want to tell you when I give you something I make sure it works first and I make sure

01:05.880 --> 01:10.480
it works thousands of times so what I did is I took my knowledge of knocking on door

01:10.480 --> 01:15.420
after door after door after making prospecting call after prospecting call after prospecting

01:15.420 --> 01:20.860
call what worked what didn't work I put it into a document and that is the perfect the

01:20.860 --> 01:24.980
perfect prospecting script okay so I want to give you the breakdown really quick it's

01:25.140 --> 01:29.220
a really really simple I want to give you the outline of what it is then we're going

01:29.220 --> 01:34.340
to jump into each individual step and I'm going to give you an actual example okay so

01:34.340 --> 01:39.460
it's a really really easy process okay this this script is a really really easy four step

01:39.460 --> 01:45.220
process with one at the end I guess you could consider a step but I want to go over those

01:45.220 --> 01:49.380
steps really really quickly okay so here's what it is is we're going to it's four things

01:49.460 --> 01:56.500
made up of four things number one is who you are and it's a pattern interrupt okay so these

01:56.500 --> 02:00.340
are things that are going to happen during the prospecting script okay during the hook

02:01.380 --> 02:07.460
who you are slash pattern interrupt and I'm going to explain this okay number two is what

02:07.460 --> 02:12.100
you're doing why you're calling guys you need to give them a damn good reason why you're calling

02:12.100 --> 02:17.140
okay you need to give them a damn good reason why you're calling them and interrupting their

02:17.140 --> 02:23.700
day step three the deal what's in it for you and what's in it for them okay meaning what's

02:23.700 --> 02:28.660
the win-win and by the way most people most salespeople to get this wrong and they focus

02:28.660 --> 02:33.380
so much on what's in it for them hey you get this you get this you get this and they forget to tell

02:33.380 --> 02:38.340
the business owner hey just so you know I'm gonna make money and a lot of it okay they're so scared

02:38.340 --> 02:41.620
to do that and they forget to tell the business owner that the only thing the business owner is

02:41.620 --> 02:46.900
thinking is what's the catch they like it they're in they're interested but they're thinking there's

02:46.900 --> 02:50.660
got to be a catch there's got to be a catch he keeps telling me good good good good good what's

02:50.660 --> 02:57.140
what's his motive okay so don't forget this part so what the deal so step three what is the deal

02:57.140 --> 03:01.060
okay what's in it for them and what's in it for you and I would say it's more important to focus

03:01.060 --> 03:06.980
on what's in it for you because they can clearly see what's in it for them step four is transition

03:06.980 --> 03:12.740
and one thing that's going to really really help you guys in these calls specifically the the hook

03:12.740 --> 03:19.140
process is your transitions okay there's times to pause there's times not to pause and we're

03:19.140 --> 03:25.860
gonna work a lot on our transitions and once we deliver our pitch how we can seamlessly transition

03:25.860 --> 03:29.780
okay so when I was doing door-to-door sales we would deliver the pitch and our transition had

03:29.780 --> 03:36.340
to be fire if we didn't transition well slam door okay same exact thing you guys don't transition

03:36.340 --> 03:41.620
well you're gonna get hung up on okay and then lastly we're gonna talk about the pullback which

03:41.620 --> 03:49.300
is we're gonna talk about what that is when to use it how often to use it it's an actual secret

03:49.300 --> 03:56.180
weapon so the overview guys just to recap one more time is this who you are slash pattern interrupt

03:56.180 --> 04:01.540
okay number two what you're doing damn good reason why you're calling them number three

04:01.540 --> 04:08.580
what is the deal okay what's in it for them what's in it for you step four transition and we're also

04:08.580 --> 04:13.860
gonna talk about the pullback that is what makes up the perfect prospecting script guys and I do

04:13.860 --> 04:18.340
want to share this there are people that have come through this program already that looked me in the

04:18.340 --> 04:22.500
eye and said nick I am terrified of the phone you have no idea and I said oh I get it man I get it

04:22.500 --> 04:29.220
no no you don't get it I won't even answer the the leads like this scares me this little piece

04:29.220 --> 04:33.620
of metal piece of plastic it scares me I'm terrified and I've watched those same people

04:34.260 --> 04:39.940
take this script take some hot leads that were coming in call a list of people who are already

04:39.940 --> 04:45.540
sold on the product and turn it into thousands upon thousands of dollars per month so if you're

04:45.540 --> 04:49.860
somebody that's sitting there going oh my gosh nick I'm scared welcome to the club okay everybody

04:49.860 --> 04:54.180
is but when you have the script when you have the right list and you got hot leads it's a total

04:54.180 --> 05:01.780
game changer let's go in
