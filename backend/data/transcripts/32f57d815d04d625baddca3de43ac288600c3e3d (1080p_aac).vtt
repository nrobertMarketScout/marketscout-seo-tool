How many ads can you run on regular ads if it's not an MCC?

00:04.400 --> 00:06.320
Good question. Does anyone know? Is there a max?

00:07.760 --> 00:12.800
I've ran like 20 on my brand new account. It's like three weeks old, over 20.

00:12.800 --> 00:18.640
And that's on like one account, the Gmail, one account, and then just 20 campaigns inside of that?

00:18.640 --> 00:22.880
20 campaigns inside of it, yes. I have to like scroll down to see all my smart campaigns.

00:22.880 --> 00:27.920
So we know, Yvette, at least 20. Well, we'll see. I have a feeling Archer's

00:27.920 --> 00:31.600
going to push the envelope on that. Yeah, I'm slapping five more up today.

00:33.600 --> 00:34.720
I love it. Okay.
