00:00.480 --> 00:03.280
The number one thing in a business owner

00:03.280 --> 00:06.680
is a hungry business owner, right?

00:06.680 --> 00:09.600
Because they, you're not gonna find,

00:09.600 --> 00:12.360
you can't, as much as I would love

00:12.360 --> 00:15.040
to have every business owner be good at sales,

00:15.040 --> 00:16.240
most of them suck.

00:16.240 --> 00:18.600
Like they're like old plumber,

00:18.600 --> 00:21.040
let's say it's in the plumbing industry for septic, right?

00:21.040 --> 00:22.200
Cause we do septic.

00:22.200 --> 00:23.480
They're probably an old plumber

00:23.480 --> 00:24.720
that decided to open their own company.

00:24.720 --> 00:26.680
They're not trained in sales, not always.

00:26.680 --> 00:29.120
If you find one that are good at plumbing

00:29.120 --> 00:31.720
and business people, those ones are really good.

00:31.720 --> 00:33.400
Typically you don't find that.

00:33.400 --> 00:38.400
So you have to remember, it's kind of like,

00:38.440 --> 00:42.720
like I guess, so Aaron, Aaron is currently single,

00:42.720 --> 00:45.480
just FYI for any of the ladies out there.

00:45.480 --> 00:48.160
At some point, Aaron's gonna start fricking working

00:48.160 --> 00:50.920
the field, Aaron's gonna start hunting, you know?

00:50.920 --> 00:53.200
He's gonna start fricking prowling around

00:53.200 --> 00:55.800
and he's gonna wanna have a list of things,

00:55.800 --> 00:58.320
even if it's in his head of things that he's looking for.

00:58.320 --> 01:00.080
And as much as he'd like to have every single

01:00.080 --> 01:01.960
one of those things, which he could,

01:01.960 --> 01:03.320
he may be looking for a long time.

01:03.320 --> 01:05.040
And so you kind of have to have this list

01:05.040 --> 01:06.440
within your head of like, what do you want

01:06.440 --> 01:08.320
that business owner, it's your partner.

01:08.320 --> 01:09.960
What are the things ideally you'd want

01:09.960 --> 01:11.400
that business owner to have?

01:11.400 --> 01:13.560
And then in what order are they most important?

01:13.560 --> 01:17.400
And to me, the most important thing is a hunger for leads.

01:17.400 --> 01:19.160
Because if they're hungry for leads,

01:19.160 --> 01:21.240
then they're gonna do their very, very best.

01:21.240 --> 01:23.400
And they may not be perfect on the phone.

01:23.400 --> 01:25.800
They may sound really gravely and scary

01:25.800 --> 01:27.880
and they might have not great customer service,

01:27.880 --> 01:29.960
but at least they're hungry, they're following up,

01:29.960 --> 01:32.160
they want that business.

01:32.160 --> 01:34.840
On the other hand, they can be the best talker

01:34.840 --> 01:37.640
in the world, they can be the best whatever communicator.

01:37.640 --> 01:38.760
But if they're not hungry for the leads,

01:38.760 --> 01:39.840
they're not, like Francesca said,

01:39.840 --> 01:41.040
they're not gonna call them.

01:41.040 --> 01:42.080
They're not gonna address them.

01:42.080 --> 01:45.400
They're not gonna, you're gonna really,

01:45.400 --> 01:46.320
really get frustrated.

01:46.320 --> 01:48.000
So to me, the number one thing I look for

01:48.000 --> 01:49.440
is a hungry business owner.

01:49.440 --> 01:51.160
And how do we know that guys?

01:51.160 --> 01:53.560
Aaron, how do we know someone's hungry typically?

01:54.560 --> 01:56.600
When they actually are responsive?

01:56.600 --> 01:58.800
They're responsive, but also going back

01:58.800 --> 02:00.560
to building the list is-

02:00.560 --> 02:01.640
Oh, they're already paying for it, yeah.

02:01.640 --> 02:02.960
They're already paying for it.

02:02.960 --> 02:04.480
Because if they're already paying,

02:04.480 --> 02:07.320
they're either A, hungry for more leads,

02:07.320 --> 02:10.080
or B, they're allergic to money, right?

02:10.080 --> 02:13.800
And the chance of it being B is low, right?

02:13.800 --> 02:15.280
So, great question.
