1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,520
I'm gonna go live and push stream, I'm already streaming I think.

2
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:18,800
Start streaming.

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:26,640
Alright Porter, let's check Facebook and see if we're live here.

4
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,360
I think we are dude, let me see.

5
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,360
Sure.

6
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:34,880
Yeah it says you're live, yeah we're live.

7
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,280
Okay dope.

8
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,280
Alright.

9
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:45,880
Let me go, I don't know why, oh there it is, boom.

10
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,480
Okay dude, let's wait a second, we'll see if anyone comes up.

11
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,400
Can you tag people on the stream like you can in a group or not?

12
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,640
I don't know, let me see.

13
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:00,680
Hey dude, let me try it, see hold on.

14
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:05,400
I do add, yeah I think you can tag people, you can probably tag everybody.

15
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,440
I'm trying to do tag everyone, trying to drop a comment on the stream and see if it will

16
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:15,600
let me, oh there we go Porter's watching, that's, maybe it's app followers you do, yeah

17
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,720
it's app followers, come check this out.

18
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,080
Alright dope.

19
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:29,360
Okay so, let's just jump into this dude, we gotta, I know you're doing stuff, you're,

20
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,720
I mean tell everyone what you're doing by the way.

21
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:38,520
I'll give you a nice little view, I'm weighing out some trucks right now so I am, oh geez

22
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,560
I can't even.

23
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,520
What does that mean for everyone, for 99% of people I have no idea what that means.

24
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,560
So I'm weighing these trucks into this scale house, this is my guy, I gotta hop out, weigh

25
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,400
him in and then I gotta weigh him out.

26
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,440
This guy, you know what's funny dude, this guy drove clear to Mesquite and he forgot

27
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:57,160
to get a weigh ticket and then he had to drive back.

28
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:02,200
Okay you let that guy wait five minutes then, let's do a quick intro then I'll take care.

29
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:08,760
We got Mr. Moin Gollum, what's up bro, Laura Shepard, you got a few people on, guys in

30
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:12,120
this video, this little live that me and Porter are gonna do, Porter can you just be on for

31
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,120
like five minutes?

32
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,120
Yeah here we go.

33
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:21,920
Okay, in this video what I wanna do is I actually just wanna go over, like just, first of all

34
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:28,480
I wanna explain to you how much money you can actually make from renting a simple website.

35
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,920
And if you don't know what I'm talking about with renting a simple website, I'm gonna

36
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,560
explain that here in a second.

37
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,680
And I'm not just gonna tell you, I'm gonna show you my Stripe account, I'm gonna show

38
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,360
you some screenshots of some of my clients and like I'm actually gonna show you a list

39
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,040
of like part of my clients.

40
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,120
The reason being is because a lot of people that have seen these videos that Porter and

41
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,520
I have done in the past, I think you see these videos and it's like, yeah it sounds

42
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:56,360
like it's awesome but it kind of feels too good to be true.

43
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,800
Would you say that that's, did you feel like that when you found out like I was doing this

44
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,000
or what was your thoughts?

45
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,160
Because I know that if I was from the outside looking in and somebody's like, yeah you can

46
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,760
travel the world and do all this stuff and pay your bills renting out simple websites,

47
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,240
I would probably be like, eh, I'm not sure I believe that.

48
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,920
It seems like it's just like you want to believe that but at the same time you're like, can

49
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,920
I do that?

50
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,120
Like it doesn't seem like you're qualified enough to be able to make that kind of money.

51
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,280
But did you think that it was actually real or did you think it was just like me making

52
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,840
some fake screenshots on Stripe because I think that people actually do think that is

53
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,840
the reality.

54
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,200
I actually want to show you guys some screenshots of some clients that I have and that I've

55
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,360
been working with for years.

56
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:45,720
So anyway, I guess you probably didn't have that thought because you would assume I wouldn't

57
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,720
lie to you.

58
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,720
Yeah.

59
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,720
I mean, I had a lot more.

60
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,720
I had a lot more faith.

61
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,720
Yeah.

62
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,720
Okay.

63
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,000
Well, anyway, so let's just do this really quick, dude.

64
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,320
I want to just tell my story quickly, just catch people up, just literally 15 seconds.

65
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,320
You the same.

66
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,840
We'll tell people the model and then I'll let you hop off.

67
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:06,360
So I do see Jerry, let's see, we've got Laura Shepard on there, Richard Martez, what's up?

68
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,360
Jerry Ward.

69
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,360
Good to see you, bro.

70
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,360
We need to catch up by the way.

71
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,240
We need to catch up when I was out of the country.

72
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,240
Jimmy Carlson.

73
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,240
Okay.

74
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:18,400
So in a nutshell, guys, I used to do door to door sales.

75
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,480
That was like the only job, the only real job I had.

76
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,480
It wasn't even on payroll.

77
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,580
It was knocking door to door.

78
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:32,000
I realized that if I wanted to make real money, and again, that real money is defined by different

79
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,800
people, but money where I would say seven figures plus, I needed to do something where

80
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,480
I actually owned the thing.

81
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,720
I couldn't be a salesperson.

82
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,480
I couldn't be an employee.

83
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,680
And so I'm like, I knew I needed to start a business.

84
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,680
Didn't know what to do.

85
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,680
Didn't know what to do.

86
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,680
Didn't know what to do.

87
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,680
I was asking everybody.

88
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,680
I was taking people to lunch.

89
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,680
All that.

90
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,680
Just being that annoying guy.

91
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,680
Like, hey, what should I do?

92
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,680
What should I do?

93
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,680
I don't know.

94
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,680
And I was making decent money doing door to door sales.

95
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,680
So I came across this business model.

96
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,760
Somebody introduced me to this specific podcast and said, hey, you should check this out.

97
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:07,000
Looked it up and it was talking about this idea where what you do is you pick a city,

98
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
you pick a niche.

99
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:13,640
So for example, Para One Tree Service, you build a simple website and then you rank that

100
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,560
website on Google.

101
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,720
And from once it ranks, you're going to start getting phone calls.

102
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,280
You take those phone calls and you sell the phone calls.

103
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,160
So you're essentially a middleman.

104
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,360
You are you're like a lead broker, right?

105
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,360
So this is the model.

106
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,400
It made perfect sense to me because they explained like once you do this, it's it's passive.

107
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,140
You have these websites that are out on the Internet collecting phone calls and you're

108
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:39,180
selling the leads and you're not even involved.

109
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,140
It's passive business model.

110
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,980
So I was completely hooked.

111
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:48,500
Long story short, I got into this in 2016, been doing this nine years, made all the mistakes

112
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,500
in the book.

113
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,220
I've I've almost I almost quit doing it twice.

114
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:57,460
Got distracted, tried to start a software company that didn't work.

115
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:01,300
And then finally in 2020, I was like, you know what, Nick, you got to figure this out.

116
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,700
Like you got to start actually making some some good money from this.

117
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,700
This is the right model.

118
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,060
You just got to put your head down.

119
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:09,660
And we made some adjustments and we made some tweaks.

120
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,500
We figured out a few things that I didn't know how to do.

121
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,460
And everything changed.

122
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:18,340
And since 2020, been making seven figures, one hundred thousand plus per month since

123
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:22,380
2020. OK, Porter, tell everyone really quick how you how you got into it.

124
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:26,340
And then we'll get into just showing some examples and letting people see that this

125
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,380
is actually real. Perfect.

126
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:33,100
So two years ago, when I got back from Colorado, I reached out to Nick.

127
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,580
I just got married.

128
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,660
And it was just kind of that point in my life where I was like, dude, I got to start

129
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:40,940
making some more money, like rent's expensive, food's expensive.

130
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,180
I mean, just everything in general.

131
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,260
I just didn't realize what it took to, you know, live out on your own.

132
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:48,380
And so that's kind of when I actually drew an interest in what you did.

133
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,500
I was like, dude, what are you doing?

134
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,580
I remember we had a conversation and you told it to me.

135
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:55,740
And I was like, it almost like it didn't make sense because I was like, what?

136
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:58,460
Like, that's all you did. And it kind of just was like this joke.

137
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,460
I was like, are you serious? This is crazy.

138
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:03,020
And then anyways, started doing it myself.

139
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,500
And for a little bit, it was hard.

140
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,780
It was just like my confidence, getting my confidence there of like, can I actually

141
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,420
do this? I have zero sales experience.

142
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,460
I have zero tech skills.

143
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,540
Like, why should I be able to sell this?

144
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:15,340
And you had been through summer sales, doing all these things.

145
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:19,580
So like I knew I could do it and I knew that you were like capable of like,

146
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,900
obviously this was real.

147
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:24,580
But, you know, until I fully bought into it, that was kind of when I saw the results

148
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,980
and it just changed my life.

149
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,660
And just to just give an idea.

150
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:34,420
So Porter, what's your what are you making per month doing this right now?

151
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,500
Ten six right now, ten thousand six hundred.

152
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,740
Ten thousand six hundred bucks.

153
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,100
OK, so that's what Porter makes per month.

154
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,860
By the way, this is not Porter's full time thing.

155
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:45,780
As you can see, Porter is taking five minutes to jump on this call, but he's full

156
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,260
time taking over the family farm, doing that.

157
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,260
He likes to work with his hands.

158
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,700
This is just a side thing for him.

159
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:54,540
He does it during the winters and then he kind of maintains it during the summers

160
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,700
when he's working on the family farm.

161
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,940
So you don't have to do this full time.

162
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:01,940
I personally started doing this while I was doing door to door sales.

163
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:05,020
I've been doing this full time, though, for, you know, five, six, seven years.

164
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,620
But you don't have to do this full time.

165
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:09,700
OK, so what I'm going to do is this.

166
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,580
Porter's making ten thousand six hundred bucks.

167
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:18,340
Again, I wanted him to be out here to tell you that just because it sounds like

168
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:22,580
when you think about the idea of building a simple website, it sound

169
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:25,220
and then renting it out, it sounds like you're full of crap.

170
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,380
That's that's the reality.

171
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,060
And I understand that.

172
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:30,180
So I'm going to be showing you a couple of examples on this call.

173
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,340
I'm going to show you some screenshots.

174
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,660
I know Porter's got to go here in a second.

175
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:36,460
But just so you guys understand how this works is once you rank one of these websites.

176
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,500
So let me just show one site, Porter, that you can bounce.

177
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,540
OK, no, you're good.

178
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:42,980
OK, let me show you guys this real quick.

179
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,140
I'm going to share my screen.

180
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,260
Hang on one second.

181
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:51,340
I'm going to go to a good old Google dot com, and then I'm going to share my screen.

182
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:54,420
I'm going to show everyone that has no idea what we're talking about, what this is.

183
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,020
OK, you can see my screen.

184
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:57,980
Yep, I can see it.

185
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,780
So here's how simple the model is.

186
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:02,460
Somebody goes to Google, they're in St.

187
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:05,260
George, Utah. They're looking for concrete, right?

188
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,180
They want a new patio.

189
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,380
They want a basketball court.

190
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:11,260
They want to extend their pool deck, whatever.

191
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,540
They want to put in a sidewalk.

192
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,500
They're going to go and they're probably going to go and type in concrete St.

193
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,100
George. Pretty simple.

194
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,340
St. George, concrete, concrete, St.

195
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,580
George, concrete company.

196
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:23,580
And what's going to happen is when you type this in, you're going to see these.

197
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,060
These at the top are sponsored ads.

198
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,900
OK, but if you go down here just a little bit, you're going to see these three

199
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,660
listings here and then you're going to see underneath, you're going to have some

200
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:35,740
more listings. OK, so if you see, I'm going to show you guys where I'm actually

201
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:39,260
ranking and how much money I'm making from this, and it's going to surprise you.

202
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,620
So if you can see this, this isn't my website.

203
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,580
This isn't my website. This is actually my website.

204
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,820
I'm ranked number three.

205
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,060
I'm not even ranked number one.

206
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:48,460
I'm also not ranked in the top three here.

207
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,340
If you change this, sometimes it will change it.

208
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,580
If you type in concrete St.

209
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,100
George or St.

210
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,860
George, concrete, sometimes if you switch it around.

211
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,180
So now I'm number two.

212
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,500
So it kind of depends.

213
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,300
But I want you to understand, I'm not the first listing.

214
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,340
OK, if you click on this site, somebody's in St.

215
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,780
George are looking for concrete.

216
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,540
They're going to come to this little website.

217
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,420
Nothing pretty, nothing fancy.

218
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:12,060
And if they call this phone number right here, I get paid.

219
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,260
OK, this is tracked.

220
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,220
It goes directly to the business owner.

221
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,380
The phone rings. I get paid.

222
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,540
If they fill this thing out right here.

223
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,380
Hey, I want to get an estimate, blah, blah, blah.

224
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,300
I get paid.

225
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,140
And that's it. That's it.

226
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,020
That's the whole model.

227
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:30,340
Build a site, rank it on Google for things that people search.

228
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,940
When people call the phone number, you get paid.

229
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,740
Is there anything else I could explain

230
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,860
that makes that even more simple?

231
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,820
No, it's literally digital real estate.

232
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,740
If you had an actual tenant in a rental house,

233
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:44,100
that's the easiest way for me to explain it is like it's

234
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,580
someone's renting the site from you every single month.

235
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,460
So before Porter goes, let me show you guys.

236
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,540
I just pulled this up on my this is my Stripe account.

237
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,540
Literally pulled this up today.

238
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,900
You can see right here, February.

239
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,540
What is the date today?

240
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:56,380
Nineteenth.

241
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,100
Yeah, this is literally I do that.

242
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,780
I screenshot this right before I jumped on.

243
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:04,580
OK, so this one website that I just really showed you guys,

244
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,780
you can see right here, I have made from this one singular

245
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:10,820
client, I have made sixty four thousand one hundred and

246
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,140
twenty five dollars.

247
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:15,900
OK, I signed the client in November of twenty twenty one.

248
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,060
Looks like we might have either had a pause

249
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,580
or they missed a few payments right here.

250
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:22,460
You could see my graph over here, my monthly revenue with them.

251
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,700
They pay me one thousand six hundred and thirty dollars

252
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,540
and fifty eight cents.

253
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:29,340
It looks like I had to give one refund, which probably was we

254
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,060
accidentally charged them twice.

255
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:34,980
And you could see every single week I get paid three hundred

256
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:35,900
and seventy five bucks.

257
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,300
Boom, boom, boom.

258
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,740
OK, let me see if I can go back to the site.

259
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,180
Here's the site.

260
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,220
So this little guy right here, St.

261
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:48,260
George Concrete CEO dot com, in all of its glory, is ripping

262
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:53,740
down one thousand six hundred and thirty dollars and fifty

263
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,140
eight cents per month.

264
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,540
Three hundred seventy five dollars a week.

265
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:59,540
I don't know about you, but that could almost cover a house

266
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,460
payment, depending on which part of the country.

267
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,100
And maybe not anymore.

268
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,380
Maybe that's like half a house payment now.

269
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:06,260
But you get two sites, you get your house paid for your

270
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,220
mortgage paid for.

271
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,700
So this is what we do.

272
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,460
So this is one of my sites I have.

273
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,780
So I'll show one more screenshot, then I'll show a

274
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:12,420
couple more examples.

275
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:15,180
But Porter, let me just show you this, dude, or I guess

276
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,300
everybody in here.

277
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,060
Here's a well, actually, I'll let you go, dude.

278
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:18,860
Do you have anything you want to add?

279
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:22,820
I know you got to go and do your real job, but it's good to

280
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:25,180
see that you can like Porter does this.

281
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,300
He has leads coming in.

282
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:29,060
He's trying to get his clothes and deals working with new

283
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,980
business owners while he's working on the farm.

284
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,900
And he's been able to scale this to ten thousand six

285
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,700
hundred dollars per month in addition to what he's doing on

286
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,740
the farm, which I think is amazing.

287
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,500
Anything you want to add?

288
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,060
No pressure.

289
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,340
But if you do.

290
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,220
No, I would just say anyone can do this.

291
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,820
I used to think that I had to be sitting at a desk and I had

292
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:48,100
all this free time to be able to make this work.

293
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,740
But seriously, you can do this anywhere.

294
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,300
Like you don't need to be sitting at a desk.

295
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,460
Like I feel like I almost get more done.

296
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:57,340
Like I'm just doing my everyday life and I'm continually

297
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:59,580
sitting over leads, hooking business owners, getting on the

298
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,220
phone and stuff like that.

299
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:03,420
So anyone could do this and you don't need sales experience.

300
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,420
That's like the biggest thing.

301
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,780
I think a lot of people are like, I'm afraid to get on the

302
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,340
phone. I've never done summer sales.

303
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:11,020
Like I'm fresh out of high school, whatever it is.

304
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,380
And it's like, dude, you don't just be yourself.

305
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:16,620
There are certain people that you're going to be able to

306
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,620
connect with that maybe I'm not going to be able to connect

307
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,100
with. So anyways.

308
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,700
Yeah. And just so everybody knows, when I first started

309
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,460
doing this, I had zero experience with the computer.

310
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,620
I didn't know how to build a website.

311
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,620
I didn't know what SEO meant, which means search engine

312
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:31,300
optimization. I didn't know what a domain was.

313
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:34,420
I knew how to work on the farm and knock doors.

314
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,740
That's it. That's all I knew how to do.

315
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,860
I didn't know how to do sales.

316
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,740
Well, actually, that's not true.

317
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,900
I had done door-to-door sales.

318
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,180
When I started doing door-to-door sales, I didn't know

319
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:42,540
how to do sales.

320
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,540
I knew how to do sales.

321
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,300
I did not know how to do anything technical.

322
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,980
Porter didn't know how to do anything technical.

323
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,660
And he also didn't have any sales experience.

324
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,580
So yeah, I double whammy.

325
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,460
But the cool part is we've actually seen some of our

326
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,220
friends, some of the kids that we went to high school with,

327
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:58,060
like even in the last week, we've seen not a lot,

328
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:02,500
but a handful of people that have kind of been watching for

329
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,020
years. And they're finally like, dude,

330
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,700
I should have done this two years ago instead of being out

331
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,700
there in the cold and under the sun,

332
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,100
actually doing manual labor,

333
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,860
which there's a hundred percent nothing wrong with that

334
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,860
actually feels really good to do manual labor.

335
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:19,260
But this allows you to do, to travel, to be wherever,

336
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:19,980
to be farming.

337
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:20,980
I like to travel.

338
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,140
I'm in Africa a lot and you can do this from anywhere.

339
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,820
So Porter, I'm going to show a couple more examples,

340
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:28,580
but you can hop off and go take care of the truck that's

341
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,740
waiting on you, bro.

342
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:30,580
Okay. Appreciate it.

343
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,420
See ya.

344
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,620
So guys, I'm just going to show you a couple more examples of

345
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,220
some sites that I've done this with.

346
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,780
And then I'm going to hop off.

347
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:38,620
That's it.

348
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,060
So here's another example.

349
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,580
If you type in, I'll give you one more St. George one.

350
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:45,180
If you type in St. George epoxy.

351
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,140
So, you know, when you go into your garage and you have like

352
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,660
an epoxy floor where, I mean,

353
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,180
I didn't even really know what this was growing up,

354
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,140
but then you moved to St. George.

355
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:52,980
I moved to St. George.

356
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:53,900
A lot of people had it.

357
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,740
So I'll show you the images here.

358
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,100
So this is like an epoxy garage floor right here.

359
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,900
It makes the garage super nice, super clean,

360
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,180
super easy to clean up.

361
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,900
So if you type in St. George epoxy,

362
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,740
you're going to see me right here at the very top.

363
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,340
Again, these are sponsored ads.

364
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,500
So this means they're paying for this.

365
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,740
So I'm actually the number one person here.

366
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:14,420
This is my website, stgeorgeopoxy.com.

367
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,260
This is my phone number.

368
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,940
If you call this phone number, I get paid.

369
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,460
Okay. And when I say I get paid,

370
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:21,340
what I mean by that is my business owners I work with,

371
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,980
they pay me a certain amount every single month

372
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,540
for all the phone calls.

373
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,900
You can do different structures where you can have it set up

374
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,580
where every time the phone rings,

375
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,900
they pay you a certain amount.

376
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:31,940
I don't like to do it that way

377
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,900
because it's a lot of tracking

378
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,140
and there's a lot of back and forth.

379
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,860
I like to just do a flat fee, make it easy.

380
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,140
I'm the business owner, make it easy on me.

381
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:40,380
But just for the sake of teaching you guys

382
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,980
and showing you guys what the heck it is I do,

383
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,820
if this phone rings, that's how I get paid.

384
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,060
Okay. So let me show you how much money I've made

385
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:49,140
from this website right here.

386
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,180
Let me see if I can pull up my screenshot.

387
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,620
Let's see here.

388
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,420
Hang tight.

389
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,300
I think it might be this one.

390
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,260
There it is.

391
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,100
Okay.

392
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,460
Nope. That's another one I'm going to show you.

393
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,540
Let me go to this one.

394
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,460
Okay. So this one right here,

395
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:09,580
once again, guys, see if you can see this.

396
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,660
I don't know if you can see me.

397
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,140
I can't see myself, hold on.

398
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,820
I'm not sharing my screen anymore.

399
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:17,860
Sorry, guys.

400
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:18,780
I didn't even show you that last one.

401
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:21,180
This is the website I was showing you guys, sorry.

402
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,740
If you type in St. George Epoxy on Google,

403
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,180
you're going to go, you're going to see my website

404
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:28,020
here at the top, stgeorgeepoxy.com.

405
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,060
You can see it's super simple.

406
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:30,900
That's it.

407
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,900
If you call this phone number right here, I get paid.

408
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:33,740
That's what I was trying to say.

409
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:34,780
So I thought I was sharing my screen

410
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:35,620
when I was showing you this.

411
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,620
That's another one of my websites.

412
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:40,340
Here's how much I've made from that website.

413
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,740
So you can see right here, St. George Epoxy leads.

414
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,260
Let's see.

415
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,100
You can see right here.

416
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,260
It doesn't really show the date,

417
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,300
but I just screenshot this right before I came on.

418
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,100
You can see right here, it shows all the way till February.

419
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,540
I don't see anywhere that it shows the actual date.

420
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,140
This one's a little bit lower.

421
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,660
I make $652.23.

422
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:00,060
Why? Because the jobs aren't worth as much money.

423
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,660
And so I don't get paid as much.

424
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,700
So it's not my favorite niche.

425
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,140
I'd rather go into concrete, but I do have this one.

426
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:08,300
This guy has been paying me since June of 2020,

427
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:11,740
and I've made $36,350.

428
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,820
I get paid 150 bucks a week.

429
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:15,980
Again, 150 bucks isn't gonna make you rich,

430
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:18,420
but you do that 100 times,

431
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:21,620
and you're gonna have some nice money coming in.

432
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,620
One thing that's cool about this deal that I did,

433
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:28,500
I actually, including on top of the money that they paid me,

434
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,540
we actually worked out a deal where this guy did my garage,

435
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:35,740
and I actually got my garage completely blacked out,

436
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,980
and it looks really, really cool.

437
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,580
So he did that at cost.

438
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,420
I paid for the material.

439
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,420
He actually did the labor.

440
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,140
Okay, let me show you one more website,

441
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,780
and then I'll hop off here.

442
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:46,660
There's one more deal.

443
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:49,180
This is another one I did a couple years ago.

444
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:50,020
Let's see.

445
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,780
Type in Bentonville Concrete.

446
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,660
You're gonna see me here at the top.

447
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,180
You're also gonna see me here.

448
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:00,820
You're gonna see me that I'm ranked a couple times

449
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,260
on page one, depending on the search term,

450
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,340
but I'm right here at the top.

451
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,020
You click on this.

452
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,980
Another one of my little dinky websites.

453
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,180
Guys, these are not special.

454
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,260
I don't know how to code.

455
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,380
I don't know how to use WordPress.

456
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,340
This is literally built on weebly.com.

457
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,540
This website right here, as soon as you call this,

458
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,020
it goes to my business owner.

459
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,420
It tracks it for me,

460
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,220
and then I send him an invoice every month

461
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,100
and run his credit card.

462
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:21,980
That's it, okay?

463
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:24,540
This one, this specific website,

464
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:28,660
I have made, let me show you here.

465
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:30,620
Right here.

466
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:34,340
I have made $52,725.

467
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,060
Now, you see this pass due.

468
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:38,980
This just means we ran this person's card today,

469
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,300
and it didn't go through.

470
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:45,060
Maybe he's over the limit or changed cards or whatever,

471
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:47,740
but what will happen is in two, three days,

472
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,940
we'll hit the card again and it'll run.

473
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:53,420
So you can see right here, I get paid $978.34

474
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,580
every single month.

475
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,460
It's 225 bucks a week.

476
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:59,100
I've been working with him since June of 2020.

477
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,700
Ironically, I've actually been working with him longer.

478
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,180
I think I was even working with him the year before,

479
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,260
or six months before that,

480
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:08,580
but we were running it under a different Stripe account.

481
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,580
But over that course of time,

482
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:13,900
I've made $52,725.

483
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,860
You can see right here, we started in this account

484
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:16,820
on June 4th.

485
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:23,100
$52,725 from this, okay?

486
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,860
This is not fancy.

487
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,180
This is not hard to build.

488
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:31,820
This website took me probably a week to build,

489
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:32,820
weeks worth of hours,

490
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:36,060
so probably 40 to 50 hours worth of time I put into this,

491
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,660
and it's paid me $52,000.

492
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,060
Now, granted, I had to go get the client,

493
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,260
I had to put the deal together.

494
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:43,780
I do keep the relationship with the client,

495
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:46,260
but this is, I mean, consider if you knew

496
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,700
you could go spend 50 hours and build something

497
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,940
that was gonna make you $52,000 over the next four years,

498
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,380
wouldn't you do that 100 times?

499
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,660
That's what I've been doing

500
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,380
for the past three, four, five years,

501
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,780
and I've just been stacking these sites,

502
00:19:58,780 --> 00:19:59,860
stacking these sites.

503
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:04,860
150 bucks a week here, 350 here, 500 there, 100 here,

504
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,020
and these things just continually add up

505
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:11,580
until you start making quite a bit of money, okay?

506
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,380
So last thing I wanna show you guys really quick,

507
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,220
just for fun, I'll show you a little sample list

508
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,260
of some of my clients here.

509
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,660
I'm not gonna show you their names, obviously,

510
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:22,900
but I took this screenshot and just blurred out the names.

511
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,620
Just to show you, this is my Stripe account,

512
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:28,700
did this today, right here, date as of February 18th,

513
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,220
so I guess that's as of yesterday, maybe.

514
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,180
But anyway, you can see right here,

515
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:35,380
here's my list of clients I'm obviously not gonna show you,

516
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:39,700
but I've got somebody that's paid me over 132,000.

517
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:45,700
This one's paid me 64, 57, 54, 52, 47, 46, 36, 35,

518
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,740
33, 32, 29, 29.

519
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:51,540
This is not all my clients, this is one page of my clients.

520
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,860
You can see right here, these things stack up,

521
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:56,380
24, 26, 27, 28, all the way up to 132.

522
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,340
And yes, sometimes we have clients

523
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,700
that you start working with,

524
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,900
and then after three to six months, it doesn't work out.

525
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,340
And you go and you part ways and then you take your website.

526
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,340
But here's the beautiful thing, guys,

527
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:08,660
is when does it work out with the client, right?

528
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,500
So let's say that this specific client

529
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,860
that I'm dealing with here,

530
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,100
let's say this guy calls me and he's like,

531
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,540
hey, I don't wanna buy these leads anymore,

532
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,460
I'm doing something else, I don't have any money,

533
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:17,940
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

534
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:21,260
Okay, it's not a big deal because I'm just gonna take

535
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:24,380
this website, I'm gonna go to my software,

536
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:27,500
which is, we use this thing called rankandrentengine.com,

537
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,260
and I'm gonna change the phone number

538
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:31,140
so that when people call this phone number,

539
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,860
it goes to my new business owner.

540
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:35,620
I'll change it so he's paying me instead of the old guy.

541
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:39,460
No damage done, it's just like owning properties, right?

542
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,740
If you own a house, you put a tenant in it,

543
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:42,700
they pay you every month.

544
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,420
If you have to evict that tenant, guess what?

545
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,260
You put somebody else in, they pay you.

546
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:49,340
That's it, that's the whole game.

547
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:54,100
Think about this like building houses all over the internet,

548
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,380
but instead of houses, they're websites.

549
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:58,540
You're building these miniature passive income streams

550
00:21:58,540 --> 00:21:59,580
all over the internet.

551
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:02,300
The way that I look at it is I have, I don't know,

552
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,700
35 to 50 of these websites, I don't know the exact number

553
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,660
that are rented out versus how many we have,

554
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:09,700
but every single day, while we're talking right now,

555
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,860
these websites are out there collecting phone calls.

556
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,340
When I'm sleeping, when I'm golfing,

557
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,500
when I'm traveling to Africa,

558
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,180
when I'm doing my team meeting,

559
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:19,260
which I'm about to do here in one minute,

560
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,020
I'm making money from these websites.

561
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:23,380
It's like, I always think about it like this show,

562
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:26,020
Despicable Me, and Gru has the minions, right?

563
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,900
And they're literally just working,

564
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,740
and they're just doing stuff for them.

565
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:31,620
I don't think, if I remember the show right,

566
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,460
they have to eat.

567
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,460
The one thing with these minions is they do have

568
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,860
like personalities and feelings.

569
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:38,540
These don't have feelings, these don't have personalities,

570
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:41,060
these don't need time off, these don't need vacations,

571
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,820
these don't need compliments, and you tell them

572
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,740
that they're doing a good job, they just go to work for you.

573
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:50,380
You build them, you rank them, you set them free,

574
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,980
and they go and they collect dollars for you

575
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:54,580
all over the internet while you do what you love to do.

576
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:58,500
So, anyway, for anyone that might have been curious,

577
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,500
maybe you weren't curious at all,

578
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,100
maybe you just think it's annoying that I keep posting this,

579
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,340
I'm sorry, you can unfollow me.

580
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:06,180
I use these social medias for business,

581
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,700
social media channels for business,

582
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,220
but for those of you that are curious, interested,

583
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:12,220
whatever, this is how it works.

584
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,100
You build these sites, you rank them,

585
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,500
you rent them out to local business owners,

586
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,780
you get paid, you do it again, you do it again,

587
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:18,620
you do it again.

588
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:20,220
You spend your life doing what you love to do

589
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,780
instead of working for somebody else, okay?

590
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:22,620
That's the whole game.

591
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:25,020
So, that said, the only thing I'll do really quick,

592
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:27,260
I have a couple of, if you guys are interested,

593
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,500
I have a free training,

594
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:32,140
because people are like, how do you learn more,

595
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,620
rentsimplesites.com.

596
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:36,860
Give me one second.

597
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:42,580
Rentsimplesites.com, that's a free training.

598
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,260
And then we also have a community,

599
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:53,260
which is, if you go to rankandretire.com.

600
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:58,140
Again, no pressure, these are just some resources.

601
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,740
And then I'm actually gonna do this.

602
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:02,340
I talked to Porter, I have a deal with him,

603
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,820
anybody that he does this with,

604
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:05,500
I actually make sure he's taken care of,

605
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,940
but I'm gonna drop Porter's number.

606
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,540
If you guys have any questions,

607
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:13,900
you can literally text Porter, this is his own cell phone,

608
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:18,180
you can text Porter, and he will text you back,

609
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,180
or hop on a call with you,

610
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,820
and just kinda walk you through it.

611
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:23,700
So, anyway, if you guys are curious, there you go.

612
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,500
If not, no big deal, thanks for being on the live.

613
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,260
I'm gonna jump onto a team meeting.

614
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,940
Happy February, stay warm,

615
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,740
see you guys on the next one, I'm out.
