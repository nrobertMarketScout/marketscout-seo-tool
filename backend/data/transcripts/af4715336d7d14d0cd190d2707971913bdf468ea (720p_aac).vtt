WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.840
Okay, we should be live.

00:08.840 --> 00:12.000
Or getting ready to be live.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
Awesome.

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
All right.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
Okay, we should be live.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
I think we're live.

00:21.000 --> 00:30.000
Let's check it out.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.000
Cool.

00:31.000 --> 00:39.000
We are here.

00:39.000 --> 00:44.000
All right. Hey guys we're here we're live.

00:44.000 --> 00:52.000
Let's get this going.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
Okay.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
It should be good to be able to watch that.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.000
I'm going to start tagging everybody.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
Go from there. Can you still hear me here?

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
Yeah.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
Can you hear me?

01:07.000 --> 01:12.000
Yeah, I can hear you.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
Okay.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
Okay.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
Let's get everybody.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
So we're going to tag everybody and let people kind of pop on

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
here.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.000
And we'll wait till we have three or four people.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
Sometimes you only have five or six people, but.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
We'll just see what we get today.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
Yeah.

01:29.000 --> 01:41.000
Then we get started once people start popping on.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
Okay.

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
I think we're good to go.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
Okay.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
So,

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
I don't know if you've ever done one of these,

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
but if you watch both,

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
there's a huge delay between what you and I are doing and then what

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
people.

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
See or respond with on Facebook. So it's kind of a trip for me.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
Sometimes.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
So.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
Yeah.

01:59.000 --> 02:04.000
Yeah.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
If I seem like I'm saying something that was like something you and I

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
talked about like five, 10 seconds ago, it's because.

02:08.000 --> 02:30.000
Okay.

02:30.000 --> 02:37.000
All right. We've got a few people coming on.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
We're going to be, um,

02:39.000 --> 02:43.000
kind of helping you guys out and getting a jumpstart on transferring

02:43.000 --> 02:45.000
and, uh, we're not transferring, but, uh,

02:45.000 --> 02:48.000
Setting up search campaigns like we've talked about.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
Um,

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
So that's kind of going to be what we're doing today.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
Um,

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
we'll let a few more people get on board here and we'll get started.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
Obviously this video will stay on Facebook.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
So there shouldn't be a problem with that.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
Um,

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
Everyone will be able to get it.

03:04.000 --> 03:09.000
We're trying to set up a simple search campaign for you guys

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
to be able to use on your one pagers.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
And we're going to try to make it.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Um,

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
As kind of fast and simple as we can.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
We're probably not going to, uh,

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
dive deep into a lot of the explanations.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
We're just going to kind of show you how to do it.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
So you could do it on some of yours.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
Um,

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
And we'll take a few questions as we go.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
But the goal is to kind of have this up and running.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
Um,

03:35.000 --> 03:38.000
let it sit there on the Facebook group and then you guys can kind of

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
jump in and take a look at it.

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
Uh, right now we, we've done some longer formatted ones, um,

03:44.000 --> 03:48.000
that are being edited and kind of chopped up to make it a little,

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
uh,

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
easier to digest.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
And then what we'll do is as these things roll out and we get more

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
questions and stuff,

03:54.000 --> 03:57.000
we'll see where we need to explain more and stuff like that.

03:58.000 --> 04:02.000
So we'll probably do like a more polished, uh,

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
version of everything at some point. Um,

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
but we want to get you guys going on with stuff and at least give you

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
something to work with. And then we'll just keep,

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
we'll just keep polishing it up, making it easier for you guys. So,

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
uh, all right. Well, with that, um,

04:16.000 --> 04:20.000
we'll let our special guests come on. Francesca, are you there?

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
Yes.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
I don't know how special, but I'm here.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
All right. And for those that don't know, Francesca is, uh,

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
why don't you go ahead and introduce yourself and, uh,

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
credential speak for yourself.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
Yeah. So I've been working with Nick for,

04:38.000 --> 04:43.000
I'm going to my fifth year and I'm running like the agency side for

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
him pretty much.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
I'm sure some people have talked to me on the application as well.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
So when they first applied,

04:51.000 --> 04:56.000
I'm the one that answers those as well for anyone that,

04:56.000 --> 05:00.000
you know, has joined since, um, April, I would say.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
Some people shouldn't know me or at least I've heard my voice.

05:07.000 --> 05:12.000
Okay. Good. Good. Um, so anyway, so just for you guys, um,

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
so Francesca kind of runs, uh,

05:15.000 --> 05:19.000
most of Nick's ads and stuff like that, like she said, she's kind of the, uh,

05:19.000 --> 05:23.000
she's the one who makes sure that place runs and keeps going. Um,

05:23.000 --> 05:27.000
so we've been working together for probably like the last five, six months.

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
And, uh, we've been testing a lot of stuff, seeing what works,

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
what's not working.

05:31.000 --> 05:35.000
And so that's what we're doing today is to try to show you guys some,

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
um, simple search campaigns. So with that,

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
we've about seven people on we're going to go ahead and start rolling.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
And we're going to see how well this goes. So,

05:47.000 --> 05:51.000
so bear with us. And, um, we, to save some time,

05:51.000 --> 05:54.000
we've preloaded a few things. Um, I'm just going to touch on them.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
They're pretty simple things that I preloaded.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
It's just so you guys don't have to watch me typing and things like that.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
So it's just to save a little bit of time on your end.

06:01.000 --> 06:05.000
So you don't have to watch typing and things like that. Okay.

06:06.000 --> 06:10.000
Um, like that reminds me before we get started here,

06:11.000 --> 06:14.000
I forgot I got to live this up to give me one second, guys.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
I just want to get this going here.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
Okay.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
Sorry. I forgot to bring up the keyword planner.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
All right.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
Yeah.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
So.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
Yeah.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
Let me just, let me just plug this in real quick.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
Okay.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
And I'm going to show you guys what I'm working on. I've just, uh,

06:38.000 --> 06:42.000
like I said, we're just trying to save some time and I'm just going to show

06:42.000 --> 06:46.000
you how to, how we do some things and just have to set some certain stuff

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
up.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
Okay.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.000
Okay.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
I think we're ready to go here.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
All right. Cool.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
All right.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
So I'm just going to show you how to save some time.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
Okay.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
Okay.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
I think we're ready to go here.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
All right.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Cool.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
All right, everybody.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
So we're going to go ahead and get started here.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
Let me go ahead and share my screen.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
I think away we go.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
All right.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
Oh yeah.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
You see everything now.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
Okay.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
All right.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.000
So here we go, guys.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
We are going to hop in and, um,

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
Set up a search campaign today for you guys.

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
Um, there's two different types of main search campaigns.

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
Um, there's one called, uh, like a call only, like a call ad.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
And then there's the standard, like webs, uh,

07:44.000 --> 07:48.000
website traffic or like a, like a click to call ad where somebody clicks on

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
your website and then they click over.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
Um, and do that. So we're going to, um,

07:53.000 --> 07:57.000
we're going to set up a call only ad because that's a more simple one to

07:57.000 --> 08:01.000
set up. It's very similar as you guys will see in more training,

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
but it's a, it's an easy one to set up.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
Um, and it gets the phone ringing fairly fast.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
So that's what we're going to show you guys today.

08:08.000 --> 08:13.000
Um, with that, I'm going to, I'm going to get on my phone real quick.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.000
Uh, or Francesca, can you see the Facebook group on your end?

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Are you able to monitor that?

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
I am not on Facebook. Let me, let me go in real quick.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
Okay. That way, if you see some comments come up or something since.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
Yeah.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
Okay.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
If you see any comments, just let me know.

08:28.000 --> 08:33.000
Okay. So guys, so what we're doing, so we're in the, uh, MCC account here.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
Uh, we went up and we set up, you guys,

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
this is all the same as the trainings we went and we set up a new sub

08:38.000 --> 08:39.000
account.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
Um, so we're setting up, uh,

08:40.000 --> 08:44.000
this is a client that reached out to you guys.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
You guys didn't do a prospecting for it.

08:46.000 --> 08:50.000
This is an inbound person that came to, uh, Nick's, uh,

08:50.000 --> 08:55.000
agency and wants them to help them get leads for duck cleaning in the

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
New Orleans, uh, area, um, in region.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
So we're going to set up that campaign today for you guys.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
And you guys get to kind of watch how this is going to go.

09:04.000 --> 09:09.000
So what we did is we set up the sub account and we go to,

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
we click on that and now we're here in this screen.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.000
So that's the same as the training. You guys get to this spot.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
Now you want to set up a new campaign.

09:17.000 --> 09:22.000
So click on new campaign.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
Okay.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
Since we want to focus on a call only ad.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
Okay.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
We're going to use, take advantage of the leads.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
We're going to select leads.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
Call.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
And then we're going to click.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
Right here at search.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
Okay.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
We're going to do website visits.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
It's going to ask.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
For our.

09:45.000 --> 09:58.000
Our website.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
Um, do you know if the, uh, has it been HTTPS yet?

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
Does it have that SSL on it?

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
Yeah.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
Let me try that.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
Okay.

10:06.000 --> 10:10.000
And then we're going to go here.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
And it's going to give us these four different, um,

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
lead conversion goals.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
And we're going to click right here.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
Phone calls from your ads.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
And then I just like the name of this.

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
So we're just going to call this.

10:24.000 --> 10:28.000
No.

10:28.000 --> 10:34.000
Okay.

10:34.000 --> 10:38.000
I'm going to ask you, do you want to focus on conversions or clicks?

10:38.000 --> 10:39.000
Um,

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
You can, you can set up conversions if you want.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
I kind of like clicks right now.

10:43.000 --> 10:52.000
Um, but.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
It's not a huge issue one way or the other,

10:54.000 --> 10:57.000
but I prefer to do clicks may just be the way I was trained to do it or

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
whatever.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.000
Okay. And now what we want and something for search campaigns is we

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
can set.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
Um,

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
Um,

11:06.000 --> 11:11.000
The reason for this is like,

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
You don't want to get into a bidding war where you're doing like $30,

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
like keyword clicks or something like that.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
Okay.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
Okay.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
All right.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
Love you.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
Um,

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
And sorry.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
Yeah.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
And then,

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
so what we're going to do here is we're going to go here and we're going

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
to set a maximum cost per click.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
And you guys are going to ask me.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
Okay.

11:31.000 --> 11:36.000
So what I did is I took our top four keywords.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
Um, I went into keyword planner.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
So if you guys go to tools and setting.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
You, you hit keyword planner.

11:42.000 --> 11:46.000
Okay.

11:46.000 --> 11:51.000
And I paste it in our top four key keywords here.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
I set my location up for the new Orleans, uh, area.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
Okay. And it's given me.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
Um,

11:57.000 --> 12:01.000
And then it's given me the low range and the top, uh, high end range.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
Okay.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.000
And you can see here, there's a pretty good, I mean, look at this one.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.000
It's like a $15 difference between the low and the high end.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
And stuff like that.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
Uh, this one's, you know, from seven 50 to $24.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
So, um,

12:14.000 --> 12:17.000
they know that air duct cleaning is a very, uh,

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
expensive competitive niche now, especially like post COVID.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
Where people are more and more into it.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
Okay.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
Okay.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
Um, so.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
We're, um,

12:27.000 --> 12:33.000
We're we're looking at this.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
Um,

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
what we want to do is we want to be on the high end of our top of page

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
bid.

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
But because these are so, so, so, so high.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
Um,

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
we just got to try to figure out like a happy medium for right now.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
Okay. And we can always adjust it.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
But kind of looking at like, I'm seeing a lot of like.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
So we're looking at the top of the page bid.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
Okay.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
And I'm not going to go into the top of the page bid.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
I'm not going to look into the top of the page bid,

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
but it's definitely a high end.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
So I'll just go for $4.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
But I look on the low end and I'm seeing, you know,

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
seven, eight, nine, $10, stuff like that.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
So what we'll do is to kind of play it safe.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
What we'll do is we'll set something.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
That's a little under those really high ends,

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
but it's definitely way over the low end.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
So for right now, what we'll do is we'll choose 13.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
76.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
Okay.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
There's really no science behind that, but.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.000
We're going to.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
That's the maximum we're willing to do for a click. Okay.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.500
I'm just showing you guys how you set this up.

13:21.500 --> 13:24.540
Obviously, do we want to set up ads in New Orleans?

13:24.540 --> 13:25.500
Probably not, right?

13:25.500 --> 13:27.460
But this is a client that reached out to them

13:27.460 --> 13:30.360
that wants to do business, that's already paying them.

13:30.360 --> 13:31.860
Francesca and them know what they're doing.

13:31.860 --> 13:33.940
They already told them like, hey, it's an expensive area.

13:33.940 --> 13:35.060
It's going to do duh.

13:35.060 --> 13:36.580
Like they set up a big contract.

13:36.580 --> 13:40.980
They got enough room to play here in this space, okay?

13:40.980 --> 13:42.620
But for you guys, if you guys are seeing

13:42.620 --> 13:44.100
those big variations,

13:44.100 --> 13:45.540
you just kind of want to choose something,

13:45.560 --> 13:49.120
but you definitely don't want to be on this low end, okay?

13:49.120 --> 13:51.040
You want to be somewhere in the middle.

13:51.040 --> 13:55.400
If everything's equal and these are like $6, $7 higher,

13:55.400 --> 13:59.440
what I recommend then is doing one penny higher.

13:59.440 --> 14:01.820
That's my recommendation for that.

14:01.820 --> 14:03.980
Okay, enough of that.

14:03.980 --> 14:07.720
Okay, now we go here, we hit next, right?

14:07.720 --> 14:09.800
And this is where they're going to try to trick you again.

14:09.800 --> 14:13.280
But now we finally get to opt out of the display network.

14:13.300 --> 14:15.220
And then they hide Google search partners

14:15.220 --> 14:16.740
right here at search network.

14:16.740 --> 14:18.740
So I've done this sometimes where I think I'm good

14:18.740 --> 14:20.060
and I forget to uncheck this.

14:20.060 --> 14:22.040
So you want to uncheck these two right here

14:22.040 --> 14:24.580
because you only want to play on the search network now.

14:24.580 --> 14:26.280
I don't care about these other ones, right?

14:26.280 --> 14:29.260
We want to save, we want to get rid of those clicks, okay?

14:29.260 --> 14:31.980
Now it's going to ask you for a location.

14:31.980 --> 14:34.780
So we're going to say enter another location.

14:34.780 --> 14:38.860
Now this particular client has some particular locations.

14:38.860 --> 14:40.260
So what we're going to do

14:40.360 --> 14:43.480
is we're going to click advanced search, okay?

14:43.480 --> 14:47.080
And then what it's going to do is it's going to give us,

14:47.080 --> 14:49.440
because of the towns that they want to target,

14:49.440 --> 14:50.680
we've already kind of looked at this.

14:50.680 --> 14:53.280
So we're going to choose radius, okay?

14:53.280 --> 14:55.860
So we're going to do a radius.

14:55.860 --> 14:59.520
I'm going to do about five miles

14:59.520 --> 15:01.120
in between each of these cities.

15:01.120 --> 15:03.800
And we can always go back and adjust this later.

15:03.800 --> 15:07.160
So I'm looking for Gonzales, Louisiana.

15:08.100 --> 15:10.140
And I can bump this out to more.

15:11.660 --> 15:12.860
We're going to keep that at five.

15:12.860 --> 15:16.320
And we're just going to kind of see how this,

15:17.960 --> 15:19.460
how this works for us here.

15:38.100 --> 15:38.940
Okay.

15:40.820 --> 15:43.500
And again, we can go back later and adjust these,

15:43.500 --> 15:46.540
but just to kind of give you guys an idea

15:46.540 --> 15:49.940
of how we're setting this thing up a little bit in this area.

15:49.940 --> 15:52.300
And the reason why we're doing a radius

15:52.300 --> 15:56.620
and not like an exact city is because

15:57.700 --> 15:59.500
when you get on the outskirts of New Orleans,

15:59.500 --> 16:01.040
it's a little more rural,

16:01.040 --> 16:02.580
but obviously the city of New Orleans

16:02.580 --> 16:06.100
is going to be a lot more dense.

16:06.100 --> 16:08.440
So we're going to choose these here.

16:10.240 --> 16:12.960
And then, oh, it's all right.

16:12.960 --> 16:13.800
We got the one more.

16:13.800 --> 16:14.640
We got it.

16:28.640 --> 16:29.480
Hang on a second.

16:29.480 --> 16:31.880
I have to figure out the spelling of that one again.

16:32.880 --> 16:34.800
They'll chase, no wonder why it's not.

16:34.800 --> 16:35.640
I don't know.

16:35.640 --> 16:36.800
All right, let me see that.

16:40.000 --> 16:40.840
There it is.

16:41.880 --> 16:42.720
Okay.

16:42.720 --> 16:43.880
Now see how that kind of gets in here.

16:43.880 --> 16:47.880
Like we can reduce that one if we find that this is too dense,

16:47.880 --> 16:48.880
but we're going to leave it for now.

16:48.880 --> 16:50.640
So these are going to be our main locations

16:50.640 --> 16:52.880
that the customer wants to target.

16:52.880 --> 16:54.200
So they actually want to kind of target

16:54.200 --> 16:56.160
around New Orleans, which is good.

16:56.160 --> 16:58.680
Okay, so that's how we're setting that up.

16:58.680 --> 17:01.080
And then you want to click here where it says location.

17:01.080 --> 17:03.040
Click here where it says location options.

17:03.040 --> 17:06.240
The default is going to be presence or interest, okay?

17:06.240 --> 17:07.320
This is going to show you,

17:07.320 --> 17:09.000
this is going to be wasteful ad spend.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.400
So we want to make sure that we select people

17:11.400 --> 17:14.320
that are in or regularly in those targeted locations

17:14.320 --> 17:17.440
because that's where homeowners and business owners are.

17:17.440 --> 17:20.720
Not tourists, not people driving through, stuff like that.

17:20.720 --> 17:21.880
So we always want to check that.

17:21.880 --> 17:25.800
It just helps save for better click searches.

17:25.800 --> 17:27.480
English is our language.

17:28.400 --> 17:31.720
Audience segments, we don't need to really worry about

17:31.720 --> 17:32.840
for what we're doing.

17:33.960 --> 17:37.240
We want to go here and more settings.

17:37.240 --> 17:38.920
These are the default.

17:38.920 --> 17:41.760
So we can tweak some of these or we can leave them the same.

17:41.760 --> 17:46.760
I prefer to let Google best optimize whatever,

17:47.160 --> 17:48.600
like the best performing ads

17:48.600 --> 17:50.680
instead of me having to try to control it

17:50.680 --> 17:52.520
because it just takes too much time and maintenance

17:52.520 --> 17:53.480
and stuff like that.

17:53.480 --> 17:54.800
So the default is this.

17:54.800 --> 17:56.400
That's what we want to make sure.

17:56.400 --> 17:58.800
We're going to start today with no end date.

17:58.800 --> 18:01.440
You can do a different schedule.

18:01.440 --> 18:02.800
And because it's a call ad,

18:02.800 --> 18:04.360
we're going to set that up like that

18:04.360 --> 18:06.440
because we don't want calls coming in

18:06.440 --> 18:08.280
like super late at night, right?

18:08.280 --> 18:11.920
So we'll probably start it at like 7 a.m.

18:11.920 --> 18:13.920
and we'll run these till probably,

18:14.920 --> 18:16.840
it was almost 6.30, sorry.

18:16.840 --> 18:20.200
And we'll probably run these till like maybe like seven.

18:20.200 --> 18:22.040
That'd probably be a decent time.

18:22.040 --> 18:25.560
And then that's going to be that for there.

18:25.600 --> 18:28.120
You can see that there's obviously more settings.

18:28.120 --> 18:29.680
These things we're not worried about yet.

18:29.680 --> 18:30.880
So we go here.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.560
Okay, now it's going to want to run our ad group.

18:41.280 --> 18:44.920
It has right here, it gives us our website.

18:44.920 --> 18:48.240
Okay, now Google is going to try to give you

18:48.240 --> 18:49.880
a bunch of keywords in here.

18:49.880 --> 18:52.880
Okay, when there's nothing over here,

18:52.880 --> 18:55.200
these are considered broad match.

18:55.840 --> 18:58.840
So we're going to go ahead and type in the keywords.

18:58.840 --> 19:01.640
We're going to type in the quotes as a phrase match

19:01.640 --> 19:03.360
and the brackets are exact match.

19:03.360 --> 19:05.240
We only want to use phrase match for right now.

19:05.240 --> 19:08.720
So to speed things up, we took the keywords

19:08.720 --> 19:10.320
that Francesca gave us.

19:10.320 --> 19:13.000
We went to this website called AdWordsWrapper.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.960
Okay, I pasted my keywords in here.

19:15.960 --> 19:18.080
I told Google to wrap it.

19:18.080 --> 19:19.080
I'm going to go down here

19:19.080 --> 19:21.280
and you can see the different types of keywords,

19:21.280 --> 19:22.680
labels right here.

19:22.680 --> 19:25.000
I'm going to go to the phrase match one.

19:25.360 --> 19:26.760
Don't push the copy button

19:26.760 --> 19:29.000
because for some reason it doesn't copy it.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
I don't know why.

19:41.440 --> 19:43.960
I hate when the menu moves in front of you.

19:43.960 --> 19:45.160
Okay, hold on.

19:45.160 --> 19:46.320
Maybe a little maneuvering.

19:46.320 --> 19:47.720
Okay, there we go.

19:50.120 --> 19:51.960
Zoom thing was in my way.

19:51.960 --> 19:53.800
Okay, I'm going to copy all these.

19:53.800 --> 19:54.640
I'm going to delete.

19:54.640 --> 19:56.520
And then I'm going to paste my own.

19:56.520 --> 19:58.880
Okay, so this is from our own research.

19:58.880 --> 20:01.720
These are the ones I want to run phrase match on

20:01.720 --> 20:03.240
and we're going to go with that.

20:04.080 --> 20:07.000
Okay, now we're going to get into setting up our ad.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.960
Now, because this is a call only ad,

20:09.960 --> 20:11.960
we only get a couple of headlines

20:11.960 --> 20:13.400
and a couple of,

20:14.800 --> 20:16.200
oh look, it's going to give us more this time.

20:16.200 --> 20:17.040
Awesome.

20:17.040 --> 20:18.280
So we're just going to fill it out

20:18.280 --> 20:20.160
with like just a few basic ones

20:20.160 --> 20:22.280
and then just to save time here,

20:22.280 --> 20:25.680
but you can optimize it as much as it'll give you, okay?

20:27.200 --> 20:28.680
So we're going to go here.

20:29.800 --> 20:30.800
We have our website.

20:30.800 --> 20:35.280
You can kind of see that it kind of started auto-filling it,

20:35.280 --> 20:38.640
but we're going to stick to like what we're trained on, right?

20:38.640 --> 20:42.240
So, right, so what we're trained on is, right,

20:42.240 --> 20:44.120
city and service main keywords.

20:44.120 --> 20:48.120
So we're going to do New Orleans.

20:48.120 --> 20:49.720
We're going to see if I can get,

20:52.400 --> 20:55.600
let's see if I can get, oh, look at that, perfect.

20:55.600 --> 20:57.640
Okay, what's the next one?

20:57.640 --> 21:00.960
Get a hundred percent free, right?

21:00.960 --> 21:01.800
So,

21:12.160 --> 21:14.160
that'd be awesome, a hundred percent free.

21:15.320 --> 21:16.800
Can you just put estimate?

21:17.800 --> 21:20.360
Well, it's only for 30 characters, so.

21:21.360 --> 21:24.440
Yeah, just like get a hundred percent free estimate

21:24.440 --> 21:26.120
without the duck cleaning.

21:26.120 --> 21:28.360
Yeah, I think that's what we're going to have to do.

21:29.400 --> 21:32.000
I tried though, okay.

21:32.000 --> 21:32.840
Yeah, I know.

21:32.840 --> 21:33.680
Okay.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.440
Dryer vent cleaning.

21:55.600 --> 21:58.600
Let me see what I should just do this.

22:02.840 --> 22:03.680
Okay.

22:10.440 --> 22:14.280
Okay, so we're going to just do these four for now.

22:14.280 --> 22:17.040
We'll come back another time and we'll fill this out.

22:17.040 --> 22:19.040
We want this to kind of get up to like the good

22:19.040 --> 22:21.720
or the strong range eventually.

22:21.720 --> 22:23.320
So the descriptions, right,

22:23.320 --> 22:25.520
we're just going to stick to what the training,

22:25.520 --> 22:26.560
it still works, right?

22:26.560 --> 22:29.480
So we go here, we copy that.

22:30.480 --> 22:32.800
So we're going to do,

22:32.800 --> 22:34.080
we're going to play with that a little bit.

22:34.080 --> 22:35.760
So we specialize in.

22:37.720 --> 22:39.760
And like Jeff said,

22:39.760 --> 22:43.280
you want to complete as many headlines as they give you.

22:43.280 --> 22:44.840
We're just doing it quickly.

22:44.840 --> 22:47.000
So we're not wasting everyone's time,

22:47.000 --> 22:49.600
but you want to, obviously if you're doing it yourself,

22:49.600 --> 22:52.080
same with the descriptions, you have four.

22:52.080 --> 22:53.840
So we're just probably going to fill out two,

22:53.840 --> 22:56.040
but you want to complete as much as you can.

22:59.480 --> 23:00.320
Okay.

23:06.160 --> 23:08.000
That's probably good there.

23:08.000 --> 23:11.760
And then we're going to do, right, we're going to do this.

23:14.240 --> 23:15.880
Okay, and again, guys, we're doing this

23:15.880 --> 23:17.840
because we're trying to make this right

23:17.840 --> 23:21.680
as down and dirty as possible.

23:29.480 --> 23:30.320
So,

23:45.400 --> 23:46.600
I'm going to see, I think I can get,

23:46.600 --> 23:47.440
if I can get that in, right,

23:47.440 --> 23:50.320
I might be able to get cleaning on that.

23:50.320 --> 23:51.160
It's in the area.

23:51.160 --> 23:52.480
Cool.

23:52.480 --> 23:53.320
All right.

23:53.320 --> 23:55.360
So we're going to leave those there, okay?

23:56.560 --> 23:57.760
Your local, affordable,

23:57.760 --> 23:59.880
professional air ducting experts.

23:59.880 --> 24:00.720
Okay, great.

24:00.720 --> 24:02.240
Okay.

24:02.240 --> 24:05.280
And then from there, like that's kind of that.

24:05.280 --> 24:06.840
Okay, again, we'll come back in here

24:06.840 --> 24:09.280
and we'll clean these up and add more

24:09.280 --> 24:11.640
to increase the strength, okay?

24:11.640 --> 24:14.160
So just for time for you guys,

24:15.680 --> 24:17.480
we don't need to spend time doing that right now,

24:17.480 --> 24:20.320
but we'll do that later after the live.

24:20.320 --> 24:21.480
So I'm going to hit done.

24:22.840 --> 24:26.120
You don't need to worry about all those call-outs

24:26.120 --> 24:27.680
and site links and all that stuff.

24:28.480 --> 24:30.040
We'll get into that stuff later,

24:30.040 --> 24:32.080
but don't worry about that for right now.

24:33.280 --> 24:34.960
Now it's going to ask for our daily budget.

24:34.960 --> 24:38.280
Now it doesn't give you the recommendation anymore, right?

24:38.280 --> 24:41.200
So I'm going to move us here.

24:42.200 --> 24:43.400
Zoom so I can see here.

24:43.400 --> 24:45.480
So what we'll do is we'll click here.

24:47.920 --> 24:51.640
So obviously some of the clicks were like high up there.

24:51.640 --> 24:55.160
So we're going to see what it does at $25.

24:55.160 --> 24:57.240
We're going to see what it gives me.

24:57.680 --> 25:01.760
So at $25, it's telling me I can expect about 22 clicks.

25:01.760 --> 25:04.000
It's going to cost me about $160 a week

25:04.000 --> 25:05.920
and this is my average CPC.

25:05.920 --> 25:07.600
So that's not terrible, right?

25:07.600 --> 25:08.920
If you're getting that many clicks

25:08.920 --> 25:10.760
and potential calls a week,

25:10.760 --> 25:14.240
obviously if I went up to like say $55,

25:14.240 --> 25:16.560
it's probably going to give me,

25:16.560 --> 25:19.000
looks like it's giving me the same results, okay?

25:20.280 --> 25:23.800
Let's try like $75, let's just see what it does.

25:23.800 --> 25:24.640
So that's great.

25:24.840 --> 25:26.880
That if that's all good,

25:26.880 --> 25:28.440
we're going to try to bump it down to 20

25:28.440 --> 25:31.320
and see what it does, only 21.

25:31.320 --> 25:32.880
So like, that's not bad.

25:32.880 --> 25:36.400
Let's see if I do 15 and it tells me that's too low.

25:36.400 --> 25:40.200
Okay, so we're going to start at $20

25:40.200 --> 25:42.160
because that seems to be a decent amount, right?

25:42.160 --> 25:44.280
I think anybody would be happy with

25:44.280 --> 25:46.280
that many clicks per week for right now.

25:48.240 --> 25:52.120
And let me move this back up here.

25:52.120 --> 25:53.760
The optimization score at first,

25:53.760 --> 25:54.840
don't worry about that.

25:54.840 --> 25:58.960
That's something that I'll kind of explain in a second,

25:58.960 --> 26:00.760
but don't worry about this right now.

26:02.880 --> 26:05.280
It can get better if you add better headlines

26:05.280 --> 26:07.760
or more headlines and more descriptions and things like that.

26:07.760 --> 26:09.360
So we'll fix that later.

26:09.360 --> 26:11.200
And we're going to do another training series

26:11.200 --> 26:12.040
where we'll go over that,

26:12.040 --> 26:14.320
but don't worry about that for right now.

26:14.320 --> 26:15.960
Okay, so now we go here.

26:18.320 --> 26:21.400
It's going to, we're going to just double check everything

26:21.400 --> 26:22.560
that it's a search campaign.

26:22.560 --> 26:25.960
Sometimes if you forgot to uncheck one of those boxes,

26:25.960 --> 26:30.400
it'll tell you search display and other stuff.

26:32.960 --> 26:35.040
We're doing leads, phone call leads,

26:35.040 --> 26:36.840
we're maximizing clicks.

26:36.840 --> 26:39.600
We're on the Google search network, none of the others.

26:39.600 --> 26:41.160
We have our different locations,

26:41.160 --> 26:43.240
our language, everything here.

26:44.560 --> 26:49.000
All day is 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. and $20 a day.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.640
And we're like, cool, let's go ahead and publish it.

26:53.560 --> 26:56.680
So this ad now goes into what's called a policy review.

27:00.280 --> 27:03.040
Okay, this will take a couple of days.

27:03.040 --> 27:06.320
Okay, and then it should go live.

27:06.320 --> 27:08.280
And then once it goes live,

27:08.280 --> 27:11.160
you're going to be in this thing called bid strategy learning.

27:11.160 --> 27:14.120
Okay, and this takes about five days.

27:14.120 --> 27:17.960
So it takes about seven days for like the ad

27:17.960 --> 27:19.120
to get really warmed up.

27:19.120 --> 27:22.000
So two days to go through policy review

27:22.080 --> 27:23.520
and then about five or six days

27:23.520 --> 27:27.040
of like actually running to do that.

27:27.040 --> 27:29.360
So, but this gets you up and running

27:32.360 --> 27:36.240
and you'll get, you'll definitely gonna be reducing

27:36.240 --> 27:38.760
those really cheap crappy clicks on YouTube,

27:38.760 --> 27:40.520
search partners and stuff like that.

27:40.520 --> 27:42.200
So those are gonna go away.

27:42.200 --> 27:45.040
What you're gonna see is you're gonna see

27:45.040 --> 27:47.840
a lot less impressions because we're only on the one network

27:47.840 --> 27:51.040
for a handful of specific keywords.

27:51.040 --> 27:53.600
So you should have better quality clicks now,

27:53.600 --> 27:56.000
which is what you want, right?

27:56.000 --> 27:57.320
We just set one up the other day

27:57.320 --> 27:59.800
that we're gonna go back and do some filming on.

27:59.800 --> 28:04.800
And I mean, Francesca, what was our estimated daily spend

28:04.920 --> 28:08.280
between the two is like $50 something per day

28:08.280 --> 28:09.400
is what we set it up for.

28:09.400 --> 28:11.720
I know the total for like the month.

28:13.160 --> 28:14.800
Well, I think the daily budget we set up

28:14.800 --> 28:16.840
to be like $45 a day.

28:16.840 --> 28:19.160
Yeah, there's two different ads and we were doing it,

28:19.160 --> 28:22.400
but like our actual spend has been like,

28:23.480 --> 28:26.560
what, maybe the most like $15 in a day.

28:27.680 --> 28:31.280
So way under and they're getting way less impressions

28:31.280 --> 28:33.560
because they're getting more quality impressions.

28:33.560 --> 28:36.680
So the clicks they're getting are a lot more quality.

28:36.680 --> 28:37.640
And that's a great thing

28:37.640 --> 28:39.800
because you're not wasting the ad spend

28:39.800 --> 28:41.560
and you're getting people that are actually looking

28:41.560 --> 28:43.040
for your business.

28:43.040 --> 28:43.880
So.

28:43.880 --> 28:45.280
And yeah, and like we talked,

28:45.280 --> 28:49.000
this ads are something that you kinda wanna keep an eye on

28:49.840 --> 28:50.680
especially the first week,

28:50.680 --> 28:53.800
but it's better to like have it higher and don't get scared.

28:53.800 --> 28:56.800
Like just check in and see how much you're actually spending,

28:56.800 --> 28:59.640
but then you can go and trim it back.

28:59.640 --> 29:00.480
Yes.

29:00.480 --> 29:01.320
Yeah.

29:01.320 --> 29:02.160
Okay.

29:02.160 --> 29:04.160
So I think we covered what we wanted to cover again.

29:04.160 --> 29:06.400
This is for a call only ad.

29:07.360 --> 29:09.320
We'll do another one maybe next week

29:09.320 --> 29:11.840
where we do a click to call ad,

29:11.840 --> 29:14.000
which is the website traffic setting.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.960
It's super similar to this.

29:15.960 --> 29:18.760
It's just, we click another button instead of another.

29:19.640 --> 29:20.480
It's not really a huge difference though,

29:20.480 --> 29:22.800
but we'll set that up just to show you guys.

29:22.800 --> 29:23.880
It's not a huge difference.

29:23.880 --> 29:27.440
It just land differently on the platform.

29:27.440 --> 29:28.280
Okay.

29:28.280 --> 29:30.320
So the call only ad, just FYI,

29:30.320 --> 29:31.720
like that only like,

29:31.720 --> 29:36.560
you will probably not see a lot of like desktop impressions

29:36.560 --> 29:39.520
and or like tablet impressions.

29:39.520 --> 29:42.960
It really only works on devices

29:42.960 --> 29:45.320
that people can click the call.

29:45.320 --> 29:47.080
So like I'm on my Mac,

29:47.120 --> 29:48.040
I could probably get one

29:48.040 --> 29:50.440
because I can FaceTime call out of it if I click.

29:50.440 --> 29:52.160
But what's cool about that is that

29:52.160 --> 29:54.320
it's definitely going to show more on phones.

29:54.320 --> 29:58.240
And that's where most people are calling from anyways, right?

29:58.240 --> 30:02.240
So anyhow, just wanted to throw that out there

30:02.240 --> 30:04.240
and that should help you guys get your phones ringing.

30:04.240 --> 30:06.280
So Francesca, do you have anything

30:06.280 --> 30:08.680
you think we needed to review or cover?

30:08.680 --> 30:10.200
No, I think you did awesome.

30:10.200 --> 30:13.160
The only thing that was kind of weird for me at first,

30:13.160 --> 30:16.440
so I kind of want to throw it out there so people know.

30:16.480 --> 30:19.760
And what we mean by having like a call ad

30:19.760 --> 30:21.800
and then a website ad,

30:21.800 --> 30:25.000
they're all going to be under the same account.

30:25.000 --> 30:28.960
It just means like we set, we go more into depth,

30:28.960 --> 30:31.440
a little bit more advanced than a smart campaign.

30:31.440 --> 30:35.120
And we set up the call ad

30:35.120 --> 30:37.200
and then a separate one under the same account

30:37.200 --> 30:39.240
for the actual website.

30:39.240 --> 30:41.200
Well, doing a smart campaign,

30:41.200 --> 30:44.320
you're letting Google do that for you pretty much, right?

30:44.320 --> 30:45.240
Jeff, is that?

30:47.120 --> 30:49.640
Uh, yes, yeah.

30:49.640 --> 30:53.000
He just kind of makes it into a big mixing bowl

30:53.000 --> 30:55.280
and we're trying to have a little bit more power

30:55.280 --> 30:57.800
and then make it more detailed.

30:58.720 --> 31:01.880
I don't know how else to describe it, but hopefully.

31:01.880 --> 31:02.800
Yeah.

31:02.800 --> 31:06.000
Well, this gets us back to like the original setup

31:06.000 --> 31:08.800
of like the intent of the original smart campaigns

31:08.800 --> 31:13.800
before Google started changing the platform on people.

31:13.840 --> 31:15.760
So this allows everyone to kind of take back

31:15.760 --> 31:17.040
a little bit more control.

31:18.720 --> 31:21.080
And obviously just if you guys start, you know,

31:21.080 --> 31:23.360
try not to play around with the framework too much

31:23.360 --> 31:24.320
if you've not used to it

31:24.320 --> 31:26.800
because you can easily get yourself in trouble.

31:26.800 --> 31:28.840
So we tried to just make this super streamlined,

31:28.840 --> 31:33.040
like click here, do this, do that, don't do that, do this.

31:33.040 --> 31:35.560
We're trying just to keep you guys lined up

31:35.560 --> 31:36.640
and squared away on it.

31:36.640 --> 31:39.880
So you don't get in too much trouble.

31:39.880 --> 31:42.840
That's definitely a potential issue with this.

31:43.800 --> 31:44.880
So hopefully this is helpful

31:44.880 --> 31:48.200
and you guys can be able to use this

31:49.200 --> 31:51.600
for your own campaigns now.

31:52.520 --> 31:56.600
With that, if anybody has any questions on anything,

31:56.600 --> 31:58.120
type them into the Facebook.

31:58.120 --> 31:59.560
I'm not really seeing anything,

31:59.560 --> 32:00.840
but I'm gonna hit refresh here

32:00.840 --> 32:02.160
because that could just be my bad.

32:02.160 --> 32:03.520
So stand by.

32:03.520 --> 32:06.320
But if anybody has any questions on anything,

32:06.320 --> 32:08.240
please type it into the chat

32:08.240 --> 32:11.240
and we'll give you guys a second here.

32:12.080 --> 32:13.520
I'm not seeing anything.

32:13.520 --> 32:15.640
Are you, Francesca?

32:15.640 --> 32:16.800
No.

32:16.800 --> 32:17.640
Okay.

32:17.640 --> 32:18.760
We'll give it a minute.

32:18.760 --> 32:20.040
We'll pin this, right?

32:20.040 --> 32:24.040
So people can watch and pause it while you get started

32:24.040 --> 32:28.680
and then we'll do the website one soon.

32:28.680 --> 32:29.720
Yeah.

32:29.720 --> 32:30.720
Yeah, definitely.

32:30.720 --> 32:32.000
Yeah, we'll get into that.

32:32.960 --> 32:36.400
Okay, someone, oh yeah, should we put negative keywords?

32:36.400 --> 32:38.720
You can, you don't have to right away.

32:39.720 --> 32:41.640
There are some that you want to,

32:41.640 --> 32:46.640
like you go like cost, how to,

32:49.000 --> 32:50.600
depending on what you wanna do,

32:50.600 --> 32:52.600
like cheapest ideas.

32:59.560 --> 33:01.440
It's probably like the main ones off the top of my head

33:01.440 --> 33:03.640
that you wanna load in there first.

33:03.640 --> 33:06.880
And then what'll happen is like after a handful of days,

33:06.920 --> 33:08.760
you'll start seeing, right?

33:08.760 --> 33:11.760
Because there's three different types of keywords, right?

33:11.760 --> 33:14.600
There's broad match, phrase match and exact match.

33:14.600 --> 33:16.880
Broad match is trash, we want that out.

33:16.880 --> 33:18.520
Exact match can be good,

33:18.520 --> 33:22.520
but they have to type in exactly like what you put in there.

33:22.520 --> 33:25.000
So phrase match is good because like,

33:25.000 --> 33:28.280
let's say I'm doing like landscaping.

33:28.280 --> 33:30.960
Well, if I put landscaping as a phrase match,

33:30.960 --> 33:34.000
then it could be like anything landscaping

33:34.000 --> 33:36.120
will show an ad in that region.

33:36.120 --> 33:38.440
So there might be ones where like you see something

33:38.440 --> 33:41.480
and you just take like that one word before or after

33:41.480 --> 33:43.920
and you throw that into the negative keyword list.

33:43.920 --> 33:45.760
But it's definitely a lot easier to manage

33:45.760 --> 33:47.560
than it was with the smart campaign.

33:53.360 --> 33:55.560
So in theory, that should keep a bunch of the legions

33:55.560 --> 33:56.640
from clicking into our ads

33:56.640 --> 33:59.240
since most of them are coming from desktop and those.

34:00.200 --> 34:02.360
Like I think you're talking about like Angie's

34:02.360 --> 34:04.320
and thumbtack and all them.

34:05.160 --> 34:07.960
They will probably be able to still click them,

34:07.960 --> 34:12.080
but it will probably reduce it.

34:12.080 --> 34:15.480
But those guys are spending millions of dollars

34:15.480 --> 34:17.920
to beat the spammers and all the protections and all that.

34:17.920 --> 34:20.080
So hopefully it'll reduce it a little bit,

34:20.080 --> 34:24.160
but it's just part of the game now, unfortunately.

34:26.520 --> 34:28.720
All right, are there any other questions?

34:35.160 --> 34:36.720
I know it's the delay, huh?

34:39.280 --> 34:41.840
I don't see anything, but we'll see.

34:41.840 --> 34:43.800
Yeah, all right, we'll just give them a minute.

34:43.800 --> 34:45.760
Like I said, there's like, there's this weird delay.

34:45.760 --> 34:47.360
It's taken me a while to get used to.

34:49.960 --> 34:51.000
Okay, here we go.

34:53.400 --> 34:55.360
So Alex says, we have an ad we set up

34:55.360 --> 34:56.640
under the Google smart campaign.

34:56.640 --> 34:58.520
We received 520 clicks,

34:59.200 --> 35:02.200
47, almost 48,000 impressions.

35:02.200 --> 35:03.920
Yeah, it's six months of the cost.

35:03.920 --> 35:06.200
We received no calls and of course, we,

35:06.200 --> 35:09.160
yeah, it's just starting to turn and move on.

35:09.160 --> 35:10.560
I would try to redo it,

35:10.560 --> 35:13.560
but if you're getting that many clicks

35:13.560 --> 35:16.480
and really low CPC like that,

35:16.480 --> 35:20.440
I would bet that you probably have the budget

35:20.440 --> 35:22.800
set too low for the smart campaign.

35:22.800 --> 35:26.200
But what you can do is just pass the ad

35:26.240 --> 35:30.480
but what you can do is just kind of pause that.

35:30.480 --> 35:32.600
You probably have a lot of the good stuff already loaded

35:32.600 --> 35:35.600
like your keywords and your locations

35:37.800 --> 35:39.200
and your headlines and descriptions.

35:39.200 --> 35:43.640
And I would just create a new search campaign

35:43.640 --> 35:47.520
and then just set up the call campaign with the leads

35:47.520 --> 35:48.640
and just set that up.

35:48.640 --> 35:51.280
And you'll probably notice a significant drop

35:51.280 --> 35:52.640
in impressions.

35:52.640 --> 35:55.120
You're gonna notice a significant drop in clicks.

35:55.120 --> 35:59.400
However, you're going to get a higher CPC

35:59.400 --> 36:01.600
but you're gonna get better click-throughs.

36:17.040 --> 36:18.560
Got it, thanks, you're welcome.

36:18.560 --> 36:19.400
Okay.

36:25.120 --> 36:30.120
Sorry, I need some weird people emailing me right now.

36:42.920 --> 36:45.720
Okay, Francesca, do you have anything else to add?

36:47.080 --> 36:49.440
No, I don't.

36:49.440 --> 36:50.840
I think this is a good start.

36:50.840 --> 36:53.760
It'll get everyone to be able to set them up

36:53.760 --> 36:58.360
at least this first part, like the call ad

36:58.360 --> 37:02.400
and then we'll go more in depth into the website one

37:02.400 --> 37:06.680
and the webpage one, sorry, and everything else.

37:06.680 --> 37:07.640
Yeah, definitely.

37:07.640 --> 37:10.400
Like I said, everybody, next week we'll go in here,

37:10.400 --> 37:13.360
probably use the same one and we'll set up the one

37:13.360 --> 37:15.000
for the click to call ads,

37:15.000 --> 37:16.880
which is the website traffic thing.

37:16.880 --> 37:19.840
It's literally pretty much the same process.

37:19.840 --> 37:22.920
There's just a couple of small tweaks on it.

37:22.920 --> 37:25.280
We just wanted to show you guys the fast, easy way

37:25.280 --> 37:26.840
to get this going and get on it.

37:26.840 --> 37:29.840
So I don't really see a lot of people on,

37:29.840 --> 37:31.400
not seeing a lot of other questions come in.

37:31.400 --> 37:34.320
So we're gonna end the call here.

37:34.320 --> 37:37.360
And once this kind of uploads and processes,

37:37.360 --> 37:41.240
we'll go ahead and make sure it gets pinned to the top

37:41.240 --> 37:43.920
or put in the files or something like that.

37:43.920 --> 37:45.320
And we'll do that.

37:45.320 --> 37:49.320
So Francesca, thank you as always for your expertise

37:49.320 --> 37:50.160
and helping out.

37:50.200 --> 37:51.040
Thank you, Jeff.

37:51.040 --> 37:53.280
Hopefully this helps.

37:53.280 --> 37:54.120
I think it will.

37:54.120 --> 37:56.160
I think a lot of people are gonna be pretty stoked on it.

37:56.160 --> 37:59.760
Like if they implemented it tomorrow,

37:59.760 --> 38:01.160
by the time the weekend's over,

38:01.160 --> 38:03.080
they'll be out of policy review.

38:03.080 --> 38:06.400
And by Monday, Tuesday, they should start seeing some calls.

38:06.400 --> 38:09.080
And just like we've seen on the one we set up for you,

38:09.080 --> 38:10.680
that was just a little over a week ago now,

38:10.680 --> 38:11.800
like eight days or so.

38:11.800 --> 38:13.240
Like did you notice yesterday,

38:13.240 --> 38:15.800
like a lot more clicks and calls yesterday?

38:15.800 --> 38:17.600
We got one lead today.

38:17.600 --> 38:18.520
Yeah.

38:18.520 --> 38:19.640
Okay, yeah.

38:19.640 --> 38:20.480
So we're already seeing,

38:20.480 --> 38:22.200
like we can watch the uptick already.

38:22.200 --> 38:24.240
Like as it comes out of that policy review

38:24.240 --> 38:25.840
and that learning strategy,

38:25.840 --> 38:28.040
you can start seeing it kind of hit its groove,

38:28.040 --> 38:29.560
which is really common to the same thing.

38:29.560 --> 38:32.000
That was the same thing with the smart campaigns, right?

38:32.000 --> 38:33.680
It has to go through a few days.

38:33.680 --> 38:34.520
That's why we always say,

38:34.520 --> 38:37.640
hey, let things go for a couple of weeks.

38:38.560 --> 38:39.400
With this stuff,

38:39.400 --> 38:41.280
there's gonna be a little more maintenance off the top,

38:41.280 --> 38:42.920
but it's a simple thing.

38:42.920 --> 38:45.360
And we'll go over that maybe next week as well.

38:45.360 --> 38:47.120
So, cool.

38:47.120 --> 38:48.440
All right, everybody.

38:48.440 --> 38:49.320
Since we don't see anything,

38:50.000 --> 38:51.000
you guys are welcome.

38:51.000 --> 38:51.880
We'll pin this up

38:51.880 --> 38:54.480
and then you guys have any questions, reach out to us.

38:54.480 --> 38:55.440
All right, take care.

38:55.440 --> 38:56.280
Thanks again.

38:56.280 --> 38:57.100
Thank you.

38:57.100 --> 38:57.940
All right, bye.
