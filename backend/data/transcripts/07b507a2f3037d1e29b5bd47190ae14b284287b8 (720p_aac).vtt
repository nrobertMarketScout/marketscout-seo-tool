WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.200
Okay guys, officially welcome to today's call, it's February 11th, 7 a.m. and today we're

00:08.200 --> 00:12.560
going to be talking about closing on the first call.

00:12.560 --> 00:17.080
Really really quick though guys, just a couple things I want to cover.

00:17.080 --> 00:23.160
First of all, if you're not in the Rank and Rent Academy, if you are in this group, you

00:23.160 --> 00:27.400
have free lifetime access as long as you're of course a member of this group, you get

00:27.400 --> 00:30.080
access to the Rank and Rent Academy.

00:30.080 --> 00:34.080
There's nothing in there that you're not going to get in here, this is where you should spend

00:34.080 --> 00:35.080
your time.

00:35.080 --> 00:38.040
However, I will tell you that there's some people I can see right now that are on this

00:38.040 --> 00:41.600
slide that are taking advantage of the things in that group.

00:41.600 --> 00:46.100
Every single Monday at 7 a.m. I go live and I do a Q&A.

00:46.100 --> 00:47.100
Every single Monday.

00:47.100 --> 00:52.560
Now, I will tell you there are things that I refuse to cover in that group because those

00:52.560 --> 00:56.400
people, the ones that are not in this group have not paid for that knowledge.

00:56.760 --> 01:01.360
For example, yesterday we had somebody ask a question about ads and I told them, hey,

01:01.360 --> 01:02.520
you want to learn ads?

01:02.520 --> 01:05.280
You got to pay the piper, you got to pay me, who's paid the piper?

01:05.280 --> 01:06.720
So I'm not going to cover ads.

01:06.720 --> 01:11.360
But there's a lot of other stuff that we cover and so if you guys have questions, you guys

01:11.360 --> 01:17.440
want more FaceTime with me, you guys have paid to be here and so you get access to that.

01:17.440 --> 01:24.760
It's funny, that call is actually dominated by Digital Landlord students so it's amazing.

01:24.920 --> 01:30.720
It makes me happy because I'm able to help you guys from this group inside of that group

01:30.720 --> 01:31.720
as well.

01:31.720 --> 01:35.960
Okay, so that said guys, that is every single Monday at 7 a.m.

01:35.960 --> 01:42.320
If you do not have access to the RankinRent Academy, message, not Francesca, message Ashley,

01:42.320 --> 01:43.320
she'll get you access.

01:43.320 --> 01:44.320
Okay?

01:44.320 --> 01:48.840
A couple quick things about the RankinRent Engine tool.

01:48.840 --> 01:52.320
First and foremost, if you don't know what that is, go to RankinRentEngine.com, it is

01:52.320 --> 01:54.680
the only tool that you need for this business.

01:54.680 --> 01:58.440
You do not, number one, you do not need any tools to make money.

01:58.440 --> 01:59.440
Okay?

01:59.440 --> 02:02.680
Just going to say that out front, you do not need any tools to make money.

02:02.680 --> 02:08.280
I was able to cobble about eight different tools together and I was able to make my money.

02:08.280 --> 02:09.280
But it was a pain.

02:09.280 --> 02:12.360
I spent a lot of time, I spent a lot of effort, I actually spent a lot of money trying to

02:12.360 --> 02:13.360
figure it out.

02:13.360 --> 02:16.840
But I want you guys to know this is not something that you have to do.

02:16.840 --> 02:19.840
It does make things a lot easier.

02:19.840 --> 02:20.840
Doing due diligence.

02:21.360 --> 02:25.600
I was talking to somebody yesterday that was doing, that is in RankinRent Engine.

02:25.600 --> 02:29.880
They're like, yeah, I've already looked at 50 cities, 50 cities, you know how long it

02:29.880 --> 02:30.880
takes to look at 50 cities?

02:30.880 --> 02:31.880
It takes about 30 minutes.

02:31.880 --> 02:33.440
When you first start, probably takes an hour.

02:33.440 --> 02:37.400
But let's say you get good at it, it takes 30 minutes, 30 minutes times 50, do the math.

02:37.400 --> 02:38.400
That's how long it takes to do 50.

02:38.400 --> 02:40.240
This guy just busted them out, okay?

02:40.240 --> 02:44.840
But on the business of Rare, a couple things that you should know.

02:44.840 --> 02:50.120
Number one is there, if you go in, you log in, there is a user metrics dashboard that

02:50.120 --> 02:51.120
is now live.

02:51.120 --> 02:52.240
You can see your progress.

02:52.240 --> 02:56.200
You can see your, you know, did my revenue increase, decrease, clients, all this different

02:56.200 --> 02:57.200
stuff.

02:57.200 --> 02:59.320
It is, it's a great like snapshot of your business.

02:59.320 --> 03:00.320
So that's live.

03:00.320 --> 03:03.360
That is a new feature or a new view that we've added.

03:03.360 --> 03:08.760
Also, I've said this a few times with the backlink analyzer 1.0 is live.

03:08.760 --> 03:11.000
When I say 1.0, we are going to be beefing that up.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
We're going to be looking at that for, we're going to be able to, we're going to allow

03:14.000 --> 03:18.240
you guys to be able to look at the backlinks of your competitors from different views,

03:18.240 --> 03:19.240
not just the root domain.

03:19.240 --> 03:25.280
But for now, you can go and you can jam in the root domain of any of your competitors

03:25.280 --> 03:26.640
or any website at all.

03:26.640 --> 03:28.680
And you can go and take a look at the backlinks, okay?

03:28.680 --> 03:31.720
So the backlink analyzer 1.0 is live.

03:31.720 --> 03:35.480
And then one other cool thing, we're trying to keep everything into one place to make

03:35.480 --> 03:36.480
it as easy as possible.

03:36.480 --> 03:40.960
So you guys can have your, your browser open, you have rank and rent engine, you have Google,

03:40.960 --> 03:44.680
you know, you're doing some, some searching on different cities and, and that's it.

03:44.680 --> 03:47.960
You don't have to have a million different softwares open that are all talking.

03:48.000 --> 03:54.520
We're also adding the, the lead value calculator inside of rank and rent engine.

03:54.520 --> 03:59.920
Now I, for those of you that were on yesterday on the rank and rent Academy call, I thought

03:59.920 --> 04:00.920
it was completely live.

04:00.920 --> 04:02.200
We've just sent it into production.

04:02.200 --> 04:04.000
So within the next week or two, that will be live.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
Okay.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.480
Anyway, just want to give you guys some updates on that.

04:06.480 --> 04:07.480
It's exciting.

04:07.480 --> 04:08.480
We're making changes.

04:08.480 --> 04:09.480
We're moving.

04:09.480 --> 04:17.320
And anybody that has any recommendations, anything they'd like to see done to that tool,

04:17.320 --> 04:18.320
please email me.

04:18.320 --> 04:22.560
My, my email is nick at digital landlords.com.

04:22.560 --> 04:25.760
You guys can send me an email, send me a, Hey, I would like to see this done.

04:25.760 --> 04:26.840
I'd like to see it do this.

04:26.840 --> 04:31.320
Like for example, we had somebody yesterday from this group that was asking about a quick

04:31.320 --> 04:33.560
little duplication button.

04:33.560 --> 04:36.880
So I take that, I forward it over to Ryan and we can jump on that as soon as possible.

04:36.880 --> 04:38.400
So guys, I'm super excited about that.

04:38.400 --> 04:39.720
We've brought that to you.

04:39.720 --> 04:44.800
That is somebody from this group, Ryan Dalton, who not only build a software, but he's scaled

04:44.800 --> 04:50.880
up to a hundred thousand dollars per month in less than two years.

04:50.880 --> 04:53.560
And just in case anyone's wondering what his numbers are.

04:53.560 --> 04:58.040
So Ryan Dalton, by the way, everyone should, should give Ryan some, some love in the comments.

04:58.040 --> 04:59.040
I know he's not on this call right now.

04:59.040 --> 05:03.560
He's, he's probably got a million things going on, but a dude went from zero to a hundred

05:03.560 --> 05:06.640
K a month in two years, kept his job.

05:06.640 --> 05:07.920
Okay.

05:07.920 --> 05:09.760
Also as a family has a regular life.

05:09.760 --> 05:14.280
He's not just like, you know, let's say Elon Musk that just got divorced three times.

05:14.760 --> 05:17.320
He's kept all that.

05:17.320 --> 05:20.080
And they built rank and run engine on top of that, which is unbelievable.

05:20.080 --> 05:23.200
So his breakdown, he's making a hundred thousand bucks per month.

05:23.200 --> 05:27.280
Eighty six thousand of that is purely Legion.

05:27.280 --> 05:32.840
So he's making over his run right now is over a million dollars a year just on lead generation.

05:32.840 --> 05:39.040
The remaining 14, 15,000 that he's making is a combination of SEO and some PPC management

05:39.040 --> 05:40.280
on some ad stuff.

05:40.280 --> 05:41.280
Okay.

05:42.280 --> 05:46.880
The way I always look at it, guys, is if somebody else is out there that can do it, somebody

05:46.880 --> 05:49.480
else out there that bleeds red, you can do it.

05:49.480 --> 05:50.480
Okay.

05:50.480 --> 05:52.360
That's the way I always look at it is somebody else can do it.

05:52.360 --> 05:53.360
I can do it.

05:53.360 --> 05:55.240
There's no difference between me and Ryan.

05:55.240 --> 05:57.560
There's no difference between me and anybody else.

05:57.560 --> 06:01.340
Differences is they're figuring, they figured out how to use leverage and how to focus on

06:01.340 --> 06:03.520
one thing for a longer period of time.

06:03.520 --> 06:04.520
That's it.

06:04.520 --> 06:07.720
So that's exciting for me when I ever, I see anyone that's way ahead of me.

06:07.720 --> 06:11.020
If I see someone that's making a million dollars a month, well, then of course it's possible

06:11.020 --> 06:12.020
for me.

06:12.020 --> 06:13.020
Okay.

06:13.020 --> 06:15.300
So anyway, guys, that's the updates on Rank and Run Engine.

06:15.300 --> 06:18.940
For those of you, because I have one or two people every time that message me, I'll drop

06:18.940 --> 06:19.940
this in the chat.

06:19.940 --> 06:22.980
We have a discount code for anyone that wants to check that out.

06:22.980 --> 06:29.180
Let me go ahead and drop this really quick if I can find my browser.

06:29.180 --> 06:30.180
There it is.

06:30.180 --> 06:32.180
New landlord, discount on rare.

06:32.180 --> 06:33.180
All right.

06:33.180 --> 06:35.700
With that said, I want to, I just want to say one thing and then we're going to get,

06:35.700 --> 06:36.700
I'm going to get Kyle on here.

06:36.700 --> 06:41.500
We're going to be talking about closing on the first call.

06:41.500 --> 06:45.900
I want you guys to think for just a moment, okay, about a time, whether it was in this

06:45.900 --> 06:51.580
business or it was just a time in your professional life or maybe it was just in your regular

06:51.580 --> 06:52.580
life.

06:52.580 --> 06:58.820
But like, I want you to think about a time when, and Kyle Patton, Mr. Frickin' 6'9",

06:58.820 --> 07:00.580
I want you to do the same if you're listening.

07:00.580 --> 07:05.580
I want you to think about a time that you were just humming.

07:05.580 --> 07:06.860
Time was on your side.

07:06.860 --> 07:07.860
Everything was clicking.

07:07.860 --> 07:09.140
You guys know exactly what I'm talking about.

07:09.140 --> 07:11.540
It's like you're excited.

07:11.540 --> 07:13.300
It feels like you're making deals.

07:13.300 --> 07:16.180
You're closing deals all over the place.

07:16.180 --> 07:17.300
Everything's going your way.

07:17.300 --> 07:21.300
Obviously, it's not easy, but you're just, you have the energy, the excitement to keep

07:21.300 --> 07:22.900
going because things are happening.

07:22.900 --> 07:25.180
You're seeing progress.

07:25.180 --> 07:26.180
Everything's just clicking.

07:26.180 --> 07:27.180
Okay.

07:27.180 --> 07:31.100
Again, preferably if you could think of a time in this business, I can think of a time.

07:31.100 --> 07:32.100
That's 2020 for me.

07:32.100 --> 07:33.100
Okay.

07:33.220 --> 07:36.260
But that was the first time I really, really felt it.

07:36.260 --> 07:39.180
And I want you to ask yourself the following questions because this is what I've been asking

07:39.180 --> 07:41.740
myself all of this year.

07:41.740 --> 07:42.740
Okay.

07:42.740 --> 07:48.500
Number one, have you stopped doing the things that got you to where you are today or that

07:48.500 --> 07:51.780
got you to the success that you are thinking about?

07:51.780 --> 07:53.180
Okay.

07:53.180 --> 07:56.260
Have you stopped doing those things that got you that success?

07:56.260 --> 07:57.260
That's question number one.

07:57.260 --> 07:58.340
This is rhetorical.

07:58.340 --> 07:59.900
You can answer if you want.

07:59.940 --> 08:05.700
Secondly, on the flip side, have you started doing things that you weren't doing when you

08:05.700 --> 08:07.620
had the success?

08:07.620 --> 08:11.220
Example, you weren't watching Netflix every single night.

08:11.220 --> 08:12.220
Now you are.

08:12.220 --> 08:15.980
I want you to legitimately think about that.

08:15.980 --> 08:20.100
Have you stopped doing the things that got you where you are today or that got you to

08:20.100 --> 08:21.780
that success?

08:21.780 --> 08:26.820
Have you started doing things that you weren't doing when you had the success?

08:26.820 --> 08:29.860
So guys, the reason I'm bringing this up is I'm talking to myself because at the end

08:29.860 --> 08:35.620
of last year, I realized that the very things that allowed me to create two seven-figure

08:35.620 --> 08:43.980
companies in three years, literally all the basic little tiny things that I was doing

08:43.980 --> 08:48.900
that got me the success of creating two seven-figure companies, I had stopped doing.

08:48.900 --> 08:55.260
I slowly stopped doing last year and it's embarrassing to say, but I have to own it.

08:55.580 --> 08:57.340
It happens slowly over time.

08:57.340 --> 09:01.900
You stop doing your weekly planning and all of a sudden you stop doing your company meeting.

09:01.900 --> 09:05.220
Then you start doing this.

09:05.220 --> 09:09.620
You start going out on Tuesdays or going out on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday instead

09:09.620 --> 09:13.460
of saying, hey, I'm just going to go out on Saturday, I'm just going to go out on Friday.

09:13.460 --> 09:16.620
For me, 2020, I was super scrappy.

09:16.620 --> 09:17.620
I was hustler.

09:17.620 --> 09:19.660
I was willing to do things that were unscalable.

09:19.660 --> 09:22.900
I was willing to jump on a sales call at 7 a.m. on a Saturday morning.

09:22.900 --> 09:27.580
I actually chose to schedule a sales call every Saturday morning at 7 a.m. just to get

09:27.580 --> 09:31.260
my butt out of bed and just to get me in bed Friday night.

09:31.260 --> 09:35.460
I was willing to jump on sales calls at 11 o'clock at night.

09:35.460 --> 09:37.780
I was willing to miss events.

09:37.780 --> 09:41.980
I was willing to give up golf and pickleball and all these hobbies to get the deal.

09:41.980 --> 09:44.020
I was scrappy, man.

09:44.020 --> 09:45.020
That was what I did.

09:45.020 --> 09:47.340
I was reading 10 pages of a good book.

09:47.340 --> 09:53.180
All these little things that got me into this success, I had completely stopped doing.

09:53.180 --> 09:56.900
It became very apparent just two months ago in December.

09:56.900 --> 09:57.900
I just looked at my life.

09:57.900 --> 09:58.900
I took inventory.

09:58.900 --> 10:00.980
I'm like, what am I doing?

10:00.980 --> 10:02.660
I stopped doing all of those things.

10:02.660 --> 10:05.140
I had started watching Netflix during the week.

10:05.140 --> 10:09.340
I'd started spending time during the workday doing hobbies when I should have been working.

10:09.340 --> 10:14.220
I started taking meaningless calls that weren't getting me closer to my goal.

10:14.220 --> 10:18.900
I started going out on the weekdays instead of just the weekends.

10:18.900 --> 10:21.740
Guys, on January 1st, I made a commitment.

10:21.740 --> 10:23.780
I'm like, I'm cleaning this up.

10:23.780 --> 10:24.780
I am done.

10:24.780 --> 10:27.220
I'm going back to the basics.

10:27.220 --> 10:32.060
I went live yesterday and I told you guys this, but guys, January, and shout out to

10:32.060 --> 10:34.620
Kyle who's going to jump on, he crushed it.

10:34.620 --> 10:40.540
We had the biggest month we had in over 12 months, probably further than that, but we

10:41.300 --> 10:45.340
January than we had all of 2024 in any of the months of 2024.

10:45.340 --> 10:47.100
By the way, my internet looks a tiny bit glitchy.

10:47.100 --> 10:48.100
I apologize.

10:48.100 --> 10:49.380
We're going to just roll with it.

10:49.380 --> 10:54.400
So guys, don't forget what brought you the success in the first place.

10:54.400 --> 10:57.980
Do not forget, and I'm not trying to be motivational, whatever.

10:57.980 --> 11:00.140
I'm just speaking to myself.

11:00.140 --> 11:02.980
Don't forget those things that got you the success in the first place.

11:02.980 --> 11:04.220
It's all those little things that add up.

11:04.220 --> 11:05.220
I promise you that.

11:05.220 --> 11:08.620
So with that said, let me get Kyle on really quick and let's talk about closing on the

11:08.620 --> 11:18.620
first call.

11:18.620 --> 11:21.660
Real quick, David Dale, is Rankin' Red Academy separate from Digital Landlords?

11:21.660 --> 11:22.660
David Dale, yes.

11:22.660 --> 11:25.460
Rankin' Red Academy is separate from Digital Landlords.

11:25.460 --> 11:31.380
Rankin' Red Academy is basically like the equivalent of our old Facebook group.

11:31.380 --> 11:34.580
And by the way, you can message Ashley, you can be a part of it, you can go and build

11:34.580 --> 11:38.540
the community, whatever, but you do not need Rankin' Red Academy.

11:39.460 --> 11:43.540
If you're looking at spending time in Rankin' Red Academy, and here, this is a trillion

11:43.540 --> 11:45.060
times better, right?

11:45.060 --> 11:49.420
The only reason I'm talking about Rankin' Red Academy is we have a live call on Monday

11:49.420 --> 11:50.420
7 a.m.

11:50.420 --> 11:56.180
If you want some extra time with me, you want questions answered from me, jump on 7 a.m.

11:56.180 --> 11:57.180
MST.

11:57.180 --> 12:01.860
There's a link in the calendar section inside of the Rankin' Red Academy, and you guys can

12:01.860 --> 12:06.660
go and access that, but don't for one second think that you need access to that.

12:06.780 --> 12:09.820
It is free for you guys, but I would rather you spend your time here, because this is

12:09.820 --> 12:11.700
where all the juicy stuff is.

12:11.700 --> 12:16.220
Kevin Mija's on, Nick Kudlick, another St. George guy's on, what's up, dude?

12:16.220 --> 12:17.220
Laura Shepard's on.

12:17.220 --> 12:18.220
Kyle Patton, what's up, bro?

12:18.220 --> 12:19.220
What's happening?

12:19.220 --> 12:20.220
Can you hear me?

12:20.220 --> 12:21.220
Yeah, I can hear you.

12:21.220 --> 12:22.220
Amazing.

12:22.220 --> 12:27.700
Okay, Kyle, you're going to give me 13 seconds while I go close my door before you guys keep

12:27.700 --> 12:28.700
hearing my kids.

12:28.700 --> 12:29.700
Hold tight.

12:29.700 --> 12:30.700
You know the drill, bud.

12:30.700 --> 12:35.700
Go ahead and welcome the people.

12:35.740 --> 12:43.140
You know, this is not my, dude, just sit here and talk in front of people that I can't see.

12:43.140 --> 12:44.620
But what's up, everybody?

12:44.620 --> 12:48.700
If you got sales questions, start dropping them in the chat.

12:53.700 --> 12:54.700
All right, bud, don't worry.

12:54.700 --> 12:55.700
I'm back.

12:56.700 --> 12:59.820
This is not Kyle's cup of tea, so give him a shout out.

12:59.820 --> 13:00.820
This is my cup of tea.

13:00.820 --> 13:03.940
Kyle, I promise you, you start doing this regularly, bud, it will become your cup of

13:03.940 --> 13:04.940
tea.

13:05.180 --> 13:07.060
I don't think so, man.

13:07.060 --> 13:12.500
So guys, Kyle, let's see a couple things about Kyle.

13:12.500 --> 13:14.380
Let's give it for anybody that doesn't know Kyle.

13:14.380 --> 13:17.300
You should know Kyle because you spoke with him to get in this call.

13:17.300 --> 13:20.780
If you didn't, you're one of the rare ones that talked to me, maybe talked to Francesca

13:20.780 --> 13:23.020
because Kyle was on a hunting trip.

13:23.020 --> 13:27.540
But Kyle, how long have you been doing sales, Kyle?

13:27.540 --> 13:28.540
Since 2015.

13:28.540 --> 13:32.100
2015, he started doing door to door sales.

13:32.100 --> 13:33.780
Was it two years you did door to door sales?

13:33.780 --> 13:36.060
Yeah, two years door to door.

13:36.060 --> 13:43.140
Two years door to door sales, then since then, since 2015, all you've done is sales.

13:43.140 --> 13:44.140
Right.

13:44.140 --> 13:45.140
Yep.

13:45.140 --> 13:51.660
And you've sold everything imaginable, short of like magazines and like shoe cleaner, right?

13:51.660 --> 13:52.660
Anything and everything.

13:52.660 --> 13:53.660
Yep.

13:53.660 --> 13:54.660
Yeah.

13:54.660 --> 13:58.220
So just to kind of give you guys a little bit of an idea, Kyle, we sold alarm systems.

13:58.220 --> 14:02.720
Then we sold a software that we pre-sold a software that never became a software.

14:02.720 --> 14:08.040
So that is impressive in and of itself that we sold something that never was anything.

14:08.040 --> 14:10.440
We didn't know at the time.

14:10.440 --> 14:15.880
Then from there, we tried to sell, what was it?

14:15.880 --> 14:21.160
We tried selling SEO services, some paper lead, lead gen services.

14:21.160 --> 14:24.440
Then Kyle and I had like a falling out.

14:24.440 --> 14:25.440
Long story.

14:25.440 --> 14:26.440
We'll share that one another day.

14:26.440 --> 14:27.440
It was good.

14:27.440 --> 14:29.160
Kyle went and where did you go work?

14:29.160 --> 14:30.880
What did you go do sell?

14:31.120 --> 14:33.320
Software for storage facilities.

14:33.320 --> 14:34.320
Yeah.

14:34.320 --> 14:36.080
Kyle went and sold software for storage facilities.

14:36.080 --> 14:40.560
But even before that, he was selling like those cartoon infographic things, right?

14:40.560 --> 14:41.560
Yeah.

14:41.560 --> 14:42.560
Yeah.

14:42.560 --> 14:43.560
Why draw?

14:43.560 --> 14:45.240
Don't forget about this, bro.

14:45.240 --> 14:46.520
You sold those two.

14:46.520 --> 14:49.120
Dude, Kyle has sold everything.

14:49.120 --> 14:57.140
Finally I was able to convince him in, what was it, 2022 to come back to the promised

14:57.140 --> 14:58.140
land.

14:58.140 --> 14:59.140
And here he is.

14:59.140 --> 15:03.340
Guys, Kyle is an amazing resource for you guys.

15:03.340 --> 15:08.940
The good thing about Kyle is he has a very different sales style than myself, where I'll

15:08.940 --> 15:13.660
say things that can maybe get under people's skin or maybe a little bit too, they're a

15:13.660 --> 15:15.460
little bit on the edge.

15:15.460 --> 15:21.300
Kyle, I don't think, have you ever made anyone upset on a call?

15:21.300 --> 15:22.300
I try not to.

15:22.300 --> 15:23.300
I don't think so.

15:23.300 --> 15:27.620
I'm sure there's been a couple, I've ruffled some feathers, but it's pretty rare.

15:27.620 --> 15:28.620
Yeah.

15:29.100 --> 15:34.980
I like it because for a lot of you guys, it's way more relatable to the way that he sells.

15:34.980 --> 15:41.260
And he's actually, so obviously you guys know he's the one that brought you guys in here.

15:41.260 --> 15:46.420
Kyle has brought in, how many students have you brought into this program?

15:46.420 --> 15:47.980
Just over 500 now.

15:47.980 --> 15:48.980
Just over 500.

15:48.980 --> 15:51.220
So we have like, what, close to 800 students, right?

15:51.220 --> 15:52.220
Something like that?

15:52.220 --> 15:53.220
Yeah.

15:53.220 --> 15:54.220
So close to 800.

15:54.220 --> 15:56.540
So Kyle's brought more people into this group than I have.

15:56.540 --> 16:00.860
So Kyle has in the last two years has done far more sales than I have done.

16:00.860 --> 16:05.220
So anyway, I just want you guys to know that back story, to know that he is a very credible

16:05.220 --> 16:08.700
person when it comes to sales, he's been, I bet you he's done more sales calls than

16:08.700 --> 16:13.840
I have at this point because he's done so many, he's doing multiple per week.

16:13.840 --> 16:18.140
So anyway, let me just kind of set the background.

16:18.140 --> 16:23.540
And by the way, Kyle, just for everyone to have an idea, like you didn't grow up doing

16:23.540 --> 16:24.540
sales.

16:24.620 --> 16:29.740
What you did before sales just to paint a picture.

16:29.740 --> 16:37.140
Yeah, I grew up working kind of on a neighbor's farm and then worked at Cal Ranch in high

16:37.140 --> 16:43.940
school and then painted houses for like six years, worked for a fencing company.

16:43.940 --> 16:49.800
So pretty much all physical, physical labor, manual labor kind of jobs, nothing, nothing

16:49.800 --> 16:50.800
within sales.

16:50.800 --> 16:51.800
Yeah.

16:52.120 --> 16:56.520
When I met Kyle trying to convince him to do door to door, he was doing house painting.

16:56.520 --> 17:00.280
So he was just a regular like blue collar dude.

17:00.280 --> 17:05.480
And the only reason that I knew he would do well is we had a mutual friend that was like,

17:05.480 --> 17:07.640
hey, you should hit my buddy up, Kyle.

17:07.640 --> 17:12.400
And I could just tell Kyle, I'm like, dude, if this guy is willing to paint houses, then

17:12.400 --> 17:14.600
he's going to crush it at door to door sales.

17:14.600 --> 17:19.420
And I remember he was like pretty apprehensive because I don't, has anyone in your family

17:19.420 --> 17:22.180
ever done sales or anything like that?

17:22.180 --> 17:23.180
No.

17:23.180 --> 17:24.180
Yeah.

17:24.180 --> 17:28.300
And it's like a taboo in Utah, you know, it's like you serve a mission, then you go

17:28.300 --> 17:32.260
do door to door sales and everybody thinks door to door sales is just a scam.

17:32.260 --> 17:34.140
So that was like my biggest hesitation.

17:34.140 --> 17:39.460
Yeah, I still, Kyle made me drive up to like four hour drive, like two or three times before

17:39.460 --> 17:41.980
he finally agreed to come and do door to door sales.

17:41.980 --> 17:43.980
So dude, let's do this to start.

17:43.980 --> 17:44.980
This would be fun.

17:44.980 --> 17:49.180
And by the way, today we're going to be talking about closing on the first call, getting someone

17:49.180 --> 17:51.940
on the zoom, not letting them off, getting a yes or no.

17:51.940 --> 17:54.660
But Kyle, let's from what you can remember.

17:54.660 --> 17:59.180
So we recruited Kyle back in 2015.

17:59.180 --> 18:03.260
And we were like, Kyle, come out to Vegas, come out to Henderson, Nevada.

18:03.260 --> 18:06.740
Let's go do some sales training before we just go to Arkansas.

18:06.740 --> 18:07.740
So Kyle comes out.

18:07.740 --> 18:10.140
Kyle, do you remember the first deal that you landed?

18:10.140 --> 18:17.220
Yeah, that old guy, Russ Russell, you never forget the first deal, you know what I mean?

18:17.260 --> 18:19.700
So I just remember I put Kyle in this neighborhood.

18:19.700 --> 18:21.900
He was burning doors, dude.

18:21.900 --> 18:24.660
I mean, you went through like three neighborhoods in three days.

18:24.660 --> 18:26.660
Oh, I was just cooking.

18:26.660 --> 18:28.460
He was just calling me every day.

18:28.460 --> 18:30.100
He's like, yeah, I finished the neighborhood.

18:30.100 --> 18:32.540
I'm like, bro, there's like 57 homes in there.

18:32.540 --> 18:35.100
What do you mean you finished the neighborhood?

18:35.100 --> 18:40.220
So finally on Saturday, he gets in this house with this old guy.

18:40.220 --> 18:42.340
And I can't remember what happened.

18:42.340 --> 18:45.460
Somehow I came over the house, dude, and we we we wield and deal, dude.

18:45.460 --> 18:48.900
It was like it was like one of those deals you get on, you pitch at a thousand bucks

18:48.900 --> 18:49.900
a month.

18:49.900 --> 18:53.260
You end up doing it for like five hundred a month and your ads are four hundred.

18:53.260 --> 18:54.940
But you got the deal.

18:54.940 --> 18:56.700
And that was Kyle's first deal.

18:56.700 --> 18:59.100
And he went on to make some great money for the next two years.

18:59.100 --> 19:00.660
And then here we are.

19:00.660 --> 19:04.860
So anyway, guys, let's talk about this.

19:04.860 --> 19:10.340
When I first started doing door to door sales, and I'm sure you were the same, Kyle, I would

19:10.340 --> 19:14.260
get the objection like I want to think about it.

19:14.260 --> 19:16.500
Leave me with your card, all that kind of stuff.

19:16.500 --> 19:23.260
And I remember like when I first, first started, I was like, OK, that sounds good.

19:23.260 --> 19:24.260
You'll call it.

19:24.260 --> 19:25.460
So you'll call me tomorrow.

19:25.460 --> 19:26.600
OK, sounds good.

19:26.600 --> 19:31.140
And I take the card and they're like, yeah, Nick, you did such a good job on the presentation.

19:31.140 --> 19:35.260
Like if I can give you a rate or review, I'd love to talk to your manager, Kyle.

19:35.260 --> 19:36.260
How accurate is that?

19:36.260 --> 19:37.260
What?

19:37.260 --> 19:40.180
Like, is that the same thing that you experienced right when you first started?

19:40.180 --> 19:41.180
Yeah.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.180
Yep.

19:42.180 --> 19:43.180
Nonstop.

19:43.300 --> 19:48.460
When we started doing this, like the equivalent would probably be like, well, it sounds good.

19:48.460 --> 19:53.300
So I'm going to talk with the team and I'm going to get back with you.

19:53.300 --> 19:54.300
Right?

19:54.300 --> 19:55.300
Yep.

19:55.300 --> 19:57.180
How many of those deals do you close, dude?

19:57.180 --> 20:01.220
Like, would you say percentage wise, if when somebody says, let me think about it, I'm

20:01.220 --> 20:06.240
going to, I'm going to check the I got to check the numbers, whatever the thing that

20:06.240 --> 20:07.240
comes out.

20:07.240 --> 20:08.240
It's always I want to think about it.

20:08.240 --> 20:10.740
What percentage just letting them right off the hook?

20:10.740 --> 20:13.100
Would you say that you close like you do close some?

20:14.020 --> 20:16.940
Genuinely speaking, if you let everyone off the hook, there's going to be a small percentage

20:16.940 --> 20:17.940
that you do close.

20:17.940 --> 20:19.300
But what do you think that percentage is?

20:19.300 --> 20:20.300
Yeah.

20:20.300 --> 20:21.300
Probably like 5%.

20:21.300 --> 20:22.300
5%.

20:22.300 --> 20:26.300
And you know what the worst part is, is that that 5% ruins you.

20:26.300 --> 20:27.300
Right?

20:27.300 --> 20:29.700
I get you thinking like, oh, that guy came back.

20:29.700 --> 20:30.700
I'm just looking.

20:30.700 --> 20:32.700
I think Sean's on here.

20:32.700 --> 20:38.300
Sean and Gina, I know they're going to comment because they were one of them that ended up

20:38.300 --> 20:39.300
coming back.

20:39.300 --> 20:40.300
But it's very rare.

20:40.500 --> 20:44.620
It's more often they either go here, you know, give you the whole pitch of why they're not

20:44.620 --> 20:45.620
doing it.

20:45.620 --> 20:46.620
100% man.

20:46.620 --> 20:51.620
So there's a book called The Psychology of Selling and it's by Brian Tracy and he talks

20:51.620 --> 20:57.260
about like, whenever we get done with a sale, we think that the prospect just, you know,

20:57.260 --> 21:01.500
we get done off the zoom, Kyle calls me, he's like, hey, they're really excited.

21:01.500 --> 21:06.420
And in our heads, we think that the person, the prospect is over there, you know, just

21:06.540 --> 21:10.820
doing the pros and cons, thinking about joining, thinking about working with us on our lead

21:10.820 --> 21:15.860
gen system, thinking about expanding all of Northwest Arkansas or all of Dallas, Fort

21:15.860 --> 21:17.620
Worth and tree service.

21:17.620 --> 21:21.260
And the reality is, dude, as soon as they hang, the reality is that they already made

21:21.260 --> 21:23.300
up their minds is actually the truth.

21:23.300 --> 21:27.380
But if they haven't, for some weird reason, the second they get off within five minutes,

21:27.380 --> 21:30.300
they know that like what they're going to do or they know what it is on the call.

21:30.300 --> 21:33.860
They're just looking for a reason or how to tell you how to do it.

21:33.860 --> 21:37.100
And so, guys, what you need to understand.

21:37.100 --> 21:40.860
And I'm going to say this like that, I'm going to say this very boldly because I've seen

21:40.860 --> 21:41.860
it so many times.

21:41.860 --> 21:42.860
This is not from theory.

21:42.860 --> 21:43.860
This is not from reading books.

21:43.860 --> 21:48.100
But I promise you, if you guys are just letting people think about it, letting people leave

21:48.100 --> 21:52.940
you with their virtual card or either we're going to call you tomorrow, guys, it is, that

21:52.940 --> 21:57.020
is literally, it is financial suicide, okay?

21:57.020 --> 21:58.820
The prospect is not going to call you back.

21:58.820 --> 22:04.060
The prospect is probably going to text you an hour later, five hours later, 24 hours

22:04.060 --> 22:07.700
later, and they're going to send you some long message of why this isn't a good fit

22:07.700 --> 22:08.700
for them.

22:08.700 --> 22:09.700
They're going to hold off.

22:09.700 --> 22:10.700
Okay?

22:10.700 --> 22:14.460
The other thing that you don't realize is when you let the customer say, I'm going to

22:14.460 --> 22:19.500
think about it, I'm going to get back with you, you are literally relinquishing all control.

22:19.500 --> 22:22.060
You no longer have any control.

22:22.060 --> 22:26.940
All you are now is a puppy dog that's following up with somebody who you're begging for money.

22:26.940 --> 22:27.940
Okay?

22:28.060 --> 22:31.980
So guys, when I started doing door-to-door sales, I kept getting this and I couldn't

22:31.980 --> 22:32.980
figure it out.

22:32.980 --> 22:36.140
I was like, I was not consistent closing.

22:36.140 --> 22:38.460
I'd get to the end of the call and I would just cross my fingers.

22:38.460 --> 22:42.660
I'm like, I would go for the close and if they did it, I was like, oh my gosh, thank

22:42.660 --> 22:43.660
goodness.

22:43.660 --> 22:47.060
If they didn't, then I didn't know what to do.

22:47.060 --> 22:48.380
I tried all kinds of different stuff.

22:48.380 --> 22:49.620
I was listening to Grant Cardone.

22:49.620 --> 22:53.220
I tried to do these hard closing techniques.

22:53.220 --> 22:57.900
And then guys, this is what changed everything for me is one day I was sitting in a training

22:58.860 --> 23:02.020
and we had, I think I've told you guys this before, but we would do a training.

23:02.020 --> 23:06.500
If you didn't sell the day before, you would have to go to this training where basically

23:06.500 --> 23:07.500
you were shamed.

23:07.500 --> 23:09.260
It was called the bagel meeting, right Kyle?

23:09.260 --> 23:12.020
Which the bagel means you didn't sell.

23:12.020 --> 23:16.540
And these bagel meetings, how many people would show up to these things?

23:16.540 --> 23:21.180
I mean, it depended, but the energy was dog crap, right?

23:21.180 --> 23:25.860
It's like all the people who didn't sell, that made no money, it's like imagine you

23:26.020 --> 23:30.620
went all day, you knocked seven hours, eight hours of doors, and then they're like, you

23:30.620 --> 23:33.300
have an extra meeting tomorrow at 10 a.m.

23:33.300 --> 23:36.900
Dude, energy is like terrible.

23:36.900 --> 23:44.780
So I'm in a training meeting one day, a sales training meeting, and our trainer, he proposed

23:44.780 --> 23:49.180
this idea and he's like, I want to teach you guys this.

23:49.180 --> 23:53.100
And he came up with this concept, he's like, I want you guys to have this mindset.

23:53.100 --> 23:57.580
I want you guys to start implementing this thing where you say to people, and maybe whether

23:57.580 --> 24:02.020
it's out loud or in your head, I don't do comebacks.

24:02.020 --> 24:06.220
Or essentially meaning, I don't do, I want to think about it.

24:06.220 --> 24:09.500
And I remember when he said that, I was like, yeah, right, bro.

24:09.500 --> 24:13.100
Like there's no way, like, you know, I can think of all these different excuses.

24:13.100 --> 24:17.060
Like you're asking me at 20, how old were you, Kyle, when he did this, do it in ourselves,

24:17.060 --> 24:18.060
25?

24:18.060 --> 24:19.060
Yeah, 25.

24:19.060 --> 24:21.940
25, I think I was 23, 24.

24:21.980 --> 24:26.860
Like you're asking me to ask 40, 50, 60 year old men, 30 year old men with huge houses,

24:26.860 --> 24:31.220
like they have to make a decision, I don't do comebacks, like it was a really bold idea.

24:31.220 --> 24:34.620
And I was like, there's no way I'm going to be able to do that.

24:34.620 --> 24:39.020
But basically, the idea that he proposed to put in our head is that you get an answer

24:39.020 --> 24:45.860
yes or no on the spot, and you'd rather take a no than you would a maybe, and that you

24:45.860 --> 24:50.380
are bold with the customer and say, I do not do comebacks, okay?

24:50.380 --> 24:55.860
So I know, Kyle, when I told you about this concept, I don't know if it was me, it could

24:55.860 --> 24:58.180
have been one of our other managers.

24:58.180 --> 24:59.820
Did you think that that was a crazy, crazy move?

24:59.820 --> 25:02.980
Do you even remember when we came up with this, or did we just train you like that from

25:02.980 --> 25:03.980
the beginning?

25:03.980 --> 25:04.980
I don't even remember.

25:04.980 --> 25:09.780
Yeah, that was just trained like from the beginning, but it was still a wild idea.

25:09.780 --> 25:12.020
It's the same thing.

25:12.020 --> 25:16.740
You're almost confronting these people and saying you have to be bold with your stuff.

25:16.740 --> 25:17.740
It's hard.

25:17.780 --> 25:21.660
Especially like it's much easier to where we're at.

25:21.660 --> 25:23.860
This is why I'm always like, guys, you don't know how good you have it.

25:23.860 --> 25:27.820
Imagine you go in like a little freaking puppy dog door to door in these big neighborhoods

25:27.820 --> 25:34.420
with these giant houses with, you know, and Kyle, you were driving a Volkswagen Golf diesel

25:34.420 --> 25:35.420
at the time.

25:35.420 --> 25:36.420
You could barely fit in.

25:36.420 --> 25:40.380
I was driving a Honda Civic or a Prius and like we're buzzing around neighborhoods, like,

25:40.380 --> 25:42.860
you know, asking bold questions like this.

25:42.860 --> 25:43.860
It was scary.

25:43.980 --> 25:47.980
I remember when the guy said it, I was like, now I had all the objections in the world

25:47.980 --> 25:48.980
in my head.

25:48.980 --> 25:49.980
I'm like, now he's crazy.

25:49.980 --> 25:53.260
I was like, in my head, I was like, well, what if the customer thinks it's high pressure?

25:53.260 --> 25:54.980
You know, what if they think I'm a sleazy salesman?

25:54.980 --> 25:57.780
What if the customer just says no and I lose the deal?

25:57.780 --> 26:00.100
What if the customer kicks me out of the house?

26:00.100 --> 26:02.380
And what if, what if, what if, what if, right?

26:02.380 --> 26:04.300
These are all the things that you think.

26:04.300 --> 26:09.420
And I remember he's like, if you will make up your mind and just follow this advice,

26:09.420 --> 26:12.300
I promise you, you're going to close way more deals than you're going to lose.

26:12.300 --> 26:14.220
And by the way, you are going to lose some deals.

26:14.220 --> 26:16.820
I'm going to tell you guys right now, you are going to lose some deals doing this.

26:16.820 --> 26:18.020
But guess what?

26:18.020 --> 26:19.940
You're going to lose deals anyway.

26:19.940 --> 26:20.940
You're going to lose deals.

26:20.940 --> 26:22.060
This is sales, man.

26:22.060 --> 26:23.060
You're going to lose deals.

26:23.060 --> 26:26.020
So guys, this advice literally changed my life.

26:26.020 --> 26:28.580
Like straight up literally changed my life.

26:28.580 --> 26:34.220
And from that day, I can remember from that very day, I made the decision, the decision,

26:34.220 --> 26:37.580
the decision, and I, it wasn't perfect at first.

26:37.580 --> 26:41.860
It took me a minute to start implementing, but I was like, I have to change something

26:41.860 --> 26:43.500
because I'm not, I'm not consistent.

26:43.500 --> 26:46.540
I'm not closing deals and therefore I'm not making money.

26:46.540 --> 26:49.980
And so I made the decision that I was going to do everything that I could that whenever

26:49.980 --> 26:55.980
I got in a house at a closing table, the equivalent would be on a zoom call in the middle of a

26:55.980 --> 26:56.980
negotiation.

26:56.980 --> 26:57.980
It is a yes or no.

26:57.980 --> 26:58.980
There is no maybe.

26:58.980 --> 26:59.980
Okay.

26:59.980 --> 27:03.100
If the prospect tells, says, Hey, you know, I'm going to have to think about it.

27:03.100 --> 27:04.380
I'm going to get back to you.

27:04.380 --> 27:06.100
That is a no for me.

27:06.100 --> 27:07.100
Okay.

27:07.100 --> 27:10.700
So, um, so guys, what I want to do today in the training, and I'm going to leave some

27:10.780 --> 27:15.540
time for Q and A at the end, but in the training, I want to convince you as best as I can.

27:15.540 --> 27:16.780
And yes, I do want to convince you.

27:16.780 --> 27:20.380
I'm not going to leave it up to you to, to, to think for yourself.

27:20.380 --> 27:25.660
You don't have to do this, but you're talking to two people that have closed a lot of deals

27:25.660 --> 27:30.340
and we've been, we've, dude, Kyle, we have heard every excuse in the book.

27:30.340 --> 27:35.980
Well, and I was, I was going to say the alternative, if you don't do it and the downside, if you

27:35.980 --> 27:42.980
don't do it is you have this like mentality the next day that you're like, Oh, they told

27:42.980 --> 27:47.940
me to come back about six o'clock and so you don't work as hard because you're like, you're

27:47.940 --> 27:48.940
banking on that.

27:48.940 --> 27:50.340
You're like, Oh, they're going to give me a note.

27:50.340 --> 27:52.660
Then six o'clock rolls around, lights are off.

27:52.660 --> 27:56.700
You see him peeking through the, you know, the thing and that's the same with this.

27:56.700 --> 28:00.700
If you're telling the business owner, like, okay, they're going to think about it.

28:00.700 --> 28:04.700
You're not going to go find another business owner in the meantime, but if you get a no

28:04.700 --> 28:07.700
the next day, you're like, okay, I got to go find someone you're actually working where

28:07.700 --> 28:09.380
you know the answer already.

28:09.380 --> 28:12.860
So that's the problem is it gives you this false sense of hope, which then sets you back

28:12.860 --> 28:13.860
further.

28:13.860 --> 28:14.860
It's such a good point.

28:14.860 --> 28:20.180
I can't tell you how many times I've gone home or let's say selling business owners.

28:20.180 --> 28:26.180
I finished a day, got on two, two closing calls, didn't get it, but you know, the one

28:26.180 --> 28:27.620
was like a nine out of 10.

28:27.620 --> 28:31.540
They just had to check the books, they had to just check the finances and the other one,

28:31.540 --> 28:34.300
he just had to check with his partner really quick.

28:34.300 --> 28:38.300
And in my head, I'm like, I'm not going to say anything, but I should have two deals

28:38.300 --> 28:40.300
by 12, 12 in the morning.

28:40.300 --> 28:42.940
And then, you know, I'll hit the gym and really feel good about myself.

28:42.940 --> 28:47.020
You wake up, first one's a text message that says, hey, we're not going to do it.

28:47.020 --> 28:51.500
Second one says, we're going to hold off till the first of next year or we decided not to

28:51.500 --> 28:52.500
go forward.

28:52.500 --> 28:57.260
And now, like Kyle said, you didn't plan for the day properly.

28:57.260 --> 29:01.340
You didn't have your mindset of like, hey, I got to go scrape, I got to go start over.

29:01.340 --> 29:02.940
I got to go hook a new business owner.

29:03.580 --> 29:05.660
You're sitting there going, I'm probably going to get it.

29:05.660 --> 29:07.860
And it completely, it's a domino effect.

29:07.860 --> 29:11.060
And I'm telling you guys, if you get off the call with somebody and they don't do the deal,

29:11.060 --> 29:14.540
just go ahead and assume that it's a done deal, you're not going to get it.

29:14.540 --> 29:19.220
Just assume that it's not going to happen because 90% of the time, you're not going

29:19.220 --> 29:20.220
to get it.

29:20.220 --> 29:21.220
Okay?

29:21.220 --> 29:25.860
So, my goal in the next 15 minutes is I want to convince you guys that if you'll make up

29:25.860 --> 29:31.220
your mind today that it is either a yes or a no, and then you will be strategic in how

29:31.220 --> 29:34.220
you bring it up, because there is a way to do it right, there is a way to do it wrong.

29:34.220 --> 29:35.220
I've done both, okay?

29:35.220 --> 29:37.380
And I'm going to tell you what not to do.

29:37.380 --> 29:42.140
If you'll do this, make up your mind, and just take a yes or no, you are going to close

29:42.140 --> 29:44.780
way more deals than you're going to lose, okay?

29:44.780 --> 29:48.260
And again, you are going to lose some because it's sales, okay?

29:48.260 --> 29:50.140
So let's just go through this really quick.

29:50.140 --> 29:52.420
I have five things I want to cover, is this.

29:52.420 --> 29:57.820
So for this to be as effective as possible, guys, you have to set this up correctly or

29:58.060 --> 30:03.260
you're just going to look like a slimy car salesman, which I admittedly have done before

30:03.260 --> 30:07.060
because I haven't done this properly and you go in and you just, you don't, it doesn't

30:07.060 --> 30:08.820
come across right, okay?

30:08.820 --> 30:13.900
So number one, guys, you have to set the deal up correctly and you have to leave hints that

30:13.900 --> 30:17.900
make sense why you're asking for the answer today, okay?

30:17.900 --> 30:21.820
So I'm going to give you an example in door to door, I'll give you an example in this

30:21.820 --> 30:25.020
business and then maybe if Kyle can think of one in door to door, I'll let him do it.

30:25.020 --> 30:28.540
If not, I'll, I have one, okay?

30:28.540 --> 30:35.340
In this business, one of the things I like to do is I like to plant the idea up front

30:35.340 --> 30:38.940
to let people know, hey, I'm shopping this around.

30:38.940 --> 30:43.660
I'm sending you leads, Mr. Business Owner, but, and I stole this from Jason Allred recently.

30:43.660 --> 30:47.020
I love this one liner he uses, he says, hey, I'm sending you a couple leads, but I just

30:47.020 --> 30:50.420
want you to know just to be completely upfront with you, I'm not exclusive with just you

30:50.420 --> 30:52.060
yet.

30:52.060 --> 30:54.380
I'm looking for the right partner in this area.

30:54.540 --> 30:57.940
I'm not exclusive with you yet, okay?

30:57.940 --> 31:01.460
So you know, letting them know you're working with other people and I'll throw stuff in

31:01.460 --> 31:06.660
on my screencast, you know, hey, like I said, my goal is to work with the person that's

31:06.660 --> 31:13.540
ready to move, the person that's hungry, and if that ends up being you, first, I want to

31:13.540 --> 31:14.540
work with you.

31:14.540 --> 31:19.860
I want you to, I do want to work with you, but if you're a maybe or I'm not sure, then

31:19.860 --> 31:20.860
I got to move on.

31:20.860 --> 31:24.260
I got ads running, if you want to say that, I've got leads coming in that are going to

31:24.260 --> 31:28.820
waste, but you know, if you bring that up, it makes sense when you get to the end and

31:28.820 --> 31:34.900
you say, hey, like, it's a yes or no for me, I got to have an answer.

31:34.900 --> 31:39.860
Kyle, you just, yesterday, by the way, yesterday, me and Kyle, one of the things, as I said

31:39.860 --> 31:43.420
in the beginning of this call, we're going back to the basics.

31:43.420 --> 31:46.300
We're going back to the things that got us to success in the first place.

31:46.300 --> 31:52.420
So yesterday, Kyle and I went over the sales call that he got on the sales call and we

31:52.420 --> 31:54.180
didn't close it.

31:54.180 --> 32:00.740
And Kyle, you had a really, really good one-liner that completely eliminated the objection of

32:00.740 --> 32:01.740
I want to think about it.

32:01.740 --> 32:02.740
You want to share that, dude?

32:02.740 --> 32:03.740
It was so money.

32:03.740 --> 32:04.740
It was clutch.

32:04.740 --> 32:05.740
I love that.

32:05.740 --> 32:09.540
Oh, I think, was it the hard pressure one?

32:09.540 --> 32:10.540
Yeah.

32:10.540 --> 32:11.540
Yeah.

32:11.540 --> 32:15.540
So I just said, hey, this isn't going to be like a hard pressure, like door to door close.

32:15.540 --> 32:19.300
Like this is really just to make sure you're going to be a good fit.

32:19.300 --> 32:25.060
But with that being said, I am going to ask for a yes or no at the end.

32:25.060 --> 32:27.340
And the guy was like, that sounds fair.

32:27.340 --> 32:31.260
And you got a yes or no, it was a no, but at least you're not sitting there wondering

32:31.260 --> 32:34.180
if it's a maybe, right?

32:34.180 --> 32:37.860
And so, and we went through the pitch, we're going through it again today, but we realized

32:37.860 --> 32:39.700
like that wasn't where he lost the deal.

32:39.700 --> 32:42.620
We lost the deal at a different point that we didn't hit on.

32:42.620 --> 32:45.460
But needless to say, we didn't, at least we got an answer.

32:45.460 --> 32:48.920
And that to me, closure is the best thing in sales, okay?

32:48.960 --> 32:51.960
One of the things we would do in door to door sales is we would let the customer know throughout

32:51.960 --> 32:52.960
the pitch.

32:52.960 --> 32:55.760
Yeah, so we're actually in the neighborhood.

32:55.760 --> 32:58.920
We're here for the summer, but we're here in this specific part of town.

32:58.920 --> 33:01.700
And so what we're doing is we're doing like this group thing where we're going to allow

33:01.700 --> 33:04.460
the technician to come in and install these all at once.

33:04.460 --> 33:07.960
So we don't have to be, you know, driving back and forth, whatever, something that makes

33:07.960 --> 33:10.600
sense where it's like the technician's already in the area.

33:10.600 --> 33:14.800
For those of you that have done sales, it doesn't, you're like, yeah, you can see that

33:14.800 --> 33:17.280
from a mile away that that's complete BS.

33:17.280 --> 33:21.880
But we at least came up with something that sounded like a good reason to say, hey, it's

33:21.880 --> 33:23.880
now or never, okay?

33:23.880 --> 33:26.200
So you got to have a reason.

33:26.200 --> 33:30.400
And to bring it up at the last second, it doesn't work as well.

33:30.400 --> 33:35.080
If you bring it up before and you're like, hey, I'm already working with, I'm looking

33:35.080 --> 33:39.000
at this other guy, I'm going to give you the first chance here because I like you.

33:39.000 --> 33:41.480
But I do want you to know upfront, I want to be completely transparent with you.

33:41.480 --> 33:44.120
I am also talking to another one of your competitors.

33:44.120 --> 33:47.060
I don't feel comfortable sharing the name or I don't care.

33:47.060 --> 33:49.980
You guys can share the name if you want, but I am talking to one of your competitors.

33:49.980 --> 33:51.960
I would love to work with you, right?

33:51.960 --> 33:55.180
So then you get to the end of the call and you can say, hey, I already told you I'm talking

33:55.180 --> 33:56.180
to somebody else.

33:56.180 --> 33:57.180
If you don't want to do it, no problem.

33:57.180 --> 33:58.180
But I'm not taking a maybe.

33:58.180 --> 33:59.820
I'm talking to him today, right?

33:59.820 --> 34:00.820
It's got to make sense.

34:00.820 --> 34:02.500
So number one, guys, you have to set the deal up correctly.

34:02.500 --> 34:06.680
You have to give a reason that when you ask for a yes or no, it makes sense.

34:06.680 --> 34:09.620
You don't sound like a freaking knob, okay?

34:09.620 --> 34:12.180
Secondly, guys, you need to be agreeable.

34:12.180 --> 34:13.860
This is something Kyle's really good at.

34:13.860 --> 34:18.340
So Kyle, like when people are like, hey, I want to think about it.

34:18.340 --> 34:22.780
I need to talk to freaking my goldfish.

34:22.780 --> 34:23.780
You're always really good at this.

34:23.780 --> 34:27.340
What do you say right out the gate before you just go into a freaking objection overcoming

34:27.340 --> 34:28.340
mode?

34:28.340 --> 34:31.740
Yeah, I usually just say like, I agree with them.

34:31.740 --> 34:32.900
Yeah, I get it.

34:32.900 --> 34:35.660
Like it's a decision you got to make.

34:35.660 --> 34:42.180
And then just ask like, typically, it usually is price with anybody, right?

34:43.180 --> 34:44.180
Typically, it's the price.

34:44.180 --> 34:47.100
So it's like, hey, aside from price, like what else do you like?

34:47.100 --> 34:49.420
What are you wanting to think about exactly?

34:49.420 --> 34:51.420
Yeah, 100%.

34:51.420 --> 34:52.420
And I would even add on that.

34:52.420 --> 34:53.620
So that's a really good guy.

34:53.620 --> 34:54.620
Make sure you agree.

34:54.620 --> 34:56.300
Hey, I feel you, man.

34:56.300 --> 34:57.820
I take the pressure off.

34:57.820 --> 34:59.540
I completely understand what you're saying.

34:59.540 --> 35:00.540
I feel you.

35:00.540 --> 35:04.900
And then the next thing, guys, step number three, you have to, like Kyle just said, he

35:04.900 --> 35:05.940
jumped ahead.

35:05.940 --> 35:08.460
You have to tie them down to the objection.

35:08.460 --> 35:12.500
So you need to figure out what it is they actually need to think about.

35:12.500 --> 35:14.300
So I think it can change.

35:14.300 --> 35:15.900
I think price can come up.

35:15.900 --> 35:18.100
It depends on what you're selling.

35:18.100 --> 35:23.620
But I honestly think when selling business owners, I don't get with business owners specifically,

35:23.620 --> 35:27.460
I don't get price as much because I've already gone through the screencast.

35:27.460 --> 35:29.700
I've already showed them the lead value calculator.

35:29.700 --> 35:33.300
And it is an investment that they're making that they're going to make their money back.

35:33.300 --> 35:34.300
But you have to tie it down.

35:34.860 --> 35:40.220
For example, if Kyle was my prospect, I'd say, Kyle, so just really quick, if you don't

35:40.220 --> 35:42.540
mind me asking, I just want to get on the same page as you.

35:42.540 --> 35:45.300
What exactly is it that you want to think about?

35:45.300 --> 35:52.140
Yeah, I mean, I just kind of have this principle that I don't make same day decisions.

35:52.140 --> 35:56.860
It's kind of been the thing that's got me to where I'm at in business.

35:56.860 --> 36:01.700
I want to punch you in the face, Kyle.

36:01.700 --> 36:03.300
That one is the worst.

36:03.300 --> 36:07.820
And it's like, how do you argue with somebody that don't base principles?

36:07.820 --> 36:10.860
OK, so let me ask this.

36:10.860 --> 36:17.580
I'm assuming, Frank, I'll say Kyle, I'm assuming, Kyle, because of that, you got burned at some

36:17.580 --> 36:18.580
point in the past.

36:18.580 --> 36:19.580
And that's the reason why.

36:19.580 --> 36:22.500
Like, is there something that I'm trying to dig a little bit.

36:22.500 --> 36:23.500
So when did you get burned?

36:23.500 --> 36:26.780
And he's going to tell me, well, I bought this car, blah, blah, blah.

36:27.020 --> 36:29.740
So I'm going to say, so what do you think?

36:29.740 --> 36:33.940
Like, obviously, if you were 100% certain about this and you knew that you were going

36:33.940 --> 36:37.180
to get your money back, you were going to grow from this, it was going to be a good

36:37.180 --> 36:40.140
partnership, you weren't worried I was going to scam you, this would be 100%.

36:40.140 --> 36:41.140
Yes, there would be no doubt.

36:41.140 --> 36:46.420
So I guess I'm just trying to figure out there's got to be a question.

36:46.420 --> 36:48.940
I usually don't say there's got to be an objection.

36:48.940 --> 36:51.740
You know, I don't like to put that in their head that they have an objection.

36:51.740 --> 36:54.380
But what's your question, man?

36:55.260 --> 36:59.900
Not to cut you off, but Kyle, you're already paying for Google Ads or you're already paying

36:59.900 --> 37:01.500
for Home Advisor.

37:01.500 --> 37:03.420
You already told me you're sick of them.

37:03.420 --> 37:05.340
You already told me you want to grow this year.

37:05.340 --> 37:08.860
I've already sent you five leads.

37:08.860 --> 37:12.380
One of them you already closed, or if they haven't closed, don't say that.

37:12.380 --> 37:14.260
You already know everything about me.

37:14.260 --> 37:19.740
I've shown you what I've done for my, you know, whatever in the next town over.

37:19.740 --> 37:23.940
So I understand what, and again, I'm saying this because I told you I'm already talking

37:23.940 --> 37:24.940
to somebody else.

37:24.940 --> 37:26.260
I'd like to see if we can make this work.

37:26.260 --> 37:28.940
What is it that you want to think about?

37:28.940 --> 37:30.700
And guys, you got to figure out what it is.

37:30.700 --> 37:35.540
And if you push hard enough or you're strategic enough about like digging, you will get the

37:35.540 --> 37:36.540
answer.

37:36.540 --> 37:42.500
Well, you know, I just got to check because, well, like, yeah, I told you that we're making

37:42.500 --> 37:44.220
30 grand a month.

37:44.220 --> 37:47.340
However, we just had the engine in our car go out.

37:47.340 --> 37:52.340
And guys, what you got to realize, especially with men, Kyle, tell me if I'm wrong, but

37:52.420 --> 37:55.220
especially with men, we're so prideful.

37:55.220 --> 37:59.020
We do not want to for one second tell them, like, I can't afford it.

37:59.020 --> 38:00.020
Right.

38:00.020 --> 38:02.780
Like, who wants to say, yeah, dude, money's tight.

38:02.780 --> 38:05.620
I know I told you I was killing it.

38:05.620 --> 38:09.980
I know my Instagram says I'm killing it, but I actually don't have 10 grand.

38:09.980 --> 38:12.380
I actually don't have a thousand bucks a month.

38:12.380 --> 38:13.380
Right.

38:13.380 --> 38:18.460
And the reality is they're sitting there going, I don't have $500 to run on my credit card.

38:18.460 --> 38:19.460
Right.

38:19.460 --> 38:21.620
So you have to figure out what it is.

38:21.620 --> 38:24.800
If you don't figure out what it is, guys, you're never going to get the deal.

38:24.800 --> 38:29.500
So let's assume, Kyle, I've gotten past your stupid principle, which is just a smokescreen

38:29.500 --> 38:30.500
anyway.

38:30.500 --> 38:34.620
And you told me it's, let's just say it's something else because you don't get priced

38:34.620 --> 38:36.100
as much when you're doing business.

38:36.100 --> 38:42.900
Let's say that you told me, I don't know, what's another one we get all the time.

38:42.900 --> 38:47.620
Let's say you got burned in the past or whatever.

38:47.620 --> 38:51.220
You want to make sure that you want to talk to one of my clients.

38:51.220 --> 38:52.220
Something like that.

38:52.220 --> 38:53.220
Right.

38:53.220 --> 38:56.100
So you got to tie the next thing, guys, you figure out what it is and you got to tie them

38:56.100 --> 38:57.720
down to that objection.

38:57.720 --> 39:02.500
So Kyle, besides wanting to make sure I'm legit, make sure that I'm not like these leads

39:02.500 --> 39:03.500
that I sent you.

39:03.500 --> 39:07.060
I didn't go and like, I don't know, I don't even know where I'd pull them from, but let's

39:07.060 --> 39:11.340
say they're not a couple of my buddies from around town that are fake estimates that you

39:11.340 --> 39:12.340
closed one of them.

39:12.340 --> 39:13.340
Right.

39:13.340 --> 39:15.220
I'm going to make it seem ridiculous.

39:15.220 --> 39:17.900
Besides the fact you want to make sure I'm not a complete scam.

39:17.900 --> 39:20.160
I'm not the Tinder swindler.

39:20.160 --> 39:23.620
Is there anything else that doesn't make sense about this that would stop you from moving

39:23.620 --> 39:24.620
forward today?

39:24.620 --> 39:31.200
And then he'll say, yeah, no, if he says, yes, you need to figure out what it is.

39:31.200 --> 39:33.380
Well, I also this, right.

39:33.380 --> 39:38.400
And you got, and then once you say that, if they say, no, that's it, say, okay, now guys,

39:38.400 --> 39:40.880
we've tied them, we've pushed them into a corner.

39:40.880 --> 39:42.120
We've tied them into a corner.

39:42.120 --> 39:43.880
We call it a tie down, right?

39:43.880 --> 39:44.880
It's the same thing.

39:44.880 --> 39:45.880
You can use the other analogy.

39:45.880 --> 39:48.060
You're in a house in order to close the deal.

39:48.060 --> 39:49.440
You need to completely seal.

39:49.440 --> 39:50.440
You're in a room.

39:50.440 --> 39:51.440
You need to completely seal it.

39:51.440 --> 39:52.440
You have the door.

39:52.440 --> 39:53.440
You have the windows.

39:53.440 --> 39:54.440
You get three, four windows.

39:54.440 --> 39:57.120
And each one of these objections, you need to close all of the windows and doors and

39:57.120 --> 39:59.280
figure out where the leak is.

39:59.280 --> 40:03.080
And if it's that one window that's price, that's it, but you got to make sure everything

40:03.080 --> 40:04.080
else is closed.

40:04.080 --> 40:08.600
Otherwise, as soon as you close the price window, then the freaking, I got to talk to

40:08.600 --> 40:13.760
my goldfish over here or my wife because she's going to get mad at me.

40:13.760 --> 40:14.760
That window opens, right?

40:14.760 --> 40:17.000
You have to tie them down to one objection.

40:17.000 --> 40:18.000
Okay.

40:18.400 --> 40:22.040
Guys, and I was going to say one other thing.

40:22.040 --> 40:28.160
I think it also comes back to like making sure you're qualifying people correctly.

40:28.160 --> 40:32.480
Just because when you said that with the price, it just, you know, business owners, I've had

40:32.480 --> 40:37.000
calls before where I've like, I've been so desperate just to pass off the leads to anybody

40:37.000 --> 40:41.260
because I didn't want him to go to waste that I didn't qualify the business owners correctly.

40:41.260 --> 40:46.920
So then when I got on the zoom call, I'm actually like, dude, this guy is like working out of

40:47.080 --> 40:50.560
It's like him working out of his, you know, garage and like, he doesn't actually have

40:50.560 --> 40:51.560
a legit company.

40:51.560 --> 40:55.040
And so it's like, when I hit him with price, he's like, well, I could give you 250.

40:55.040 --> 40:59.800
It's like, oh, I would have saved myself so much time if I actually would have qualified

40:59.800 --> 41:01.440
him when I was getting him on the hook.

41:01.440 --> 41:04.000
And that's part of the setup, you know.

41:04.000 --> 41:05.000
That's a really good point.

41:05.000 --> 41:09.560
That's, that kind of, that should, that's even before all of this, that's, we're assuming

41:09.560 --> 41:13.440
with what we're talking about today that you've qualified correctly, but if you guys remembered

41:13.440 --> 41:19.440
from my training, usually when you when you're losing the deal, it's usually the step or

41:19.440 --> 41:20.440
two before.

41:20.440 --> 41:24.600
OK, so if you're getting to the end of the call and you're getting this time and time

41:24.600 --> 41:27.920
again, hey, I literally don't have money.

41:27.920 --> 41:31.160
Like I'll show you my bank account and guys, I don't know about you, but I've had people

41:31.160 --> 41:32.440
literally show me their bank account.

41:32.440 --> 41:34.360
They're like, dude, no shame.

41:34.360 --> 41:35.760
There's like seven dollars in there.

41:35.760 --> 41:38.800
I've actually had that happen.

41:38.800 --> 41:39.960
That's a qualification issue.

41:39.960 --> 41:42.360
And no matter any of this stuff you do, you're not going to get around it.

41:42.560 --> 41:44.240
Let's assume you qualify them correctly.

41:44.240 --> 41:45.960
That's a really good point, Kyle.

41:45.960 --> 41:49.760
Once you so just to review, you're going to make sure that you you you make it make sense.

41:49.760 --> 41:52.920
You have something kind of jammed in there that's like, OK, it makes sense.

41:52.920 --> 41:54.720
They ask for the deal.

41:54.720 --> 41:56.860
Number two, you're agreeable.

41:56.860 --> 42:02.040
Number three, you figure out exactly what the objection is and you tie them down.

42:02.040 --> 42:09.400
Then what I like to do and Kyle's really good at this as well is you want to use the neighbors.

42:09.400 --> 42:12.600
You want to use your other customers to close.

42:12.600 --> 42:20.240
OK, it's way better when we say, hey, you remember Fred that I told you about that he

42:20.240 --> 42:22.800
felt the exact same way that you feel.

42:22.800 --> 42:27.720
And he's what he ended up thinking and realizing was this.

42:27.720 --> 42:32.920
That sounds so much better than me coming at you and going, dude, you're stupid.

42:32.920 --> 42:34.760
Why don't you understand this?

42:34.920 --> 42:39.960
They can relate to Fred, who's another business owner that's a client of mine, way more than

42:39.960 --> 42:40.960
they can relate to you.

42:40.960 --> 42:45.560
And again, yesterday, Kyle and I are watching the sales call and he's done this so long,

42:45.560 --> 42:47.280
he weaves in.

42:47.280 --> 42:50.480
Anytime he has an opportunity, he was like, hey, have you heard of this person?

42:50.480 --> 42:51.960
Let me tell you a little bit about them.

42:51.960 --> 42:56.200
So now he's like, by the time the close comes, he's talked about three or four other people

42:56.200 --> 42:58.040
who are already making money.

42:58.040 --> 43:01.280
And he can come back and be like, hey, you remember that person I told you at the beginning?

43:01.280 --> 43:02.320
Let me tell you about them.

43:02.320 --> 43:06.760
When I went to close them, they were not ready to go at all.

43:06.760 --> 43:09.400
They were the same thing as you.

43:09.400 --> 43:11.880
They have a principle of 24 hours, whatever.

43:11.880 --> 43:16.080
So guys, you want to sell through the neighbors, you want to sell to the business owners, and

43:16.080 --> 43:22.920
you want to use them and use their story to explain how they, despite having doubts, were

43:22.920 --> 43:24.320
able to make this decision.

43:24.320 --> 43:25.840
Now, there's a method for this.

43:25.840 --> 43:26.840
It's called feel, felt, found.

43:26.840 --> 43:29.040
We don't have time to go into depth on that.

43:29.040 --> 43:30.960
It's a completely separate training.

43:30.960 --> 43:35.080
But I think inside of the, I'm almost positive, inside of the premium training library, premium

43:35.080 --> 43:38.840
sales training library, for any of you that are paid in full, message Ashley.

43:38.840 --> 43:41.680
If you're paid in full, you'll have access to the premium sales training library.

43:41.680 --> 43:45.440
I think we have a video, maybe even a few, on the feel, felt, found method.

43:45.440 --> 43:47.520
I'm almost 100% positive.

43:47.520 --> 43:50.640
But you're going to sell through the customer, okay?

43:50.640 --> 43:51.640
Example is this.

43:51.640 --> 43:54.640
You know, hey, you remember that guy I told you about, Brooks?

43:54.640 --> 43:56.880
The one I've been working with since 2020?

43:56.880 --> 43:59.400
Funny enough, when he started, it was the exact same thing.

43:59.400 --> 44:02.480
He was actually paying Home Advisor only like 300 bucks.

44:02.480 --> 44:06.580
And for him, he was like having a hard time wrapping his head around tripling the price.

44:06.580 --> 44:10.160
But then when he, what he said to me once we started talking about is he actually realized

44:10.160 --> 44:14.160
that even though he was only paying 300 bucks a month, he was literally competing for every

44:14.160 --> 44:15.260
one of these leads.

44:15.260 --> 44:18.300
He was sharing these leads with three, four, five people.

44:18.300 --> 44:22.440
So for every one of those leads, Home Advisor was actually charging triple.

44:22.440 --> 44:27.280
So it was like, those leads were worth a thousand bucks a month, but he was only paying 300.

44:27.280 --> 44:28.720
And that's why he wasn't closing any.

44:28.760 --> 44:32.320
So for him, he's like, if I can close one deal from these exclusive leads, it makes

44:32.320 --> 44:33.320
sense.

44:33.320 --> 44:34.880
And that's why he decided to move forward.

44:34.880 --> 44:36.760
Whatever it is, I would try to be more succinct than that.

44:36.760 --> 44:38.800
I'm just coming up with something on the spot.

44:38.800 --> 44:44.000
But use other people, other business owners, other deals that you've done, or other deals

44:44.000 --> 44:47.960
that people have done inside of this group, if you don't have any deals yet, to go ahead

44:47.960 --> 44:51.960
and overcome that objection that they have.

44:51.960 --> 44:55.540
And then from there, guys, you can go back for the close, okay?

44:55.540 --> 45:02.420
And so, guys, I'm telling you, if you will do this, and I'm going to end with one last

45:02.420 --> 45:08.460
thing where you need to go for the close again, but if you guys will just make up your mind

45:08.460 --> 45:13.540
to do a yes or no on every single call, you are going to close way more deals.

45:13.540 --> 45:16.100
What it is, guys, think about it like this, you get to the end of the call, you have a

45:16.100 --> 45:18.060
business owner that's sitting on the fence, right?

45:18.060 --> 45:20.420
They could go yes, they could go no.

45:20.420 --> 45:24.420
And I'm telling you, if you walk away from the deal, leaving them sitting on the fence,

45:24.420 --> 45:27.780
the majority of them are going to tip on the side of no.

45:27.780 --> 45:31.580
If you will be bold, if you will ask for an answer, if you will ask for a yes or no on

45:31.580 --> 45:37.980
the call, you are going to tip a percentage of them that are leaning your way, you're

45:37.980 --> 45:40.020
going to tip them on your side.

45:40.020 --> 45:42.220
That nudge is going to get them on your side.

45:42.220 --> 45:50.420
Kyle, we had a call, I was in Africa, what was this, two, three weeks ago, Kyle was on

45:50.420 --> 45:51.420
a call.

45:51.420 --> 45:58.300
We had an individual that was super interested and their objection was, were they about

45:58.300 --> 46:00.700
to start school or something, you remember this?

46:00.700 --> 46:04.500
I'm drawing a blank on who that was.

46:04.500 --> 46:07.140
This person was about to start school, they were super interested and everything made

46:07.140 --> 46:08.380
sense, blah, blah, blah.

46:08.380 --> 46:13.820
I hopped on the call and basically reiterated what Kyle said, I'm like, hey, the reality

46:13.820 --> 46:18.100
is because this person was like, I want to get to the new place, I want to get settled

46:18.100 --> 46:19.900
and I'm going to have a better idea of my time.

46:19.900 --> 46:27.100
I basically said to him, we tied him down and I said something to the extent of, here's

46:27.100 --> 46:31.100
the reality, man, if we hang up this call, you already know the decision, whether you

46:31.100 --> 46:35.260
get down there today, tomorrow, whatever, if you want to make this work, you're going

46:35.260 --> 46:36.260
to make it work.

46:36.260 --> 46:39.900
I don't know what your situation is going to look like, but I can tell you that if you

46:39.900 --> 46:42.620
want to make this work, you are going to make it work because I've seen tons of other people

46:42.620 --> 46:43.620
do it.

46:43.620 --> 46:45.140
So let's do this.

46:45.140 --> 46:49.260
I think what we ended up saying, we didn't even ask, we're like, I'm going to take a

46:49.580 --> 46:54.500
thousand bucks down, the rest is going to be next week on this day and we're going to

46:54.500 --> 46:55.500
get you going today.

46:55.500 --> 46:57.820
And do you remember the guys like, okay, I think we can do that.

46:57.820 --> 47:00.860
Do you remember what I'm talking about now?

47:00.860 --> 47:01.860
Probably not because you do so many calls.

47:01.860 --> 47:06.820
But anyway, I remember that call and all it took was like, hey, we're not doing that.

47:06.820 --> 47:11.500
And if it's a no, if it's a I want to think about it, you're not our guy.

47:11.500 --> 47:16.980
I want business owners that are like, and guys, it's true, man, business owners that

47:16.980 --> 47:20.980
can make a fricking decision are business owners you want to work with, right?

47:20.980 --> 47:26.140
If they're hum-hum around with you, they're not going to be closing fricking people that

47:26.140 --> 47:28.260
want, that want their concrete services.

47:28.260 --> 47:32.700
They're going to believe their stupid objections to a good salesperson is also somebody that's

47:32.700 --> 47:35.540
confident in making a decision, okay?

47:35.540 --> 47:38.620
The better I've gotten at sales, the easier it is for me to go and buy something on the

47:38.620 --> 47:39.620
spot.

47:39.620 --> 47:42.740
The easier it is for me to make a decision on, on whatever it is, whether it's a $20,000

47:42.740 --> 47:49.500
program, whether it's buying a $220,000 G-Wagon off the lot without talking to my spouse.

47:49.500 --> 47:53.420
I don't care because I'm like, I'm confident in making that decision because I know I can

47:53.420 --> 47:57.620
go and make the money back or I can take the knowledge and make the money from that thing.

47:57.620 --> 48:03.340
Okay, so just to review, you to make this effective, you have to put something in there

48:03.340 --> 48:04.900
that makes sense, okay?

48:04.900 --> 48:06.500
We're talking to other business owners.

48:06.500 --> 48:08.380
Step number two, you have to be agreeable.

48:08.380 --> 48:10.420
Step number three, you got to figure out what the objection is.

48:10.420 --> 48:12.420
You got to tie them down, okay?

48:13.100 --> 48:14.100
Step number four, you're going to use the neighbors.

48:14.100 --> 48:17.340
You're going to use the neighbors meaning the customers, your other customers that you've

48:17.340 --> 48:18.500
sold before.

48:18.500 --> 48:21.740
And step number five, guys, is you're going to go back for the close, okay?

48:21.740 --> 48:27.260
And you're going to say something like, so Brooks, like, or Bob, Kyle, like I told you,

48:27.260 --> 48:29.460
you're in the exact same situation as him.

48:29.460 --> 48:30.460
Nothing's going to change.

48:30.460 --> 48:32.500
If I get off this call, the only thing that's going to change is I'm going to be going and

48:32.500 --> 48:35.680
working with your competitor, which I don't want to see happen.

48:35.680 --> 48:37.160
Everything makes sense.

48:37.160 --> 48:38.500
You told me you want to grow.

48:38.500 --> 48:42.240
You told me that you close at this percentage with this profit margin in this.

48:43.060 --> 48:44.220
We did the numbers in the lead value calculator.

48:44.220 --> 48:45.720
Price is not an issue.

48:45.720 --> 48:48.400
There's nothing that's going to change from now to tomorrow.

48:48.400 --> 48:49.400
Let's do this deal, man.

48:49.400 --> 48:51.000
What, you want to put the Amex or Visa on file?

48:51.000 --> 48:52.000
Let's do this, right?

48:52.000 --> 48:53.880
And it doesn't have to be that bold.

48:53.880 --> 48:54.880
You could say something else.

48:54.880 --> 48:58.360
Kyle, how do you go back for the close after you've tried to do it and then you do it again?

48:58.360 --> 48:59.360
What's your go-to?

48:59.360 --> 49:04.360
I don't know.

49:04.360 --> 49:07.760
It usually actually just kind of falls in place.

49:07.760 --> 49:11.080
Like once you've kind of been like, well, you know, because even with the business owners,

49:11.080 --> 49:14.320
you can be like, well, let's just do like a weekly deal, like a weekly payment.

49:14.320 --> 49:15.320
Yeah.

49:15.320 --> 49:20.160
So instead of like, yeah, fifteen hundred bucks a month, let's just do, you know, whatever

49:20.160 --> 49:24.640
that is, two seventy five a week or three seventy five, whatever that comes out to.

49:24.640 --> 49:30.480
And so almost a different like Amex or Visa, but like, OK, let's just do weekly versus

49:30.480 --> 49:31.480
monthly.

49:31.480 --> 49:35.880
But usually once you talk to them, usually they're just like, yeah, that makes sense.

49:35.880 --> 49:36.880
Like let's just do it.

49:36.880 --> 49:37.880
Yeah.

49:38.680 --> 49:41.520
Kyle, you're using an assumption close just by doing it.

49:41.520 --> 49:45.880
So Kyle, what he's saying, he's like, OK, so besides price, well, let's make this easy.

49:45.880 --> 49:46.880
You said price.

49:46.880 --> 49:48.480
And then when it comes to price, you want to dig in a little.

49:48.480 --> 49:51.720
Are you talking about the, you know, the whatever?

49:51.720 --> 49:53.600
I'm guessing the monthly chunk kind of scares you.

49:53.600 --> 49:54.600
Let's make it easy.

49:54.600 --> 49:55.600
I'll take this.

49:55.600 --> 49:56.600
I'll split it up into four payments.

49:56.600 --> 49:57.600
And then that's the way it's more digestible.

49:57.600 --> 49:58.600
Sound fair?

49:58.600 --> 49:59.600
Boom.

49:59.600 --> 50:00.600
Done.

50:00.600 --> 50:01.600
You got it.

50:01.600 --> 50:02.600
That's the steps, guys.

50:02.920 --> 50:11.480
The last thing I want to say is if they still are sitting there hum, hon, whatever, I would

50:11.480 --> 50:15.360
say something to this extent, OK, this is something that I would use again and again

50:15.360 --> 50:16.360
and again.

50:16.360 --> 50:17.360
I would say something to the extent of this.

50:17.360 --> 50:18.360
Look, sir.

50:18.360 --> 50:21.680
Look, ma'am, I've been doing this a long time.

50:21.680 --> 50:25.760
You've already told me you're unhappy with HomeAdvisor or Google Ads.

50:25.760 --> 50:30.760
You told me you're interested in growing and you love the exclusivity of what I'm offering.

50:31.240 --> 50:36.600
You said you've seen what I've done for Joe, for Jack, for Brooks, whatever.

50:36.600 --> 50:39.240
And on top of that, I've sent you three leads for free.

50:39.240 --> 50:41.400
And no disrespect, Kyle.

50:41.400 --> 50:47.220
But if it doesn't make sense at this point and you're still like a maybe, I respectfully

50:47.220 --> 50:51.400
I want to retract my offer, I'm a no.

50:51.400 --> 50:53.980
Bold statements.

50:53.980 --> 50:57.000
And you just be quiet.

50:57.000 --> 50:58.000
And why do you do that, Kyle?

50:58.240 --> 51:00.800
Explain what the psychology is behind that.

51:00.800 --> 51:03.480
It basically just gets them thinking.

51:03.480 --> 51:08.280
It's kind of the first person who speaks loses kind of deal, but it just makes them actually

51:08.280 --> 51:12.680
make a decision instead of you jumping in and being like, oh, well, if you don't and

51:12.680 --> 51:14.000
then it gives them an out.

51:14.000 --> 51:16.640
So it basically takes the out away.

51:16.640 --> 51:20.040
So if you go through all those steps and they're still like, hey, I still got to think about

51:20.040 --> 51:22.560
it, then you got to go and you got to say what I just said.

51:22.560 --> 51:24.840
And what you're doing, guys, is you're taking the control back.

51:24.840 --> 51:29.360
You're like, OK, well, you know, if you're going to break up with me, by golly, I'm going

51:29.360 --> 51:31.000
to be the first one to break up with you.

51:31.000 --> 51:32.000
And you're like, you know what?

51:32.000 --> 51:34.160
If you're a maybe, you're not my guy.

51:34.160 --> 51:37.520
And the reason, guys, if you do that, what you're doing is you're taking the control

51:37.520 --> 51:38.520
back.

51:38.520 --> 51:43.440
But also, if they are actually this is the psychology.

51:43.440 --> 51:49.680
If they were going to do it tonight or tomorrow or in three days, if you take the deal away,

51:49.680 --> 51:54.560
if they were actually going to do it, if you retract the deal, I promise you they're going

51:54.560 --> 51:57.000
to come with you.

51:57.000 --> 51:58.000
And guess what?

51:58.000 --> 52:00.240
The people that were never going to do it, you know what they're going to do?

52:00.240 --> 52:01.240
That's the perfect out.

52:01.240 --> 52:05.560
They're going to say, well, I guess I guess that's fair.

52:05.560 --> 52:06.560
I had this happen yesterday.

52:06.560 --> 52:12.160
We had a business owner, me and Francesca did this this proposal and they were hum-hum.

52:12.160 --> 52:15.600
It was the sister that kiboshed the deal, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

52:15.600 --> 52:17.320
And finally, we were like, what should we do?

52:17.320 --> 52:18.320
Should we try to hit him with something?

52:18.320 --> 52:19.320
Get back on the phone.

52:19.320 --> 52:20.320
I said, you know what?

52:20.320 --> 52:24.080
Let's just see where they're actually at, because I was like, I don't think it's going

52:24.080 --> 52:25.080
to work anywhere.

52:25.080 --> 52:26.080
So you know what I did?

52:26.080 --> 52:27.080
I did exactly that.

52:27.080 --> 52:32.720
I did it over a text because it was just the situation and I sent him a text.

52:32.720 --> 52:33.720
I said, hey, whatever.

52:33.720 --> 52:35.280
I think his name was Brandon.

52:35.280 --> 52:39.000
I said, Brandon, no offense, but we've been going back and forth.

52:39.000 --> 52:40.640
It's like our third time doing this.

52:40.640 --> 52:44.520
I feel like you're on board, but your sister, every time we talk to her, she just kills

52:44.520 --> 52:45.520
the deal.

52:45.520 --> 52:48.600
I said, respectfully, we're going to retract our offer.

52:48.600 --> 52:49.920
And you know what he said?

52:49.920 --> 52:51.280
He didn't say, okay, let's do it.

52:51.280 --> 52:53.080
He said, I think that sounds fair.

52:53.080 --> 52:54.240
Sorry, it couldn't work out.

52:54.240 --> 52:55.720
The dude was never going to do it.

52:55.720 --> 52:58.280
Imagine if we had been sitting there thinking, oh, this guy's going to call us and think

52:58.280 --> 52:59.280
about it.

52:59.280 --> 53:00.280
They're not going to do that, guys.

53:00.280 --> 53:05.320
So if you get to the end, you go through the steps and they still are a maybe, you need

53:05.320 --> 53:06.320
to withdraw.

53:06.320 --> 53:07.320
You need to retract the offer.

53:07.320 --> 53:11.440
I'm going to say that one more time, ma'am, sir, Kyle, look, I've been doing this a long

53:11.440 --> 53:12.440
time.

53:12.440 --> 53:13.440
Okay.

53:13.440 --> 53:16.360
I've already, you've already told me you're unhappy with home advisor or whoever.

53:16.360 --> 53:17.960
You told me you're interested in growing.

53:17.960 --> 53:20.360
You told me you love the exclusivity of what I'm doing.

53:20.360 --> 53:21.680
You've seen what I can do.

53:21.680 --> 53:23.040
You've seen it with these other people.

53:23.040 --> 53:27.600
I've shown you other projects I've done, and I've already sent you three leads for absolutely

53:27.600 --> 53:28.600
free.

53:28.600 --> 53:29.600
Have you had anyone else do that for you?

53:29.600 --> 53:30.760
I don't think so.

53:30.760 --> 53:34.840
At this point, if it still doesn't make sense, if you're still a maybe, I just don't think

53:34.840 --> 53:36.120
this is going to be a good fit.

53:36.120 --> 53:39.120
I want somebody that's confident in making a decision and wants to work.

53:39.120 --> 53:42.640
You've told me everything that you're ready to go, but now you're hesitating.

53:42.640 --> 53:48.880
Respectfully, if you can't say yes now, I think I'm going to have to go look elsewhere.

53:48.880 --> 53:51.340
And it's scary the first time you say it.

53:51.340 --> 53:56.140
But if they are on the fence leaning your direction, you're going to tip 90% of them.

53:56.140 --> 54:00.900
And if you lose the deal right there, you are never going to get them anyway.

54:00.900 --> 54:06.540
But what you've done is you've saved yourself an entire 24 hours, 48 hours, maybe a week

54:06.540 --> 54:09.220
time thinking you're going to get a deal that you're not going to get.

54:09.220 --> 54:12.660
You can wake up, you can get off the call, get pissed off for a second, go hook another

54:12.660 --> 54:14.380
business owner and write that person off.

54:14.380 --> 54:15.660
And I'm not saying to end it on a bad note.

54:15.660 --> 54:17.100
I'm saying burn a bridge.

54:17.100 --> 54:20.060
I'm saying retract the offer and move on.

54:20.700 --> 54:22.380
Kyle, anything else I missed?

54:22.380 --> 54:25.900
Well, one thing I was thinking about as you were talking that you do really well that

54:25.900 --> 54:32.460
I don't do as well is calling people out on things that they've said.

54:32.460 --> 54:37.540
So like with digital landlords, of course, we have it like, hey, can you make a decision

54:37.540 --> 54:39.100
in the application?

54:39.100 --> 54:40.900
And then we say that on the call.

54:40.900 --> 54:43.580
And then when we get to the end, they're like, well, I got to make it, you know, I got to

54:43.580 --> 54:44.580
think about it.

54:44.580 --> 54:47.180
And I don't do as well as just calling them out on their bullshit and you do a really

54:47.180 --> 54:48.180
good job.

54:48.220 --> 54:51.460
Same thing with the business owners, like sometimes it's uncomfortable to call them

54:51.460 --> 54:54.060
out when at the beginning, they're like, yeah, I'm hungry.

54:54.060 --> 54:55.820
I'm looking to grow all this.

54:55.820 --> 54:58.780
And then they get to the end, they're like, well, kind of hum-hulling.

54:58.780 --> 55:02.300
Like that's when you can come back and be like, well, earlier you said you were hungry

55:02.300 --> 55:03.300
to grow.

55:03.300 --> 55:05.780
Like, were you just saying that just because it sounded cool or what?

55:05.780 --> 55:08.020
That's something that it takes a little bit.

55:08.020 --> 55:10.420
You're a lot more bold on that kind of stuff than I am.

55:10.420 --> 55:13.740
But, you know, that's one thing tying them back to what they've said.

55:13.740 --> 55:16.700
Yeah, we were going through the call yesterday.

55:16.700 --> 55:23.900
And I think the person that we were, the call that we were reviewing early in the call,

55:23.900 --> 55:29.580
the person said something like, I don't want to waste a bunch of time trying this on my

55:29.580 --> 55:30.580
own.

55:30.580 --> 55:31.580
Right?

55:31.580 --> 55:33.820
I don't want to waste two years trying this on my own.

55:33.820 --> 55:36.460
We get to the end of the call, or Kyle gets to the end of the call, and the guy's like,

55:36.460 --> 55:39.660
he goes, well, I haven't really tried this on my own yet.

55:39.660 --> 55:45.020
And it's like, well, you numb nuts, you said you weren't going to, you said you didn't

55:45.020 --> 55:46.020
want to waste two years.

55:46.020 --> 55:47.660
So now you want to waste two years.

55:47.660 --> 55:48.660
Right?

55:48.660 --> 55:49.660
And I get it.

55:49.660 --> 55:50.660
It's uncomfortable.

55:50.660 --> 55:53.540
But I promise you guys, you're not here to make friends.

55:53.540 --> 55:55.260
You're not here to make friends with your business owners.

55:55.260 --> 55:58.340
You can become friends, but you want them to respect you.

55:58.340 --> 55:59.340
You're here to make them money.

55:59.340 --> 56:03.020
If you can make them money, you will become lifelong friends.

56:03.020 --> 56:04.020
Okay?

56:04.020 --> 56:08.020
But letting them roll over you, not holding them to what they said, that's not going,

56:08.020 --> 56:09.020
they're not going to respect you.

56:09.020 --> 56:10.740
They're just, they're bulldozing you.

56:10.740 --> 56:11.740
Okay?

56:12.460 --> 56:16.220
And I'm not a big fan of the Cardone, hard close, blah, blah, blah, but I'm telling

56:16.220 --> 56:18.940
you guys, this is how I want to end.

56:18.940 --> 56:23.580
If you'll make up your mind today that you are no longer taking a maybe, it's a yes or

56:23.580 --> 56:28.100
a no, I promise you, you will close more deals than you will lose.

56:28.100 --> 56:29.100
100%.

56:29.100 --> 56:30.100
Guys, there's a bunch of comments.

56:30.100 --> 56:31.100
I apologize.

56:31.100 --> 56:32.100
We couldn't get to them.

56:32.100 --> 56:33.100
We were just ripping.

56:33.100 --> 56:34.100
We're going.

56:34.100 --> 56:35.100
Kyle, let's close some deals this week.

56:35.100 --> 56:36.100
Guys, appreciate you being on.

56:36.100 --> 56:39.100
We'll be on next Tuesday live, and we'll see you guys then.

56:39.100 --> 56:39.660
Bye.
