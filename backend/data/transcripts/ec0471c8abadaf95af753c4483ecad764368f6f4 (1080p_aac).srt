00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,520
Cody says, what about the ones that refuse to do Zoom

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:05,440
or don't know how, what do you mean?

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:08,040
Like, it's not, I don't give them an option, Cody.

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:12,240
I just say, hey man, let's do a Zoom.

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,320
We're gonna be doing a Zoom.

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,000
And they're like, oh, I just wanna talk on the phone.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,760
That's not how it roll, that's not how I roll.

8
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,640
I want you to see my face.

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,000
I wanna like know who you are.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,080
If I'm gonna work with you, I wanna see who you are

11
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,480
and I wanna talk to you on a Zoom call.

12
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,920
It's really hard.

13
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,280
You see, I'm gonna send you this link.

14
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,280
It's gonna be a text and you're gonna push,

15
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,000
it's gotta underline, you know what that is, right?

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,960
Push that and you should be good to go, okay?

17
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,360
Maybe you tell them to download Zoom, whatever.

18
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,220
It's not an option, okay?

19
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:40,520
Cody, answer your question.
