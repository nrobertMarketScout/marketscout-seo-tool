00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,520
have leads coming in, have seven business owners running Google ads, but none of them picking up

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,920
the phone. Daniel Kong, that's an interesting challenge. Here's a couple of suggestions.

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:18,480
Get a Google voice number. Use a call rail number. Try star six seven. Just do all kinds of different

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:25,120
things that you can do to get them to pick up the phone. Try sending them a text. Hey, I got this

5
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,720
job. I could say, I don't know, just try different things. If you can't get any of them to pick up,

6
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,440
that seems very, very interesting and very, very weird. But I would try a couple of those things

7
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,120
first, guys. We just got to get that attention, get them to answer. We've got to have a chance

8
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,320
at it. Of course, worst case scenario, you could always send an email. It's my least favorite option,

9
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,720
but yeah, you could always try a text message. Just don't give too much information away. We

10
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,760
got to give a reason for them to call you back.
