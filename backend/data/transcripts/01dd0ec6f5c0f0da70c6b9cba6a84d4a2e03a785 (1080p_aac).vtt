00:00.000 --> 00:08.120
He or she who cares the least or he or she who appears to care the least or seems or

00:08.120 --> 00:14.160
appears to seem like they're the most willing to walk away is the person that has control.

00:14.160 --> 00:17.960
And if you're out of control in a deal, you're not going to get the deal.

00:17.960 --> 00:20.840
And so if you're sitting there right now and you have a deal where someone's going to call

00:20.840 --> 00:23.120
you back, it's time for the pullback.

00:23.120 --> 00:26.560
If you're sitting there right now with a business owner who's not answering your calls, it's

00:26.560 --> 00:27.560
time for the pullback.

00:27.800 --> 00:32.360
If you're sitting there in a relationship and you have zero control, it's time to be

00:32.360 --> 00:33.120
willing to walk.

00:33.120 --> 00:40.240
OK, the person he or she who cares the least or appears to care the least has the control.

00:40.240 --> 00:43.680
OK, and this game is about doing deals.

00:43.680 --> 00:46.800
And when you want to if you want to get deals, you need to have control.

00:46.800 --> 00:47.760
OK, that's it.

00:47.760 --> 00:48.600
That's the pullback.
