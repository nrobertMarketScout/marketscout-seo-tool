WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.300
Alright guys, I appreciate you being on, welcome to the call, we're gonna jump right back in.

00:06.300 --> 00:12.820
I wasn't recording but now I am. Porter was just explaining about how he's trying to double

00:12.820 --> 00:17.400
dip on one of his business owners that's already buying Concrete Leads for him, from him. This

00:17.400 --> 00:25.520
is a really good hack for anybody that has multiple clients and the easiest place to

00:25.520 --> 00:33.160
get new money or to get more money is to get money from your current business owner. And

00:33.160 --> 00:37.640
I always used to hear this term about second money, third money, fourth money and I was

00:37.640 --> 00:40.720
a little bit confused because I thought with second money, third money, fourth money you

00:40.720 --> 00:46.720
had to go and you had to get it from, let's say you are getting lead generation money.

00:46.720 --> 00:49.960
Second money in my mind was you go and get their SEO, that'd be second money, then you

00:49.960 --> 00:55.480
go get their social media. But I also think second money is when you go and there's a

00:56.040 --> 00:59.880
lot of these business owners run multiple companies, they're doing multiple services

00:59.880 --> 01:06.520
because they have shiny object syndrome. So there's that, but more often what you'll see

01:06.520 --> 01:13.720
is you'll find opportunities to get deals in neighboring cities. And so yesterday I

01:13.720 --> 01:18.880
was talking to Jason, me and Jason and Porter were on Zoom and he pointed something out

01:18.880 --> 01:25.880
that I knew, but I didn't realize exactly how, he said it really well. The thing about

01:25.880 --> 01:34.480
the eastern United States, it seems like more in the east you find cities that aren't just

01:34.480 --> 01:42.160
one big city and then a bunch of tiny little suburbs. You find a lot more smaller cities.

01:42.160 --> 01:46.440
And that's what's nice about the east coast. So to give you an example, let's talk about

01:46.440 --> 01:51.160
North Carolina. North Carolina you have Charlotte, that's a big city, but you also have just

01:51.160 --> 01:58.640
north of it, you have Winston-Salem, you have, what else do you have, you have Greensboro

01:58.640 --> 02:04.520
and you have Raleigh, I believe it is. And so those are three, and those aren't huge

02:04.520 --> 02:10.240
cities, but you have opportunities and most businesses would cover all three. Probably

02:10.240 --> 02:13.720
not Charlotte, but they might cover the other three. So that's one thing to think about

02:13.800 --> 02:18.720
when you're starting to look at areas, guys, is looking at areas, yes, when you get your

02:18.720 --> 02:23.120
first deal sometimes you just want to find that one that's close to home or whatever,

02:23.120 --> 02:29.480
but if you can be strategic and find cities where there's more than one opportunity going

02:29.480 --> 02:35.160
forward, you can, you're literally setting yourself up to get easy second, third and

02:35.160 --> 02:41.560
fourth money. So right now it's December 10th, leads are going to be harder to come by, business

02:41.640 --> 02:45.280
owners are going to be a little bit less motivated to work. I mean, if it's hard for us to get

02:45.280 --> 02:49.640
out of bed, to go from the bed to put a beanie on, to come to the office, it's going to

02:49.640 --> 02:55.000
be pretty tough for Bob to get in his truck and do some actual work. But right now is

02:55.000 --> 03:01.700
a good time for you guys to go and get second money, third money, fourth money, et cetera.

03:01.700 --> 03:05.840
So Porter, really good strategy, it's easy, they already trust you, they already know

03:05.840 --> 03:11.040
you, I can't tell you, I've done this so many times, not as many times with a different

03:11.040 --> 03:14.840
service, although I have done that, but a lot of times with the same service inside

03:14.840 --> 03:20.560
of a different city. So how did you actually discover, by the way, that he did fencing?

03:20.560 --> 03:26.240
Well, I remember last year, it was actually a little bit slower. It was seriously about

03:26.240 --> 03:30.120
this time of year and he's like, and I was trying to prep him because I had lost business

03:30.120 --> 03:33.240
owners at this point. So I was like, yeah, like the leads are going to be a little bit

03:33.240 --> 03:36.480
slower in December. And he's like, yeah, he's like, we've been staying busy with, so he

03:36.480 --> 03:40.280
kind of was like, yeah, well, we're okay. Like I expected that, like we're doing fencing,

03:40.280 --> 03:44.720
we're doing, you know, we're still doing concrete jobs or whatever. So we kind of like mentioned

03:44.720 --> 03:47.520
it, but I was like, huh, that's interesting. But it's always been in the back of my mind

03:47.520 --> 03:52.840
to do it. But I was always hesitant because I was like, gosh dang, I don't want to, you

03:52.840 --> 03:56.200
know, do all this work and not work out, you know, so I was always nervous, but I was like,

03:56.200 --> 04:00.000
I don't know why I don't just try it. And after losing those two deals, I'm like, gosh,

04:00.000 --> 04:03.120
the leads have been a little bit slow for the niches that I've been going after in the

04:03.120 --> 04:07.760
area. So I'm like, let me just see if I can just get a quick, you know, quick deal. Cause

04:07.800 --> 04:10.960
this guy's awesome. He, and he's like, yeah, just let me know how much it would cost. He's

04:10.960 --> 04:15.640
like, I, I've been getting fencing jobs, like on his business card, he says he does fencing.

04:15.640 --> 04:19.240
So every time he does like a concrete job or whatever, he'll give him his business card

04:19.240 --> 04:23.560
and it says fencing. So he's got like three or four jobs already, just like doing fencing

04:23.560 --> 04:27.240
jobs. So he's like, yeah, if you can get them to me, he says, yeah, I mean, I'll get it.

04:27.240 --> 04:28.240
I'll get a crew together.

04:30.240 --> 04:34.400
Well, there you go. So just like guys, go to your business owners that you, that you're

04:34.440 --> 04:37.960
doing a great job for, and they will spend second money with you, third money, fourth

04:37.960 --> 04:42.920
money. I don't recommend you to necessarily go and get money in different services. Although

04:42.920 --> 04:49.200
if you do that, I wouldn't do the work yourself. Like if you have a strategic partnership set

04:49.200 --> 04:54.400
up where you can take an SEO deal, for example, send it to somebody, they'll give you, you

04:54.400 --> 05:01.040
know, 50% at least of the deal and you don't have to do the work. That's great. But again,

05:01.040 --> 05:05.600
I think it's easier to get another lead gen deal. So anyway, that said, that's a really

05:05.600 --> 05:12.000
good strategy. The other thing, guys, is just to put in a plug and to remind you guys, just

05:12.000 --> 05:16.840
like the fact that we have rank and rent engine and we can do due diligence with rank and

05:16.840 --> 05:23.960
rent engine, it's saving you so much freaking time. I, I just, I don't even know how many

05:23.960 --> 05:30.400
hours I have spent in my life doing freaking due diligence and doing it by hand, doing

05:30.560 --> 05:35.160
it on a Google sheet, whatever. And now we can literally go in. All you got to do is

05:35.160 --> 05:40.320
you got to find the competitors really quick. Boom, you push one button and it's calculated

05:40.320 --> 05:45.320
in two minutes. And if you guys haven't used it, Porter, you've, have you done due diligence

05:45.320 --> 05:47.240
yet with rank and rent engine?

05:47.760 --> 05:52.160
Yeah, it's so, I was so surprised. I was expecting to have to get out white sparks and

05:52.320 --> 05:55.560
we can look at my, my citations.

05:55.720 --> 06:00.720
And the beautiful part is the, the, the backlink tool is getting beefed up where you're

06:00.720 --> 06:04.760
gonna be able to, you know, take a deeper dive into the backlinks. But guys, real quick,

06:04.760 --> 06:07.400
if you are, I want to just share this little nugget really quick and then we're going to

06:07.400 --> 06:13.160
get in to what the topic is today. But it's very, very easy. What I do is I have my keyword

06:13.160 --> 06:19.400
list, I have rank and rent engine open. And then what I do is I just go clear a browser,

06:19.440 --> 06:23.800
whatever, incognito mode, I have my five to seven keywords, I type them out, I add the

06:23.800 --> 06:28.440
city at the end, boom, boom, boom, push for search on all five to seven searches. And

06:28.440 --> 06:32.120
then I flip through really quick and I look at, you know, now I'm just taking a peek at

06:32.120 --> 06:36.200
the organic. I don't pay as much attention to the maps, but I'm looking who's the top

06:36.240 --> 06:41.240
organic person and do they show up on all five websites? If they do, or at least three

06:41.240 --> 06:45.720
to five, three to five, if they do check the box, boom, I'm grabbing the domain, I'm putting

06:45.720 --> 06:50.880
it in rank and rent engine. I'm doing this for the top three competitors. And I try to

06:50.880 --> 06:56.200
exclude usually the big national players, the not the Zillow, the home advisor, the

06:56.200 --> 07:01.080
Angie's List, that kind of stuff. I'm looking for the local people. And you put it in there,

07:01.080 --> 07:08.080
the three websites, you push the one button, beep, and literally, it's calculated and it's

07:08.080 --> 07:13.160
done. It's frickin ridiculous. So if you're sitting there and you guys are like waiting

07:13.160 --> 07:19.040
for leads, not sure where to go, go look at the deals you already have and look how you

07:19.040 --> 07:22.240
can turn it into two deals, three deals, four deals, those are the easiest thing to

07:22.240 --> 07:27.360
do. Go get the second money, the third money, the fourth money. I promise you that's gonna

07:27.360 --> 07:33.160
be a quick win. And nothing's better, guys, than when you finish the year on a strong

07:33.160 --> 07:38.180
note because how you finish is how you're gonna remember the year. Even if you've had

07:38.180 --> 07:44.360
a terrible year, even if you haven't hit your goals or whatever, if you go and just put

07:44.360 --> 07:49.600
your foot on the gas for the next two weeks, I guess three weeks, you're gonna look back

07:49.600 --> 07:54.360
on this year and remember it and go, man, that was a great year. I promise you because

07:54.360 --> 07:58.920
I've done this with other things too, but it's how you finish is how you remember the

07:58.920 --> 08:04.200
year or how you remember the experience. And also if you've had a phenomenal year, you

08:04.200 --> 08:09.840
go ahead and take your foot off the gas and say, I'm gonna pack it in. That's how you're

08:09.840 --> 08:13.840
gonna remember the year. It's gonna give you zero momentum going into the new year. And

08:13.840 --> 08:18.080
I think it's the worst possible way to start the new year. Now, if you are somebody that's

08:18.080 --> 08:21.400
been very intentional, you've said in your head, I'm gonna be taking off this week, these

08:21.400 --> 08:26.560
two weeks to go and travel and I've earned it, whatever, that's completely fine. But

08:26.560 --> 08:31.200
guys, go and get a deal. Even if you can get one more deal before the first year, two more

08:31.200 --> 08:39.240
deals, it's the best thing you can do to jumpstart your next year. Okay? So let's go ahead, get

08:39.240 --> 08:46.640
started real quick. And let's talk about the topic at hand. Oh, by the way, there's one

08:46.640 --> 09:00.320
more thing I wanted to share. Hold on. I think there's a new code. If you guys, let's see.

09:00.320 --> 09:04.800
By the way, guys, do you guys like in this, dude, look at this mad pic that we got going

09:04.800 --> 09:10.520
on here, dude. This is like three years ago. I'm looking sweet, dude. What's pick are you

09:10.520 --> 09:18.200
talking about? Look at look at this. The the little teaser here. Check this out. Look at

09:18.200 --> 09:23.360
Jason Jason's all fresh shaving, dude. Look at this. Yeah, that's a good Yeah, me too,

09:23.360 --> 09:27.160
dude. That's like two years ago, I think. Or maybe at least it's at least a year, dude.

09:27.160 --> 09:33.080
Freaking glow down. Just kidding. Okay, so let's get let's go ahead and get into this.

09:33.080 --> 09:37.520
We're gonna pardon Jason off of this call. I'm not sure what came up. I'm hoping he got a deal.

09:37.520 --> 09:41.520
He's very rarely not on these calls. But we're gonna go ahead and give him a little bit of an

09:41.520 --> 09:46.800
excuse. Hopefully pops in at the end. If he did sleep in, you know what, we're gonna give him a

09:46.800 --> 09:51.320
little bit of a slack because he's human. Okay. All right. Here's what I want to do, guys. Oh,

09:51.320 --> 09:55.840
what I was gonna say is if you have not signed up for Rankin and Ninja, and you wish to do so,

09:55.840 --> 10:01.160
and by the way, you don't need to use Rankin and Ninja. You can use whatever you want. Just so

10:01.160 --> 10:07.280
you know, by the way, the way that we train this up until now has been use whatever tool you want,

10:07.280 --> 10:10.800
whatever one floats your boat, whatever one frickin different strokes for different folks.

10:10.800 --> 10:15.400
But it's going to be much easier for you guys if you want to use Rankin and Ninja because our

10:15.400 --> 10:21.240
version 3.0 is going to be built entirely off of that because that's what I use exclusively now.

10:21.240 --> 10:27.840
But if you didn't want to get that or sign up for that, you guys can message me. I have a new code

10:27.880 --> 10:32.680
for those of you that haven't ever signed up for the 20% off for two months. Send me a private

10:32.680 --> 10:37.400
message. I'll give you the code. So just as a heads up, Gina Benson just got into the house.

10:37.400 --> 10:44.280
What's up, Gina Benson? Good to have you. Okay. So the reason I wanted to bring Porter on is,

10:44.280 --> 10:48.880
and we're gonna talk about the commonalities of winners, is Porter's in a unique spot because

10:48.880 --> 10:56.320
most of the people between him and Jason, most of the people that join our program, most people that

10:56.320 --> 11:03.400
join this community now are going through Porter and Jason at some point. They're talking to them

11:03.400 --> 11:09.760
on a phone call before they get on a call with Kyle. And also, for those of you that have been

11:09.760 --> 11:15.800
in this group a while, you guys remember last year Porter was doing, he was the accountability

11:15.800 --> 11:23.360
coach and he was jumping on calls with people who would, basically he was holding people accountable

11:23.360 --> 11:28.240
and he was getting to really know the group. And we actually, there's a good chance we're gonna be

11:28.240 --> 11:32.520
bringing that back because we're redoing the training and going into 3.0 and changing the way

11:32.520 --> 11:37.640
we do everything. He's not doing that this second because we don't want to start and stop. But

11:37.640 --> 11:42.040
anyway, I wanted to bring him on because he has a unique perspective. He's talked to a lot of the

11:42.040 --> 11:47.640
people in this group. And so I wanted to go ahead and talk about some of the things that he's seen

11:47.640 --> 11:55.400
that are the commonalities, and I said it in the group or as the title, the commonalities of winners.

11:55.400 --> 12:02.560
One of the things that all the people that are having great success have in common. And then we're

12:02.560 --> 12:06.600
gonna talk about the things that people that are not having success have in common and we're gonna

12:06.600 --> 12:13.040
kind of dissect that a little bit. I hate when people use a bunch of quotes and that, you know,

12:13.040 --> 12:22.760
oh and so and so Napoleon Hill said this and freaking MJ DiMarco said that and you know that

12:22.760 --> 12:29.120
bugs me. But I will say that some of these quotes, as annoying as they are, I believe that they make

12:29.120 --> 12:36.000
sense and I've lived by them. And so one of the quotes that I heard many years ago, it was really

12:36.000 --> 12:41.840
cool when I heard it because I hadn't heard it 7,000 times. But the quote is success leaves clues.

12:42.320 --> 12:49.040
So forget about it being cliche, it's true. And it's like if somebody else is winning,

12:49.040 --> 12:56.880
just freaking do what they do, right? If somebody's making a million dollars a month,

12:56.880 --> 13:01.720
then I just need to look at what they do and I need to figure out what are those clues and the

13:01.720 --> 13:06.400
things that they're doing that I'm not. And, and this is Hermosy that really taught me this,

13:06.400 --> 13:12.400
what are the things that they're not doing that I'm doing? I used to think there's things that I

13:12.400 --> 13:17.040
wasn't doing enough stuff I needed to start doing and I realized a lot of times it's the things that

13:17.040 --> 13:22.800
I am doing that I shouldn't be doing. It's the extra stuff, you know, that I just need to cut

13:22.800 --> 13:27.960
out. What do I need to cut out? So yeah, Porter, let's go through that. What's the first thing

13:27.960 --> 13:31.520
that comes to your mind when I ask you like of all the people that you know that are successful,

13:31.840 --> 13:37.600
that you've talked to on an accountability call, on a call before they sign up with Kyle,

13:38.480 --> 13:45.280
what is the one, what is one thing to start that you would say most everyone has in common

13:45.840 --> 13:53.280
out of curiosity? I would say the people that, that you're mentioning, I think they all have

13:53.280 --> 13:59.520
this, this strong desire and like this faith that they're going to be able to make a lot of

13:59.520 --> 14:06.000
money. Like they, they're pretty gung-ho about making it work and they're tired of the

14:06.000 --> 14:09.520
circumstances they're in. Everyone I talk to, they're like, you know, I have this job, it's

14:09.520 --> 14:13.120
not paying enough. I want the freedom. I'm not able to go on the trips. I'm not able to do the

14:13.120 --> 14:18.480
things that I enjoy. And so that's like the number one leading motivator. I feel like for mostly

14:18.480 --> 14:25.440
everyone is just having that, you know, that money. But I think the hardest thing from holding them

14:25.440 --> 14:31.840
back is just their own heads that they're afraid to spend the money to make money. They're so in

14:31.840 --> 14:37.360
their head that I have this money and I would rather go on a trip than, you know, invest in

14:37.360 --> 14:41.760
myself sometimes, even though it's, it sounds stupid, but it's hard to, you know, go out and

14:41.760 --> 14:49.520
start your own business. So Porter used a very strong and interesting word. He said the word

14:50.320 --> 14:56.400
Whoever's read Think and Grow Rich know that that word has got to be used. I bet there's a statistic.

14:56.400 --> 15:01.760
I bet that word's used so many hundreds of times. I'm going to ask Google how many times

15:02.480 --> 15:12.240
is the word desire used in Think and Grow Rich? Somebody out there has, has looked this up.

15:12.240 --> 15:23.520
Okay. No one has put, wow, hold on. I would, I would have thought that, oh, by the way, dude,

15:23.520 --> 15:28.080
if you guys are complaining about Think and Grow Rich, you can literally go online, type in Think

15:28.080 --> 15:34.160
and Grow Rich, and you can get the freaking PDF. So, okay, I'm not seeing any number, but I will

15:34.160 --> 15:40.720
say that there, that thing has got to be used probably in the first chapter 50 times. Just so

15:40.720 --> 15:45.600
everybody knows. The point being, though, to tap into what Porter said, guys, is that

15:47.440 --> 15:51.040
I'm not going to give away Think and Grow Rich, but that's a very important word for this book.

15:52.080 --> 15:56.080
But this is what I say, you know, I used to do all the calls when people join. I'm thinking,

15:56.080 --> 16:02.880
I'm looking to see, Luke says it's exactly 47 times. How do you know that, bro? I trust that

16:02.880 --> 16:08.240
that's the case, but how do you know that? I was pretty close. I said 50. Some of the people that

16:08.240 --> 16:13.200
are on this call right now, I was the one that brought them into this group. And I will tell you

16:13.200 --> 16:17.680
this, guys, is that you would think that the difference between the people that are crushing

16:17.680 --> 16:22.640
it and the people that aren't is like something like they have sales experience, they have,

16:24.000 --> 16:31.920
you know, I don't know, they're, they grew up a certain way, they, their parents are this,

16:31.920 --> 16:37.360
their parents are not that, you know, whatever. But the truth is, guys, and I always used to say

16:37.360 --> 16:44.480
this to people is that the people that succeed are always the ones that have the greatest reason

16:44.480 --> 16:49.520
why they should succeed. And I would also say that you could use the word desire. And I used to always

16:49.520 --> 16:54.320
say to people like, and this is the thing I would look for, I wouldn't get on these calls or look

16:54.320 --> 16:58.880
through applications. And this is the same with business owners, by the way, but I wouldn't look

16:58.880 --> 17:04.160
at it and go, Oh, have they had sales experience? Have they had technical experience? I would be

17:04.160 --> 17:08.800
looking at someone's application. And I was looking to know, I was like, what the heck is

17:08.800 --> 17:14.640
driving this person? What is their why? What is the reason why they want to do this? And the greater

17:14.640 --> 17:22.880
the why, the stronger the why, the more confident I was, and the more flexible I was willing to be

17:22.880 --> 17:27.040
to get them inside of the program, because I knew that they would have success. And on the contrary,

17:27.600 --> 17:33.920
I didn't care if they were making dog crap for money, because I knew that they would start

17:33.920 --> 17:38.320
making money if they had that strong why. And I always used to use this example. And I would say

17:38.320 --> 17:42.960
this to people, I'd say, and I used to say this to business owners, this is a little one, a good

17:42.960 --> 17:48.080
one liner or good little example you can use. When you guys are talking to your business owners,

17:48.080 --> 17:51.920
you want to position it like you're almost interviewing them. Like you have a stack of

17:51.920 --> 17:55.520
people lined up and you're trying to decide why you should work with them. This is, you got to

17:55.520 --> 17:59.360
put yourself in a position of leverage. And I would always say to people, I would say,

18:01.760 --> 18:06.000
if I asked you right now, Mr. Business Owner, or let's say I was talking to a potential student,

18:06.000 --> 18:11.440
I would say, if I asked you, let's say we're at the top of a skyscraper and there's a skyscraper

18:11.440 --> 18:17.440
across from us that's 20 yards like over into the other skyscraper. And I put a, let's imagine

18:17.440 --> 18:23.440
there was a really strong two by four that wide going across into the other building. And I said

18:23.440 --> 18:31.040
to you, I'll give you $10,000 to cross into that building and go across the wood. Important,

18:31.040 --> 18:35.520
if I asked you that question, let's say we're on the 47th floor, we're in New York, we're in Vegas,

18:35.520 --> 18:40.480
skyscraper to skyscraper, $10,000 across the two by four, two by four is going to be sturdy.

18:40.480 --> 18:44.160
You're not going to shake off the two by four, but it's this thin. Would you take the deal?

18:44.160 --> 18:48.080
Yeah. For $10,000?

18:48.080 --> 18:54.640
Yeah. Dude, I don't know if I'd do it for $10,000.

18:54.640 --> 18:57.840
I wouldn't. Heck no, dude. My life is way too valuable.

18:59.040 --> 19:04.320
The downside is too valuable, dude. The downside is way too valuable. So then I would always ask,

19:04.320 --> 19:10.240
I'd say, okay, let me change the scenario. Same exact situation, two by four, no $10,000,

19:11.120 --> 19:14.720
but your daughter or your mom is in the other building and it's on fire.

19:15.520 --> 19:19.280
And the only way that you're going to save them is if you get over there. Now, obviously that

19:19.280 --> 19:23.280
probably wouldn't make sense in a real scenario because you're not going to be able to fly off

19:23.280 --> 19:28.320
the building with them. But let's just say it solved the problem. If that was the case,

19:29.200 --> 19:33.200
every single person, I imagine, unless you just hate your mom or hate your kid, which I

19:33.200 --> 19:39.920
never really met anyone that hates their kid, but every single person, if it was $0 on the line,

19:39.920 --> 19:44.560
but it was someone's life at risk that they really loved, they would take that deal.

19:44.560 --> 19:52.080
They wouldn't even think twice about it. Right? Very true. Same situation, same risk, actually

19:55.200 --> 20:00.880
there's no money on the line, but the Y is greater. That's the only difference. And guess what? You

20:00.880 --> 20:06.880
are going to see people move mountains to get across there. So the point being, guys, is that

20:06.880 --> 20:13.520
the people that are successful in this business, they have the greatest reason to be successful.

20:14.400 --> 20:17.440
So here's a question I want to ask Porter. And by the way, if you guys have comments,

20:17.440 --> 20:21.440
you guys have input, if you have whatever, go ahead and ask in the comments. I would love to

20:21.440 --> 20:26.960
hear the feedback, but let's just say that you're somebody that's in the group or you just joined,

20:26.960 --> 20:31.840
you've been in a while and you've kind of lost the reason. You've kind of lost the reason for

20:31.840 --> 20:37.120
whatever the case, maybe it's just gone away. The desire has gone away. Maybe you've achieved

20:37.120 --> 20:42.480
a certain level and you're not as motivated like you were. Like it's really exciting to get that

20:42.480 --> 20:48.960
first deal, to get that first 10,000, for me to get that first million, for me to get, you know,

20:48.960 --> 20:52.320
there were certain benchmarks that really got me excited. But let's say you've achieved them

20:53.360 --> 20:59.200
and you don't have that strong Y anymore, or maybe your Y was something that was superficial

20:59.200 --> 21:03.440
and it was like, I want to get that car, whatever, which by the way, isn't a very strong Y because

21:03.440 --> 21:08.640
once you get it, then what, then what? How do you get, how in your opinion, do you acquire

21:09.360 --> 21:17.840
that strong Y if you don't have it? That's hard because I think everyone has their own goals,

21:17.840 --> 21:21.680
because I mean, you join this and maybe it's like, hey, if I get to 10,000, that's going to

21:21.680 --> 21:25.280
supplement me enough. And like, you know, I'm not looking to make a hundred thousand a month.

21:25.280 --> 21:32.400
It's hard to motivate that person. But what I would say is I think goals are so important,

21:32.400 --> 21:38.160
especially like monthly goals, weekly goals, daily goals. I think if you're setting yourself

21:38.160 --> 21:43.120
up for success and you're like, you're always checking things off the list. I know when you

21:43.120 --> 21:47.520
set a goal out for eight months away, it's pretty hard to measure that. You need to set your long

21:47.520 --> 21:54.160
goal and then your monthly goals and then, you know, your weekly and daily goals. But I would

21:54.160 --> 21:58.640
just say like for me in that situation, when I've gotten stagnant and I feel like I haven't been as

21:58.640 --> 22:03.680
focused, it's, I got to come back to the, I come back to the training. I start back over. I almost

22:03.680 --> 22:07.520
rewatch the whole training again so that I can like catch this new fire. Cause every time I listen

22:07.520 --> 22:12.000
to it, it's like, why am I not doing more of this? Whenever I land a deal and like, if I just do this

22:12.000 --> 22:15.920
10 more times, I'm going to be at this point, you know? So it motivates me just to get that one more

22:15.920 --> 22:21.120
deal. But I would say get one more deal. Just do, you don't need to get to 10 or like 20 more

22:21.120 --> 22:27.040
thousand dollars. Just get one more deal and then one more deal. Like just keep, keep putting that

22:27.040 --> 22:32.720
stuff in front of you. And that may work for some, but I do think goals for me is the only way that

22:32.720 --> 22:37.280
I could ever stay motivated and think about what would my life be like if I stopped doing this?

22:37.280 --> 22:40.560
And then that kind of motivates me to keep doing this, you know? Like I don't want to go back to

22:40.560 --> 22:46.320
where I was. I want to keep growing. I don't want to lose my deals that I have. And so yeah, I would

22:46.320 --> 22:51.200
say that would be like my motivating factor. I really like that a lot. I know that we're not

22:51.200 --> 22:56.320
going to talk a ton about goals, but one thing that really helps, and we talked about this many

22:56.320 --> 23:01.680
times and it's something that I did and I stopped doing and I regret that I stopped doing it, but

23:01.680 --> 23:05.520
not just writing your goals down, but actually reading them and reading them at least twice a

23:05.520 --> 23:10.080
day, one in the morning, one at night. It sounds stupid. It sounds cliche. It is, but it works.

23:10.080 --> 23:14.160
And there's a reason why people do it. Okay. Another thing I want to mention, and this is

23:14.160 --> 23:19.440
something that I think changes everything because some people are like not, let's say some people

23:19.440 --> 23:22.880
aren't motivated. They're like, I don't know. I just don't really have that fire that I used to

23:22.880 --> 23:27.760
have, or I never really had it, or I don't know how to get it. Guys, one thing that I know is that

23:29.040 --> 23:36.160
if you get around people that are playing at a much higher level, you are by force going to

23:36.800 --> 23:41.200
either be inspired or discouraged. And depending on the type of person that you are, some people

23:41.200 --> 23:45.440
get discouraged. Some people get inspired. If you're a discouraged person by other people's success,

23:45.440 --> 23:51.680
then that's probably indicative of your entire life. For me, when I get around people that are

23:51.680 --> 24:01.840
freaking crushing it and just bawling out, it shows me how small I am, how insignificant my

24:02.560 --> 24:07.680
quote unquote success has been. And I'm like, dude, I got to freaking pick this up.

24:07.680 --> 24:14.560
You know what I mean? When I'm thinking I'm big shot because I make a couple hundred thousand

24:14.560 --> 24:20.400
dollars a month, and then I'm around people that are making a million dollars a month,

24:20.400 --> 24:27.680
and I realize that, dude, I'm just to pee on, dude. These people are dropping millions of

24:27.680 --> 24:34.320
dollars into projects and into companies and starting new companies, sometimes quarterly

24:34.560 --> 24:39.280
with multi-million. Dude, that gets me freaking fired up and shows me how small I'm playing.

24:39.280 --> 24:42.640
And then when I sit there and I'm with my same group of friends or I'm with a group of friends

24:42.640 --> 24:48.240
that make me comfortable, that are a bunch of freaking screw-offs that I've known forever that

24:48.240 --> 24:51.520
aren't going anywhere, or maybe they are, but they're just not going anywhere right now,

24:52.240 --> 24:57.840
it's really easy to get complacent thinking you're the big hog on the saddle. You know what I mean?

24:58.240 --> 25:05.280
For you, Porter, you live in Parowan, which is a great spot, it's nice, whatever, but you got to

25:05.280 --> 25:11.360
be careful for those of you that are in towns you grew up in or around. Parowan, the downside

25:11.360 --> 25:17.680
with somewhere like that is there's just not a lot of people doing anything. You get married to

25:17.680 --> 25:23.440
somebody from the hometown, no beef there, as long as they're not your cousin, which happens a lot as

25:23.440 --> 25:28.480
well. Which could happen. That's a win, but that's the biggest win of their life. I married

25:28.480 --> 25:35.840
someone not my cousin. It's like, no, dude, no. But it's this complacency of like, dude, you got

25:35.840 --> 25:41.680
a little house and whatever. And so you've got to force yourself to get around people

25:42.640 --> 25:47.600
who are playing at a bigger level. Some of you guys are in situations and in cities and in

25:47.600 --> 25:53.840
environments where it's much easier. I know when I go to Dubai, I see five Lamborghinis a day.

25:54.560 --> 25:58.880
I realize like, dude, I'm nothing. And by the way, I'm not sure if any of that money's real.

25:58.880 --> 26:03.600
I think it's a lot of drug money. I'm not really sure how people make money in Dubai. But nonetheless,

26:03.600 --> 26:08.080
I'm seeing Lamborghinis. They're coming from somewhere. And that inspires me. I'm seeing

26:08.080 --> 26:14.080
the price of a villa being $6 million. Like these things, I see that going out for dinner,

26:14.080 --> 26:20.240
you're spending $300 every single time. And these things inspire me. And some of you guys that live

26:20.240 --> 26:24.320
in cities like that, it's easier to get inspired. Some of you guys that don't, like for example,

26:24.320 --> 26:29.520
when I'm in Freetown, it's like, you don't have to have a ton of money to be the biggest dog in town.

26:30.560 --> 26:34.160
So you have to be careful. And it's one of the things I think can really, really help you. So

26:34.160 --> 26:38.480
as you guys are setting your goals, you're thinking about next year, you know, one of the goals that

26:38.480 --> 26:48.240
I have so far is I want to network with, I think I put 10 people that are making a certain amount

26:48.240 --> 26:55.520
of million dollars per year. Like their net worth is $10 million plus. And that's one of my goals.

26:56.800 --> 27:01.040
And there's different ways that you can do that. And there's different things that you can do.

27:01.040 --> 27:05.920
There's different strategies that you can have. And by all means, please, for the love,

27:05.920 --> 27:08.640
do not start messaging people and asking to pick their brain.

27:09.920 --> 27:15.520
Please lunch. Hey, you want to go to lunch? You want to grab lunch and I can pick your brain

27:15.520 --> 27:21.760
like you're doing me a favor to buy me a $7 meal. Come on. You know what I mean? You got it. You

27:21.760 --> 27:27.920
got to think about what can you do? This is the this isn't a by the way, this isn't a live on

27:27.920 --> 27:31.600
networking, but you got to think about what what do the people that I want to connect with,

27:31.600 --> 27:37.760
what do they all need? And what's something that I can add value to them by doing? What is something

27:37.760 --> 27:41.680
that they all would need? Because there's some people, you guys know this, have really,

27:41.680 --> 27:44.560
really strong networks with high network individuals. And there's certain people

27:44.560 --> 27:50.240
that are in certain businesses that by nature they are in, they have just amazing networks.

27:50.240 --> 27:57.200
There's actually a student in here that just joined. And he does, he goes and he buys

27:57.200 --> 28:03.440
exotic cars. And he has a dealer license and all this stuff. And he has he's super young,

28:03.440 --> 28:08.400
I'm going to try and get him on. He's stud, super young kid. I think he's 21 years old.

28:08.400 --> 28:13.280
This dude has one of the strongest frickin networks that I know he knows that all the

28:13.280 --> 28:18.720
big players in town. He knows he is like, I bet you his Rolodex is frickin ridiculous.

28:18.720 --> 28:24.640
But it's because he's in a business that is attractive. And again, this is there's a reason

28:24.640 --> 28:29.200
why he's in this business because that business is not recurring. But that's something that he

28:29.200 --> 28:34.400
does. That's like his job, right? That's his business before he got into this, where he's

28:35.200 --> 28:41.120
something that is attractive to people with money, right? There's people that do jet charters.

28:41.120 --> 28:46.160
There's people that are in the luxury watch business. These are all things that a lot of

28:46.160 --> 28:51.360
wealthy people are interested in. And I'm not saying by all means, don't do not go and

28:51.360 --> 28:54.880
shiny object, I'm going to start flipping watches and this and that's not what I'm saying.

28:54.880 --> 28:58.320
What I'm saying is think about how you can add value to these people, start building a strong

28:58.320 --> 29:05.200
network and start frickin getting outside of your little teeny life. One of the reasons I like to

29:05.200 --> 29:12.320
travel is when I do my mind is blown. My mind is expanded. I look at all its levels, man,

29:12.320 --> 29:15.760
and you meet some most interesting people. Like I think I told you guys this story. I met

29:16.640 --> 29:22.560
somebody from the royal family or whatever, the oil family in Saudi Arabia,

29:24.000 --> 29:28.240
looking at their car collection, looking at frickin kids 18 years old driving a yellow

29:28.240 --> 29:35.440
Canary yellow Lambo just for fun. He didn't buy, of course. That gets me pumped and I'm like,

29:35.440 --> 29:41.360
okay, his parents are frickin ballin out. You know what I mean? So anyway, that's a really

29:41.360 --> 29:46.960
important point, guys. What I would do this year as you guys are thinking about your goals

29:46.960 --> 29:54.000
is revisit your why. Revisit your why. Sit down with yourself, turn off the distractions, sit down

29:54.000 --> 30:00.400
with a pen and paper, maybe put on some light concentration music from Spotify and ask yourself

30:01.040 --> 30:06.880
why, why, why? What do you want is the most important and hardest question to answer in

30:06.880 --> 30:12.320
this life? Ask yourself, what do you want? For me in 2019, I said I want $100,000 per month

30:12.320 --> 30:18.640
and I said, why? And then I answered it. And then I said, well, why do I want, why, why to that

30:18.640 --> 30:23.920
answer? And why did that answer? And I just tried to dig like really far down. And by doing this,

30:23.920 --> 30:29.680
I discovered some things about myself that like how I tick, what drives me, all these different

30:29.680 --> 30:36.000
things. And it allowed me to just like, for every time things got tough, I could just remember,

30:36.000 --> 30:40.720
okay, that's exactly why I'm doing it. So anyway, this isn't about a why. So that's really,

30:40.720 --> 30:45.840
really interesting. So basically everyone that you've seen accountability, like in these

30:45.840 --> 30:50.720
accountability calls, on these calls before they joined, they are, they have a strong desire,

30:50.720 --> 30:56.720
but I would guarantee it's linked to a strong why. Is that fair to say? Yeah. Okay. What do

30:56.720 --> 31:03.920
you think on the flip side is the commonality of losers, the commonality of the people that

31:03.920 --> 31:09.600
get in the program and, you know, within a month, they stop doing it. Within a month,

31:09.600 --> 31:13.600
they're distracted. Within a month, they're messaging me. Oh, I can't find the answer to

31:13.600 --> 31:19.760
this. Or I can't, my ads, they're just not cranking. It's like, dude, what'd you expect

31:19.760 --> 31:24.320
it just to work perfect the first time? It's like, bro, I'm sitting over at 1.5 million,

31:24.320 --> 31:29.600
like just relax, it's going to come through. And they want to blame everything else, every other

31:29.600 --> 31:35.200
situation under the freaking stars, except for themselves. What is that the commonality of the

31:35.200 --> 31:42.240
losers, bro? I would say they, I don't know what the right word for that is, but they don't,

31:42.240 --> 31:47.040
they definitely don't take enough, they definitely don't take enough risks. They definitely don't

31:47.040 --> 31:51.040
work as hard because I think a lot of people get in this group and they don't find the city within

31:51.040 --> 31:54.960
the first couple of days. And they kind of are like, dude, there's just no cities. Like it's too

31:54.960 --> 32:00.320
saturated. And they've tried, they've tried one niche, they haven't think outside the box. Like

32:00.320 --> 32:04.160
everyone's thinking the exact same thing. And if you can't find a city, you guys start thinking a

32:04.160 --> 32:11.520
little differently to find a city. And so I would say a lot of it's in your own head and it's like

32:11.520 --> 32:17.600
a dumb answer, but it's so true. It's like, you guys are just so afraid to work hard almost. Like

32:17.600 --> 32:22.560
you're afraid to give this everything you have and make this the only thing that's going to make

32:22.560 --> 32:26.480
you money. Like you can do have part-time jobs, but you got to treat it as if this is your only

32:26.480 --> 32:31.120
thing. And when you do that, you really start taking more seriously. Like when I was like,

32:31.120 --> 32:35.040
okay, I'm going to make this work no matter what. And I don't care how long it takes me. I got to

32:35.040 --> 32:39.440
deal with in the first month, you know, but it was just my mindset of like being fearless enough to

32:39.440 --> 32:42.240
be like, Hey, I'm just going to spend the money. Like, I know I don't have an excess amount of

32:42.240 --> 32:46.320
money. Like I'm not just going to throw it against the wall, but like, it's okay. Like if I lose a

32:46.320 --> 32:50.560
little bit of money, it's fine. And when I had that mindset, I, you start to just piggyback off

32:50.560 --> 32:57.920
these deals that you get. Yeah, I agree. I think another thing I want to mention really, really

32:57.920 --> 33:04.560
quick is the people that struggle the most, they have, they have this mindset. I'm going to call

33:04.560 --> 33:13.840
it the, if it works mindset. Okay. That's a, if this works or if this thing happens, then blah,

33:13.840 --> 33:22.880
blah, blah. So, you know, if I'm at a thousand, if I'm at my first deal within 30 days, then I'm

33:22.880 --> 33:28.480
going to keep doing this. You know, if this thing happens by the end, it's like this, if it's like,

33:28.480 --> 33:34.080
no, no, no, no, no, no. If you would just change that guys, the moment that I change this, and I,

33:34.080 --> 33:39.840
I'm trying to not sound like Mr. Frickin rah rah, because I promise you, when I get on Instagram,

33:40.560 --> 33:49.280
when I see fricking YouTube videos and every person is now somehow a guru motivational speaker.

33:49.280 --> 33:53.120
Have you noticed that by the way, just as a side brand real quick? Definitely feel like there's a

33:53.120 --> 33:58.640
lot more in the last couple of years. And I want to just publicly apologize if I ever came across

33:58.640 --> 34:03.600
like that, which I know I did. I really hope at the time I wasn't trying to be that person. I was

34:03.600 --> 34:09.760
just passionate because I literally, last night, even some of these people that have a lot of

34:09.760 --> 34:18.400
followers, like I was listening to, oh, what's his name, dude? Okay. It was, I found this,

34:18.960 --> 34:24.800
I found this podcast. I was looking at my area, St. George, Utah, and there's this podcast

34:24.800 --> 34:31.280
interviewing like, basically it's a hyper-focused podcast on St. George, Utah. And it's like,

34:32.000 --> 34:37.440
because it's only focusing on St. George, Utah, their pool to pull from of interviewing of guests

34:37.440 --> 34:43.440
is very small. And I'm looking and I know, I recognize some of the people and I'm like,

34:43.440 --> 34:49.520
why the hell are we interviewing the fricking secretary of the local real estate office?

34:50.640 --> 34:54.320
Like, let's have some standards. And I don't know who, I think it was this guy,

34:54.320 --> 34:58.080
this other guy, I have the best account for you guys to follow. He just makes fun of influencers.

34:58.080 --> 35:02.240
And I promise you, if he made fun of me, I would probably just share it because there's

35:02.240 --> 35:08.320
videos he could make fun of me. But he's like, dude, you don't need a podcast, spoiler alert,

35:08.320 --> 35:12.320
you don't need a podcast, you don't need a podcast. It's just annoying at this point. Okay.

35:14.480 --> 35:19.040
It's very annoying. So I just wanted to throw that in there. Guys, we're not trying to be on

35:19.040 --> 35:24.480
here thinking that we're fricking bee's knees, hot crap. We know everything. Dude, we're just

35:24.480 --> 35:28.160
trying to figure this out like you guys are, but we have learned a few things. We've observed a

35:28.160 --> 35:33.680
couple things. So I just, I'm trying to just let you know that I know how cringe some of the stuff

35:33.680 --> 35:38.800
I probably have said. I'm just trying to be the fricking messenger. Shout out to Kanye, right?

35:38.800 --> 35:47.920
He's the messenger. He's the espresso, as he says. But dude, in 2019, this is from experience,

35:47.920 --> 35:54.560
not from me reading a book. 2019, I had my back up against the wall, $60,000 in debt,

35:54.560 --> 35:58.480
thinking about quitting, thinking about going to be a salesperson, which by the way, no shame on

35:58.480 --> 36:04.960
being a salesperson. But the reason why I had shame around it is because I was thinking about

36:04.960 --> 36:11.840
quitting. That's really what it was. I was thinking about quitting. And I sat down with myself,

36:11.840 --> 36:18.080
yellow notepad. You guys know the story. What do you want? Just shared it. And I changed my

36:18.080 --> 36:24.160
mentality because I realized at that moment, this was the model. I had the right model.

36:24.800 --> 36:32.400
I just needed to figure a few things out. And up until then, although I was doing it,

36:32.400 --> 36:38.720
I still had one foot out, one eye kind of on the streets. And I was never all in. I was never

36:38.720 --> 36:43.520
faithful. Let's just use an analogy of being faithful in a relationship. I was cheating on

36:43.520 --> 36:47.520
my main thing. I had my eye in the streets, and I was always looking for that better thing.

36:48.400 --> 36:53.840
And it made it so I could never succeed. I could never go all in. And the only thing that had to

36:53.840 --> 36:59.280
happen is I had to just look at it and go, this is the right model. I just got to figure this out.

36:59.280 --> 37:05.600
And I changed from, I remember, I got this new energy. I got this new excitement. I had this new

37:05.600 --> 37:12.960
energy to like, this is it. I just have to do it long enough. And I have to be willing for this to

37:12.960 --> 37:19.360
take forever. I have to be willing for me to just realize I'm going to be doing this forever,

37:19.360 --> 37:24.320
period. And as soon as I did that, guys, everything changed. The way that I approached

37:24.320 --> 37:29.200
my day changed. The way that I approached doing due diligence. I no longer felt like it was this

37:29.200 --> 37:32.240
thing I was trying to check out the box. I was like, no, I got to master due diligence.

37:32.880 --> 37:37.760
I started looking at my ads, and instead of being annoyed, I was like, I want to master. I want to

37:37.760 --> 37:40.960
become so good at ads. I want to get a little bit better, a little bit better. I want to be able to

37:40.960 --> 37:45.840
do them in five minutes and 31 seconds, which I used to be able to do when we were doing the

37:45.840 --> 37:51.280
smart campaigns. And every fast of the business, I became obsessed with. And you guys know when

37:51.280 --> 37:55.200
you've met someone or see somebody that's obsessed with whatever they do, and it's just contagious.

37:55.760 --> 38:00.400
I just changed the mentality to instead of, I'm going to do it for a year. I'm going to do it for

38:00.400 --> 38:04.960
three months. I'm going to do it whatever, until I'm good. I'm doing this until it works.

38:06.160 --> 38:10.480
I just knew deep down this is the right model. And here's the advantage you guys have that I didn't.

38:11.120 --> 38:16.560
I didn't know anyone that was doing $100,000 a month. I didn't know anyone that was doing

38:16.560 --> 38:22.080
$30,000 a month. I saw people posting checks, but I promise you that they were lying. You know when

38:22.080 --> 38:26.080
you can tell someone's lying when they say it and it's like, bro, how much you really making, right?

38:26.080 --> 38:31.680
People in here making freaking $70 million a second these days, according to Instagram,

38:32.320 --> 38:39.040
right? They're full of crap. I didn't have anyone. I didn't have Ryan Dalton making $87,000. It started

38:39.040 --> 38:45.040
two years ago to be like, yo, if Ryan did it with a full-time job, kids and dog and jujitsu and all

38:45.040 --> 38:50.320
this stuff, I can do it. I didn't have that, but I just knew deep down I could do it. But as soon as

38:50.320 --> 38:56.160
I changed that, dude, everything freaking changed. I started just approaching the day different. I

38:56.160 --> 38:59.680
started attacking the day different. I started getting up with a new zeal. I started staying up

38:59.680 --> 39:07.520
late. I cut the Netflix during the week. Dude, everything changed, dude. All the other stuff

39:07.520 --> 39:12.000
fell out, dude. I didn't care. I wasn't looking at other businesses. I wasn't ready to start other

39:12.000 --> 39:17.360
businesses. That was all I had to change. That mindset shift was huge for me, okay?

39:20.480 --> 39:28.000
Real quick, I want to talk about this as well. What do you think? This could be from people you've

39:28.000 --> 39:33.520
talked to, people you've interacted with, but I think that one of the issues nowadays is that we

39:33.520 --> 39:39.280
try to add all these extra things. We try to add... I got to do... And this is an extreme example. I'm

39:39.280 --> 39:44.240
not trying to steal from Formosy or any of these guys, but they do a really good job making fun of

39:44.240 --> 39:53.040
it. The cold plunge and this freaking one-hour routine and the meditation and the affirmations

39:53.040 --> 39:58.480
and all this different stuff. I think it was a really fresh idea when Formosy was like,

39:58.480 --> 40:06.720
you could also just wake up and walk into your office and work. That also works. Anyway, by the

40:06.720 --> 40:09.520
way, I got nothing against cold plunge. I actually think it's rad. I just don't think you need to

40:09.520 --> 40:14.800
post about it. That's it, okay? For the record, Ford, I know you got a cold plunger, but don't

40:14.800 --> 40:20.720
be hiding that from anybody. Dude, consistently, dude. It's good for the joints. Dude, I would do

40:20.720 --> 40:26.400
that. I'm all for the cold plunge. The point is, don't think that you need to do cold plungers to

40:26.400 --> 40:32.560
make $10,000 a month, $50,000 a month. What I want to talk about really quick are what are some of

40:32.560 --> 40:39.440
the things that you see people, they have a misconception about, what are some of the things

40:39.440 --> 40:45.680
that people think they need to be doing that are just distractions, right? That's another thing

40:45.680 --> 40:53.120
that I went... The years that I've really grown, dude, are the years where I sit there and I think,

40:53.120 --> 40:58.400
what can I eliminate? That was another huge thing for me. I know we're talking about the

40:58.400 --> 41:02.560
commonalities of winners, but I'm going to put myself in that. I've got to observe myself,

41:02.560 --> 41:08.080
retrospectively, looking at that. One of the things that I did, and I've shared this before,

41:08.080 --> 41:14.160
is I cut all the BS. I eliminated, I simplified, I simplified, I simplified.

41:15.280 --> 41:18.480
I'm going to share some of the things that I simplified, but what do you think, Porter,

41:18.480 --> 41:24.880
are some of the things that people, from what you've seen, need to simplify in their life,

41:24.880 --> 41:33.520
need to get rid of to have the success to become a winner? Guys, it's ridiculous to know. If you're

41:33.520 --> 41:40.720
watching this call right now, and you know that Porter's at $9,400 a month, and he's also farming

41:40.720 --> 41:44.960
full-time, and you're not at five, you're not at one, you don't have a deal, and you've been

41:44.960 --> 41:50.800
doing this for anywhere close to the same amount of time, that should really piss you off. It should

41:50.800 --> 41:56.080
inspire you, and it should piss you off. No way, dude. No way I'm letting Porter do this, and I'm

41:56.080 --> 42:00.160
not. You know what I mean? I used to do this about people as well, dude. It's good to have people on

42:00.160 --> 42:04.880
your radar. Anyway, Porter, what do you think are some of the things that people need to cut out

42:04.880 --> 42:08.240
that they're doing that they shouldn't be doing? Because we always talk about what you should add,

42:08.240 --> 42:13.920
routine, 10 pages of a book, gallon of water, cold plunge, this pill, that pill, freaking

42:14.720 --> 42:20.160
grounding, sun on the face, dude, watching Liver King, listening to Joe Rogan, like all the freaking

42:20.160 --> 42:25.840
cliche stuff that all of us do, but some of us think that it's necessary to have success.

42:25.840 --> 42:30.000
What are some of the things we need to cut? Again, observing other people. We're not being

42:30.880 --> 42:36.640
influencers here. We're not being Tony Robbins here. We're just observing. We're just country

42:36.640 --> 42:42.880
folk that are observing. Dude, I don't know if it was just me, and I guarantee if I say this,

42:44.400 --> 42:50.320
if this is you, comment below, but how many times do you think you have to have this mile-long list

42:50.880 --> 42:56.000
the next day? I would sit down and I would write and I would write down the most small things that

42:56.000 --> 43:02.800
would not do anything to get me closer to moving the needle. It would be like doing due diligence

43:02.800 --> 43:07.200
or like, I mean, that was, but like at the time I was doing so much due diligence that I wasn't

43:07.200 --> 43:13.680
acting. I wasn't actually taking initiative. So I think simplify your list. And if you do a list,

43:13.680 --> 43:18.240
if you do it to do list, pick three things or pick big things that you're going to be able to

43:18.240 --> 43:21.840
do and just do them because you're going to get them done a lot faster. I would say,

43:21.840 --> 43:26.800
eliminate social media. Like during your work, when you're working, I found that I look at my

43:26.800 --> 43:32.160
phone a lot when I'm on my computer, I'll have my phone sitting and I'll be on computer. And if I

43:32.160 --> 43:36.480
don't like set a timer or something to try to work for a certain amount of time. And I know

43:36.480 --> 43:40.640
Hermosa does that. And he says, every time you get distracted, if you pause your timer,

43:40.640 --> 43:45.520
you'll actually realize that you can do the same task in half as much time. And I'm like,

43:46.080 --> 43:49.600
so the other day I was doing, I was setting up a campaign and I was kind of dreading it because I,

43:50.240 --> 43:53.920
sometimes I have to go through, look at the training, you know, go back and forth.

43:53.920 --> 43:58.720
And I really sat down and just did it. And it literally took me 15 minutes. And for whatever

43:58.720 --> 44:02.960
reason, I thought it was going to take me an hour or whatever. It was 15 minutes and I got so much

44:02.960 --> 44:07.920
done. And it just took getting started for me to realize like, what am I doing? Like this is,

44:07.920 --> 44:13.520
this is so simple, but I had to create, I create these long lists. So I think that I need to start

44:13.520 --> 44:17.680
checking things off. And naturally you want to go after the smallest things possible because it

44:17.680 --> 44:21.600
makes you feel good. It's like, make your bed. It's like, go to the gym. It's like, read, read

44:21.600 --> 44:25.280
a book. And those are things that are pretty easy to do and you can check it off, but they're not

44:25.280 --> 44:30.960
really getting you closer to your goals. So I would say for me, and I don't know most of you,

44:30.960 --> 44:37.440
probably simplify your list, get rid of social media and just realize that it doesn't take you

44:37.440 --> 44:42.000
as long as you think to get stuff done. That's a really, that's a really strong point.

44:42.960 --> 44:47.600
And by the way, as you said that, Sean said, my biggest waste of time was doom scrolling. I deleted

44:47.600 --> 44:52.720
TikTok and Instagram at seven AM this morning. Yes, yes, yes. And yes, guys, one of the things

44:53.680 --> 44:59.280
that I do and I, I, I'm not perfect at this. And sometimes I catch myself like going a few days

44:59.280 --> 45:03.120
and realizing, oh my gosh, I wasted a bunch of time. Even at, even where I'm at, I still catch

45:03.120 --> 45:08.320
myself doing this. But one thing that I think is very important is to get, just get social media

45:08.560 --> 45:15.040
off your phone, get it off your phone, turn it on to post, delete it, and then give yourself a

45:15.040 --> 45:20.160
certain time every day where you can go and you can feel, you can not feel guilty by just scrolling

45:20.160 --> 45:24.720
and just kind of unwinding if you want. Okay. But literally you got to set a 15 minute timer.

45:24.720 --> 45:31.040
So what I try to do again, try, because I didn't even do this yesterday admittedly, but I did a

45:31.040 --> 45:37.440
pretty good job last week is I delete it. It's deleted all day. And then I have this little time

45:37.920 --> 45:42.080
timeline where I want to get on and post. I don't even write my post on Instagram.

45:42.080 --> 45:48.640
I write my post in the notes app. And I also think of which stories I want to share

45:49.440 --> 45:54.320
on my thing. So then what I do is I download Instagram, I copy and paste, I put the picture

45:54.320 --> 45:59.600
in, I paste the, the, the, whatever the body of the text. And then I put the location, boom,

45:59.600 --> 46:06.000
I post it. I go share a few stories. And within 20 minutes, I can have a nice post, all my stories.

46:06.000 --> 46:10.960
And then guys, if I just delete it right after, cause I know some of you guys, it's so tempting

46:10.960 --> 46:16.960
to sit there and go, who liked it? I wonder how cool they think I am. Like, let's be honest,

46:16.960 --> 46:21.920
we've all done it, dude. Who's looking at my story? You don't pour it on admit you haven't done that

46:21.920 --> 46:28.640
last week, dude. We all, we all, we're all guilty of it. Stupid dude. Like that gets us anywhere in

46:28.640 --> 46:32.400
life, but we all do it. Right. And you're just sitting there and you're waiting for a little

46:32.400 --> 46:38.880
freaking comment. And it's like, dude, you know, it's interesting. Just delete it. And then you go

46:38.880 --> 46:43.440
in to make your post the next day, make your post, and then give yourself an extra five minutes to

46:43.440 --> 46:50.320
read the comments and be like, Oh, I looked at who liked it in 15 seconds. I replied to the one

46:50.320 --> 46:56.320
comment I got. Thanks mom. And that's it. And I just saved myself, not only the time of scrolling,

46:56.320 --> 47:00.160
but the distraction of every single time. Oh, wonder who texts me. I wonder if they're following

47:00.160 --> 47:06.240
me back. It's like, dude, freaking come on guys. Okay. I'm speaking to myself. So true.

47:06.240 --> 47:09.760
It's freaking happened. By the way, Sean said I give props to TikTok because it's how I found

47:09.760 --> 47:14.480
the program. I just don't need it now. Yeah. A hundred percent. But by the way, when you do your

47:14.480 --> 47:19.840
15 minutes, if you guys assume to do 15 minutes a day as of consuming, there's different levels of

47:19.840 --> 47:23.920
it. Like there's stuff you can add value. I like to go and like listen to Theo Vaughn cause he's

47:23.920 --> 47:28.960
freaking hilarious. Um, that's to me, that's value. That's entertainment. I'll take that over

47:28.960 --> 47:33.520
Netflix. But also I think there's some interesting stuff like you can find on some of these

47:33.520 --> 47:37.760
platforms and you don't just sit there and like consume or, you know, inspiring, interesting

47:37.760 --> 47:43.360
educational. So there's different levels, but guys, let me just share this. Um, in 2020,

47:43.360 --> 47:46.320
when I scaled up to a hundred thousand dollars a month, let me share some of the things I did.

47:46.320 --> 47:52.560
Okay. Is social media. I basically just got rid of it. Okay. Like I don't even, I don't even know

47:52.560 --> 47:56.720
if I posted. I'm sure I did, but I don't think I posted much. I don't think I consume much. I was

47:56.720 --> 48:02.000
just tired of being broke. I got rid of that for the most part. Um, but more than that guys,

48:02.000 --> 48:07.680
I got rid of a bunch of the things that you, they're, they're the silent killers.

48:07.680 --> 48:14.400
Let me give you an example. Lunches with your, but with your business buds. Okay. I was because if

48:14.400 --> 48:19.200
you guys work in an office, it's really easy to be like, dude, let's go meet for lunch, blah, blah,

48:19.200 --> 48:24.080
blah. And guys, you, it takes two hours to meet for lunch. Like it just does. You got to drive

48:24.080 --> 48:28.080
there. That's 10 minutes, 15 minutes, depending on where you live. You're going to order your food.

48:28.080 --> 48:32.000
You're going to want to talk. It's going to be about an hour. Then you're going to do another

48:32.000 --> 48:36.240
15, 20 minutes, get back to the office. And of course you got to grab you a soda, right? Pour

48:36.240 --> 48:40.720
a little swig ski on the way back. There's another 10, 15 minutes. Then when you get in the office,

48:40.720 --> 48:44.800
you got to chat, right? Jessica's at the front. She's got to ask me a question where I'm asking

48:44.800 --> 48:50.400
her when she's going to Italy, dude, I'm two hours of my day to go and get lunch with somebody.

48:50.400 --> 48:55.760
So in 2020, it helped that there was nowhere open, of course, at the beginning of the year,

48:55.760 --> 49:01.040
because, you know, what restaurants were closed, there's only takeout. But even after things

49:01.040 --> 49:08.320
started opening up, I just didn't do it. Okay. So I got rid of the BS lunches. Number two is I got

49:08.320 --> 49:13.440
rid of all the hobbies. And I'm not saying that you need to do this and be fanatical forever,

49:13.440 --> 49:18.720
but if you guys are not where you want to be, if you guys are not free or, and especially if you

49:18.720 --> 49:24.240
haven't gotten your first deal, guys there that you can have a season of your life where you just

49:24.240 --> 49:29.840
go locked in. You kind of do that. Like people call it monk mode or they go away in the wilderness

49:29.840 --> 49:34.320
for a while. But if you just got into this program, you don't have a deal. I highly,

49:34.320 --> 49:39.760
highly, highly recommend that you guys eliminate as much as possible. Not that it needs to be

49:39.760 --> 49:46.800
forever, but for a season of my life, I did not do golf. I did not do pickleball. I did not do

49:46.880 --> 49:52.800
fricking basketball. Only thing I did is I went to the gym because that helped me with my business.

49:53.600 --> 49:58.640
But I got rid of everything else. Okay. Another thing I got rid of is I got rid of watching

49:58.640 --> 50:04.800
Netflix. Okay. I, by the way, I got rid of watching Netflix during the week, Monday,

50:04.800 --> 50:09.840
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday night, Saturday night, I can watch it. And boy,

50:09.840 --> 50:15.760
did I watch, I blew through seasons, dude. I was times I woke up, I was like, dude, it's 4 30 AM,

50:15.760 --> 50:22.560
dude. Eyes wired like I had taken, you know, five packs of Marl bros. I had a Zen in each

50:22.560 --> 50:28.800
little pouch, dude, watch it. Just, I would hit seasons, bro. But at least it was,

50:28.800 --> 50:33.840
it was very channel. Okay. Nothing during the week. Nothing's messing with my week. Okay.

50:33.840 --> 50:39.200
Further than that, I kept eliminating. I got rid of all the extra services. I was done with SEO.

50:39.200 --> 50:43.360
I was done with fricking social media management. I got rid of all of that.

50:43.360 --> 50:48.640
Then I got rid of all my extra niches and I dialed in on one niche and I'm like,

50:48.640 --> 50:52.080
I'm going to go one niche and then I'm going to sell these other websites that I,

50:52.080 --> 50:59.040
that are generating leads. I got rid of all of my deal structures, paper lead gone, commission

50:59.040 --> 51:04.160
gone. It was never really there anyway. Only flat fee. I got rid of all my pricing options,

51:04.160 --> 51:08.880
a thousand dollars plus. I got rid of all my contract options. It's one six months at the

51:08.880 --> 51:14.240
minimum. That's it. Boom. And guys, I had such a simple life. I would wake up,

51:15.280 --> 51:21.200
gym was closed. Luckily my buddy, about a block away invited me. 7 a.m. I'd be at his gym.

51:22.080 --> 51:29.280
We would work out for one hour. I would come back and get to work. I would work. I'd have

51:29.280 --> 51:35.040
some lunch midday. I'd work some more. I'd be at the kids two, three hours. They'd go to bed.

51:35.840 --> 51:41.440
I'd come back up to the office and that's it. And guys, in my work, like Porter said,

51:41.440 --> 51:48.800
it wasn't fricking stupid stuff. Checking boxes. It was literally make calls, find new areas,

51:50.080 --> 51:53.760
hook new business owners, close deals. Like that's what I focused on and everything else,

51:53.760 --> 52:00.080
find someone to do it. And what do you know from 2019 December, eight to 10,000 bucks a month,

52:00.080 --> 52:03.520
July, 2020, a hundred thousand dollars a month. No coincidence.

52:05.200 --> 52:09.680
Simplicity is more simple and more. Yeah. Less is more. More is less. 100%

52:10.640 --> 52:14.000
Gina says, I'm totally guilty of using Instagram, especially as a distraction,

52:14.000 --> 52:17.120
beating myself up right now, along with you right now. It's such a waste of time. I get so much done

52:17.120 --> 52:21.680
when I had my phone. Yeah. And guys, I think if you're intentional about it, like give yourself

52:21.680 --> 52:25.840
some time, maybe if it's 30 minutes at night, say, Hey, every night when everything's done,

52:25.840 --> 52:30.720
I plan my day. I would recommend not doing it in bed, but like, I'm going to give myself 30

52:30.720 --> 52:35.200
minutes. Maybe sip on your fricking nightly lemon and ginger tea with a little drop of Manuka honey.

52:36.640 --> 52:41.600
That'll put you to sleep. That'll put you on your behind. While you're doing that,

52:41.600 --> 52:46.880
you give yourself 30 minutes, 15 Instagram, 15 TikTok, and then delete the apps. Okay.

52:46.880 --> 52:51.680
And I promise you when you wake up and you don't do fricking check your phone on who liked my post,

52:51.680 --> 52:54.560
you're going to get a lot more done, but Gina, don't beat yourself up. We all do it. I fricking

52:54.560 --> 52:58.880
did it yesterday. It's just one of those things we've got to remind ourselves. Jason says,

52:58.880 --> 53:01.920
setting up a separate device for social media and removing them entirely from the device I

53:01.920 --> 53:06.240
carry all day and the process that I speak. I love that. You know, when I shared this last thing

53:07.120 --> 53:13.600
in 2022, I did this, this worked for a period of time. I don't know why I stopped doing it.

53:13.600 --> 53:17.520
Maybe I should do it. And this isn't something that's necessary, but I actually went and got

53:17.520 --> 53:23.520
a completely separate phone, separate number, everything. I actually got this from dad because

53:23.520 --> 53:27.920
he does it too, or he was getting a bunch of calls from his church stuff. But I had this little

53:27.920 --> 53:33.040
fricking tiny, I had another, it was a smartphone, but it was the little tiny one and it was a

53:33.040 --> 53:39.040
different number and it had nothing on it and no one had my number. That's it. The only one that

53:39.040 --> 53:42.720
had my number. I didn't even have it. You didn't have my number. My wife had my number in case

53:42.720 --> 53:46.880
there was emergency. I think, I think, I think my dad and mom had my number. I think there was like

53:46.880 --> 53:51.440
three people that had my number and guess what? That was the phone I used during the day. So I

53:51.440 --> 53:58.160
knew that there was no emergencies happening, but I was, I was locked in, baby. I was locked in.

53:58.160 --> 54:02.480
So again, that's an extreme example. If you, you can do that, but you don't need to do that. You

54:02.480 --> 54:09.040
can also just not look at your phone. You can also just fricking turn it off. And that's it. And if

54:09.040 --> 54:12.160
you have a spouse or a significant other that doesn't understand that you need to have a serious

54:12.160 --> 54:15.680
talk, cause it's like, dude, we're making money during the day and then I'm going to be with you

54:15.680 --> 54:23.360
at night. Okay. That's it. So guys, I hope you guys are excited as I am about 20 fricking 25.

54:23.920 --> 54:28.800
We have another year ahead of us. We have, we have, we can, we can set new goals. We can go

54:28.800 --> 54:34.080
achieve new things. This can be the year and you guys, your whole life can change in a year. You,

54:34.080 --> 54:39.120
you can go from being somebody that's just getting by, having to calculate every time you take a

54:39.120 --> 54:45.600
flight to literally owning the car of your dreams or owning an apartment complex that makes you

54:45.680 --> 54:50.880
a certain amount of money. You guys, these are like, there's so much possibility and it's

54:50.880 --> 54:55.120
fricking insane how much your life can change in one year. We have a new year ahead of us.

54:55.120 --> 54:59.760
Let's not end this year. Just take our foot off the gas, but let's, let's, let's go strong and

54:59.760 --> 55:04.000
let's get our goals done now. Let's not wait till January 31st or December 31st to have our goals.

55:04.640 --> 55:07.440
I hope you guys are pumped. I hope you're excited. We have things that are making this

55:07.440 --> 55:13.840
easier. We have people to show us Ryan Dalton, myself, you know, Mike V, some of these big

55:13.840 --> 55:18.000
players that are making a lot of money that we can look to as examples, look at them for inspiration,

55:18.000 --> 55:22.960
look at them for wisdom, look at them for what to do, what not to do. And just go and eliminate

55:22.960 --> 55:26.240
everything and let's go and fricking do it. By the way, we also have tools that are helping us

55:26.240 --> 55:31.840
rank and run engine, which again, I'll just quickly, if you guys do not and have not already

55:31.840 --> 55:35.760
messaged me for a discount code, if you haven't used one of those already, there's a new code

55:35.760 --> 55:42.320
that Ryan set up. That, that can get so much more work done in such a shorter period of time,

55:42.320 --> 55:46.480
just with the due diligence feature alone. So we have all these things, all these examples,

55:46.480 --> 55:49.760
all this support. We're going to be coming out with a new version of the training that's going

55:49.760 --> 55:54.080
to help us even more with accountability and everything else. A lot of exciting stuff. This

55:54.080 --> 56:01.840
is the greatest business model on the fricking internet, guys. Let's see. Jason says, so how

56:01.840 --> 56:05.680
many carriers these days give away a free phone with new lines and lines are cheap to add?

56:06.320 --> 56:11.920
That's so true, dude. It's actually really true as you can easily do that. Freedom of time.

56:11.920 --> 56:17.200
Leanne says the Opal app blocks anything you want for whatever hours you choose. That's dope.

56:17.200 --> 56:23.360
That's a good little hack ski. Thanks, Leanne. I like that Opal. Also, if you guys don't already

56:24.000 --> 56:28.400
do that, what's this app that I've had on my desktop for however long the,

56:28.400 --> 56:31.920
hold on, I'll tell you exactly what it is. It's called the

56:31.920 --> 56:45.360
the News Feed Eradicator. News Feed Eradicator. I can't even, like if I go to Facebook because

56:45.360 --> 56:51.360
I have to be on Facebook, I can't see my timeline. It gives me some cheesy quote.

56:52.160 --> 56:56.080
I can't see anything. I'm not scrolling because you guys know how easy it is to get it. And by

56:56.080 --> 57:01.760
the way, Jason just said, oh yeah, brick too. By the way, if RIP, if RIP can use a brick phone,

57:01.760 --> 57:09.120
Porter? With a flip phone, dude? You can do a flip phone and your stuff is bad freaking RIP,

57:09.120 --> 57:13.040
you can use a flip phone. Dude, a flip phone's a vibe, dude. I'm going to go back to a Blackberry

57:13.040 --> 57:17.680
at the very minimum. But yeah, Luke says plus one for the News Feed Eradicator. Guys, appreciate

57:17.680 --> 57:21.120
you hopping on. Porter, thanks for hopping on. Sharing some nuggets. Hopefully we didn't come

57:21.120 --> 57:27.200
across a bunch of freaking guru Tony Robbins wannabes. We're just a bunch of, like I said,

57:27.200 --> 57:33.520
country boys with some moderate to crappy education that just are trying to be simple,

57:33.520 --> 57:38.880
trying to make money, trying to make a little dent in this world. And hopefully you guys got

57:38.880 --> 57:41.680
some value from this. So guys, appreciate you being on. Porter, thanks for being on.

57:41.680 --> 57:43.760
We'll see you guys next time. Yeah.
