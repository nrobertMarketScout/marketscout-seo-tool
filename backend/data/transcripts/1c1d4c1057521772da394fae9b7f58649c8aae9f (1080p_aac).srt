00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,760
if nobody answers, would you leave a voicemail? And as long as it was just kind of vague,

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:11,600
you would. Anytime I call leave or call for prospecting, I call twice. I call, hang up,

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:16,720
call again. Because it's like, it's aggressive. It's different. It doesn't look like spam. Like

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:22,000
most spam calls once and they're done. And then I'll leave a voicemail and I'll do a text with

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,640
that same format. Hey, this is so-and-so asking about a job. Give me a call.

6
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,160
Okay.
