Like should you, should you not go into it because do you see a lead generator?

00:03.320 --> 00:04.320
Is that what you're asking?

00:04.320 --> 00:05.320
Yeah, exactly.

00:05.320 --> 00:13.920
Because is there, is there at one point, uh, too many or too much competition?

00:13.920 --> 00:19.160
So here's my theory is like, if, if everything checks out, right.

00:19.160 --> 00:24.880
And I do the due diligence from what we talked about in module one and even with the lead

00:25.480 --> 00:31.560
generators site or their, their organic site and their GMB, I do that sheet and it's still

00:31.560 --> 00:32.560
open.

00:32.560 --> 00:35.060
There's still opportunity to rank.

00:35.060 --> 00:39.840
I could care less if you're a lead generator, if you're yellow pages, if you're Joe Schmo

00:39.840 --> 00:43.040
down the corner, I don't care.

00:43.040 --> 00:48.880
For me personally, I've gotten multiple deals where I've noticed one to two lead generators

00:48.880 --> 00:49.880
sites.

00:49.880 --> 00:53.560
Not only do I see their sites, but they're ranking on page one.

00:53.560 --> 00:55.080
I still go into that niche.

00:55.080 --> 00:56.320
I still build the site.

00:56.320 --> 00:58.640
I still land a client that I've had for over two years.

00:58.640 --> 01:01.240
I can think of two examples of done that.

01:01.240 --> 01:08.560
So now, you know, if, if, if, if the lead generators are the only ones running ads,

01:08.560 --> 01:15.320
that tells me that clearly there's a market because somebody's buying those beats.

01:15.320 --> 01:16.320
Yeah.

01:16.320 --> 01:17.320
Yeah.

01:17.320 --> 01:22.720
It looks like it's going to be like a head on competition.

01:23.400 --> 01:24.400
Yeah.

01:24.400 --> 01:26.840
Well, that's the thing is go back to go back to module one though.

01:26.840 --> 01:27.840
It does.

01:27.840 --> 01:29.200
Does it still check the box?

01:29.200 --> 01:30.200
Are those sites really?

01:30.200 --> 01:31.200
Do they have good?

01:31.200 --> 01:33.160
Do they have good backlinks?

01:33.160 --> 01:34.160
Are they ranked?

01:34.160 --> 01:35.160
No, no, no.

01:35.160 --> 01:42.160
So like the backlinks are not there like the other people in the maps on page one as well.

01:42.160 --> 01:44.360
No, then go for it.

01:44.360 --> 01:45.360
Go for it.

01:45.360 --> 01:46.360
Who gives a shit what they are.

01:46.360 --> 01:47.360
I don't care.

01:47.360 --> 01:48.360
I do not care who you are.

01:48.360 --> 01:50.960
If, if that due diligence part checks out, I'm in.
