Jeff, do you suggest creating a new email to create each new account?

00:04.480 --> 00:09.360
If so, should payments for all those accounts be made with the credit card set up in the MCC?

00:12.640 --> 00:18.320
Okay, so people will tell you that the best practice for with the rank and rent model is yes.

00:20.080 --> 00:23.840
But you can ask Nick, me and some other people that that's not necessary.

00:24.000 --> 00:33.600
I just create for me. If I'm running an MCC, I run, I set up a new account and then one campaign

00:33.600 --> 00:39.760
under that for one website. And then I do that again, multiple times, or like on some of them,

00:39.760 --> 00:45.280
I'm not even turning it. I just don't want them associated with my MCC. And I just have a basic

00:45.280 --> 00:51.280
Google profile and I go in and I add account and I set it up for one website. And then I go add

00:52.000 --> 00:56.640
account and I set up and I'm kind of running MCC, but it's just all on the right underneath the

00:56.640 --> 01:01.680
little profile circle of yours. So it's not necessary. It doesn't mean I'm not going to get

01:01.680 --> 01:06.240
flagged, but it's just, I don't necessarily need it right now. Yeah. I don't think there's any,

01:06.240 --> 01:11.280
I know in Russ, I think Russ ether over in Australia, when we did a one point,

01:11.280 --> 01:16.240
Oh, we talked a lot about that. I don't know. I don't think it's going to hurt,

01:16.240 --> 01:20.160
but I don't think it's necessary. And so if you want to add that layer, great.

01:20.160 --> 01:22.880
But again, I've never done that and I've never had a problem.
