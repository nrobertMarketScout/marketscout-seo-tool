00:00.000 --> 00:07.360
Guys, welcome to this little impromptu live that I'm running.

00:07.360 --> 00:12.080
I didn't plan on doing this, but I wanted to share a couple things.

00:12.080 --> 00:18.120
So I didn't make any kind of an announcement in terms of me going live or anything like

00:18.120 --> 00:19.120
that.

00:19.120 --> 00:20.120
Okay.

00:20.120 --> 00:23.600
So what I wanted to share really, really quick, by the way, it's December 2nd.

00:23.600 --> 00:28.040
We have takeout Christmas and New Year's Eve and Christmas Eve.

00:28.040 --> 00:32.960
We have like three, a little over three weeks of working time left in this year.

00:32.960 --> 00:40.000
And you know, a lot of people in this group, a lot of people in business in general, a

00:40.000 --> 00:44.080
lot of our clients are a lot of people that we want to work with or potentially work with.

00:44.080 --> 00:47.360
They might be just like taking their foot off the gas.

00:47.360 --> 00:51.680
And so this is a time where you can either take your foot off the gas, which if that's

00:51.680 --> 00:54.520
what you choose to do, that's completely fine.

00:54.560 --> 00:58.160
I used to be so frustrated when I would think about people doing this.

00:58.160 --> 01:03.440
But this business, we do this business so that we can choose the kind of life and lifestyle

01:03.440 --> 01:04.440
that we want.

01:04.440 --> 01:06.000
So I have no problems with that if that's what you choose to do.

01:06.000 --> 01:10.160
But for some of us, like myself, I'm trying to put my foot on the gas.

01:10.160 --> 01:15.920
I'm trying to go as fast as possible to the very, very end so that I start the year now.

01:15.920 --> 01:16.920
Okay.

01:16.920 --> 01:17.920
So let me go ahead.

01:17.920 --> 01:18.920
I want to tag everyone real quick.

01:18.920 --> 01:19.920
Let's go like this.

01:19.920 --> 01:20.920
Come quick.

01:21.320 --> 01:22.320
Come quick.

01:22.320 --> 01:23.320
That's what I said.

01:23.320 --> 01:26.320
So I just barely got done this morning.

01:26.320 --> 01:27.320
I woke up.

01:27.320 --> 01:31.760
One of the things I wanted to do that was on my priorities this week and as like one

01:31.760 --> 01:38.240
of my to-do's this week that I needed to get done is I wanted to go and review my goals,

01:38.240 --> 01:39.240
my 2024 goals.

01:39.240 --> 01:44.520
Now, the first thing, the first problem with this and what I just said is the fact that

01:44.520 --> 01:49.200
I needed to go and review, which means that it's been a long time since I've done this.

01:49.760 --> 01:56.440
And I'm going to be completely transparent with you guys.

01:56.440 --> 02:01.080
I think it was, man, at the beginning of this year, I was, make sure you're checking your

02:01.080 --> 02:03.080
goals every once in the morning, once at night.

02:03.080 --> 02:08.060
I think we had Zach Powell on, I think it was like when I was in Africa about the spring

02:08.060 --> 02:09.560
or something like that.

02:09.560 --> 02:13.760
And he was talking about checking your goals every six hours.

02:13.760 --> 02:14.760
And I love that.

02:14.760 --> 02:16.400
I love that idea of that.

02:16.400 --> 02:17.840
And I did it for a while.

02:17.840 --> 02:21.680
And then I got off path and I got off track and I got distracted.

02:21.680 --> 02:25.080
And anyway, today, it's kind of like, I don't know if you guys have ever been in a position

02:25.080 --> 02:31.680
where you know that your bank account isn't great and you like avoid looking at it, even

02:31.680 --> 02:32.800
though you know what's in it.

02:32.800 --> 02:33.800
You don't want to look at it.

02:33.800 --> 02:40.840
I remember back in 2019, 2018, I hated logging into my account because it just kind of highlighted

02:40.840 --> 02:44.240
the fact that I was in such a bad situation.

02:44.240 --> 02:48.640
And then once I got in there, it was manageable, but it was always like I was trying to avoid

02:48.640 --> 02:49.640
it.

02:49.640 --> 02:53.120
So anyway, today I knew I was like, I got to get down, I got to look at my goals, see

02:53.120 --> 02:56.200
where I'm at, see how I can course correct, et cetera.

02:56.200 --> 02:57.560
And that's what I did.

02:57.560 --> 03:01.840
So a couple of things that I learned while going through those, and the reason I want

03:01.840 --> 03:05.040
to come and talk about this now is everybody waits until the first of the year to set their

03:05.040 --> 03:07.080
goals.

03:07.080 --> 03:12.740
And then the irony is we set the goals on December 25th, September 26, between Christmas

03:12.740 --> 03:13.740
and New Year's.

03:13.740 --> 03:16.780
And then everybody goes out on New Year's Eve, they get completely drunk, smashed, and

03:16.780 --> 03:19.820
they start the year with a hangover, right?

03:19.820 --> 03:21.540
And that's, it's crazy.

03:21.540 --> 03:24.380
And by the weekend, no one's going to the gym, no one's doing anything, no one's making

03:24.380 --> 03:28.060
their calls, no one's doing their due diligence, no one's doing any of this stuff.

03:28.060 --> 03:33.900
So what I want to do before the beginning of the year comes, I want to get my goals

03:33.900 --> 03:36.620
in place right now and start working towards them now.

03:36.620 --> 03:39.320
So I have a jumpstart in everybody else.

03:39.320 --> 03:42.100
But a couple of things that I learned and I encourage you guys to go look at the goals

03:42.140 --> 03:45.740
that you set early 2024 and just review them.

03:45.740 --> 03:49.140
And it hopefully some of you guys had a phenomenal year.

03:49.380 --> 03:52.420
Hopefully some of you guys like really, really crushed it and you stuck to your goals.

03:52.420 --> 03:57.020
And the disappointing part, guys, at least for me with looking at my goals.

03:57.020 --> 03:58.860
And there was a couple that I hit for sure.

03:59.100 --> 04:03.220
And there was a couple. The ones that I hit were not even ones that I was really that

04:03.220 --> 04:08.580
excited about or expecting to hit, but with a change of fate and a twist of destiny,

04:08.580 --> 04:11.820
I guess, I decided to pick up my slack in some of these areas.

04:12.100 --> 04:18.940
But the crazy part is what I started realizing as I was going through my goals is that at

04:18.940 --> 04:23.100
the beginning of the year, 2024, I set my goal and then I created the map.

04:23.100 --> 04:24.980
Just like when you guys join this group, right?

04:24.980 --> 04:26.580
You you create you set your goal.

04:27.340 --> 04:31.660
And then if you watch exhaustive and satisfied, you go through and it shows you

04:31.660 --> 04:34.740
exactly how to create your map to get to the goal.

04:35.020 --> 04:37.420
And you do this for every single one of your goals.

04:37.420 --> 04:39.780
It doesn't matter if it's a fitness goal, doesn't matter if it's a spiritual goal.

04:39.780 --> 04:41.260
It doesn't matter if it's a relationship goal.

04:41.260 --> 04:42.540
It doesn't matter if it's a business goal.

04:42.780 --> 04:44.020
It's the same formula.

04:44.180 --> 04:47.820
You break it down into quarters and then in the months and then in the weeks, then in

04:47.820 --> 04:49.700
the days and then sometimes in the hours.

04:49.740 --> 04:50.980
And you go and you attack it.

04:52.740 --> 04:57.420
And once you set the goal, all you have to do and you set the goal, you set the map,

04:57.420 --> 04:59.700
you set like your exact roadmap to get there.

04:59.980 --> 05:04.860
All you have to go is it all you have to go and do is just do exactly what's on the

05:04.860 --> 05:06.820
map. You just have to follow the map.

05:07.060 --> 05:12.820
If it says that on Tuesday, December or whatever, you need to do five cold calls or

05:12.820 --> 05:16.460
you need to talk to five business owners, that's what you have to do, even if you

05:16.460 --> 05:17.460
don't feel like it. Right.

05:17.620 --> 05:22.060
Just like the example I always use, if you're in, you know, New York and you want to

05:22.060 --> 05:26.620
get to Los Angeles, you got a map and you know exactly how to get there by.

05:27.980 --> 05:31.900
January 4th, you know how many miles you need to you need to travel, you know which

05:31.900 --> 05:34.940
states you need to go through, you know where you can stop, where your breaks for

05:34.940 --> 05:36.900
the bathroom, where your breaks to eat, to sleep, et cetera.

05:36.900 --> 05:39.180
You have this entire map laid out and all you got to do is do the map.

05:39.420 --> 05:40.820
But the problem is we get distracted.

05:40.820 --> 05:41.900
The problem is we get tired.

05:41.900 --> 05:44.900
The problem is we get, you know, oh, let me go do this.

05:44.900 --> 05:46.540
Let me check out this. Let me go to this state.

05:46.540 --> 05:50.100
Look at this. And that's equivalent to us in this business like, oh, I'm going to

05:50.100 --> 05:51.820
start this thing. I'm going to go and do this.

05:51.820 --> 05:55.220
I'm going to do that. That trip that's going to come before hitting my goals.

05:56.460 --> 05:59.540
So to me, I sat there today and I was like, I set all these goals at the beginning of

05:59.540 --> 06:01.300
the year. The year passed.

06:01.300 --> 06:05.660
This is the part that's like really, really kind of a slap in the face, guys, is

06:05.660 --> 06:07.620
that the year passed, right?

06:07.620 --> 06:11.020
Eleven months has passed since we set these goals, almost 12 months.

06:12.180 --> 06:15.940
And there's somebody out there that created a million dollars for themselves, a

06:15.940 --> 06:16.940
new million dollars.

06:16.940 --> 06:19.340
There's somebody out there that became a millionaire this year.

06:19.340 --> 06:21.980
There's somebody out there that probably for sure that became a billionaire.

06:21.980 --> 06:25.300
There's somebody out there that got the body that they have been waiting their

06:25.300 --> 06:28.380
whole lives to get. There's somebody out there that created the relationship that

06:28.380 --> 06:30.820
they've waited their entire lives to create.

06:30.820 --> 06:34.180
And then there's some of us or some of you.

06:35.180 --> 06:39.060
And I would speak for us in general that like we were in the same spot we were

06:39.060 --> 06:40.500
last year. Right.

06:40.500 --> 06:45.380
And it's weird because even if you improve incrementally.

06:47.100 --> 06:51.900
The improvement from last year to this year feels better than staying the same as

06:51.900 --> 06:55.900
last year, even if even if your last year was better than than my last year, for

06:55.900 --> 07:00.820
example. And I remember this because me going from eight to ten thousand dollars

07:00.820 --> 07:04.020
a month, negative sixty thousand dollars in debt to making my first million

07:04.020 --> 07:06.700
dollars. That was the best thing ever.

07:06.780 --> 07:09.660
Right. That was the best thing ever because I increased.

07:09.820 --> 07:14.540
I did. Now, from twenty twenty to twenty twenty one, we made more money on a

07:14.540 --> 07:16.620
gross level, but I spent more money as well.

07:16.620 --> 07:18.860
And I didn't really make much more money in my pocket.

07:18.860 --> 07:22.420
So for twenty twenty to twenty twenty one, I made almost half a million dollars

07:22.420 --> 07:26.900
more. I made one point four or five something million dollars, one point four or

07:26.900 --> 07:29.220
five one. And by the way, this is not the course.

07:29.220 --> 07:30.900
This is just with lead generation.

07:31.140 --> 07:33.940
I made almost a half a million dollars more than I did in twenty twenty.

07:34.140 --> 07:36.540
But I put the almost the exact same amount in my pocket.

07:36.820 --> 07:41.340
And I wasn't near as excited at all about that because I didn't really improve.

07:41.580 --> 07:44.700
But going from twenty nineteen from eight to ten thousand dollars a month, barely

07:44.700 --> 07:47.700
making it to getting to a million dollars was phenomenal.

07:47.700 --> 07:49.260
Right. Because I improved.

07:49.660 --> 07:54.220
So anyway, all this to say, guys, what I encourage you guys to do before it becomes

07:54.220 --> 07:59.180
the first of the year becomes Christmas and we've got like four days, five days and

07:59.180 --> 08:02.940
everyone's, you know, cold and drinking spiked eggnog.

08:03.260 --> 08:08.940
Why don't we spend time right now, early December, spend time this week reviewing

08:08.940 --> 08:10.780
your goals. Look at where you messed up.

08:10.780 --> 08:12.780
Where did you get off track? What was it that happened?

08:12.780 --> 08:14.300
What what derailed you?

08:14.300 --> 08:17.940
What at what point did you decide to take a different route than the route that was

08:17.940 --> 08:21.740
going to get you to the Los Angeles or the Miami, which is your ultimate goal?

08:21.940 --> 08:25.140
Because all you would have had to do, this is me speaking to myself, is follow the

08:25.140 --> 08:28.420
freaking map, Nick, and you could have been to that goal.

08:28.500 --> 08:29.220
You could have done this thing.

08:29.220 --> 08:32.500
Guys, there was things I was so excited about that I completely got derailed.

08:32.660 --> 08:35.460
And I used personal issues in my life.

08:35.620 --> 08:36.740
Oh, but I'm dealing with this.

08:36.740 --> 08:38.300
Oh, but I got this relationship thing.

08:38.300 --> 08:39.580
Oh, but I got this family thing.

08:39.580 --> 08:41.100
Oh, but I'm here. I'm there.

08:41.100 --> 08:42.500
This, that and the rest.

08:42.500 --> 08:45.860
This happened. Yeah, guys, I got things happen, man.

08:45.860 --> 08:49.620
I had some stuff that I had to take care of, some like legal stuff that was

08:49.780 --> 08:52.060
complete, I think, complete BS.

08:52.060 --> 08:53.220
It's completely handled.

08:53.220 --> 08:57.220
It was it was it was basically a competitor that went and found a loophole.

08:57.220 --> 09:01.140
And anyway, long story short, we dealt with that all year and last year.

09:01.300 --> 09:04.900
And at times when I wasn't, you know, making that progress to my towards my goals,

09:04.900 --> 09:05.820
I was using that.

09:05.820 --> 09:07.220
Some of you guys have a sick pair.

09:07.220 --> 09:08.740
Some of you guys are in the middle of a divorce.

09:08.740 --> 09:10.420
Some of you guys have custody issues.

09:10.420 --> 09:12.340
We all have stuff.

09:12.340 --> 09:15.700
And it's just like when you take a road trip, everyone has car issues.

09:15.780 --> 09:17.220
Everyone has the flat tire.

09:17.220 --> 09:18.260
Everyone has this thing.

09:18.260 --> 09:20.220
And you have to just realize those things are going to come.

09:20.220 --> 09:21.660
But you got to stay on track.

09:21.660 --> 09:23.700
And if those things come, you got to make up for it.

09:23.980 --> 09:28.220
So, my friends, one thing that I was just going to throw out there,

09:28.220 --> 09:30.820
one thing that I'm thinking about this year is as I'm writing down my goals

09:30.820 --> 09:32.700
and I'm writing down my goals in four different categories,

09:32.700 --> 09:35.220
we're going to have probably an entire live on goal setting

09:35.420 --> 09:36.980
because I think it's super, super important.

09:36.980 --> 09:39.340
I know it can become mundane and whatever.

09:39.620 --> 09:42.820
But it's very, very important to write it down and to keep reviewing it.

09:43.700 --> 09:46.140
One of the things I started thinking today as I was writing down my goals,

09:46.140 --> 09:47.340
I was looking at last year's goals.

09:47.340 --> 09:50.340
I'm like, how do I want to take any of those and bring them into this year?

09:50.540 --> 09:52.300
Do I want to start completely fresh?

09:52.300 --> 09:55.020
And I started thinking, you know, a couple of years ago,

09:55.220 --> 09:59.860
when we talked about goals, I would talk to people about the the goal

10:00.060 --> 10:03.340
and then the die goal or the junkie goal, the goal.

10:03.340 --> 10:07.460
That's like, hey, if I don't hit this, I'm going to do something crazy.

10:07.460 --> 10:10.140
I'm going to I'm going to put an embarrassing picture of myself on the Internet.

10:10.140 --> 10:11.740
I'm going to give away ten thousand dollars.

10:11.740 --> 10:14.420
I'm going to do something very, very crazy.

10:14.420 --> 10:16.820
I'm going to publicly humiliate myself if it doesn't happen.

10:17.140 --> 10:19.340
And I also call it the junkie goal. Right.

10:20.140 --> 10:25.580
And the analogy with the junkie is that for some reason, the junkie,

10:25.580 --> 10:28.780
the guy on the street, the gal on the street that needs the heroin hit

10:28.780 --> 10:32.020
or whatever in their arm, they always find a way to get the hit.

10:32.020 --> 10:33.940
They always find a way to get the needle in their arm.

10:33.940 --> 10:36.260
They have no money. They have no home. They have no clothes.

10:36.260 --> 10:38.340
They barely are breathing.

10:38.380 --> 10:41.940
Yet somehow, someway, whether it's diving for tin cans

10:42.100 --> 10:46.940
to go collect enough money to get enough to buy the hit, they always find a way.

10:46.940 --> 10:48.620
Maybe it's sometimes it's not great.

10:48.620 --> 10:49.500
Sometimes it's stealing.

10:49.500 --> 10:52.340
Sometimes it's it's doing some very heinous things,

10:52.620 --> 10:56.060
but they always find a way to get the hit.

10:56.220 --> 11:00.180
And it's like we for some reason just treat our stuff so casually.

11:00.180 --> 11:02.780
We need to treat it. We need to become junkies in a way.

11:02.780 --> 11:05.780
And that sounds so weird and it sounds kind of backwards.

11:05.780 --> 11:08.700
But we we should learn from these people, man.

11:08.700 --> 11:13.580
They figure out a way no matter what comes to to to get to their goals.

11:13.580 --> 11:16.100
And so this year, what I want to do, Stephanie, what's going on?

11:16.100 --> 11:17.980
Good to see you, Bruce. What's going on, Richard?

11:17.980 --> 11:21.340
Of course, this year, what I want to do is I'm setting die goals.

11:21.340 --> 11:22.580
I'm setting junkie goals.

11:22.580 --> 11:25.500
I'm setting goals of like I'm willing.

11:25.500 --> 11:27.980
The goals that I'm going to set this year are goals that I'm willing

11:27.980 --> 11:31.020
to post publicly so that people can hold me accountable,

11:31.740 --> 11:34.780
which means I'm going to think about it a couple of times

11:35.500 --> 11:38.500
before I just throw it on my list of like, yeah, I'm going to do this.

11:38.500 --> 11:40.780
I'm going to run the, you know, the Boston Marathon.

11:40.940 --> 11:42.260
I'm going to qualify for the Boston Marathon.

11:42.260 --> 11:46.500
I'm going to run a sub three, three mile, three hour marathon.

11:46.740 --> 11:50.020
Right. Like, I'm going to think about that before I go and throw that up.

11:50.020 --> 11:52.900
And one thing that I'm really considering and I might ask you guys

11:52.900 --> 11:56.580
to do the same or consider the same is like as you're going through your goals,

11:56.580 --> 11:58.580
you're reviewing last year and you're looking at this year.

11:59.580 --> 12:02.180
What if your goals were public?

12:02.180 --> 12:05.460
What if the things that you're you're writing down were there for everybody

12:05.460 --> 12:07.860
to see and everybody could hold you accountable?

12:07.980 --> 12:10.180
How would you change it? I'm not saying to think smaller.

12:10.180 --> 12:14.860
I'm saying what I'm saying to think very seriously about what you write down

12:14.860 --> 12:18.100
this year. OK, because what I know, guys, is this.

12:19.940 --> 12:22.460
It takes one good year.

12:23.540 --> 12:26.580
It takes one. Put your head in the sand.

12:26.820 --> 12:27.780
Put nothing in the sand.

12:27.780 --> 12:29.940
Put your head down, put your blinders on, get to work.

12:30.100 --> 12:33.060
And guys, in one year, your entire life can change.

12:36.380 --> 12:39.540
One year, I watched it in 2019.

12:39.540 --> 12:42.100
My life was the same. It wasn't 18. It was the same in 17.

12:42.260 --> 12:45.060
It was a little bit better in 17 than it was in 16 because I was broke.

12:45.180 --> 12:47.340
But in 16, it was far worse than it was in 15.

12:47.540 --> 12:49.660
My life didn't change for a long time.

12:49.740 --> 12:52.460
And then guess what? In 2020, I figured it out.

12:52.540 --> 12:54.820
I removed the distractions. I got simple.

12:54.820 --> 12:56.220
I got very basic.

12:56.220 --> 13:00.980
I got Mr. Scrappy McScrappy, where I didn't care about how I looked.

13:01.100 --> 13:03.100
I didn't care about being out with the boys.

13:03.100 --> 13:06.500
I didn't care about playing pickleball, playing golf, being at lunches,

13:06.580 --> 13:08.700
watching Netflix. I was there to make money.

13:08.700 --> 13:12.500
I was so sick and tired of being broke and having a credit card credit card

13:12.500 --> 13:15.180
desk sitting on my desk, looking me in the face that I was like, I'm done.

13:16.540 --> 13:19.100
And within eight months, I was at one hundred thousand dollars per month.

13:19.340 --> 13:23.860
And within 12 months, I was I made my first million dollars,

13:23.900 --> 13:26.180
paid off my debt, was looking at my first rental properties,

13:26.660 --> 13:28.900
looking at it. I think I was in a new house at that point.

13:29.380 --> 13:30.500
My entire life changed.

13:30.500 --> 13:34.660
And more than just the money that I made in that year, guys, was my identity changed.

13:34.820 --> 13:38.260
And one thing that I've realized is that once you get to a certain level in business,

13:38.660 --> 13:41.260
a certain level in income, this is not an analogy that I came up with.

13:41.260 --> 13:44.220
I think it was probably Brian Tracy and then it was probably Jim Rohn.

13:44.220 --> 13:46.260
And then it was probably one of these other gurus.

13:46.260 --> 13:49.300
But they talk about this thermostat that we have, this financial thermostat,

13:49.300 --> 13:53.500
where once we hit a certain level, we become comfortable at that level.

13:53.660 --> 13:54.860
And we can't go below it.

13:54.860 --> 13:56.900
And if we do, the heat kicks on. Right.

13:56.900 --> 14:00.180
It can also work against us, because as we if we have a really good year,

14:00.180 --> 14:01.180
we make a lot of money.

14:01.180 --> 14:03.660
Sometimes negatively, we kick on the AC.

14:03.660 --> 14:05.940
We come back down to where we're comfortable.

14:05.940 --> 14:09.820
But one thing I've learned about about myself and my identity

14:09.820 --> 14:12.700
is that once I made a million dollars, once I became one hundred thousand dollar

14:12.700 --> 14:15.100
per month person, I can never go back.

14:15.100 --> 14:18.420
I will never make less than a million dollars.

14:18.420 --> 14:20.860
I just can't. I just can't.

14:20.860 --> 14:23.140
Like, it's who I am. It's my identity.

14:23.140 --> 14:26.940
I'm not saying that my my entire self worth is tied to it.

14:27.740 --> 14:30.060
But I do not make less than a million dollars.

14:30.580 --> 14:33.180
That is like the that is the the floor.

14:33.340 --> 14:34.780
And I will never go less than a million dollars.

14:34.780 --> 14:36.620
I can't imagine making less than a million dollars.

14:36.620 --> 14:38.380
And I don't say that like one of these weird people

14:38.380 --> 14:40.260
that's trying to act like they're super rich.

14:40.260 --> 14:42.460
I'm not the top of any totem pole.

14:42.460 --> 14:46.740
It's just it's interesting because, guys, if you will just claw your way

14:47.100 --> 14:50.700
to one hundred thousand dollars per month and see what it's like to be at one

14:50.700 --> 14:52.580
hundred thousand, some of you guys are like, that's not very much.

14:52.580 --> 14:55.060
A lot of you guys are like, that's that'd be amazing.

14:55.300 --> 14:56.500
OK, get to one hundred thousand.

14:56.500 --> 14:58.580
See how it feels. Then get to a quarter million.

14:58.580 --> 15:00.060
See what life's like at a quarter million.

15:00.060 --> 15:01.380
You're never going to go below it.

15:01.380 --> 15:02.620
Get to a half a million.

15:02.620 --> 15:04.620
Get to seven hundred and fifty thousand, three quarter million.

15:04.620 --> 15:05.620
Get to a million dollars.

15:05.620 --> 15:08.740
Get to a hundred thousand dollars per month and see what life's like.

15:08.980 --> 15:10.420
You will never want to go back.

15:10.420 --> 15:12.900
OK, it will completely change your identity.

15:12.900 --> 15:14.460
People will start to talk to you differently.

15:14.460 --> 15:15.620
People will start to respect you more.

15:15.620 --> 15:17.620
People will start to take you more seriously.

15:17.740 --> 15:18.660
Doors will be open to you.

15:18.660 --> 15:21.540
People will start reaching out to you to to pick your brain.

15:21.540 --> 15:23.540
Instead of you always reaching out to pick up the people's brain.

15:23.740 --> 15:26.340
By the way, I hate that sentence.

15:26.340 --> 15:27.500
Everything changes.

15:27.500 --> 15:31.100
And what I'm sitting here and trying to speak,

15:31.100 --> 15:34.140
I'm basically just sharing my thoughts out loud because I'm talking to myself

15:34.140 --> 15:39.380
as I'm thinking through this day, is everything can change in a year.

15:39.700 --> 15:41.460
Your entire life can change in a year.

15:41.460 --> 15:44.100
And right now, guys, I feel like I'm in a decent spot.

15:44.780 --> 15:47.700
Financially, I've been in a pretty good spot for a bit,

15:48.300 --> 15:49.460
but I'm not satisfied at all.

15:49.460 --> 15:52.700
In fact, I'm disgusted with the progress that I've made.

15:53.900 --> 15:58.460
If I look at the progress I made from 19 to 20, compared with 23 to 24,

15:58.460 --> 16:01.620
I'm disgusted because it hasn't been much.

16:01.620 --> 16:02.620
It's been incremental.

16:02.620 --> 16:07.380
And yes, it's at a much higher level than it was in 2019 compared to 2020.

16:07.740 --> 16:11.180
But man, I'm just pissing my life away if I'm looking at it.

16:11.180 --> 16:13.660
If I'm being very, very honest, I just made a post about this on Instagram

16:13.660 --> 16:17.180
and Facebook about like this year, I'm going to just level with you guys.

16:18.020 --> 16:21.180
A lot of the decisions I made, I know nothing was crazy,

16:21.180 --> 16:24.100
but like I made a lot of decisions that were very temporary in the moment.

16:24.100 --> 16:26.700
Like I chose, I put this, I chose comfort over calling.

16:26.700 --> 16:29.540
I chose temporary satisfaction.

16:29.540 --> 16:33.540
I chose temporary pleasure over long term satisfaction

16:34.140 --> 16:37.860
in a lot of different areas of my life, in a lot of different moments of my life,

16:37.860 --> 16:39.940
a lot of different months.

16:39.940 --> 16:42.460
Now, it wasn't the entire year, but a lot of the year.

16:42.460 --> 16:44.900
And because of that, I came short on a lot of stuff.

16:45.100 --> 16:47.260
And I'm here being straight, completely honest with you guys.

16:47.900 --> 16:49.980
And again, I even said this on my post.

16:49.980 --> 16:52.580
I am not, this isn't a woe me, this isn't a downer.

16:52.580 --> 16:54.100
I'm super excited.

16:54.100 --> 16:55.580
I hope you guys can feel my energy.

16:55.580 --> 17:03.060
I spent about an hour and 10 minutes today on version 3.0.

17:03.060 --> 17:07.100
And I'm going to spend another hour and a half, hour to hour and a half tomorrow.

17:07.100 --> 17:09.940
Guys, I'm so pumped about 3.0 and what it's going to look like.

17:09.940 --> 17:12.620
Now, I don't want you guys, when's that going to come out?

17:12.620 --> 17:14.580
It's going to be out before the end of quarter one.

17:14.580 --> 17:16.500
I'm making sure this thing is so dialed in.

17:16.500 --> 17:18.580
Now, a lot of the, and we'll get into more of the details there,

17:18.580 --> 17:22.740
but like, I'm so pumped about what we have or what's coming for you guys.

17:22.740 --> 17:25.460
And I'm so pumped about those of you that just started,

17:25.460 --> 17:28.660
because you guys have something at your fingertips that you can go

17:28.660 --> 17:30.340
and you can escape the rat race with this.

17:30.340 --> 17:31.540
Your entire freaking life.

17:31.540 --> 17:36.020
I'm texting one of my buddies right now, who's just about to become a digital landlord.

17:36.020 --> 17:37.620
And he's kind of been on the fence for a while.

17:37.620 --> 17:39.380
I'm super stoked. I hope he watches this video,

17:40.500 --> 17:42.260
because we've been talking for months.

17:42.260 --> 17:44.100
And he's like, I need to do something. I need to do something.

17:44.100 --> 17:47.140
Guys, you have the tool in front of you.

17:47.140 --> 17:52.980
You have the, literally, you have the thing that can get you to whatever you want to do.

17:52.980 --> 17:55.460
And I used to think everyone should become this, you know,

17:55.460 --> 17:57.300
let's get to a million dollars a month, every single person.

17:57.300 --> 17:58.500
That's not for everybody.

17:58.500 --> 18:00.420
But every single person should escape the rat race.

18:00.420 --> 18:05.620
Every single person should be able to live on, you know,

18:05.620 --> 18:10.260
money that comes in from assets that they've built and ranked and rented from this business.

18:11.060 --> 18:12.340
You've paid to be here.

18:12.340 --> 18:13.700
The business works.

18:13.700 --> 18:15.460
It's working for me. It's working for Jason.

18:15.460 --> 18:16.340
It's working for Porter.

18:16.340 --> 18:20.740
It's working for, I just got a message from Drew Wolber, by the way.

18:20.740 --> 18:26.980
And Drew Wolber just barely hit $50,000 per month.

18:27.940 --> 18:29.860
Okay, $50,000 per month.

18:29.860 --> 18:31.860
I don't even know when he started, but it wasn't that long ago.

18:31.860 --> 18:32.900
It was like 18 months ago.

18:32.900 --> 18:34.180
He's at $50,000 per month.

18:34.980 --> 18:38.180
He's trying to be on, he's trying to be on Ryan Dalton's heels.

18:38.180 --> 18:41.700
Okay, guys, your entire life can change in one year.

18:41.700 --> 18:44.020
So what I'm asking you guys to do is before the end of the year comes,

18:44.020 --> 18:45.220
we're going to do some more goal setting.

18:45.220 --> 18:46.500
We'll do another live on goal setting.

18:46.500 --> 18:47.940
Maybe I'll walk you through how I'm going to do mine.

18:47.940 --> 18:49.300
Maybe I'll walk you through mine live.

18:49.300 --> 18:49.700
I don't know.

18:50.260 --> 18:52.660
But what I'm asking you to do is before we get to Christmas,

18:52.660 --> 18:54.980
and there's that little week after Christmas between New Year's,

18:54.980 --> 18:58.020
when we're trying to rush our goals and we spend 30 minutes on them,

18:58.020 --> 18:59.540
take time right now, review.

18:59.540 --> 19:00.580
Look where you came short.

19:00.580 --> 19:01.380
How did you get short?

19:01.380 --> 19:02.340
Where did you get distracted?

19:02.340 --> 19:03.540
What distracted you?

19:03.540 --> 19:04.420
Was it worth it?

19:04.420 --> 19:05.380
I'm sure it wasn't.

19:05.380 --> 19:09.700
Okay, but look at what you traded this year instead of your goals.

19:09.700 --> 19:10.820
Look at what you chose.

19:10.820 --> 19:14.260
Look at the temporary pleasures and distractions you chose this year

19:14.260 --> 19:15.780
instead of achieving your goals.

19:15.780 --> 19:19.060
Because right now, every single one of us could sit here and be like,

19:19.060 --> 19:19.940
I got that one done.

19:19.940 --> 19:20.660
I got that one done.

19:20.660 --> 19:21.220
I got that one done.

19:21.220 --> 19:21.780
I got that one done.

19:21.780 --> 19:23.060
We'd have the biggest smile on our face.

19:23.060 --> 19:24.500
We'd have the most satisfaction ever.

19:24.500 --> 19:29.780
Guys, back to my live on exhausted but satisfied.

19:29.780 --> 19:31.380
That is the thing that you want to chase.

19:31.380 --> 19:33.060
That is the thing that's going to be with you forever,

19:33.060 --> 19:37.860
is those moments when you do hard things that you don't think you can do

19:37.940 --> 19:42.100
and you pull them off and you have the most satisfied freaking feeling in the world.

19:42.100 --> 19:43.700
I'm reading this book right now.

19:43.700 --> 19:47.220
It's about this guy that bought this freaking gold rush town in California.

19:47.220 --> 19:50.180
And he talks about like he's out there working with his hands

19:50.180 --> 19:53.460
and he just bought this entire town for just under a million bucks.

19:53.460 --> 19:55.460
And he's like, I read this line.

19:55.460 --> 19:56.500
I highlighted it last night.

19:56.500 --> 19:58.100
I was reading it as I went to bed.

19:58.100 --> 20:02.660
And he said, I went to bed, my body went to bed exhausted,

20:02.660 --> 20:04.660
but my mind went to bed at peace.

20:05.380 --> 20:09.140
My body went to bed exhausted, but my mind went to bed at peace.

20:09.860 --> 20:10.820
That's how I want to live.

20:12.340 --> 20:14.180
Every single day, I want to be freaking exhausted.

20:14.180 --> 20:16.260
Even if it's mentally, I'm probably not going to be super tired

20:16.260 --> 20:20.580
sitting in my chair every single day building websites, talking on the phone.

20:20.580 --> 20:23.940
I'm not out there working with my hands, but it still is tiring.

20:23.940 --> 20:26.260
And I might be mentally exhausted, but I want to have peace.

20:26.260 --> 20:29.060
When I hit the pillow, I want to know I gave every single thing that I could give

20:29.060 --> 20:30.660
and I move that needle closer.

20:30.740 --> 20:35.140
So I'm basically doing this live for me to go back and look at later

20:35.700 --> 20:36.740
to see where I was at.

20:36.740 --> 20:38.980
But I thought that I'd share it instead of just keeping it within,

20:38.980 --> 20:42.580
instead of just putting it in my journal, which I will do as well.

20:42.580 --> 20:45.300
I wanted you guys to know that today I went through, I reviewed my goals.

20:45.300 --> 20:48.020
I came up big time short, big time short.

20:48.020 --> 20:48.660
Doesn't even make sense.

20:48.660 --> 20:49.940
I came up short, big time.

20:50.820 --> 20:51.700
It wasn't my year.

20:51.700 --> 20:52.740
It wasn't my year at all.

20:52.740 --> 20:58.020
I traded a lot of things I could have achieved and I regret that very, very much.

20:58.580 --> 20:59.220
But you know what?

20:59.220 --> 21:00.020
You can't look at the past.

21:00.420 --> 21:00.820
Whatever.

21:00.820 --> 21:01.700
It's time to move forward.

21:01.700 --> 21:04.740
Instead of waiting until January 1st and just pissing away the rest of here,

21:04.740 --> 21:05.700
I'm ready to start now.

21:05.700 --> 21:06.580
It's December 2nd.

21:06.580 --> 21:08.260
It's cold, baby.

21:08.260 --> 21:13.220
But luckily we work inside so I can wear a cutoff digital landlord's shirt.

21:13.220 --> 21:16.500
But it's cold outside and that doesn't mean I'm not going to be working.

21:17.300 --> 21:19.220
So guys, go and review your goals.

21:19.220 --> 21:19.860
I'm stoked.

21:19.860 --> 21:21.300
We got a live coming tomorrow.

21:21.300 --> 21:22.420
Me and Zach Powell are going live.

21:22.420 --> 21:26.500
We're going to be talking about leverage, how you can leverage yourself

21:26.500 --> 21:29.620
and create a beautiful team that can help you grow.

21:29.620 --> 21:31.620
By the way, you don't need a teaser.

21:31.620 --> 21:35.540
You don't need that many people to create a seven-figure business in this business

21:35.540 --> 21:37.060
and you don't need to pay that much in payroll

21:37.060 --> 21:40.740
because we have things like onlinejobs.ph and all these different tools.

21:40.740 --> 21:41.860
But guys, get on that live.

21:41.860 --> 21:44.260
Zach Powell's making over $50,000 per month.

21:44.260 --> 21:45.860
He's been doing this for a long time as well.

21:46.900 --> 21:51.060
Super solid guy, amazing business owner, amazing entrepreneur,

21:51.060 --> 21:51.940
and I'm super stoked for that.

21:51.940 --> 21:55.060
So 7 a.m. MST for those of you that are on MST.

21:55.060 --> 21:56.660
Otherwise, do your calculations, guys.

21:56.660 --> 21:58.660
I am going to go be with my kids

21:59.220 --> 22:01.460
and then get back in the saddle.

22:01.460 --> 22:02.500
Back in the saddle, baby.

22:02.500 --> 22:02.900
I'm out.

22:02.900 --> 22:04.500
Talk to you guys tomorrow.
