1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,880
Alright, so now we're going to buy our domain for our website.

2
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:16,440
We usually use GoDaddy, I know there's tons of other options you can have, so pick whatever

3
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,440
you like.

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,640
I'm just showing you again what we use.

5
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:24,760
So once you create an account, you are going to search for your domain.

6
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:32,200
And what we like to pick is ideally first the city and then the service.

7
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:39,600
So in our case it would be Queen Creek Concrete.

8
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,080
And we always like it to end with .com.

9
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:51,280
Search domain, let's see if that's available.

10
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,160
So we don't want to spend that much.

11
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:59,280
And GoDaddy will show you the options that you have.

12
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,000
So let's try to flip it.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:14,080
Let's do Concrete and then QueenCreek.com, see if that's available, see if it's not available.

14
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:23,040
So what we like to do is put the location back and just put a little divider right there,

15
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:29,240
put Concrete, alright, search domains, ok that's available.

16
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,960
So perfect.

17
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,720
We definitely never want to switch to .com, we don't want to do .co, .net, blah blah

18
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,720
blah.

19
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:51,000
So QueenCreek.com, continue to cart, perfect.

20
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,880
We definitely just want to do a year to start off.

21
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:02,920
And then we always like to add the full domain protection, so get it.

22
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:12,800
And then I'm ready to pay.

23
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:22,160
And then complete purchase.

24
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,520
And after we're done purchasing we're going to connect it to our Weebly website, should

25
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,360
be fairly simple.

26
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,560
There you go, perfect.

27
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:45,960
So I am going to continue connecting to an existing site.

28
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:54,000
Ok, and the destination is Weebly, right here.

29
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Connect domain.

30
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,160
Ok, and here is going to give you the steps.

31
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,160
Go to Weebly, click edit next to your site, want to connect, click settings and then click

32
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,240
change under site.

33
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:15,040
So make sure you copy this right here, command copy, go back to Weebly, and what we like

34
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:22,680
to do is click publish just to save it.

35
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,440
So we're going to click save and publish, we like to just do the pro up here.

36
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:33,360
The reason why we publish it, it's because that's how you save websites on Weebly.

37
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,920
So anytime you make an edit, make sure you always click the publish, publish, publish.

38
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,800
Then we're going to click exit, now you can click out of it.

39
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,840
So this is our website that we built.

40
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,280
Click, just click right here, don't click on edit website, just click right here, ok.

41
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,840
Click on these three dots and then edit domain.

42
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,560
You're going to click provide your domain and you're going to paste in the domain that

43
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,840
you just bought.

44
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:17,840
Click save, perfect, and then you're actually going on edit website, ok, domain, click on

45
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,440
settings, we want to change that.

46
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:29,920
So just name it the same as the page title, queen creek concrete, uncheck that, click

47
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:40,800
save, enable SSL, ok, it should tell you that, then click publish again, because again we

48
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:47,000
always want to save everything that we're doing, ok, perfect, and you're done.

49
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:55,280
And just so you know, right now it says not secure, because when we clicked on settings,

50
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,400
it's still doing it.

51
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:02,380
So just make sure you check on it later and it is secure and you're done, that's all you

52
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:02,880
need to do.
