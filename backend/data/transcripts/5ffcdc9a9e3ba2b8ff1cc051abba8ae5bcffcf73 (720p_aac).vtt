00:00.000 --> 00:04.480
the only other objection I got is more like I'm not on the spot kind of guy really that was about it

00:04.480 --> 00:09.200
which that comes back back to like the building urgency right like I don't give a fuck if you're

00:09.200 --> 00:14.640
on the spot guy or not uh I don't care I'm here to find it like like you're not saying this but

00:14.640 --> 00:19.600
you're you're you're you're kind of like exuding this by how you're saying it you're like I don't

00:19.600 --> 00:24.960
give a fuck what you you are aren't we have a call I have a call in an hour you know I do this

00:25.040 --> 00:30.320
exclusively are you in or at shit or get off the pot motherfucker like that's the mentality you have

00:30.320 --> 00:36.080
to have and again also comes back to think in your head going like I'm the one that has what he needs

00:36.080 --> 00:41.360
there's 20 of him there's one of me so I call the shots here and and even though you want that deal

00:41.360 --> 00:45.600
you want that fucking deal so bad you have to make it seem like you don't need that deal right last

00:45.600 --> 00:50.160
question last thing I'm gonna say uh is mostly whenever I'm trying to do create the urgency is

00:50.160 --> 00:55.120
I'll do like next day so a lot of things I hear people say is like in an hour in two hours and

00:55.120 --> 00:59.520
three hours I feel like most of the time like with the last two guys we've had a reschedule

00:59.520 --> 01:03.600
for a two hour because he'll be on a job for 5 p.m and they'll be like dude can we do 7 p.m and

01:03.600 --> 01:08.480
I'll be like sure but I do have a call with the guy in the next two days one day so is it really

01:08.480 --> 01:12.800
better to do it like right then like next three hours or one yeah what I usually say is like I'm

01:12.800 --> 01:18.960
just like hey you know uh I got a call I'm supposed to do a call sometime tomorrow afternoon so I just

01:18.960 --> 01:24.720
want to make sure we're good that way you're not tied down to a time and you can still and I also

01:24.720 --> 01:30.400
like to call that company and just kind of have an open conversation and let hey whatever I'm

01:30.400 --> 01:33.440
you know I'm probably going to be working with someone but would you be interested in taking

01:33.440 --> 01:40.480
leads that way if he happens to know that business owner and he calls him it's not like oh he's lying

01:40.480 --> 01:41.760
yeah I like that perfect
