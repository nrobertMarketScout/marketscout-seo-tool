00:00.000 --> 00:10.240
All right, so here we are buying the tracking number for our website.

00:10.240 --> 00:12.400
We personally use car rail.

00:12.400 --> 00:17.160
You are more than welcome to use Twilio or whatever other software you want to use.

00:17.160 --> 00:18.160
That's fine.

00:18.160 --> 00:21.260
I'm just showing you what we currently use for our company.

00:21.260 --> 00:27.000
So once you make an account, very easy, you just put in your email and password.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.600
You can actually also log in through Google.

00:29.600 --> 00:35.720
So you're going to click on this, my account, and I believe it says E because it's evergreen.

00:35.720 --> 00:39.640
So whatever your company's name will have that letter up here.

00:39.640 --> 00:45.800
And then you're going to click on account settings down here under manage.

00:45.800 --> 00:50.880
Click under all companies and you're going to create a company.

00:50.880 --> 00:58.440
So each tracking number will have its own company and that's because let's say you

00:58.440 --> 01:00.760
need to make a quick website for that same company.

01:00.760 --> 01:05.720
We want everything to be very organized and under the same thing, it's very easy to search

01:05.720 --> 01:07.280
as well.

01:07.280 --> 01:10.560
And so we're going to create company right here.

01:10.560 --> 01:11.560
You put the company name.

01:11.560 --> 01:15.480
I actually made a mistake earlier.

01:15.480 --> 01:18.520
It's called Queen Creek, not Queens Creek.

01:18.520 --> 01:23.440
So let me just edit that up here as well.

01:24.440 --> 01:27.440
Just really quick.

01:43.440 --> 01:44.440
Okay.

01:44.440 --> 01:45.440
Back to CarRail.

01:45.440 --> 01:48.840
So actually taking that out.

01:48.840 --> 01:53.840
So it's just going to be like the website title, city and service time zone.

01:53.840 --> 01:59.440
This will be the same time zone as the location that you're targeting on the website.

01:59.440 --> 02:04.560
In my case, Arizona, you're going to put the primary company phone number.

02:04.560 --> 02:10.400
What that means is where do you want the calls coming to your website directed to?

02:10.400 --> 02:16.240
So it will be probably the client's phone number or the secretary, whoever is scheduling

02:16.240 --> 02:18.000
the leads phone number.

02:18.160 --> 02:26.640
I'm just going to put a random one, okay, add users.

02:26.640 --> 02:31.840
This is where you can actually add different users to be able to check the reporting.

02:31.840 --> 02:36.960
CarRail also allows you to listen to the recording calls.

02:36.960 --> 02:43.040
And then once you add it, you can create an account user that is your client if he does

02:43.040 --> 02:45.240
like to listen to the recordings.

02:45.240 --> 02:47.000
So you can get pretty creative here.

02:47.000 --> 02:53.000
And then you're just going to click on create company and go to company dashboard.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
CarRail will automatically take you here.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
Okay.

02:57.000 --> 03:02.000
So let's select the company that we just created, which is Queen Creek Concrete here.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
Oops.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.160
It's the other one.

03:04.160 --> 03:06.120
We already had one.

03:06.120 --> 03:08.560
We do like to add the state as well.

03:08.560 --> 03:13.880
I just didn't want to create a duplicate, so that's why I didn't put it.

03:13.880 --> 03:17.880
But usually you want to put the state as well, just so you know.

03:17.880 --> 03:24.300
And then you're going to create number, click, I'll use it offline.

03:24.300 --> 03:25.300
Same thing as before.

03:25.300 --> 03:28.480
It should automatically pull whatever number you put earlier.

03:28.480 --> 03:34.000
This is the phone number that the calls will be redirected to, number setup.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.840
So you want to do a specific area code.

03:36.840 --> 03:45.800
And how I picked this, I actually just Google Queen Creek, Arizona concrete, kind of like

03:45.800 --> 03:52.480
if you were doing a due diligence and I like to see what the area codes of the main businesses

03:52.480 --> 03:53.480
are.

03:53.480 --> 03:59.640
It looks like it's a, this one is tricky because they're all different.

03:59.640 --> 04:07.280
Looks like it's either 480, 480 looks like the most common one.

04:07.280 --> 04:15.040
And then what I like to do is just stick that out and put area code because we want to look,

04:15.040 --> 04:22.040
we want the website to look to the customers like we own the company and we're a local

04:22.040 --> 04:23.040
one.

04:23.040 --> 04:24.040
So 480.

04:24.880 --> 04:30.160
So after that, you're just going to go back to Carl, type 480, which is the area code

04:30.160 --> 04:31.160
we want.

04:31.160 --> 04:37.140
Carl is going to show you four options and we like to check each option.

04:37.140 --> 04:44.280
So you're going to copy, search for Google and search for all the numbers and pick the

04:44.280 --> 04:50.880
one that looks the last, the least scammy.

04:50.920 --> 04:56.800
And this is going to be a little tricky, but we like to make sure that we pick a number

04:56.800 --> 04:59.120
that is going to be good for our website.

04:59.120 --> 05:00.120
So search Google.

05:00.120 --> 05:01.120
Okay.

05:01.120 --> 05:07.980
Now we have all four numbers and what I mean with scammy is once you search for all four,

05:07.980 --> 05:17.600
so this one only comes up with few, once we search it, this one looks good.

05:17.600 --> 05:20.920
We definitely, so this one for, this is a good example.

05:20.920 --> 05:23.820
See how this one says escort Phoenix.

05:23.820 --> 05:27.160
We definitely don't want people to think we're associated with that.

05:27.160 --> 05:32.320
So that phone number we're going to scratch off.

05:32.320 --> 05:36.480
Scam alert, definitely not that one.

05:36.480 --> 05:37.480
Some life mates.

05:37.480 --> 05:43.440
Yeah, we probably want to go with this one.

05:43.440 --> 05:48.320
Looks the least complicated.

05:48.320 --> 05:54.720
So the one that ends in 2455 and then again, make sure you do this, especially for the

05:54.720 --> 05:59.200
actual website that is going to be your asset.

05:59.200 --> 06:05.520
And then we are going to name this Queen Creek, just like the company.

06:05.520 --> 06:06.520
Make sure you add the state.

06:06.520 --> 06:10.600
I know I didn't do it for the company, but that's just because we didn't want to duplicate

06:10.680 --> 06:14.240
and you're going to add the service number features.

06:14.240 --> 06:17.280
Make sure you add a whisper message.

06:17.280 --> 06:18.880
The whisper message is up to you.

06:18.880 --> 06:24.440
What the whisper message is when let's say I find the website, I need a concrete driveway.

06:24.440 --> 06:30.600
I call your client will pick up the lead and we'll receive a whisper message before the

06:30.600 --> 06:32.560
lead talks.

06:32.560 --> 06:36.200
So the client knows that that's a lead that came from you.

06:36.200 --> 06:42.200
And so we can put something like new lead from Queen Creek concrete.

06:42.200 --> 06:46.600
So the client knows, okay, this is a lead that Nick sent me or whatever.

06:46.600 --> 06:52.360
And then make sure you click on call recording because we want to record every call that

06:52.360 --> 06:56.440
came through and boom, you're done.

06:56.440 --> 06:57.760
So it's right here.

06:57.760 --> 07:02.520
This is your tracking number that we're going to use for the website.

07:02.520 --> 07:05.900
And then this is the phone number you're going to forward the calls.

07:05.900 --> 07:09.860
If you ever need to change it in the future, just click on this pencil right here.

07:09.860 --> 07:13.020
You click on the pencil again up here and you're going to be able to change who the

07:13.020 --> 07:15.340
numbers are being forwarded to.

07:15.340 --> 07:18.540
You can change the whisper message, you can change everything and then just make sure

07:18.540 --> 07:21.700
you click save and you're done.
