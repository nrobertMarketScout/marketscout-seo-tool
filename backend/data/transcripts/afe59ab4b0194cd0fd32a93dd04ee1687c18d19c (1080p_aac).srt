1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,600
Okay, so now, talking about content, we need to expand our keyword list.

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:15,000
The reason why we do that is because we want to have as many keywords as possible when

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,480
we're writing content, that way we're not using the same keywords over and over.

4
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:25,160
And we want to have an expanded, nice keyword list for each website and each project we're

5
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,240
going into.

6
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,340
So we personally use Basecamp.

7
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:34,420
We don't necessarily recommend it, we got a free account for it, so that's why we're

8
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:35,420
using it.

9
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:40,380
But again, as long as you have, wherever you're keeping your keyword list, just make sure

10
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:45,580
you're making a copy and you're putting this under your website that we're going after.

11
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:49,540
So in my case, it would be Queen Creek, Arizona, Concrete.

12
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,780
And this is the keyword list, okay?

13
00:00:51,780 --> 00:01:00,740
So we usually have about 20 to 30 keywords, and this is the very basic list for Concrete.

14
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:06,860
Now I'm sure this is going to look different than your Concrete list.

15
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:12,940
And again, like we said earlier, when we were building the website, Concrete is a little

16
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,860
broad and a lot of companies will do different things.

17
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:21,300
Some companies do coding, other companies do not do crack repair.

18
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:26,860
So just make sure you're checking in with your client and follow up on what it is they're

19
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,860
doing.

20
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:36,580
Usually the main services are going to be stamped concrete, concrete driveway, and concrete

21
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:37,580
patios.

22
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:41,140
So those are the ones that you want to focus on most of the time.

23
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:46,980
These numbers right here that you see, these are taken from SEMrush.

24
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:51,580
So we use SEMrush, as I said before, you don't need to use it as well.

25
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,780
It's just what we are using.

26
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,300
You can use whatever you want.

27
00:01:54,300 --> 00:02:02,660
And so what we do is we actually plug in each keyword that we have and we see what the volume

28
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:08,260
in search is just to get an idea on, okay, maybe stamp concrete is super important to

29
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:10,060
put in our content, right?

30
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:14,260
Because it seems like it's the most search out of all of them.

31
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,620
And then concrete driveway, it's pretty well searched.

32
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,780
Concrete patios as well.

33
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:20,940
So that's why we do that, just to kind of get an idea.

34
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,140
So go ahead and plug that in.

35
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:28,060
And then after you have your basic one, make sure you also put your location.

36
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:32,900
So concrete companies in blah, blah, blah, New York, Queen Creek, wherever you are trying

37
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,380
to rank.

38
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,380
Okay.

39
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:43,780
After that, you are going to pick, in our case, our homepage was like concrete contractors,

40
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:44,780
concrete company.

41
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:51,780
So I already went ahead and expanded the concrete contractor keyword.

42
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:58,460
So what I usually do is I actually highlight the, I would say between five to eight keywords

43
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:01,660
that I'm going to expand on, okay?

44
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:06,940
So this is usually a short tail keyword, which means it's short tail.

45
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,940
Like I said, very short.

46
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:12,420
And then there's a long tail keywords and they're both important when it comes down

47
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,420
to ranking.

48
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,420
They're just different.

49
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:19,540
So a long tail keyword would be like in a full, like a lengthy one.

50
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:23,740
For example, how much does roof repair cost?

51
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,380
That's a long tail keyword.

52
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:36,580
And so that's why we like to expand them because we want to try, the whole purpose is to write

53
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:40,540
a content that includes things that people are searching for.

54
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:46,100
And people that need a concrete driveway, most of the time will not just type in Google

55
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,300
concrete driveway.

56
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:54,540
They're going to type something like concrete driveway pricing near me.

57
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,860
And that is a long tail keyword.

58
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:00,980
So that's what most people are searching for, especially if people are like on their phone

59
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:04,580
talking to Siri or anything, they tend to be more lengthy.

60
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:10,660
So that's why it's important to include short tail keywords and long tail keywords because

61
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:16,780
most of the time people are typing something more lengthy when they're looking for a service.

62
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:21,700
And so I'm just going to highlight the keywords that I am going to expand.

63
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,700
So we already did concrete contractor.

64
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,660
I'm going to show you another one.

65
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:33,220
Let's do concrete driveway.

66
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:39,260
And usually you want to probably put this in order of importance.

67
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:52,340
So I would probably put this concrete driveway up here since it's something that I want.

68
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,340
Oops.

69
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,900
Okay, there you go.

70
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,340
And now let's expand concrete driveway.

71
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:17,460
All right, so now enter and tab, okay.

72
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,020
So how do how we do this?

73
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:23,380
Once you kind of get the hang of it, you're going to do the same things like you're going

74
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:28,020
to know that an extension to the concrete driveway concrete patio is going to be like

75
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,380
near me cost residential.

76
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:34,580
Like some of some of the extensions are always the same.

77
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:35,900
So they're reoccurring.

78
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:36,900
So you'll know.

79
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,980
But one thing that it's really easy and I really like to do is just get into the Google

80
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:52,020
search down here and just type concrete driveway and it's really nice because Google will tell

81
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:57,900
you will give you ideas, will give you suggestions on where people are searching.

82
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:02,540
And I like to put a space and then just start with the first letter of the alphabet.

83
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,540
So I put a.

84
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:08,700
Okay, we don't care for apron alternatives edition and patio.

85
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:16,540
Okay, average cost could be something and think, think as if you were someone looking

86
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,140
for this service.

87
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:22,380
So think of, okay, I bought a house, I need a concrete driveway.

88
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:27,900
What would I search if I had a buying intent on Google?

89
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:32,540
Okay, average cost seems like someone who is looking to buy.

90
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:37,100
Okay, nothing else really came to my head more than that.

91
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:45,940
So let's start with B base border breaking up room finish base preparation.

92
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:51,980
And again, I would rather put a lot of options there and then you can, it's always faster

93
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:56,300
to edit and cancel things out other than adding them on later.

94
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:00,340
So I'm not sure if base preparation, it's more of a DIY things that someone would do

95
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:06,420
on his own, but we can put that in there and then we'll, we'll do a little more research.

96
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:22,980
see cost contractors cost per square foot crack repair.

97
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:29,100
I'm sure there's company and these are kind of already knowing because I've done this

98
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:33,660
before and companies near me contractors near me.

99
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:38,100
And again, concrete driveway contractors and concrete driving contractors near me.

100
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,140
They are technically two different long tail keywords.

101
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:43,220
One is more expensive than the other.

102
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:47,140
See coding, crack filler and cost calculator.

103
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:50,540
Cost calculator is a really good one because that really means that someone is wanting

104
00:07:50,540 --> 00:08:01,460
a quote mostly I'm already forgetting crack filler and coding.

105
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:12,540
Okay, then I put a D designs could be one.

106
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:17,740
We definitely do not want to put anything that it's DIY other than the only way you

107
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:23,020
can talk about DIY stuff is if you're saying we do not recommend doing DIY because you

108
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:27,700
can cause more damage and it's going to end up costing more.

109
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:34,540
So you could put designs because especially if the contractor is offering stamped concrete,

110
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:39,180
that may be a good way to kind of showcase the stamped concrete and the kind of design

111
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:44,340
they can do on the driveway.

112
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:56,060
Entrance again, think as a buyer, think of you really need or if you can come up with

113
00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:00,740
ideas, ask, ask a friend, ask a family member, say, hey, if you were looking to get a driveway,

114
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,460
what would you search on Google?

115
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:11,380
What would you, you know, and get ideas that way finishes.

116
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:29,940
You probably want to stick away from financing.

117
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,700
We're probably okay doing whole repair again.

118
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,020
Those are like uncertain.

119
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:38,660
You can even highlight in like a yellow or a green to make sure that you do check in

120
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:49,700
with the owner of the company if they do actually do coating or, or repair.

121
00:09:49,700 --> 00:10:00,500
Installation installers near me, installation cost.

122
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,020
You can even throw like concrete driveway.

123
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,700
You can put Queen Creek in my case.

124
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:17,060
You can put like your location, your state, I think I'm missing installation cost.

125
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:42,620
Leveling, lifting again, you're really wanting to make sure that the company that you're

126
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:45,900
working for does this.

127
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:58,220
We definitely want to put them in there and then just highlight them.

128
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,220
You could put makeover.

129
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:02,180
Seems like someone who's doing maybe a new installation.

130
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:26,100
Near me, options, overlay.

131
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:29,620
Okay, I think I already put near me.

132
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,380
Nope, I did not.

133
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:31,700
Okay.

134
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:36,820
Options near me is always going to be one of the options for most keywords.

135
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:49,460
Options near me, overlay, overlay cost on a slope.

136
00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:02,660
Pavers, price per square foot, paving.

137
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:20,900
The reason why we're putting so many extensions is because when people are searching on Google

138
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:28,100
something, Google takes people to certain websites because they are trying to match

139
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:37,460
the intent of what that person is searching to the best results that make answer that question.

140
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:38,340
If that makes sense.

141
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:42,820
So the reason why we want to expand and kind of cover as many questions and there's many

142
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:47,780
options and possibilities because we want to try to gather everyone in the area of Queen Creek.

143
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:55,460
For us, could be New York or Los Angeles, looking for anything, any of these services to us.

144
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:57,780
So not just driveway and patio.

145
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:00,500
We want to gather anyone looking for an installation.

146
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:04,100
Maybe they are looking for stamped concrete, but they're typing installation.

147
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,460
Maybe they're typing makeover.

148
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:11,060
So we want to really gather everyone and that's why we expand the keyword list and we try to

149
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:14,260
anyone that has a buyer intent in that location we want to get.

150
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:18,820
Repair, rest facing, repair near me, replacement.

151
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,380
Repair near me, replacement.

152
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,700
Again, make sure like something like rest facing.

153
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,900
Not everyone does that.

154
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,980
so make sure that your company actually covers that.

155
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:56,580
Sealer sounds, I would put Sealing Near Me. Sealer sounds like someone that is trying to

156
00:13:56,580 --> 00:14:02,980
buy something from those. DIY, Sealing Near Me sounds more like a service that needs to get done.

157
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:10,260
Types, types could be a good option like someone is looking and

158
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:14,180
you know types could go into stamp and here are the options.

159
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,860
Quotes, quotes near me.

160
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,820
I'm forgetting one letter we're on.

161
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:45,860
Queen Creek, if I haven't put that in there, I already put it.

162
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,860
You could put vendors.

163
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:21,220
Okay I think we got most of what we wanted. Okay and that is how you expand a keyword list. Now

164
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:27,060
you're going to do that. I would usually do whatever we end up doing, putting in the H1

165
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:33,620
and we'll cover that later when we do on-page SEO. Whatever you want to really cover as a service

166
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:39,460
page. So remember when we built a website we had a home page. Service page was concrete driveway,

167
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:44,100
concrete patio, stamped concrete. So I really want to expand concrete driveway.

168
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:49,940
My next one would probably be stamped concrete right here and the other one concrete patio.

169
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:57,860
And then I would probably do also concrete company and that's it. So I'm going to highlight these so

170
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:02,900
you can see them. I would do concrete contractor, concrete driveway, concrete company. These are

171
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:08,260
the ones that I would expand stamped concrete and again it's just based on what your services

172
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:14,420
are going to focus. Anything that is going to need like content for you, you want to expand.

173
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:22,260
And that will make writing content a lot easier because once you write content on this page you're

174
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:32,980
going to have all of these options to write about. And that is it.
