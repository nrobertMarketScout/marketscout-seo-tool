1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,320
Like should you, should you not go into it because do you see a lead generator?

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:04,320
Is that what you're asking?

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:05,320
Yeah, exactly.

4
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:13,920
Because is there, is there at one point, uh, too many or too much competition?

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,160
So here's my theory is like, if, if everything checks out, right.

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:24,880
And I do the due diligence from what we talked about in module one and even with the lead

7
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:31,560
generators site or their, their organic site and their GMB, I do that sheet and it's still

8
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,560
open.

9
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,060
There's still opportunity to rank.

10
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:39,840
I could care less if you're a lead generator, if you're yellow pages, if you're Joe Schmo

11
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,040
down the corner, I don't care.

12
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:48,880
For me personally, I've gotten multiple deals where I've noticed one to two lead generators

13
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,880
sites.

14
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,560
Not only do I see their sites, but they're ranking on page one.

15
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,080
I still go into that niche.

16
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,320
I still build the site.

17
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,640
I still land a client that I've had for over two years.

18
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,240
I can think of two examples of done that.

19
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:08,560
So now, you know, if, if, if, if the lead generators are the only ones running ads,

20
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:15,320
that tells me that clearly there's a market because somebody's buying those beats.

21
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,320
Yeah.

22
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,320
Yeah.

23
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:22,720
It looks like it's going to be like a head on competition.

24
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,400
Yeah.

25
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,840
Well, that's the thing is go back to go back to module one though.

26
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,840
It does.

27
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,200
Does it still check the box?

28
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,200
Are those sites really?

29
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,200
Do they have good?

30
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,160
Do they have good backlinks?

31
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,160
Are they ranked?

32
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,160
No, no, no.

33
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:42,160
So like the backlinks are not there like the other people in the maps on page one as well.

34
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,360
No, then go for it.

35
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,360
Go for it.

36
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,360
Who gives a shit what they are.

37
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,360
I don't care.

38
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,360
I do not care who you are.

39
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,960
If, if that due diligence part checks out, I'm in.
