Nick, have you tried the painting niche you painted out?

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:02,560
Never done it.

3
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:08,240
Um, don't love it just because it's kind of like drywall, just some of those

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,960
construction niches where like the, the builders, they have their guy, they have

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,280
their crew and everything else is those bullshit little jobs.

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:15,880
I don't love it.

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,320
I think you could squeeze a deal out of it.

8
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,560
It's not a niche I'm going vertical with though, but good question.
