00:00.000 --> 00:02.080
You let the business owner know.

00:02.080 --> 00:04.400
Say, Mr. Business Owner, I have a, you know,

00:04.400 --> 00:05.560
I got this, when you call it,

00:05.560 --> 00:06.760
when I'm gonna get it in a second,

00:06.760 --> 00:08.120
you're gonna let them know you have a lead.

00:08.120 --> 00:09.160
You're gonna let the business owner,

00:09.160 --> 00:11.440
hey, for these first couple of leads,

00:11.440 --> 00:13.920
I'm actually gonna do a live transfer.

00:13.920 --> 00:16.200
I am going to have the lead on the phone.

00:16.200 --> 00:18.640
So Mr. Business Owner, Mr. Business Owner,

00:18.640 --> 00:21.440
you got my number, save it in your phone

00:21.440 --> 00:25.240
and make sure to save it all caps, answer phone.

00:25.240 --> 00:27.560
This is a hot lead, okay?

00:27.560 --> 00:29.600
I need you to answer this call because it's gonna be money.

00:30.160 --> 00:32.520
We're talking about money, it's a digital goal.

00:32.520 --> 00:33.680
So make sure to answer this call

00:33.680 --> 00:35.360
and I'm gonna be calling you back shortly.

00:35.360 --> 00:36.920
Okay, you hang up the phone.

00:36.920 --> 00:37.760
Now what do you do?

00:37.760 --> 00:39.800
You call the lead back.

00:39.800 --> 00:41.360
Hey, Janet, just wanted to let you know

00:41.360 --> 00:42.760
I've got the business owner.

00:42.760 --> 00:43.600
He's gonna be available.

00:43.600 --> 00:45.400
So I'm actually just gonna do a three-way call

00:45.400 --> 00:46.560
and get you guys patched in together.

00:46.560 --> 00:47.600
He's driving.

00:47.600 --> 00:48.440
Hang on one second.

00:48.440 --> 00:52.120
It's gonna go quiet, boom, patch him in, boom, okay?

00:52.120 --> 00:53.720
That's how you're gonna do it for the first

00:53.720 --> 00:55.400
and you're gonna rinse and repeat, rinse and repeat.

00:55.400 --> 00:56.600
Now, some of you guys go,

00:56.600 --> 00:58.760
oh, do you live transfer every single lead for,

00:58.760 --> 01:01.160
no, okay, I used to.

01:01.160 --> 01:03.800
I used to, I thought it was this great upsell

01:03.800 --> 01:06.120
and I used to say, hey, I'm charging you a premium.

01:06.120 --> 01:09.840
Guys, the logistical nightmare

01:09.840 --> 01:14.840
of live transferring every lead is very, very tough, okay?

01:14.960 --> 01:18.080
You'll never, once you get past a couple handful of clients,

01:18.080 --> 01:19.200
you're never gonna be able to do it all

01:19.200 --> 01:20.960
and you're gonna have to have multiple staff on board

01:20.960 --> 01:23.000
and then it's this whole thing.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
So I only do this live transfer

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
during the initial couple of calls, okay?
