1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,840
Beautiful. Okay, so I see Doug, Shane Noble, Jahill, Stephanie's iPhone, Kurt, Steven Westover,

2
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:17,320
Discord users, always Discord user, Frank, Shane, and then me and you. Okay, beautiful.

3
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:24,320
Let's see, Isaac, sorry, Aaron, would you just keep an eye on the people that join?

4
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:33,440
Absolutely. Okay, awesome. Okay, so real quick guys, welcome to the call first and foremost. Secondly,

5
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:39,680
if you guys, there are a few people in here that I recognize that are inside of our program,

6
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,840
which is cool, and I'm going to just mention this really quick because there are a couple.

7
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:52,800
One of the biggest questions that people have had recently, it seems like for the past six months,

8
00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:03,200
is what is the minimum search volume for a keyword plus city that would indicate that this city,

9
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:08,000
you can go into the city? What's the bare minimum search volume? That's a very frequently asked

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,040
question. Would you not agree with that, Aaron? Definitely. And we've purposely, when we first

11
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:22,400
started talking about this stuff, when we first started our program back in 2021, I was using,

12
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,960
I had been using SEMrush or SEMrush for years. And so I was like, okay, this is what I use,

13
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:34,480
whatever. But the problem with that is that that tool is all over the place, right? And

14
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:41,920
let's just be honest, every single tool is. And so basically what we said and we've been saying,

15
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,120
and I still stand by it, is that whatever tool you want to use, whether it's Google Keyword

16
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:50,400
Plan or Mangools, SEMrush, blah, blah, blah, blah, whatever you want to use, you need to just find a

17
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:55,920
baseline for what is a, you know, you take a website, for example, that's ranking.

18
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,720
Let's say I have Bentonville Concrete. I always use that example because I know exactly how many

19
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:07,440
leads I get every month. It's ranking for GMB. It's ranking for organic for the major seven

20
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:12,320
keywords, basically. And I know how many leads I get. And then I look at what the tool says.

21
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:17,040
And based on that, I can set kind of like a baseline. So that's going to be our advice.

22
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,600
That's what I've been saying. So I've been using. And the reason why we haven't said,

23
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:26,960
hey, this is the tool that says this, et cetera, is because we haven't really wanted to

24
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,800
basically endorse any tool. But anyway, all I'm saying now is that we have been working on

25
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,560
something for like, I think it's been about 15, 16 months where we're pulling data directly from

26
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:44,160
Google to show that search volume. That's one of the functions it does. It also does like the due

27
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,240
diligence in, what is it, like three seconds, Aaron? Two and a half, baby.

28
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,840
Yeah, it's ridiculous. So I used to spend 30 to 45 minutes on a due diligence. Now you literally

29
00:02:53,840 --> 00:03:01,120
put in the keywords. It's honestly three seconds. So by the way, I'm going to take care of that one

30
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:07,360
that just tried to join. Oh, sorry. I think I, okay, cool. Okay. Anyway, guys, for those of you

31
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,320
that weren't on my, if you are in digital landlords, you have no idea what I'm talking

32
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:15,440
about most likely. If you guys are curious about what that is, we are doing the beta test for that.

33
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:20,560
We've had some really good feedback so far. I've been playing around a lot with the tool.

34
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,760
So DM, just DM me actually privately, because I'll send you the information on that,

35
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:31,280
because I'm going to send you a recording that we did. But that is the beta. It is a paid beta,

36
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,640
but there's a discount on it. So anyway, just wanted to mention that really quick as we get

37
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,920
into it. And with that said, I think let's get into the call. Happy freaking Monday.

38
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:49,600
Here's what I want to do in the chat really quick. In the next, let's just say the next six weeks,

39
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:57,760
okay, the next six weeks. So from mid October to the 1st of December, how, and I want everyone to

40
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:05,440
respond on this guys. How much revenue top line are you guys going to add to your business? Now,

41
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:10,800
I'm not talking about your goal, but I'm talking about, I always call this your die goal or your

42
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:18,160
junkie goal, which is if you don't, you're going to hit this number or like I'm flinging myself off

43
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,800
of a bridge type of thing, which is a little bit much, but I'm just trying to paint the picture

44
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,880
here. Like that is the goal that I'm hitting no matter what, no matter what. How much are you guys

45
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:32,160
going to add each one of you guys? Yeah, not your goal, but your actual, like I am going to do this.

46
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,400
Kurt's going for 10k. I love that. Who else? Who else in six weeks? You got six weeks to do it.

47
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,880
Who else is going to do 20? Oh, okay. I thought I said 25. I was like, dude,

48
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:49,920
Jahill's going in dude. He's got the, he's sipping the coffee this morning. 2k. I want everyone to

49
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:54,560
give me a, he's laughing. I want everyone to give me a 500k. There we go. No big deal.

50
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:01,600
Everybody tell me, I want to know Shane Noble, 2,500 bucks. That's two deals. Could be one deal.

51
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:08,560
Steph, Stephen, sorry, 2,500. Doug, 2k. Who we missing? I want to know what Stephanie says. Stephanie,

52
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,200
we've missed a couple people. I think her audio is still connecting. Yeah. Okay. No problem. Shane,

53
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:22,160
I'm new. Currently saving for digital landlords. Okay. Beautiful. Shane, by the way, shoot me a

54
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:29,120
message after. Might have something interesting for you because we're a created bunch over here

55
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:35,520
and it sucks to be sitting there waiting. So shoot me a message after Shane. So guys, 10k,

56
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:44,080
2k, 25. By the way, Kurt is in China. Is that correct? Am I right on that, Kurt?

57
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,960
That's beautiful. So he's going to sling 10k from China. That's the power of the internet, baby.

58
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:56,400
Guys, my agency, I don't really spend a ton of time in it personally. I've kind of advised

59
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:02,160
Francesca, but we're going to do the same thing. We're going to go and add another 10k in the next

60
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,040
six weeks. And I'm going to try something that's going to be slightly different than I've done in

61
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:14,480
the past. I've had a few different months and little sprints where we've done 10k added revenue

62
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,760
and there's no better feeling. What I would recommend you guys doing is setting a goal

63
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:23,520
from now until the 1st of December. And if you hit it, you're going to treat yourself to something,

64
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,800
not anything crazy, but just have that goal. Get excited. I know that this time of year,

65
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,920
a lot of people take their foot off the gas. A lot of people are like, I'm prepping for the

66
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:40,240
holidays. I got Thanksgiving, whatever. And that's exactly why you should have your foot on the gas

67
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,520
because that means that less people are going to be calling these business owners, right?

68
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:49,280
It means that for me, when I know that no one else is up doing stuff, I'm more motivated than

69
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:55,920
if I know everyone is. And I promise you that half the people that are doing this right now or more

70
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,960
are going to be taking their foot off the gas and they're going to be saying, oh, it's Christmas.

71
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:04,640
I'm going to start the 1st of the year. So also if you're thinking, oh my gosh, my business owners,

72
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:10,080
they're not going to be hungry. Guess what? The hungry business owners are still doing business.

73
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:15,520
The hungry business owners are still making moves. It's basically going to be this filter for the

74
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,960
people you don't want to work with anyway because we all know those business owners that you call

75
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,280
and they're like, well, I'm not doing anything until like March. That's not someone you want

76
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:30,480
to work with anyway. So anyway, guys, I truly, in fact, let's do this. Aaron, I want you to

77
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:38,240
screenshot every answer that we just got. And I want, when we get to the 1st of December,

78
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,320
whoever hits their goal that they put in here, I want you to message me and remind me. And I've

79
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:50,320
got something for you guys. Okay. And you can hold me to that. You guys can hold me to that. Okay.

80
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,640
All right. Let's do this again, guys. I'm going to talk about five mistakes

81
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:02,160
that cost me literally, I told Aaron in the title of this to say hundreds of thousands of dollars

82
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,960
because when you say millions, it sounds like you're just using that as like some catch

83
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:13,040
whatever. It sounds kind of cliche, but I would definitely say millions. Now that I got you guys

84
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:18,560
on the call, but we wanted to say hundreds of thousands, but I genuinely can trace back

85
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,880
millions of dollars lost off of these five mistakes. Okay. So I'm going to go through

86
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:28,640
these five mistakes and then any questions you guys have on them, I'm going to expand on them a bit.

87
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,920
And then also we're going to have a little bit of time for Q&A. Okay.

88
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:37,120
Okay. Let me just shut my door. Kids are still sleeping. Hold on.

89
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,880
Okay. Everyone can still hear me, right? Give me a thumbs up if we can.

90
00:08:53,680 --> 00:09:00,640
Yeah. Beautiful. Okay. Guys, I hope you guys are pumped about digital real estate. I know sometimes

91
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,600
when you get in the game for a while, I see some names I've seen for a long time.

92
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,280
You know, sometimes you get in that you go from honeymoon stage, like some of you guys are new

93
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:14,720
to this and the honeymoon stage is so exciting. You know, it's new, it's fresh. The idea of you

94
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:22,000
being able to make money while you're golfing, while you're traveling, while you're doing whatever,

95
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,720
it's exciting and it's fun because it's just the idea and you don't have to do anything. And then

96
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,280
once you get into the actual game, you're like, oh my gosh, this is going to take work. I'm going

97
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:36,480
to have to do X amount of due diligence before I even find my first city. And it becomes kind of

98
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:42,160
heavy and you get kind of weighed down in the minutiae. But I just want you guys to know that

99
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:50,080
I've been weighed down in the minutiae since 2016. And I've had times when I was way more

100
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:55,760
excited about this. I had times when I was way less excited, but I can honestly tell you that

101
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,240
this should tell you that this business model is what it is. And it's the most

102
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:07,120
simplest business model on the internet is I genuinely like last night I was laying in bed

103
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,760
and I was thinking about digital real estate. I know it sounds like I'm making that up or it

104
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:17,440
sounds cheesy, whatever, but I was thinking about adding another $10,000 before December 1st.

105
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,400
I actually want to do that in 30 days, but that's what I was thinking about last night. I've been

106
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:28,480
doing this for eight freaking years. I've made millions of dollars doing this, but the idea that

107
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:34,000
I could just go, Aaron, you can control the mute, right? Yeah. Beautiful. The idea that I can just

108
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,560
go and add $10,000. Now let's call that $10,000. Let's say it's six of net, right? Just because of

109
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:47,040
ads or whatever. And the fact that I can just go add a casual $6,000 to my bottom line per month,

110
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:54,960
what is that? What's six times 12, Aaron? Give us the details. 72. 72. Okay. It's a little early.

111
00:10:54,960 --> 00:11:01,360
Don't ask me that question. If it's a nine, I got you on the multiplication. But so you guys,

112
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:07,120
the fact that you can go and add 70, Kurt said he's going to add $10,000 in six weeks. You can

113
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:15,760
go and add $72,000 to your bottom line just because you decided to. And it's not ongoing,

114
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,360
it's not like one of these businesses like SMMA where it's like, okay, I just got

115
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:25,840
10 new clients. I have 10 times the work. It's like, no, maybe you got 10 new clients and you

116
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:30,720
did a lot of work for 60 days and then the work goes completely down and all you have to do is

117
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,000
maintain it. Anyway, I don't know how you can't get excited about this. I'm pumped about it. I'm

118
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,080
going to do another 10K of added revenue to my agency, not obviously to my program, just to my

119
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:47,920
agency and I'm super pumped about it. So I hope you guys are pumped about it because I'm really

120
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,880
excited about it. Even here, eight years later, coming up on the holidays, I couldn't be more

121
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,440
excited about the holidays because no one else is going to be doing it and I am. Okay. So guys,

122
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:03,120
five things that have literally cost me hundreds of thousands of dollars. I would definitely say

123
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,480
millions, but let's go through these really, really quick and then we'll get into some Q&A.

124
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:13,280
Okay. Number one, and these are in no particular order. These are just as I was sitting there and

125
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:17,520
pondering, I'm like genuinely speaking, if I was having a conversation, me and Aaron were on a

126
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:24,000
road trip, we're driving to Phoenix and he's like, Hey, what's cost you the most money?

127
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,280
And I was sitting there and actually not just giving him an answer out of my back pocket,

128
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:32,320
but I was giving him an answer that I truly felt were the things that cost me that money.

129
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:40,720
These are the things I would say. Okay. Number one is not having my due diligence dialed. Okay.

130
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:50,800
Now, what I mean by that is not having my formula of what is a good city and niche combination.

131
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:59,440
Okay. Not having that perfect, not having that dialed that has cost me. I don't even know how

132
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,720
I would calculate how much money that's cost me. Okay. And what happened to me in the beginning,

133
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:10,480
guys, is I was so excited to get going. I was so excited to get started doing this,

134
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,520
just like many of you are that you want to just take a city, you pick a niche,

135
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:17,920
you go, you build whatever. And by the way, keep in mind, I was doing this the slow way

136
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,520
because I didn't know there was another way to do this. And for those of you,

137
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:26,080
if there's anyone on here that doesn't know what I mean by slow way, I'm talking about actually

138
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:33,520
doing rank and rent, building a website, waiting for six months to rank and then going and selling

139
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:37,440
it. So I was doing that. And I didn't even know there was an option that you could go and you

140
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,000
could pre-sell it. You could go and get a deal this week and then build it out and know for sure

141
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
that you have someone that's willing to pay. Okay. I didn't know any of that. And so keep in mind,

142
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,640
I didn't even have a due diligence process that was dialed in. I wasn't confident in it.

143
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:57,040
I was taking this advice from a group that was, I believe, a bit antiquated. And I just started

144
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:04,000
building sites. And the advice that I got, guys, was just keep building sites, build 10, build 20,

145
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,720
just keep building sites. And the justification that these people were giving me was, hey,

146
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:15,840
if you build 10 sites, even if seven of them don't work and only three of them hit, the numbers still

147
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:21,760
work. And it's like, okay, that's cool because these things are so cheap to build. But I don't

148
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:27,360
have six months to wait for each project to see if it's going to work. And I also don't want to pay

149
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:33,040
for hosting for six months on a website in a niche in a city that I'm never going to do. That's a

150
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:40,800
waste of time and money. And so guys, for me, I made the mistake of just going too quick. And it's

151
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:47,440
hard because I'm a big believer of just taking action before you have all the answers. But this

152
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:53,200
piece of it, guys, the due diligence piece is one you don't want to mess up, okay? I'm all about

153
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:58,320
going and taking action, starting the podcast before you have the cover art or before you have

154
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:05,600
the intro, making the cold call before you have the exact script, just taking action. But guys,

155
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:12,720
for you to commit to a six month project at the bare minimum, based on not knowing exactly what

156
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,760
the due diligence needs to look like, what the metrics, what the formula needs to look like,

157
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:24,240
that is financial suicide. And I have done it. And I've done it on both sides, right? I've

158
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,640
done it in the right niche, but not had my city dialed and not known exactly what a city looks

159
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:36,400
like and just being so concerned about population because somebody told me that I should look at

160
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:42,560
population and thinking, okay, I can only work with cities between $300,000 and $700,000 or

161
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:47,680
whatever it was. And having the right niche, but not knowing what a city looks like, not knowing

162
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:53,520
what the competition looks like, not even looking at cost per click or any of those kinds of things

163
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:59,280
and building, building, building, building in the right niche, but the wrong city. And then on the

164
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:05,440
flip side, I've done the opposite where I've, you know, I've gone into the wrong city and niche.

165
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:12,720
And I remember this specific time, guys, we, we had this client in foundation repair. Okay.

166
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:16,960
And we, I don't even know how we necessarily got into it in the very beginning. I think it

167
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:23,680
was kind of an accident and we got this deal in this city and it worked. It was like this

168
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:28,720
miraculous event. It worked. We didn't even know what we were doing. We picked the city,

169
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:34,640
the niche worked only because we had a good business owner and it was very, very not

170
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:40,640
competitive and everything just kind of worked. And we falsely assumed that this was a good niche.

171
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:45,840
Okay. So what did we do? We went, we started just hitting this niche super hard foundation,

172
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:50,000
repair, foundation, repair, foundation, repair. This is the niche. This is the niche, not realizing

173
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,920
we were about to get in the ring with some, some actual behemoths, some big freaking players. So

174
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:01,760
people that were spending big dollars, we're, we're going against companies that were so big,

175
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:06,560
they had their own internet marketing companies within the company. That was a separate entity

176
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:12,800
that just serviced their freaking companies. I mean, it was ridiculous and we got our butts

177
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:19,280
handed to us. We, we built over 50 websites for one, there was one client that was like,

178
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,400
Hey, let's just go hard. We're like, yeah, let's go hard. So we're like, all right,

179
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,160
we'll build 50 websites. We agreed again, another mistake I'm going to get to in a second.

180
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,640
We agreed to a pay per lead deal, which is a huge mistake that we did. And that's actually number two

181
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:35,680
I'm going to get into. And we got our butts handed to us to the point that I thought there was going

182
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:41,200
to be like some serious, I just thought it was going to be a bad deal. Luckily, the guy ended

183
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:47,440
up being cool. We, we didn't, we didn't have any kind of like, you know, guarantees. We were pretty

184
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,520
good on expectations. So it didn't, it wasn't as bad as it thought. We had some really heated

185
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:57,360
conversations, some really pissed. It was just a bad deal. And this was all because I didn't have

186
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:02,480
my due diligence dial. Okay. So the next question people will be asking, well, how do I, what's the

187
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:08,800
right due diligence? How do I pick a city? How do I pick a niche? You got two ways. Okay. What I did

188
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:16,720
is I spent, you know, it took me a good solid four years of trial and error. Now the crazy part is,

189
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:26,400
is I actually have spent about $23,000 on programs. And, and I, this is by the year of 2020.

190
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:32,720
Okay. I spent $23,000 on programs. That's just rank and rent programs. And I still didn't have

191
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,720
the due diligence process dialed in because all the ones that I bought, those people were not in

192
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,440
the game. They were not, you know, like, for example, we just barely gave her a proposal.

193
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:47,920
My agency, Evergreen, on Thursday morning, was it Thursday morning or Friday morning?

194
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:54,480
It was Thursday morning. Thursday morning, we just gave her a proposal. It's, we gave an option

195
00:18:54,480 --> 00:19:03,680
proposal. It was for 7,500 or $10,000 per month. Okay. 75. So either option is going to be a

196
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:08,400
fat chunk added. By the way, I'm not thinking, if you guys think that I'm like sandbagging this,

197
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:14,160
that's not even what I'm thinking about in terms of this extra 10K. That deal to me is dead because

198
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,480
they didn't do it on the call. It was an interesting deal because we had to talk to the marketing

199
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,720
director who doesn't actually have the power to get on the call, to make the decision, but you're

200
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,160
not going to get the owner on that call. So it was kind of one of those weird, bigger companies,

201
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:31,280
but that I'm, that deal's dead to me. So when I say $10,000 additional by December 1st,

202
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:36,880
I'm not even talking about that, but guys, we just did a proposal for 7,500 or $10,000,

203
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:43,520
like four days ago. That's how much I'm in this game, right? I'm doing this every day. I'm looking

204
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:48,480
at new niches. I'm talking, I'm voice noting Francesca constantly all day. What about this?

205
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:55,360
What about this? And so to keep in mind that I was working with people and I was in programs and

206
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:01,680
groups and none of those people were in the game, right? They did this once or twice or five times.

207
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:06,000
They made 10,000 bucks. They had a good month and made 20,000 bucks. And then they're like,

208
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,680
I'm going to go make a program. And the training was antiquated. It was never solved in the first

209
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:18,800
place because they didn't really have a tried and true system. And I was following these advice and

210
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:23,360
these different due diligence processes. And it got me into a lot of trouble. Okay. So you have

211
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:28,960
two options. You can do what I did, which is kind of like flail around and spend four years and take

212
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:34,960
advice from people that haven't done it or try to figure it out on your own, or you can buy time

213
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,320
and you can go and get the due diligence process from somebody that has done it. And I think you

214
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:43,600
guys know where you can get that. Okay. All right. So number one is not having my due diligence dialed.

215
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:49,360
I always talk about this. I'll keep talking about this. Getting your city and niche dialed is the

216
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:57,040
most important, is the single most important step in the process. Yes, getting the credit card is

217
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:02,720
where it all ends or I guess it's where it begins, but it's where that deal is finalized. But you're

218
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:07,680
never going to get to that point without picking the right city and niche. And even if you do get

219
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:12,880
to that point, and even if you do get the deal, that deal is going to eventually die. If you're

220
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,560
in the wrong city in the niche, in the wrong niche, because you're never going to rank your, your,

221
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:23,600
your leads are going to be expensive. Like it's, this part is so vital and I, I, I can't stress it

222
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:29,760
enough. Okay. All right. Number two, the number two reason, the number two thing that I, number

223
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:35,360
two mistake that I made that cost me hundreds of thousands of dollars was doing pay per lead

224
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:40,640
instead of flat fee. Now I have an entire YouTube video, maybe even two or three YouTube videos on

225
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:47,440
this, but when I started in my mind, I always inherently knew that doing a commission deal was

226
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,160
a bad idea. Right. And by the way, just so we're on the same page, doing a commission deal, meaning

227
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:56,560
I'll send you leads. Let's say Aaron's my tree service guy. I'm going to send Aaron leads.

228
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:03,280
He's going to pay me nothing except for a percentage of the deals that he closes. Okay. And

229
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,280
usually they want to not only do that, but they want to pay you the net percentage. They want to

230
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,720
say, Oh, I'm not even going to pay you on gross. I'm going to pay you on net. Like they want to

231
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:16,960
have zero skin in the game. And these groups that I was in guys, a lot of people were doing

232
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:23,360
commission deals and you know, they would make some money and I would see that, but in my mind,

233
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,480
it just didn't make sense. I was like, the business owner has no skin in the game.

234
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:33,040
Why would the business owner, if I send them leads, why would they be incentivized to even

235
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:37,040
answer my leads? If they have my lead or they have their lead, they're for sure going to take their

236
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:42,240
lead because they're going to make the full rip on their lead and not on mine. Right. So why would

237
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:48,080
they even do it on top of that? Why would they, why would they be honest? Why like what's in it?

238
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,520
What's in it for them to be honest? And then I'm like, even if they are, I'm going to go and check

239
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:57,040
all this. So I always knew commission was not a good idea, but here's where I made the mistake

240
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:05,440
is I thought that the best, what's the correct term? The best deal structure was the paper lead

241
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:11,840
model. And the reason why is because in my mind, I was like, all right, I'm always the person that

242
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,840
will bet on themselves. I'll always be the one that if you give me the option and say, Hey,

243
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:20,720
I'll give you this guaranteed amount of money, right? Let's say that you're offering me a job

244
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:26,640
or whatever. And you say, Hey, Nick, I'll either give you this guaranteed amount of money or I'll

245
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:32,080
give you a commission based on your performance. I'm always going to take the commission based on

246
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:36,320
performance. I'm always going to take the one that that's betting on myself. And so I took that same

247
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:43,120
logic into this business. But I, what I didn't realize guys is that a paper lead model is never

248
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:47,120
going to be based on your performance. You think it is. And on paper, a paper lead model would be

249
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:53,760
this. Aaron is the tree service owner and Aaron is going to pay me for exactly how many leads I

250
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:59,680
send him. Sounds amazing, right? Because it sounds like, Hey, if I just go and I get my SEO ranked

251
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:04,640
or I get my SEO dialed, I get my website ranked for these extra keywords and I can add another,

252
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,800
you know, another five leads per month at a hundred bucks a rip, that's an extra $500.

253
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:14,240
That's on me. I can make an extra 500 bucks this month, right? It sounds amazing. It sounds like

254
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:20,080
there's no ceiling. It sounds like the holy grail of holy grails. But what you don't think about guys

255
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,920
is that these business owners have limits. These business owners don't all think big. These

256
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:30,880
business owners, when you hit a certain number of leads, they start to freak out. When their bill

257
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:36,400
starts to get to a certain amount of money, they start to freak out. They don't have the ability

258
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:41,520
to expand that quickly. They don't have the mind to think that big. And so what ends up happening

259
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:46,080
is you end up getting to this threshold that you don't even know about. And there will be a month

260
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:51,680
that happens. And, you know, I mean, here's the exact what happened to me is I got, I had this deal

261
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:56,560
and we were doing a hundred dollars per lead. Okay. Business owner was cool. We had this really good

262
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:01,600
arrangement. He was good at closing. And he was, you know, we started and it was like roughly

263
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:06,400
around a thousand bucks, getting about 10 leads per month. And he was cool. And we were doing that

264
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,920
and we're doing that and we're doing that. And then all of a sudden my SEO, like one month,

265
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,960
it just kind of clicked. I wasn't running ads. I wasn't doing any of that, but everything just

266
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:18,160
kind of worked. It was either that or the weather or something happened. But my leads like tripled

267
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:22,960
in a month. And that invoice that I send him every single month for a thousand bucks, I sent him an

268
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:29,920
invoice. It was like three grand. And not only did he not pay it, but he went through and he wanted

269
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:36,560
to know the name, you know, he wanted to double check. Was each lead, you know, were they actually

270
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:42,240
somebody that he could service? Was it exactly in his service area? Did they answer the phone

271
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:47,920
on the first try? Did they go, like when they went to the house, were they, all these things that I

272
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:53,840
couldn't control, right? To the point where he was trying to get me to take leads, billable leads

273
00:25:53,840 --> 00:26:02,240
off of this invoice because he would tell them, hey, I'm backed out, you know, two months on work

274
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,480
and they, he would lose, they wouldn't even want an estimate. And then he would say, well, that's

275
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,880
not, I don't want that lead. I'm like, bro, that's your business. You need to hire more people. You

276
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,520
need to be more efficient. That's not me. And, you know, we kind of came to a middle ground,

277
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:20,640
but it just, I tarnished the relationship. So what you don't realize about paper lead guys,

278
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,200
is there is a threshold for all business owners. And when they hit it,

279
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:31,040
you may not even know just, just for the record. Hold on one second. Okay. You may not even know,

280
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:35,040
but you will, at the end of the month, they will let you know. And it's, it's just a pain.

281
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:40,240
Not only that guys, you have to calculate the, you know, okay, how much is it per lead

282
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:46,160
and how many leads did we send? Go ahead and get 10, 15 clients guys. And you're,

283
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:52,240
you literally have to hire, I had to hire somebody to calculate those. And then they're a human and

284
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,960
then they're making mistakes. So then I went and I had a software guy build me a software from the

285
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:02,800
ground up that every lead, it would scrape the email. It would dump it into a glorified

286
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:08,240
Google sheet. Then it would calculate the cost per lead. And then it would link with QuickBooks

287
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:13,760
and it would send them an invoice. Dude, it was such a pain. And that was with software. Okay.

288
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:19,680
On top of that guys, how do you define a lead? What if it's a good lead, but the business owner

289
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:25,120
doesn't answer? Whose fault is that? Is that your fault? Is that their fault? What if it's somebody

290
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:29,040
that calls in, they're interested today, but then they cancel the appointment before the appointment?

291
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:35,600
Who pays for that? You or them? And there's all these variables. And so what I didn't realize

292
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,840
is all these variables. I also didn't realize that when people didn't close jobs, they would blame me.

293
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:46,160
Okay. And I had one guy, I mean, I've got stories for days, but I have one guy in a North, the

294
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:51,200
Northwest corner of the, of the U S I think it was in Seattle or it was either Seattle or Portland.

295
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:59,120
And this guy, he owed us like 10, 15,000 bucks. And we kept hounding them, hounding them, hounding

296
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:04,720
them. This is for, you know, 150 leads roughly. And which is another mistake that I made of not

297
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:10,080
collecting quicker, quick enough. But basically they called us one day, they had their mother-in-law

298
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:16,560
or something call us. I was like, Hey, the situation happened. The partner got arrested for this.

299
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:21,520
We're closing down the business and filing bankrupts. And sure enough, they did. We took

300
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:25,760
them to, you know, we sent them to collections and everything. We got the notice in the mail

301
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:31,520
that said they, you know, they went bankrupt. These are all things that happen because of

302
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:36,320
paper lead. So that said, guys, the Holy grail of Holy grails, the only way you should be doing

303
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:41,760
business is flat V deals. Don't be doing commission deals. Don't be doing paper lead deals. Don't be

304
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:49,680
doing, you know, a hybrid deal. The only scalable way to do it, predictable way to do it is a flat

305
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:53,760
V deal. Yes, on some of these deals, you're going to take a little bit less money, but you know what?

306
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:58,480
You can get the money. You can charge per week, charge per month, set it and forget it,

307
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,080
set expectations. Hey, Mr. Business Owner, some months are going to be better. Some months are

308
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:08,240
going to be worse. This is the amount. If we can double or triple what you spend as your ROI or as

309
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:12,480
the money that's coming back in, you have a great ROI. We'll keep working together. The only way I

310
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:18,480
was able to scale is when I switched to flat V deals. So do not make the mistake of doing paper

311
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,360
lead. And some of you guys might even be on this call right now going, well, I've got a deal. It's

312
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:26,640
paper lead. That's great. You have one deal. Okay. Go and scale that thing. Go get 30 clients with

313
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,480
the paper lead deal. And you go ahead and let me know how that goes. Cause I've tried it and it's,

314
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:35,600
it's, it's, it's bad. Okay. It's really bad. Okay. That's number two. Number one, not having my due

315
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:40,480
diligence style. Number two, not, sorry, doing paper lead instead of flat feet. Number three,

316
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,440
was obsessing over obscure niches instead of just sticking with the boring ones.

317
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:54,560
I heard this phrase so many times I could just go blue in the face saying it, but the riches are in

318
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:59,680
the niches. The riches are in the niches. The riches are in the niches. And of course, from the

319
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:03,520
people that weren't actually doing the model, they were just selling the program. They were just

320
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,200
selling the tools. They were just selling the hosting, all this different stuff. And the more

321
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:11,120
that I built the blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Like, of course you're telling me the riches are

322
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,480
in the niches because you want me to go build a website in a hundred different niches because

323
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:20,240
a hundred, a hundred hosting plans is great money for you. Okay. I don't make my money selling

324
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:25,440
hosting. I don't sell a white labeled platform. I don't sell done for you services, that kind of

325
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:30,480
stuff. So it benefits me nothing for you guys to go and build a bunch of websites. If anything,

326
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,920
it hurts me because then you guys are going to get discouraged and want to get out of the model.

327
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:41,600
Okay. So guys do not think that you can't make money in boring niches. Yes, there is money in

328
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:48,000
there. There's riches in niches for sure. There's riches in obscure niches, but it's not the only

329
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:54,320
way to make money. Okay. And the more predictable way to make money is to make money in the boring

330
00:30:54,320 --> 00:31:00,080
niches first. And then you can start to, and I would, I would kind of like liken this to just

331
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:04,240
business in general, right? Let's say I want to start a business and I want to get rich,

332
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:09,040
which everybody does. I can have two strains of thought, right? I get two schools of thought.

333
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:15,200
Number one is I can do, there's riches in niches and I can sit there for 10 years trying to find

334
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:20,880
this business. That's just this, this niche business that no one's ever thought of. You know,

335
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:25,760
for example, one of my buddies, he, I don't know, maybe they're going to kill it, but he's like,

336
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:29,840
he hit me up one day and I'm like, what are you up to? He's like, dude, we've got this thing,

337
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:34,400
we're pitching on Shark Tank. I'm like, sick, dude. What is it? And this is one of those like,

338
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:39,120
always starting a new business kind of guy. He's like, it's a fan that you attach the top of a

339
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:47,120
porta potty. And I was like, cool, bro. Like, and again, this probably is a need, whatever,

340
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:53,200
but you got to know the guy to realize it's like, he's, he's spent now, he's, he's older than me.

341
00:31:53,200 --> 00:32:00,080
He's probably spent 15 years now trying to think of the, the obscure niche, the obscure business

342
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:05,120
that's going to make him millions of dollars. And me, I went and I said, okay, what's a business

343
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:10,400
model that's tried and true? Rank and rent. Sounds good. Somebody else figured out, let me buy their

344
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,920
program. Boom, boom, boom. Yeah, I had to figure some stuff out, but that's a tried and true

345
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:19,680
business model. I did it. It didn't start off crazy, but I've now made millions and millions

346
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:24,160
of dollars. And now I have the confidence and I've looked at other opportunities. I see other

347
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:30,320
opportunities within this space even to go and I can go and, and now that I have the money coming

348
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:37,520
in, now that I'm, you know, secure financially, I can go and sit back and take my time and say,

349
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:44,000
huh, I wonder about that. I wonder about that. So my, my advice to anyone with business and,

350
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:50,880
and even, and for sure within this business is don't worry about being so obscure. Do the tried

351
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:56,400
and true until you get to a comfortable spot. Once you get to a spot where your bills are paid,

352
00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:02,080
plus some, plus a lot, now you can sit back and you can start to take some moves that aren't going

353
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:06,640
to kill you, that aren't going to put you, set you back. Okay. So with this business,

354
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:12,800
go into the tried and true, go into the fencing, go into the masonry, go into the, the, the spray

355
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:17,040
foam installation, go into the, go into the stuff that everybody is telling you they're getting deals

356
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:21,840
in. Okay. That I'm telling you, I'm showing you live examples that I'm getting deals in.

357
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:26,880
And then once you get your bills paid, once you get out of the rat race, once you get to a certain

358
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:32,960
level, then you can start to look at, oh, let's try doing the, the yacht rentals or the yacht

359
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,880
charters, whatever, right? Something that's obscure like that. Let's see if this will work

360
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:42,800
with private jet companies, which is, you know, probably going to be an entirely different type.

361
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:48,560
Anyway, I sat and I was so obsessed with richer than the riches, richer than the riches. I started

362
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:54,320
building in every single niche. I spent so much time looking at different ideas. What about this?

363
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:59,200
What about this? Then guys, I had to go in and not only did I, I didn't know if the niche was

364
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,360
going to work because I'd never heard of anyone doing it, but then I also didn't know if the city

365
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:09,840
was going to work. So I had two variables that could kill me. So go into the tried and true,

366
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:14,080
go into the boring, get to your, you know, revenue point where you're comfortable,

367
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:18,720
and then you can worry about that. So the third thing that, that really cost me a lot of money,

368
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:22,560
cost me hundreds of thousands of dollars was obsessing over obscure niches. You don't need

369
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:29,120
to do it. It's, it's, it's not necessary. Okay. Number four, I got two more. I'll go through these

370
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:35,120
in about five minutes and we'll do some Q and A. Number four is not, this is the fourth thing

371
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:40,800
that cost me hundreds of thousands of dollars was not taking people's advice that had been there,

372
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:46,080
done that. And instead taking advice from people who had not been there and done that. Okay. Now

373
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:51,280
the reason I phrase it like that, which is kind of hard to even follow was I would have loved to

374
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:55,040
take someone's advice that had been there, done that. I would have loved to take someone's advice

375
00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:01,280
that had made a hundred thousand dollars per month or had made $50,000 per month, or for heaven's

376
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:07,440
sake that had made $35,000 per month. But the person that I knew that had made the most amount

377
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:12,160
of money doing this, that the most they had made in a single month was like 20,000, 25,000 bucks.

378
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:16,320
And they weren't even in the game anymore. So it wasn't even credible. So I couldn't go to that

379
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,600
person and say, Hey, what do you think about this? What do you think about this update? What do you

380
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:23,440
think about this thing that Google's doing? What do you think about this? I couldn't, you know,

381
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:30,160
I did. And they were giving me their advice, but the advice was not correct or it wasn't up to date.

382
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:35,440
Okay. And some of you guys, I'm not pointing fingers and hopefully not all of you guys,

383
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:40,800
but I know some of you guys are taking advice from anyone and everyone. And that's the problem.

384
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:45,600
And I see this in the free group and I try to kill it as soon as possible, but I see all the time,

385
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:53,200
like, Hey, I got this landing page that it converts like crazy. DM me if you want it. First of all,

386
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:58,720
they're soliciting. I kick them out immediately. Second of all, I want to be like, Hey, before

387
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:02,880
you're allowed to post something like that, I want to see your Stripe account. I want to see,

388
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:06,320
you know, how much money you've made. I want to see your contracts. I want to see how long you've

389
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:10,960
been doing this. I want to see if you actually know what you're talking about. Okay. So guys,

390
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,800
you have to be, there's so much free information out there. There's so many people talking about

391
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:23,440
this. I know a couple of guys that live in the same city as me. Okay. These guys have never even

392
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:30,240
done rank and rent. And I know like, dude, they, I know this because they told me. They told me,

393
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:34,640
they bought a rank and rent program. They're like, yeah, we did use some of the SEO tactics

394
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:39,200
for our business. They were doing some solar sales. They're like solar bros. And then they

395
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:44,480
just decided to start a program and they're out there hawking a program for like 5,000 bucks.

396
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:49,840
And they've never even done it. So the question you guys need to ask every single time you're

397
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:56,320
going to take advice is, you know, what have you done in this business model exactly like this?

398
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:00,960
Not, not what have you made selling the course? Not what have you made selling a tool? Not what

399
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:07,680
have you made on social media? How much have you made doing rank and rent? Okay. That like period.

400
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:11,920
How much are you making now? Are you still in the game or did you check yourself out? Okay.

401
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:17,600
I can't stress this enough. It's whenever we use these examples of like the gym, the gym analogy,

402
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:23,520
like, of course, if you wanted to get, you know, in, in crazy good shape and get a six pack and

403
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:29,680
look chiseled, you know, you wouldn't go to somebody who doesn't, right? To put it nicely,

404
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:34,320
you wouldn't go. But, and that's obvious, right? Of course, when you're getting, you know, you're

405
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:38,480
going to go to somebody to, to manage your money, you wouldn't go to somebody that's completely

406
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:43,600
broke, right? And those things make sense to us. But for some reason, when it comes to this,

407
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:48,560
we don't even think about that. I'm not taking advice. There was this, there was this clip I

408
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:54,640
put on my Instagram. If you guys aren't following me there, I post a lot of rank and rent stuff.

409
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:59,760
You can follow me. It's at digital drug dealing is the handle. But I put this clip. It was Kanye

410
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:06,320
and Piers. Piers Morgan, I think is his name. And Kanye is like, Piers, how much money are you worth

411
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:10,320
or how much money do you make? And Piers is like, well, not as much as you. And Kanye is like,

412
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:15,920
well, then why should I listen to you? And it was like, he was, it was being an ass, but it was

413
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,600
funny. And it was really true because he's like, it's the truth. And Kanye is like, well, you

414
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:23,920
should listen to me about money and maybe make more money, right? So whoever you're going to take

415
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:30,720
advice from, that's your business. Just ask them. And even though I knew that inherently, and by the

416
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,160
way, just because they're making a little bit more than you, doesn't mean you should necessarily

417
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:39,440
follow what they're doing. Look at where you want to end up and don't take advice from anyone,

418
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:44,080
except for the people that are there. If you're looking to make at least $100,000 per month,

419
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:47,840
then you're going to have a very select group of people you're going to take advice from. Because

420
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:52,880
to get to 25K is a completely different thing than getting to 100K. And you're going to build

421
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:57,040
your business differently. You're going to scale differently. You're going to do all kinds of

422
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:01,280
different stuff differently. And in order to get 25K, the same thing that gets you to 25K is not

423
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:05,360
going to get you to 100K. So look at where you want to go eventually, where you want to end up,

424
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:10,720
and only take advice from people that are there. Okay? Here's my last thing that cost me. And this

425
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:15,920
was probably, if I were to give priority to any of them, if I were to say this is the most important

426
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,520
one, this is going to be the most, you guys are going to think I'm just saying this to be catchy,

427
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:25,360
but this is the advice that I heard. And it changed everything for me. It was at the perfect time.

428
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:31,520
And it was just great advice. And that is the thing that cost me so much money

429
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:38,640
was me being too smart. Okay? Me being too smart. Now, let me explain that. That doesn't mean that

430
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:42,960
I have like a super high IQ and it's like, oh my gosh, I can't believe my parents gave me such good

431
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:50,160
genes. No, I've never been accused. I've never been accused of being super too smart. Okay?

432
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:55,600
What I mean by that is being too smart. And I knew that this was working. I knew that something

433
00:39:55,600 --> 00:40:03,760
was working and I was too smart to just do it again. Right? Instead of just being simple

434
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:09,120
and basic and saying, hey, this worked, let me just do it again and again and again and again.

435
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:16,160
I got too smart. I thought, well, you know what? Let me try and do, you know, it worked. That worked.

436
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:21,760
But why, you know, let me do this. Or, you know, I got a deal for $700 per month, my very first

437
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:29,280
deal. And it was a flat fee deal, actually. The irony is that my very first deal, guys, was a

438
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:33,440
flat fee deal. It was in the wrong niche. It was in towing. But it was a flat fee deal for 700 bucks

439
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:39,760
a month. And guess what I did on my next deal? A paperly deal. Right? I had the deal. It was working.

440
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:47,440
But let me be too smart. And I started getting too smart. Right? I started saying too much. I

441
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:51,840
started going into too many niches. I started offering too many services. I started thinking,

442
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:56,000
you know, I was too smart. And then I heard this advice. Somebody said to me,

443
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:05,760
if you've gotten a deal for $1,000 a month, why haven't you done that 100 times?

444
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:13,920
And it was such a simple thing that they said. And I was like, yeah, why haven't I? And I have

445
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:19,760
gotten a deal for $1,000 a month. So why don't I just get rid of everything else and just go get

446
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:26,400
100 of those? And that was a very great moment for me because I just like, it clicked. I was like,

447
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:31,120
I'm being too smart. I need to simplify. I need to be more basic. I need to be more simple.

448
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:36,240
I need to be more simple. John Wooden, baby. John Wooden, every single year,

449
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:41,520
he talked about the fundamentals. He would talk about just the basic, basic, basic stuff.

450
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:48,560
And that's because that's what wins basketball games. So in that same realm, a lot of times I

451
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:54,080
see people get a deal or for those of you that are in my program, there's a couple of you guys

452
00:41:54,080 --> 00:42:01,040
that are in my program, the process is there. The recipe is there. The blueprint is there.

453
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:06,960
Don't get too smart. I'm not saying that I'm the most genius in the world, but if it works,

454
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:11,360
then why are we trying to change it? Once you get to your 10K, 15K, 20K,

455
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:17,280
you want to go and try and flip the model on its head like I did? That's cool. But if you know that

456
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,880
something's working, just do it until you get to a comfortable spot and then you can start worrying

457
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:25,120
about it. So let me go through this again, guys. Here's the five things that have cost me hundreds

458
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:29,280
of thousands of dollars, five mistakes. Number one is not having my due diligence dialed in.

459
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:34,640
Number two is doing paper lead instead of flat fee. Number three is obsessing over obscure

460
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:39,440
niches instead of just sticking with the boring ones. Number four is listening to the wrong people

461
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:45,520
and not listening to the people that were at the place I wanted to be. In my defense, I didn't know

462
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:51,680
anyone at that place. You guys do. You know somebody that's made at least $100,000 per month for

463
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:56,560
years. So that's a good start. Okay. And if there's somebody that's made more than me,

464
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:03,840
then go listen to them. Okay. And then number five, guys, is being too smart, not being simple.

465
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:09,360
There is so much power in being simple. There is so much growth that happens in being simple.

466
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:14,960
And that's in every area. I'll share this last example. And then if you guys have Q and I want

467
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,640
you guys to start dropping, I'm going to have Aaron go through it. But guys, this is even true.

468
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:22,080
I kind of went through this period where I simplified everything. I simplified my business.

469
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:29,600
I'm constantly trying to do that, right? And this happened to me with fitness too. In early 2020,

470
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:35,440
sorry, early 2022, I decided, you know what, I'm going to go, no, was it 2022? It was 2023,

471
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:40,640
I'm sorry. I decided, you know, this is going to be the year. I was 31 or 32. I can't remember

472
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:45,360
what it was. I can't remember, whatever. And I was like, I want to be in the best shape of my life.

473
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:50,720
I want to be less than 10% body fat. I want to look like this, whatever. And so I went out and

474
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:57,600
I was like, I'm going to find the person that has the body I want, that's my age, that doesn't do

475
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:02,560
steroids, you know, all the things. I want to make sure that they were as close to me as possible.

476
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:06,400
And I'm going to go and pay them. And I found the person. I went, I asked them how much they charge.

477
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:11,280
I said 20 grand. They don't do this. They said usually, they usually just sell their program,

478
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:16,320
but they'll do the one-on-one coaching. It's 20 grand. And I paid 20 grand for six Zoom calls.

479
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:25,040
Okay. Anyway, long story short, the craziest part about that whole process is that it worked

480
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:31,040
and it worked miraculously. And to this day, I've never been in better shape. And here's what's

481
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:39,600
crazy. The training regimen that he gave me and the diet plan that he gave me and the entire

482
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:44,560
schedule of everything that he gave me was so simple that I didn't believe him.

483
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:51,280
I was working out since I was 18. I'd been working out six days a week doing different muscle groups,

484
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:56,640
two muscles, one muscle, all kinds of different stuff, then doing cardio on the weekends. And

485
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:00,560
he's like, dude, you need to lift three times a week. And on top of that, you're only going to

486
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:05,840
lift five lifts on those three days. And I was like, there's no way I'm going to gain weight.

487
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:11,920
He's like, okay, well then don't change anything. Follow this nutrition and do this. And I promise

488
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:18,080
you guys it worked and it blew my freaking mind. It was like, I've had to put in less effort

489
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:22,640
mentally and honestly physically than I ever have. When I do it, I do it as hard as I can.

490
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:29,040
But it is very, my plan is so simple. I can text it to you like in this. The amount of workouts I

491
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:35,280
do is so simple. I can do it with just a basic garage gym. Okay. That's the power and simplicity.

492
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:41,200
All right, Aaron, do we have any questions? If not, then we don't have to go spending more time.

493
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:47,520
If Aaron, is he still on? Yes. So we have so far one question and this is coming from

494
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:51,200
Kirk, Kirk Dahlstrom. And so he actually just joined a few days ago.

495
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:58,240
Mr. China, Mr. Chinese living in China, which is crazy. Yeah, so cool. I think our first

496
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:03,600
Chinese resident. Anyway, but he this he's obviously a newbie because this is a pretty

497
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:08,160
basic question we can go over found a great city, but I'm finding another R&R site in the city,

498
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:12,560
big volume and low CPC, go for it and move on. So it's the all what I do. Yeah, go ahead and

499
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:17,520
answer Aaron. You know, these here's what's funny about Aaron, guys. If you ever see Aaron post in

500
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:23,760
the group, you can I'm going to put my stamp on it that you can just follow his advice. Now, number

501
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:28,960
one, because he's getting deals, he's got deals. Number two, because he and I talk so much that

502
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:33,600
when he answers a question, it's exactly how I would answer it. Like, he'll he'll be like,

503
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:38,800
Hey, let's do this. I'll give him an idea for live. He'll give me a title. It's almost exactly

504
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:43,200
how we do it. So I already know this answer, Aaron, I'm just gonna have you do it because I

505
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:47,200
know you're gonna get the exact answer. Yeah, so pretty basic answer. Nick talks about it all the

506
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:51,200
time. It's a great question. The bottom line is Kurt is that it doesn't matter how many lead

507
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:55,280
generators are in there. It just always comes down to the numbers, right? And so the more lead

508
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:59,440
generators that are in there, sure, theoretically, the more competitive it will be. But there could

509
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:03,680
be a hundred lead generators in there. The main things that we're looking at is the search volume,

510
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:09,040
the CPC, and then also the and then that's mainly for the ad portion. And then the SEO portion

511
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:13,200
is when we look at the backlinks of the content in the age of the domain, right? Those are the

512
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:17,120
main and obviously, we have criteria for that it's in the program, you know, but those are the main

513
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:22,000
things we look at. So it could be zero could be 100. Don't treat them like they're all local

514
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:27,600
business. Let me this let me do this really quick. I'm going to show you this, Kurt, I'm going to

515
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:32,640
just give you a quick example. I think I can share my screen. Okay, yes. Beautiful. You guys

516
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:38,560
can see my screen, right? Yeah. Okay, this is when my whole my whole world changed on this on this

517
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:45,840
idea is I was looking at this specific city. I love how people are just joining the thing. It's

518
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:52,320
like, dog, you're you're you're a day late, a dollar short here. Okay. Okay, so I live in St.

519
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:56,320
George, Utah. And I was like, you know what, this is when I was trying to simplify whatever.

520
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:04,560
So I searched this, and I started doing my my due diligence. And I saw this website right here.

521
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:09,040
Okay, I think this is it. No, that's not it. Which one did I see? I think it's down further.

522
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:14,960
Where is it? This is hilarious. Okay, it's not even here. That's even better. Okay, so this

523
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:20,960
would be a better example. So I go and do my research. And I see this website, it's like just

524
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:26,640
the basic tree service st george.com. Or no St. George tree service.com. And I was like,

525
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:31,520
you Kurt, I was like, gosh dang, I missed it. It's on my own backyard, and all this stuff. And I

526
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:36,640
went I and I was so ticked about it, because everything looked good. Except for there was

527
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:40,400
another lead generator. I was like, dang it, somebody already came here. So I went I did like

528
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:46,400
the who is I found the name of the person on the website, I looked in my group and sure as sure

529
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:51,040
enough, it was somebody in my group. So I went to my DMs, and I messaged it was a lady. I said,

530
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:55,760
hey, oh, before that, guys, I called the website. And I was like, I made sure and sure enough,

531
00:48:55,760 --> 00:49:00,160
they didn't have a client. So number one, Kurt, don't assume they have a client. Most time,

532
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:04,240
you got to realize people don't know how to sell the lead. Everyone thinks if you get leads,

533
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:07,600
and you build a website, that's the that's the end all be all that's the beginning.

534
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:13,040
The actual skill is selling it. So they didn't have a client. So I reached out and I said, hey,

535
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,320
I'm in your group. I live in St. George. I would love to make an offer on your website. And I'd

536
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:23,280
love to buy it from you. And she gave me like the most snarky, like snubbed response. And

537
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:28,080
it really just kind of frustrated me and pissed me off. And that's what actually caused me like,

538
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:32,080
you know, I let's game on. I didn't care if I lose money. I just want to put you out of business

539
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:39,440
or whatever. I want to put you down of spot. And I went into this space and built this beautiful

540
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:43,840
little website. I mean, this thing is killing it. Look at this. Look at the picture we chose

541
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:50,480
for our background. We built this guy right here. And as you can see, I am number one here. I don't

542
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:57,200
by the way, I don't even have a GMB. And we make 1000 bucks a month have been since 2020. I actually

543
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:03,200
closed this deal on the hood of a car in a Maverick and a gas station parking lots called Maverick

544
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:11,200
in 2020 during COVID and made 1000 bucks a month. And that's like from this no GMB. And I

545
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:18,400
almost didn't go into the city. Okay, so and look, here's the irony. This the company, the website

546
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:26,800
that I almost scared me off, nowhere to be found. They gave up. Okay, so if you look at it, and it's

547
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:31,040
the metrics all make sense. Don't be afraid to go into it even if you see another lead generator.

548
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:38,080
Okay, any other questions there? Yeah, we got a few. So well, yeah, Muneeb says, I mean, we can't

549
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:42,080
listen. I'll let you respond to this. Can you list a couple of metrics to identify the perfect

550
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:47,440
city niche combo? I think I might be overthinking it and crossing out some good ones. Yeah.

551
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:54,960
Yeah, that's, that's a that's a that's not a loaded question. It's just a bit of a complex

552
00:50:54,960 --> 00:51:01,120
question with the time we have. I'm trying to think if made, I would direct you Muneeb,

553
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:06,400
Nick had done a YouTube show last year in 2023 titled making hay with Dre. And you kind of had

554
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:11,120
a live dedicated to each of the seven steps in the process. And so I'd look for those first couple.

555
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:15,600
Yeah, that's a good place to start for sure. Obviously, those are that's like, that's like

556
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:20,080
the secret. So that's like, that's what we teach, right? But if you want some ideas, and for time

557
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:25,520
sake, go and look at the go to the YouTube channel, then go to lives and search it under

558
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:31,120
there. Good call. Keep going. Yeah, for sure. Jaleel says, Where are you? Where are you in your

559
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:35,840
agency? Where you are in your agency is motivation. Thanks for the advice. Where should someone be

560
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:42,800
before they strictly focus on consulting? Consulting as in selling a program?

561
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:49,360
I'm not exactly sure. Maybe it's time about legit consulting. Well, I'll say this. I don't know.

562
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:57,200
Like consulting and like the the actual sense of like paying me for my advice. I don't do that.

563
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:01,840
Like I've I will not I've never actually had anyone pay me where I've gotten on a call and

564
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:06,960
gotten paid. So I just don't believe in trading my time for dollars. So the other option is to

565
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,920
you know, package your information and sell it, which is what I'm doing right now, which is why

566
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:15,840
I have digital landlords. Here's what I'll tell you. I didn't. Sorry, super quick, Jaleel, just

567
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:19,760
clarified consulting with the person you have running the agency. So it sounds like outsourcing

568
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:24,800
to a project manager. Okay, I was about to say if you're talking about doing a program, I made

569
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:30,000
a million dollars two years in a row, and then I started talking about it. So that'd be a good

570
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,520
spot to like start a program, which by the way, I got no beef with because if you have something

571
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:36,960
that's different than what I'm offering, go do it. But just make sure you got the pot to piss in.

572
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:46,320
Or I might wreck your life. I'm just kidding. So for me, I mean, as soon as possible, you want

573
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:52,080
to remove yourself from the business as soon as possible. I was I couldn't let sales go. I was so

574
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:59,440
I loved it so much. And it was a high for me that like I just love getting that deal. And honestly,

575
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:04,560
I was finally able to let go of it when I started digital landlords and I would sell I would bring

576
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:08,240
people into the program and I was like, Oh, I still get my fix, right. And then eventually,

577
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:14,160
like I don't even do our sales for that anymore. But the truth is, as soon as possible, I would

578
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:19,760
make sure you go through and do at least five websites end to end every single piece of the

579
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:24,960
puzzle before you start outsourcing and then slowly start outsourcing all the pieces that make that

580
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:30,000
move the needle the least the content, sorry, the things that caught take the most amount of time

581
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:35,200
that move the needle the least building the website, you know, setting up the on page SEO,

582
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:40,880
whatever the stuff that's very, very, like just a formula, and then moving all the way up to sales

583
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:44,800
and sales was is the thing I would get rid of last but you do it as soon as possible, obviously,

584
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:48,640
then you can go and you can focus on more strategic stuff, you can focus on bigger deals,

585
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:53,520
like right now, the only time I get involved in a deal is if it's a big deal. And so like,

586
00:53:53,520 --> 00:54:00,160
for example, we did a proposal for 7500 or 10,000 per month was our options, we gave them,

587
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:04,880
and I got a little bit involved in that deal, because it's like, okay, that's 100 plus $1,000

588
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:08,000
per year, per year, that actually is gonna, you know, make a little bit of a dent.

589
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:14,320
Yeah, for sure. I mean, yeah, I mean, I suppose most of us have read Rich Dad Poor Dad and

590
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:19,600
Kiyosaki talks about until the business can run without you, you still just have a job, right.

591
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:23,600
And so the goal should be how can the business run without that's at least

592
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:28,080
my long term trajectory. So Shane says, thanks, guys, as always have to hop have an awesome week.

593
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:32,160
Thanks, Shane. It's always great to have you. And then last question, Julian says,

594
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:35,440
what's the best sales book you would advise me to read for R&R and why?

595
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:45,520
Best sales book I would read would be The Psychology of Selling by Tracy.

596
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:51,360
Very simple, very basic, but I've read that book, I don't know, three, four times. That's a really

597
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:55,680
solid book. Don't try to listen to it on audio. You will fall asleep, because the guy has like one

598
00:54:55,680 --> 00:55:00,480
of those like very soothing voices, and it's just like whatever, but that's a really solid book.

599
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:06,800
I read that book every year when I did sales door to door, and I read it again as a lead generator,

600
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:14,320
as a digital real estate investor, Aaron. Guys, we're going to end it here. Again,

601
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:18,480
we're going to end it here. Again, as a reminder, if you guys have not already,

602
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:22,400
this is I'm going to show you guys. I'm so pumped about this. This is the thing I was

603
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:25,840
talking about earlier. It's called Rank and Rent Engine, but make sure to hit me up first,

604
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:31,680
because we're doing a beta before you just go and start paying for it. There's a free thing,

605
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:36,320
but if you want to get like a discounted thing, this is where I'm running my entire agency.

606
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:42,080
Send me a message, and I'll send you some information on this. I'm doing my due diligence.

607
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:47,200
I'm tracking my clients. I'm doing my search volume. Every single piece of it is inside of

608
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:52,640
that. You can buy your tracking numbers, and I'm finally able to say, hey, this is a tool that I

609
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:57,440
can endorse. Super pumped about that. Then who was it that was asking about, I think it was Shane.

610
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:01,920
He already hopped off. Was that Shane Noble? Who hopped off? Shane Noble? Yeah. Okay. There's

611
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:05,840
another Shane on here that was talking about something about, yeah, Shane Coogan. Shane,

612
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:12,880
the other Shane, message me. Let's talk. Cool? Awesome. Okay. Awesome, guys. Appreciate you

613
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:18,160
being on. We'll see you guys in the free group. I might be going live later this week. Until then,

614
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:34,000
happy hunting. Let's go get some deals. See you guys.
