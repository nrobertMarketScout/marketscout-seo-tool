1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
What's the biggest mistake people need to avoid when getting into rank and run?

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:14,400
Uh, I would say launching too many sites at once, um, not being focused on a niche.

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,760
And even if you are focused on a niche, like I would not go out and just build.

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,480
I see people, I'm just going to build 50 sites, right?

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,560
It's like, for what, right?

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,920
Like you're gonna build 50 sites.

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,520
It's like, let's get your skill.

8
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,520
Again, it comes down to selling.

9
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:28,560
You could have 50 sites.

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,800
If you're not selling, you're not making money.

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,000
So there's people that have one site and they're making money off that side.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,160
There's people that have 50 sites and they're not making anything because

13
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,440
all they think about is like, let me just launch a new site, launch a new site.

14
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,960
And I think you brought it up before.

15
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,520
You could be ranking on page one, false could be coming in,

16
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,680
but if you're not selling, you're not making any money.

17
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,520
So I think that's a big, big mistake.
