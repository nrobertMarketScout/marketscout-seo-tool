00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
Okay. Does it matter which tool we use at all? Are some tools superior? No, I don't think so.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,120
I don't think so. I use SEMrush because it's what I was trained on. That's why I use it.

00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:18,960
I don't think you guys have to use SEMrush. Karina, SEMrush numbers are so much lower than

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:25,920
other tools. Why don't we use Keyword Planner for volume and CPC? Yeah, great question. So again,

5
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:36,240
it's based on what does the tool that you're thinking of show for St. George's Block Wall?

6
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:42,400
What does it show for the site that you're looking at doing? Go find a site that's producing at least

7
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:47,920
30 leads a month and look and see what the volume is on your tool and set that as a benchmark.
