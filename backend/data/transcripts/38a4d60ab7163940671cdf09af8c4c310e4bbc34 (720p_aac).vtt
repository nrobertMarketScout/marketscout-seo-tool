if you're, you know, if you're, if you're, you know, you're, you've done your appeals,

00:04.000 --> 00:07.920
like you said, stay on top of the appeals. Like when I was doing it, I mean, every two,

00:07.920 --> 00:12.320
three days I was sending those assholes an appeal. I was appeal, appeal, appeal.

00:12.320 --> 00:16.880
And eventually someone, someone responded to me eventually because I was like, well,

00:16.880 --> 00:21.360
this is ridiculous. And I think in some other people in the past that have had suspensions,

00:21.360 --> 00:26.240
like that's kind of been some of the secret sauce for them is they have just been on top of it.

00:26.320 --> 00:30.160
They're not letting a week or two go by. They go back and find that email and that link and they

00:30.160 --> 00:33.760
click it and they send it. And even though they send you another one, like, yeah, we got you.

00:33.760 --> 00:36.640
You're like, yeah, no, I'm doing that again. And then you do it again. You're like, nope,

00:36.640 --> 00:40.240
I'm doing it again. I'm going to be the squeaky wheel. Here I go. Because like you said,

00:40.240 --> 00:45.120
you're telling them I'm not a scammer. I am a person. I'm not doing this because imagine how

00:45.120 --> 00:49.760
much spam they get every day. Right. And that's, that's a deterrent for them. Because if I'm just

00:49.760 --> 00:54.640
trying to run a hundred thousand accounts and I'm just trying to see what sticks, like I'm not

00:54.640 --> 00:58.640
coming back to that, but if I'm a person running a business, I'm coming back to that. I'm going,

00:58.640 --> 01:02.000
Hey man, what about my business account? What about my business account? And then the finally,

01:02.000 --> 01:06.640
they're like, okay, this person is responding and you might, you hopefully get moved up in

01:06.640 --> 01:10.000
priority to get a response.
