Luke says, I bought the Xpire domain from a roofer who let Xpire.

00:02.480 --> 00:03.360
He rebranded.

00:03.360 --> 00:05.280
I'm thinking of reaching out to them, but it's in California.

00:05.280 --> 00:06.720
You recommend against California and roofing.

00:06.720 --> 00:09.200
So I'm wondering if it's two, just two bad things.

00:10.400 --> 00:11.840
I'm thinking of reaching out.

00:11.840 --> 00:13.200
Yeah, reach out, dude.

00:13.200 --> 00:17.440
I only like, the only reason I say avoid California is there's easier places to make money.

00:18.000 --> 00:22.400
But if you can find a spot that has like, I would go and research that person's city.

00:22.400 --> 00:23.440
How is the competition?

00:23.440 --> 00:26.000
How many leads are there actually flowing through that city?

00:26.000 --> 00:27.440
Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

00:27.440 --> 00:28.000
Okay.

00:28.000 --> 00:28.800
That's what I would do.

00:28.800 --> 00:29.920
And then you can make that decision.

00:29.920 --> 00:31.360
I don't think it's the worst thing ever.

00:31.360 --> 00:35.200
I just think it's not the greatest use of your time if you have another option.

00:35.200 --> 00:35.600
Okay.
