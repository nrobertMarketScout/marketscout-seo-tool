{"text": " I love talking business. I love helping people make money because it helps me make money. Okay. I'm not the philanthropist. I'm not the guy that's going to say I like to help people. I like to help people make money because that's how I make money. So let's just clear that out of the way. But what I want to share with you really quickly to give you a little bit of confidence that you did make the right decision and I do want to thank you and tell you right now that I will make sure that you get far more value than you will ever spend with me. That is my commitment to you because I know how this works. I know that I need to help you get deals. You're here for one reason and that is to make money. You are here to get deals and if I can help you get deals, I'm therefore going to make money. Okay. But I want to give you a little bit of confidence and say this does work and I'm not talking about the case studies, which is social proof. I want to just tell you how this came to be really quickly. This is not something that a couple of months ago I sat down and went, you know what? There's a huge opportunity to make money and I'm going to develop this system and I'm going to sell it. No, what happened was in 2019, as you guys may or may not know, I was $60,000 in debt. I had two cars. I lived in a different house. I had a house payment. I had three kids and I had a really upset wife who didn't even know about that debt. I sat down and I looked at my situation and I looked at my goals and I was like, I want to make $100,000 a month. I can't do this. I can't work for somebody else. I have to own the thing. I have to own the business. I had been doing some version of a digital agency for years and years and years and I couldn't scale. What this is, what you're about to watch, what Flat Fee Mastery is, is it is the product of how I was able to go from a situation that was very dire to doing seven figures in a 12-month period. That is what this is. This is something that came, this was the solution to my problems. This is the solution to how do I scale up and hit the $100,000 per month goal that I had set for myself and that is how this came. I want to make sure that you understand this did not come as a way to make money. This came because I needed to get out of that really terrible situation and I figured out this thing called results in advance and this thing called running ads to a landing page and all these different little pieces of the puzzle and I started testing and I started tweaking and I started refining and I developed this process. I just want you to know that the reason that I can assure you that this works is yeah forget about the case studies, forget about all the people that I've already shown you that have tried this and made this work but this is exactly what I used to get out of my situation that was the catalyst to get me to where I am today. I believe the best products are those that were made as solutions. There were those that were made to solve problems, not the ones that were created, not products that were created just to make money and I'll tell you that this what you're about to jump into, what you're about to see, what you're about to go through was the solution that I came up with to my problems.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 23.28, "text": " I love talking business.
