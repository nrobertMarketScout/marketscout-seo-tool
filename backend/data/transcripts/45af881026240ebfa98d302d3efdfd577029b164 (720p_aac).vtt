00:30.000 --> 00:40.280
Guys, let me know if you can hear me in the chat, please.

00:40.280 --> 00:45.760
I don't see anybody on, but let's go ahead and just wait a second here, see if I'm actually

00:45.760 --> 00:46.760
live.

00:46.760 --> 00:48.680
Okay, we've got one person on.

00:48.680 --> 00:49.680
Maybe that's me.

00:49.680 --> 00:51.880
I'm going to wait a second.

00:51.880 --> 00:53.960
My chat, Facebook's terrible.

00:53.960 --> 00:56.160
I can't even see who's on.

00:56.160 --> 00:58.240
It's awesome.

00:58.240 --> 01:03.160
If you can see me, hear me, please comment below, okay?

01:03.160 --> 01:04.160
In the comments.

01:04.160 --> 01:05.160
I'm going to be quick on this.

01:05.160 --> 01:06.160
I'd like to have a few people on live.

01:06.160 --> 01:09.080
If not, I'll just go anyway, but let's go ahead and see.

01:09.080 --> 01:13.480
I'm going to wait one, two minutes and I'm going to hop on.

01:13.480 --> 01:16.080
Can you hear me?

01:16.080 --> 01:17.080
Let me know in the chat.

01:17.080 --> 01:21.440
If you can, make a comment, make an emoji, do something, but I just want to, just real

01:21.440 --> 01:24.400
quick, I'm going to be five, 10, 15 minutes.

01:24.480 --> 01:30.280
If you're lucky, it's going to be much less than that, okay?

01:30.280 --> 01:32.800
Can you hear me?

01:32.800 --> 01:36.720
Okay, see a few people on.

01:36.720 --> 01:37.720
Beautiful.

01:37.720 --> 01:38.720
All right.

01:38.720 --> 01:41.880
Unfortunately, I can't see your comments come in real time, but I do see some comments

01:41.880 --> 01:42.880
that keep refreshing.

01:42.880 --> 01:44.240
Kevin, what's up, dude?

01:44.240 --> 01:45.800
Nicholas Kudlick, what's up?

01:45.800 --> 01:48.560
Kevin says, what's up, homie Nick?

01:48.560 --> 01:49.560
What's going on?

01:49.560 --> 01:50.560
Laura Shepard can hear me.

01:50.560 --> 01:51.560
Guys, welcome to the call.

01:51.560 --> 01:53.640
This is going to be a quick little live.

01:53.680 --> 01:55.040
I hadn't even planned on doing this.

01:55.040 --> 01:58.760
I had planned on doing something else, but I just want to say something as a follow-up.

01:58.760 --> 02:00.560
Jason Allred, what's up, dude?

02:00.560 --> 02:04.680
Guys, it is, what is today, March 19th.

02:04.680 --> 02:08.800
For me, it's almost 5 p.m., it's 4.48.

02:08.800 --> 02:12.960
We're almost done with quarter one, which is pretty wild, pretty exciting, also scary

02:12.960 --> 02:18.200
if you're not doing anything with your business or your life, but guys, I was thinking about

02:18.200 --> 02:23.240
this the other day and I've been thinking about it and I want you guys to really put

02:23.240 --> 02:28.320
yourself in this frame of thought and then also I'm going to tell you why I'm bringing

02:28.320 --> 02:35.280
this up to you right now, but imagine if the deal structure that you had, imagine if there

02:35.280 --> 02:39.680
was no flat fee, if there was no paper lead, if there was no commission, if there was no

02:39.680 --> 02:42.320
joint venture.

02:42.320 --> 02:49.360
Imagine that the only way you got paid as a marketer, as a lead generator, as somebody

02:49.360 --> 02:53.160
who owns a lead generation agency, imagine if the only way that you got paid was if

02:53.720 --> 02:58.280
and when your customer made money.

02:58.280 --> 03:03.920
Not when they got the lead, not at the first of the month, not on the 15th of the month,

03:03.920 --> 03:12.040
not every week, only when your clients made money.

03:12.040 --> 03:16.640
If that was the case, how differently would you attack it?

03:16.640 --> 03:19.320
How differently would you treat the relationship with your business owner?

03:19.320 --> 03:28.560
How differently would you be in your selection of the people that you choose to work with?

03:28.560 --> 03:30.120
It would be radically different.

03:30.120 --> 03:33.200
For me, if I think about that, it would be radically, radically different.

03:33.200 --> 03:35.400
What would you expect out of your business owner?

03:35.400 --> 03:38.280
Would you tolerate your business owner not answering the phone?

03:38.280 --> 03:41.140
Would you tolerate your business owner or even think about working with somebody that

03:41.140 --> 03:46.920
didn't show up to the Zoom meeting or show up or respond back to a phone call or treated

03:46.960 --> 03:49.960
a customer like, crap, would you do that?

03:49.960 --> 03:53.360
No, because the only way that you would be getting paid is if they made money and so

03:53.360 --> 03:57.480
you would hold them to a certain expectation.

03:57.480 --> 04:01.920
Guys, the reason I'm bringing this up is this is kind of going back to last week's live

04:01.920 --> 04:02.920
that I did.

04:02.920 --> 04:04.480
If you guys didn't see it, go check it out, guys.

04:04.480 --> 04:05.480
Last week I went live.

04:05.480 --> 04:06.840
I can't even remember what I called it.

04:06.840 --> 04:11.920
I think I called it Porter's step-by-step guided 10th, 11,700, whatever it was.

04:11.920 --> 04:15.080
Basically, I just went on a rant about what the heck are you guys doing?

04:15.080 --> 04:16.280
Why is no one making money?

04:16.280 --> 04:17.920
Why is no one doing anything?

04:17.920 --> 04:20.960
And thank goodness from that I saw a bunch of people make posts.

04:20.960 --> 04:22.060
They are doing stuff.

04:22.060 --> 04:23.640
For some reason people just don't want to talk about it.

04:23.640 --> 04:24.640
By the way, thank you.

04:24.640 --> 04:25.640
Shout out to AJ.

04:25.640 --> 04:26.640
Shout out to Gina.

04:26.640 --> 04:27.640
Shout out to Vaughn.

04:27.640 --> 04:28.640
Shout out to Porter.

04:28.640 --> 04:32.560
Shout out to all these people that are actually posting their deals and doing stuff.

04:32.560 --> 04:39.360
The point is, guys, is that basically, well, not basically, going off of that live that

04:39.360 --> 04:46.200
I did, I'm sitting here and I'm not thinking about this as much with my rank and rent clients.

04:46.200 --> 04:48.320
I'm not thinking about this as much as my agency.

04:48.320 --> 04:54.640
But I'm thinking about that with you guys is I'm sitting here going, sometimes I let

04:54.640 --> 04:58.080
you guys come in here and, of course, you guys pay to be here.

04:58.080 --> 04:59.080
Thank you.

04:59.080 --> 05:00.080
I appreciate you putting your trust in me.

05:00.080 --> 05:02.000
I appreciate you giving me your hard-earned cash.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
And I will not disappoint you.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
I will show up.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
I will be here.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
I don't care if I have to miss something.

05:06.000 --> 05:10.440
Tonight I've got to get on an 11 o'clock thing because of the time zone.

05:10.440 --> 05:11.440
I chose to be here.

05:11.440 --> 05:12.600
That's part of the game.

05:12.600 --> 05:16.120
I will deliver.

05:16.120 --> 05:20.240
But then once I let you guys in, I haven't been that good about holding you accountable.

05:20.240 --> 05:23.120
I haven't been that good about sticking it to you guys.

05:23.120 --> 05:25.880
And I think part of the reason is because I'm like, well, they paid and it's really

05:25.880 --> 05:28.080
their decision if they want to make money.

05:28.080 --> 05:30.400
And I'm just tired of that, right?

05:30.400 --> 05:32.000
I'm super, super tired of that.

05:32.000 --> 05:36.580
And I want to start treating you guys as if I don't get paid until you make money.

05:36.580 --> 05:42.040
And maybe I'm going to start charging that once you get in for the first five deals,

05:42.040 --> 05:43.880
I don't know, maybe we'll start restructuring the payment.

05:44.880 --> 05:47.680
You're going to pay the same amount to get in, then you're going to give me a percentage

05:47.680 --> 05:50.840
of the, I don't know, well, I don't know.

05:50.840 --> 05:51.840
Maybe not.

05:51.840 --> 05:52.840
Maybe probably not.

05:52.840 --> 05:53.840
Okay.

05:53.840 --> 05:54.840
But I don't know.

05:54.840 --> 06:02.080
But I'm just, I just want you guys to hear me and hear my enthusiasm and also my frustration

06:02.080 --> 06:08.080
that I'm guys, we're adults.

06:08.080 --> 06:09.080
We're adults.

06:09.080 --> 06:12.320
I've read every one of you that's on here right now, every single person that's commented.

06:12.320 --> 06:13.320
Thank you.

06:13.760 --> 06:14.760
I read your application.

06:14.760 --> 06:16.360
I probably got on your call.

06:16.360 --> 06:20.400
I saw the pain that you were going through, the reason why you're in this group, the reason

06:20.400 --> 06:24.400
why you want to become financially free, the reason why you want to make money renting

06:24.400 --> 06:28.000
out simple websites so you can stop letting your kids down, so you could take care of

06:28.000 --> 06:32.160
your mom, so you can stop having regret and you're not going to wake up one day and have

06:32.160 --> 06:34.480
a bunch of things that you wish you would have done.

06:34.480 --> 06:35.480
You told me all these things.

06:35.480 --> 06:37.000
Oh, I just have to make a change.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.760
I can't be under someone's thumb and I'm tired of the nine to five and blah, blah, blah.

06:40.760 --> 06:42.400
What are you doing about it though?

06:43.360 --> 06:44.360
What are you doing?

06:44.360 --> 06:47.120
I know some of you guys that heard my other live here are like, oh, here he goes again,

06:47.120 --> 06:51.920
but guys, what have you done in the last week and a day?

06:51.920 --> 06:55.160
What have you done in the last eight days since I came on here and tried to blast everyone

06:55.160 --> 06:57.440
and said, what have you guys done?

06:57.440 --> 06:59.640
How many times do you have to be reminded?

06:59.640 --> 07:02.360
If you guys didn't see that, please go watch it.

07:02.360 --> 07:07.880
I'm talking to grown ass adults and I swore I wasn't going to curse, but I'm talking to

07:07.880 --> 07:10.000
grown ass adults here.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.240
You guys aren't kids.

07:11.240 --> 07:12.560
You're not in high school.

07:12.560 --> 07:14.060
You're not forced to be here.

07:14.060 --> 07:16.120
You guys paid to be in this group.

07:16.120 --> 07:17.600
You guys forget that?

07:17.600 --> 07:22.600
You paid me money to be in this group and now you're not doing shit with it.

07:22.600 --> 07:23.920
What have you done?

07:23.920 --> 07:25.200
What have you done in the last week?

07:25.200 --> 07:26.200
I want to know.

07:26.200 --> 07:27.640
I want to know somebody that's brave enough.

07:27.640 --> 07:31.760
Tell me what you've done in the last eight days to make money.

07:31.760 --> 07:35.440
It doesn't include dicking around on Weebly and doing this.

07:35.440 --> 07:38.880
I'm talking about how many people have you asked for money?

07:38.880 --> 07:43.480
Last week, Porter asked somebody for money Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday,

07:43.480 --> 07:44.480
Saturday.

07:44.480 --> 07:46.640
He asked people for money six days of the week.

07:46.640 --> 07:48.240
No wonder he's at $11,700.

07:48.240 --> 07:53.880
Francesca, if you guys didn't know this, was it last Thursday?

07:53.880 --> 07:55.160
I can't remember.

07:55.160 --> 07:56.160
No.

07:56.160 --> 07:57.160
Sorry.

07:57.160 --> 07:58.160
Monday, she got on a call.

07:58.160 --> 08:00.560
She lost the deal.

08:00.560 --> 08:01.560
She lost.

08:01.560 --> 08:03.560
Tuesday, she got another call.

08:03.560 --> 08:05.120
That one went sideways.

08:05.960 --> 08:11.080
Yesterday afternoon, she got on another one and got the deal.

08:11.080 --> 08:15.080
It's little wonder that she's landed deals three of the last four weeks and she will

08:15.080 --> 08:18.880
land another one this week because I will make sure that she does.

08:18.880 --> 08:19.880
What are you doing?

08:19.880 --> 08:22.400
This is a rhetorical question, but I also would love for somebody to be brave enough

08:22.400 --> 08:23.400
to answer the question.

08:23.400 --> 08:25.280
By the way, I can't see your comments, so whatever you're commenting, I'm going to try

08:25.280 --> 08:29.620
to refresh it here in a second, but what are you doing?

08:29.620 --> 08:30.960
What are you doing?

08:30.960 --> 08:32.620
What are you doing with your business?

08:32.620 --> 08:33.880
When is enough going to be enough?

08:33.880 --> 08:34.880
When are you going to stop?

08:35.640 --> 08:39.760
Are you going to really see how pathetic it is that you not only paid money to be in here,

08:39.760 --> 08:43.120
but you're actually not doing anything?

08:43.120 --> 08:46.280
You're actually not ... What I think I should start doing is when you come in, you pay the

08:46.280 --> 08:50.920
money and you give me some ridiculously embarrassing piece of information that I can blackmail

08:50.920 --> 08:54.200
you with, and if you don't hit your damn goals, I'm going to post it online.

08:54.200 --> 09:00.120
Maybe that would be the thing, but guys, it's like every day I'm sitting here and I'm looking

09:00.120 --> 09:03.640
at certain people that keep talking, I'm going to do it.

09:03.680 --> 09:06.560
I saw a bunch of comments, oh, I got the kick in the pants from Nick.

09:06.560 --> 09:08.040
Cool, what have you done?

09:08.040 --> 09:11.960
What have you done?

09:11.960 --> 09:15.400
I hope you understand, some of you guys are probably sitting there going, well, Nick,

09:15.400 --> 09:16.400
what does it matter?

09:16.400 --> 09:17.400
You've already gotten paid.

09:17.400 --> 09:19.400
It means everything.

09:19.400 --> 09:21.920
How do I keep growing this group?

09:21.920 --> 09:29.280
How do I get feedback on what's working, what's not, if you guys aren't doing anything?

09:29.280 --> 09:32.800
To be honest, I feel like I'm like my football coach back in high school when everyone just

09:32.800 --> 09:36.080
wanted to grow their hair out and be cool and they didn't really want to hit the gym

09:36.080 --> 09:40.080
and eat good and they cared way more about being cool than they did about actually winning

09:40.080 --> 09:41.080
football games.

09:41.080 --> 09:42.360
I was like, dude, this guy's psycho.

09:42.360 --> 09:45.800
I'm the psycho now.

09:45.800 --> 09:46.800
Read the slide edge.

09:46.800 --> 09:50.120
Read 10 pages of the slide edge every single day.

09:50.120 --> 09:53.040
Do that and implement what it says in that book.

09:53.040 --> 09:54.720
I gave you guys the book.

09:54.720 --> 09:57.320
I know Porter's reading it because I'm following up with him.

09:57.320 --> 09:58.320
I hit Kyle up today.

09:58.320 --> 09:59.960
I said, Kyle, are you reading your book?

09:59.960 --> 10:00.960
Yes.

10:00.960 --> 10:01.960
Are you doing your sales training every day?

10:02.120 --> 10:03.120
Yes.

10:03.120 --> 10:04.120
Are you hitting the gym every day?

10:04.120 --> 10:05.120
Yes.

10:05.120 --> 10:06.120
Boom.

10:06.120 --> 10:07.120
Little wonder.

10:07.120 --> 10:08.120
He's only lost three deals this entire month.

10:08.120 --> 10:09.440
He's closing above 90%.

10:09.440 --> 10:11.960
Go figure.

10:11.960 --> 10:13.960
Go freaking figure.

10:13.960 --> 10:17.480
Paul King says he converted two commission clients to flat rate, got a referral, charged

10:17.480 --> 10:19.200
them a set up fee to build himself.

10:19.200 --> 10:20.200
Beautiful.

10:20.200 --> 10:21.200
Paul King doing work.

10:21.200 --> 10:22.600
Post it, bro.

10:22.600 --> 10:23.600
Post that crap, bro.

10:23.600 --> 10:24.600
I want to know.

10:24.600 --> 10:29.360
By the way, for these that are shy about posting, people are going to judge who cares.

10:29.360 --> 10:31.800
It's way ... You're going to get ... That's awesome, dude.

10:32.640 --> 10:33.640
You're making moves.

10:33.640 --> 10:34.640
You're shaking moves.

10:34.640 --> 10:35.640
Some of you guys are like, oh, I want to get a post.

10:35.640 --> 10:38.080
By the way, most of the deals that we've been landing lately are just smaller deals.

10:38.080 --> 10:39.240
Guess what?

10:39.240 --> 10:42.040
We're building that muscle of asking people for money on landing deals.

10:42.040 --> 10:43.040
Paul, great job.

10:43.040 --> 10:44.040
Make a post about it.

10:44.040 --> 10:45.040
Let's let people know about it.

10:45.040 --> 10:48.040
Let's get people excited.

10:48.040 --> 10:52.240
What are you guys freaking ... I'm so glad that Paul said something.

10:52.240 --> 10:53.480
I'm going to give Francesca a shout out.

10:53.480 --> 10:56.040
I'm going to yell at her for not posting about it if she hasn't already, haven't checked

10:56.040 --> 10:57.760
the group.

10:57.760 --> 10:58.760
Francesca's doing work.

10:58.760 --> 10:59.760
Porter's doing work.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.000
Kyle's doing work.

11:01.200 --> 11:03.840
My inner circle's doing work because I'm making them.

11:03.840 --> 11:06.320
I'm not making them, but I'm hopefully inspiring them.

11:06.320 --> 11:08.080
I'm telling them, like, hey, I'm going to hold you accountable.

11:08.080 --> 11:11.600
I texted Kyle this morning, like I said, and I'm like, I'm holding you accountable, bro.

11:11.600 --> 11:13.480
Have you done this, this, and this?

11:13.480 --> 11:16.160
I have a group chat with my two brothers, not just Porter, my other one.

11:16.160 --> 11:18.800
I'm like, hey, are you guys reading ... They're also reading the book.

11:18.800 --> 11:25.280
What are you doing?

11:25.280 --> 11:27.040
You paid to be here.

11:27.040 --> 11:29.840
You paid great money to be here.

11:29.960 --> 11:31.960
I'm showing up every single week.

11:31.960 --> 11:38.120
I'm constantly giving you guys new things to think about, new things to work on.

11:38.120 --> 11:39.320
We have amazing support.

11:39.320 --> 11:40.680
You guys have somebody that helps you with ads.

11:40.680 --> 11:42.520
You guys have somebody that helps you with all tech issues.

11:42.520 --> 11:43.520
You guys have Kyle.

11:43.520 --> 11:44.520
You have myself.

11:44.520 --> 11:45.520
You have Ashley.

11:45.520 --> 11:46.520
You have Porter.

11:46.520 --> 11:48.440
You have Jason.

11:48.440 --> 11:55.560
You have the exact blueprint that we used to close three other last four weeks closed

11:55.560 --> 11:57.960
deals that Porter's using.

11:57.960 --> 12:00.840
He's at $11,700 per month.

12:00.840 --> 12:02.800
What are you doing?

12:02.800 --> 12:03.800
What the heck are you doing?

12:03.800 --> 12:06.880
I want you to think about it like that.

12:06.880 --> 12:11.880
Before you get angry or get frustrated that I keep coming at you, I'm going to keep coming

12:11.880 --> 12:13.360
at you because I want you to feel bad.

12:13.360 --> 12:17.480
I want you to feel like scum because if you're in this group and you're not doing anything,

12:17.480 --> 12:18.920
then you should.

12:18.920 --> 12:23.200
If you didn't ask somebody for money today, if you didn't prospect, guys, every single

12:23.400 --> 12:30.400
one of you, if you're not on the phone every single day, Monday through Friday, go ahead,

12:30.400 --> 12:31.400
take the weekend off.

12:31.400 --> 12:32.400
I don't care.

12:32.400 --> 12:36.160
I know when I was coming up, I was working Saturday mornings minimum and I have kids

12:36.160 --> 12:39.640
and I got other stuff too, but I was working Saturday mornings doing sales calls.

12:39.640 --> 12:44.600
I was doing something sales related every single day of the week.

12:44.600 --> 12:48.080
You may not have the ability to ask somebody for money every single day because you don't

12:48.080 --> 12:51.040
have enough deals in the pipe.

12:51.080 --> 12:56.840
Every single one of you should be on the phone doing prospecting calls every single day,

12:56.840 --> 12:59.160
but Nick, I don't have a campaign that's generating leads.

12:59.160 --> 13:00.160
Who cares?

13:00.160 --> 13:02.360
Go pick a random city and practice.

13:02.360 --> 13:06.320
Get good at doing it while you're waiting or go hook somebody in advance.

13:06.320 --> 13:10.320
Find the area that you want to go into and hook somebody while you wait for the leads

13:10.320 --> 13:11.320
to come in.

13:11.320 --> 13:13.640
I mean, heaven forbid.

13:13.640 --> 13:19.000
Guys, the work that actually moves the needle is talking to business owners, doing sales.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.260
That's the work that matters.

13:20.260 --> 13:22.220
How much have you done this week?

13:22.220 --> 13:25.380
My guess is that 99% of you guys haven't done jack shit.

13:25.380 --> 13:27.500
That's the truth.

13:27.500 --> 13:28.500
That's the truth.

13:28.500 --> 13:30.020
Well, I watched some training videos.

13:30.020 --> 13:31.700
I watched the live.

13:31.700 --> 13:34.260
I spent an hour looking at due diligence.

13:34.260 --> 13:35.260
Cool.

13:35.260 --> 13:36.260
Good job.

13:36.260 --> 13:37.620
Go do 100, then outsource it.

13:37.620 --> 13:39.060
Go do 100 due diligence.

13:39.060 --> 13:41.920
Master the process of finding a city and niche.

13:41.920 --> 13:47.100
Go hire someone for pennies in the Philippines and get that off your plate and focus on sales.

13:47.100 --> 13:48.900
Oh, but I wrote content.

13:48.900 --> 13:49.900
Awesome.

13:50.540 --> 13:52.780
Get 20,000 words of content for your first five websites.

13:52.780 --> 13:55.860
Train somebody for the Philippines or Africa or whatever.

13:55.860 --> 13:56.860
Create a process.

13:56.860 --> 13:57.860
Outsource it.

13:57.860 --> 13:58.860
Spend more time on sales.

13:58.860 --> 13:59.860
You want to make more money?

13:59.860 --> 14:01.500
Spend more time on sales.

14:01.500 --> 14:04.180
Don't sit there and think that you're doing work because you're watching videos or you're

14:04.180 --> 14:09.340
listening to freaking Joe Rogan or you're listening to Jocko Willink talking about

14:09.340 --> 14:11.720
getting in the ice bath.

14:11.720 --> 14:12.720
Do sales.

14:12.720 --> 14:16.460
Call people.

14:16.460 --> 14:18.060
Knock on doors.

14:18.060 --> 14:19.060
Do anything.

14:19.220 --> 14:20.580
Listen to Facebook group.

14:20.580 --> 14:22.580
Call your dad who's a real estate agent.

14:22.580 --> 14:24.360
Call your uncle who's a real estate agent.

14:24.360 --> 14:25.360
Go do something.

14:25.360 --> 14:26.360
Okay?

14:26.360 --> 14:27.360
But don't sit there.

14:27.360 --> 14:28.360
Oh, my campaign.

14:28.360 --> 14:29.360
I'm just waiting for my campaign.

14:29.360 --> 14:31.260
Just waiting for you to come in.

14:31.260 --> 14:35.460
Let me message Fix It Felix and ask another question.

14:35.460 --> 14:36.460
Go do some work.

14:36.460 --> 14:37.460
Okay?

14:37.460 --> 14:38.460
It's been a long 10 cents.

14:38.460 --> 14:41.400
I dropped the F word on this and I'm getting close on this call.

14:41.400 --> 14:45.220
Go do some actual work and quit talking about the work you're going to do and start doing

14:45.220 --> 14:46.220
the actual work.

14:46.380 --> 14:51.100
I'm going to start treating this as if I have not made any money and then until you guys

14:51.100 --> 14:52.980
get a deal, I have not made any money.

14:52.980 --> 14:55.020
I'm going to have to frame my mind like that and that's how I'm going to start treating

14:55.020 --> 14:56.020
you guys.

14:56.020 --> 15:01.940
And the reality is that the way that most of you are acting and if I had structured this

15:01.940 --> 15:07.740
program as I only get paid if you guys make money, 90% of you I wouldn't have let in this

15:07.740 --> 15:08.740
program.

15:08.740 --> 15:11.420
90% of you I wouldn't have let in here because you're not doing shit.

15:11.420 --> 15:13.420
You're not doing anything.

15:13.420 --> 15:15.820
And I would have known from the beginning that you weren't going to do anything because

15:15.820 --> 15:18.140
it's a bunch of fuzz.

15:18.140 --> 15:21.420
It's a bunch of just talking.

15:21.420 --> 15:25.820
Most of you guys don't actually have enough pain that you want to get out of your situation.

15:25.820 --> 15:28.660
You're just comfortable being in freaking mediocre-ville.

15:28.660 --> 15:29.660
Awesome dude.

15:29.660 --> 15:30.660
Congrats.

15:30.660 --> 15:31.660
Congrats.

15:31.660 --> 15:32.660
Go ahead and keep doing it.

15:32.660 --> 15:33.660
And blame me.

15:33.660 --> 15:34.660
Blame me.

15:34.660 --> 15:35.660
Program doesn't work.

15:35.660 --> 15:36.660
Works for Porter.

15:36.660 --> 15:37.660
Works for Kyle.

15:37.660 --> 15:38.660
Works for Francesca.

15:38.660 --> 15:39.660
Made me millions.

15:39.660 --> 15:40.660
Made Ryan Dalton a millionaire.

15:40.660 --> 15:43.140
But it doesn't work for you because you have a special scenario.

15:43.140 --> 15:44.140
I get it.

15:44.140 --> 15:45.140
I get it.

15:45.460 --> 15:52.820
90% of you, yes this is you, I wouldn't have let in this program if I only got paid on

15:52.820 --> 15:54.300
you getting deals.

15:54.300 --> 15:58.180
And not because it doesn't work, but because you're not doing anything.

15:58.180 --> 15:59.180
Because you're not doing anything.

15:59.180 --> 16:00.620
And it's sad.

16:00.620 --> 16:01.820
It's a damn shame.

16:01.820 --> 16:04.820
That's the truth.

16:04.820 --> 16:07.980
Raphael, pitch the business on last Friday.

16:07.980 --> 16:08.980
Great.

16:08.980 --> 16:09.980
Post it, dude.

16:09.980 --> 16:10.980
I love freaking hearing that.

16:10.980 --> 16:12.540
Raphael, pitch it.

16:12.540 --> 16:13.540
That's work.

16:13.540 --> 16:14.540
Pitch the deal.

16:14.940 --> 16:15.940
Call the business owner.

16:15.940 --> 16:16.940
That's work.

16:16.940 --> 16:17.940
Pitch the business owner last Friday.

16:17.940 --> 16:19.740
Waiting for lead to offer him.

16:19.740 --> 16:20.740
Great.

16:20.740 --> 16:22.900
Google CPC was too expensive for me so I started Facebook.

16:22.900 --> 16:23.900
That's great.

16:23.900 --> 16:24.900
Cool.

16:24.900 --> 16:25.900
Doing work.

16:25.900 --> 16:26.900
Jason says we need to be held accountable.

16:26.900 --> 16:27.900
Thanks, Nick.

16:27.900 --> 16:28.900
We'll have to be called out.

16:28.900 --> 16:29.900
Jason, somebody who's at $13,000.

16:29.900 --> 16:32.340
Of course, it's always the people that are actually doing work that don't mind being

16:32.340 --> 16:34.620
called out because they're actually doing the work.

16:34.620 --> 16:35.620
Go figure.

16:35.620 --> 16:36.620
Okay.

16:36.620 --> 16:38.780
It's funny that the people that are always sitting at the front of the meetings, when

16:38.780 --> 16:43.380
you have the meetings that you're supposed to be at when no one sales, the bagel meetings,

16:43.380 --> 16:45.340
you don't even have to be there if you got sales.

16:45.340 --> 16:49.480
The people that got the sales are the ones on the front row with the pen and paper, ready

16:49.480 --> 16:50.480
to learn.

16:50.480 --> 16:51.480
That's Jason Allred.

16:51.480 --> 16:59.660
That's why he's going to be a millionaire with his business, okay?

16:59.660 --> 17:03.620
I wish we were in person so I could freaking just like ring some necks, okay?

17:03.620 --> 17:06.420
Anyway, guys, I'm not giving up on you.

17:06.420 --> 17:08.300
I want to just be like, hey, I'm done.

17:08.300 --> 17:09.300
I'm tired.

17:09.300 --> 17:10.300
Like, screw you guys.

17:10.300 --> 17:11.300
You don't want to make money.

17:11.420 --> 17:14.780
But I'm not going to do that because I know that you guys have the right model.

17:14.780 --> 17:16.140
I know you guys have the right vehicle.

17:16.140 --> 17:17.340
I've seen it change my life.

17:17.340 --> 17:21.380
It's literally completely transformed my entire world.

17:21.380 --> 17:24.360
It's allowed me to do things I never thought I'd be able to do at this age.

17:24.360 --> 17:29.860
It's allowed me to go places, buy things, take care of people I never thought I could

17:29.860 --> 17:33.300
do at this stage at 34 years old, okay?

17:33.300 --> 17:34.440
It got me out of debt.

17:34.440 --> 17:38.780
It's given me confidence that I can't even describe, that I can take care of those around

17:38.780 --> 17:40.580
me.

17:40.580 --> 17:46.220
It's done everything for me, this business model and this exact program, these steps,

17:46.220 --> 17:49.260
these scripts, these niches that I'm going into, these things that I'm talking about.

17:49.260 --> 17:54.700
You guys are so damn tired of getting messages about, oh, this doesn't work.

17:54.700 --> 17:55.940
You didn't know where the script's at?

17:55.940 --> 18:00.660
Dude, if you don't know how to find something in the Facebook group, then just ask AI.

18:00.660 --> 18:01.660
You know what you could do?

18:01.660 --> 18:05.460
Go to chat GPT or Google, which has AI at the top.

18:05.460 --> 18:09.580
How do I find an answer to my question in the Facebook group?

18:09.580 --> 18:11.580
Some of you guys need to do that, okay?

18:11.580 --> 18:14.820
Quote waste of my time sending me a message about where the script is.

18:14.820 --> 18:15.820
Go look.

18:15.820 --> 18:16.820
Go freaking look.

18:16.820 --> 18:22.020
I was watching this video yesterday about learning, how to learn, and the guy's like,

18:22.020 --> 18:23.740
you should outline the project.

18:23.740 --> 18:28.420
You should say, hey, here's what I want to do is I'm going to build this project and

18:28.420 --> 18:31.820
then start, and then you're going to have the questions that you need to answer, and

18:31.820 --> 18:33.300
then you're going to go find those answers.

18:33.300 --> 18:34.300
Guess what?

18:34.300 --> 18:37.420
Because you had to struggle, because you had to look, you actually are going to remember

18:37.420 --> 18:38.980
the things that you found.

18:38.980 --> 18:43.260
Why do you guys think that when you message me 400 times to get an answer that takes

18:43.260 --> 18:47.340
you 10 seconds to find, I don't respond, or I tell my team to hold off?

18:47.340 --> 18:51.900
Because if I'm just sitting there spoon feeding you, I'm turning you into nothing.

18:51.900 --> 18:54.260
You're not going to become anything.

18:54.260 --> 18:59.020
Guys, it's every answer to every one of your questions, I promise you, is in this group.

18:59.020 --> 19:00.420
This group's been around for three years.

19:00.420 --> 19:01.420
Every question's been asked.

19:01.420 --> 19:04.420
If it's not here, it's in the Q&A section of the Kajabi training.

19:04.420 --> 19:06.420
If it's not there, it's in one of the modules.

19:06.420 --> 19:07.740
You're going to have to look a little bit, but guess what?

19:07.740 --> 19:11.820
You're actually going to remember it.

19:11.820 --> 19:15.900
Stop spending time on stupid stuff.

19:15.900 --> 19:17.780
Stop.

19:17.780 --> 19:21.220
