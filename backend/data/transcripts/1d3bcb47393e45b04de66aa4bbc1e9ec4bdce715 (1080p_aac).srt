1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,440
So should I split out the ads, like for,

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:04,920
let's say I do three ads for concrete,

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,040
like one is driveway, one is cement, one is patio.

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,540
Should I do it all in one or split it into three?

5
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:15,240
So repeat that question again.

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,160
So you're saying split the budget into three?

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,700
Yeah, or make three separate ads.

8
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:26,040
Like do only one ad that concentrates on cement keywords,

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,160
do another ad that only concentrates on patio keywords?

10
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:33,280
You know what?

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,480
That's a really good question.

12
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,080
I don't wanna give you guys,

13
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,640
I would not wanna give you advice that,

14
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,480
and I said this at the beginning of the call,

15
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,320
this would be a question

16
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,420
I would much rather fix it paid ads answer.

17
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,720
What I would want you to do on this question,

18
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,760
and I don't know if you caught this,

19
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,880
but we're actually redoing again the training on the ads

20
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,420
and also the entire training.

21
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,180
But for this specific question,

22
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,260
I think this would be valuable for everybody.

23
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,700
If you would post that, just that simple question,

24
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,120
say, whatever, post that in the group,

25
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,540
and then if you want to go a step further

26
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:07,500
and make a quick little loom and send it to me

27
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,620
and fix it paid ads, I'll give you an in-depth answer,

28
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:13,700
but I don't wanna just shoot something off the hip.

29
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,100
So would you do that for me?

30
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,260
Yeah, I'll definitely do that.

31
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,620
The only reason I ask is because

32
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,860
when you have targeted keywords for that ad,

33
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,700
you get to that 100%, how good the ad is.

34
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,820
You get poor, good, and excellent.

35
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,820
If it's all related,

36
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,700
you get closer to the excellent faster, that's why.

37
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,540
My knee-jerk reaction is I would tell you

38
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,300
to do a separate ad for each,

39
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:42,580
because yes, that is the relevancy,

40
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:43,440
that's really gonna help,

41
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,580
and we've noticed that that's been a big thing

42
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,740
with the way that we're doing ads now.

43
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,660
However, I also don't want to,

44
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,300
if there's somebody out there that's listening to this

45
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,140
and they hear, oh, three ads,

46
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,920
I would rather you just get them up

47
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,960
than not get them up at all.

48
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,500
So if that's causing analysis paralysis, no,

49
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,540
but yes, 100% what you're saying,

50
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,980
I think that is gonna be the answer.

51
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,060
But I would love for you to post that.

52
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:04,900
Let's get everyone's feedback.

53
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,660
I'll get fix it paid ads in there.
