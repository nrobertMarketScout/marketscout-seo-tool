Hey, what do I do when you know, I've got somebody on trial and

00:05.840 --> 00:07.840
The leads are slow

00:08.200 --> 00:14.200
You know, the leads are a little bit slower than I thought. What do I do? Okay guys just set the proper expectations

00:14.200 --> 00:15.540
What when I get on I say hey look

00:15.540 --> 00:21.280
I'm gonna send you a couple more leads and I always say this I say for these first couple they I want to get you

00:21.280 --> 00:25.840
Really juicy leads. So I'm not gonna send you any of the the rinky-dink stuff

00:25.880 --> 00:31.000
So it might be a little bit inconsistent. You might get one today one in a couple days, you know

00:31.000 --> 00:32.040
You might get two in a day

00:32.040 --> 00:35.880
It's gonna be a little bit hit and miss but I want to make sure to get you really nice jobs

00:36.320 --> 00:40.320
So just just a heads up in case you get one from me and then you don't hear from me for a couple days

00:40.320 --> 00:44.200
That's why okay. That's all you got to say that problem solved
