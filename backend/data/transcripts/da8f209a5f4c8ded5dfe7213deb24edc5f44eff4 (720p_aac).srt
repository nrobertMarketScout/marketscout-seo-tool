1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,040
I'm having some trouble getting my list together.

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,800
I've got about six or seven businesses,

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,800
a few from Google Ads, HomeAdvisor, and Thumbtack.

4
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,120
That enough?

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,760
Yeah, Kenny, it takes one.

6
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,160
It takes one.

7
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,080
I think a lot of times you think because you've

8
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,600
worked the call center or you've seen some of these movies,

9
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,240
you think you need like this couple hundred list.

10
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,600
No, some of my lists are five people.

11
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,360
Some of my lists are five people, but I know their name,

12
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:28,200
I know their company, I know all the details about them,

13
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,720
I know where they're ranked on Google,

14
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,040
and I call and I'm snipering instead of doing the shotgun approach.

15
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,680
Yeah, six and seven could be great.

16
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:40,640
Okay. You might go through the six or seven and nothing hits.

17
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,720
I wouldn't tell you to give up on that.

18
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:48,520
I wouldn't tell you to give up on that city.

19
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,040
I would tell you if you go through all those people

20
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,360
and you've literally they're just not interested,

21
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,920
pause everything and then go and do another campaign,

22
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,200
do another deal, get a deal,

23
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,440
come back with a fresher set eyes and some momentum and you'll have a different result.

24
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,640
Okay. Yeah, that is enough.
