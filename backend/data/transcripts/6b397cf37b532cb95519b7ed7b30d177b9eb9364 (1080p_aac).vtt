Mike Willett, if you place additional ads

00:03.260 --> 00:05.900
per one of your recent videos,

00:05.900 --> 00:08.760
does it affect the five to seven day indexing?

00:09.700 --> 00:14.700
Yes, that was adding more headlines or more ads

00:15.180 --> 00:17.220
and a few more descriptions in your ads.

00:17.220 --> 00:20.540
And it just helps better optimize your smart campaign.

00:21.880 --> 00:22.720
Amazing.
