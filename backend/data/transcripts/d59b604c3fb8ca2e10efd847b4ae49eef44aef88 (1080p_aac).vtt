WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.840
Beautiful. Okay, so I see Doug, Shane Noble, Jahill, Stephanie's iPhone, Kurt, Steven Westover,

00:10.840 --> 00:17.320
Discord users, always Discord user, Frank, Shane, and then me and you. Okay, beautiful.

00:17.320 --> 00:24.320
Let's see, Isaac, sorry, Aaron, would you just keep an eye on the people that join?

00:25.040 --> 00:33.440
Absolutely. Okay, awesome. Okay, so real quick guys, welcome to the call first and foremost. Secondly,

00:34.240 --> 00:39.680
if you guys, there are a few people in here that I recognize that are inside of our program,

00:39.680 --> 00:43.840
which is cool, and I'm going to just mention this really quick because there are a couple.

00:46.160 --> 00:52.800
One of the biggest questions that people have had recently, it seems like for the past six months,

00:53.760 --> 01:03.200
is what is the minimum search volume for a keyword plus city that would indicate that this city,

01:03.200 --> 01:08.000
you can go into the city? What's the bare minimum search volume? That's a very frequently asked

01:08.000 --> 01:15.040
question. Would you not agree with that, Aaron? Definitely. And we've purposely, when we first

01:15.040 --> 01:22.400
started talking about this stuff, when we first started our program back in 2021, I was using,

01:22.560 --> 01:28.960
I had been using SEMrush or SEMrush for years. And so I was like, okay, this is what I use,

01:28.960 --> 01:34.480
whatever. But the problem with that is that that tool is all over the place, right? And

01:35.680 --> 01:41.920
let's just be honest, every single tool is. And so basically what we said and we've been saying,

01:41.920 --> 01:45.120
and I still stand by it, is that whatever tool you want to use, whether it's Google Keyword

01:45.120 --> 01:50.400
Plan or Mangools, SEMrush, blah, blah, blah, blah, whatever you want to use, you need to just find a

01:50.400 --> 01:55.920
baseline for what is a, you know, you take a website, for example, that's ranking.

01:57.200 --> 02:00.720
Let's say I have Bentonville Concrete. I always use that example because I know exactly how many

02:00.720 --> 02:07.440
leads I get every month. It's ranking for GMB. It's ranking for organic for the major seven

02:07.440 --> 02:12.320
keywords, basically. And I know how many leads I get. And then I look at what the tool says.

02:12.320 --> 02:17.040
And based on that, I can set kind of like a baseline. So that's going to be our advice.

02:17.040 --> 02:21.600
That's what I've been saying. So I've been using. And the reason why we haven't said,

02:21.600 --> 02:26.960
hey, this is the tool that says this, et cetera, is because we haven't really wanted to

02:27.520 --> 02:32.800
basically endorse any tool. But anyway, all I'm saying now is that we have been working on

02:32.800 --> 02:38.560
something for like, I think it's been about 15, 16 months where we're pulling data directly from

02:38.560 --> 02:44.160
Google to show that search volume. That's one of the functions it does. It also does like the due

02:44.160 --> 02:48.240
diligence in, what is it, like three seconds, Aaron? Two and a half, baby.

02:49.200 --> 02:53.840
Yeah, it's ridiculous. So I used to spend 30 to 45 minutes on a due diligence. Now you literally

02:53.840 --> 03:01.120
put in the keywords. It's honestly three seconds. So by the way, I'm going to take care of that one

03:01.120 --> 03:07.360
that just tried to join. Oh, sorry. I think I, okay, cool. Okay. Anyway, guys, for those of you

03:07.360 --> 03:10.320
that weren't on my, if you are in digital landlords, you have no idea what I'm talking

03:10.320 --> 03:15.440
about most likely. If you guys are curious about what that is, we are doing the beta test for that.

03:16.320 --> 03:20.560
We've had some really good feedback so far. I've been playing around a lot with the tool.

03:21.280 --> 03:25.760
So DM, just DM me actually privately, because I'll send you the information on that,

03:25.760 --> 03:31.280
because I'm going to send you a recording that we did. But that is the beta. It is a paid beta,

03:31.280 --> 03:34.640
but there's a discount on it. So anyway, just wanted to mention that really quick as we get

03:34.640 --> 03:39.920
into it. And with that said, I think let's get into the call. Happy freaking Monday.

03:41.040 --> 03:49.600
Here's what I want to do in the chat really quick. In the next, let's just say the next six weeks,

03:50.240 --> 03:57.760
okay, the next six weeks. So from mid October to the 1st of December, how, and I want everyone to

03:57.760 --> 04:05.440
respond on this guys. How much revenue top line are you guys going to add to your business? Now,

04:05.440 --> 04:10.800
I'm not talking about your goal, but I'm talking about, I always call this your die goal or your

04:10.800 --> 04:18.160
junkie goal, which is if you don't, you're going to hit this number or like I'm flinging myself off

04:18.160 --> 04:22.800
of a bridge type of thing, which is a little bit much, but I'm just trying to paint the picture

04:22.800 --> 04:26.880
here. Like that is the goal that I'm hitting no matter what, no matter what. How much are you guys

04:26.880 --> 04:32.160
going to add each one of you guys? Yeah, not your goal, but your actual, like I am going to do this.

04:32.720 --> 04:38.400
Kurt's going for 10k. I love that. Who else? Who else in six weeks? You got six weeks to do it.

04:39.360 --> 04:42.880
Who else is going to do 20? Oh, okay. I thought I said 25. I was like, dude,

04:42.880 --> 04:49.920
Jahill's going in dude. He's got the, he's sipping the coffee this morning. 2k. I want everyone to

04:49.920 --> 04:54.560
give me a, he's laughing. I want everyone to give me a 500k. There we go. No big deal.

04:55.200 --> 05:01.600
Everybody tell me, I want to know Shane Noble, 2,500 bucks. That's two deals. Could be one deal.

05:01.600 --> 05:08.560
Steph, Stephen, sorry, 2,500. Doug, 2k. Who we missing? I want to know what Stephanie says. Stephanie,

05:10.240 --> 05:15.200
we've missed a couple people. I think her audio is still connecting. Yeah. Okay. No problem. Shane,

05:15.200 --> 05:22.160
I'm new. Currently saving for digital landlords. Okay. Beautiful. Shane, by the way, shoot me a

05:23.120 --> 05:29.120
message after. Might have something interesting for you because we're a created bunch over here

05:29.120 --> 05:35.520
and it sucks to be sitting there waiting. So shoot me a message after Shane. So guys, 10k,

05:36.400 --> 05:44.080
2k, 25. By the way, Kurt is in China. Is that correct? Am I right on that, Kurt?

05:44.880 --> 05:48.960
That's beautiful. So he's going to sling 10k from China. That's the power of the internet, baby.

05:49.920 --> 05:56.400
Guys, my agency, I don't really spend a ton of time in it personally. I've kind of advised

05:56.400 --> 06:02.160
Francesca, but we're going to do the same thing. We're going to go and add another 10k in the next

06:02.160 --> 06:07.040
six weeks. And I'm going to try something that's going to be slightly different than I've done in

06:07.040 --> 06:14.480
the past. I've had a few different months and little sprints where we've done 10k added revenue

06:14.480 --> 06:17.760
and there's no better feeling. What I would recommend you guys doing is setting a goal

06:17.840 --> 06:23.520
from now until the 1st of December. And if you hit it, you're going to treat yourself to something,

06:23.520 --> 06:28.800
not anything crazy, but just have that goal. Get excited. I know that this time of year,

06:29.600 --> 06:33.920
a lot of people take their foot off the gas. A lot of people are like, I'm prepping for the

06:33.920 --> 06:40.240
holidays. I got Thanksgiving, whatever. And that's exactly why you should have your foot on the gas

06:40.240 --> 06:43.520
because that means that less people are going to be calling these business owners, right?

06:43.600 --> 06:49.280
It means that for me, when I know that no one else is up doing stuff, I'm more motivated than

06:49.280 --> 06:55.920
if I know everyone is. And I promise you that half the people that are doing this right now or more

06:55.920 --> 06:58.960
are going to be taking their foot off the gas and they're going to be saying, oh, it's Christmas.

06:58.960 --> 07:04.640
I'm going to start the 1st of the year. So also if you're thinking, oh my gosh, my business owners,

07:04.640 --> 07:10.080
they're not going to be hungry. Guess what? The hungry business owners are still doing business.

07:10.080 --> 07:15.520
The hungry business owners are still making moves. It's basically going to be this filter for the

07:15.520 --> 07:18.960
people you don't want to work with anyway because we all know those business owners that you call

07:18.960 --> 07:23.280
and they're like, well, I'm not doing anything until like March. That's not someone you want

07:23.280 --> 07:30.480
to work with anyway. So anyway, guys, I truly, in fact, let's do this. Aaron, I want you to

07:30.480 --> 07:38.240
screenshot every answer that we just got. And I want, when we get to the 1st of December,

07:38.800 --> 07:44.320
whoever hits their goal that they put in here, I want you to message me and remind me. And I've

07:44.320 --> 07:50.320
got something for you guys. Okay. And you can hold me to that. You guys can hold me to that. Okay.

07:51.120 --> 07:54.640
All right. Let's do this again, guys. I'm going to talk about five mistakes

07:55.280 --> 08:02.160
that cost me literally, I told Aaron in the title of this to say hundreds of thousands of dollars

08:02.160 --> 08:06.960
because when you say millions, it sounds like you're just using that as like some catch

08:06.960 --> 08:13.040
whatever. It sounds kind of cliche, but I would definitely say millions. Now that I got you guys

08:13.040 --> 08:18.560
on the call, but we wanted to say hundreds of thousands, but I genuinely can trace back

08:18.560 --> 08:22.880
millions of dollars lost off of these five mistakes. Okay. So I'm going to go through

08:22.880 --> 08:28.640
these five mistakes and then any questions you guys have on them, I'm going to expand on them a bit.

08:29.440 --> 08:31.920
And then also we're going to have a little bit of time for Q&A. Okay.

08:31.920 --> 08:37.120
Okay. Let me just shut my door. Kids are still sleeping. Hold on.

08:47.440 --> 08:52.880
Okay. Everyone can still hear me, right? Give me a thumbs up if we can.

08:53.680 --> 09:00.640
Yeah. Beautiful. Okay. Guys, I hope you guys are pumped about digital real estate. I know sometimes

09:00.640 --> 09:03.600
when you get in the game for a while, I see some names I've seen for a long time.

09:05.200 --> 09:09.280
You know, sometimes you get in that you go from honeymoon stage, like some of you guys are new

09:09.280 --> 09:14.720
to this and the honeymoon stage is so exciting. You know, it's new, it's fresh. The idea of you

09:14.720 --> 09:22.000
being able to make money while you're golfing, while you're traveling, while you're doing whatever,

09:22.800 --> 09:26.720
it's exciting and it's fun because it's just the idea and you don't have to do anything. And then

09:26.720 --> 09:31.280
once you get into the actual game, you're like, oh my gosh, this is going to take work. I'm going

09:31.280 --> 09:36.480
to have to do X amount of due diligence before I even find my first city. And it becomes kind of

09:36.480 --> 09:42.160
heavy and you get kind of weighed down in the minutiae. But I just want you guys to know that

09:42.160 --> 09:50.080
I've been weighed down in the minutiae since 2016. And I've had times when I was way more

09:50.080 --> 09:55.760
excited about this. I had times when I was way less excited, but I can honestly tell you that

09:56.320 --> 10:00.240
this should tell you that this business model is what it is. And it's the most

10:00.800 --> 10:07.120
simplest business model on the internet is I genuinely like last night I was laying in bed

10:07.120 --> 10:11.760
and I was thinking about digital real estate. I know it sounds like I'm making that up or it

10:11.760 --> 10:17.440
sounds cheesy, whatever, but I was thinking about adding another $10,000 before December 1st.

10:18.320 --> 10:22.400
I actually want to do that in 30 days, but that's what I was thinking about last night. I've been

10:22.400 --> 10:28.480
doing this for eight freaking years. I've made millions of dollars doing this, but the idea that

10:28.480 --> 10:34.000
I could just go, Aaron, you can control the mute, right? Yeah. Beautiful. The idea that I can just

10:34.000 --> 10:40.560
go and add $10,000. Now let's call that $10,000. Let's say it's six of net, right? Just because of

10:40.560 --> 10:47.040
ads or whatever. And the fact that I can just go add a casual $6,000 to my bottom line per month,

10:47.600 --> 10:54.960
what is that? What's six times 12, Aaron? Give us the details. 72. 72. Okay. It's a little early.

10:54.960 --> 11:01.360
Don't ask me that question. If it's a nine, I got you on the multiplication. But so you guys,

11:01.360 --> 11:07.120
the fact that you can go and add 70, Kurt said he's going to add $10,000 in six weeks. You can

11:07.120 --> 11:15.760
go and add $72,000 to your bottom line just because you decided to. And it's not ongoing,

11:15.760 --> 11:19.360
it's not like one of these businesses like SMMA where it's like, okay, I just got

11:19.920 --> 11:25.840
10 new clients. I have 10 times the work. It's like, no, maybe you got 10 new clients and you

11:25.840 --> 11:30.720
did a lot of work for 60 days and then the work goes completely down and all you have to do is

11:30.720 --> 11:36.000
maintain it. Anyway, I don't know how you can't get excited about this. I'm pumped about it. I'm

11:36.000 --> 11:42.080
going to do another 10K of added revenue to my agency, not obviously to my program, just to my

11:42.080 --> 11:47.920
agency and I'm super pumped about it. So I hope you guys are pumped about it because I'm really

11:47.920 --> 11:52.880
excited about it. Even here, eight years later, coming up on the holidays, I couldn't be more

11:52.880 --> 11:57.440
excited about the holidays because no one else is going to be doing it and I am. Okay. So guys,

11:57.440 --> 12:03.120
five things that have literally cost me hundreds of thousands of dollars. I would definitely say

12:03.120 --> 12:06.480
millions, but let's go through these really, really quick and then we'll get into some Q&A.

12:06.480 --> 12:13.280
Okay. Number one, and these are in no particular order. These are just as I was sitting there and

12:13.280 --> 12:17.520
pondering, I'm like genuinely speaking, if I was having a conversation, me and Aaron were on a

12:17.520 --> 12:24.000
road trip, we're driving to Phoenix and he's like, Hey, what's cost you the most money?

12:24.000 --> 12:27.280
And I was sitting there and actually not just giving him an answer out of my back pocket,

12:27.280 --> 12:32.320
but I was giving him an answer that I truly felt were the things that cost me that money.

12:32.320 --> 12:40.720
These are the things I would say. Okay. Number one is not having my due diligence dialed. Okay.

12:40.720 --> 12:50.800
Now, what I mean by that is not having my formula of what is a good city and niche combination.

12:50.800 --> 12:59.440
Okay. Not having that perfect, not having that dialed that has cost me. I don't even know how

12:59.440 --> 13:04.720
I would calculate how much money that's cost me. Okay. And what happened to me in the beginning,

13:04.720 --> 13:10.480
guys, is I was so excited to get going. I was so excited to get started doing this,

13:10.480 --> 13:13.520
just like many of you are that you want to just take a city, you pick a niche,

13:13.520 --> 13:17.920
you go, you build whatever. And by the way, keep in mind, I was doing this the slow way

13:18.560 --> 13:21.520
because I didn't know there was another way to do this. And for those of you,

13:21.520 --> 13:26.080
if there's anyone on here that doesn't know what I mean by slow way, I'm talking about actually

13:26.080 --> 13:33.520
doing rank and rent, building a website, waiting for six months to rank and then going and selling

13:33.520 --> 13:37.440
it. So I was doing that. And I didn't even know there was an option that you could go and you

13:37.440 --> 13:42.000
could pre-sell it. You could go and get a deal this week and then build it out and know for sure

13:42.000 --> 13:46.000
that you have someone that's willing to pay. Okay. I didn't know any of that. And so keep in mind,

13:46.000 --> 13:50.640
I didn't even have a due diligence process that was dialed in. I wasn't confident in it.

13:50.640 --> 13:57.040
I was taking this advice from a group that was, I believe, a bit antiquated. And I just started

13:57.040 --> 14:04.000
building sites. And the advice that I got, guys, was just keep building sites, build 10, build 20,

14:04.000 --> 14:08.720
just keep building sites. And the justification that these people were giving me was, hey,

14:08.720 --> 14:15.840
if you build 10 sites, even if seven of them don't work and only three of them hit, the numbers still

14:15.840 --> 14:21.760
work. And it's like, okay, that's cool because these things are so cheap to build. But I don't

14:21.760 --> 14:27.360
have six months to wait for each project to see if it's going to work. And I also don't want to pay

14:27.360 --> 14:33.040
for hosting for six months on a website in a niche in a city that I'm never going to do. That's a

14:33.040 --> 14:40.800
waste of time and money. And so guys, for me, I made the mistake of just going too quick. And it's

14:40.800 --> 14:47.440
hard because I'm a big believer of just taking action before you have all the answers. But this

14:47.440 --> 14:53.200
piece of it, guys, the due diligence piece is one you don't want to mess up, okay? I'm all about

14:53.200 --> 14:58.320
going and taking action, starting the podcast before you have the cover art or before you have

14:58.320 --> 15:05.600
the intro, making the cold call before you have the exact script, just taking action. But guys,

15:05.600 --> 15:12.720
for you to commit to a six month project at the bare minimum, based on not knowing exactly what

15:13.760 --> 15:17.760
the due diligence needs to look like, what the metrics, what the formula needs to look like,

15:17.760 --> 15:24.240
that is financial suicide. And I have done it. And I've done it on both sides, right? I've

15:25.600 --> 15:30.640
done it in the right niche, but not had my city dialed and not known exactly what a city looks

15:30.640 --> 15:36.400
like and just being so concerned about population because somebody told me that I should look at

15:36.400 --> 15:42.560
population and thinking, okay, I can only work with cities between $300,000 and $700,000 or

15:42.560 --> 15:47.680
whatever it was. And having the right niche, but not knowing what a city looks like, not knowing

15:47.680 --> 15:53.520
what the competition looks like, not even looking at cost per click or any of those kinds of things

15:53.520 --> 15:59.280
and building, building, building, building in the right niche, but the wrong city. And then on the

15:59.280 --> 16:05.440
flip side, I've done the opposite where I've, you know, I've gone into the wrong city and niche.

16:05.440 --> 16:12.720
And I remember this specific time, guys, we, we had this client in foundation repair. Okay.

16:13.280 --> 16:16.960
And we, I don't even know how we necessarily got into it in the very beginning. I think it

16:16.960 --> 16:23.680
was kind of an accident and we got this deal in this city and it worked. It was like this

16:23.680 --> 16:28.720
miraculous event. It worked. We didn't even know what we were doing. We picked the city,

16:28.720 --> 16:34.640
the niche worked only because we had a good business owner and it was very, very not

16:34.640 --> 16:40.640
competitive and everything just kind of worked. And we falsely assumed that this was a good niche.

16:40.640 --> 16:45.840
Okay. So what did we do? We went, we started just hitting this niche super hard foundation,

16:45.840 --> 16:50.000
repair, foundation, repair, foundation, repair. This is the niche. This is the niche, not realizing

16:50.000 --> 16:55.920
we were about to get in the ring with some, some actual behemoths, some big freaking players. So

16:55.920 --> 17:01.760
people that were spending big dollars, we're, we're going against companies that were so big,

17:01.760 --> 17:06.560
they had their own internet marketing companies within the company. That was a separate entity

17:06.560 --> 17:12.800
that just serviced their freaking companies. I mean, it was ridiculous and we got our butts

17:12.800 --> 17:19.280
handed to us. We, we built over 50 websites for one, there was one client that was like,

17:19.280 --> 17:22.400
Hey, let's just go hard. We're like, yeah, let's go hard. So we're like, all right,

17:22.400 --> 17:26.160
we'll build 50 websites. We agreed again, another mistake I'm going to get to in a second.

17:26.160 --> 17:30.640
We agreed to a pay per lead deal, which is a huge mistake that we did. And that's actually number two

17:30.640 --> 17:35.680
I'm going to get into. And we got our butts handed to us to the point that I thought there was going

17:35.680 --> 17:41.200
to be like some serious, I just thought it was going to be a bad deal. Luckily, the guy ended

17:41.200 --> 17:47.440
up being cool. We, we didn't, we didn't have any kind of like, you know, guarantees. We were pretty

17:47.440 --> 17:51.520
good on expectations. So it didn't, it wasn't as bad as it thought. We had some really heated

17:51.520 --> 17:57.360
conversations, some really pissed. It was just a bad deal. And this was all because I didn't have

17:57.360 --> 18:02.480
my due diligence dial. Okay. So the next question people will be asking, well, how do I, what's the

18:02.480 --> 18:08.800
right due diligence? How do I pick a city? How do I pick a niche? You got two ways. Okay. What I did

18:08.800 --> 18:16.720
is I spent, you know, it took me a good solid four years of trial and error. Now the crazy part is,

18:16.720 --> 18:26.400
is I actually have spent about $23,000 on programs. And, and I, this is by the year of 2020.

18:26.400 --> 18:32.720
Okay. I spent $23,000 on programs. That's just rank and rent programs. And I still didn't have

18:32.720 --> 18:36.720
the due diligence process dialed in because all the ones that I bought, those people were not in

18:36.720 --> 18:41.440
the game. They were not, you know, like, for example, we just barely gave her a proposal.

18:41.840 --> 18:47.920
My agency, Evergreen, on Thursday morning, was it Thursday morning or Friday morning?

18:48.720 --> 18:54.480
It was Thursday morning. Thursday morning, we just gave her a proposal. It's, we gave an option

18:54.480 --> 19:03.680
proposal. It was for 7,500 or $10,000 per month. Okay. 75. So either option is going to be a

19:03.680 --> 19:08.400
fat chunk added. By the way, I'm not thinking, if you guys think that I'm like sandbagging this,

19:08.400 --> 19:14.160
that's not even what I'm thinking about in terms of this extra 10K. That deal to me is dead because

19:14.160 --> 19:18.480
they didn't do it on the call. It was an interesting deal because we had to talk to the marketing

19:18.480 --> 19:22.720
director who doesn't actually have the power to get on the call, to make the decision, but you're

19:22.720 --> 19:26.160
not going to get the owner on that call. So it was kind of one of those weird, bigger companies,

19:26.160 --> 19:31.280
but that I'm, that deal's dead to me. So when I say $10,000 additional by December 1st,

19:31.280 --> 19:36.880
I'm not even talking about that, but guys, we just did a proposal for 7,500 or $10,000,

19:36.880 --> 19:43.520
like four days ago. That's how much I'm in this game, right? I'm doing this every day. I'm looking

19:43.520 --> 19:48.480
at new niches. I'm talking, I'm voice noting Francesca constantly all day. What about this?

19:48.480 --> 19:55.360
What about this? And so to keep in mind that I was working with people and I was in programs and

19:55.360 --> 20:01.680
groups and none of those people were in the game, right? They did this once or twice or five times.

20:01.680 --> 20:06.000
They made 10,000 bucks. They had a good month and made 20,000 bucks. And then they're like,

20:06.000 --> 20:11.680
I'm going to go make a program. And the training was antiquated. It was never solved in the first

20:11.680 --> 20:18.800
place because they didn't really have a tried and true system. And I was following these advice and

20:18.800 --> 20:23.360
these different due diligence processes. And it got me into a lot of trouble. Okay. So you have

20:23.360 --> 20:28.960
two options. You can do what I did, which is kind of like flail around and spend four years and take

20:28.960 --> 20:34.960
advice from people that haven't done it or try to figure it out on your own, or you can buy time

20:34.960 --> 20:38.320
and you can go and get the due diligence process from somebody that has done it. And I think you

20:38.320 --> 20:43.600
guys know where you can get that. Okay. All right. So number one is not having my due diligence dialed.

20:43.600 --> 20:49.360
I always talk about this. I'll keep talking about this. Getting your city and niche dialed is the

20:49.360 --> 20:57.040
most important, is the single most important step in the process. Yes, getting the credit card is

20:57.040 --> 21:02.720
where it all ends or I guess it's where it begins, but it's where that deal is finalized. But you're

21:02.720 --> 21:07.680
never going to get to that point without picking the right city and niche. And even if you do get

21:07.680 --> 21:12.880
to that point, and even if you do get the deal, that deal is going to eventually die. If you're

21:12.880 --> 21:16.560
in the wrong city in the niche, in the wrong niche, because you're never going to rank your, your,

21:16.560 --> 21:23.600
your leads are going to be expensive. Like it's, this part is so vital and I, I, I can't stress it

21:23.600 --> 21:29.760
enough. Okay. All right. Number two, the number two reason, the number two thing that I, number

21:29.760 --> 21:35.360
two mistake that I made that cost me hundreds of thousands of dollars was doing pay per lead

21:35.360 --> 21:40.640
instead of flat fee. Now I have an entire YouTube video, maybe even two or three YouTube videos on

21:40.640 --> 21:47.440
this, but when I started in my mind, I always inherently knew that doing a commission deal was

21:47.440 --> 21:52.160
a bad idea. Right. And by the way, just so we're on the same page, doing a commission deal, meaning

21:52.160 --> 21:56.560
I'll send you leads. Let's say Aaron's my tree service guy. I'm going to send Aaron leads.

21:57.280 --> 22:03.280
He's going to pay me nothing except for a percentage of the deals that he closes. Okay. And

22:03.280 --> 22:07.280
usually they want to not only do that, but they want to pay you the net percentage. They want to

22:07.280 --> 22:10.720
say, Oh, I'm not even going to pay you on gross. I'm going to pay you on net. Like they want to

22:10.720 --> 22:16.960
have zero skin in the game. And these groups that I was in guys, a lot of people were doing

22:17.680 --> 22:23.360
commission deals and you know, they would make some money and I would see that, but in my mind,

22:23.360 --> 22:26.480
it just didn't make sense. I was like, the business owner has no skin in the game.

22:27.440 --> 22:33.040
Why would the business owner, if I send them leads, why would they be incentivized to even

22:33.040 --> 22:37.040
answer my leads? If they have my lead or they have their lead, they're for sure going to take their

22:37.040 --> 22:42.240
lead because they're going to make the full rip on their lead and not on mine. Right. So why would

22:42.240 --> 22:48.080
they even do it on top of that? Why would they, why would they be honest? Why like what's in it?

22:48.080 --> 22:51.520
What's in it for them to be honest? And then I'm like, even if they are, I'm going to go and check

22:51.520 --> 22:57.040
all this. So I always knew commission was not a good idea, but here's where I made the mistake

22:57.040 --> 23:05.440
is I thought that the best, what's the correct term? The best deal structure was the paper lead

23:05.440 --> 23:11.840
model. And the reason why is because in my mind, I was like, all right, I'm always the person that

23:11.840 --> 23:15.840
will bet on themselves. I'll always be the one that if you give me the option and say, Hey,

23:15.840 --> 23:20.720
I'll give you this guaranteed amount of money, right? Let's say that you're offering me a job

23:20.720 --> 23:26.640
or whatever. And you say, Hey, Nick, I'll either give you this guaranteed amount of money or I'll

23:26.640 --> 23:32.080
give you a commission based on your performance. I'm always going to take the commission based on

23:32.080 --> 23:36.320
performance. I'm always going to take the one that that's betting on myself. And so I took that same

23:36.320 --> 23:43.120
logic into this business. But I, what I didn't realize guys is that a paper lead model is never

23:43.120 --> 23:47.120
going to be based on your performance. You think it is. And on paper, a paper lead model would be

23:47.120 --> 23:53.760
this. Aaron is the tree service owner and Aaron is going to pay me for exactly how many leads I

23:53.760 --> 23:59.680
send him. Sounds amazing, right? Because it sounds like, Hey, if I just go and I get my SEO ranked

23:59.680 --> 24:04.640
or I get my SEO dialed, I get my website ranked for these extra keywords and I can add another,

24:04.640 --> 24:08.800
you know, another five leads per month at a hundred bucks a rip, that's an extra $500.

24:09.680 --> 24:14.240
That's on me. I can make an extra 500 bucks this month, right? It sounds amazing. It sounds like

24:14.240 --> 24:20.080
there's no ceiling. It sounds like the holy grail of holy grails. But what you don't think about guys

24:20.720 --> 24:25.920
is that these business owners have limits. These business owners don't all think big. These

24:25.920 --> 24:30.880
business owners, when you hit a certain number of leads, they start to freak out. When their bill

24:30.880 --> 24:36.400
starts to get to a certain amount of money, they start to freak out. They don't have the ability

24:36.400 --> 24:41.520
to expand that quickly. They don't have the mind to think that big. And so what ends up happening

24:41.520 --> 24:46.080
is you end up getting to this threshold that you don't even know about. And there will be a month

24:46.080 --> 24:51.680
that happens. And, you know, I mean, here's the exact what happened to me is I got, I had this deal

24:51.680 --> 24:56.560
and we were doing a hundred dollars per lead. Okay. Business owner was cool. We had this really good

24:56.560 --> 25:01.600
arrangement. He was good at closing. And he was, you know, we started and it was like roughly

25:01.600 --> 25:06.400
around a thousand bucks, getting about 10 leads per month. And he was cool. And we were doing that

25:06.400 --> 25:09.920
and we're doing that and we're doing that. And then all of a sudden my SEO, like one month,

25:09.920 --> 25:12.960
it just kind of clicked. I wasn't running ads. I wasn't doing any of that, but everything just

25:12.960 --> 25:18.160
kind of worked. It was either that or the weather or something happened. But my leads like tripled

25:18.160 --> 25:22.960
in a month. And that invoice that I send him every single month for a thousand bucks, I sent him an

25:22.960 --> 25:29.920
invoice. It was like three grand. And not only did he not pay it, but he went through and he wanted

25:29.920 --> 25:36.560
to know the name, you know, he wanted to double check. Was each lead, you know, were they actually

25:36.560 --> 25:42.240
somebody that he could service? Was it exactly in his service area? Did they answer the phone

25:42.240 --> 25:47.920
on the first try? Did they go, like when they went to the house, were they, all these things that I

25:47.920 --> 25:53.840
couldn't control, right? To the point where he was trying to get me to take leads, billable leads

25:53.840 --> 26:02.240
off of this invoice because he would tell them, hey, I'm backed out, you know, two months on work

26:03.120 --> 26:06.480
and they, he would lose, they wouldn't even want an estimate. And then he would say, well, that's

26:06.480 --> 26:10.880
not, I don't want that lead. I'm like, bro, that's your business. You need to hire more people. You

26:10.880 --> 26:15.520
need to be more efficient. That's not me. And, you know, we kind of came to a middle ground,

26:15.520 --> 26:20.640
but it just, I tarnished the relationship. So what you don't realize about paper lead guys,

26:20.640 --> 26:23.200
is there is a threshold for all business owners. And when they hit it,

26:24.720 --> 26:31.040
you may not even know just, just for the record. Hold on one second. Okay. You may not even know,

26:31.040 --> 26:35.040
but you will, at the end of the month, they will let you know. And it's, it's just a pain.

26:35.040 --> 26:40.240
Not only that guys, you have to calculate the, you know, okay, how much is it per lead

26:40.240 --> 26:46.160
and how many leads did we send? Go ahead and get 10, 15 clients guys. And you're,

26:46.160 --> 26:52.240
you literally have to hire, I had to hire somebody to calculate those. And then they're a human and

26:52.240 --> 26:56.960
then they're making mistakes. So then I went and I had a software guy build me a software from the

26:56.960 --> 27:02.800
ground up that every lead, it would scrape the email. It would dump it into a glorified

27:02.800 --> 27:08.240
Google sheet. Then it would calculate the cost per lead. And then it would link with QuickBooks

27:08.240 --> 27:13.760
and it would send them an invoice. Dude, it was such a pain. And that was with software. Okay.

27:14.720 --> 27:19.680
On top of that guys, how do you define a lead? What if it's a good lead, but the business owner

27:19.680 --> 27:25.120
doesn't answer? Whose fault is that? Is that your fault? Is that their fault? What if it's somebody

27:25.120 --> 27:29.040
that calls in, they're interested today, but then they cancel the appointment before the appointment?

27:29.040 --> 27:35.600
Who pays for that? You or them? And there's all these variables. And so what I didn't realize

27:35.600 --> 27:39.840
is all these variables. I also didn't realize that when people didn't close jobs, they would blame me.

27:40.480 --> 27:46.160
Okay. And I had one guy, I mean, I've got stories for days, but I have one guy in a North, the

27:46.160 --> 27:51.200
Northwest corner of the, of the U S I think it was in Seattle or it was either Seattle or Portland.

27:51.200 --> 27:59.120
And this guy, he owed us like 10, 15,000 bucks. And we kept hounding them, hounding them, hounding

27:59.120 --> 28:04.720
them. This is for, you know, 150 leads roughly. And which is another mistake that I made of not

28:04.720 --> 28:10.080
collecting quicker, quick enough. But basically they called us one day, they had their mother-in-law

28:10.080 --> 28:16.560
or something call us. I was like, Hey, the situation happened. The partner got arrested for this.

28:16.560 --> 28:21.520
We're closing down the business and filing bankrupts. And sure enough, they did. We took

28:21.520 --> 28:25.760
them to, you know, we sent them to collections and everything. We got the notice in the mail

28:25.760 --> 28:31.520
that said they, you know, they went bankrupt. These are all things that happen because of

28:31.520 --> 28:36.320
paper lead. So that said, guys, the Holy grail of Holy grails, the only way you should be doing

28:36.320 --> 28:41.760
business is flat V deals. Don't be doing commission deals. Don't be doing paper lead deals. Don't be

28:41.760 --> 28:49.680
doing, you know, a hybrid deal. The only scalable way to do it, predictable way to do it is a flat

28:49.680 --> 28:53.760
V deal. Yes, on some of these deals, you're going to take a little bit less money, but you know what?

28:53.760 --> 28:58.480
You can get the money. You can charge per week, charge per month, set it and forget it,

28:58.480 --> 29:02.080
set expectations. Hey, Mr. Business Owner, some months are going to be better. Some months are

29:02.080 --> 29:08.240
going to be worse. This is the amount. If we can double or triple what you spend as your ROI or as

29:08.240 --> 29:12.480
the money that's coming back in, you have a great ROI. We'll keep working together. The only way I

29:12.480 --> 29:18.480
was able to scale is when I switched to flat V deals. So do not make the mistake of doing paper

29:18.480 --> 29:21.360
lead. And some of you guys might even be on this call right now going, well, I've got a deal. It's

29:21.360 --> 29:26.640
paper lead. That's great. You have one deal. Okay. Go and scale that thing. Go get 30 clients with

29:26.640 --> 29:30.480
the paper lead deal. And you go ahead and let me know how that goes. Cause I've tried it and it's,

29:30.480 --> 29:35.600
it's, it's, it's bad. Okay. It's really bad. Okay. That's number two. Number one, not having my due

29:35.600 --> 29:40.480
diligence style. Number two, not, sorry, doing paper lead instead of flat feet. Number three,

29:42.000 --> 29:47.440
was obsessing over obscure niches instead of just sticking with the boring ones.

29:48.320 --> 29:54.560
I heard this phrase so many times I could just go blue in the face saying it, but the riches are in

29:54.560 --> 29:59.680
the niches. The riches are in the niches. The riches are in the niches. And of course, from the

29:59.680 --> 30:03.520
people that weren't actually doing the model, they were just selling the program. They were just

30:03.520 --> 30:07.200
selling the tools. They were just selling the hosting, all this different stuff. And the more

30:07.200 --> 30:11.120
that I built the blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Like, of course you're telling me the riches are

30:11.120 --> 30:14.480
in the niches because you want me to go build a website in a hundred different niches because

30:14.480 --> 30:20.240
a hundred, a hundred hosting plans is great money for you. Okay. I don't make my money selling

30:20.240 --> 30:25.440
hosting. I don't sell a white labeled platform. I don't sell done for you services, that kind of

30:25.440 --> 30:30.480
stuff. So it benefits me nothing for you guys to go and build a bunch of websites. If anything,

30:30.480 --> 30:33.920
it hurts me because then you guys are going to get discouraged and want to get out of the model.

30:33.920 --> 30:41.600
Okay. So guys do not think that you can't make money in boring niches. Yes, there is money in

30:42.560 --> 30:48.000
there. There's riches in niches for sure. There's riches in obscure niches, but it's not the only

30:48.000 --> 30:54.320
way to make money. Okay. And the more predictable way to make money is to make money in the boring

30:54.320 --> 31:00.080
niches first. And then you can start to, and I would, I would kind of like liken this to just

31:00.080 --> 31:04.240
business in general, right? Let's say I want to start a business and I want to get rich,

31:04.240 --> 31:09.040
which everybody does. I can have two strains of thought, right? I get two schools of thought.

31:09.040 --> 31:15.200
Number one is I can do, there's riches in niches and I can sit there for 10 years trying to find

31:15.200 --> 31:20.880
this business. That's just this, this niche business that no one's ever thought of. You know,

31:21.280 --> 31:25.760
for example, one of my buddies, he, I don't know, maybe they're going to kill it, but he's like,

31:25.760 --> 31:29.840
he hit me up one day and I'm like, what are you up to? He's like, dude, we've got this thing,

31:29.840 --> 31:34.400
we're pitching on Shark Tank. I'm like, sick, dude. What is it? And this is one of those like,

31:34.400 --> 31:39.120
always starting a new business kind of guy. He's like, it's a fan that you attach the top of a

31:39.120 --> 31:47.120
porta potty. And I was like, cool, bro. Like, and again, this probably is a need, whatever,

31:47.920 --> 31:53.200
but you got to know the guy to realize it's like, he's, he's spent now, he's, he's older than me.

31:53.200 --> 32:00.080
He's probably spent 15 years now trying to think of the, the obscure niche, the obscure business

32:00.080 --> 32:05.120
that's going to make him millions of dollars. And me, I went and I said, okay, what's a business

32:05.120 --> 32:10.400
model that's tried and true? Rank and rent. Sounds good. Somebody else figured out, let me buy their

32:10.400 --> 32:13.920
program. Boom, boom, boom. Yeah, I had to figure some stuff out, but that's a tried and true

32:13.920 --> 32:19.680
business model. I did it. It didn't start off crazy, but I've now made millions and millions

32:19.680 --> 32:24.160
of dollars. And now I have the confidence and I've looked at other opportunities. I see other

32:24.160 --> 32:30.320
opportunities within this space even to go and I can go and, and now that I have the money coming

32:30.320 --> 32:37.520
in, now that I'm, you know, secure financially, I can go and sit back and take my time and say,

32:37.600 --> 32:44.000
huh, I wonder about that. I wonder about that. So my, my advice to anyone with business and,

32:44.000 --> 32:50.880
and even, and for sure within this business is don't worry about being so obscure. Do the tried

32:50.880 --> 32:56.400
and true until you get to a comfortable spot. Once you get to a spot where your bills are paid,

32:56.400 --> 33:02.080
plus some, plus a lot, now you can sit back and you can start to take some moves that aren't going

33:02.080 --> 33:06.640
to kill you, that aren't going to put you, set you back. Okay. So with this business,

33:06.640 --> 33:12.800
go into the tried and true, go into the fencing, go into the masonry, go into the, the, the spray

33:12.800 --> 33:17.040
foam installation, go into the, go into the stuff that everybody is telling you they're getting deals

33:17.040 --> 33:21.840
in. Okay. That I'm telling you, I'm showing you live examples that I'm getting deals in.

33:21.840 --> 33:26.880
And then once you get your bills paid, once you get out of the rat race, once you get to a certain

33:26.880 --> 33:32.960
level, then you can start to look at, oh, let's try doing the, the yacht rentals or the yacht

33:32.960 --> 33:36.880
charters, whatever, right? Something that's obscure like that. Let's see if this will work

33:36.880 --> 33:42.800
with private jet companies, which is, you know, probably going to be an entirely different type.

33:42.800 --> 33:48.560
Anyway, I sat and I was so obsessed with richer than the riches, richer than the riches. I started

33:48.560 --> 33:54.320
building in every single niche. I spent so much time looking at different ideas. What about this?

33:54.320 --> 33:59.200
What about this? Then guys, I had to go in and not only did I, I didn't know if the niche was

33:59.200 --> 34:03.360
going to work because I'd never heard of anyone doing it, but then I also didn't know if the city

34:03.360 --> 34:09.840
was going to work. So I had two variables that could kill me. So go into the tried and true,

34:09.840 --> 34:14.080
go into the boring, get to your, you know, revenue point where you're comfortable,

34:14.080 --> 34:18.720
and then you can worry about that. So the third thing that, that really cost me a lot of money,

34:18.720 --> 34:22.560
cost me hundreds of thousands of dollars was obsessing over obscure niches. You don't need

34:22.560 --> 34:29.120
to do it. It's, it's, it's not necessary. Okay. Number four, I got two more. I'll go through these

34:29.120 --> 34:35.120
in about five minutes and we'll do some Q and A. Number four is not, this is the fourth thing

34:35.120 --> 34:40.800
that cost me hundreds of thousands of dollars was not taking people's advice that had been there,

34:40.800 --> 34:46.080
done that. And instead taking advice from people who had not been there and done that. Okay. Now

34:46.080 --> 34:51.280
the reason I phrase it like that, which is kind of hard to even follow was I would have loved to

34:51.280 --> 34:55.040
take someone's advice that had been there, done that. I would have loved to take someone's advice

34:55.040 --> 35:01.280
that had made a hundred thousand dollars per month or had made $50,000 per month, or for heaven's

35:01.280 --> 35:07.440
sake that had made $35,000 per month. But the person that I knew that had made the most amount

35:07.440 --> 35:12.160
of money doing this, that the most they had made in a single month was like 20,000, 25,000 bucks.

35:12.160 --> 35:16.320
And they weren't even in the game anymore. So it wasn't even credible. So I couldn't go to that

35:16.320 --> 35:19.600
person and say, Hey, what do you think about this? What do you think about this update? What do you

35:19.600 --> 35:23.440
think about this thing that Google's doing? What do you think about this? I couldn't, you know,

35:23.440 --> 35:30.160
I did. And they were giving me their advice, but the advice was not correct or it wasn't up to date.

35:30.160 --> 35:35.440
Okay. And some of you guys, I'm not pointing fingers and hopefully not all of you guys,

35:35.440 --> 35:40.800
but I know some of you guys are taking advice from anyone and everyone. And that's the problem.

35:40.800 --> 35:45.600
And I see this in the free group and I try to kill it as soon as possible, but I see all the time,

35:45.600 --> 35:53.200
like, Hey, I got this landing page that it converts like crazy. DM me if you want it. First of all,

35:53.200 --> 35:58.720
they're soliciting. I kick them out immediately. Second of all, I want to be like, Hey, before

35:58.720 --> 36:02.880
you're allowed to post something like that, I want to see your Stripe account. I want to see,

36:02.880 --> 36:06.320
you know, how much money you've made. I want to see your contracts. I want to see how long you've

36:06.320 --> 36:10.960
been doing this. I want to see if you actually know what you're talking about. Okay. So guys,

36:10.960 --> 36:14.800
you have to be, there's so much free information out there. There's so many people talking about

36:14.800 --> 36:23.440
this. I know a couple of guys that live in the same city as me. Okay. These guys have never even

36:23.440 --> 36:30.240
done rank and rent. And I know like, dude, they, I know this because they told me. They told me,

36:30.240 --> 36:34.640
they bought a rank and rent program. They're like, yeah, we did use some of the SEO tactics

36:34.640 --> 36:39.200
for our business. They were doing some solar sales. They're like solar bros. And then they

36:39.200 --> 36:44.480
just decided to start a program and they're out there hawking a program for like 5,000 bucks.

36:44.480 --> 36:49.840
And they've never even done it. So the question you guys need to ask every single time you're

36:49.840 --> 36:56.320
going to take advice is, you know, what have you done in this business model exactly like this?

36:56.320 --> 37:00.960
Not, not what have you made selling the course? Not what have you made selling a tool? Not what

37:00.960 --> 37:07.680
have you made on social media? How much have you made doing rank and rent? Okay. That like period.

37:07.680 --> 37:11.920
How much are you making now? Are you still in the game or did you check yourself out? Okay.

37:12.880 --> 37:17.600
I can't stress this enough. It's whenever we use these examples of like the gym, the gym analogy,

37:17.600 --> 37:23.520
like, of course, if you wanted to get, you know, in, in crazy good shape and get a six pack and

37:23.520 --> 37:29.680
look chiseled, you know, you wouldn't go to somebody who doesn't, right? To put it nicely,

37:29.680 --> 37:34.320
you wouldn't go. But, and that's obvious, right? Of course, when you're getting, you know, you're

37:34.320 --> 37:38.480
going to go to somebody to, to manage your money, you wouldn't go to somebody that's completely

37:38.560 --> 37:43.600
broke, right? And those things make sense to us. But for some reason, when it comes to this,

37:43.600 --> 37:48.560
we don't even think about that. I'm not taking advice. There was this, there was this clip I

37:48.560 --> 37:54.640
put on my Instagram. If you guys aren't following me there, I post a lot of rank and rent stuff.

37:54.640 --> 37:59.760
You can follow me. It's at digital drug dealing is the handle. But I put this clip. It was Kanye

37:59.760 --> 38:06.320
and Piers. Piers Morgan, I think is his name. And Kanye is like, Piers, how much money are you worth

38:06.320 --> 38:10.320
or how much money do you make? And Piers is like, well, not as much as you. And Kanye is like,

38:10.320 --> 38:15.920
well, then why should I listen to you? And it was like, he was, it was being an ass, but it was

38:15.920 --> 38:19.600
funny. And it was really true because he's like, it's the truth. And Kanye is like, well, you

38:19.600 --> 38:23.920
should listen to me about money and maybe make more money, right? So whoever you're going to take

38:23.920 --> 38:30.720
advice from, that's your business. Just ask them. And even though I knew that inherently, and by the

38:30.720 --> 38:34.160
way, just because they're making a little bit more than you, doesn't mean you should necessarily

38:34.160 --> 38:39.440
follow what they're doing. Look at where you want to end up and don't take advice from anyone,

38:39.440 --> 38:44.080
except for the people that are there. If you're looking to make at least $100,000 per month,

38:44.080 --> 38:47.840
then you're going to have a very select group of people you're going to take advice from. Because

38:47.840 --> 38:52.880
to get to 25K is a completely different thing than getting to 100K. And you're going to build

38:52.880 --> 38:57.040
your business differently. You're going to scale differently. You're going to do all kinds of

38:57.040 --> 39:01.280
different stuff differently. And in order to get 25K, the same thing that gets you to 25K is not

39:01.280 --> 39:05.360
going to get you to 100K. So look at where you want to go eventually, where you want to end up,

39:05.360 --> 39:10.720
and only take advice from people that are there. Okay? Here's my last thing that cost me. And this

39:10.720 --> 39:15.920
was probably, if I were to give priority to any of them, if I were to say this is the most important

39:15.920 --> 39:19.520
one, this is going to be the most, you guys are going to think I'm just saying this to be catchy,

39:20.080 --> 39:25.360
but this is the advice that I heard. And it changed everything for me. It was at the perfect time.

39:25.360 --> 39:31.520
And it was just great advice. And that is the thing that cost me so much money

39:32.720 --> 39:38.640
was me being too smart. Okay? Me being too smart. Now, let me explain that. That doesn't mean that

39:38.640 --> 39:42.960
I have like a super high IQ and it's like, oh my gosh, I can't believe my parents gave me such good

39:42.960 --> 39:50.160
genes. No, I've never been accused. I've never been accused of being super too smart. Okay?

39:50.160 --> 39:55.600
What I mean by that is being too smart. And I knew that this was working. I knew that something

39:55.600 --> 40:03.760
was working and I was too smart to just do it again. Right? Instead of just being simple

40:03.760 --> 40:09.120
and basic and saying, hey, this worked, let me just do it again and again and again and again.

40:09.120 --> 40:16.160
I got too smart. I thought, well, you know what? Let me try and do, you know, it worked. That worked.

40:16.160 --> 40:21.760
But why, you know, let me do this. Or, you know, I got a deal for $700 per month, my very first

40:21.760 --> 40:29.280
deal. And it was a flat fee deal, actually. The irony is that my very first deal, guys, was a

40:29.280 --> 40:33.440
flat fee deal. It was in the wrong niche. It was in towing. But it was a flat fee deal for 700 bucks

40:33.440 --> 40:39.760
a month. And guess what I did on my next deal? A paperly deal. Right? I had the deal. It was working.

40:39.840 --> 40:47.440
But let me be too smart. And I started getting too smart. Right? I started saying too much. I

40:47.440 --> 40:51.840
started going into too many niches. I started offering too many services. I started thinking,

40:51.840 --> 40:56.000
you know, I was too smart. And then I heard this advice. Somebody said to me,

40:57.760 --> 41:05.760
if you've gotten a deal for $1,000 a month, why haven't you done that 100 times?

41:06.560 --> 41:13.920
And it was such a simple thing that they said. And I was like, yeah, why haven't I? And I have

41:13.920 --> 41:19.760
gotten a deal for $1,000 a month. So why don't I just get rid of everything else and just go get

41:19.760 --> 41:26.400
100 of those? And that was a very great moment for me because I just like, it clicked. I was like,

41:26.400 --> 41:31.120
I'm being too smart. I need to simplify. I need to be more basic. I need to be more simple.

41:31.120 --> 41:36.240
I need to be more simple. John Wooden, baby. John Wooden, every single year,

41:36.240 --> 41:41.520
he talked about the fundamentals. He would talk about just the basic, basic, basic stuff.

41:42.160 --> 41:48.560
And that's because that's what wins basketball games. So in that same realm, a lot of times I

41:48.560 --> 41:54.080
see people get a deal or for those of you that are in my program, there's a couple of you guys

41:54.080 --> 42:01.040
that are in my program, the process is there. The recipe is there. The blueprint is there.

42:01.600 --> 42:06.960
Don't get too smart. I'm not saying that I'm the most genius in the world, but if it works,

42:06.960 --> 42:11.360
then why are we trying to change it? Once you get to your 10K, 15K, 20K,

42:11.360 --> 42:17.280
you want to go and try and flip the model on its head like I did? That's cool. But if you know that

42:17.280 --> 42:20.880
something's working, just do it until you get to a comfortable spot and then you can start worrying

42:20.880 --> 42:25.120
about it. So let me go through this again, guys. Here's the five things that have cost me hundreds

42:25.120 --> 42:29.280
of thousands of dollars, five mistakes. Number one is not having my due diligence dialed in.

42:29.280 --> 42:34.640
Number two is doing paper lead instead of flat fee. Number three is obsessing over obscure

42:34.640 --> 42:39.440
niches instead of just sticking with the boring ones. Number four is listening to the wrong people

42:39.440 --> 42:45.520
and not listening to the people that were at the place I wanted to be. In my defense, I didn't know

42:45.520 --> 42:51.680
anyone at that place. You guys do. You know somebody that's made at least $100,000 per month for

42:51.680 --> 42:56.560
years. So that's a good start. Okay. And if there's somebody that's made more than me,

42:56.560 --> 43:03.840
then go listen to them. Okay. And then number five, guys, is being too smart, not being simple.

43:03.840 --> 43:09.360
There is so much power in being simple. There is so much growth that happens in being simple.

43:10.240 --> 43:14.960
And that's in every area. I'll share this last example. And then if you guys have Q and I want

43:14.960 --> 43:18.640
you guys to start dropping, I'm going to have Aaron go through it. But guys, this is even true.

43:18.640 --> 43:22.080
I kind of went through this period where I simplified everything. I simplified my business.

43:22.880 --> 43:29.600
I'm constantly trying to do that, right? And this happened to me with fitness too. In early 2020,

43:29.600 --> 43:35.440
sorry, early 2022, I decided, you know what, I'm going to go, no, was it 2022? It was 2023,

43:35.440 --> 43:40.640
I'm sorry. I decided, you know, this is going to be the year. I was 31 or 32. I can't remember

43:40.640 --> 43:45.360
what it was. I can't remember, whatever. And I was like, I want to be in the best shape of my life.

43:45.360 --> 43:50.720
I want to be less than 10% body fat. I want to look like this, whatever. And so I went out and

43:50.720 --> 43:57.600
I was like, I'm going to find the person that has the body I want, that's my age, that doesn't do

43:57.600 --> 44:02.560
steroids, you know, all the things. I want to make sure that they were as close to me as possible.

44:02.560 --> 44:06.400
And I'm going to go and pay them. And I found the person. I went, I asked them how much they charge.

44:06.400 --> 44:11.280
I said 20 grand. They don't do this. They said usually, they usually just sell their program,

44:11.280 --> 44:16.320
but they'll do the one-on-one coaching. It's 20 grand. And I paid 20 grand for six Zoom calls.

44:16.320 --> 44:25.040
Okay. Anyway, long story short, the craziest part about that whole process is that it worked

44:25.040 --> 44:31.040
and it worked miraculously. And to this day, I've never been in better shape. And here's what's

44:31.040 --> 44:39.600
crazy. The training regimen that he gave me and the diet plan that he gave me and the entire

44:39.600 --> 44:44.560
schedule of everything that he gave me was so simple that I didn't believe him.

44:45.520 --> 44:51.280
I was working out since I was 18. I'd been working out six days a week doing different muscle groups,

44:51.280 --> 44:56.640
two muscles, one muscle, all kinds of different stuff, then doing cardio on the weekends. And

44:56.640 --> 45:00.560
he's like, dude, you need to lift three times a week. And on top of that, you're only going to

45:00.560 --> 45:05.840
lift five lifts on those three days. And I was like, there's no way I'm going to gain weight.

45:05.840 --> 45:11.920
He's like, okay, well then don't change anything. Follow this nutrition and do this. And I promise

45:12.000 --> 45:18.080
you guys it worked and it blew my freaking mind. It was like, I've had to put in less effort

45:18.080 --> 45:22.640
mentally and honestly physically than I ever have. When I do it, I do it as hard as I can.

45:22.640 --> 45:29.040
But it is very, my plan is so simple. I can text it to you like in this. The amount of workouts I

45:29.040 --> 45:35.280
do is so simple. I can do it with just a basic garage gym. Okay. That's the power and simplicity.

45:35.840 --> 45:41.200
All right, Aaron, do we have any questions? If not, then we don't have to go spending more time.

45:41.200 --> 45:47.520
If Aaron, is he still on? Yes. So we have so far one question and this is coming from

45:47.520 --> 45:51.200
Kirk, Kirk Dahlstrom. And so he actually just joined a few days ago.

45:52.960 --> 45:58.240
Mr. China, Mr. Chinese living in China, which is crazy. Yeah, so cool. I think our first

45:58.240 --> 46:03.600
Chinese resident. Anyway, but he this he's obviously a newbie because this is a pretty

46:03.600 --> 46:08.160
basic question we can go over found a great city, but I'm finding another R&R site in the city,

46:08.160 --> 46:12.560
big volume and low CPC, go for it and move on. So it's the all what I do. Yeah, go ahead and

46:12.560 --> 46:17.520
answer Aaron. You know, these here's what's funny about Aaron, guys. If you ever see Aaron post in

46:17.520 --> 46:23.760
the group, you can I'm going to put my stamp on it that you can just follow his advice. Now, number

46:23.760 --> 46:28.960
one, because he's getting deals, he's got deals. Number two, because he and I talk so much that

46:28.960 --> 46:33.600
when he answers a question, it's exactly how I would answer it. Like, he'll he'll be like,

46:33.600 --> 46:38.800
Hey, let's do this. I'll give him an idea for live. He'll give me a title. It's almost exactly

46:38.800 --> 46:43.200
how we do it. So I already know this answer, Aaron, I'm just gonna have you do it because I

46:43.200 --> 46:47.200
know you're gonna get the exact answer. Yeah, so pretty basic answer. Nick talks about it all the

46:47.200 --> 46:51.200
time. It's a great question. The bottom line is Kurt is that it doesn't matter how many lead

46:51.200 --> 46:55.280
generators are in there. It just always comes down to the numbers, right? And so the more lead

46:55.280 --> 46:59.440
generators that are in there, sure, theoretically, the more competitive it will be. But there could

46:59.440 --> 47:03.680
be a hundred lead generators in there. The main things that we're looking at is the search volume,

47:03.680 --> 47:09.040
the CPC, and then also the and then that's mainly for the ad portion. And then the SEO portion

47:09.040 --> 47:13.200
is when we look at the backlinks of the content in the age of the domain, right? Those are the

47:13.200 --> 47:17.120
main and obviously, we have criteria for that it's in the program, you know, but those are the main

47:17.120 --> 47:22.000
things we look at. So it could be zero could be 100. Don't treat them like they're all local

47:22.000 --> 47:27.600
business. Let me this let me do this really quick. I'm going to show you this, Kurt, I'm going to

47:27.600 --> 47:32.640
just give you a quick example. I think I can share my screen. Okay, yes. Beautiful. You guys

47:32.640 --> 47:38.560
can see my screen, right? Yeah. Okay, this is when my whole my whole world changed on this on this

47:38.560 --> 47:45.840
idea is I was looking at this specific city. I love how people are just joining the thing. It's

47:45.840 --> 47:52.320
like, dog, you're you're you're a day late, a dollar short here. Okay. Okay, so I live in St.

47:52.320 --> 47:56.320
George, Utah. And I was like, you know what, this is when I was trying to simplify whatever.

47:56.880 --> 48:04.560
So I searched this, and I started doing my my due diligence. And I saw this website right here.

48:04.560 --> 48:09.040
Okay, I think this is it. No, that's not it. Which one did I see? I think it's down further.

48:10.160 --> 48:14.960
Where is it? This is hilarious. Okay, it's not even here. That's even better. Okay, so this

48:14.960 --> 48:20.960
would be a better example. So I go and do my research. And I see this website, it's like just

48:20.960 --> 48:26.640
the basic tree service st george.com. Or no St. George tree service.com. And I was like,

48:26.640 --> 48:31.520
you Kurt, I was like, gosh dang, I missed it. It's on my own backyard, and all this stuff. And I

48:31.520 --> 48:36.640
went I and I was so ticked about it, because everything looked good. Except for there was

48:36.640 --> 48:40.400
another lead generator. I was like, dang it, somebody already came here. So I went I did like

48:40.400 --> 48:46.400
the who is I found the name of the person on the website, I looked in my group and sure as sure

48:46.400 --> 48:51.040
enough, it was somebody in my group. So I went to my DMs, and I messaged it was a lady. I said,

48:51.040 --> 48:55.760
hey, oh, before that, guys, I called the website. And I was like, I made sure and sure enough,

48:55.760 --> 49:00.160
they didn't have a client. So number one, Kurt, don't assume they have a client. Most time,

49:00.160 --> 49:04.240
you got to realize people don't know how to sell the lead. Everyone thinks if you get leads,

49:04.240 --> 49:07.600
and you build a website, that's the that's the end all be all that's the beginning.

49:08.640 --> 49:13.040
The actual skill is selling it. So they didn't have a client. So I reached out and I said, hey,

49:14.000 --> 49:18.320
I'm in your group. I live in St. George. I would love to make an offer on your website. And I'd

49:18.320 --> 49:23.280
love to buy it from you. And she gave me like the most snarky, like snubbed response. And

49:24.080 --> 49:28.080
it really just kind of frustrated me and pissed me off. And that's what actually caused me like,

49:28.080 --> 49:32.080
you know, I let's game on. I didn't care if I lose money. I just want to put you out of business

49:32.080 --> 49:39.440
or whatever. I want to put you down of spot. And I went into this space and built this beautiful

49:39.440 --> 49:43.840
little website. I mean, this thing is killing it. Look at this. Look at the picture we chose

49:43.840 --> 49:50.480
for our background. We built this guy right here. And as you can see, I am number one here. I don't

49:50.480 --> 49:57.200
by the way, I don't even have a GMB. And we make 1000 bucks a month have been since 2020. I actually

49:57.200 --> 50:03.200
closed this deal on the hood of a car in a Maverick and a gas station parking lots called Maverick

50:04.160 --> 50:11.200
in 2020 during COVID and made 1000 bucks a month. And that's like from this no GMB. And I

50:11.200 --> 50:18.400
almost didn't go into the city. Okay, so and look, here's the irony. This the company, the website

50:18.400 --> 50:26.800
that I almost scared me off, nowhere to be found. They gave up. Okay, so if you look at it, and it's

50:26.800 --> 50:31.040
the metrics all make sense. Don't be afraid to go into it even if you see another lead generator.

50:31.040 --> 50:38.080
Okay, any other questions there? Yeah, we got a few. So well, yeah, Muneeb says, I mean, we can't

50:38.080 --> 50:42.080
listen. I'll let you respond to this. Can you list a couple of metrics to identify the perfect

50:42.080 --> 50:47.440
city niche combo? I think I might be overthinking it and crossing out some good ones. Yeah.

50:50.880 --> 50:54.960
Yeah, that's, that's a that's a that's not a loaded question. It's just a bit of a complex

50:54.960 --> 51:01.120
question with the time we have. I'm trying to think if made, I would direct you Muneeb,

51:01.120 --> 51:06.400
Nick had done a YouTube show last year in 2023 titled making hay with Dre. And you kind of had

51:06.400 --> 51:11.120
a live dedicated to each of the seven steps in the process. And so I'd look for those first couple.

51:11.760 --> 51:15.600
Yeah, that's a good place to start for sure. Obviously, those are that's like, that's like

51:15.600 --> 51:20.080
the secret. So that's like, that's what we teach, right? But if you want some ideas, and for time

51:20.080 --> 51:25.520
sake, go and look at the go to the YouTube channel, then go to lives and search it under

51:25.520 --> 51:31.120
there. Good call. Keep going. Yeah, for sure. Jaleel says, Where are you? Where are you in your

51:31.120 --> 51:35.840
agency? Where you are in your agency is motivation. Thanks for the advice. Where should someone be

51:35.840 --> 51:42.800
before they strictly focus on consulting? Consulting as in selling a program?

51:44.000 --> 51:49.360
I'm not exactly sure. Maybe it's time about legit consulting. Well, I'll say this. I don't know.

51:50.720 --> 51:57.200
Like consulting and like the the actual sense of like paying me for my advice. I don't do that.

51:57.200 --> 52:01.840
Like I've I will not I've never actually had anyone pay me where I've gotten on a call and

52:01.840 --> 52:06.960
gotten paid. So I just don't believe in trading my time for dollars. So the other option is to

52:06.960 --> 52:09.920
you know, package your information and sell it, which is what I'm doing right now, which is why

52:09.920 --> 52:15.840
I have digital landlords. Here's what I'll tell you. I didn't. Sorry, super quick, Jaleel, just

52:15.840 --> 52:19.760
clarified consulting with the person you have running the agency. So it sounds like outsourcing

52:19.760 --> 52:24.800
to a project manager. Okay, I was about to say if you're talking about doing a program, I made

52:24.800 --> 52:30.000
a million dollars two years in a row, and then I started talking about it. So that'd be a good

52:30.000 --> 52:33.520
spot to like start a program, which by the way, I got no beef with because if you have something

52:33.520 --> 52:36.960
that's different than what I'm offering, go do it. But just make sure you got the pot to piss in.

52:37.680 --> 52:46.320
Or I might wreck your life. I'm just kidding. So for me, I mean, as soon as possible, you want

52:46.320 --> 52:52.080
to remove yourself from the business as soon as possible. I was I couldn't let sales go. I was so

52:52.080 --> 52:59.440
I loved it so much. And it was a high for me that like I just love getting that deal. And honestly,

52:59.440 --> 53:04.560
I was finally able to let go of it when I started digital landlords and I would sell I would bring

53:04.560 --> 53:08.240
people into the program and I was like, Oh, I still get my fix, right. And then eventually,

53:08.240 --> 53:14.160
like I don't even do our sales for that anymore. But the truth is, as soon as possible, I would

53:14.160 --> 53:19.760
make sure you go through and do at least five websites end to end every single piece of the

53:19.760 --> 53:24.960
puzzle before you start outsourcing and then slowly start outsourcing all the pieces that make that

53:24.960 --> 53:30.000
move the needle the least the content, sorry, the things that caught take the most amount of time

53:30.000 --> 53:35.200
that move the needle the least building the website, you know, setting up the on page SEO,

53:35.200 --> 53:40.880
whatever the stuff that's very, very, like just a formula, and then moving all the way up to sales

53:40.880 --> 53:44.800
and sales was is the thing I would get rid of last but you do it as soon as possible, obviously,

53:44.800 --> 53:48.640
then you can go and you can focus on more strategic stuff, you can focus on bigger deals,

53:48.640 --> 53:53.520
like right now, the only time I get involved in a deal is if it's a big deal. And so like,

53:53.520 --> 54:00.160
for example, we did a proposal for 7500 or 10,000 per month was our options, we gave them,

54:00.160 --> 54:04.880
and I got a little bit involved in that deal, because it's like, okay, that's 100 plus $1,000

54:04.880 --> 54:08.000
per year, per year, that actually is gonna, you know, make a little bit of a dent.

54:09.760 --> 54:14.320
Yeah, for sure. I mean, yeah, I mean, I suppose most of us have read Rich Dad Poor Dad and

54:14.320 --> 54:19.600
Kiyosaki talks about until the business can run without you, you still just have a job, right.

54:19.680 --> 54:23.600
And so the goal should be how can the business run without that's at least

54:23.600 --> 54:28.080
my long term trajectory. So Shane says, thanks, guys, as always have to hop have an awesome week.

54:28.080 --> 54:32.160
Thanks, Shane. It's always great to have you. And then last question, Julian says,

54:32.160 --> 54:35.440
what's the best sales book you would advise me to read for R&R and why?

54:39.360 --> 54:45.520
Best sales book I would read would be The Psychology of Selling by Tracy.

54:46.000 --> 54:51.360
Very simple, very basic, but I've read that book, I don't know, three, four times. That's a really

54:51.360 --> 54:55.680
solid book. Don't try to listen to it on audio. You will fall asleep, because the guy has like one

54:55.680 --> 55:00.480
of those like very soothing voices, and it's just like whatever, but that's a really solid book.

55:00.480 --> 55:06.800
I read that book every year when I did sales door to door, and I read it again as a lead generator,

55:06.800 --> 55:14.320
as a digital real estate investor, Aaron. Guys, we're going to end it here. Again,

55:14.320 --> 55:18.480
we're going to end it here. Again, as a reminder, if you guys have not already,

55:18.480 --> 55:22.400
this is I'm going to show you guys. I'm so pumped about this. This is the thing I was

55:22.400 --> 55:25.840
talking about earlier. It's called Rank and Rent Engine, but make sure to hit me up first,

55:25.840 --> 55:31.680
because we're doing a beta before you just go and start paying for it. There's a free thing,

55:31.680 --> 55:36.320
but if you want to get like a discounted thing, this is where I'm running my entire agency.

55:37.440 --> 55:42.080
Send me a message, and I'll send you some information on this. I'm doing my due diligence.

55:42.080 --> 55:47.200
I'm tracking my clients. I'm doing my search volume. Every single piece of it is inside of

55:47.200 --> 55:52.640
that. You can buy your tracking numbers, and I'm finally able to say, hey, this is a tool that I

55:52.640 --> 55:57.440
can endorse. Super pumped about that. Then who was it that was asking about, I think it was Shane.

55:57.440 --> 56:01.920
He already hopped off. Was that Shane Noble? Who hopped off? Shane Noble? Yeah. Okay. There's

56:01.920 --> 56:05.840
another Shane on here that was talking about something about, yeah, Shane Coogan. Shane,

56:05.840 --> 56:12.880
the other Shane, message me. Let's talk. Cool? Awesome. Okay. Awesome, guys. Appreciate you

56:12.880 --> 56:18.160
being on. We'll see you guys in the free group. I might be going live later this week. Until then,

56:18.160 --> 56:34.000
happy hunting. Let's go get some deals. See you guys.
