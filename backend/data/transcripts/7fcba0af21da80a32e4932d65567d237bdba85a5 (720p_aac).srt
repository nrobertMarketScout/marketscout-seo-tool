1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,540
So Bruce had found a city niche combo that looks great,

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:04,780
but only found six businesses advertising in the area.

3
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:06,620
Is this still a go or move on?

4
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:11,920
Six businesses, I'd still go for it.

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,900
I mean, if you are, it shouldn't,

6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,220
I mean, look, I've gone into cities

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,820
that there's been three or two and I've gotten deals.

8
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,620
What we have to remember guys,

9
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,700
is it is still possible to close people

10
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,300
that aren't currently paying for ads or leads.

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,980
That's still a thing, right?

12
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,480
Like I feel like before I started talking about it,

13
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,720
people weren't even looking at that shit.

14
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,700
It was just like, we're just going into whatever.

15
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,300
So yes, you can close people that aren't paying.

16
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,400
It's just easier when they're paying for Google ads.

17
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,800
And then it's easier after that paying for people

18
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,800
that are paying, finding people that are paying

19
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,160
for home advisor and then Angie's leads.

20
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,440
And then it goes down, boom, boom, boom, boom.

21
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,480
So at six people paying for it, yeah, bro, send it.

22
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,920
No big deal, just send that thing, dude.

23
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,820
Gotta get in those reps.

24
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,900
And I'm guessing if there's not anyone paying for ads

25
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:59,400
or only six people, then maybe your CPC is really low.

26
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,800
And if nothing else, you get your reps in, okay?
