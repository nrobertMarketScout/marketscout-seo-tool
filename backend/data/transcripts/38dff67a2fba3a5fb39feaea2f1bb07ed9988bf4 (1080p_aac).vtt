How do we do this when we have 40 billion things going on?

00:02.560 --> 00:04.720
You need to prioritize, bro.

00:04.720 --> 00:07.000
Kenny, look at all the stuff you gotta do.

00:07.000 --> 00:08.800
Cause I know you got a job, I know you got kids,

00:08.800 --> 00:09.800
I know you got everything.

00:09.800 --> 00:13.280
What is the one thing that would move the needle

00:13.280 --> 00:14.120
towards your goal?

00:14.120 --> 00:15.680
First of all, you gotta have your goals, right?

00:15.680 --> 00:16.960
And I know you do.

00:16.960 --> 00:19.840
So you got your goals, and if your goal is 20K,

00:20.720 --> 00:22.680
what's the one thing you could do today

00:22.680 --> 00:24.880
that would get you closer to the goal?

00:24.880 --> 00:27.080
Go get a sale, okay?

00:27.080 --> 00:28.320
Is there something you need to do before

00:28.320 --> 00:29.360
you can go get a sale?

00:30.000 --> 00:31.800
You gotta hook the business owner, cool.

00:31.800 --> 00:34.000
Go hook the business owner, yes.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.680
When you have 40 billion things going on,

00:36.680 --> 00:37.800
what's the one thing that's gonna get you

00:37.800 --> 00:38.640
closer to the goal?

00:38.640 --> 00:40.600
It's by getting a damn client, okay?

00:40.600 --> 00:41.440
Go get a client.
