00:00.000 --> 00:03.420
["Take Me By Your Side"]

00:10.580 --> 00:12.820
Everyone has the same question,

00:12.820 --> 00:15.860
and they always ask, hey, what should I expect?

00:15.860 --> 00:17.740
Like, what's actually possible?

00:17.740 --> 00:19.460
If I come in this program, I go through it,

00:19.460 --> 00:21.020
like, what could I do?

00:21.020 --> 00:22.260
How much money could I make?

00:22.260 --> 00:24.420
How many deals could I get?

00:24.420 --> 00:26.060
Okay, and I will tell you right now

00:26.060 --> 00:29.020
that there are people in this program

00:29.020 --> 00:30.340
that have already done this,

00:30.340 --> 00:34.060
and in their first month, they have done eight deals.

00:34.060 --> 00:36.700
No kidding, we have a student that got in

00:36.700 --> 00:40.500
within 25 days, eight deals, okay?

00:40.500 --> 00:42.580
We also have a student that took a little bit longer.

00:42.580 --> 00:44.340
It took them five weeks to get a deal.

00:44.340 --> 00:49.340
They got a deal for $5,400 per month, one single deal, okay?

00:51.040 --> 00:55.620
So, the possibilities are great,

00:55.620 --> 00:57.580
but I wanna set expectations,

00:57.580 --> 01:00.420
just like you should with your clients, right?

01:00.420 --> 01:02.460
Just when the business owner says,

01:02.460 --> 01:05.440
hey, how many leads could I reasonably expect?

01:05.440 --> 01:06.620
You're not gonna go and tell them,

01:06.620 --> 01:09.460
hey, you know, I got this guy named Bob,

01:09.460 --> 01:11.740
and he has this site, and it's getting 100 leads.

01:11.740 --> 01:13.780
Cool, Bob has 100 leads,

01:13.780 --> 01:16.820
but if you set the expectation for 100 leads,

01:16.820 --> 01:19.900
you are going to be just dealing with a mess, okay?

01:19.900 --> 01:21.980
So, I wanna set the expectations right here,

01:21.980 --> 01:25.560
and the goal and the expectation is that within 30 days,

01:25.560 --> 01:28.280
you should at least have your first deal,

01:28.280 --> 01:30.220
and you need to realize, like,

01:30.220 --> 01:32.300
I need you to get your deal in 30 days,

01:32.300 --> 01:34.520
as bad as you need to get your deal in 30 days,

01:34.520 --> 01:36.560
because that's how I grow, and once you get your deal,

01:36.560 --> 01:37.720
I'm going to do an interview,

01:37.720 --> 01:40.120
that's gonna be more social proof,

01:40.120 --> 01:41.560
and that's just how this works.

01:41.560 --> 01:45.000
So, I am very, very invested in this, just like you are,

01:45.000 --> 01:46.720
because I need you to get deals,

01:46.720 --> 01:48.880
but I just wanna set the expectation that,

01:48.880 --> 01:50.520
I know some of you are gonna listen to that and go,

01:50.520 --> 01:52.360
oh, one deal, like, that's it?

01:52.360 --> 01:54.920
I got way bigger goals, that's cool,

01:54.920 --> 01:56.720
and I'm really cool with that,

01:56.720 --> 01:58.220
but here's what I understand,

01:58.220 --> 02:00.160
is the first deal is the most important.

02:00.160 --> 02:02.760
So, the goal is, and the expectation is,

02:02.760 --> 02:05.600
follow the training, go through the modules,

02:05.600 --> 02:07.780
do as I've instructed, okay?

02:07.780 --> 02:11.280
Go through them, each one, and do exactly what it asks.

02:11.280 --> 02:13.780
Don't just watch it, and then don't do anything.

02:13.780 --> 02:16.800
Do exactly what it asks you to do,

02:16.800 --> 02:18.740
and the expectation I have for you,

02:18.740 --> 02:19.700
and you should have for yourself,

02:19.700 --> 02:22.240
is that within 30 days, within the first month,

02:22.240 --> 02:26.020
you are getting your very first flat fee deal.
