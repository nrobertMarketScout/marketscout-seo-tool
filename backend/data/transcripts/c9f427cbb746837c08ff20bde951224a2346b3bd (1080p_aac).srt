00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
Hey everybody, Jeff here. We're doing some filming here to set up the new Google Ads.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,760
We're going to be doing search campaigns for now on. We're going to be setting this up to be a

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,640
website search with a call-out option. That's going to be the one that's going to give you the most

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:20,000
utility for most of your lead gens. Maybe at a future date we'll set up a call-only ad for

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,520
specific reasons, but today we're going to do website traffic with a call-out asset added.

6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:32,960
With that, we're going to go ahead and begin here. So I fold up my MCC here. We were going to set up

7
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,720
a new sub-account. You can see right here in sub-account. So when we pull up our MCC, we go down

8
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:45,040
here to settings, okay, and we pop that tab down right here and you can follow down along. It says

9
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:50,720
sub-account settings. You can see the sub-accounts right here and then I click the plus sign right

10
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:57,680
here and I go to create new account. Okay, so today for the training purposes, we're going to

11
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,560
go through, to follow along with the training, we're going to do Bentonville Concrete today.

12
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:11,120
So we're going to go ahead and set up an ad for Nick's Bentonville Concrete site. So I go here and

13
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:15,600
I set this up. I say Google Ads account. It's going to give you these two options. You want to choose

14
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,680
Google Ads account. We go down here and so for Arkansas, I want to choose their time. I believe

15
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:29,600
they're closer to Chicago time and currency. There you go and that's it. Click here

16
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:36,560
and confirm you're not a robot and save and continue. That would be the first step in setting

17
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:44,080
this up. This is going to ask me to confirm it's you. Sometimes they do that and there you go.

18
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:48,320
Looks like that was good to go. We'll go ahead and do that again. If that happens to you,

19
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:53,120
sometimes it just sends it to like your YouTube or to your Gmail. Not really a big issue.

20
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:04,720
Okay, so we have these things set here. This is your payment profile. You should already have this

21
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:10,400
set up. We've set that up for you in the training. If not, you can go up here to tools and training

22
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,400
or tools and settings and there is a billing area right here where you can

23
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:20,480
set that up under settings. I'm going to hit submit.

24
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,920
Okay, so with that, now it's going to bring me back into my sub accounts here.

25
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,120
You can see them right here and here is our new one Bentonville Concrete. We're going to click here

26
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,640
and it's going to it's thinking and it's going to come up and it's going to we're going to start

27
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:56,560
setting up our campaign. Okay, so it wants us to set up our new campaign right here. You can either

28
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,680
click the button right here that says new campaign or you can go down here to set up a campaign.

29
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,480
So I'm going to click right here and set up a campaign and then a lot of this should look

30
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,520
familiar with the initial training for the students that have been here for a little bit,

31
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,880
but if you're new, this is fine. This is just the new one that you're going to be getting.

32
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:19,120
For today's ad, we're going to be doing a website traffic ad with the call out added. So we're going

33
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,320
to click right here to website traffic and then here it's going to give us the different types

34
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:29,440
of campaigns. You can see all the ones that Google wants to give you or at least for options.

35
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,920
Google wants to give you or at least for options, we're going to select search.

36
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,720
Okay, and then we're going to do our website. So our website today is going to be Nick's

37
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,560
Bentonville Concrete. You guys should all be familiar with that through the training.

38
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,920
I think in the second version of training, we'll use Queen Creek Concrete, but these are the these

39
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,920
are going to be the same things. When it asks for your conversion goal, I just like to keep it simple

40
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:01,600
and do a page view. You don't need to set up conversion tracking at this point. This is fine.

41
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:06,240
So then it's going to ask you to name it. You can you can create whatever name you want.

42
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:19,600
I'm just going to do search ad Bentonville Concrete. Okay, when you go here, it's going to ask

43
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,680
on to turn on enhanced conversions. You can do that if you want. I don't because I don't like

44
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,840
to share everything with Google, but that's there's nothing wrong with leaving that selected

45
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:37,360
there. Okay, and then we're going to go to our next screen. Okay, so the next step in setting

46
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,640
this up, it's going to take you to the bidding, right. And so for bidding, its default is

47
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:49,200
conversions. I recommend and would tell you guys to go and do clicks rather than conversions.

48
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:55,840
When you start out a new campaign and you do conversions, it will Google will spend all of

49
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,640
your ad budget and sometimes up to three times your daily ad budget. So you want to start with

50
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:06,240
max clicks, especially for the first three or four months of an ad. So we're going to go here,

51
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:12,000
we're going to select clicks. Now the next step it's going to do is it's going to ask you

52
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:19,120
to set a maximum cost per click bid limit. You can see right here, it starts off as a default

53
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,560
where it doesn't ask you that. But while we're setting this up, we're going to go ahead and

54
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,720
we're going to click set right here. Okay. Now at this point, some of you are going to say, well,

55
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,160
I don't know what it is. And that's fine. So we're going to go to the next step,

56
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:36,640
which is using Google Keyword Planner to help set those CPCs. So with that, I want to show you guys,

57
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:42,560
some of you are using SEMrush. You can see here that I use Mangles. They're both great tools.

58
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,760
There's not really a huge difference between them. It's just that I use Ahrefs for a lot of

59
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:54,000
my SEO stuff and it doesn't work great for our local SEO. For Mangles, it's just a cheaper plan

60
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,400
and I like using it. It also gives me the ability to more easily search over certain cities for

61
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:07,120
keywords. So I go here. I type in my main keyword is concrete contractors over Bentonville. I get

62
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,360
good search volume and as you can see here, there's no CPC. But I'm not really worried about that

63
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,400
because I know that there are people running ads there. But it just gives me some seed words and

64
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:22,560
some other things to look at. Okay. From there, what I do is I get my main keywords. So we're

65
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,040
doing concrete contractors. We kind of know what those keywords are. But if you were running

66
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:34,160
artificial grass or spray foam or something like that, you want to have your base list of keywords.

67
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:39,440
And that's important in your initial keyword research with SEMrush or Mangles.

68
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:45,120
And I'm going to show you why that's important here. So we're back to our ad. We're going to

69
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,760
use Google Keyword Planner. Now, I don't want to lose my progress right here. So I'm going to go

70
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:55,600
to Tools and Settings. I'm going to click the wrench right here. You go all the way to the left

71
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:00,640
in the planning column. You go down to Keyword Planner. You want to right click and you want to

72
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:08,480
say open link and new tab. And you can see up here that it's open that right here. Okay. So I'm going

73
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:14,080
to say I want to you can see right here. It's got an active account. Okay. I'm going to click there

74
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:19,200
and it's going to ask me for what keywords I want to use. So for keywords that I want to use,

75
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:30,560
it's going to be concrete contractor. It's going to be concrete driveway, concrete patio.

76
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:39,520
We'll experiment with concrete company as well. Okay. So we're going to run those four keywords

77
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,920
for right now. You can run like four to six in here. It's not a huge thing. And then right here

78
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,840
where it's always going to have a default of whatever home country you're in. But right here

79
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,680
with the little old Google Maps sign, you want to click on where it says the United States.

80
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,720
And what we're going to do is we're going to deselect that and then we're going to choose

81
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:02,320
our location to target. Okay. Now this is not necessarily going to be our

82
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:10,800
this isn't necessarily going to be our main place to set up where we're going to run our ads at.

83
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,520
We'll get to that in a different step. This is just to set up and get an idea of what

84
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,880
the CPC will be for running ads over that location. So they're related but they're

85
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:24,960
separate things. So you can see here I have it selected. It's running it over Bentonville.

86
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:30,560
I could add other locations but it's really not important at this phase. We're just doing research

87
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:38,720
on CPC here. We go down to here and I say get results. Okay.

88
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,960
And here we go. So it's going to give us our our stuff here.

89
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:54,400
And this is interesting. We are getting no CPC here. Very interesting. Very limited CPC

90
00:08:54,400 --> 00:09:01,200
for Bentonville, Arkansas. Okay. So sometimes that's going to happen. When we have here we

91
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,720
have concrete contractor, concrete driveway, concrete patio, concrete company, concrete

92
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:12,640
patio, concrete company and then you have the added near me. We'll talk about this when we

93
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:18,240
set up our keywords later. Concrete repair. So there's a little bit of search volume but not a lot

94
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,840
which is interesting. I think you guys on Simrush are getting a lot more than what I'm seeing here

95
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:32,720
right now. But we can see that in concrete there's near me. You can see a low bid and you can see the

96
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:38,400
top of page high bid. Okay. So when you set up your main keywords you want to kind of scroll

97
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:44,080
through this column and you want to pick up your top of page range for your CPC.

98
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:53,680
And this in this case the top of page bid for the one keyword will be $11.45 which I know is higher

99
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,480
than what we recommend in the training but when you're running search campaigns you have the

100
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:04,480
ability to be more of a ninja and getting your ad displayed when people do different search queries.

101
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:10,160
So what we want to do is we want to go back to our campaign here and we're going to set that maximum

102
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:17,280
CPC limit. I like to do one penny ahead of what I see is the highest limit.

103
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:25,520
With that we will do another additional live at one point where we will discuss what to do when

104
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:32,320
you have a lot of variations between the top of page high bid. Okay so once I do that I'm going to

105
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:39,360
hit next. Okay guys so after we set our our CPC limit we go to this next phase which is the campaign

106
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:46,480
settings. This is a really simple thing but it also can be a little confusing and if you go through

107
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,800
too fast with this you can make a simple mistake. So we want to be just on the search network.

108
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,920
We can see right here Google auto fills these two blue check marks and one is for search partners.

109
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,000
We don't want to do that so we deselect that and the other one is their display network so we

110
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,720
deselect that. Now our ad is only going to run on the search network. Okay all right and now the

111
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:12,480
default location is always going to be the world. Okay so we we're going to hit enter another location

112
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,320
okay and then we're going to start typing in. You can either type in a city or in this case

113
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,840
because I'm familiar with Bentonville and how the how it's kind of that city's laid out.

114
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:32,240
We're going to do like a 15 mile radius and we're going to type in Bentonville Arkansas and we're

115
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,200
going to do a 15 mile radius. Okay and that's going to give us this really big area right here

116
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:42,240
and that's about what we're going to do for this ad setup. Okay now sometimes if there's a lot of

117
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:48,320
bigger cities around here you and this city is like 170 and just by doing this all of a sudden

118
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:53,600
now my ad's running to three or four or five hundred thousand people a 20 or 25 dollar a day

119
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,480
budget isn't going to do well. So you just have to make sure that you do your research on the not

120
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,200
only your keywords and your niche but also when you're setting up your ad. If this was a large

121
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,880
city with a lot of suburbs around it I would just do that city and that city only and you do that

122
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,840
right here by going into the location and you just type in that city and that's where you run it and

123
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:19,280
you'll see it on the map. Okay and to show an example of that we'll just do that right now we'll

124
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:23,360
just show you guys what that looks like that way if you're having that issue. So right here I'm

125
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,600
going to say I just want to go over the location and I hit target and you can see it just outlines

126
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,920
the city limits of Bentonville. Okay and then now here if I wanted to add in these other towns I

127
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:40,000
could definitely do that I can add in Bella Vista Arkansas it's right here right I can add that in

128
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,360
too if I want to do that okay but for simplicity we're just going to do a radius because I know

129
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:52,080
that's going to work here. Okay so we're going to do this we're going to change that to 15 miles

130
00:12:52,080 --> 00:13:02,880
and we're going to hit target. Okay so now we're back to there you can see the radius and now we're

131
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:09,200
going to hit save. Okay before we do anything else you want to go to location options right here

132
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,520
you're going to drop that down for the type of services that we're going to be focusing on for

133
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:21,200
lead gen we want to be presence and people in or regularly in your targeted locations okay

134
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:28,240
all right languages and typically in a default to english and keywords we'll get to there and

135
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,800
in more settings right here there's really nothing here this is where you can set up an

136
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,960
ad schedule if you want to set it up but typically in the very beginning we don't really do that we

137
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:41,600
don't really need to do that but you can get in here and set your ad schedule up later on

138
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:47,920
okay it's really simple you just hit the pencil button it'll give you the times all right we're

139
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:55,680
going to go to next okay so so now we're going to set up our keywords okay and this is going to

140
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:08,720
be at the ad group level okay so we're going to do and you can name these whatever you want but

141
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,680
this is just for me to keep track of this here's the website right here and you can see that they

142
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:22,160
wanted to give me a list of different keywords that they found okay i'm going to go up here

143
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:27,920
and you can see at the top of my screen here there's a website called adwordsrapper.com

144
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:35,040
okay it's free i don't think they try to sell your info or anything like that but what it does is it

145
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,680
help you format your your keywords you can see here if you want to read it you can see the different

146
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:46,080
types of keywords that are out there and there's different there's different quotes and and brackets

147
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:51,040
and other things to add and they all mean something when you load it into right here to your keyword

148
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:58,960
thing okay so we want to go here and we're going to add we're going to add our keywords so we go

149
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:06,080
here now our keywords are going to be concrete contractor okay we're going to do concrete

150
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:18,400
we're going to do concrete patio we're going to do let's see here we'll go back up to here

151
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,480
sorry i had to go back and get my thing so let me let me pull up some of the ones that

152
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,960
google's recommending right i can use some of these the near me you don't need to worry about

153
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,640
but maybe concrete repair will be one i want to use

154
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,560
okay and then another place besides google keyword planner to get ideas

155
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,360
is you can also go into your main goals or your simrush and you can look at the top

156
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:58,320
ones that you see here so we're going to do a concrete company we're going to type that in right

157
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:06,080
here and i'm also going to make that in plural

158
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,800
concrete pouring that might be one you want to look at so we'll look at that

159
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:23,040
concrete patio concrete driveway remember foundation and concrete pouring are different

160
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:28,320
okay they're going to be a different type of service then we can do residential and commercial

161
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:46,160
okay and once we have that again on these you can run eight to fifteen keywords just depends

162
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:52,560
on what you have and then you you get them to here i hit wrap keywords and then you see

163
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,760
it kind of refresh and then what i'm going to do is i'm going to scroll down here

164
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:02,960
and i'm looking at this box right here that says phrase match for whatever reason if you click this

165
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:08,320
button here it doesn't it doesn't want to copy it so i click inside the box here i select all

166
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:15,200
i copy and i go back to my search campaign where it says enter keywords i select all

167
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,720
i get rid of those and i add my own you can see the quotation so now i'm set up to run

168
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,240
a phrase match campaign

169
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:32,480
okay and now what we're going to do is now we're going to set up our headlines and we're going to

170
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:40,720
set up our descriptions okay this is going to be pretty much the same as the original training

171
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:48,400
but with the search campaign i get to add a lot more headlines and up to four different descriptions

172
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:54,080
okay so what i'm going to do just for time sake when you guys are learning this and setting this

173
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,880
up i'm just going to set up like three or four headlines and just two descriptions for you

174
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:05,440
these these are examples so please don't think that these are what i'm using or are the best ones the

175
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,920
best ones that you start out with always take what we got in the training and i always use those

176
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:15,120
headlines and those descriptions as my first few examples and then after that i start adding in

177
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:24,080
um of of my main keywords and and variants of that okay so here i'm going to do

178
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,080
my main keyword if i can fit it

179
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,400
okay almost there

180
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,040
so i'm going to do is i'm going to go here

181
00:18:52,320 --> 00:19:00,000
best concrete contractors okay all right and then bentonville concrete i'm going to put experts

182
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:11,120
call now for your free let's see if we can get code in there perfect

183
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:16,160
okay we have concrete contractors we have that and what you'll see is up here you guys see that

184
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:22,080
it'll sometimes it'll want to give you ideas and it'll help you get more of your keywords that you

185
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:27,120
put in into your into your headlines and what we're trying to do is we're trying to get this

186
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:33,520
ad strength indicator we want to get it to good or excellent that's where we want to go and

187
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:38,560
sometimes it just takes a little bit of working back and forth to get there okay so we have

188
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:44,720
okay so we have concrete contractors again we have that

189
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,320
so we're going to go here

190
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:05,440
okay so we're going to go with those for now again you want to you want to keep adding these

191
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:11,920
headlines and you want to make it's giving me stuff here like if i click here i can just copy this

192
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,200
all right and i can paste that right here

193
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,200
almost

194
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,600
okay so we're going to go with that you can see the ad string starting to move so as i add these

195
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:46,400
headlines in right it's going to keep getting up to good and or to excellent okay all right and

196
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:53,200
then with the descriptions we're going to do i'm just going to stick with two of them for right now

197
00:20:53,200 --> 00:21:01,200
and again i recommend that we just do what's in the script in the training okay and then you can

198
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:06,400
add sometimes it'll give you something to kind of work with here i typically don't use the

199
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,840
the suggested ones that google's trying to give you for the descriptions okay but you want to

200
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:16,160
take what we learned in the training that's in there in the digital steroids file and you

201
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:20,240
just copy and paste it in here and then you can just tweak it in the next two you can only add

202
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:27,760
four okay and then from here we're going to go down and for those of you that understand or learn

203
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:32,080
a little bit more about google ads there's site links and callouts we don't need to worry about

204
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:37,280
that right now maybe in the future we'll do some special videos to kind of get into that so do not

205
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:42,160
worry about those right now okay and then we're going to get into more asset types we're going

206
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:46,720
to go down and this is where we're going to add the callout feature this is adding the callout

207
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:52,560
feature to your website search campaign we're going to hit the plus calls it's going to ask

208
00:21:52,560 --> 00:22:00,560
for our phone number okay we're going to go here we're going to highlight that number we're going

209
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:12,240
to copy that and then we are going to paste that number in there okay now with this there are this

210
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:17,600
is where like if you maybe don't want your client getting calls throughout the night or super early

211
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:23,440
this is where you can set just this feature up so it says advanced options you can go here and

212
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:29,840
let's say your business owner starts the day at like seven like eight a.m. so maybe i'll turn the

213
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:35,920
ads on at seven the call this is just for the call only part of the ad i'll turn them on from seven

214
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:41,440
thirty and let's say they stop the day at like six o'clock so i'll let them run to like seven

215
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:51,040
okay and then you hit save okay so that added the callout and then we go here to apply

216
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:58,240
now we go back to this is again where we're setting up our ads okay this is a big step this

217
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:06,160
is setting up the keywords and then you roll into the ads here okay we're going to go down to here

218
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:12,640
and and that's about it from here we're going to hit next and that's going to take us to our

219
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,360
budget okay now this is where some of you are going to kind of gasp a little bit and that's

220
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:27,840
okay google will auto suggest things for you you can see here it's funny when when you watch the

221
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:32,160
original recording of this video you'll see that google keyword planner did not give me

222
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:39,680
um much cpc options but here i am at the budget portion and it's recommending a month a daily

223
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:47,840
budget of 278 a day and it's telling me my cpc is 949 okay so there obviously are ads running

224
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:52,640
there obviously a cpc for whatever reason when we did this right now it just didn't want to pull up

225
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,040
the cpc details what i'm going to do is i'm going to set up a custom budget

226
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:02,560
so it wants to recommend right it's going to tell me that if i ran 222 dollars a day

227
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:08,080
i'm going to get 190 clicks a week and it cost me 1500 dollars a month that may not be terrible

228
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,760
if you have someone paying you a lot of money but as we're starting this out what we're going to do

229
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:16,480
is we're going to set this up we're going to try about 25 dollars a day and we're going to see what

230
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,320
google tells me

231
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:30,800
so at this rate at 25 dollars a day it's telling me that i'm going to get about 69 clicks my cpc

232
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:38,240
is going to be a lot lower and this is going to be my weekly cost okay now we we have the ability

233
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,400
to go in here and adjust this but this is a good starting point because we're going to get some

234
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:47,120
data on the clicks and the search terms that we're winning and the ones maybe that we don't want

235
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:52,320
and i'll be a separate video and we set up our budget here and then we hit next

236
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,480
and now it's checking for errors

237
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,520
okay guys so after we set up our budget we're going to go ahead and it's going to kick us into

238
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,680
the review page here and all we want to do is before we hit publish we just want to make sure

239
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:16,160
that we set up everything i know in the beginning i talked about making sure that you didn't

240
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:21,840
accidentally have your display ads or search partner ads click this is the place to catch that

241
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,320
make sure that your objective is right and i'll show you right here so we want to make sure that

242
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,800
our campaign name is what we want it to be so that we understand what it is later when we look back

243
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:37,120
through this we want to make sure that it is a search campaign okay our main objective for this

244
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:43,760
is going to be a website traffic ad okay our main goal is going to be page views

245
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:50,560
and then our bidding we want to do maximize clicks google is always going to want to do

246
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:55,840
it's going to set up a default of conversions i advise against doing that especially in the

247
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:00,560
beginning it's not a bad tactic after three or four months of data but in the beginning you

248
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:05,520
want to have maximize clicks we go here review our we review our networks google search network

249
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,840
that's where we want to be this is where you'll see if you accidentally left that blue check

250
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,920
mark on for the display network or search partner you'll see that here this is the place to go and

251
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:18,960
you want to go back into your settings and change that okay make sure that your location is where

252
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,520
you want it that it's either in a setup as a radius or as i demonstrated it can set up in

253
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:28,640
individual cities make sure that they're all here and that that's going the going to fire at the

254
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:34,400
location you want at the fire app we used about eight keywords that's fine again i recommend

255
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:40,000
eight to 15 for these you know if you have just three or four solid ones there's nothing wrong

256
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,760
with that if you have 17 18 19 and they're all very related and you have data to support that

257
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:51,600
that's okay too but just just for recommendations eight to 15 you're in a goods place okay the

258
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:59,120
budget is 25 a day and from there we hit publish campaign and just as a reminder the first two days

259
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:03,600
are going to be what google calls a policy review and then just checking to make sure that there's

260
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:08,320
nothing spammy or fishy going on and then after that you have a five day period which they call

261
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:14,240
their learning strategy so the first seven days of your new google ad campaign takes some time

262
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:20,560
so the data and the results are not optimal so do not stress about it do not worry about it too much

263
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,960
that's part of the reason like even in the beginning when we were doing smart campaigns

264
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,840
that's why we recommended not really messing with your ads for the first 14 days i would double that

265
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,800
emphasis for the search campaigns as well

266
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,920
and with that good luck and let us know if you have any questions
