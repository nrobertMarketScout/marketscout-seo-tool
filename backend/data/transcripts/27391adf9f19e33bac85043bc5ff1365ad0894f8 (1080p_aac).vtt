WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:15.780
All right, let's go ahead and do the market analysis, the market research on the cities

00:15.780 --> 00:17.020
that you chose.

00:17.020 --> 00:22.840
And guys, again, I would recommend having a couple cities that you can look at because

00:22.840 --> 00:28.240
you may do your research on the first one, it doesn't fit the bill, and be okay, mentally

00:28.240 --> 00:34.640
be prepared to do 10, 15, 20 of these before you go ahead and build.

00:34.640 --> 00:38.520
That might not be the case because we've done a lot of legwork to start off, but if it ends

00:38.520 --> 00:41.320
up being the case, just be okay with it.

00:41.320 --> 00:45.880
Realize that that is time well spent and that it's going to be worth it in the long run

00:45.880 --> 00:48.920
because you're going to be able to avoid a bunch of SEO, okay?

00:48.920 --> 00:49.920
Let's go over to the screen.

00:49.920 --> 00:55.360
All right, so we're over here, I'm going to have you grab, there's going to be a download

00:55.360 --> 00:57.360
with the market research worksheet.

00:57.400 --> 01:00.920
It's also in the Facebook group, it should be here in the training as well.

01:00.920 --> 01:05.880
Just download that, and then what I want you to do is I want you to go and make a copy.

01:05.880 --> 01:10.560
So, you know, hit make a copy, name it however you want, I like to put the service city,

01:10.560 --> 01:12.800
I'll remove the template and go from there.

01:12.800 --> 01:14.600
I've already done this, I'm going to show you.

01:14.600 --> 01:19.440
I named it Concrete, Queen Creek, Arizona, due diligence, however you're going to remember

01:19.440 --> 01:20.960
it doesn't matter, okay?

01:20.960 --> 01:25.820
I fill out a few basic things, Concrete's the niche, it's 52,000 people, it should be

01:25.820 --> 01:26.820
phone driven.

01:26.900 --> 01:31.820
I keep this here to remind you, if it's a walk in business, if it's a dentist, probably

01:31.820 --> 01:33.220
not the niche you should be in, okay?

01:33.220 --> 01:37.180
But just trust me on the niches I'm recommending, so yes, it's a phone driven business.

01:37.180 --> 01:42.260
Next, what we're going to do is we're going to take our keyword list from the niche we

01:42.260 --> 01:47.020
decided on, which as I told you guys, if you can't decide, just choose Concrete.

01:47.020 --> 01:51.300
We're going to take those keywords and we're going to use these keywords to see what the

01:51.300 --> 01:55.420
competition looks like, because we want to rank for these keywords long term, so we want

01:55.420 --> 01:57.220
to see what kind of competition we're up against.

01:57.220 --> 02:01.780
Now, there's a word of caution, do not just do one keyword, do not type in Concrete,

02:01.780 --> 02:06.020
Contractor, Queen Creek, Arizona, do the homework on that one keyword and then make a decision

02:06.020 --> 02:08.300
based on that, because that's inaccurate.

02:08.300 --> 02:12.820
What I mean by that is you could potentially see a city where Concrete, Contractor, Queen

02:12.820 --> 02:17.340
Creek, Arizona is very, very competitive, and the other four, five, six terms that you

02:17.340 --> 02:20.260
search for, no competition, okay?

02:20.260 --> 02:24.460
You could also see the reverse, you look at one term, oh yeah, this is going to be awesome,

02:24.460 --> 02:29.780
next four terms, it's crazy competition, and you get your butt handed to you, okay?

02:29.780 --> 02:33.660
So you've got to use, and guys, I didn't do this, for years and years I didn't do this

02:33.660 --> 02:37.220
because I was never trained to do this, and I got into a lot of hot water, and this is

02:37.220 --> 02:38.820
part of the reason I had to get rid of so many sites.

02:38.820 --> 02:42.180
So you're going to take your list and you're going to take your core keywords.

02:42.180 --> 02:45.740
Now, as I told you, you should only have five to seven, I don't know why we have nine here,

02:45.740 --> 02:51.220
I'm only going to use five for this specific market research, and this is what I typically

02:51.220 --> 02:52.220
do, okay?

02:52.220 --> 02:56.540
So it's very, very simple, you got your document open, your market research worksheet open,

02:56.540 --> 03:00.740
and then what I'm going to have you do before we jump in is I'm going to have you go and

03:00.740 --> 03:02.700
go to the Google Chrome store.

03:02.700 --> 03:08.980
If, let me say this, if you're not using Google Chrome, stop what you're doing and go download

03:08.980 --> 03:09.980
Google Chrome.

03:09.980 --> 03:13.660
You shouldn't be using Safari and Firefox and all these things, just trust me on this,

03:13.660 --> 03:15.580
use Google Chrome, it's so much easier.

03:15.580 --> 03:18.900
If you don't know how to download Google Chrome, go YouTube it, go Google it, you literally

03:18.900 --> 03:23.220
could type in Google Chrome download, click download and it will walk you through it,

03:23.220 --> 03:25.940
it is not hard, but if you have any problems, YouTube it, okay?

03:25.940 --> 03:29.780
It's very simple, there's videos on everything, it's amazing and it's free, okay?

03:29.780 --> 03:33.980
Go download Google Chrome and then what I'm going to have you do is inside of Google Chrome,

03:33.980 --> 03:38.060
I'm going to have you type in Google Chrome store.

03:38.060 --> 03:42.620
You're going to go to the Google Chrome store, click on the first link, and I'm going kind

03:42.620 --> 03:46.980
of fast guys because I want to focus on the market research, not on all the little baby

03:46.980 --> 03:47.980
steps here.

03:48.060 --> 03:54.380
This is very simple stuff, Google Chrome web store, you're going to type in SEO Quake,

03:54.380 --> 03:56.620
this is what is called an extension, okay?

03:56.620 --> 04:02.260
It's free, type in SEO as in search engine optimization, Quake as in Quaker Oats, click

04:02.260 --> 04:08.540
on it, click on this one that has the green, SEO Quake, and then it's going to say add

04:08.540 --> 04:12.900
to Chrome, mine says remove because I've already added it, okay?

04:12.900 --> 04:15.700
Click add to Chrome, that's it, and then what's going to happen is you're going to go back

04:15.700 --> 04:20.460
over here, you're going to see this little guy right here, it might not show up in the

04:20.460 --> 04:24.780
top so you might have to click this puzzle piece and underneath it you'll have to click

04:24.780 --> 04:30.500
on this thumb tack and turn it blue, that means it's going to be pinned to the top of

04:30.500 --> 04:33.940
your search bar so it's really easily accessible, I would recommend doing that and then it should

04:33.940 --> 04:35.900
show up like this.

04:35.900 --> 04:39.980
And that is all the setup you need so have your market research worksheet ready, have

04:39.980 --> 04:43.860
your SEO Quake, have your keywords ready, and let's freaking shake and bake baby.

04:43.900 --> 04:47.100
So now what you're going to do is you're going to go to your keyword list and you're going

04:47.100 --> 04:50.900
to take your top five keywords and you're going to start plugging them in with the city

04:50.900 --> 04:57.420
and state, so concrete, Queen Creek, Arizona, concrete contractor, Queen Creek, Arizona,

04:57.420 --> 05:02.700
concrete company, Queen Creek, Arizona, concrete patio, Queen Creek, Arizona, concrete driveway,

05:02.700 --> 05:05.480
Queen Creek, Arizona, and then I always like to throw in a little curve ball and I like

05:05.480 --> 05:09.940
to take the first one, the main term, concrete, Queen Creek, Arizona, I like to take the city,

05:10.860 --> 05:15.400
and I like to switch it and search it, so Queen Creek, concrete, okay, beautiful.

05:15.400 --> 05:19.060
So now we've got five terms to look at and we're going to go and what we're going to

05:19.060 --> 05:23.980
look at now guys, we're going to look at which companies show up in the map section over

05:23.980 --> 05:27.620
and over and over for all of these terms because these are the terms that get the most search

05:27.620 --> 05:32.900
volume guys, realize, like I hope you guys are following along, these terms that we decided

05:32.900 --> 05:36.940
on, these have the most search volume nationwide.

05:36.940 --> 05:42.460
Now we want to see in the specific city we're looking at what companies are showing up for

05:42.460 --> 05:47.020
those terms, those are our competitors and then we want to look at those competitors

05:47.020 --> 05:50.980
and see what kind of work are they doing, are they competitors because they're good,

05:50.980 --> 05:54.560
are they competitors because there's no one else in the market, that's what we're looking

05:54.560 --> 05:59.180
for is those cities where people are in the top spots by default, not because they're

05:59.180 --> 06:03.200
doing something special, okay, so all we're going to do now is we're going to start looking

06:03.200 --> 06:08.360
at common allies, so I'm going to start off with Bowman, Bowman shows up for number one,

06:08.360 --> 06:12.680
Bowman shows up for number two, Bowman shows up for number three, Bowman shows up not for

06:12.680 --> 06:17.280
number four, shows up not for number five, shows up for number six, so four out of six

06:17.280 --> 06:21.040
I'm choosing Bowman and so what you're going to do is you're going to right click or you're

06:21.040 --> 06:24.240
going to push command if you're on a Mac, you're going to open their website, you're

06:24.240 --> 06:29.320
going to copy and paste this sucker over here into this sheet, so you're going to put it

06:29.600 --> 06:35.120
once under the citations, once under the backlinks, once under the content, once under the domain,

06:35.120 --> 06:39.640
let me explain this, the reason we are doing specifically looking at the citations which

06:39.640 --> 06:44.400
I'm going to explain, the backlinks I'm going to explain, the content I'm going to explain

06:44.400 --> 06:48.320
and the age of domain I'm going to explain is because these are the main factors when

06:48.320 --> 06:52.160
it comes to ranking a website organically and in the maps and so those are the things

06:52.160 --> 06:59.160
we want to look at, we don't care what their logo looks like, we don't care how much they

06:59.400 --> 07:06.400
have, how many, I don't know, customer testimonials, those things don't affect ranking, we care

07:06.400 --> 07:10.640
about how old is their domain, how much content do they have on their website, how many backlinks

07:10.640 --> 07:13.520
they have and how many citations, I'm going to show you how to find all of them and what

07:13.520 --> 07:17.480
they mean, how we can interpret them but for the sake of this what I want you to do is

07:17.480 --> 07:22.920
go and find the next three companies that would fit inside of here that show up for

07:22.920 --> 07:27.440
the majority, so if you have six terms that you're searching, one, two, three, four, five,

07:27.600 --> 07:32.240
six, I want to know the company that shows up at least four out of six times, minimum.

07:32.240 --> 07:36.920
Now if you start seeing and there's not any commonalities and there's different companies

07:36.920 --> 07:40.720
every single time, that's actually a good thing, that means there's no steady, like

07:40.720 --> 07:45.820
somebody that Google can rely on and so don't stress it, if you can't find anyone that shows

07:45.820 --> 07:52.040
up for four out of six, find someone that shows up for three out of six and just don't

07:52.040 --> 07:53.860
overthink it.

07:53.860 --> 07:57.960
Another thing I want to point out is when you see the following which I have found,

07:57.960 --> 08:00.620
this is my favorite thing, this is why I'm talking a little fast, getting a little excited

08:00.620 --> 08:05.260
but when you see what I'm about to show you, you have found some freaking gold my friends

08:05.260 --> 08:10.060
and what that is is you have a company like this, Copper Star Concrete LLC dash Steve

08:10.060 --> 08:16.500
Wood, shout out to Steve, okay, you got Steve over here, homeboy does not have a website,

08:16.500 --> 08:21.660
no website, it's 2022, he's ranking number one, question is does he rank for every single

08:21.860 --> 08:26.060
search term or at least the majority, if he does, we have found some freaking gold baby.

08:26.060 --> 08:32.300
Okay, so let's go to the first one, there's Steve, one out of one, there's not Steve,

08:32.300 --> 08:38.500
so one for two, oh no, no there's Steve, two for two, there's Steve, three for three, Steve's

08:38.500 --> 08:43.540
four for six, Steve made the cut guys, Steve's five for six, the only one Steve does not

08:43.540 --> 08:48.380
rank for is the last term, throw Steve on the sheet guys, let's freaking rock and roll,

08:48.380 --> 08:53.060
what you're gonna do here is you're just gonna copy his thing, like his whatever and you're

08:53.060 --> 08:57.900
gonna go over here and boom, boom, I didn't even copy it, maybe just put like, you can

08:57.900 --> 09:03.540
just put Steve, it doesn't matter, like you're just, you're literally just acknowledging

09:03.540 --> 09:08.860
that this guy does not have a website which is absolutely asinine, I love it, it makes

09:08.860 --> 09:13.780
me happy because what that means guys is Google, you gotta realize, Google's literally saying,

09:13.780 --> 09:17.340
look at this, okay, Google's saying to me as a homeowner, because they think I'm a homeowner

09:17.340 --> 09:21.740
I'm looking, right, I think I'm a customer, they're saying, hey Mr. Homeowner, you're

09:21.740 --> 09:27.340
looking for concrete, well here's Steve, he's one of the top three choices in town, sorry

09:27.340 --> 09:32.460
he doesn't have a website, you know, all that stuff, but he's your best, he's one of your

09:32.460 --> 09:36.700
top three choices, that is garbage, that is absolute garbage, what that shows me is there's

09:36.700 --> 09:42.020
a lack of competition and I love that, so if you guys see this, a web, sorry, a listing

09:43.020 --> 09:48.020
that shows up for four out of the six or the majority of the terms, okay, have at least

09:48.020 --> 09:52.820
five or more, and they do not have a website, you can almost guarantee this is gonna be

09:52.820 --> 09:59.080
a yes, okay, almost guaranteed, I would even like venture to say it's a yes immediately,

09:59.080 --> 10:01.900
but I'm gonna keep doing this, okay, so we're gonna add Steve and then we're gonna add another

10:01.900 --> 10:06.500
one and then what we're gonna do guys is we're gonna go and find the information that's necessary,

10:06.500 --> 10:09.660
so we're gonna find the citations, we're gonna find the backlinks, we're gonna find the content,

10:09.660 --> 10:13.060
we're gonna find the domain, okay, the age of the domain, so what you're gonna use is

10:13.060 --> 10:17.580
this SEOquake tool and all you're gonna do is go to their site, so remember how I opened

10:17.580 --> 10:23.260
old Stevie's site, okay, inside of Steve's site this SEOquake tool should be showing

10:23.260 --> 10:27.420
up, if it's not you need to go over here and it's probably toggled off, you need to make

10:27.420 --> 10:32.580
sure that SEOquake is enabled and then you should see this, okay, if you don't it'll

10:32.580 --> 10:37.440
typically show up underneath here as well, see how it's added it here, so you could actually

10:37.520 --> 10:44.520
see it in the organic listings as well, it'll tell you L, that's the backlinks, it's gonna

10:44.600 --> 10:50.800
tell you, where's the G, I'll have to show you another way to do this as well, it's not

10:50.800 --> 10:56.080
showing the G which is the number of pages, the Google thing which I can show you a different

10:56.080 --> 11:01.080
way of doing that, but very simply this one right here it says NA, why, because this isn't

11:01.080 --> 11:07.080
even a real website, this is a WW1.bomanarchitecture, this is garbage, okay, so I'm gonna go and

11:07.080 --> 11:13.520
I'm gonna put, you know, content, NA, because it doesn't even make sense, okay, I'm gonna

11:13.520 --> 11:19.600
go back, L, that's number of backlinks, zero, I think you guys are seeing what I'm seeing

11:19.600 --> 11:26.600
here right, zero, backlinks, boop, zero, awesome, domain, now the way that you're gonna go ahead

11:26.800 --> 11:31.280
and find the domain, you used to be able to go like this and inside of SEOquake you could

11:31.280 --> 11:35.440
click on the who is and then you could click I'm not a robot and you could click go, I

11:35.520 --> 11:38.480
wanna show you something that's really funny based on what I said on another video, come

11:38.480 --> 11:42.920
on baby, spinnin', let's go, okay, actually you can do this, it depends on the website,

11:42.920 --> 11:48.680
you can do it this way, you're gonna scroll down and you're gonna look for, it says too

11:48.680 --> 11:57.680
many requests, let's see, right here, created on 2018, it's 2018, boom, if this isn't working

11:58.680 --> 12:05.680
for some reason, you can also go to something like duplichecker.com, just type in how to

12:06.840 --> 12:10.480
find age of domain and you'll find something like that, but you just wanna find out what

12:10.480 --> 12:17.480
year the domain was put live, what year the website went live, okay, and that's all you're

12:18.120 --> 12:22.320
gonna do and then you're gonna do the citations, now the citations you're gonna go to something

12:22.320 --> 12:29.320
called Whitespark, you can literally type in Whitespark.ca, you can get a free account,

12:29.360 --> 12:36.200
so Whitespark.ca and you're gonna go and once you create a free account you're gonna hover

12:36.200 --> 12:42.080
over this, right here, you're gonna hover over local SEO software, it's kind of a hover

12:42.080 --> 12:48.160
and then go over to local citation finder, okay, and what you're gonna do is you're gonna

12:48.200 --> 12:54.480
try it free, thank you SEO White Spark, okay, you're gonna try this free and you're gonna

12:54.480 --> 13:01.480
go over to searches, not campaigns but searches and then you're gonna go and type in new search,

13:01.480 --> 13:07.240
okay, let me make sure I got this right, new search and you're gonna toggle this to business

13:07.240 --> 13:10.680
search, and what we're gonna do is we're gonna go and I've already done Bowman so I'm gonna

13:10.680 --> 13:15.680
do old Steve, I'm excited to see how many Steve has, old Copper Star Concrete, you're

13:15.680 --> 13:21.440
gonna click on it and you're gonna copy this exact thing, okay, boom, we're gonna come

13:21.440 --> 13:26.480
back over to Whitespark, business name, copy and paste, exactly, I know it looks janky,

13:26.480 --> 13:33.480
it is janky, copy it exactly, okay, go back, copy the number, exactly, okay, Steve Wood,

13:34.160 --> 13:41.160
you know what's crazy about this, this guy has a 435 number, guys, this is a, you know

13:41.840 --> 13:47.440
this 435 is an area code that I have, that is insane, that is, well I did have, this

13:47.440 --> 13:54.440
is a Utah area code, I'm loving everything I'm seeing about this, okay, so copy and paste

13:54.440 --> 14:01.440
it, sorry I'm a little bit behind here, boom, city, Queen Creek, autofill, AZ and push,

14:02.320 --> 14:06.240
create search, this is gonna take a minute and it's going to spit out a result and it's

14:06.240 --> 14:10.880
gonna give us the number of citations and we're gonna have this, so I want you guys

14:10.880 --> 14:14.440
to do this for all of the three different people that you have found, so you should

14:14.440 --> 14:20.920
have three, now, if you go through and it's Helter Skelter, there's only one that's consistent,

14:20.920 --> 14:27.320
one of them has no website and the third one it's like, it's just like, there's no commonality

14:27.320 --> 14:31.360
amongst all of your search terms, for example, you know, you can't see the same person showing

14:31.360 --> 14:36.640
up twice, what I would do is I would go and dip into the organic and I would choose the

14:36.640 --> 14:40.600
first company that's an actual company, not a home advisor, not an Angie's List, not

14:40.600 --> 14:46.560
a BBB, but a company, so rock solid in this case, I would choose them and I would put

14:46.560 --> 14:51.840
them right here and I would probably skip a row and put them under here, you know, copy

14:51.840 --> 14:58.360
and paste it, I didn't even grab the domain, and I would say, you know, no consistent third

14:58.360 --> 15:05.280
option, and then I would grab this guy, wherever he's at, and I would just go ahead and put

15:05.280 --> 15:12.120
him here, oh boy, sorry, I'm in the wrong one, I've got to go right here, cool, I'd

15:12.120 --> 15:15.480
put him here, I'd put him here, I'd put him here, and I would do the homework on this

15:15.480 --> 15:20.200
one because there's just not three competitors, that also is a good sign, okay, so what I'm

15:20.200 --> 15:26.320
gonna do here guys, I'm gonna pause this really quick, I am going to finish this worksheet

15:26.320 --> 15:30.040
without making you guys watch me do it, I'm gonna come back, we're gonna assess it and

15:30.040 --> 15:33.400
determine whether Queen Creek is a go or not, I can tell you right now it's already a go

15:33.520 --> 15:39.480
because of Mr. Stevie Boy, okay, so give me one second, guys, here we go, I've got this

15:39.480 --> 15:43.440
thing completed, I'm just gonna go through it really quick, so the companies I chose

15:43.440 --> 15:48.640
was Bowman, Desert Installations, they were a company that kept showing up over and over

15:48.640 --> 15:53.480
and over, they don't show up in the first term, but they showed up a ton, so I chose

15:53.480 --> 15:59.240
them, and then the third one was Steve, which was that copper star concrete LLC Steve, and

16:00.080 --> 16:06.880
yeah, that's what's interesting about this, so obviously if you look at this, I did all

16:06.880 --> 16:11.520
the stuff I told you to, I found the backlinks for Desert Installations, they had two backlinks,

16:11.520 --> 16:19.040
they had one page of content, their domain was 20-20, and then of course on Steve, there

16:19.040 --> 16:23.760
was no backlinks because he didn't have a website, there was no content because he doesn't

16:23.760 --> 16:27.840
have a website, and his domain was NA because he doesn't have a new website, so it was really

16:27.840 --> 16:32.760
easy, okay, so how do we look at this, how do we assess it, I also found the citations

16:32.760 --> 16:36.480
for these other companies, as I told you, this will spit you back a number, and you

16:36.480 --> 16:42.340
just wanna list this number right here, and we can get into citations later, basically

16:42.340 --> 16:47.640
just so you guys know, citations is the name, address, and phone number of the listing,

16:47.640 --> 16:54.640
so for example, this right here, Bowman Concrete, this address, this phone number, it's the

16:54.840 --> 16:59.560
domain, address, phone number, they call it the NAP, it's how many places around the internet

16:59.560 --> 17:06.560
that exact matched NAP, exact matched NAP or NAP is listed around the internet, so places

17:08.840 --> 17:13.560
like, yo, places like Facebook, places, they call these directories, they call these citations,

17:13.560 --> 17:20.560
and it's listed exactly, so for example, Copper Star is listed in 14 places, exactly the same,

17:21.400 --> 17:28.400
okay, Desert Installation, 11, and Bowman, 46, okay, honestly, I don't pay too much attention,

17:28.400 --> 17:32.480
but it is nice to know when you start doing citations, which we're gonna get into later,

17:32.480 --> 17:37.080
so how do we interpret this, well, the only other thing I like to do is once I do this,

17:37.080 --> 17:42.280
I wanna know, okay, Bowman, you dirty dog, I wanna know where you're ranking, so for

17:42.280 --> 17:49.280
example, on this first term, I wanna see if Bowman's on page one, no, no, no, not on page

17:49.320 --> 17:54.560
one, okay, what about the second term, looking for Bowman's website, remember Bowman's website

17:54.560 --> 17:59.440
here, which is an absolute junker, let's go ahead and grab it, if you wanna remember it,

17:59.440 --> 18:05.760
Bowman Architectural, nope, nope, nope, nope, nothing, not on that one, okay, I'm looking

18:05.760 --> 18:11.520
to see how many of these top three are actually showing up on page one, none, none so far,

18:11.520 --> 18:18.520
okay, Bowman is not showing up for one term on page one organically, okay, nope, nope,

18:19.560 --> 18:23.440
nope, I'm even on page two, nothing, okay, guys, this is a layup, I'm telling you right

18:23.440 --> 18:27.240
now, it's a layup, and I have no plans of going into this, so the first person to watch

18:27.240 --> 18:31.280
this video, if you wanna go grab this, this is a freaking layup, so check this out, let

18:31.280 --> 18:38.280
me look at this last one, just in case, Bowman, where you at, dog, nope, so, no Bowman, so

18:38.320 --> 18:45.320
what I'm gonna put here, I'm gonna go over and I'm gonna say, not ranking page one organic,

18:45.840 --> 18:51.840
any terms, boom, now we're gonna go look at desert installation, and by the way, I already

18:51.840 --> 18:56.720
know this, they're not ranking because I've looked, by the way, just to save the time,

18:56.720 --> 19:00.720
desert installation is not ranking on page one for their website either, okay, so I've

19:00.720 --> 19:06.720
already done it, they're not, so, and then Steve doesn't have a website, no website,

19:06.720 --> 19:12.640
so how do we determine, how do we interpret this, well, here's the question, does this

19:12.640 --> 19:18.240
niche look like low-hanging fruit, yes, and I'm not kidding you, I'm gonna stab about

19:18.240 --> 19:23.240
six of these, 20 of these, 30 of these, I'm pumped about this niche, yes, now here's the

19:23.240 --> 19:29.520
reasons why I'm excited, number one, Steve, who's a top competitor in the maps, does not

19:29.520 --> 19:33.080
have a website, therefore he's not ranking on page one, therefore he's not a threat,

19:33.080 --> 19:38.680
Steve is not doing well, and he is one of the top companies in Queen Creek, number two,

19:38.680 --> 19:43.560
the other companies in here, for example, Bowman Architectural, well, number one, they're

19:43.560 --> 19:47.400
like an architectural company, we wouldn't have that in the domain, number two, their

19:47.400 --> 19:57.360
website is weird, they have no backlinks, it's just a weird site, it's not a traditional,

19:57.360 --> 20:03.080
there's nothing, there's no content, it sucks, okay, and on top of that, they're not ranking

20:03.080 --> 20:08.200
on page one, which is beautiful, and then desert installations, it's a brand new website,

20:08.720 --> 20:12.520
if they're new, that's better for you, it means they're easier to outrank, Google, just

20:12.520 --> 20:18.400
for the record, they like older websites, to Google, an older website means it's a company

20:18.400 --> 20:22.080
that's gonna be in business for a lot longer, it's a more trusted company, and that's what

20:22.080 --> 20:26.880
they like, so the fact that these are both newer websites really makes me excited, desert

20:26.880 --> 20:32.120
installations also does not show up on page one, what this tells me is, guys, Google is

20:32.120 --> 20:36.600
searching for somebody to put in the top spot in the maps, and in the organic, and no one

20:37.000 --> 20:42.320
is doing what they want, no one's proving to Google, hey, I'm the guy, I'm the girl,

20:42.320 --> 20:46.200
I'm the website, I'm the company, you should use me, you should put me at the top, they're

20:46.200 --> 20:51.960
not doing anything correctly to incentivize Google to put them at the top, and therefore

20:51.960 --> 20:57.060
there's a lack of options, and Google is putting some garbage companies, okay, there's probably

20:57.060 --> 21:01.720
good companies that do work in Queen Creek, but they don't know what they're doing online,

21:01.760 --> 21:06.800
so what that allows us is an opportunity to come in with our freaking ninja tricks, build

21:06.800 --> 21:12.120
a website, rank that sucker really rapidly, and capture those leads, and why does this

21:12.120 --> 21:16.720
matter if we're gonna run ads, and we're gonna get the client first, because guys, if you

21:16.720 --> 21:21.320
wanna do this long term, and you wanna rank this organically, you wanna see what kind

21:21.320 --> 21:24.720
of work you're cutting out for yourself, right, because once I get the deal, now I'm gonna

21:24.720 --> 21:28.040
go to work, now I'm gonna build a website, now I'm gonna do the content, and the backlinks,

21:28.040 --> 21:31.680
and the whole deal, and I don't wanna get into a dog fight, I wanna make sure that we're

21:31.680 --> 21:35.160
good, when I get the deal, I don't have to do that much work, guys, once I get a deal

21:35.160 --> 21:40.360
in Queen Creek, build this website, or one of you does, this website with some decent

21:40.360 --> 21:44.820
SEO is gonna rank in a matter of a couple of months, if not a couple of weeks, which

21:44.820 --> 21:48.440
means you're gonna be able to turn off the ads almost instantly, so this thing is gonna

21:48.440 --> 21:54.440
be a cash freaking cow if we can find somebody that will take these leads, that's already

21:54.440 --> 22:00.080
paying for leads, et cetera, so I just want you guys to understand, when you're doing

22:00.240 --> 22:06.040
these things, take your time, if it is not an overwhelming yes, okay, and by the way,

22:06.040 --> 22:09.760
this is kind of like a really extreme example, you don't come across these all the time,

22:09.760 --> 22:15.440
that's why I'm talking so fast, I'm so pumped, but I want there to be no doubt in your mind

22:15.440 --> 22:20.440
that this is going to be easy to rank, I do wanna mention one last thing, is if you see

22:20.440 --> 22:25.320
that every company in the map, so let's say the top three companies, which in this case

22:25.320 --> 22:32.320
was Bowman and Desert Installations and Copperstar, if you see that all three of those companies

22:32.840 --> 22:38.120
that you've determined are the top three consistently, if they're all showing up on page one organically,

22:38.120 --> 22:44.640
which again is below the maps, if you see that, run, that is not somewhere you wanna

22:44.640 --> 22:51.360
be, that is a very competitive niche and city combination, so again, if all the competitors,

22:51.360 --> 22:55.840
the top three people, after looking at all five terms, those three people are showing

22:55.840 --> 23:02.840
up for the majority of the terms on page one organically, that's underneath the maps, run,

23:03.720 --> 23:07.480
this is not worth your time, there's other cities and niche combos out there that are

23:07.480 --> 23:10.920
gonna make, it's gonna make way more sense, it's gonna be way easier to rank, and you're

23:10.920 --> 23:16.040
gonna make, you're frankly gonna make way more money, so for this one guys, I'm telling

23:16.120 --> 23:21.520
you, this is an absolute freaking yes, I'm gonna build the landing page, I'm gonna run

23:21.520 --> 23:26.520
the ads, I'm gonna get the deal, and we're gonna freaking get a website crankin' really,

23:26.520 --> 23:33.520
really fast, I'm gonna lower the ads, and I'm gonna put some cheddar in my pocket, baby.
