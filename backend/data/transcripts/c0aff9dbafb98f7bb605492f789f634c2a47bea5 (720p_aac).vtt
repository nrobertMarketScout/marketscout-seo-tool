WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.960
Let me see.

00:01.960 --> 00:03.120
There we go.

00:03.120 --> 00:06.520
Okay, I don't see the Facebook comments for some reason,

00:06.520 --> 00:11.520
but Jason, Aaron, can you kind of check that out

00:12.040 --> 00:14.080
as we have questions, comments come in?

00:14.080 --> 00:15.080
Can you let me know?

00:16.080 --> 00:17.360
Yeah, for sure.

00:18.520 --> 00:21.800
I will say that one comment I saw on the teaser post you did

00:21.800 --> 00:24.640
that Heather mentioned that she's excited for this live

00:24.640 --> 00:25.920
because this is one of the bigger things

00:25.920 --> 00:28.440
that she sees as a roadblock now for her

00:28.440 --> 00:30.200
is qualifying business owners.

00:30.200 --> 00:31.240
Yeah.

00:31.240 --> 00:32.440
So let's do this.

00:34.440 --> 00:36.760
And by the way, I'm gonna give,

00:39.400 --> 00:41.960
I'm gonna give Aaron, I'm gonna give you co-host

00:41.960 --> 00:45.600
if you're not already because in case my internet,

00:45.600 --> 00:49.200
sometimes it's shaky here, I don't know why.

00:49.200 --> 00:50.840
So let's, I wanna say a few things

00:50.840 --> 00:53.120
and then I'm gonna have Porter,

00:53.120 --> 00:54.840
I'll ask Porter a couple of questions, you as well,

00:54.840 --> 00:57.600
and then we'll go into some Q&A stuff, okay?

00:57.600 --> 00:58.440
Does that sound good, Aaron?

00:58.440 --> 01:00.240
You can hear me though, right?

01:00.240 --> 01:01.720
Yeah, sounds good.

01:01.720 --> 01:06.720
Beautiful, all right, so what I learned

01:07.160 --> 01:09.200
and I'm gonna kind of go back to when I first started,

01:09.200 --> 01:13.840
I remember back in 2016, first deal, towing deal,

01:13.840 --> 01:16.720
of course you guys have probably heard the story,

01:16.720 --> 01:19.280
I did everything wrong, I got lucky,

01:19.280 --> 01:21.040
I picked the right area on accident,

01:21.040 --> 01:24.360
the niche wasn't the greatest, but I still got the deal.

01:24.360 --> 01:29.360
And I remember that that client was the biggest pain

01:31.320 --> 01:33.520
in the butt of anything.

01:33.520 --> 01:37.560
Now, yes, it was a $600 deal, yes, it was my first deal,

01:37.560 --> 01:39.120
yes, I was excited about that more

01:39.120 --> 01:41.720
than probably any other deal that I got,

01:41.720 --> 01:46.720
but I had to work so much for that deal to get paid,

01:47.600 --> 01:49.680
it was unbelievable.

01:49.680 --> 01:51.840
And so I want you guys to know that when you get

01:51.840 --> 01:53.480
that first deal, Porter, I know you've dealt with this,

01:53.480 --> 01:56.360
Aaron, I'm sure you've dealt with this,

01:56.360 --> 01:59.240
it happens, you're excited, you wanna get that deal,

01:59.240 --> 02:01.720
that first person that talks to you,

02:01.720 --> 02:03.720
that says they'll take your leads,

02:03.720 --> 02:05.640
you kind of throw yourselves at them

02:05.640 --> 02:08.040
because you're like, oh my gosh, this is actually working,

02:08.040 --> 02:13.040
somebody's interested, and it takes you going down the road

02:13.120 --> 02:14.880
and having the deal go sideways,

02:14.880 --> 02:16.560
having the business owner not pay you,

02:16.560 --> 02:19.800
having the business owner not be able to close deals.

02:19.800 --> 02:21.760
The worst though is sending the leads,

02:21.800 --> 02:23.560
the business owners, three, four, five leads,

02:23.560 --> 02:25.480
and then getting ghosted because all they wanted

02:25.480 --> 02:27.120
was freebies, right?

02:27.120 --> 02:28.200
There's all these variables.

02:28.200 --> 02:31.120
So guys, I've said this a few times before

02:31.120 --> 02:33.440
and I want you guys to remember this,

02:33.440 --> 02:38.440
just because you can get money from a person,

02:39.120 --> 02:41.160
just because you can close a deal,

02:41.160 --> 02:43.200
just because somebody will say yes,

02:43.200 --> 02:46.200
does not mean that you should agree to it, okay?

02:46.200 --> 02:48.200
It's the same thing in the free Facebook group,

02:48.200 --> 02:51.040
I tell people all the time, and in this group as well,

02:51.040 --> 02:54.920
just because somebody is willing to give you advice

02:54.920 --> 02:56.400
does not mean that you should take it, okay?

02:56.400 --> 02:58.040
Just because someone's willing to pay you

02:58.040 --> 03:00.280
just does not mean that you should take it.

03:00.280 --> 03:02.200
This is something that I live by,

03:02.200 --> 03:03.640
this is including in this group,

03:03.640 --> 03:06.400
there are people that we have gotten on the phone with,

03:06.400 --> 03:07.560
they have wanted to join this group,

03:07.560 --> 03:09.840
they're interested in starting a business,

03:09.840 --> 03:13.200
and we can literally tell they are probably

03:13.200 --> 03:15.560
not gonna finish paying the tuition,

03:15.560 --> 03:18.040
they're gonna be a complete problem,

03:18.040 --> 03:20.080
way more questions than, you know,

03:20.080 --> 03:22.000
they're gonna take more than they're gonna give,

03:22.000 --> 03:23.680
and sometimes it's just not worth it.

03:23.680 --> 03:26.400
So, we wanna talk about qualifying,

03:26.400 --> 03:29.440
and guys, I know that a lot of times,

03:29.440 --> 03:31.880
again, during those first few deals,

03:31.880 --> 03:34.000
it's almost like you're willing to do anything,

03:34.000 --> 03:36.960
it's like, well, at least it's money, right?

03:36.960 --> 03:38.120
That's not true, okay?

03:38.120 --> 03:40.280
My first deal I got, this guy named,

03:41.120 --> 03:43.760
what was his, I don't even remember his name,

03:43.760 --> 03:44.760
but anyway, he was a towing guy,

03:44.760 --> 03:46.600
I closed the deal in person,

03:46.640 --> 03:50.240
and guys, I fought like crazy to get this money every month,

03:50.240 --> 03:53.400
and eventually, it was just not worth it

03:53.400 --> 03:54.960
after some period of time,

03:54.960 --> 03:56.800
and I'm gonna contrast that,

03:58.040 --> 04:02.040
I got a deal with a company back in 2019,

04:03.480 --> 04:06.000
was it 2019 or 2018?

04:06.000 --> 04:09.400
One of those years, I think it might've been 2019,

04:09.400 --> 04:11.240
and then it bled into 2020,

04:11.240 --> 04:16.160
this client, I sent them literally one lead,

04:16.200 --> 04:18.920
they escalated me to the marketing director,

04:18.920 --> 04:21.240
it was a huge company that owned another company,

04:21.240 --> 04:23.760
and I got to the top of the company,

04:23.760 --> 04:26.680
and guys, there was a month or two in there

04:26.680 --> 04:29.000
that they cut me a check for $30,000,

04:29.000 --> 04:31.240
just how big this client got,

04:31.240 --> 04:33.880
and the most amazing part is,

04:33.880 --> 04:36.760
this was the most low maintenance of all the clients.

04:39.120 --> 04:40.480
Can you guys hear me still?

04:41.960 --> 04:44.800
Okay, it's like, it sounds funny,

04:44.800 --> 04:47.960
but usually, the bigger the client,

04:47.960 --> 04:50.120
the easier they are to maintain, okay?

04:50.120 --> 04:54.000
Francesca just landed us a deal for $7,500 per month,

04:54.000 --> 04:57.720
I have not communicated with that business.

04:57.720 --> 05:00.080
Personally, I have not communicated with that business,

05:00.080 --> 05:01.840
I'm not interested in communicating that business.

05:01.840 --> 05:04.840
They are low maintenance, yes, we check in once a week,

05:04.840 --> 05:07.760
but it's worth it, 7,500 bucks a month,

05:07.760 --> 05:09.560
so anyway, let's talk about qualifying.

05:09.560 --> 05:12.560
Porter, I know for you, you landed a few deals,

05:12.560 --> 05:15.280
you got excited, and you were snagging deals,

05:15.280 --> 05:17.880
and I think you were kind of just working with anybody,

05:17.880 --> 05:19.240
because you were just excited,

05:19.240 --> 05:22.200
and then you ended up losing two or three of those deals,

05:22.200 --> 05:24.640
so what did you learn throughout that process?

05:25.960 --> 05:28.320
Dude, it was all, I was calling the wrong people,

05:28.320 --> 05:31.320
first of all, even though I know I know

05:31.320 --> 05:35.280
what I should be doing, I still wanna, I get lazy,

05:35.280 --> 05:37.520
I'm like, oh, I've called everyone on my list,

05:37.520 --> 05:39.280
I don't wanna go write another list,

05:39.280 --> 05:41.740
so I start calling people on Facebook,

05:41.740 --> 05:45.580
I start calling people that aren't running ads,

05:45.580 --> 05:48.780
and I don't know why I thought that I could be the one

05:48.780 --> 05:52.020
to just make those sales, but I'm not, and they're cheap,

05:52.020 --> 05:55.420
everyone that's not doing that is not gonna pay

05:55.420 --> 05:57.660
for the service, so I was calling the wrong people,

05:57.660 --> 06:01.260
and I really don't think, the first two deals that I landed,

06:01.260 --> 06:02.500
I was asking the right questions,

06:02.500 --> 06:04.780
I was bringing up the objections before,

06:04.780 --> 06:06.180
I was talking about the contract,

06:06.180 --> 06:08.940
I was talking about how the deal would look

06:08.940 --> 06:10.420
before I got on the call,

06:10.580 --> 06:14.020
and there was just some things that I just was muffled,

06:14.020 --> 06:18.060
I was just like, oh, I did that, but he already knows,

06:18.060 --> 06:19.740
but he doesn't, you have to bring it up,

06:19.740 --> 06:22.340
you have to ask him, and so those were some things

06:22.340 --> 06:26.540
that I have caught myself, and even just my energy of,

06:27.860 --> 06:29.500
being excited about the business model,

06:29.500 --> 06:31.440
I was definitely a little bit under the weather,

06:31.440 --> 06:34.240
I wasn't as excited, I was probably making it seem

06:34.240 --> 06:36.260
like he wasn't gonna get very many leads,

06:36.260 --> 06:39.620
I was trying to downplay it too much,

06:39.620 --> 06:40.900
so there were some things I didn't do,

06:40.900 --> 06:43.340
but I do think the questions that you ask

06:43.340 --> 06:45.340
are very important, and if they say,

06:45.340 --> 06:46.420
me and Aaron talked about this,

06:46.420 --> 06:49.900
but if they say yes, yes, yes, you should be worried,

06:49.900 --> 06:52.500
because most of the time, there's gonna be a few questions

06:52.500 --> 06:55.220
that come up beforehand, I mean, occasionally,

06:55.220 --> 06:57.620
you'll get one that's like, hey, that all makes sense,

06:57.620 --> 06:59.860
let's work together, but most of the time,

06:59.860 --> 07:02.100
the ones that are actually serious about it

07:02.100 --> 07:04.280
have genuine questions from the beginning,

07:04.280 --> 07:06.100
and they're asking you, and those are the ones

07:06.100 --> 07:08.780
that are gonna stick with you longer.

07:08.780 --> 07:12.700
If it sounds too good to be true, it usually is,

07:12.700 --> 07:14.300
that's what I've learned, okay?

07:14.300 --> 07:17.460
Another principle that I've learned, guys, is,

07:17.460 --> 07:19.140
so I wanna come back to this port to remind me,

07:19.140 --> 07:20.580
I wanna come back to talking to people

07:20.580 --> 07:21.740
that are already paying for ads,

07:21.740 --> 07:23.860
so don't let me forget that, but I wanna mention something,

07:23.860 --> 07:25.660
guys, this is the same thing that I learned

07:25.660 --> 07:29.940
doing door-to-door sales, is if I was on the door,

07:29.940 --> 07:34.140
and so I looked at the sale as two parts,

07:34.140 --> 07:37.580
the door approach and the inside the house and the clothes,

07:38.100 --> 07:39.900
now, granted, there was actually three parts,

07:39.900 --> 07:42.500
there was the door approach, the presentation,

07:42.500 --> 07:44.380
and the clothes, so let's say there's three parts.

07:44.380 --> 07:47.500
What I learned, guys, is that if it was easy for me

07:47.500 --> 07:51.060
to get in the house, no objections, whatever, boom,

07:51.060 --> 07:52.780
they was like, yep, come in,

07:52.780 --> 07:55.860
I was gonna be up for a tough close.

07:55.860 --> 07:58.940
If the door approach was tough, and I had to overcome

07:58.940 --> 08:01.420
one or two objections before they let me in the house,

08:01.420 --> 08:03.860
there was a good chance I was gonna get that deal,

08:03.860 --> 08:07.340
and so back to that, I bet you every single person

08:08.180 --> 08:11.300
out here that's talked to, made at least 50 calls,

08:11.300 --> 08:13.100
we've all dealt with a business owner,

08:13.100 --> 08:14.820
like Porter's talking about, yeah, yeah, yeah,

08:14.820 --> 08:17.060
that sounds good, sounds good, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

08:17.060 --> 08:18.700
and you're just like, yep, and it's like,

08:18.700 --> 08:21.020
it can't be that easy, it's not that easy.

08:21.020 --> 08:23.820
If it's too good to be true, it probably is, okay?

08:23.820 --> 08:25.420
If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is,

08:25.420 --> 08:28.540
so back to what Porter was talking about, guys,

08:28.540 --> 08:32.300
in the training, we talk about this,

08:32.300 --> 08:35.700
in the training, we talk about when you build your list,

08:35.700 --> 08:40.700
why not make it half as easy, twice as easy, half as hard?

08:40.700 --> 08:44.460
Why try to, if you're calling just any random Joe,

08:44.460 --> 08:47.660
you are having to sell them on the idea of paying for leads,

08:47.660 --> 08:52.660
paying for marketing, and on you, right?

08:52.780 --> 08:54.700
If you are selling to people

08:54.700 --> 08:56.700
who are already paying for leads,

08:56.700 --> 08:59.020
you only have to sell them on you.

08:59.020 --> 08:59.980
You don't have to sell them

08:59.980 --> 09:01.500
on why they should be paying for it.

09:01.500 --> 09:06.500
So it is, even if it takes longer to find an area

09:06.580 --> 09:09.140
with business owners that are already paying,

09:09.140 --> 09:12.780
it's a much easier, more logical, quicker sale,

09:12.780 --> 09:13.820
because all you're doing is saying,

09:13.820 --> 09:15.740
look, you've already tried Home Advisor, dude,

09:15.740 --> 09:16.660
if it's not working,

09:16.660 --> 09:18.340
what makes you think it's gonna change?

09:18.340 --> 09:21.420
Why don't you try this with me, right?

09:21.420 --> 09:23.140
They're already in the mindset of the,

09:23.140 --> 09:25.220
hey, I gotta spend money to make money.

09:25.220 --> 09:26.860
It doesn't even mean you need to take the money

09:26.860 --> 09:29.140
from the Home Advisor budget necessarily,

09:29.140 --> 09:32.820
but there's somebody that's willing to spend money, okay?

09:32.820 --> 09:35.140
So here's a question that I wanna ask.

09:35.140 --> 09:36.300
I'm gonna ask Porter and Aaron,

09:36.300 --> 09:37.980
cause I'm sure that somebody is gonna ask this

09:37.980 --> 09:39.140
or thinking this.

09:39.140 --> 09:42.300
Aaron, you go to an area, everything looks good,

09:42.300 --> 09:46.100
juicy area, good lead flow, low competition,

09:46.100 --> 09:50.940
and there's only like, let's say three, four people

09:50.940 --> 09:52.620
that are paying for ads,

09:52.620 --> 09:54.660
paying for some kind of lead generation.

09:54.660 --> 09:55.480
What do you do?

09:56.360 --> 10:01.360
If I only see three or four people that are paying for leads,

10:02.520 --> 10:04.800
I would not go into that area.

10:06.440 --> 10:07.280
Porter, what about you?

10:07.280 --> 10:08.240
The reason being-

10:08.240 --> 10:10.400
Oh, finished, finished, finished.

10:10.400 --> 10:11.400
Oh yeah, no, I get it.

10:11.400 --> 10:13.600
So this is especially if you're starting out,

10:13.600 --> 10:16.380
like if you're not at 10K and I'm not at 10K,

10:16.380 --> 10:17.600
if you're not at 10K,

10:17.600 --> 10:19.560
these are not deals you should be pushing.

10:19.560 --> 10:20.380
Yeah, for sure.

10:20.380 --> 10:21.520
Like if you've got the sales experience,

10:21.520 --> 10:22.360
you got the conviction,

10:22.360 --> 10:25.480
you got the, like your systems are just dialed in,

10:25.480 --> 10:27.120
yeah, you could be, you might get that work,

10:27.120 --> 10:29.820
but that'd be like a higher skill deal to land.

10:29.820 --> 10:31.240
And again, you could land it,

10:31.240 --> 10:33.720
but you'll most likely get a better bang for your buck

10:33.720 --> 10:37.160
just going with an area of more people to prospect.

10:37.160 --> 10:38.640
Facts, yep.

10:38.640 --> 10:40.880
There's nothing worse than finally getting leads

10:40.880 --> 10:42.800
and then just not having prospects anymore.

10:42.800 --> 10:44.800
It's rare, but it happens and it sucks.

10:44.800 --> 10:48.320
100%, 100%.

10:48.320 --> 10:49.160
Porter?

10:50.040 --> 10:54.200
I think a lot of times if the metrics look good,

10:54.200 --> 10:56.080
I think all of us are like, dude, I don't care.

10:56.080 --> 10:57.680
Like there's gotta be a business owner.

10:57.680 --> 11:01.020
Like we all kind of jump on that city that looks good.

11:01.020 --> 11:02.280
So like if you do,

11:02.280 --> 11:04.080
there's probably some of you that are doing this right now,

11:04.080 --> 11:06.360
like go check and see if people are running ads.

11:06.360 --> 11:08.040
And if that is the case, I mean,

11:08.040 --> 11:10.240
you know your Google ads are your number one,

11:10.240 --> 11:12.000
your home advisor and your energy list

11:12.000 --> 11:13.720
is probably your two and three.

11:13.720 --> 11:15.140
And then anything after that,

11:15.140 --> 11:17.080
like you could dip into your Facebook groups,

11:17.080 --> 11:17.900
which I'm telling you,

11:18.460 --> 11:19.540
you're scraping the barrel.

11:19.540 --> 11:21.380
Like I've done that before and it's not worth it

11:21.380 --> 11:24.500
because I just lost two deals and that's exactly what I did.

11:24.500 --> 11:25.820
But if you're not doing that,

11:25.820 --> 11:27.460
you could also go to neighboring cities.

11:27.460 --> 11:28.580
If you're in a suburb area,

11:28.580 --> 11:31.500
you could go to a neighboring city that's close to it

11:31.500 --> 11:32.940
and search it.

11:32.940 --> 11:35.340
And maybe there's people running ads like 20 minutes away,

11:35.340 --> 11:39.140
which people love to travel if they got the work.

11:39.140 --> 11:40.540
But again, with Aaron,

11:40.540 --> 11:42.100
I think if you want to start off right,

11:42.100 --> 11:44.020
you don't necessarily want to target those areas.

11:44.020 --> 11:45.720
But again, I'm guilty of it.

11:45.720 --> 11:47.320
I still go into those areas sometimes

11:47.320 --> 11:49.720
because I'm like, dude, this is a golden area.

11:49.720 --> 11:50.800
This looks good.

11:50.800 --> 11:53.200
There's gotta be someone that wants the leads.

11:54.400 --> 11:56.280
I would say if you,

11:56.280 --> 11:59.720
I think that's a really good nuance that Aaron pointed out.

11:59.720 --> 12:01.360
And I agree with what Porter saying as well,

12:01.360 --> 12:04.120
that if you are not at least at a couple of deals,

12:04.120 --> 12:07.200
I'd say five, 10K, make it easy on yourself.

12:07.200 --> 12:09.760
Make sure there's five,

12:09.760 --> 12:11.840
I'd say maybe seven to 10 business owners

12:11.840 --> 12:14.160
that are paying for some form of advertising,

12:14.160 --> 12:17.680
whether it's, you know, ideally Google ads,

12:17.680 --> 12:20.580
then we go with HomeAdvisor, Andy's List, et cetera.

12:22.160 --> 12:26.200
Now, when, you know, after you've closed a bunch of deals,

12:26.200 --> 12:29.300
you're at 20K, 30K, 40K, there were areas,

12:29.300 --> 12:31.880
there was like two people that were paying for ads.

12:31.880 --> 12:35.140
I was going into that area because I knew my pitch so well.

12:35.140 --> 12:36.360
I had so much momentum.

12:36.360 --> 12:39.280
I had so many examples of, and better yet,

12:39.280 --> 12:40.840
it was like, I had franchised,

12:40.840 --> 12:43.200
people in franchises that were the same.

12:43.200 --> 12:44.840
Like I knew I was gonna get the deal,

12:44.840 --> 12:46.520
but I was in that niche.

12:46.520 --> 12:47.740
I was the expert in that niche.

12:47.740 --> 12:48.600
And so it's a little bit different.

12:48.600 --> 12:52.160
So if you guys are brand new, make it easy on yourself.

12:52.160 --> 12:55.080
Go into an area that has as many business owners

12:55.080 --> 12:56.680
as possible paying for some form of ads.

12:56.680 --> 12:58.160
Now, one more thing I wanna cover

12:58.160 --> 13:00.820
before we get into some of the Q&A stuff is,

13:02.640 --> 13:06.800
one, like for me, any form of paying for leads

13:06.800 --> 13:11.180
is better than none, but Google ads,

13:11.180 --> 13:13.780
the reason I like Google ads people the best

13:13.780 --> 13:16.820
is because they're usually spending the most money.

13:16.820 --> 13:20.280
And this is a question I hear people ask all the time.

13:20.280 --> 13:22.800
Well, why would they spend money with you

13:22.800 --> 13:25.300
when they're already paying for Google ads?

13:25.300 --> 13:26.220
Okay?

13:26.220 --> 13:30.180
Aaron smiling because he can literally speak just like me.

13:30.180 --> 13:32.380
Aaron, I know you're gonna say the perfect answer.

13:32.380 --> 13:33.820
Why is that?

13:33.820 --> 13:37.260
Why would they still spend money with you?

13:37.260 --> 13:39.020
There's a couple of reasons.

13:39.020 --> 13:40.900
One is it's better to have two fishing poles

13:40.900 --> 13:41.740
on the pond than one,

13:41.740 --> 13:43.620
because you're gonna catch more fish.

13:43.620 --> 13:45.340
Number two, just because they're getting clicks

13:45.340 --> 13:46.860
doesn't mean they're getting leads.

13:46.860 --> 13:48.540
They could be targeting,

13:48.540 --> 13:50.300
they have all their targeting settings off

13:50.300 --> 13:51.140
for what they want.

13:51.140 --> 13:55.520
They could have a landing page that doesn't convert,

13:56.420 --> 13:58.140
let alone, even if those things are true,

13:58.140 --> 14:01.620
again, what we're doing is if the ROI is still good,

14:01.620 --> 14:04.660
yeah, maybe their ROI isn't as high

14:04.660 --> 14:07.020
as if they get it from their own marketing source

14:07.020 --> 14:08.480
that they manage themselves,

14:08.480 --> 14:10.520
but it still makes sense if they make money from.

14:10.520 --> 14:13.380
So yeah, I used to think that too though.

14:13.380 --> 14:15.960
It's a fair question, but that's,

14:15.960 --> 14:17.720
if you guys are thinking that you're assuming

14:17.720 --> 14:19.360
that just because someone is running ads,

14:19.360 --> 14:21.000
you think they're getting leads.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.360
Google ads is to get clicks, not leads,

14:24.360 --> 14:26.360
that you pay for clicks, not for leads.

14:26.360 --> 14:27.960
The one advantage Home Advisor has

14:27.960 --> 14:29.640
is you're paying for leads, not clicks,

14:29.640 --> 14:30.780
except for you gotta share them.

14:30.780 --> 14:33.740
Guys, can't you see how much better of a service it is

14:33.740 --> 14:34.980
that we offer?

14:34.980 --> 14:37.600
Like it's, we're taking the good part of Home Advisor,

14:37.600 --> 14:39.440
we're taking the good part of Google,

14:39.440 --> 14:40.840
and we're giving both to them.

14:40.840 --> 14:43.560
It's exclusive because that's kind of what Google does,

14:43.560 --> 14:45.680
and it's leads, which is what Home Advisor does.

14:45.680 --> 14:48.520
And it's, they don't have to share it.

14:48.520 --> 14:50.160
I don't know, sometimes you have to go

14:50.160 --> 14:51.880
and you have to like put yourself in the shoes

14:51.880 --> 14:52.980
of the business owner and think about,

14:52.980 --> 14:54.240
imagine paying for Home Advisor.

14:54.240 --> 14:56.080
Imagine as an agency owner,

14:56.080 --> 14:59.240
you're paying Home Advisor for leads, right?

14:59.240 --> 15:00.800
And they send you a lead,

15:00.800 --> 15:02.760
and that lead is getting,

15:02.760 --> 15:05.820
they're sending that same lead to five other agencies,

15:05.820 --> 15:06.660
right?

15:06.660 --> 15:07.480
And guess what?

15:08.360 --> 15:09.200
One of these clients are looking for it,

15:09.200 --> 15:10.720
most likely is the cheapest price.

15:10.720 --> 15:13.120
And you're like, dude, I don't want to compete on price.

15:13.120 --> 15:14.240
It's not worth it for me.

15:14.240 --> 15:15.680
And then somebody else calls you and they're like,

15:15.680 --> 15:17.320
yo, I'm gonna send you these jobs.

15:17.320 --> 15:19.040
You're the only one I'm gonna send them to,

15:19.040 --> 15:22.040
that's your job to, like it's yours to lose,

15:22.040 --> 15:23.860
and I'm only gonna work with you.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.520
Dude, it's an easy sell.

15:26.520 --> 15:27.720
It's a very easy sell.

15:27.720 --> 15:32.720
So anyway, that's the biggest points I wanna cover.

15:32.760 --> 15:34.040
Guys, make it easy on yourself.

15:34.040 --> 15:35.300
The easier you make it on yourself,

15:35.300 --> 15:38.980
the more likely you're gonna be to actually,

15:38.980 --> 15:40.380
you know, just get the deal.

15:40.380 --> 15:43.820
And again, I know when you're starting out,

15:43.820 --> 15:46.620
it's easy to wanna jump into that first deal,

15:46.620 --> 15:48.660
find that first city and get started.

15:48.660 --> 15:50.540
And I love that energy.

15:50.540 --> 15:51.380
I love that energy.

15:51.380 --> 15:54.820
But guys, now that we have freaking rank and run engine

15:54.820 --> 15:58.920
where you can do a due diligence in like 13 seconds,

15:58.920 --> 16:01.880
you guys should be tearing through areas.

16:01.880 --> 16:03.660
You should be picking a niche

16:03.660 --> 16:05.800
and you should be picking a hundred cities

16:05.800 --> 16:08.580
and you should do the first 50 yourself,

16:08.580 --> 16:13.180
create a process, get an outsourcer from, you know,

16:13.180 --> 16:16.580
onlinejobs.ph and you should be cranking

16:16.580 --> 16:19.520
a hundred due diligence a day to find that city.

16:19.520 --> 16:23.940
And I would rather go a week to find the best city

16:23.940 --> 16:27.380
and, you know, maybe it takes you three extra days

16:27.380 --> 16:28.220
than what you were gonna do

16:28.220 --> 16:29.900
if you would have went with that okay city.

16:29.900 --> 16:32.020
Cause if you guys can find that right city and niche,

16:32.020 --> 16:35.140
dude, it makes every freaking thing easier

16:35.140 --> 16:37.740
and it's exciting, it's fun.

16:38.600 --> 16:40.860
So anyway, I can't stress enough about due diligence.

16:40.860 --> 16:42.180
And I think sometimes we're like,

16:42.180 --> 16:43.540
oh, I'm doing something wrong.

16:43.540 --> 16:45.620
But as Porter said in the beginning,

16:45.620 --> 16:47.980
most likely you're just talking to the wrong people.

16:47.980 --> 16:50.780
You could say the right thing to the wrong person

16:50.780 --> 16:52.140
and it's not gonna land.

16:54.660 --> 16:55.500
Makes sense?

16:55.500 --> 16:56.340
So true.

16:56.340 --> 16:59.180
And you can say the wrong things to the right person

16:59.180 --> 17:01.400
and it might still work.

17:01.400 --> 17:02.240
That's the truth.

17:02.240 --> 17:06.840
So I swear it's more about the person.

17:06.840 --> 17:08.800
So finding those right areas, number one,

17:08.800 --> 17:10.580
talking to the right people.

17:10.580 --> 17:11.960
And then I guess the last thing

17:11.960 --> 17:15.520
that we can talk about really quick is don't be so excited

17:15.520 --> 17:17.560
and salesy when someone says yes,

17:17.560 --> 17:19.960
be a little hesitant, pull back a little bit,

17:19.960 --> 17:21.800
be willing to lose the deal.

17:21.800 --> 17:24.040
If it feels a little off, be willing to say,

17:24.040 --> 17:25.960
hey, whoa, whoa, just so I can check

17:25.960 --> 17:27.280
before I send you this lead,

17:27.280 --> 17:29.140
but by the way is digital gold.

17:30.140 --> 17:32.820
I just wanna make sure you're hungry to grow here, sir.

17:32.820 --> 17:35.420
Cause I can only work with one company per area.

17:35.420 --> 17:39.900
I've had quite a bit of interest here in Tucson.

17:39.900 --> 17:44.660
And before I dedicate and kind of like marry myself to you,

17:44.660 --> 17:47.380
like, can you just give me a little bit of a feedback

17:47.380 --> 17:49.620
as to why, how I'm convinced me

17:49.620 --> 17:50.980
that you're serious about growing.

17:50.980 --> 17:52.540
Cause I don't wanna waste my time either.

17:52.540 --> 17:55.180
I'm running a business just like you, right?

17:55.180 --> 17:56.020
Don't be afraid.

17:56.020 --> 17:57.300
People are so afraid that if they say that,

17:57.300 --> 17:58.900
they're gonna lose the deal.

17:58.900 --> 18:00.700
All that's gonna do is help you get the deal.

18:00.700 --> 18:01.640
It's gonna build trust

18:01.640 --> 18:04.460
because you're not so freaking desperate to get that deal.

18:04.460 --> 18:07.700
So anyway, let's go into a little bit of Q and A.

18:07.700 --> 18:09.220
We can kind of mix in some other stuff

18:09.220 --> 18:10.780
that comes to our minds as we go.

18:10.780 --> 18:15.780
But guys, who you talk to is more important

18:16.260 --> 18:17.820
than what you say.

18:17.820 --> 18:19.000
I promise you that.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.480
If you are talking to the right person that's hungry,

18:21.480 --> 18:23.100
you can mess up a lot of the other stuff.

18:23.100 --> 18:24.060
You're still gonna get the deal.

18:24.060 --> 18:27.380
On the contrary, you go pick some random Joe off the street

18:27.380 --> 18:28.380
that's in a Facebook group

18:28.380 --> 18:29.900
that's not willing to spend 10 cents.

18:29.900 --> 18:31.460
You could say all the right things.

18:31.460 --> 18:34.260
The money's just not there or the mindset's just not there.

18:34.260 --> 18:35.300
It's just not gonna work.

18:35.300 --> 18:37.220
It is so important you're talking to the right people.

18:37.220 --> 18:38.940
And so that's why we stress so much.

18:38.940 --> 18:39.860
Go and sell.

18:39.860 --> 18:42.380
That's why the module is called Selling to the Already Sold.

18:42.380 --> 18:43.780
Building your list.

18:43.780 --> 18:45.780
Do we have any questions so far, Aaron?

18:47.220 --> 18:49.240
So we don't have any specific questions,

18:49.240 --> 18:51.240
but one good comment from Brad Hardy.

18:51.240 --> 18:53.420
This was in reference to the question

18:53.420 --> 18:55.540
of why would a business wanna pay me

18:55.540 --> 18:57.060
if they're already paying for Google Ads themselves.

18:57.740 --> 18:59.380
But he said, they're busy doing the work.

18:59.380 --> 19:01.300
They aren't watching the ads.

19:01.300 --> 19:02.140
At all.

19:02.140 --> 19:03.060
Bingo, like if we just zoom out,

19:03.060 --> 19:05.160
sometimes we as marketers start a full-time job.

19:05.160 --> 19:08.200
Sometimes we're not as focused on particular projects

19:08.200 --> 19:10.580
or ad campaigns as we need to be.

19:10.580 --> 19:11.580
So I don't know who doesn't know what we're doing.

19:11.580 --> 19:12.900
So probably doesn't even wanna do it anyway

19:12.900 --> 19:15.580
because they're like, they got that mental friction of like,

19:15.580 --> 19:16.540
ah, I don't even know what I'm doing.

19:16.540 --> 19:17.580
Why do you even bother?

19:17.580 --> 19:18.660
So yeah.

19:18.660 --> 19:19.500
Yep.

19:19.500 --> 19:21.500
I completely agree with that.

19:21.500 --> 19:23.100
You guys think for one second,

19:23.100 --> 19:25.220
I mean, these people are worried about everything

19:25.220 --> 19:29.100
from their cell phone bill to their company t-shirt,

19:29.100 --> 19:32.300
to their insurance, to the gas.

19:32.300 --> 19:34.180
What they did is they went to a conference,

19:34.180 --> 19:35.380
they heard their buddy.

19:36.700 --> 19:38.940
If they were lucky, they hired their niece

19:38.940 --> 19:41.500
who's taking a marketing class in college,

19:41.500 --> 19:44.500
marketing 101, learning from a professor

19:44.500 --> 19:47.780
that makes like 40 grand a year, that's never done ads.

19:47.780 --> 19:49.820
And that's who's running their ads.

19:49.820 --> 19:51.620
So be a little persistent, guys.

19:51.620 --> 19:52.940
By the way, you said there was a question

19:52.940 --> 19:54.100
on the original post, Aaron?

19:54.140 --> 19:55.780
Did we already answer that?

19:57.620 --> 19:59.980
No, that was Heather's comment talking about,

19:59.980 --> 20:01.180
she's glad this was the topic

20:01.180 --> 20:03.100
because this is one of her main roadblocks.

20:03.100 --> 20:04.540
Now with that, I would say,

20:04.540 --> 20:07.220
and we can probably talk about this a bit as well,

20:07.220 --> 20:08.420
is, and if you guys have questions,

20:08.420 --> 20:09.900
you can drop them in the comments.

20:09.900 --> 20:12.620
With qualifying, it seems like there's three times,

20:12.620 --> 20:14.460
like three different stages in the sales process

20:14.460 --> 20:16.580
where people fall off, like usually,

20:16.580 --> 20:18.500
and this is usually because either we messed up

20:18.500 --> 20:21.220
with our sales pitch or approach,

20:21.220 --> 20:23.820
or because they were just a bad prospect to begin with.

20:24.660 --> 20:26.540
And that's usually one of those two reasons.

20:26.540 --> 20:28.180
And by the way, when in doubt, blame yourself,

20:28.180 --> 20:30.500
just little advice for life.

20:30.500 --> 20:33.020
But anyway, I was gonna say that,

20:33.020 --> 20:34.740
it looks like she said that particularly,

20:34.740 --> 20:37.180
she's struggling with, she'll cold call them,

20:37.180 --> 20:39.020
she'll get a yes, but then they fall off

20:39.020 --> 20:40.340
after she sends a few leads.

20:40.340 --> 20:42.740
So it gets ghosted before the Zoom call.

20:42.740 --> 20:44.900
That's like stage one of bad qualifying,

20:44.900 --> 20:46.580
like second stage, it seems like,

20:46.580 --> 20:48.420
would be where you hop on the Zoom close,

20:48.420 --> 20:50.820
and then there's just something that they throw at,

20:50.820 --> 20:53.540
that's just clearly they're not a good fit.

20:54.300 --> 20:55.700
So I was talking with an illegal immigrant

20:55.700 --> 20:57.100
on a close call at one point,

20:57.100 --> 20:58.620
didn't really work out one of those things,

20:58.620 --> 21:00.540
that bad qualifying job.

21:00.540 --> 21:02.540
And then finally, number three would be like,

21:02.540 --> 21:04.300
as you were talking to me about,

21:04.300 --> 21:05.780
is if they're, you got the deal,

21:05.780 --> 21:07.380
but they're just not handling the leads well,

21:07.380 --> 21:09.660
because they don't, and then they just,

21:09.660 --> 21:11.940
they fall off because of that, if that kind of makes sense.

21:11.940 --> 21:14.140
So like before the call, during the call,

21:14.140 --> 21:16.180
and then after the sale.

21:16.180 --> 21:18.140
100%.

21:18.140 --> 21:21.860
Let's talk about when you're getting ghosted,

21:21.860 --> 21:23.820
because I know this is a pretty like,

21:23.820 --> 21:26.820
okay, so you build the list properly, boom,

21:26.820 --> 21:29.820
there's seven to 10 people, you got your pitch dialed in,

21:29.820 --> 21:34.020
you get the deal hooked, and let's just say,

21:34.020 --> 21:36.940
let's talk with, let me ask Porter first.

21:36.940 --> 21:39.660
So Porter, you get them, they're excited,

21:39.660 --> 21:41.540
yeah, sounds good, send me a couple of leads,

21:41.540 --> 21:45.180
boom, you hang up the phone, and first scenario,

21:45.180 --> 21:47.020
first circumstance is,

21:47.020 --> 21:49.100
they never answer the phone again after that, right?

21:49.100 --> 21:50.260
You haven't sent them any leads,

21:50.260 --> 21:51.940
they're just kind of ghost after that.

21:51.940 --> 21:54.220
What do you learn from that, what can we,

21:54.220 --> 21:56.180
what can you do, and what can you learn from that?

21:56.180 --> 21:58.460
If you get somebody hooked,

21:58.460 --> 21:59.740
and then they never answer the phone,

21:59.740 --> 22:01.420
you never send them a lead, you try to send them a lead,

22:01.420 --> 22:03.180
but they just ghost.

22:05.660 --> 22:07.580
This happened a lot when I first started out,

22:07.580 --> 22:10.380
and I do, and I don't know if this is 100% the reason why,

22:10.380 --> 22:13.580
but I felt like I was saying too much on the first call.

22:13.580 --> 22:17.140
I was, you could always add more information to them,

22:17.140 --> 22:18.080
but you can never take away.

22:18.080 --> 22:20.680
So as soon as you start talking about SEO, backlinking,

22:20.680 --> 22:22.680
you being able to rank these websites,

22:22.680 --> 22:25.360
these guys are like, what the crap did you just say?

22:25.360 --> 22:27.320
And then they get all weirded out by it.

22:27.320 --> 22:30.000
So I felt like I was saying too much to the point where

22:30.000 --> 22:32.640
I was trying to sell them on the first call,

22:32.640 --> 22:34.920
and so I stopped doing that.

22:34.920 --> 22:37.960
I stick exactly to the script, I do the bare minimum,

22:37.960 --> 22:39.640
and then I can always add onto that.

22:39.640 --> 22:41.520
But if someone was to ghost me,

22:41.520 --> 22:43.240
I mean, that's where the pullback,

22:43.240 --> 22:45.520
you have to be like, dude, it's okay,

22:45.560 --> 22:48.200
I have the fear of no loss, whatever,

22:48.200 --> 22:50.760
give them the pullback, say, hey, Mr. Business Owner,

22:50.760 --> 22:52.240
I understand you're busy,

22:52.240 --> 22:54.560
but I am trying to run a business as well.

22:54.560 --> 22:55.680
If you're interested in these leads,

22:55.680 --> 22:58.000
message me back by the end of the day, if not,

22:58.000 --> 23:01.400
I will start sending these to somebody else, thanks.

23:01.400 --> 23:02.660
Something along those lines,

23:02.660 --> 23:04.880
and if they are interested, they will come back,

23:04.880 --> 23:07.280
and if they're not, then just move on.

23:07.280 --> 23:09.980
I wouldn't even be emotional about it.

23:11.040 --> 23:12.880
100%.

23:12.880 --> 23:14.720
In the training, we talk about this again.

23:15.280 --> 23:17.680
Sorry to keep going back to the training,

23:17.680 --> 23:19.840
but I'm gonna go back to the training, right?

23:19.840 --> 23:22.560
Which is, you remember the example I used, guys,

23:22.560 --> 23:26.000
we're selling a date or dinner, not marriage, right?

23:26.000 --> 23:28.720
We're not going in, frickin' first time meeting a chick,

23:28.720 --> 23:29.880
and then we're like talking about marriage.

23:29.880 --> 23:31.240
That's when people get weird, dude.

23:31.240 --> 23:33.720
They're like, yo, I'm never talking to this guy again,

23:33.720 --> 23:34.960
right, that's weird.

23:34.960 --> 23:37.600
Unless it's your boy, I'm closing that thing first date.

23:37.600 --> 23:40.160
Everybody else cannot do that, okay?

23:40.160 --> 23:41.160
No, I'm just kidding.

23:41.160 --> 23:44.520
So I saw this happen in door-to-door sales.

23:44.520 --> 23:45.760
Porter had a good point.

23:46.760 --> 23:49.660
I would see this happen with new reps all the time.

23:51.160 --> 23:52.280
Can you guys still hear me, by the way?

23:52.280 --> 23:54.160
I was a little choppy, I'm sorry.

23:54.160 --> 23:55.000
Good?

23:55.000 --> 23:58.600
All right, so new reps, when they first started,

23:58.600 --> 24:01.120
including me, we'd give them a pitch,

24:01.120 --> 24:02.480
and it was a four-step pitch.

24:02.480 --> 24:05.620
Who you are, why you're there, the deal,

24:05.620 --> 24:08.240
and the transition, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, okay?

24:08.240 --> 24:11.080
And every time you teach them the simple pitch,

24:11.080 --> 24:12.300
they do it, they get in the house,

24:12.300 --> 24:14.160
they get their first deal, maybe five deals,

24:14.800 --> 24:15.840
and then all of a sudden they'd stop closing,

24:15.840 --> 24:18.640
they'd go into slump fest, okay?

24:18.640 --> 24:21.840
And every single time you would go with these reps,

24:21.840 --> 24:24.720
you would find out they were just vomiting information

24:24.720 --> 24:26.040
on the door, right?

24:26.040 --> 24:29.280
They were jumping ahead and skipping steps.

24:29.280 --> 24:30.960
And I like what Porter said, he's like,

24:30.960 --> 24:33.120
you can always give them more, you can't take it away,

24:33.120 --> 24:35.440
and there's a quote that says something like,

24:35.440 --> 24:38.380
the man that doesn't talk can never be misquoted.

24:38.380 --> 24:43.380
Just in sales, sometimes more is less and less is more.

24:43.380 --> 24:45.940
Be very succinct about what you have to say,

24:45.940 --> 24:47.060
but don't over-talk.

24:47.060 --> 24:48.300
They start asking you questions.

24:48.300 --> 24:49.220
This is common, right?

24:49.220 --> 24:50.580
We get our first couple of deals,

24:50.580 --> 24:51.780
and then the business owner's like,

24:51.780 --> 24:52.620
dude, but just tell me,

24:52.620 --> 24:54.420
how much are we looking right now?

24:54.420 --> 24:57.420
And you're like, well, and you just drop price, right?

24:57.420 --> 25:00.220
There's a reason we do it in the order that we do it,

25:00.220 --> 25:02.660
or they'll say, so yeah, dude,

25:02.660 --> 25:04.740
I'm happy to do 10% split.

25:04.740 --> 25:06.620
And instead of you going,

25:06.620 --> 25:08.380
hey, let's not worry about that right now,

25:08.380 --> 25:10.340
and explaining it on the screencast,

25:10.340 --> 25:11.740
and at the end, you're like,

25:11.740 --> 25:14.300
nope, the only thing that I do is flat fee.

25:14.300 --> 25:15.140
And then all of a sudden,

25:15.140 --> 25:16.500
the business owner doesn't understand

25:16.500 --> 25:18.260
why the flat fees make sense,

25:18.260 --> 25:21.220
and all they're gonna do is just ghost you.

25:21.220 --> 25:24.120
So do not freaking skip steps.

25:24.120 --> 25:25.380
Keep it simple.

25:25.380 --> 25:27.300
Less is more, more is less.

25:27.300 --> 25:28.860
Talk to the right business owners.

25:28.860 --> 25:33.860
You just guide them through the process, okay?

25:33.860 --> 25:36.980
Also, let's talk about the second situation, Aaron.

25:36.980 --> 25:38.580
We hook a business owner.

25:38.580 --> 25:41.260
We, you know, sounds good to get a couple of leads.

25:41.260 --> 25:42.620
You send them two, three leads.

25:42.620 --> 25:44.340
This one's the most painful.

25:44.340 --> 25:47.780
You send them two to three leads, and then they ghost you.

25:47.780 --> 25:50.020
What can we learn from that?

25:50.020 --> 25:51.620
What do you do in that situation?

25:53.440 --> 25:55.460
Yeah, it seems like when that happens,

25:55.460 --> 25:57.700
it's gonna either come down to

25:57.700 --> 26:00.140
they were innately not a good fit,

26:00.140 --> 26:03.460
or again, you messed up somewhere along the process.

26:03.460 --> 26:04.340
And I'm gonna be honest,

26:04.340 --> 26:06.880
it is really hard to tell sometimes with those situations,

26:06.880 --> 26:08.260
because then you're thinking like,

26:08.260 --> 26:09.420
well, did I say something?

26:09.420 --> 26:11.340
Should I have said something else?

26:11.340 --> 26:13.660
There's just a lot of variables at play.

26:13.660 --> 26:18.220
And usually, obviously, you first wanna look at yourself

26:18.220 --> 26:20.380
and, okay, did I say too much?

26:20.380 --> 26:23.020
As you talk about your new reps, your sales guys,

26:23.020 --> 26:25.300
like they're probably giving too much information.

26:25.300 --> 26:26.940
So it could have been on your end.

26:28.220 --> 26:29.500
And if you can't find anything,

26:29.500 --> 26:30.860
then you can kind of begin to think,

26:30.860 --> 26:33.900
okay, well, is this business owner just not a good fit?

26:33.900 --> 26:36.700
But, and sometimes it seems like there are businesses

26:36.700 --> 26:38.980
that have just been burned so bad

26:38.980 --> 26:40.480
by other marketing companies

26:40.480 --> 26:42.980
that they're just completely closed off.

26:42.980 --> 26:43.900
It makes it kind of weird

26:43.900 --> 26:45.580
that they would take a couple of leads,

26:45.580 --> 26:47.980
but some just don't trust you.

26:47.980 --> 26:50.100
Nothing you do can make them trust you,

26:50.100 --> 26:52.100
even sometimes when giving free leads,

26:52.100 --> 26:52.940
it almost seems like,

26:52.940 --> 26:54.460
where they just don't believe it.

26:54.460 --> 26:56.220
And again, that might be where you might need

26:56.220 --> 26:58.260
to be a bit more persuasive in your approach, perhaps,

26:58.260 --> 27:00.600
but that one's a bit more dicey.

27:00.600 --> 27:01.500
Yeah.

27:01.500 --> 27:03.820
And that's where the only thing you can do

27:03.820 --> 27:05.180
in a situation like that,

27:05.180 --> 27:06.600
if you're literally getting ghosted,

27:07.500 --> 27:08.460
is you have to just take control back.

27:08.460 --> 27:10.560
You have to take the deal off the table

27:10.560 --> 27:14.960
and you have to have some huevos

27:14.960 --> 27:17.120
and you have to send the text.

27:17.120 --> 27:18.400
You have to send the text.

27:18.400 --> 27:19.240
That's it.

27:19.240 --> 27:21.700
So, and we've talked about length.

27:21.700 --> 27:23.760
I'm sure there's three different lives we've had

27:23.760 --> 27:26.020
inside this group on the pullback, right?

27:26.020 --> 27:29.000
The breakup text, that thing is money.

27:29.000 --> 27:30.600
It's a little bit scary in the beginning.

27:30.600 --> 27:33.420
And it's always like, you're, you know,

27:33.420 --> 27:35.060
and the best part is when sometimes you send

27:35.060 --> 27:36.700
the breakup text and the business owner

27:36.700 --> 27:39.860
tries to make you feel bad, like, well, I'm not,

27:39.860 --> 27:41.620
you lost me at that.

27:41.620 --> 27:42.460
You lost me.

27:42.460 --> 27:44.820
And it's like, bro, shut up.

27:44.820 --> 27:46.500
You guys have had this, right?

27:47.420 --> 27:48.260
Oh yeah.

27:48.260 --> 27:49.100
Yeah.

27:49.100 --> 27:49.920
I've never done that.

27:49.920 --> 27:51.580
And even if they did, those are the type of people

27:51.580 --> 27:52.960
that cancel after week three

27:52.960 --> 27:54.780
because the leads were slow that week.

27:54.780 --> 27:55.820
Yeah.

27:55.820 --> 27:56.780
A hundred percent.

27:56.780 --> 28:01.780
Guys, I'm at a point in my life and in business especially,

28:02.540 --> 28:03.760
but if there's a relationship,

28:03.760 --> 28:05.560
whether it's a business relationship, a friendship,

28:05.560 --> 28:08.920
whatever, and people get like,

28:08.920 --> 28:10.680
if I can tell they're gonna be difficult

28:10.680 --> 28:14.040
and high maintenance, and it's gonna take me a lot to make,

28:14.040 --> 28:16.780
like, I meet a new friend and it's like,

28:16.780 --> 28:17.880
they get offended easy, dude.

28:17.880 --> 28:18.720
It's not my friend, bro.

28:18.720 --> 28:20.440
Like, I just don't have the energy.

28:20.440 --> 28:21.680
If I meet a business owner,

28:21.680 --> 28:23.060
I don't care what you're willing to give me.

28:23.060 --> 28:25.680
I used to be the guy, and maybe you guys wanna do this.

28:25.680 --> 28:30.520
I used to call, I would call it an a-hole tax.

28:30.520 --> 28:31.360
So I would be like, okay,

28:31.360 --> 28:33.020
this person's gonna be a difficult,

28:33.020 --> 28:35.180
they're gonna kind of be an a-hole.

28:35.180 --> 28:36.500
I'm gonna charge them extra.

28:36.500 --> 28:37.980
And if they do it, I'll still work with them.

28:37.980 --> 28:39.580
And I would put up with quite a bit

28:39.580 --> 28:41.380
because I wanted the money.

28:41.380 --> 28:43.540
And even now, I just won't do that, dude.

28:43.540 --> 28:46.260
If somebody's difficult with, like, I just won't.

28:46.260 --> 28:49.860
Like, we've had, we've had students, dude.

28:49.860 --> 28:52.420
We've had students that, like, we can just tell,

28:52.420 --> 28:54.540
and we're like, yeah, it's not worth it.

28:54.540 --> 28:57.480
Go your merry way, you're not worth anything.

28:57.480 --> 28:59.280
And it's just, no amount of money is worth it.

28:59.280 --> 29:01.220
So keep that in mind, guys,

29:01.220 --> 29:04.100
is if somebody's difficult in the beginning,

29:04.100 --> 29:06.580
they're probably gonna be difficult throughout.

29:06.580 --> 29:08.580
And depending on what you're,

29:08.580 --> 29:10.740
like, you'll get what you tolerate.

29:10.740 --> 29:12.700
And I won't tolerate much at this point, right?

29:12.700 --> 29:13.900
I know what I'm worth.

29:13.900 --> 29:15.260
I know I'm valuable.

29:15.260 --> 29:19.020
And my tolerance has gone completely down.

29:19.020 --> 29:20.100
It's very low.

29:20.100 --> 29:23.480
I have a very low tolerance for a bunch of weird people

29:23.480 --> 29:25.780
that I'm just not interested in talking to.

29:25.780 --> 29:28.020
So just be choosy, dude.

29:28.020 --> 29:31.300
It's your business, it's your clients.

29:31.300 --> 29:32.700
You get to choose who you work with.

29:32.700 --> 29:34.140
You get to choose the price.

29:34.140 --> 29:35.820
You get to choose how you do business.

29:35.820 --> 29:38.560
You get to, it's literally how you build it

29:38.560 --> 29:40.380
and what you're willing to tolerate and accept.

29:40.380 --> 29:42.740
And that's the beautiful thing about it, okay?

29:42.740 --> 29:46.160
So biggest takeaway I'm gonna say from qualifying

29:46.160 --> 29:51.080
is it's most likely an issue with who you're talking to,

29:51.080 --> 29:53.060
not an issue with what you're saying.

29:53.060 --> 29:54.700
In sales, most of the time,

29:54.700 --> 29:56.880
if you're losing someone at a certain step,

29:56.880 --> 29:58.960
it's the step before, right?

29:58.960 --> 30:00.840
If you're losing them when you're trying to get,

30:00.840 --> 30:02.560
when you're cold calling, trying to do the hook

30:02.560 --> 30:04.120
and you're not hooking anyone,

30:04.120 --> 30:06.820
usually because you're talking to the wrong people, right?

30:06.820 --> 30:09.840
If you're losing them, when you're sending them leads,

30:09.840 --> 30:12.600
usually when you did the hook, you oversold it,

30:12.600 --> 30:15.720
you said too much, whatever, you freaked them out.

30:15.720 --> 30:18.160
It's usually the one or two steps before.

30:18.160 --> 30:20.400
So you're not closing the deal,

30:20.400 --> 30:22.800
you usually didn't do the setup correctly, right?

30:22.800 --> 30:24.640
Which by the way, starts from the moment you call

30:24.640 --> 30:26.480
to the moment that you close the deal.

30:26.960 --> 30:29.800
Any other comments, any other questions that people have?

30:29.800 --> 30:31.600
Yeah, we got some comments that started rolling.

30:31.600 --> 30:34.080
And so real quick, this is just, we can address this.

30:34.080 --> 30:37.360
Corey Gilbert said, if I got 80 clicks and only five leads,

30:37.360 --> 30:39.000
is that a good ratio?

30:39.000 --> 30:40.120
I think that's 16%.

30:40.120 --> 30:42.840
I was trying to do the calculation while you're talking.

30:42.840 --> 30:45.400
So 16% like click to lead ratio.

30:45.400 --> 30:46.680
I think that sounds pretty good to me,

30:46.680 --> 30:48.720
depending on the niche, I guess, right?

30:48.720 --> 30:50.640
If it's plumbing, it's probably pretty bad.

30:50.640 --> 30:53.440
If it's basement waterproofing,

30:53.440 --> 30:55.960
that's a good conversion right there.

30:56.960 --> 31:00.000
Okay, so let's see.

31:01.000 --> 31:01.840
Corey made the comment,

31:01.840 --> 31:04.360
I don't see how rare is faster with DD.

31:04.360 --> 31:06.240
So Corey, I don't know if you've like ever done

31:06.240 --> 31:09.360
a market research like template on your own,

31:09.360 --> 31:13.080
like Google Sheets, like kind of in the original training,

31:13.080 --> 31:16.000
but it takes a long while to go over the individual backlinks

31:16.000 --> 31:16.840
and everything,

31:16.840 --> 31:19.040
because you're able to just put in one thing.

31:20.080 --> 31:21.120
Yeah, I don't-

31:21.120 --> 31:23.720
You should go try, what you should do is go to,

31:23.720 --> 31:25.400
I think in the training,

31:25.400 --> 31:27.240
we talk about like how to do the due diligence

31:27.240 --> 31:28.400
with the sheet.

31:28.400 --> 31:31.080
Go and open up a Google Sheet

31:31.080 --> 31:34.320
and go and copy and paste everything in.

31:34.320 --> 31:35.960
Look at the backlinks,

31:35.960 --> 31:38.200
go and find the age of the domain.

31:38.200 --> 31:39.880
Get a White Spark account and get a-

31:39.880 --> 31:42.640
Get a White Spark, go do all of that.

31:42.640 --> 31:44.160
Yeah, go time it.

31:44.160 --> 31:46.320
It's way faster.

31:46.320 --> 31:49.360
It's probably four or five times faster

31:49.360 --> 31:50.200
to do it on due diligence.

31:50.200 --> 31:51.520
You're probably comparing,

31:51.520 --> 31:53.000
I think you're just comparing that to,

31:53.680 --> 31:55.240
I don't think there's any other comparison.

31:55.240 --> 31:56.920
Go try and do it manually.

31:56.920 --> 31:57.920
And by the way,

31:57.920 --> 31:59.800
for those of you that don't want to use Rankin Energy,

31:59.800 --> 32:01.760
you don't have to use it by all means.

32:01.760 --> 32:03.840
I did my first, not thousand,

32:03.840 --> 32:06.200
but probably my first hundred due diligence,

32:06.200 --> 32:07.480
not even using the template.

32:07.480 --> 32:09.600
I used to print the pages off

32:09.600 --> 32:11.560
and I would write them physically out.

32:11.560 --> 32:13.160
And I had this stack of due diligence

32:13.160 --> 32:14.760
and I would sit there and I would spend

32:14.760 --> 32:16.360
three, four hours sometimes in a day,

32:16.360 --> 32:19.120
just looking at cities, just clicking through cities,

32:19.120 --> 32:21.600
copy and paste and clearing my browser history.

32:21.600 --> 32:22.960
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

32:22.960 --> 32:24.480
Okay, yep, yep, yep.

32:24.480 --> 32:26.440
And the other problem with that guys is you're human

32:26.440 --> 32:27.960
so you're not going to see as much stuff.

32:27.960 --> 32:29.240
You might read it wrong,

32:29.240 --> 32:30.640
like all these different variables.

32:30.640 --> 32:32.080
You don't have to use that tool.

32:32.080 --> 32:34.040
But what I was saying with my point being

32:34.040 --> 32:36.840
with using Rankin Engine is that

32:36.840 --> 32:39.680
if I could save even five minutes

32:39.680 --> 32:41.960
and I'm doing 20 due diligence,

32:41.960 --> 32:44.200
dude, I mean, I just saved myself what?

32:44.200 --> 32:45.880
Over an hour, almost two hours,

32:45.880 --> 32:46.920
hour and 40 minutes.

32:46.920 --> 32:48.560
Like that's insane, right?

32:48.560 --> 32:51.440
And I know you're saving 15 minutes per due diligence.

32:52.280 --> 32:53.120
So anyway, sometimes there's no context.

32:53.120 --> 32:54.440
Go do one manually.

32:54.440 --> 32:55.680
But even if you don't want to,

32:55.680 --> 32:58.160
then just use the regular sheet.

32:58.160 --> 32:59.840
The point is you got to put in the reps.

32:59.840 --> 33:02.320
And the reason I know how to look at a good area

33:02.320 --> 33:04.760
is because I've literally done over a thousand myself.

33:04.760 --> 33:06.840
So I know when an area, even if it looks good,

33:06.840 --> 33:07.800
oh, that thing's off.

33:07.800 --> 33:10.080
This looks like that one time that I tried it.

33:10.080 --> 33:12.800
And then, so as much as I want to train

33:12.800 --> 33:13.840
and as much I want to show you,

33:13.840 --> 33:15.560
it does take you doing reps to figure it out.

33:15.560 --> 33:16.840
But great question, Cory.

33:18.080 --> 33:19.080
Yeah, and for the record,

33:19.080 --> 33:21.000
the reason it took Nick four years to scale

33:21.560 --> 33:23.960
was because he was doing his due diligence on paper

33:23.960 --> 33:25.320
in the 21st century.

33:25.320 --> 33:26.680
Just throwing that out there.

33:26.680 --> 33:27.640
All right.

33:27.640 --> 33:31.760
That's just a small example of a much larger problem.

33:31.760 --> 33:34.040
I was doing everything in my business.

33:34.040 --> 33:36.840
Old school, slow, I'm doing it myself.

33:36.840 --> 33:38.200
I'm writing my own content.

33:38.200 --> 33:40.240
Like I was not going to let go of sales.

33:40.240 --> 33:41.840
I didn't know how to scale.

33:41.840 --> 33:44.840
And finally in 2020, I was like, okay, let's go.

33:44.840 --> 33:46.520
But yeah, good point.

33:46.520 --> 33:47.360
That's right.

33:47.360 --> 33:48.680
So Jason, great question.

33:48.680 --> 33:49.840
Will there be a module

33:49.840 --> 33:51.920
where we can look over your shoulder

33:51.920 --> 33:54.240
doing due diligence in R&R engine?

33:54.240 --> 33:55.400
We aren't rank and rent engine.

33:55.400 --> 33:58.800
We are working on redoing the due diligence training.

33:58.800 --> 33:59.640
Of course.

33:59.640 --> 34:02.200
And by the way, we are going to be using

34:02.200 --> 34:04.520
the rank and rent engine tool

34:04.520 --> 34:06.600
with the new training as the go-to tool.

34:06.600 --> 34:07.920
Because I know in our original one,

34:07.920 --> 34:09.400
I used a couple of different tools

34:09.400 --> 34:10.720
and I kind of said use whatever.

34:10.720 --> 34:12.080
It's easier if I can just use one.

34:12.080 --> 34:13.840
In this one, we have control over.

34:13.840 --> 34:16.640
We trust at least to a certain extent

34:16.640 --> 34:19.600
because we can only trust Google's data they give us.

34:20.360 --> 34:22.880
But yes, that's going to be part of it for sure.

34:22.880 --> 34:24.280
So just as a heads up,

34:24.280 --> 34:25.600
we might have something even released

34:25.600 --> 34:26.920
a little sooner than that.

34:26.920 --> 34:28.120
Kind of give you guys some snippets.

34:28.120 --> 34:29.200
You have to wait for everything to come out.

34:29.200 --> 34:30.320
But yes, that's a really good question.

34:30.320 --> 34:31.160
Jason, all red?

34:32.280 --> 34:34.400
No, that was Jason Adam.

34:34.400 --> 34:35.360
Okay, great.

34:35.360 --> 34:36.200
What's up, Jason?

34:36.200 --> 34:37.160
Yeah.

34:37.160 --> 34:38.000
That's right.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.360
So real quick, let me see this question.

34:42.240 --> 34:43.080
Okay, yeah.

34:43.080 --> 34:44.640
Joe says, hey guys, new to the group.

34:44.640 --> 34:46.840
So Joe, let me get back to you that in just a second.

34:46.840 --> 34:49.200
I'm going to try to answer any qualifying questions

34:49.760 --> 34:50.600
that a lot of people are having

34:50.600 --> 34:52.280
rank and run engine questions.

34:52.280 --> 34:53.480
Let me see.

34:53.480 --> 34:56.720
Also, real quick, there's a, what's the code?

34:56.720 --> 34:59.200
Somebody had a couple of people message me.

34:59.200 --> 35:01.040
Can you, can someone post the chat?

35:01.040 --> 35:06.040
The code for the discount is capital land.

35:08.040 --> 35:10.280
It's all caps landlord 24.

35:11.400 --> 35:12.240
Okay.

35:12.240 --> 35:13.080
You want to drive that?

35:13.080 --> 35:13.920
You can put that in there.

35:13.920 --> 35:14.760
I'm looking through the comments.

35:14.760 --> 35:16.920
Porter, can you put that in?

35:16.920 --> 35:17.920
Yep.

35:17.920 --> 35:18.760
All caps.

35:18.760 --> 35:20.360
This for digital landlord students.

35:20.360 --> 35:21.200
Correct.

35:21.200 --> 35:24.400
Landlord, all caps, landlord, one word, 24, no spaces.

35:24.400 --> 35:27.160
That's for, I think 20% off for the first two months.

35:27.160 --> 35:30.120
Again, guys, use whatever you want to use.

35:30.120 --> 35:31.960
You don't have to use anything.

35:31.960 --> 35:34.680
If you can get around and you can plug this and plug that,

35:34.680 --> 35:35.520
you don't have to.

35:35.520 --> 35:36.400
We're just trying to make this

35:36.400 --> 35:38.840
as easy as possible for you guys.

35:38.840 --> 35:43.240
And for me, if I can go and I can save two hours a day,

35:43.240 --> 35:45.680
look at 20 more due diligence,

35:45.680 --> 35:48.360
maybe find one or two extra good cities,

35:48.960 --> 35:50.920
that one or two cities every day times five days

35:50.920 --> 35:54.040
times fourth weeks, times 12 months.

35:54.040 --> 35:56.240
Dude, I'm light years ahead.

35:56.240 --> 35:57.400
But sometimes when you start,

35:57.400 --> 36:00.040
you're just thinking about, you know, whatever.

36:00.040 --> 36:01.720
You're thinking about, I'm going to do this manually,

36:01.720 --> 36:02.560
which is fine.

36:02.560 --> 36:03.840
Go do it manually and then you'll appreciate it later.

36:03.840 --> 36:06.880
So, but yeah, landlord 24 is the code.

36:06.880 --> 36:07.960
What other questions?

36:08.840 --> 36:09.680
Yeah.

36:09.680 --> 36:10.520
So Julia has a really good question.

36:10.520 --> 36:12.320
Says, what are the main questions you asked

36:12.320 --> 36:14.960
during prospecting, live transfers and following up?

36:14.960 --> 36:16.680
If you guys already answered this, it's no problem.

36:16.680 --> 36:17.960
I'll just rewatch the live.

36:18.600 --> 36:19.920
We can address this specifically.

36:19.920 --> 36:22.200
I did put in the comments

36:22.200 --> 36:23.760
because I kind of anticipated this.

36:23.760 --> 36:25.960
Fixit Felix, a while back, he made a post

36:25.960 --> 36:28.360
and kind of just assembled a lot of the qualifying questions

36:28.360 --> 36:30.200
slash green flags.

36:30.200 --> 36:32.440
And then of course the opposite of those would be red flags.

36:32.440 --> 36:34.240
He looks for one qualifying business center.

36:34.240 --> 36:35.640
So I put that in the chat.

36:35.640 --> 36:37.880
And Nick, I also texted it to you and Porter in Slack

36:37.880 --> 36:39.760
if you guys want to look at that real quick.

36:39.760 --> 36:41.840
But it kind of, these questions just,

36:41.840 --> 36:44.000
we look at them to check off the main boxes.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.320
And I kind of talked about this earlier,

36:45.320 --> 36:47.760
but hungry to grow their business.

36:48.600 --> 36:50.480
Not only that, kind of a nuance is hungry to grow,

36:50.480 --> 36:53.400
like hungry for the specific leads in the specific area.

36:53.400 --> 36:55.240
That's something that if you miss that,

36:55.240 --> 36:56.440
that can turn out to be a bad fit.

36:56.440 --> 36:58.160
If they have to travel 50 minutes

36:58.160 --> 37:00.760
and you don't realize that for your tree trimming job,

37:00.760 --> 37:02.960
you know, they're not gonna really be wanting to do that.

37:02.960 --> 37:04.680
So a couple questions.

37:04.680 --> 37:06.680
I'll let you answer these, Nick.

37:06.680 --> 37:08.400
Okay, let's go rapid fire through the questions.

37:08.400 --> 37:13.400
And real quick, let's, I love this green light

37:13.400 --> 37:15.480
in qualifying questions that you put.

37:15.480 --> 37:16.760
I think we can just copy and paste that

37:16.760 --> 37:19.320
as like a parting little gift for everybody.

37:19.320 --> 37:21.840
So let's just rapid fire these last few questions.

37:21.840 --> 37:22.680
We'll drop that.

37:22.680 --> 37:24.520
That's gonna be the green light, you know,

37:24.520 --> 37:25.720
and also the qualifying questions

37:25.720 --> 37:27.440
that you can, as like a takeaway.

37:28.600 --> 37:30.040
And real quick, if I could ask you, Nick,

37:30.040 --> 37:32.480
and I can give my quick 20 second opinion here.

37:32.480 --> 37:35.000
It seems like there's a balance on the cold call.

37:35.000 --> 37:36.520
If you ask too many probing questions,

37:36.520 --> 37:38.320
it's easy to lose the deal and spook them.

37:38.320 --> 37:40.000
And like, it's easy to lose.

37:40.000 --> 37:40.840
But then on the same end,

37:40.840 --> 37:42.840
you don't want to wait till you've sent four leads

37:42.840 --> 37:45.240
before you start to ask some discovery questions.

37:45.240 --> 37:47.720
So for me personally, it kind of seems like

37:47.720 --> 37:50.000
after I send that first lead,

37:50.000 --> 37:51.160
then I can kind of like,

37:51.160 --> 37:55.360
I now earned the right to like investigate to some degree.

37:55.360 --> 37:56.520
I don't know what your thoughts on that.

37:56.520 --> 37:59.160
Or like, if you have discovery calls after the cold caller.

37:59.160 --> 38:00.000
100%.

38:00.000 --> 38:01.600
Dude, from the top, as soon as I get the deal,

38:01.600 --> 38:03.680
if I feel confident enough to send them one lead

38:03.680 --> 38:05.000
and I don't feel like they're shady

38:05.000 --> 38:07.040
or trying to get a free lead, I'll send them the lead.

38:07.040 --> 38:09.440
And then I'll call them back after they get the lead.

38:09.440 --> 38:10.280
Like, hey, did you get that schedule?

38:10.280 --> 38:11.120
Awesome.

38:11.120 --> 38:12.560
Hey, I want to ask you really quick.

38:12.560 --> 38:15.000
Like, yeah, you've earned the right to ask those questions.

38:15.000 --> 38:17.360
And sometimes on that first call, I can tell,

38:17.360 --> 38:19.720
hey, dude, I actually was talking to my partner.

38:19.720 --> 38:21.400
This is something we're super interested in.

38:21.400 --> 38:22.560
Yo, you're from Utah.

38:22.560 --> 38:24.200
Like, they're just warm.

38:24.200 --> 38:26.960
I'll feel comfortable to do that right there.

38:26.960 --> 38:30.280
But a lot of times I do wait till the second call

38:30.280 --> 38:31.320
as I'm building the trust

38:31.320 --> 38:32.640
and earning the right to ask those questions.

38:32.640 --> 38:33.480
Yes, exactly.

38:34.520 --> 38:36.280
Sure, if you hear the chainsaw in the background,

38:36.280 --> 38:39.120
now's not a good time to ask how many crews they have.

38:39.120 --> 38:39.960
That's exactly.

38:39.960 --> 38:40.800
All right.

38:40.800 --> 38:42.680
That's exactly right.

38:42.680 --> 38:43.520
All right.

38:43.680 --> 38:45.040
Yeah, I just put that in the comments.

38:45.040 --> 38:46.760
I'll do it one more time.

38:46.760 --> 38:48.240
If, Nick, you want to just read through

38:48.240 --> 38:49.360
those qualifying questions,

38:49.360 --> 38:50.800
you can just kind of sprinkle these up

38:50.800 --> 38:52.400
throughout the sales process.

38:52.400 --> 38:55.040
Obviously, the earlier, the better without spooking up.

38:55.040 --> 38:56.120
So I'm going to just read through

38:56.120 --> 38:57.280
the qualifying questions right now.

38:57.280 --> 38:59.480
Some that you could ask, you don't need to ask all.

38:59.480 --> 39:02.760
And you certainly don't have to ask.

39:02.760 --> 39:05.240
These are just some good ideas, okay?

39:05.240 --> 39:07.840
Do you want more jobs, which is part of our script, right?

39:07.840 --> 39:10.120
Hey, are you hungry to take on more jobs?

39:10.120 --> 39:11.560
I'm guessing you're not allergic to money

39:11.560 --> 39:12.640
and you're spending money on ads.

39:12.840 --> 39:15.360
I'm assuming you want more jobs, okay?

39:17.120 --> 39:17.960
Then you can also ask

39:17.960 --> 39:21.200
if you will specifically want a certain type of job.

39:21.200 --> 39:23.640
You can ask how long they've been in business.

39:23.640 --> 39:25.200
That's indicative of like,

39:25.200 --> 39:27.440
if they're maybe going to go belly up

39:27.440 --> 39:28.600
or they have any money in the bank.

39:28.600 --> 39:29.840
Oh, I just started last week.

39:29.840 --> 39:31.120
I have a chainsaw and a truck.

39:31.120 --> 39:34.680
That one could last two days or, you know,

39:34.680 --> 39:35.520
those are rough.

39:35.520 --> 39:36.560
I've worked with those people before.

39:36.560 --> 39:37.640
They never pan out.

39:38.760 --> 39:41.840
Making sure that they're licensed and insured.

39:41.840 --> 39:43.320
That one you might want to bring up

39:43.320 --> 39:44.160
a little bit down the road.

39:44.160 --> 39:46.680
Cause if they're not, you might spook them.

39:47.720 --> 39:48.560
Again-

39:48.560 --> 39:50.440
If they have a green card at the minimum.

39:50.440 --> 39:51.280
About a hundred percent.

39:51.280 --> 39:52.120
Yeah, you got to make sure

39:52.120 --> 39:53.560
they at least are legal in the country.

39:53.560 --> 39:55.040
That's a given.

39:55.920 --> 39:56.760
I don't know.

39:56.760 --> 39:58.040
That one, I'm not sure we're going to include that

39:58.040 --> 39:59.200
in the training or how to bring that one up,

39:59.200 --> 40:01.480
but maybe we'll do that on a special section

40:01.480 --> 40:03.840
if you're targeting certain states.

40:03.840 --> 40:05.600
How many crews do you have?

40:05.600 --> 40:07.840
And then how are you currently landing your jobs?

40:07.840 --> 40:08.760
Are you getting them from Facebook?

40:08.760 --> 40:09.720
Is it referral?

40:09.720 --> 40:10.920
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

40:10.920 --> 40:14.240
And another question I might ask is,

40:14.240 --> 40:16.400
you know, I would ask this at some point,

40:16.400 --> 40:17.840
but you could also ask us on the opening calls,

40:17.840 --> 40:19.520
like, dude, it sounds like you know what you're doing.

40:19.520 --> 40:20.360
Like what?

40:20.360 --> 40:21.960
You probably have a pretty high close percentage, right?

40:21.960 --> 40:24.320
How many deals are you closing out of the,

40:24.320 --> 40:25.240
out of the leads you're getting?

40:25.240 --> 40:27.080
Or are you closing what percentage?

40:27.080 --> 40:29.520
And they're usually going to be like, oh, like 90%.

40:29.520 --> 40:31.520
And it's like, well, that's cause you get all your jobs

40:31.520 --> 40:32.360
from referrals.

40:32.360 --> 40:33.440
So they're already sold, bro.

40:33.440 --> 40:35.240
It should be a hundred percent.

40:35.240 --> 40:36.760
So actually anything below a hundred means

40:36.760 --> 40:39.640
you're sub-optimal human and you suck.

40:39.640 --> 40:40.880
But good job.

40:41.880 --> 40:43.880
Here's, should I go over the green lights really quick,

40:43.880 --> 40:45.000
Aaron, to wrap this up?

40:47.360 --> 40:48.560
Yeah.

40:48.560 --> 40:50.880
And obviously the opposite of these would be red flags.

40:50.880 --> 40:51.720
100%.

40:51.720 --> 40:52.560
Here's some green lights.

40:52.560 --> 40:54.320
If they're hungry to grow,

40:54.320 --> 40:55.840
if they're hungry for specific leads

40:55.840 --> 40:57.280
in your specific location,

40:57.280 --> 40:58.680
if they have bandwidth to grow,

40:58.680 --> 41:00.720
if they can actually handle more jobs,

41:00.720 --> 41:02.640
if they've been in business for at least a couple of years

41:02.640 --> 41:03.640
and that they're licensed to ensure,

41:03.640 --> 41:04.800
these are a couple of green flags.

41:04.800 --> 41:07.240
Anything opposite of this is going to be red flags as well.

41:07.240 --> 41:09.640
But guys, I guess as my final thought,

41:10.920 --> 41:12.200
you can have all the answers.

41:12.200 --> 41:13.840
You can have everything dialed out in front of you,

41:13.840 --> 41:16.120
but until you just start making calls,

41:16.120 --> 41:17.880
you're not going to know what the heck we're talking about.

41:17.880 --> 41:18.800
It's not going to make sense.

41:18.800 --> 41:20.120
It's not going to be relatable.

41:20.120 --> 41:21.120
You got to pick up the phone.

41:21.120 --> 41:22.120
You got to make the mistakes.

41:22.120 --> 41:24.120
You're going to have to call and say too much

41:24.120 --> 41:25.720
and bomb it on a business owner verbally

41:25.720 --> 41:28.240
until you lose the deal on the perfect business owner

41:28.240 --> 41:29.680
that was going to pay you all this money.

41:29.680 --> 41:31.880
And you said too much, you lost the deal.

41:31.880 --> 41:33.760
I mean, Porter has lost like $3,000 a month

41:33.760 --> 41:37.000
in retainers over the last like six hours, dude,

41:37.000 --> 41:38.760
or six days.

41:38.760 --> 41:41.080
I mean, Porter's just giving away.

41:41.080 --> 41:41.920
Just throw it.

41:41.920 --> 41:43.240
Just give it.

41:43.240 --> 41:44.080
No, I'm just kidding.

41:44.080 --> 41:45.680
But you have to lose these deals, guys.

41:45.680 --> 41:48.640
I've lost deals saying some of the most silliest stuff,

41:48.640 --> 41:50.160
embarrassing stuff.

41:51.800 --> 41:53.640
I mean, it's just dumb stunts.

41:53.640 --> 41:54.960
And this is including alarms.

41:54.960 --> 41:57.280
Like I've lost thousands and tens of thousands of dollars

41:57.280 --> 41:59.760
just saying and doing the wrong stuff.

41:59.760 --> 42:03.680
And it took those deals that I lost

42:03.680 --> 42:05.000
to get to where I am now.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.480
And so I looked at it as like a debt

42:06.480 --> 42:08.440
that I was paying towards learning how to do this.

42:08.440 --> 42:12.120
So I think no matter what we said here, guys,

42:12.120 --> 42:14.720
if you're not doing calls, if you're not making calls,

42:14.720 --> 42:15.960
none of this matters.

42:15.960 --> 42:17.880
Step one, make calls.

42:17.880 --> 42:19.880
Step two, figure out where you're going wrong.

42:19.880 --> 42:23.160
Take the information we shared today and start refining.

42:23.160 --> 42:25.400
Become obsessed with your craft.

42:25.400 --> 42:26.600
Become obsessed and dial them.

42:26.600 --> 42:30.520
Because if you can get 5%, 10%, 15% better at this,

42:30.520 --> 42:33.600
again, the people that make the most money in this business

42:33.600 --> 42:36.360
are not the geeks, not the tech, not the this, that,

42:36.360 --> 42:37.640
the rest, Mr. Backlink.

42:37.640 --> 42:40.520
They're the people that know how to get business owners

42:40.520 --> 42:42.040
to give them their credit card.

42:42.040 --> 42:43.400
They don't even have the best product.

42:43.400 --> 42:45.800
They don't even give their business owners the most leads.

42:45.800 --> 42:47.680
They're not even the best at retaining them.

42:47.680 --> 42:49.840
They are the best at getting business owners

42:49.840 --> 42:51.240
to give them their money.

42:51.240 --> 42:53.720
And so you don't have to be in sales

42:53.720 --> 42:56.000
or have a sales experience to start,

42:56.000 --> 42:57.880
but it is in your best interest

42:57.880 --> 43:00.480
to start obsessing over this skill

43:00.480 --> 43:02.800
and at least do it until you get to a certain revenue level.

43:02.800 --> 43:04.600
And then sure, go ahead and outsource it.

43:04.600 --> 43:07.000
Find somebody to do it if you really, really hate it.

43:07.000 --> 43:10.080
But this is a skillset that has the highest return

43:10.080 --> 43:11.800
of any skillset in this business.

43:11.800 --> 43:13.120
And it is called sales,

43:13.120 --> 43:16.840
and it is taking candy from little children.

43:16.840 --> 43:17.800
I'm just kidding.

43:17.800 --> 43:19.400
All right, anything else?

43:19.400 --> 43:20.560
Any other questions?

43:23.520 --> 43:26.280
There was a couple of questions on rank and rent engine one,

43:26.280 --> 43:28.120
but I don't know if, is there a live,

43:28.120 --> 43:29.800
like when I'm trying to think of something we can,

43:29.800 --> 43:31.120
something we can point them to

43:31.120 --> 43:33.400
if they have more questions about that.

43:33.400 --> 43:35.040
I'll text Ryan right now

43:35.080 --> 43:37.120
and see if he wants to go live in the group

43:37.120 --> 43:38.360
and kind of ask those questions.

43:38.360 --> 43:40.880
If you wanna screenshot those and send me a text after,

43:40.880 --> 43:42.160
let's separate those,

43:42.160 --> 43:43.480
so that would make a really good live.

43:43.480 --> 43:45.120
I think there's probably gonna be a bunch of questions

43:45.120 --> 43:47.400
that have come up sitting out that people are using it

43:47.400 --> 43:48.960
and whatever, but that's a great point.

43:48.960 --> 43:49.800
Will you text me?

43:50.680 --> 43:51.520
Yes.

43:51.520 --> 43:52.360
Okay, guys, if you-

43:52.360 --> 43:54.840
So guys, we're gonna address those questions.

43:54.840 --> 43:57.400
Yeah, so those aren't gonna get ignored.

43:57.400 --> 43:58.720
Yeah, no, for sure.

44:00.000 --> 44:01.400
In fact, let me just text him

44:01.400 --> 44:03.240
so no one thinks I'm making that up.

44:04.040 --> 44:05.480
Hey, I'm on the call,

44:07.440 --> 44:08.720
the live right now.

44:10.640 --> 44:15.080
We have some people that have questions

44:15.080 --> 44:17.640
about rank and run engine.

44:17.640 --> 44:20.800
Anyway, rank and run engine.

44:20.800 --> 44:21.640
I'm gonna say wanna go live-

44:21.640 --> 44:23.600
We have one more qualified question

44:23.600 --> 44:25.080
we can ask after this.

44:26.400 --> 44:27.240
Okay.

44:29.720 --> 44:30.560
Okay, go ahead.

44:31.560 --> 44:32.400
Awesome.

44:32.400 --> 44:33.480
So Mike Price says,

44:33.480 --> 44:35.760
what do you guys think about selling to the top,

44:35.760 --> 44:38.920
like one to five organically ranked companies in the city,

44:38.920 --> 44:41.720
people who have probably invested in SEO at some point?

44:43.120 --> 44:45.520
As long as they're running ads, dude, I don't care.

44:45.520 --> 44:48.280
I got a business owner right now in one of my areas

44:48.280 --> 44:53.040
that is ranked on Google.

44:53.040 --> 44:58.040
They're also paying another company to do what I'm doing.

44:58.400 --> 45:01.080
I think that they might just be paying them to do SEO

45:01.080 --> 45:04.280
and they are buying leads.

45:06.280 --> 45:07.440
So as long as they're running ads,

45:07.440 --> 45:09.000
they're still hungry to grow, dude.

45:10.440 --> 45:13.080
If they're not, I don't really see that,

45:13.080 --> 45:14.880
I'm probably not gonna target them.

45:14.880 --> 45:18.880
That I do like, if I don't have any,

45:18.880 --> 45:20.320
if they're not paying for ads,

45:21.120 --> 45:22.720
can't find anyone in the Facebook group,

45:22.720 --> 45:24.760
the fact that I can tell they've done SEO

45:24.760 --> 45:26.760
at least lets me know they spent some money

45:26.760 --> 45:27.600
on their market.

45:28.280 --> 45:30.040
They paid somebody to build their website.

45:30.040 --> 45:31.760
That's at least a start,

45:31.760 --> 45:33.280
but I'd probably try to target somebody

45:33.280 --> 45:35.040
like on the bottom of page one, top of page two,

45:35.040 --> 45:36.840
where I can tell their page title is done

45:36.840 --> 45:38.320
by someone in those SEO.

45:38.320 --> 45:40.440
They have an H1, you can kind of tell

45:40.440 --> 45:41.960
if it's done professionally.

45:41.960 --> 45:43.320
I wouldn't target somebody like that.

45:43.320 --> 45:45.160
It's like, oh, they paid money,

45:45.160 --> 45:47.320
but they're not getting the lead.

45:47.320 --> 45:49.960
So, but if they're paying for ads,

45:49.960 --> 45:51.400
I don't really care where they're ranked

45:51.400 --> 45:53.760
because they want more business.

45:53.760 --> 45:55.680
Most of the big companies, by the way,

45:55.720 --> 45:58.080
that client that was paying me like 30 grand a month

45:58.080 --> 46:01.040
at one point, all of the cities

46:01.040 --> 46:02.280
that we were getting leads for them,

46:02.280 --> 46:07.000
their website was ranked at the top three with us.

46:08.320 --> 46:09.360
They were just hungry.

46:10.320 --> 46:11.200
So it doesn't matter.

46:11.200 --> 46:12.040
It doesn't matter.

46:12.040 --> 46:12.880
Just go for it.

46:12.880 --> 46:14.640
Sometimes you gotta stop overthinking too.

46:14.640 --> 46:15.800
And it's a great question,

46:15.800 --> 46:17.440
but I think sometimes the reason

46:17.440 --> 46:19.280
that someone like me and Porter

46:19.280 --> 46:23.440
and some of these guys are doing well

46:23.440 --> 46:24.480
is we don't overthink

46:24.480 --> 46:26.360
or we're too lazy to think or we can't think.

46:26.360 --> 46:27.200
I don't know.

46:27.200 --> 46:28.040
We're just like, oh, sweet.

46:28.040 --> 46:30.000
Pick up the phone, call, give them a couple of leads,

46:30.000 --> 46:31.360
build up a little website.

46:31.360 --> 46:33.000
That sounds easy.

46:33.000 --> 46:33.960
And that's why we do it.

46:33.960 --> 46:34.800
And I'm telling you,

46:34.800 --> 46:35.800
this is such a simple business model.

46:35.800 --> 46:37.000
Don't ever complicate it.

46:38.400 --> 46:39.400
That's it.

46:39.400 --> 46:40.240
All right.

46:40.240 --> 46:41.060
Thanks guys.

46:41.060 --> 46:41.900
Appreciate it, Aaron.

46:41.900 --> 46:43.880
I'm gonna upload this to our deal

46:43.880 --> 46:45.240
and I'll see you soon.

46:45.240 --> 46:46.640
I'll see you too on our team meeting.

46:46.640 --> 46:47.480
Appreciate everyone being on.

46:47.480 --> 46:51.400
We'll see you on next Tuesday at 7 a.m. MST.

46:51.400 --> 46:52.640
If you're new, by the way,

46:52.640 --> 46:53.520
welcome to your first call.

46:53.520 --> 46:54.720
Much more to come.

46:54.720 --> 46:56.160
And I just met, hold on.

46:56.160 --> 46:57.400
Let me see if Ryan notices me back.

46:57.400 --> 46:58.480
I just told him he can go live

46:58.480 --> 46:59.440
anytime he wants this week.

46:59.440 --> 47:00.400
Let me see.

47:00.400 --> 47:01.280
Has not responded yet.

47:01.280 --> 47:04.000
As soon as he does, we'll make an announcement.

47:04.000 --> 47:04.840
Thanks guys.

47:04.840 --> 47:05.760
Talk soon. See you guys.

47:05.760 --> 47:06.600
Bye.
