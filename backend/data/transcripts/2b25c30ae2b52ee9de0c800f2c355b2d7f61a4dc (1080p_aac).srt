1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,920
All right, so the phone ain't ringing now what first of all if it's been 24 hours 12 hours

2
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,860
Two days three days even four days and you're watching this video and going. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh

3
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:25,180
Oh my gosh, stop turn off the video and wait a little longer

4
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:32,700
Okay, but if it's been ten days or let's say say eight to ten days and nothing's happening. You're not getting any leads then

5
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:36,300
Yeah, we let's dig in let's figure out what's going on

6
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,100
So the first thing that we want to do is we got to figure out we got to diagnose the problem

7
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:44,800
Okay, we're gonna figure out what is it that we're not getting? Okay, obviously, we're not getting leads

8
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:50,940
But let's go back a little bit further. Let's see if it's deeper than that. Are we not getting leads? Okay, great

9
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,940
So but are we getting clicks?

10
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:58,500
Okay, so we're getting clicks but not leads so we can kind of look there. Are we getting impressions?

11
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,660
Okay, so we're getting impressions, but not clicks

12
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:05,060
So maybe it's there, you know, and we just start digging in layer by layer by layer

13
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:09,160
But here is the key and this is very similar to when you're not closing deals

14
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:14,020
You always want to look at the step or steps prior because that's where the issue is

15
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,180
Okay, and so here's what you need to look at

16
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:16,620
Okay

17
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:21,980
If you are not getting and let me see if I can say this correctly if I if I don't say it correctly

18
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:27,140
I will resay it and I'll tell you but I might mess this up

19
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:32,020
Okay, but it just just hear me out. So if you are not getting leads

20
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:40,380
But you're getting clicks. It's usually an issue with your landing page because think about it. People are clicking on your ads

21
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:48,260
They're going to your page, but you're not converting them into calls. So it's usually a landing page issue. Okay now if you are getting

22
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,180
impressions

23
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,180
But you're not getting clicks

24
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:58,820
It's usually an issue with your ad, right? Google is showing it to people they're putting it in front of people's faces

25
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:03,060
That's the impressions but your ad copy is not grabbing them. And so that's why they're not

26
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:08,840
Clicking on it. Okay, and so you just need to figure out like what is the issue?

27
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,620
Because ultimately if we're not getting phone calls that is that's a problem

28
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,940
That's that's what we need to figure out

29
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:19,460
We want to go deeper and want to figure out what part of this we're actually

30
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:26,620
Making a mistake. Okay, so that's number one is we're gonna diagnose where the issue is step two after you've diagnosed

31
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:31,020
What part? Okay. Well, I'm getting impressions, but I'm not getting clicks or I'm getting clicks

32
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,100
But I'm not getting calls

33
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,180
What I want you to do is I want you to go and watch

34
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:41,020
The video prior the video prior to this or the two prior to this or whatever video you need to watch that talks about

35
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:44,100
That specific topic. So if you're having an issue with

36
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:48,220
The landing page because you're getting clicks, but you're not getting calls

37
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:51,380
You're gonna want to go and watch the module that talks about

38
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,020
That building the landing page you're gonna talk. It's called money love speed

39
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,380
That's the module you're gonna want to watch the infamous one pager

40
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:00,200
Okay, if you're having a problem with some other area go watch that video

41
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,200
So I want you to go and watch that video

42
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:10,300
Whatever one it is and figure out is it something that you skipped whether on accident or on purpose because most often what I found

43
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:14,180
Is that it's not because what we trained isn't working

44
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,580
It's because you did something incorrect

45
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:20,740
Maybe you set up the landing page and you thought you did everything correctly

46
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:24,500
But you look at it and the phone number is nowhere to be found

47
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,180
You had all the intention of the world of putting the phone number on there

48
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:32,060
But it's just nowhere to be found or maybe it's right there, but it's not clickable or maybe it's clickable

49
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:36,340
But it's not underlined. It's not highlighted and so no one's clicking on it. Maybe you didn't put the form

50
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:39,100
Maybe the four like there's so many different variables

51
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:46,500
I want you to go and rewatch that specific video that pertains to that step or covers that step and make sure you're doing it

52
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:50,340
Exactly how it's trained in that video

53
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:56,660
Okay, because until you do that we're not gonna be able to know and I'm telling you most often 99% of the time

54
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:02,660
You're gonna figure out what you're doing wrong. You're gonna go. Let's say let's say you're getting impressions, but you're not getting clicks

55
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:07,820
You're gonna go look at your ad copy and you're gonna go. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. I put I spelled the city wrong

56
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,220
I put Queen Creek and I spelled it. I spelled Creek wrong

57
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:15,620
I added an E and people are seeing it and they like oh my gosh, who's this incompetent business, right?

58
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:21,100
So go first of all step one diagnosed step two go watch the video

59
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:28,320
That talks about and trains on the part that you're messing up. Okay based on your diagnosis step three

60
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,740
I'm gonna ask you to go into the Facebook community and

61
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,420
Search the group okay

62
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:40,380
I'm gonna have you search the group and look for conversations related to what you're having an issue with

63
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,340
So if you're having an issue with your landing page

64
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:49,460
I want you to go into this search bar at the very top corner a little magnifying glass and type click on it and type

65
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,820
landing page one pager

66
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,300
Whatever

67
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:02,460
Weebly site or any keyword that you think people would type in when they're referring to

68
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:08,820
The page that we eventually throw away the landing page that we use and then we eventually throw away and I want you to search for

69
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:14,660
conversations around that and the reason I'm gonna direct you here instead of immediately just reaching out to fix it Felix or reaching

70
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:19,140
Out to me or reaching out to somebody else is because guys I'm trying to turn you into entrepreneurs

71
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:26,180
I'm trying to see how many millionaires I can create in this group and you just messaging me and me spoon-feeding you the answer

72
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:32,820
First of all, it's not it doesn't work like mathematically. I don't have the time but number two. It's not teaching you anything

73
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:36,580
Okay, I want you to be a problem solver. I want you to be able to go. Okay

74
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,100
I diagnosed the issue. I

75
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:45,540
Went and watched the video and now I'm gonna go search the group and search these conversations to see that see if I can figure

76
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:50,220
It out on my own because what happens when you have this problem? It's 2 a.m. In the morning and everybody's asleep

77
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:53,900
Okay, all right. You don't have the option to reach out to people

78
00:05:53,900 --> 00:06:00,500
Okay, I want you to be a problem solver. And so I'm first after you've diagnosed it after you've watched the video

79
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:04,620
I want you to go and I want you to search the group and look for threads look for

80
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:11,620
Conversations about the thing that you're struggling with whether it's the ad copy whether it's the one pager whether it's

81
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,900
Setting up the ad properly get a location or whatever

82
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:21,700
You've diagnosed as the issue number four the fourth thing that I want you to do is if you go in and you've done all

83
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:26,340
These things you've diagnosed it. You've watched the video. You've searched the group. You've looked at the conversation

84
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:29,100
You've responded to it and you're still stuck

85
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:33,660
Go and make a post go and make a post. It says hey guys, I

86
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:42,380
Have X amount of clicks and no leads and I've done this this this and this and I'm just not figuring this out

87
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:47,640
Could somebody give me some insight and you're free to tag fix it Felix. Okay, you're free to tag me as well

88
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,560
I'm just gonna be honest. I'll get to it as fast as I can but I am trying my best to use my time the best

89
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:00,420
The best to benefit everybody. Okay, so tagging fix that Felix is gonna be your best option

90
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:05,720
But go and make a post and be very thorough be very specific about it and ask people for help say hey

91
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,440
Here's what's going on. I've done this this isn't this and I still can't figure it out

92
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,960
Is there anybody that can help me and maybe what you can do is you can look and go?

93
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:18,440
There's some of those threads some of those comments I looked at that was Jeff, you know Jeff was having that issue

94
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:22,360
So maybe you go and you can tag Jeff, you know, yeah after you post it at Jeff

95
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,320
Hey Jeff, I noticed you were having some similar issues. You have any insight on this

96
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,000
Use your head and go and post. I'm telling you if you do those four steps and

97
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:39,960
You again, this is I just should even go without saying but I'm gonna say it make sure that this isn't you just completely didn't skip

98
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:46,400
Module one where I said don't go into these niches look out for this, you know, look out for that, etc

99
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,960
Then you are going to figure this out some other things to take into account and they're easier to forget during the summer

100
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:58,400
Which it's summer right now and I'm filming this in the winter. It's really easy is I also want you to think about the winter

101
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,800
I want you to think about the the the weather right now

102
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,840
I know in Australia and some other places winter is different different time of the year

103
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,880
But think about it, right use your head go look at the forecast

104
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,960
You're running concrete ads and it's December and and you're in Minneapolis

105
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,800
Okay, first of all, you should probably shouldn't be in Minneapolis

106
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:20,560
But let's say you are let's say for some weird reason that the due diligence works and it's a low-hanging fruit layup

107
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:27,260
Guys who's searching for concrete who's even thinking about putting in concrete during Christmas?

108
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:29,960
Nobody wants to go spend money on concrete during Christmas

109
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:36,480
That's something you spend for most homeowners after they get their tax returns back when it's spring cleanup when people are getting back into

110
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:41,320
Backyards and cleaning up the yard and do all those things use your head go look at the last 10 days weather

111
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:47,440
Could that be affecting it? Is there a hurt? Are you in Florida and there's a damn hurricane? Okay

112
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:54,680
Are you in Arkansas and there has been a tornado look at these different factors and also this is something to consider

113
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:58,840
And I guess I I almost skip over this because it just makes sense in my head

114
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,960
But don't look okay

115
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:06,040
If this was in your city is there something that's happening in your city that there's probably not that many people searching that weekend

116
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:10,280
Is it the Ironman that weekend go and use your head and look at those things?

117
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:15,520
But if you use your head you've done the the the module one correctly you've picked the perfect niche

118
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:20,520
You've you've found a layup and you've done those four things guys. We're gonna figure this out

119
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:24,040
I promise you there's always a solution and we will figure this out

120
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,560
That's it
