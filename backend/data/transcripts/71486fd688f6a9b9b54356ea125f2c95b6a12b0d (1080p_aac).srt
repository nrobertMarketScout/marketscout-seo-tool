1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,120
Let's talk about building your actual asset in what you should use.

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,360
Now I don't personally care what you use.

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,880
It can be WordPress, it can be Wix, it can be Weebly, it can be any of the above.

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,880
It doesn't matter.

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,080
It can be Squarespace or whatever new thing they come out with after I recorded this video.

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,080
It really doesn't matter, but what I want you to think about for a minute is this.

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:32,520
Let's talk about a custom home builder and let's talk about a spec home behemoth like

8
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,480
DR Horton or one of these national companies.

9
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:39,760
Now the custom home builder builds a very beautiful pretty home.

10
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,400
They go in, they get these customers and they're like, hey, where do you want the wall and

11
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,520
what do you want on this one and how do you want the bathroom and they're these beautiful

12
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,680
homes.

13
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:53,120
But there's so much work into it, there's so much effort into it that they can only

14
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,640
build 10 or 15 of these a year.

15
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,040
Whereas a DR Horton, they're like, hey, we've got four homes and you can choose one of the

16
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:04,600
four homes, you can choose one of the four finishes, you can choose one of these carpets,

17
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,240
one of these paints and they knock them out and they knock them out and they knock them

18
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,480
out and they knock them out and even though the DR Horton home isn't as beautiful as the

19
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:20,600
custom home, I would love to see the guy that owns DR Horton, I would love to see his house

20
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:25,560
and his bank account versus Mr. Joe Schmo custom home builder.

21
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,120
So it's the same thing as McDonald's, in fact, fun little fact here, I was reading this book

22
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:35,720
last night, The Cash Flow Quadrant by old Robert Kiyosaki, my boy and he was talking

23
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,840
about this and he was talking about McDonald's, right?

24
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,360
Could you or can you think of five or ten places that make better hamburgers than McDonald's?

25
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,960
I can and I don't even like hamburgers but can you think of a single place that has a

26
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:53,520
better system than the McDonald's that can churn out a hamburger that is the same hamburger

27
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:59,560
here as it is in Ghana, West Africa or here as it is in New York City or here as it is

28
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,880
in Australia?

29
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,880
You can't.

30
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,960
So the game is we're here to make money and we don't need to get emotionally attached

31
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,080
to how these websites look because that's not where the money is, the money is in getting

32
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,800
the phone to ring and getting another client and getting more deals.

33
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,560
So with that said, I just want you to know it doesn't matter what you use, it only matters

34
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,680
that you master what you do and you figure out how to do it quickly and efficiently and

35
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,960
it converts, okay?

36
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,400
So we are going to show you, I'm gonna have Francesca is gonna jump in here in just a

37
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,400
moment.

38
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,320
She's gonna show you what we use and everything that we're gonna teach you in these modules

39
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:41,720
is what my agency Evergreen does and has done and has used to go from what we were doing

40
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,520
which is almost nothing to seven figures.

41
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,520
So I'm gonna let her jump in and show you how to get that set up.

42
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,480
We personally use Weebly.

43
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:55,060
Okay, so I'm going to show you how to create a designer Weebly account.

44
00:02:55,060 --> 00:03:05,080
So you are going to search for designers.weebly.com register and you're going to end up on this

45
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:10,480
page right here and you're going to fill out this information.

46
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,660
So we already have an account, I'm just going to show you how to create your own.

47
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:21,540
Make sure you are on designer Weebly and not just Weebly, they are different.

48
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:24,900
The designer one lets you do a lot more things in depth.

49
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,740
So make sure you are on that one.

50
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,500
So you're going to fill out your information.

51
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:35,900
I'm just doing a quick, quick one and boom, pretty easy.

52
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:40,320
And now I'm going to log it into our own account.

53
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,120
This was just to show you how this one would be created.
