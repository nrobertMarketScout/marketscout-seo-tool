00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,320
Sam Holmes, do you recommend starting an LLC ASAP?

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:04,720
Go get a couple deals, then worry about it.

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,340
It's not that big of a deal.

4
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,560
This is not legal advice.

5
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:09,760
Eventually you wanna do it.

6
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,560
And I've heard people say like,

7
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,040
obviously you wanna go set up an LLC

8
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,880
because you wanna tell yourself

9
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,720
and you wanna tell the world,

10
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,240
you wanna act like you're doing this for real.

11
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,520
This isn't just some dabbling.

12
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,880
And I'm not saying that you shouldn't do it

13
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,000
for those reasons.

14
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,200
What I'm saying is that don't let,

15
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,220
oh, I don't wanna do any cold calls today

16
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:29,600
because I don't have an LLC.

17
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,360
Don't let that be the thing that stops you.

18
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,640
Go get some deals, man.

19
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,400
I did, let's see, I did the towing deal.

20
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,720
I did the basic waterproofing deal.

21
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,620
I did three or four deals back in 2016

22
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,380
when I first started this

23
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,360
before I even thought about an LLC.

24
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,920
I wasn't even sure this model still would work.

25
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,840
This is back to six years ago, okay?

26
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,560
So if you have somebody that could set it up for you

27
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,520
and whatever, just go, yeah, have them do it.

28
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,360
That's great.

29
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,900
Don't let that be the thing

30
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,040
that prioritizes making cold calls.

31
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:57,960
Don't let that be the thing

32
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,680
that prioritizes doing due diligence

33
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,960
or doing Zoom closes or whatever.

34
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,120
Make sure to prioritize the things that actually matter

35
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,720
versus the thing that is urgent, okay?

36
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,000
Sometimes those are the same thing,

37
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,280
but a lot of times the things that actually matter

38
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,200
are not urgent.

39
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,160
And so they get pushed to the back burner

40
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:19,280
and the front burner gets the stuff that's urgent,

41
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,580
but doesn't move the needle, okay?

42
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:22,880
Always be moving the needle.
