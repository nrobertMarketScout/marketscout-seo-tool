WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.960
Oh. All right, guys.

00:04.960 --> 00:07.040
And when I say guys, I think there's only one person on.

00:07.400 --> 00:09.800
It's cool. It's good to have Hustler 80.

00:11.600 --> 00:13.160
It says love is breaking.

00:13.160 --> 00:16.000
I don't know if that means live is breaking. Oh, great.

00:16.600 --> 00:17.560
Well, let's just try it.

00:17.560 --> 00:18.640
Let's just try to do it, Zach.

00:18.640 --> 00:20.760
It is what it is. It's it's live, dude.

00:20.760 --> 00:22.960
That's the point. It's supposed to break.

00:24.040 --> 00:27.400
It's at least you guys know, completely polished.

00:27.840 --> 00:31.040
So we're we have four people watching.

00:31.040 --> 00:35.640
If you are on this live right now, I'd love to hear just comment on it.

00:35.640 --> 00:37.640
Just say something. You can say that.

00:37.640 --> 00:41.040
Say, what's up? Say you can hear me just so I know who's on.

00:41.040 --> 00:43.600
The funny thing about YouTube is it's a username.

00:43.600 --> 00:45.680
So we got like Hustler 80.

00:45.680 --> 00:48.480
You got all kinds of different names, but I'll call you guys by your name.

00:48.480 --> 00:51.800
So we're just going to jump in.

00:51.800 --> 00:54.200
I want to get I wanted Zach to get on this call today.

00:55.200 --> 00:56.480
If you guys don't know who I am,

00:56.480 --> 00:59.400
go watch some of the other YouTube videos that we put out.

00:59.400 --> 01:02.720
I've been doing this business model of building simple websites,

01:02.960 --> 01:06.440
ranking them on Google and renting them out for almost nine years.

01:06.960 --> 01:09.120
Lost a bunch of money, made a bunch of money.

01:09.120 --> 01:13.120
But I think it's one of the best business models on the Internet.

01:13.160 --> 01:15.840
OK, I want to bring Zach on

01:16.560 --> 01:19.040
because Zach does things a little bit differently.

01:19.040 --> 01:21.320
Zach is somebody that I started working with like,

01:21.480 --> 01:23.440
I think it was like two and a half years ago.

01:24.200 --> 01:27.600
And he he needed to get out of his job.

01:27.600 --> 01:29.840
He needed to replace the income from his job.

01:29.840 --> 01:32.680
And Zach, at that time, you're making like six thousand gross, right?

01:35.440 --> 01:38.360
After taxes, my job, I'd bring home like forty six hundred.

01:38.360 --> 01:40.600
So, yeah. OK.

01:40.600 --> 01:42.040
So he's making forty six.

01:42.040 --> 01:43.720
The taxes are crazy.

01:43.720 --> 01:46.040
It's making forty six hundred bucks a month.

01:46.040 --> 01:48.760
But he's like, I need to get that replaced as soon as possible

01:48.760 --> 01:51.200
so I can keep building my dream.

01:51.520 --> 01:54.480
And many of you guys are in that same situation

01:54.480 --> 01:58.040
where you want to do digital real estate, you want to do something online,

01:58.040 --> 02:03.840
but you need to get that initial jail be nine to five, whatever it is.

02:03.840 --> 02:05.200
Maybe it's even a business.

02:05.200 --> 02:07.400
It's just not bringing in a lot of money.

02:07.400 --> 02:11.480
You need to get that income replaced so you can then focus on other things

02:11.480 --> 02:13.520
like building digital real estate.

02:13.520 --> 02:18.360
So I want to bring Zach on because I've realized that sometimes people need,

02:18.680 --> 02:21.960
you know, different ways out of the the rat race.

02:21.960 --> 02:22.680
They want to get out.

02:22.680 --> 02:25.400
And I think the best thing you can do as quickly as you can get out

02:25.720 --> 02:27.080
is the method that you should take.

02:27.080 --> 02:30.920
And so Zach has found this really, really interesting way

02:31.120 --> 02:34.480
of of selling simple SEO services

02:35.160 --> 02:37.760
where he has been able to scale.

02:38.400 --> 02:41.840
Zach, are all of your deals, your fifty eight thousand dollars per month,

02:41.840 --> 02:43.480
is that one hundred percent SEO?

02:46.080 --> 02:48.280
I have one lead client.

02:48.280 --> 02:50.520
For five hundred a month, everything else is SEO.

02:50.520 --> 02:52.120
Yeah, that's crazy, bro.

02:52.120 --> 02:53.160
I'll buy it from you.

02:55.160 --> 02:56.080
We'll talk later.

02:57.880 --> 02:59.760
So OK, so fifty seven.

02:59.760 --> 03:04.640
I missed fifty seven thousand five hundred dollars all from selling simple SEO.

03:04.640 --> 03:08.720
And I'm I'm I'm enunciating and I'm putting the emphasis on the simple

03:08.720 --> 03:13.440
because Zach's strategy is very unique when I and the reason

03:13.440 --> 03:16.640
I was a big you guys watched me for a long time, I was a big hater of SEO

03:16.640 --> 03:21.920
services because I did it wrong and I tried to go land a bunch of big clients.

03:22.240 --> 03:23.680
I had clients cancel on me.

03:23.680 --> 03:26.840
I had this really bad experience and I was like, no, don't do it.

03:26.840 --> 03:27.800
Don't do it.

03:27.800 --> 03:30.800
And then Zach started scaling and I was like, well, obviously

03:30.800 --> 03:32.320
he knows something that I don't.

03:32.320 --> 03:33.280
Let's take a look.

03:33.280 --> 03:37.360
And so we hopped on the phone and I realized, oh, he's doing this very, very differently.

03:37.360 --> 03:39.840
So Zach does this in such a way, guys,

03:39.840 --> 03:43.880
that he doesn't put himself at risk of like losing a bunch of business.

03:43.880 --> 03:47.920
The other thing is he has his team that he's built doing this for him.

03:48.280 --> 03:53.480
And on top of that, he actually has if he were to go in right now today into his.

03:54.280 --> 03:55.960
Let's call it 50.

03:55.960 --> 03:58.120
Let's call it because your deals are smaller.

03:58.120 --> 03:59.960
So you probably have close to 100 clients, right?

04:02.200 --> 04:05.800
Yeah, there's like a hundred and seventy some hundred and seventy.

04:05.840 --> 04:07.080
You do like really small.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.600
So, guys, you've got this business brick by brick, right?

04:10.080 --> 04:12.280
Well, imagine he goes to half of those clients

04:12.440 --> 04:14.400
and pitches them on a lead generation deal.

04:14.840 --> 04:17.600
He's got a ton of money sitting on the table.

04:18.360 --> 04:21.080
And so you can do this in a really strategic way.

04:22.320 --> 04:25.240
Excuse me, that I have never seen done before.

04:25.240 --> 04:30.000
So as a way to just add value to you guys and to show you guys

04:30.000 --> 04:34.440
something a little bit different, I want to bring Zach on, talk about his overall strategy.

04:34.680 --> 04:38.800
And then also the other reason I like talking about this is because SEO

04:38.880 --> 04:42.600
is a part of what we are doing inside of lead generation,

04:42.600 --> 04:44.600
inside of digital real estate, inside of ranking.

04:44.600 --> 04:48.360
We have to rank the website at some point, whether you do it at the beginning

04:48.360 --> 04:50.480
or you do what I do, you sell it and then rank it.

04:50.480 --> 04:53.560
You have to do the ranking part to complete the process.

04:53.800 --> 04:56.720
So Zach just happened to focus on the ranking of other people's websites.

04:56.720 --> 04:58.960
So, Zach, welcome to call, man.

04:58.960 --> 04:59.840
Let's just get into it.

04:59.840 --> 05:02.400
I know you you've got we've got like twenty five minutes

05:02.680 --> 05:03.680
and then you got to hop off.

05:03.680 --> 05:04.960
And I think that's perfect.

05:04.960 --> 05:08.080
So kind of explain to everyone.

05:08.080 --> 05:12.160
High level, what it is that you do, like the type of clients that you have.

05:12.280 --> 05:14.800
And then maybe we can talk about your process from like,

05:15.520 --> 05:17.440
like, again, like a ten thousand foot view.

05:17.720 --> 05:20.880
And then if people, you know, want to check more of your stuff out,

05:20.880 --> 05:21.720
whenever we can let them know.

05:21.720 --> 05:25.960
But just I want to inspire people that there's you can get your life

05:25.960 --> 05:28.600
can change in a matter of 12 months.

05:28.600 --> 05:31.320
And so let's let's just start there and let's talk about

05:31.480 --> 05:35.640
let's talk about what you actually do, your business does.

05:38.600 --> 05:40.800
Yeah, so pretty simple.

05:40.840 --> 05:44.400
I started out actually 100 percent focused on lead gen,

05:44.880 --> 05:47.480
building sites, ranking those sites.

05:47.480 --> 05:50.480
That's why I still have a client like that I've had for years.

05:51.920 --> 05:54.200
And then I realized there was this opportunity

05:54.560 --> 05:57.680
because my dad owns a carpet cleaning company where

05:58.600 --> 06:01.280
I built his website and ranked that well.

06:01.520 --> 06:04.040
And then his friends wanted me to build their websites.

06:04.040 --> 06:05.840
And it was the same skill set.

06:05.840 --> 06:09.960
And I was like, man, I could see the path to quit my job

06:10.160 --> 06:15.160
if I just stacked these easy website builds plus SEO clients.

06:15.680 --> 06:18.040
So that's what I started doing.

06:18.800 --> 06:20.400
I already knew how to build the websites.

06:20.400 --> 06:21.960
I already knew how to rank the sites.

06:21.960 --> 06:25.520
Now, instead of building my own sites and putting the money into that

06:25.920 --> 06:30.280
to then land the deals later, I would just go

06:31.160 --> 06:33.640
make money day one, which I liked.

06:34.040 --> 06:35.560
I would just go get the deal.

06:35.560 --> 06:36.840
They pay me day one.

06:36.840 --> 06:40.400
Then my team and I build the website and help it rank.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.600
And they just keep paying us every month.

06:42.600 --> 06:45.720
And it was low stress because I would start out, just charge

06:46.160 --> 06:48.680
three hundred to five hundred bucks a month per client

06:49.120 --> 06:54.120
and just stack those clients is easy wins, easy wins, easy wins

06:54.560 --> 06:57.720
until I was able to quit my job quickly.

06:57.920 --> 07:00.360
Like, I started doing that

07:00.360 --> 07:03.360
about four or six months later, quit my job,

07:03.360 --> 07:05.400
and then just grew it a much more from there.

07:05.680 --> 07:08.880
But it's essentially the same concept you talk about all the time.

07:09.080 --> 07:12.040
I just tweaked it where I didn't own the site.

07:12.040 --> 07:16.240
They own the site and they just pay me each month to build it and improve it.

07:16.800 --> 07:20.680
And that's how I got the easy wins

07:21.040 --> 07:24.560
because I needed the fast, easy wins to to quit my job.

07:24.600 --> 07:28.040
And so that's that's the route I took and it's worked really well.

07:28.400 --> 07:32.640
And then from there, you know, build the systems to get more sales faster,

07:33.760 --> 07:36.400
more websites, build faster and just build it up.

07:36.560 --> 07:39.600
So that's kind of the high level overview.

07:39.880 --> 07:42.360
I want to go into questions I know everyone's asking.

07:42.360 --> 07:44.600
Number one, does it worry you?

07:45.000 --> 07:46.400
By the way, I've asked you these questions.

07:46.400 --> 07:48.480
So I know you're going to be like, do I ask this again?

07:48.480 --> 07:51.040
But from somebody that's just hearing you,

07:51.320 --> 07:54.760
does it not worry you that your clients have the control

07:54.760 --> 07:56.320
where they can just cancel at any point?

07:56.320 --> 07:58.600
Why doesn't that worry you or does it worry you?

07:58.600 --> 08:01.360
How are you kind of like hedging your bet against that?

08:04.000 --> 08:06.400
Yeah, that's a great question.

08:06.400 --> 08:09.200
Business owners need a website

08:09.520 --> 08:12.600
and they need someone they can trust.

08:13.200 --> 08:15.840
Most business owners, they're too busy

08:16.400 --> 08:19.840
doing plumbing or electrical work or cleaning carpets.

08:20.480 --> 08:23.680
They don't have the time and they don't want to worry about their online,

08:23.960 --> 08:25.560
their website, their stuff online.

08:25.560 --> 08:28.320
So they know they need a website.

08:28.400 --> 08:32.200
They know they're going to get the website will pay for itself.

08:32.200 --> 08:36.480
And if it ranks better, it's going to weigh more than 10x pay for itself.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.280
As we'll go on Google, people just like when they need their carpet

08:41.280 --> 08:44.160
cleaned, when they need a plumber, they're just going to Google it.

08:44.160 --> 08:47.560
So business owners, they know they need a website.

08:48.560 --> 08:51.800
And they're going to pay someone for that.

08:52.400 --> 08:54.760
So it might as well be me, right?

08:55.320 --> 09:01.360
Very rarely do I lose clients because as long as they're in business,

09:01.360 --> 09:04.040
I've had, I've lost some clients where the guy's like, hey, I'm retiring.

09:04.320 --> 09:05.400
I'm not selling the business.

09:05.400 --> 09:07.200
I'm not, my son doesn't want to take it over.

09:07.200 --> 09:08.280
The business is done.

09:08.320 --> 09:12.840
And it's like, okay, now the website, you know, I lost that client,

09:13.160 --> 09:17.080
but man, that's so rare because people are going to be in business

09:17.400 --> 09:22.040
for five, 10, 15, 20, 30 years, and they need a website.

09:22.640 --> 09:30.200
But it's, it's a pretty solid business model where when you explain things

09:31.040 --> 09:35.440
well, people trust you and they just know like you're their go-to guy.

09:36.040 --> 09:43.720
Um, now for these hundreds of businesses and they're like, oh yeah, it's just

09:43.720 --> 09:45.080
like, it's a monthly expense.

09:45.080 --> 09:46.080
It's like my phone bill.

09:46.440 --> 09:48.160
It's like my TV subscription.

09:48.160 --> 09:49.120
It's like my website.

09:49.200 --> 09:53.120
It's just like, it's just a subscription that is mandatory for their company.

09:53.760 --> 09:54.720
And that's why I love it.

09:55.000 --> 10:00.240
Even if, you know, money's tight and they're like, Hey, um, we don't really,

10:00.520 --> 10:01.760
we can't really afford this.

10:02.080 --> 10:03.120
They're still going to have it up.

10:03.120 --> 10:06.520
And there's, you know, I might give them a reduced package, but they're

10:06.520 --> 10:08.880
still going to be with me because they need that website.

10:09.120 --> 10:10.560
They realize it's critical.

10:10.960 --> 10:12.200
So that's, that's why I like it.

10:13.120 --> 10:17.520
So essentially guys, Zach's using his brain.

10:17.760 --> 10:23.640
He's targeting people who are already planning on and used to spending that money.

10:24.320 --> 10:24.720
Right.

10:25.360 --> 10:29.920
If you've watched any amount of my content on this channel, I always talk

10:29.920 --> 10:34.160
about go after business owners who are already paying for leads.

10:34.960 --> 10:35.400
Why?

10:35.440 --> 10:37.760
Because they don't need to be sold.

10:37.760 --> 10:41.360
You don't need to convince them to spend money on leads.

10:41.640 --> 10:44.480
They already believe in the concept and the idea of spending money on leads.

10:44.480 --> 10:49.040
You just need to show them that your leads, your, uh, services are better

10:49.040 --> 10:50.680
than home advisor angels, whatever.

10:51.080 --> 10:56.560
So Zach, um, explain to everybody, cause you had a very similar experience

10:56.560 --> 10:59.960
as I did doing door-to-door sales, by the way, Zach did door-to-door sales.

10:59.960 --> 11:05.600
He sold a dish network and I wanted to tell you why he stumbled into this

11:05.600 --> 11:09.960
idea of selling to people that were already using the service, but I also

11:09.960 --> 11:13.560
want before he does that before anyone goes, oh my gosh, I, uh, I have

11:13.560 --> 11:14.680
to have sales experience.

11:14.680 --> 11:17.760
That's why these guys are, are no, no, no, no guys.

11:18.080 --> 11:23.760
We, we, we just happened to do door-to-door sales, but we've seen, I

11:23.760 --> 11:28.000
would say at this point over a hundred or hundreds of people that have taken

11:28.000 --> 11:33.080
what we teach and without any sales experience and it made a ton of money.

11:33.080 --> 11:39.000
In fact, um, Zach and I were just barely on a live like an hour ago with somebody

11:39.320 --> 11:41.040
that had zero sales experience.

11:41.080 --> 11:42.960
He's making $44,000 a month.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.680
Did Vinny have any sales experience?

11:46.600 --> 11:47.200
None.

11:47.520 --> 11:47.920
No.

11:48.080 --> 11:48.440
Okay.

11:48.520 --> 11:50.720
So I just want to say that because I know that's what everybody's thinking.

11:50.840 --> 11:52.320
Oh, it's cause they have sales experience.

11:52.560 --> 11:54.240
No, we're, we're the anomaly.

11:54.240 --> 11:59.320
So why should people, why should people target, target, uh, well, not why should

11:59.320 --> 12:02.600
they cause everyone knows that, but what made you decide to start targeting

12:02.600 --> 12:03.320
these kinds of people?

12:03.400 --> 12:04.880
It makes so much sense, dude.

12:04.880 --> 12:08.960
But when I was doing SEO, what I was doing is I was trying to target everybody.

12:10.000 --> 12:10.400
Right.

12:10.440 --> 12:13.280
I was like, well, I know this person has a business.

12:13.280 --> 12:16.520
Let me see if I was pitching these deals where I had to convince them.

12:16.520 --> 12:19.760
They needed, they needed SEO and they needed to use me.

12:19.760 --> 12:21.680
And it was like such an uphill battle.

12:21.680 --> 12:25.960
And then even when you got the deal, the first thing that went wrong, they were

12:25.960 --> 12:28.880
getting ready to cancel the service because they weren't used to paying that bill.

12:28.880 --> 12:30.440
So just tell everyone how you discovered that.

12:30.480 --> 12:32.000
And, uh, I mean, it's genius.

12:32.160 --> 12:36.840
And, and if you're doing it, Legion, if you're doing door to door alarms, door

12:37.240 --> 12:42.360
to door TV, if you're selling SEO, you should freaking follow what Zach's about to say.

12:44.920 --> 12:49.960
Yeah, this is like the golden nugget for me that finally clicked and everything

12:49.960 --> 12:52.480
went buck wild, essentially.

12:52.480 --> 12:56.880
I realized when I was in college and I was selling door to door, um, I was just

12:56.880 --> 13:03.280
getting people to switch from dish network to direct TV or Comcast or AT&T U

13:03.280 --> 13:06.040
verse, whatever they had, I would just get them to switch.

13:07.480 --> 13:08.560
I never watched TV.

13:08.600 --> 13:14.560
Like I didn't care about TV at all, but I knew that I could rebundle people's

13:14.560 --> 13:16.560
packages or I could switch them over.

13:17.080 --> 13:20.400
And they would go from paying $150 a month to 70.

13:21.200 --> 13:24.320
I would cut their bill in half and they would get the same channels

13:24.320 --> 13:26.000
plus NFL Sunday ticket, right?

13:26.160 --> 13:28.560
And so like they're getting more for half the money.

13:29.760 --> 13:30.840
And it was so easy.

13:30.880 --> 13:36.200
I would just, I would make about 250 or $300 a sale and get like three sales

13:36.200 --> 13:40.880
a day on average as a college student for a hundred days, I ended up making

13:40.880 --> 13:47.520
like 70,000 in three or four months doing this and the whole idea was if

13:47.520 --> 13:52.640
someone didn't have a TV subscription already, I would never make that sale

13:52.640 --> 13:56.480
because you got to sell them on paying 70 bucks a month when they're spending

13:56.480 --> 14:00.960
zero, that's a tough sale, but I could sell people, I would just sell savings.

14:01.000 --> 14:06.520
I would, I would transfer people and save them money all day long.

14:07.520 --> 14:11.520
So then I entered this same thing.

14:12.480 --> 14:14.200
And that's what I figured out, right?

14:14.280 --> 14:19.920
People that are already paying a company, a big marketing company, whoever,

14:20.840 --> 14:25.640
their local dude, they're paying yellow pages, they're paying whatever for their

14:25.640 --> 14:30.360
online presence, their website, they're paying, um, I don't know, Yelp, people

14:30.360 --> 14:34.200
pay, Angelo's people pay for their websites, people pay all sorts of stuff

14:34.200 --> 14:34.760
online, right?

14:35.520 --> 14:43.920
I would just find people who are paying for SEO and give them a better offer for

14:43.960 --> 14:46.080
the same price or a lower price.

14:46.760 --> 14:50.840
And people would just switch to me all day, same concept.

14:51.120 --> 14:57.120
And that's how I built, um, my whole company is just giving people a better

14:57.120 --> 14:57.760
experience.

14:57.800 --> 15:01.480
They're already used to studying the money, but why not get more bang for your

15:01.480 --> 15:06.520
buck and just start paying me instead of these other guys that don't care, don't

15:06.520 --> 15:10.320
know what they're talking about, aren't attentive to the details, don't have good

15:10.320 --> 15:14.720
systems built like, man, I'm just going to serve those people all day long.

15:15.000 --> 15:18.200
And it makes the sales easy and it makes your growth predictable.

15:18.280 --> 15:22.320
You're just like, of course I can add five, 10, 15 new clients a month.

15:22.960 --> 15:27.680
Um, because everyone I talked to wants to do this.

15:27.680 --> 15:29.520
They're already paid just like direct TV.

15:29.520 --> 15:30.600
They're already paying one 50.

15:30.760 --> 15:33.440
They might as well pay 70 and get more with me.

15:33.600 --> 15:34.920
Oh, they're already paying 500.

15:35.360 --> 15:39.960
They might as well pay 500 with me, but get a way better website, a new built,

15:40.000 --> 15:41.120
newly built website.

15:41.280 --> 15:42.240
It's going to rank better.

15:42.440 --> 15:45.000
I'm going to do their Google business profile stuff, which isn't being done.

15:45.000 --> 15:48.960
Like there's going to get a better service than they have for the same price.

15:48.960 --> 15:52.000
It's a no brainer and you just win people over all day long.

15:52.440 --> 15:55.520
So that's how I think about it.

15:55.920 --> 15:56.480
Makes sense.

15:56.480 --> 15:57.080
And it's the same.

15:57.120 --> 15:58.280
I had the same experience.

15:58.280 --> 16:01.280
I won't bore everyone, but I had a very similar experience.

16:01.280 --> 16:06.680
And that's why I always preach and say, target people that are already sold period.

16:07.000 --> 16:12.040
Um, real quick, before we keep going, um, hustler 80 says, Zach is

16:12.040 --> 16:13.560
selling low ticket SEO services.

16:13.560 --> 16:16.640
I thought SEO was around 1500 a month.

16:16.680 --> 16:20.800
Can you clarify if he is selling low ticket to get them to buy more services from you?

16:21.160 --> 16:26.160
So in hustler eighties mind, that's he's never heard of SEO being that cheap.

16:26.560 --> 16:28.880
Can you clarify exactly what you're offering?

16:28.880 --> 16:31.440
Which, uh, I think is a good question by the way.

16:33.360 --> 16:33.520
Yeah.

16:33.520 --> 16:34.200
Great question.

16:34.560 --> 16:36.160
A lot of people charge way more.

16:37.000 --> 16:40.840
My expenses are lower than those companies because I have international people

16:41.200 --> 16:43.880
working for me, um, which is awesome.

16:44.280 --> 16:48.400
And so our profit margin is insanely high because our costs are low and

16:48.400 --> 16:49.560
we deliver a great service.

16:49.800 --> 16:54.040
But yes, we build websites and do their SEO and their Google business profile

16:54.040 --> 16:59.880
optimization, usually for like around 500 bucks a month, some clients are more if

16:59.880 --> 17:05.320
we're doing additional things and yes, we can then upsell them to, um, other

17:05.320 --> 17:10.080
things that we offer, um, Facebook ads, like we've added other things on over

17:10.080 --> 17:18.840
time, um, but it's those easy wins and then they stay with you forever because

17:18.840 --> 17:23.560
you do a good job and you're like a great price and then you make great

17:23.560 --> 17:29.520
money because you're smart and have international talent that, um, is

17:29.520 --> 17:34.480
phenomenal and not as expensive as, as expensive as us labor.

17:34.720 --> 17:36.200
So great question.

17:36.360 --> 17:43.120
It's a business model that works super, super well because, um, most SEO

17:43.120 --> 17:46.960
companies charging 1500, 2000, 5,000, they see a lot of churn.

17:47.920 --> 17:49.200
I just have a lot less churn.

17:49.760 --> 17:53.320
People are with me for years and years and years.

17:53.960 --> 17:56.120
And I just, I just had a thought, bro.

17:56.120 --> 17:59.480
It's kind of like what's, and this is to answer your question,

17:59.520 --> 18:01.120
um, Hunter or hustler eight.

18:01.880 --> 18:04.240
It's kind of like insurance, right?

18:04.240 --> 18:06.280
So you, I'm sure everyone's act.

18:06.280 --> 18:08.280
Have you ever been pitched on whole life insurance?

18:10.480 --> 18:10.880
Yeah.

18:11.040 --> 18:11.320
Okay.

18:11.320 --> 18:12.080
Everybody has, right?

18:12.080 --> 18:14.800
It's like everyone pitches whole life insurance because the insurance

18:14.800 --> 18:16.800
guys get paid crazy commissions.

18:17.160 --> 18:19.040
Basically whole life insurance.

18:19.040 --> 18:20.160
There's a bunch of perks.

18:20.160 --> 18:22.560
You can, you can take out a loan against it.

18:22.560 --> 18:24.360
You can all kinds of different stuff, right?

18:25.160 --> 18:28.240
There's that, which is what everyone wants to target because they get these

18:28.240 --> 18:30.400
big commissions and these big jobs, whatever.

18:31.480 --> 18:35.560
And Zach's basically the guy that's like, Hey, you guys can go and chase all that.

18:35.560 --> 18:38.240
You guys can go fight over all the whole life insurance deals.

18:38.720 --> 18:43.560
I'm going to go target everyone that has life insurance, just a policy, a term

18:43.560 --> 18:46.240
policy, which is 50, 60, 70 bucks a month.

18:46.600 --> 18:47.040
Why?

18:47.040 --> 18:52.080
Because I know for me personally, I have a policy with Northwestern mutual.

18:52.080 --> 18:53.200
That's like 50 bucks a month.

18:53.520 --> 18:55.360
I've been paying for it since 2018.

18:55.360 --> 18:56.160
I don't touch it.

18:56.160 --> 18:57.000
I don't think about it.

18:57.000 --> 19:01.000
It's just a bill that is, and I will always keep Zach would be the person

19:01.000 --> 19:02.960
would come along and say, Hey, I know you already have term.

19:03.120 --> 19:07.480
Let me show you how I can, you can work with me and it's a better option.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.920
And I've already, I'm used to this bill.

19:10.720 --> 19:12.600
He's not selling me on this additional bill.

19:12.680 --> 19:14.800
He's just targeting people like me that already have term.

19:15.040 --> 19:18.880
He's going for those low ticket, set it and forget it bills that are just a bill.

19:19.280 --> 19:24.760
And he's just figured out a way to use international talent, AKA VA is to go

19:24.840 --> 19:29.000
scrape the internet, find a whole bunch of people that have it go and, and sell

19:29.000 --> 19:33.880
them on using his service, put him into, put them into his system and rinse and

19:33.880 --> 19:37.760
repeat, is that, is that a pretty decent way of describing it or is that my way off?

19:40.120 --> 19:41.120
Yeah, man, you nailed it.

19:41.760 --> 19:48.200
Um, and the other thought there is like, you're building durable revenue.

19:48.480 --> 19:52.920
That's what I love about this business model is it's a subscription.

19:54.080 --> 19:59.120
Most businesses, service businesses, they got to go out and like earn

19:59.120 --> 20:01.920
the next dollar every day with this.

20:02.320 --> 20:06.960
It's like, you have a recurring client base that trusts you and likes you.

20:07.680 --> 20:12.560
And that creates the foundation, but then, yeah, as you build your company,

20:12.560 --> 20:14.840
you can upsell to other things.

20:15.040 --> 20:18.640
And then it's like, you have no sales cost.

20:18.840 --> 20:24.560
It's like all of a sudden, boom, you upsell them on Facebook ads or on, um,

20:24.600 --> 20:28.720
your CRM system on, you know, whatever you want to offer in the future.

20:29.080 --> 20:32.240
And you have these clients that trust you, you're in the door.

20:32.280 --> 20:36.360
You got that easy win and you can stack that and make an amazing company.

20:36.840 --> 20:40.000
And then if you want to crush it even further, like we're doing is like, cool.

20:40.000 --> 20:43.760
Now these people that trust us, when they ask about whatever, boom, we can fulfill

20:43.760 --> 20:48.120
that need and we grow with those clients and it's pretty phenomenal.

20:48.120 --> 20:52.120
I think the hardest thing is getting the first deal.

20:52.160 --> 20:55.960
That's why there are less entrepreneurs in the world than there could be is

20:55.960 --> 20:57.640
people don't get like that first deal.

20:58.040 --> 21:01.200
And so you want the bar, the barrier of entry in my mind.

21:01.200 --> 21:03.680
I was like, how can I lower that bar?

21:04.560 --> 21:08.880
So I'm going for the easiest wins possible to start stacking the money.

21:09.640 --> 21:10.760
And that's how I quit my job.

21:11.000 --> 21:14.520
And now we just keep stacking and then we stack and expand.

21:14.520 --> 21:18.560
And that's how we build the empire is little by little easy wins.

21:18.760 --> 21:19.800
Boom, that expand.

21:19.920 --> 21:23.640
Cause now you have the trust and easy upsells wherever you want.

21:23.720 --> 21:24.040
So.

21:25.880 --> 21:26.320
Amazing.

21:26.720 --> 21:31.040
Um, another question, what strategies do you recommend for attracting and

21:31.040 --> 21:35.040
retaining clients in the competitive field of websites?

21:35.040 --> 21:40.080
Well, first, just to clarify, this is the, we're not, I, if Zach reached

21:40.080 --> 21:43.640
it out to somebody and they do have a crappy website or they need a website,

21:43.640 --> 21:47.920
he'll offer it, but he's targeting people that are paying that monthly fee.

21:48.440 --> 21:52.440
And maybe working in that, uh, that website as part of it is not just

21:52.440 --> 21:57.440
targeting people that just need a website as a one-time bill, but I get your question.

21:57.440 --> 22:01.320
So Zach, what are, what are some strategies that you recommend?

22:01.320 --> 22:03.320
By the way, I dropped this already.

22:03.320 --> 22:04.160
I'll drop it again.

22:04.400 --> 22:08.840
If you guys want to check out more of what Zach's up to, he actually does

22:08.840 --> 22:13.320
have, uh, some stuff that he, that he trains and you can check it out on

22:13.320 --> 22:17.800
this website where he goes over like his A to Z process, but for the sake of

22:17.800 --> 22:22.480
this call, what, what are some strategies that you use to attract or reach out

22:22.480 --> 22:26.320
to those people that you want to target those easy wins?

22:28.240 --> 22:33.480
Yeah, I love this question because the gears are turning, right?

22:34.440 --> 22:37.600
And I think the biggest obstacle is irrelevance.

22:38.480 --> 22:40.520
People don't know that you exist.

22:41.240 --> 22:46.080
There's millions of business owners that if they knew you had the skills and knew

22:46.080 --> 22:52.520
who you were and knew your price, they would go with you, but you are, you,

22:52.760 --> 22:57.480
they don't know you, you are invisible in their minds, right?

22:57.680 --> 23:00.320
So the biggest thing is just contacts.

23:01.200 --> 23:03.720
I've used cold outreach a ton.

23:04.680 --> 23:08.120
I have teams in the Philippines that call business owners and they

23:08.120 --> 23:09.600
just find people that are unhappy.

23:09.960 --> 23:10.920
Do they have accents?

23:10.920 --> 23:13.080
Yeah, a little bit, but that's fine.

23:13.400 --> 23:16.760
They're finding people who are unhappy with their current situation.

23:17.280 --> 23:19.800
They set them up for my closers or used to be me.

23:20.040 --> 23:21.480
They set up the appointment for me.

23:22.080 --> 23:25.800
I talked with that business owner who I already know is unhappy with

23:25.800 --> 23:27.840
their online presence, their website.

23:29.600 --> 23:31.840
They're unhappy and that's an easy win.

23:32.160 --> 23:35.520
So in the beginning I would do the, I would do the cold calls.

23:35.520 --> 23:38.360
You know, I would just call business owners and talk with them.

23:39.240 --> 23:43.560
The thing is just asking them questions and digging in when they answer the

23:43.560 --> 23:45.360
phone to start a conversation.

23:45.600 --> 23:47.040
Hey, see that you're in this area.

23:47.400 --> 23:48.880
Um, I help companies.

23:48.880 --> 23:50.120
I live local, whatever.

23:50.440 --> 23:52.600
Um, what are your thoughts on like how you guys are doing online?

23:52.840 --> 23:54.080
What are your thoughts on your website?

23:54.640 --> 23:56.000
What do you guys want to do better?

23:56.800 --> 23:57.840
Do you guys want to grow?

23:58.120 --> 24:01.840
And if you start having conversations, it can be over the phone.

24:02.160 --> 24:07.200
Um, it can be over email, but just learning about companies.

24:07.240 --> 24:09.080
Now they know that you're even an option.

24:09.640 --> 24:11.400
So I think that's to answer your question.

24:11.400 --> 24:14.680
What strategies do you recommend for attracting and retaining to

24:14.680 --> 24:16.640
attract, they need to know you.

24:16.880 --> 24:18.600
So you need to do way more outreach.

24:18.600 --> 24:23.320
You need to, if you're talking with five companies a day and not having much

24:23.320 --> 24:28.960
success, go talk with 20 comp, 20 business owners a day, and it's

24:28.960 --> 24:30.280
just a numbers game, right?

24:30.440 --> 24:34.160
If more people know about you and know what you do, you'll get better at reaching

24:34.160 --> 24:34.400
out.

24:34.400 --> 24:38.680
So your conversion rates will get higher and higher over time, but

24:40.040 --> 24:41.720
we'll even know that you're an option.

24:42.600 --> 24:50.200
The biggest thing is it's like irrelevance or, um, not even knowing

24:50.200 --> 24:51.240
about you, right?

24:51.240 --> 24:52.400
You need to be known.

24:52.680 --> 24:54.400
So you need to do outreach every day.

24:54.760 --> 24:58.600
You or your team calling business owners, emailing business owners,

24:58.880 --> 25:01.520
reaching out and Facebook groups, however you want to reach out.

25:01.520 --> 25:04.720
I don't care, but you need to talk with people.

25:04.880 --> 25:05.960
You need to care about them.

25:06.840 --> 25:07.880
You need to listen to them.

25:08.200 --> 25:11.200
And if they feel heard, then they'll listen to you.

25:11.760 --> 25:12.920
First, you listen to them.

25:12.920 --> 25:13.760
You understand them.

25:14.040 --> 25:16.760
And then you're able to say, Hey, here are my recommendations based on what I

25:16.760 --> 25:19.480
saw and what I found with your website and your online presence.

25:19.800 --> 25:20.640
Here's what I recommend.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.000
What's your current situation?

25:22.000 --> 25:23.800
How much are you currently paying for everything online?

25:24.160 --> 25:25.160
Oh, we pay this for this.

25:25.160 --> 25:25.840
We pay this for this.

25:25.840 --> 25:26.600
We pay this for this.

25:26.920 --> 25:27.720
Okay, cool.

25:28.080 --> 25:28.920
What if we do this?

25:28.960 --> 25:31.640
Let's do this all way better for this price.

25:31.840 --> 25:32.680
We'll start here.

25:32.920 --> 25:36.240
Uh, once we know that down, we'll then work on your ads and we'll do this.

25:36.280 --> 25:38.960
And boom, now you have another client.

25:39.000 --> 25:45.320
So, I mean, a lot of cold outreach, if you join, you can join local BNI groups,

25:45.320 --> 25:49.680
you can do whatever, but you just need to be talking and connecting with business

25:49.680 --> 25:52.160
owners on a consistent basis.

25:52.400 --> 25:54.120
And then your growth is automatic.

25:56.120 --> 26:01.880
And one other thing too, just as I think I mentioned at the beginning, the thing

26:01.920 --> 26:06.200
that you can be very, you can do is you can be very strategic too, at the type

26:06.240 --> 26:11.280
of clients, the type of businesses that you actually go after and you work with.

26:11.280 --> 26:15.400
So if your goal, you're on this channel, your goal is to actually own

26:15.400 --> 26:17.200
assets and to rent them out.

26:18.400 --> 26:19.360
That's great.

26:19.800 --> 26:24.240
Go and get a handful, go get 20 clients that pay you 500 bucks a month.

26:24.240 --> 26:26.600
You have a $10,000, $10,000 per month.

26:27.040 --> 26:29.040
Your margins are going to be ridiculously high.

26:29.040 --> 26:31.640
You're probably going to be making 9,000 of that or 8,000 of that.

26:31.680 --> 26:37.680
Even if you have a VA and you can go now to these 20 clients and go and sell them

26:37.680 --> 26:39.480
lead generation services on the backend.

26:39.480 --> 26:45.080
So if you have a bunch of clients in the concrete space or the duct cleaning

26:45.080 --> 26:50.000
space or the masonry space, et cetera, you can now go and you can sell them a

26:50.000 --> 26:53.120
lead gen as well on that note.

26:54.480 --> 26:59.200
What I was going to ask you is, shoot, I had a question regarding that.

27:02.520 --> 27:09.040
Oh, uh, I guess one of their thought, one other thought I'll add to that is like

27:09.800 --> 27:13.400
over time you'll get a better and better at reaching out.

27:13.640 --> 27:19.960
Now I have very targeted campaigns to reach out to, you know, people that are

27:19.960 --> 27:23.920
already paying big marketing companies and I'll get lists of big marketing

27:23.920 --> 27:25.520
companies and we'll target those people.

27:25.520 --> 27:28.320
Find unhappy ones, switch them over, switch them over.

27:28.720 --> 27:33.800
I'll find people that are local to where I live in certain niches that I like to

27:33.800 --> 27:36.920
work with, you know, maybe it's like HVAC companies are good.

27:37.160 --> 27:39.560
Maybe I have experienced cleaning carpets.

27:39.560 --> 27:40.960
My dad owns a carpet cleaning company.

27:41.240 --> 27:42.880
I'm able to speak that language really well.

27:43.760 --> 27:47.080
I'm going to pull a list of local carpet cleaners in Arizona where I live.

27:47.320 --> 27:49.760
And now we have connections that those are easy wins.

27:50.120 --> 27:54.360
So think about your strengths and think about how you can get easy

27:54.360 --> 27:56.880
wins and easy switches to you.

27:57.320 --> 28:00.520
And you'll just stack a monthly recurring revenue.

28:01.880 --> 28:06.240
The other thing about SEO is every single person on this planet that owns

28:06.240 --> 28:14.720
a business you can sell to right at the right price, you can sell SEO to anybody.

28:15.000 --> 28:19.120
And I'm not saying that you should, but you could sell SEO to the person that

28:19.120 --> 28:24.000
owns this company that makes these water bottles or the person that cleans this

28:24.000 --> 28:28.480
office, you know, with lead generation, you have to be a lot more targeted.

28:28.520 --> 28:33.360
So it is nice because anybody that you talk to, even if let's say you, you, you

28:33.360 --> 28:38.760
find somebody, you can sell them SEO, but it's a really competitive city.

28:39.120 --> 28:43.360
It doesn't matter because as long as you charge enough money for that SEO,

28:43.840 --> 28:45.840
you're you it's still money.

28:45.960 --> 28:48.360
Um, so anyway, that's number one.

28:48.360 --> 28:51.400
Number two is I remember when I was going to ask you real quick, and I know you

28:51.400 --> 28:54.880
got to get off for a second, but what is your pro on an average client?

28:54.880 --> 28:55.920
What's your profit margin?

28:55.920 --> 28:57.840
Let's say you make it 500 bucks a month gross.

28:58.080 --> 29:01.840
How much of that are you putting in your pocket out of your 58,000 a month?

29:02.400 --> 29:04.440
How much of that is, is actual profit?

29:07.200 --> 29:08.600
So, yeah, great question.

29:09.520 --> 29:14.720
In the beginning, it was a lot higher, um, because I was doing the sales.

29:14.720 --> 29:17.240
I was, um, involved in the business more.

29:17.240 --> 29:19.360
It was like 70 or 80% profit margin.

29:19.920 --> 29:27.440
Now, um, I have like an SDR team, a sales team, um, website building team, SEO

29:27.440 --> 29:30.360
team, everything's built and just runs.

29:30.800 --> 29:35.480
Um, you know, I have the support team, everything is just dialed in, um, day

29:35.480 --> 29:40.240
to day, there's not honestly a ton for me to do except new things that I want to

29:40.240 --> 29:45.480
implement margin is like 30, 40%.

29:45.880 --> 29:54.000
Um, so, and on top of that, we cross sell our clients to other businesses with

29:54.000 --> 29:57.680
high profit margins, more like the 70, 80% profit margins.

29:58.280 --> 30:01.640
Um, so yeah, it's a pretty good, pretty good system.

30:03.240 --> 30:08.680
If you, by the way, last thing I want to say, uh, hustler 80, for example,

30:08.680 --> 30:13.000
if you were to go and build a business right now of 20 clients, 500 bucks a

30:13.000 --> 30:15.800
month average client, you were going to do all the work.

30:16.320 --> 30:19.840
You could probably have 90% profit margins.

30:20.360 --> 30:22.800
Like that's not unrealistic.

30:23.080 --> 30:24.080
You wouldn't be doing the work.

30:24.080 --> 30:26.280
You wouldn't be doing the updates on the websites, but that'd be manageable.

30:27.040 --> 30:29.840
Once you start to scale, you're going to have to bring on people.

30:29.840 --> 30:30.920
You're going to have to put in systems.

30:30.920 --> 30:32.200
You're going to have to do some of these things.

30:32.480 --> 30:35.920
And as you scale, your profits going to go down, but you're also scaling.

30:35.920 --> 30:38.640
And, and I know Zach, for example, he doesn't have to do a lot of

30:38.640 --> 30:40.520
the actual work himself.

30:40.520 --> 30:44.760
So anyway, Zach has got to jump onto another call here in three minutes.

30:44.760 --> 30:45.440
I'm going to let him go.

30:45.440 --> 30:50.680
But guys, if you want to check out more of what Zach's up to, go to Zach pile.co.

30:50.680 --> 30:52.040
I dropped it a couple of times in the chat.

30:52.080 --> 30:53.360
Hustler 80s had got his grade.

30:53.360 --> 30:57.080
I've been searching for SEO coach like Zach, and here he is live right on my

30:57.080 --> 30:58.320
break at work on a crazy coincidence.

30:58.320 --> 31:01.400
Either that's crazy or this guy's messing with us, but either way, that's cool.

31:02.720 --> 31:07.880
He might just, he might be feeding us, but, um, yeah, hustler 80 reach out to Zach.

31:08.240 --> 31:10.360
Maybe mention that your username is hustler 80.

31:10.360 --> 31:11.160
Appreciate you being on.

31:11.160 --> 31:12.960
Appreciate everybody being on guys.

31:12.960 --> 31:15.160
See your 20, 25, get out of the rat race.

31:15.200 --> 31:18.760
It's God didn't put you on this earth to just be under someone's thumb.

31:18.800 --> 31:21.400
Get your freedom and live the life you want to live.

31:21.400 --> 31:22.440
Zach, thanks for being on the call.

31:22.440 --> 31:24.720
We'll see you guys when I go live again.

31:24.760 --> 31:25.240
Thanks man.

31:26.840 --> 31:27.440
Thanks Nick.

31:27.520 --> 31:27.840
Later.
