00:00.000 --> 00:02.580
["Money, Love, Speed"]

00:10.520 --> 00:13.080
Guys, welcome to Money, Love, Speed.

00:13.080 --> 00:14.360
And we're gonna talk really quickly.

00:14.360 --> 00:16.800
I'm gonna share what the one-pager is,

00:16.800 --> 00:20.040
why we use it, and then when we should use it.

00:20.040 --> 00:21.200
Okay, I'm gonna go really quick.

00:21.200 --> 00:22.040
We're gonna get this done,

00:22.040 --> 00:23.840
because guys, let's go make some money.

00:23.840 --> 00:25.320
Number one, what it is.

00:25.320 --> 00:26.200
Very, very simple.

00:26.200 --> 00:29.360
Think about a website and think about the home page, okay?

00:29.360 --> 00:31.240
So, we're not gonna build that entire website.

00:31.240 --> 00:33.760
We're not gonna have service pages, location pages,

00:33.760 --> 00:35.200
about us, all that crap.

00:35.200 --> 00:36.280
We're not going to do that.

00:36.280 --> 00:39.720
We are gonna build a one-page landing page

00:39.720 --> 00:41.760
that we're gonna send traffic to,

00:41.760 --> 00:44.120
and that traffic is gonna convert into leads,

00:44.120 --> 00:46.700
and we're gonna do the least amount of work possible,

00:46.700 --> 00:48.160
the minimal viable product.

00:48.160 --> 00:49.580
We're gonna just have enough

00:49.580 --> 00:50.960
where people are gonna hit the website

00:50.960 --> 00:52.760
and they're gonna call the phone, fill out the form,

00:52.760 --> 00:54.560
we're gonna generate leads, okay?

00:54.560 --> 00:56.280
It's very simple, don't overthink it.

00:56.280 --> 00:59.160
Just think about a regular website, a home page, okay?

00:59.160 --> 01:01.600
There are certain things that we do need to include

01:01.600 --> 01:04.040
on this home page, and I'm gonna go over those,

01:04.040 --> 01:05.440
but everything outside of that,

01:05.440 --> 01:06.840
you don't need to worry about that.

01:06.840 --> 01:09.500
I will tell you, it is worth your time

01:09.500 --> 01:11.520
taking your time building your template

01:11.520 --> 01:13.320
for this first go-around.

01:13.320 --> 01:15.800
Then after that, you can literally copy and paste it

01:15.800 --> 01:18.700
and switch out the content, switch out the words,

01:18.700 --> 01:20.480
switch out the, or just the same thing,

01:20.480 --> 01:22.040
switch out the background image,

01:22.040 --> 01:23.120
switch out the phone number,

01:23.120 --> 01:25.300
and it becomes very quick and easy, okay?

01:25.300 --> 01:26.900
So, that's what a one-pager is,

01:26.900 --> 01:29.660
and some of you guys are watching this video

01:29.660 --> 01:33.300
and you are going to go pre-sell a site, okay?

01:33.300 --> 01:34.380
Great, welcome.

01:34.380 --> 01:37.580
Some of you guys went and you sold a site

01:37.580 --> 01:38.620
that you already had,

01:38.620 --> 01:41.940
and now you're getting ready to pre-sell a site, okay?

01:41.940 --> 01:45.220
There's gonna be multiple different reasons why you're here,

01:45.220 --> 01:47.360
but this is what you're going to do, okay?

01:47.360 --> 01:48.200
So, why do we do it?

01:48.200 --> 01:49.760
Well, number one is speed.

01:50.620 --> 01:52.860
We want to do this as quickly as possible.

01:52.860 --> 01:54.380
We wanna do this as quickly as possible,

01:54.380 --> 01:56.020
as cheaply as possible,

01:56.020 --> 01:58.560
because, as I've said many, many, many times,

01:58.560 --> 02:00.900
money loves speed, okay?

02:00.900 --> 02:02.460
So, we wanna do that as quickly as possible,

02:02.460 --> 02:04.620
and that is why we're going to be building the one-pager.

02:04.620 --> 02:06.260
So, speed, speed, speed.

02:06.260 --> 02:08.260
Secondly, we are gonna be building this

02:08.260 --> 02:09.500
on what's called a sub-domain.

02:09.500 --> 02:12.660
So, we're gonna be doing a .wix, a .weebly,

02:12.660 --> 02:14.340
whatever, you could use WordPress.

02:14.340 --> 02:17.500
We're gonna be doing this on a sub-domain,

02:17.500 --> 02:20.440
and what that means is we don't have to pay for the domain.

02:20.440 --> 02:22.860
So, instead of having to go buy the, you know,

02:22.860 --> 02:27.020
cedarcityconcrete.com or minneapolisconcrete.com,

02:27.020 --> 02:30.500
this is gonna be minneapolisconcrete.weebly.com,

02:30.500 --> 02:31.500
and we're not gonna have to pay for it.

02:31.500 --> 02:33.900
So, speed, cost.

02:33.900 --> 02:35.740
The other thing that's really awesome about this

02:35.740 --> 02:37.460
is it allows us to test the market

02:37.460 --> 02:39.580
without having ongoing recurring costs.

02:39.580 --> 02:40.900
So, it has kind of a combination

02:40.900 --> 02:42.660
between the other two things that I said.

02:42.660 --> 02:43.900
We're gonna be able to build this one-pager

02:43.900 --> 02:45.620
for very little time, very little money,

02:45.620 --> 02:48.580
and quickly go and test the market,

02:48.580 --> 02:50.220
and if it doesn't work,

02:50.220 --> 02:51.580
we spend a little bit of money on ads,

02:51.580 --> 02:52.420
and there's no buyers,

02:52.420 --> 02:53.900
or we spend a little bit of money on ads,

02:53.900 --> 02:55.220
and no one calls,

02:55.220 --> 02:57.500
we didn't spend all of our time, effort, and money

02:57.500 --> 02:59.100
building out a full website.

02:59.100 --> 03:00.900
So, those are just a couple of reasons

03:00.900 --> 03:04.060
why this is such a valuable tool.

03:04.060 --> 03:06.940
The thing I love the most, above all, is the speed.

03:06.940 --> 03:08.820
The fact that I could literally look at a project

03:08.820 --> 03:12.220
and say, hey, I need a one-pager in Minneapolis

03:12.220 --> 03:14.580
for concrete, and I could have that one one-hour's time,

03:14.580 --> 03:16.260
and I would have no money spent into it.

03:16.260 --> 03:18.460
That is a amazing thing, okay?

03:18.460 --> 03:21.440
So, that's what it is, why we do it,

03:21.440 --> 03:25.920
and then thirdly is, when should you do the one-pager?

03:25.920 --> 03:27.280
Okay, when should you do,

03:27.280 --> 03:28.880
when should you utilize these one-pagers?

03:28.880 --> 03:31.440
And it's up to you, this is your business.

03:31.440 --> 03:34.240
You're free to go build out full sites, okay?

03:34.240 --> 03:36.240
You're free to do your homework on the niche in the city,

03:36.240 --> 03:38.000
and just go build the full Monty.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.200
That's you, if you hate money, go do that, okay?

03:41.200 --> 03:44.480
However, I'm gonna tell you that the answer to this

03:44.480 --> 03:48.920
is I use the one-pager every single time,

03:48.920 --> 03:50.000
every single time.

03:50.000 --> 03:50.920
Let me give you one example.

03:50.920 --> 03:54.200
So, we have a client right now, he's a masonry guy.

03:54.200 --> 03:57.320
We call him the other day, we're like, hey, are you happy?

03:57.320 --> 03:58.680
Just kinda checking in, he's like, yeah,

03:58.680 --> 03:59.520
everything's going great.

03:59.520 --> 04:01.440
He's like, I actually have a friend, he does excavation,

04:01.440 --> 04:02.960
he wants to use you guys,

04:02.960 --> 04:04.720
he wants to get some leads from you guys.

04:04.720 --> 04:06.560
So, keep the deals done, right?

04:06.560 --> 04:07.840
We're crushing it for this one guy,

04:07.840 --> 04:10.000
he referred us to his buddy, deal's done.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.720
We're like, okay, cool, what should we do?

04:11.720 --> 04:14.360
And in the past, I used to just like,

04:14.360 --> 04:16.600
because I got the deal, I'm like, oh, I'll just go

04:16.600 --> 04:18.800
and build out the website because we're using his money.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.720
The deal's already done, right?

04:20.760 --> 04:22.040
That's not what we do anymore.

04:22.040 --> 04:25.000
Now what we do is, I'm actually going to sign the deal,

04:25.000 --> 04:26.080
I'm gonna get his money,

04:26.080 --> 04:29.520
but before I go build out the full website,

04:29.520 --> 04:32.120
I'm actually, for the first at least three months,

04:32.120 --> 04:34.240
I'm gonna be running ads to a one-pager.

04:34.240 --> 04:36.360
Now, why would I do that if I already got the deal?

04:36.360 --> 04:39.160
Well, I'm not familiar with excavation.

04:39.160 --> 04:41.640
I don't know if that niche is going to really work

04:41.640 --> 04:43.000
in the city we're targeting.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.920
I just don't, part of my gut tells me

04:45.920 --> 04:48.080
that it's too commercial heavy

04:48.320 --> 04:50.920
and that most people are gonna know who to call.

04:50.920 --> 04:53.760
I don't know if it's gonna work.

04:53.760 --> 04:55.320
So instead of building out a full site,

04:55.320 --> 04:58.520
even though it's his money, I'd rather keep the money,

04:58.520 --> 05:03.280
use an MVP, what I mean by MVP is a minimal viable product,

05:03.280 --> 05:05.320
which is like a one-pager, okay?

05:05.320 --> 05:08.080
Use a one-pager that costs me no money, no time.

05:08.080 --> 05:10.920
I run it for three months, and if it's crushing it,

05:10.920 --> 05:13.800
okay, cool, in three months, we take some of the profits,

05:13.800 --> 05:15.440
we build out the full website, and we like,

05:15.440 --> 05:17.800
hey, this niche in this city works really well, okay?

05:17.800 --> 05:21.760
However, if we do this, and a couple months in,

05:21.760 --> 05:24.020
we find out, hey, the calls we're getting,

05:24.020 --> 05:26.080
they're not really the leads this guy's looking for.

05:26.080 --> 05:27.880
They're kind of just random stuff,

05:27.880 --> 05:30.320
people looking for jobs, whatever it is.

05:30.320 --> 05:33.320
Now I can go to him and say, hey, here's the deal.

05:33.320 --> 05:34.600
We have a six-month agreement,

05:34.600 --> 05:36.400
but this isn't really working.

05:36.400 --> 05:38.840
The niche city doesn't, you know, whatever.

05:38.840 --> 05:40.080
I didn't build out a full website.

05:40.080 --> 05:42.880
I don't have this hosting bill and this tracking number

05:42.880 --> 05:44.080
and all this stuff I gotta take care of.

05:44.080 --> 05:45.160
I didn't have to pay for the content.

05:45.160 --> 05:48.240
I didn't have to pay employees to build this out, right?

05:48.240 --> 05:50.400
And I still made a profit.

05:50.400 --> 05:53.780
So I use the one-pager every single deal.

05:53.780 --> 05:56.000
Even if it's a layup, hey, here's a referral,

05:56.000 --> 05:57.680
I use it because I wanna test it

05:57.680 --> 05:59.240
and make sure that I pick the right city.

05:59.240 --> 06:01.160
Maybe I'm looking at the Dallas-Fort Worth area

06:01.160 --> 06:02.760
and I have a guy that covers all the area,

06:02.760 --> 06:05.320
and he's like, hey, I would love to get leads in Arlington.

06:05.320 --> 06:06.840
Okay, cool, so what I'm gonna do

06:06.840 --> 06:07.920
is for the first couple months,

06:07.920 --> 06:09.860
even though I got the deal, it's a referral,

06:09.860 --> 06:12.660
I'm gonna go do a one-pager probably in Arlington,

06:12.660 --> 06:16.380
Plano, whatever cities that he's interested in,

06:16.380 --> 06:17.700
and I'm probably gonna run a test

06:17.700 --> 06:19.140
with these three different landing pages

06:19.140 --> 06:21.820
to see which one's getting me the cheapest, best leads.

06:21.820 --> 06:25.640
Okay, so just a few examples.

06:25.640 --> 06:28.880
One last thing that I really like to use this one-pager for

06:28.880 --> 06:31.940
is if I have a client in a big city, let's say Atlanta,

06:31.940 --> 06:33.800
and we got the deal, I did the one-pager,

06:33.800 --> 06:36.340
we went through the process, I got the deal.

06:36.340 --> 06:39.060
But two months later, something happens

06:39.060 --> 06:40.620
that's not ranking that quick,

06:40.620 --> 06:41.780
and the business owner's like,

06:41.780 --> 06:43.860
Nick, I need more leads, or whatever,

06:43.860 --> 06:44.820
and they're kinda getting frustrated,

06:44.820 --> 06:46.520
I can tell they're getting frustrated.

06:46.520 --> 06:48.380
What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go and research

06:48.380 --> 06:50.100
some of the suburbs around Atlanta,

06:50.100 --> 06:53.100
so Norcross, Marietta, maybe Flowery Branch,

06:53.100 --> 06:54.980
and I'm gonna do the homework on those.

06:54.980 --> 06:57.540
And then I'm gonna be able to go build one-pagers

06:57.540 --> 07:00.260
in Marietta, in Norcross, maybe in Flowery Branch,

07:00.260 --> 07:03.260
and run ads to those landing pages

07:03.260 --> 07:06.740
and supplement that deal, he doesn't even need to know,

07:06.740 --> 07:09.780
say hey, I'm just gonna keep pushing him leads,

07:09.780 --> 07:11.060
he doesn't know that it's coming

07:11.060 --> 07:12.020
from a separate landing page,

07:12.020 --> 07:13.700
they're all just gonna funnel to him,

07:13.700 --> 07:16.520
and it's a way that you can kind of increase the leads

07:16.520 --> 07:17.860
if things get a bit stagnant,

07:17.860 --> 07:20.320
and it's a beautiful way to use that one-pager.

07:20.320 --> 07:23.300
So there's a ton of application,

07:23.300 --> 07:25.800
there's a ton of use for these one-pagers,

07:25.800 --> 07:30.380
my biggest piece of advice is learn how to do this,

07:30.380 --> 07:34.020
build a kick-ass template, learn how to do it,

07:34.020 --> 07:37.220
master it, and then we can go to the next step,

07:37.220 --> 07:39.220
which is outsource it, but you are going to be using this

07:39.220 --> 07:41.660
on every single deal,

07:41.660 --> 07:44.320
because we are going to use other people's money

07:44.320 --> 07:45.340
to build our empire.
