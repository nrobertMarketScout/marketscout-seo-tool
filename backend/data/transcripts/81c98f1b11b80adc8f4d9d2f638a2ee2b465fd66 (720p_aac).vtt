00:00.000 --> 00:05.200
I think that a lot of the initial, so there's a thing I don't know what the term is. I call it

00:05.200 --> 00:13.840
like a card quality issue. So I would say do not use any type of debit card issued by a bank

00:15.360 --> 00:19.040
because I think I said it in a video or something that I posted a group.

00:20.640 --> 00:27.520
When you go and do that initial charge, it's coming from overseas. It's not coming from the

00:27.600 --> 00:32.880
United States. So if you're here and you're doing a charge wherever it's coming from,

00:34.240 --> 00:40.240
it could send a block. Now, they're so fast that as soon as they feel that, done, suspicious payment.

00:40.240 --> 00:46.240
They don't give you that. It's done so fast that you don't get like that. Today I got one on my

00:46.240 --> 00:52.160
phone for my AAH ref's charge. So every five or six months, I get a thing and they're like,

00:52.160 --> 00:55.840
hey, are you approving this? And I'm thinking like, yeah, no shit, it's a recurring payment.

00:55.840 --> 00:59.760
But for whatever reason, every five or six months, my credit card company makes sure

01:00.640 --> 01:03.360
that I approved it. But it's because it's coming from out of country.

01:05.040 --> 01:10.640
But with Google, it happens so fast that you get flagged right away and then there's nobody to talk

01:10.640 --> 01:16.640
to because there's nobody answering those phones. So if you have a debit card, those have a lot

01:16.640 --> 01:22.400
because that's protecting your cash right now. So they're going to have a more scrutiny on the

01:22.400 --> 01:26.720
security features with it. So that's one thing I've told a couple of students, like I wouldn't use

01:26.720 --> 01:27.360
your debit card.
