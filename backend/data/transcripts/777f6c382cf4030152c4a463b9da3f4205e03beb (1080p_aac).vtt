WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.520
I'm gonna go live and push stream, I'm already streaming I think.

00:10.520 --> 00:18.800
Start streaming.

00:18.800 --> 00:26.640
Alright Porter, let's check Facebook and see if we're live here.

00:26.640 --> 00:30.360
I think we are dude, let me see.

00:30.360 --> 00:31.360
Sure.

00:31.360 --> 00:34.880
Yeah it says you're live, yeah we're live.

00:34.880 --> 00:37.280
Okay dope.

00:37.280 --> 00:38.280
Alright.

00:38.280 --> 00:45.880
Let me go, I don't know why, oh there it is, boom.

00:45.880 --> 00:49.480
Okay dude, let's wait a second, we'll see if anyone comes up.

00:49.480 --> 00:53.400
Can you tag people on the stream like you can in a group or not?

00:53.400 --> 00:55.640
I don't know, let me see.

00:56.120 --> 01:00.680
Hey dude, let me try it, see hold on.

01:00.680 --> 01:05.400
I do add, yeah I think you can tag people, you can probably tag everybody.

01:05.400 --> 01:09.440
I'm trying to do tag everyone, trying to drop a comment on the stream and see if it will

01:09.440 --> 01:15.600
let me, oh there we go Porter's watching, that's, maybe it's app followers you do, yeah

01:15.600 --> 01:20.720
it's app followers, come check this out.

01:20.720 --> 01:25.080
Alright dope.

01:25.080 --> 01:29.360
Okay so, let's just jump into this dude, we gotta, I know you're doing stuff, you're,

01:29.360 --> 01:32.720
I mean tell everyone what you're doing by the way.

01:32.720 --> 01:38.520
I'll give you a nice little view, I'm weighing out some trucks right now so I am, oh geez

01:38.520 --> 01:39.560
I can't even.

01:39.560 --> 01:44.520
What does that mean for everyone, for 99% of people I have no idea what that means.

01:44.520 --> 01:48.560
So I'm weighing these trucks into this scale house, this is my guy, I gotta hop out, weigh

01:48.560 --> 01:50.400
him in and then I gotta weigh him out.

01:50.400 --> 01:53.440
This guy, you know what's funny dude, this guy drove clear to Mesquite and he forgot

01:53.440 --> 01:57.160
to get a weigh ticket and then he had to drive back.

01:57.160 --> 02:02.200
Okay you let that guy wait five minutes then, let's do a quick intro then I'll take care.

02:02.200 --> 02:08.760
We got Mr. Moin Gollum, what's up bro, Laura Shepard, you got a few people on, guys in

02:08.760 --> 02:12.120
this video, this little live that me and Porter are gonna do, Porter can you just be on for

02:12.120 --> 02:13.120
like five minutes?

02:13.120 --> 02:14.120
Yeah here we go.

02:14.120 --> 02:21.920
Okay, in this video what I wanna do is I actually just wanna go over, like just, first of all

02:21.920 --> 02:28.480
I wanna explain to you how much money you can actually make from renting a simple website.

02:28.480 --> 02:30.920
And if you don't know what I'm talking about with renting a simple website, I'm gonna

02:30.920 --> 02:32.560
explain that here in a second.

02:32.560 --> 02:35.680
And I'm not just gonna tell you, I'm gonna show you my Stripe account, I'm gonna show

02:35.680 --> 02:39.360
you some screenshots of some of my clients and like I'm actually gonna show you a list

02:39.360 --> 02:43.040
of like part of my clients.

02:43.040 --> 02:48.120
The reason being is because a lot of people that have seen these videos that Porter and

02:48.120 --> 02:52.520
I have done in the past, I think you see these videos and it's like, yeah it sounds

02:52.520 --> 02:56.360
like it's awesome but it kind of feels too good to be true.

02:56.360 --> 03:00.800
Would you say that that's, did you feel like that when you found out like I was doing this

03:00.800 --> 03:02.000
or what was your thoughts?

03:02.000 --> 03:08.160
Because I know that if I was from the outside looking in and somebody's like, yeah you can

03:08.160 --> 03:11.760
travel the world and do all this stuff and pay your bills renting out simple websites,

03:11.760 --> 03:15.240
I would probably be like, eh, I'm not sure I believe that.

03:15.920 --> 03:20.920
It seems like it's just like you want to believe that but at the same time you're like, can

03:20.920 --> 03:21.920
I do that?

03:21.920 --> 03:25.120
Like it doesn't seem like you're qualified enough to be able to make that kind of money.

03:25.120 --> 03:28.280
But did you think that it was actually real or did you think it was just like me making

03:28.280 --> 03:32.840
some fake screenshots on Stripe because I think that people actually do think that is

03:32.840 --> 03:33.840
the reality.

03:33.840 --> 03:39.200
I actually want to show you guys some screenshots of some clients that I have and that I've

03:39.200 --> 03:40.360
been working with for years.

03:40.360 --> 03:45.720
So anyway, I guess you probably didn't have that thought because you would assume I wouldn't

03:45.720 --> 03:46.720
lie to you.

03:46.720 --> 03:47.720
Yeah.

03:47.720 --> 03:48.720
I mean, I had a lot more.

03:48.720 --> 03:49.720
I had a lot more faith.

03:49.720 --> 03:50.720
Yeah.

03:50.720 --> 03:51.720
Okay.

03:51.720 --> 03:53.000
Well, anyway, so let's just do this really quick, dude.

03:53.000 --> 03:58.320
I want to just tell my story quickly, just catch people up, just literally 15 seconds.

03:58.320 --> 03:59.320
You the same.

03:59.320 --> 04:00.840
We'll tell people the model and then I'll let you hop off.

04:00.840 --> 04:06.360
So I do see Jerry, let's see, we've got Laura Shepard on there, Richard Martez, what's up?

04:06.360 --> 04:07.360
Jerry Ward.

04:07.360 --> 04:08.360
Good to see you, bro.

04:08.360 --> 04:09.360
We need to catch up by the way.

04:09.360 --> 04:11.240
We need to catch up when I was out of the country.

04:11.240 --> 04:12.240
Jimmy Carlson.

04:12.240 --> 04:13.240
Okay.

04:13.240 --> 04:18.400
So in a nutshell, guys, I used to do door to door sales.

04:18.400 --> 04:21.480
That was like the only job, the only real job I had.

04:21.480 --> 04:22.480
It wasn't even on payroll.

04:22.480 --> 04:24.580
It was knocking door to door.

04:24.580 --> 04:32.000
I realized that if I wanted to make real money, and again, that real money is defined by different

04:32.000 --> 04:36.800
people, but money where I would say seven figures plus, I needed to do something where

04:36.800 --> 04:38.480
I actually owned the thing.

04:38.480 --> 04:39.720
I couldn't be a salesperson.

04:39.720 --> 04:42.480
I couldn't be an employee.

04:42.480 --> 04:44.680
And so I'm like, I knew I needed to start a business.

04:44.680 --> 04:45.680
Didn't know what to do.

04:45.680 --> 04:46.680
Didn't know what to do.

04:46.680 --> 04:47.680
Didn't know what to do.

04:47.680 --> 04:48.680
I was asking everybody.

04:48.680 --> 04:49.680
I was taking people to lunch.

04:49.680 --> 04:50.680
All that.

04:50.680 --> 04:51.680
Just being that annoying guy.

04:51.680 --> 04:52.680
Like, hey, what should I do?

04:52.680 --> 04:53.680
What should I do?

04:53.680 --> 04:54.680
I don't know.

04:54.680 --> 04:55.680
And I was making decent money doing door to door sales.

04:55.680 --> 04:57.680
So I came across this business model.

04:57.680 --> 05:01.760
Somebody introduced me to this specific podcast and said, hey, you should check this out.

05:01.760 --> 05:07.000
Looked it up and it was talking about this idea where what you do is you pick a city,

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
you pick a niche.

05:08.520 --> 05:13.640
So for example, Para One Tree Service, you build a simple website and then you rank that

05:13.640 --> 05:15.560
website on Google.

05:15.560 --> 05:18.720
And from once it ranks, you're going to start getting phone calls.

05:18.720 --> 05:22.280
You take those phone calls and you sell the phone calls.

05:22.280 --> 05:24.160
So you're essentially a middleman.

05:24.160 --> 05:28.360
You are you're like a lead broker, right?

05:28.360 --> 05:29.360
So this is the model.

05:29.360 --> 05:34.400
It made perfect sense to me because they explained like once you do this, it's it's passive.

05:34.400 --> 05:37.140
You have these websites that are out on the Internet collecting phone calls and you're

05:37.140 --> 05:39.180
selling the leads and you're not even involved.

05:39.180 --> 05:41.140
It's passive business model.

05:41.140 --> 05:42.980
So I was completely hooked.

05:42.980 --> 05:48.500
Long story short, I got into this in 2016, been doing this nine years, made all the mistakes

05:48.500 --> 05:49.500
in the book.

05:49.500 --> 05:53.220
I've I've almost I almost quit doing it twice.

05:53.220 --> 05:57.460
Got distracted, tried to start a software company that didn't work.

05:57.460 --> 06:01.300
And then finally in 2020, I was like, you know what, Nick, you got to figure this out.

06:01.300 --> 06:04.700
Like you got to start actually making some some good money from this.

06:04.700 --> 06:05.700
This is the right model.

06:05.740 --> 06:07.060
You just got to put your head down.

06:07.060 --> 06:09.660
And we made some adjustments and we made some tweaks.

06:09.660 --> 06:12.500
We figured out a few things that I didn't know how to do.

06:12.500 --> 06:14.460
And everything changed.

06:14.460 --> 06:18.340
And since 2020, been making seven figures, one hundred thousand plus per month since

06:18.340 --> 06:22.380
2020. OK, Porter, tell everyone really quick how you how you got into it.

06:22.380 --> 06:26.340
And then we'll get into just showing some examples and letting people see that this

06:26.340 --> 06:28.380
is actually real. Perfect.

06:28.380 --> 06:33.100
So two years ago, when I got back from Colorado, I reached out to Nick.

06:33.340 --> 06:34.580
I just got married.

06:34.580 --> 06:37.660
And it was just kind of that point in my life where I was like, dude, I got to start

06:37.660 --> 06:40.940
making some more money, like rent's expensive, food's expensive.

06:40.940 --> 06:42.180
I mean, just everything in general.

06:42.180 --> 06:45.260
I just didn't realize what it took to, you know, live out on your own.

06:45.460 --> 06:48.380
And so that's kind of when I actually drew an interest in what you did.

06:48.380 --> 06:49.500
I was like, dude, what are you doing?

06:49.500 --> 06:51.580
I remember we had a conversation and you told it to me.

06:51.580 --> 06:55.740
And I was like, it almost like it didn't make sense because I was like, what?

06:55.740 --> 06:58.460
Like, that's all you did. And it kind of just was like this joke.

06:58.460 --> 07:00.460
I was like, are you serious? This is crazy.

07:00.460 --> 07:03.020
And then anyways, started doing it myself.

07:03.020 --> 07:04.500
And for a little bit, it was hard.

07:04.500 --> 07:07.780
It was just like my confidence, getting my confidence there of like, can I actually

07:07.780 --> 07:09.420
do this? I have zero sales experience.

07:09.420 --> 07:10.460
I have zero tech skills.

07:10.460 --> 07:12.540
Like, why should I be able to sell this?

07:12.540 --> 07:15.340
And you had been through summer sales, doing all these things.

07:15.660 --> 07:19.580
So like I knew I could do it and I knew that you were like capable of like,

07:19.580 --> 07:20.900
obviously this was real.

07:20.900 --> 07:24.580
But, you know, until I fully bought into it, that was kind of when I saw the results

07:24.580 --> 07:26.980
and it just changed my life.

07:26.980 --> 07:29.660
And just to just give an idea.

07:29.660 --> 07:34.420
So Porter, what's your what are you making per month doing this right now?

07:34.420 --> 07:36.500
Ten six right now, ten thousand six hundred.

07:36.500 --> 07:37.740
Ten thousand six hundred bucks.

07:37.740 --> 07:40.100
OK, so that's what Porter makes per month.

07:40.100 --> 07:41.860
By the way, this is not Porter's full time thing.

07:41.860 --> 07:45.780
As you can see, Porter is taking five minutes to jump on this call, but he's full

07:45.780 --> 07:48.260
time taking over the family farm, doing that.

07:48.260 --> 07:49.260
He likes to work with his hands.

07:49.260 --> 07:50.700
This is just a side thing for him.

07:50.700 --> 07:54.540
He does it during the winters and then he kind of maintains it during the summers

07:54.540 --> 07:56.700
when he's working on the family farm.

07:56.700 --> 07:58.940
So you don't have to do this full time.

07:58.940 --> 08:01.940
I personally started doing this while I was doing door to door sales.

08:01.940 --> 08:05.020
I've been doing this full time, though, for, you know, five, six, seven years.

08:05.300 --> 08:06.620
But you don't have to do this full time.

08:06.620 --> 08:09.700
OK, so what I'm going to do is this.

08:10.940 --> 08:12.580
Porter's making ten thousand six hundred bucks.

08:14.100 --> 08:18.340
Again, I wanted him to be out here to tell you that just because it sounds like

08:18.820 --> 08:22.580
when you think about the idea of building a simple website, it sound

08:22.580 --> 08:25.220
and then renting it out, it sounds like you're full of crap.

08:25.420 --> 08:26.380
That's that's the reality.

08:26.380 --> 08:27.060
And I understand that.

08:27.060 --> 08:30.180
So I'm going to be showing you a couple of examples on this call.

08:30.180 --> 08:31.340
I'm going to show you some screenshots.

08:31.340 --> 08:32.660
I know Porter's got to go here in a second.

08:32.660 --> 08:36.460
But just so you guys understand how this works is once you rank one of these websites.

08:36.460 --> 08:38.500
So let me just show one site, Porter, that you can bounce.

08:38.500 --> 08:40.540
OK, no, you're good.

08:40.540 --> 08:42.980
OK, let me show you guys this real quick.

08:42.980 --> 08:44.140
I'm going to share my screen.

08:45.660 --> 08:47.260
Hang on one second.

08:47.260 --> 08:51.340
I'm going to go to a good old Google dot com, and then I'm going to share my screen.

08:51.340 --> 08:54.420
I'm going to show everyone that has no idea what we're talking about, what this is.

08:54.420 --> 08:56.020
OK, you can see my screen.

08:56.780 --> 08:57.980
Yep, I can see it.

08:57.980 --> 08:59.780
So here's how simple the model is.

08:59.780 --> 09:02.460
Somebody goes to Google, they're in St.

09:02.460 --> 09:05.260
George, Utah. They're looking for concrete, right?

09:05.260 --> 09:06.180
They want a new patio.

09:06.180 --> 09:08.380
They want a basketball court.

09:08.380 --> 09:11.260
They want to extend their pool deck, whatever.

09:11.260 --> 09:12.540
They want to put in a sidewalk.

09:12.540 --> 09:15.500
They're going to go and they're probably going to go and type in concrete St.

09:15.500 --> 09:17.100
George. Pretty simple.

09:17.100 --> 09:18.340
St. George, concrete, concrete, St.

09:18.340 --> 09:19.580
George, concrete company.

09:19.580 --> 09:23.580
And what's going to happen is when you type this in, you're going to see these.

09:23.580 --> 09:25.060
These at the top are sponsored ads.

09:25.100 --> 09:27.900
OK, but if you go down here just a little bit, you're going to see these three

09:27.900 --> 09:31.660
listings here and then you're going to see underneath, you're going to have some

09:31.660 --> 09:35.740
more listings. OK, so if you see, I'm going to show you guys where I'm actually

09:35.740 --> 09:39.260
ranking and how much money I'm making from this, and it's going to surprise you.

09:39.260 --> 09:41.620
So if you can see this, this isn't my website.

09:41.620 --> 09:43.580
This isn't my website. This is actually my website.

09:43.580 --> 09:44.820
I'm ranked number three.

09:44.820 --> 09:46.060
I'm not even ranked number one.

09:46.060 --> 09:48.460
I'm also not ranked in the top three here.

09:49.300 --> 09:51.340
If you change this, sometimes it will change it.

09:51.340 --> 09:52.580
If you type in concrete St.

09:52.580 --> 09:53.100
George or St.

09:53.100 --> 09:54.860
George, concrete, sometimes if you switch it around.

09:54.860 --> 09:56.180
So now I'm number two.

09:56.180 --> 09:57.500
So it kind of depends.

09:57.500 --> 10:00.300
But I want you to understand, I'm not the first listing.

10:00.300 --> 10:03.340
OK, if you click on this site, somebody's in St.

10:03.340 --> 10:04.780
George are looking for concrete.

10:04.780 --> 10:06.540
They're going to come to this little website.

10:06.540 --> 10:08.420
Nothing pretty, nothing fancy.

10:08.420 --> 10:12.060
And if they call this phone number right here, I get paid.

10:13.780 --> 10:15.260
OK, this is tracked.

10:15.260 --> 10:17.220
It goes directly to the business owner.

10:17.220 --> 10:19.380
The phone rings. I get paid.

10:19.380 --> 10:21.540
If they fill this thing out right here.

10:21.540 --> 10:23.380
Hey, I want to get an estimate, blah, blah, blah.

10:23.380 --> 10:25.300
I get paid.

10:25.300 --> 10:26.140
And that's it. That's it.

10:26.140 --> 10:27.020
That's the whole model.

10:27.020 --> 10:30.340
Build a site, rank it on Google for things that people search.

10:30.340 --> 10:32.940
When people call the phone number, you get paid.

10:32.940 --> 10:34.740
Is there anything else I could explain

10:34.740 --> 10:36.860
that makes that even more simple?

10:36.860 --> 10:38.820
No, it's literally digital real estate.

10:38.820 --> 10:41.740
If you had an actual tenant in a rental house,

10:41.740 --> 10:44.100
that's the easiest way for me to explain it is like it's

10:44.100 --> 10:47.580
someone's renting the site from you every single month.

10:47.580 --> 10:49.460
So before Porter goes, let me show you guys.

10:49.460 --> 10:51.540
I just pulled this up on my this is my Stripe account.

10:51.540 --> 10:52.540
Literally pulled this up today.

10:52.540 --> 10:53.900
You can see right here, February.

10:53.900 --> 10:55.540
What is the date today?

10:55.540 --> 10:56.380
Nineteenth.

10:56.380 --> 10:58.100
Yeah, this is literally I do that.

10:58.100 --> 10:59.780
I screenshot this right before I jumped on.

10:59.780 --> 11:04.580
OK, so this one website that I just really showed you guys,

11:04.580 --> 11:07.780
you can see right here, I have made from this one singular

11:07.780 --> 11:10.820
client, I have made sixty four thousand one hundred and

11:10.820 --> 11:12.140
twenty five dollars.

11:12.140 --> 11:15.900
OK, I signed the client in November of twenty twenty one.

11:15.900 --> 11:18.060
Looks like we might have either had a pause

11:18.060 --> 11:19.580
or they missed a few payments right here.

11:19.580 --> 11:22.460
You could see my graph over here, my monthly revenue with them.

11:22.460 --> 11:24.700
They pay me one thousand six hundred and thirty dollars

11:24.700 --> 11:26.540
and fifty eight cents.

11:26.540 --> 11:29.340
It looks like I had to give one refund, which probably was we

11:29.340 --> 11:31.060
accidentally charged them twice.

11:31.060 --> 11:34.980
And you could see every single week I get paid three hundred

11:34.980 --> 11:35.900
and seventy five bucks.

11:35.900 --> 11:37.300
Boom, boom, boom.

11:37.300 --> 11:38.740
OK, let me see if I can go back to the site.

11:38.740 --> 11:40.180
Here's the site.

11:41.100 --> 11:43.220
So this little guy right here, St.

11:43.220 --> 11:48.260
George Concrete CEO dot com, in all of its glory, is ripping

11:48.260 --> 11:53.740
down one thousand six hundred and thirty dollars and fifty

11:53.740 --> 11:55.140
eight cents per month.

11:55.140 --> 11:56.540
Three hundred seventy five dollars a week.

11:56.540 --> 11:59.540
I don't know about you, but that could almost cover a house

11:59.540 --> 12:01.460
payment, depending on which part of the country.

12:01.460 --> 12:02.100
And maybe not anymore.

12:02.100 --> 12:03.380
Maybe that's like half a house payment now.

12:03.380 --> 12:06.260
But you get two sites, you get your house paid for your

12:06.260 --> 12:07.220
mortgage paid for.

12:07.220 --> 12:08.700
So this is what we do.

12:08.700 --> 12:10.460
So this is one of my sites I have.

12:10.460 --> 12:11.780
So I'll show one more screenshot, then I'll show a

12:11.780 --> 12:12.420
couple more examples.

12:12.420 --> 12:15.180
But Porter, let me just show you this, dude, or I guess

12:15.180 --> 12:16.300
everybody in here.

12:16.300 --> 12:18.060
Here's a well, actually, I'll let you go, dude.

12:18.060 --> 12:18.860
Do you have anything you want to add?

12:18.860 --> 12:22.820
I know you got to go and do your real job, but it's good to

12:22.820 --> 12:25.180
see that you can like Porter does this.

12:25.180 --> 12:26.300
He has leads coming in.

12:26.300 --> 12:29.060
He's trying to get his clothes and deals working with new

12:29.060 --> 12:31.980
business owners while he's working on the farm.

12:31.980 --> 12:34.900
And he's been able to scale this to ten thousand six

12:34.900 --> 12:37.700
hundred dollars per month in addition to what he's doing on

12:37.700 --> 12:38.740
the farm, which I think is amazing.

12:38.740 --> 12:39.500
Anything you want to add?

12:39.500 --> 12:40.060
No pressure.

12:40.060 --> 12:41.340
But if you do.

12:41.340 --> 12:43.220
No, I would just say anyone can do this.

12:43.220 --> 12:45.820
I used to think that I had to be sitting at a desk and I had

12:45.940 --> 12:48.100
all this free time to be able to make this work.

12:48.100 --> 12:50.740
But seriously, you can do this anywhere.

12:50.740 --> 12:52.300
Like you don't need to be sitting at a desk.

12:52.300 --> 12:54.460
Like I feel like I almost get more done.

12:54.460 --> 12:57.340
Like I'm just doing my everyday life and I'm continually

12:57.340 --> 12:59.580
sitting over leads, hooking business owners, getting on the

12:59.580 --> 13:01.220
phone and stuff like that.

13:01.220 --> 13:03.420
So anyone could do this and you don't need sales experience.

13:03.420 --> 13:04.420
That's like the biggest thing.

13:04.420 --> 13:06.780
I think a lot of people are like, I'm afraid to get on the

13:06.780 --> 13:08.340
phone. I've never done summer sales.

13:08.340 --> 13:11.020
Like I'm fresh out of high school, whatever it is.

13:11.020 --> 13:13.380
And it's like, dude, you don't just be yourself.

13:13.380 --> 13:16.620
There are certain people that you're going to be able to

13:16.620 --> 13:18.620
connect with that maybe I'm not going to be able to connect

13:18.620 --> 13:20.100
with. So anyways.

13:20.100 --> 13:22.700
Yeah. And just so everybody knows, when I first started

13:22.700 --> 13:25.460
doing this, I had zero experience with the computer.

13:25.460 --> 13:26.620
I didn't know how to build a website.

13:26.620 --> 13:28.620
I didn't know what SEO meant, which means search engine

13:28.620 --> 13:31.300
optimization. I didn't know what a domain was.

13:31.300 --> 13:34.420
I knew how to work on the farm and knock doors.

13:34.420 --> 13:36.740
That's it. That's all I knew how to do.

13:36.740 --> 13:38.860
I didn't know how to do sales.

13:38.860 --> 13:39.740
Well, actually, that's not true.

13:39.740 --> 13:40.900
I had done door-to-door sales.

13:40.900 --> 13:42.180
When I started doing door-to-door sales, I didn't know

13:42.180 --> 13:42.540
how to do sales.

13:42.540 --> 13:43.540
I knew how to do sales.

13:43.540 --> 13:45.300
I did not know how to do anything technical.

13:45.300 --> 13:46.980
Porter didn't know how to do anything technical.

13:46.980 --> 13:49.660
And he also didn't have any sales experience.

13:49.660 --> 13:51.580
So yeah, I double whammy.

13:51.580 --> 13:53.460
But the cool part is we've actually seen some of our

13:53.460 --> 13:55.220
friends, some of the kids that we went to high school with,

13:55.220 --> 13:58.060
like even in the last week, we've seen not a lot,

13:58.060 --> 14:02.500
but a handful of people that have kind of been watching for

14:02.500 --> 14:05.020
years. And they're finally like, dude,

14:05.020 --> 14:07.700
I should have done this two years ago instead of being out

14:07.700 --> 14:09.700
there in the cold and under the sun,

14:09.700 --> 14:11.100
actually doing manual labor,

14:11.100 --> 14:12.860
which there's a hundred percent nothing wrong with that

14:12.860 --> 14:14.860
actually feels really good to do manual labor.

14:14.860 --> 14:19.260
But this allows you to do, to travel, to be wherever,

14:19.260 --> 14:19.980
to be farming.

14:19.980 --> 14:20.980
I like to travel.

14:20.980 --> 14:23.140
I'm in Africa a lot and you can do this from anywhere.

14:23.140 --> 14:24.820
So Porter, I'm going to show a couple more examples,

14:24.820 --> 14:28.580
but you can hop off and go take care of the truck that's

14:28.580 --> 14:29.740
waiting on you, bro.

14:29.740 --> 14:30.580
Okay. Appreciate it.

14:30.580 --> 14:31.420
See ya.

14:32.380 --> 14:34.620
So guys, I'm just going to show you a couple more examples of

14:34.620 --> 14:36.220
some sites that I've done this with.

14:36.220 --> 14:37.780
And then I'm going to hop off.

14:37.780 --> 14:38.620
That's it.

14:38.620 --> 14:40.060
So here's another example.

14:40.140 --> 14:42.580
If you type in, I'll give you one more St. George one.

14:42.580 --> 14:45.180
If you type in St. George epoxy.

14:45.180 --> 14:47.140
So, you know, when you go into your garage and you have like

14:47.140 --> 14:49.660
an epoxy floor where, I mean,

14:49.660 --> 14:51.180
I didn't even really know what this was growing up,

14:51.180 --> 14:52.140
but then you moved to St. George.

14:52.140 --> 14:52.980
I moved to St. George.

14:52.980 --> 14:53.900
A lot of people had it.

14:53.900 --> 14:55.740
So I'll show you the images here.

14:55.740 --> 14:58.100
So this is like an epoxy garage floor right here.

14:58.100 --> 14:59.900
It makes the garage super nice, super clean,

14:59.900 --> 15:01.180
super easy to clean up.

15:01.180 --> 15:02.900
So if you type in St. George epoxy,

15:02.900 --> 15:04.740
you're going to see me right here at the very top.

15:04.740 --> 15:06.340
Again, these are sponsored ads.

15:06.340 --> 15:07.500
So this means they're paying for this.

15:07.500 --> 15:09.740
So I'm actually the number one person here.

15:11.540 --> 15:14.420
This is my website, stgeorgeopoxy.com.

15:14.420 --> 15:15.260
This is my phone number.

15:15.260 --> 15:16.940
If you call this phone number, I get paid.

15:16.940 --> 15:18.460
Okay. And when I say I get paid,

15:18.460 --> 15:21.340
what I mean by that is my business owners I work with,

15:21.340 --> 15:23.980
they pay me a certain amount every single month

15:23.980 --> 15:25.540
for all the phone calls.

15:25.540 --> 15:27.900
You can do different structures where you can have it set up

15:27.900 --> 15:29.580
where every time the phone rings,

15:29.580 --> 15:30.900
they pay you a certain amount.

15:30.900 --> 15:31.940
I don't like to do it that way

15:31.940 --> 15:33.900
because it's a lot of tracking

15:33.900 --> 15:35.140
and there's a lot of back and forth.

15:35.140 --> 15:36.860
I like to just do a flat fee, make it easy.

15:36.900 --> 15:38.140
I'm the business owner, make it easy on me.

15:38.140 --> 15:40.380
But just for the sake of teaching you guys

15:40.380 --> 15:42.980
and showing you guys what the heck it is I do,

15:42.980 --> 15:44.820
if this phone rings, that's how I get paid.

15:44.820 --> 15:47.060
Okay. So let me show you how much money I've made

15:47.060 --> 15:49.140
from this website right here.

15:49.140 --> 15:51.180
Let me see if I can pull up my screenshot.

15:52.340 --> 15:53.620
Let's see here.

15:54.580 --> 15:55.420
Hang tight.

15:55.420 --> 15:57.300
I think it might be this one.

15:58.420 --> 15:59.260
There it is.

15:59.260 --> 16:00.100
Okay.

16:00.940 --> 16:02.460
Nope. That's another one I'm going to show you.

16:02.460 --> 16:03.540
Let me go to this one.

16:05.060 --> 16:06.460
Okay. So this one right here,

16:07.060 --> 16:09.580
once again, guys, see if you can see this.

16:09.580 --> 16:10.660
I don't know if you can see me.

16:10.660 --> 16:12.140
I can't see myself, hold on.

16:13.060 --> 16:14.820
I'm not sharing my screen anymore.

16:17.020 --> 16:17.860
Sorry, guys.

16:17.860 --> 16:18.780
I didn't even show you that last one.

16:18.780 --> 16:21.180
This is the website I was showing you guys, sorry.

16:22.380 --> 16:24.740
If you type in St. George Epoxy on Google,

16:24.740 --> 16:26.180
you're going to go, you're going to see my website

16:26.180 --> 16:28.020
here at the top, stgeorgeepoxy.com.

16:28.020 --> 16:30.060
You can see it's super simple.

16:30.060 --> 16:30.900
That's it.

16:30.900 --> 16:32.900
If you call this phone number right here, I get paid.

16:32.900 --> 16:33.740
That's what I was trying to say.

16:33.740 --> 16:34.780
So I thought I was sharing my screen

16:34.780 --> 16:35.620
when I was showing you this.

16:36.460 --> 16:37.620
That's another one of my websites.

16:37.620 --> 16:40.340
Here's how much I've made from that website.

16:40.340 --> 16:42.740
So you can see right here, St. George Epoxy leads.

16:44.380 --> 16:45.260
Let's see.

16:45.260 --> 16:46.100
You can see right here.

16:46.100 --> 16:47.260
It doesn't really show the date,

16:47.260 --> 16:49.300
but I just screenshot this right before I came on.

16:49.300 --> 16:51.100
You can see right here, it shows all the way till February.

16:51.100 --> 16:52.540
I don't see anywhere that it shows the actual date.

16:52.540 --> 16:54.140
This one's a little bit lower.

16:54.140 --> 16:56.660
I make $652.23.

16:56.660 --> 17:00.060
Why? Because the jobs aren't worth as much money.

17:00.060 --> 17:01.660
And so I don't get paid as much.

17:01.660 --> 17:02.700
So it's not my favorite niche.

17:02.700 --> 17:05.140
I'd rather go into concrete, but I do have this one.

17:05.660 --> 17:08.300
This guy has been paying me since June of 2020,

17:08.300 --> 17:11.740
and I've made $36,350.

17:11.740 --> 17:13.820
I get paid 150 bucks a week.

17:13.820 --> 17:15.980
Again, 150 bucks isn't gonna make you rich,

17:15.980 --> 17:18.420
but you do that 100 times,

17:18.420 --> 17:21.620
and you're gonna have some nice money coming in.

17:21.620 --> 17:23.620
One thing that's cool about this deal that I did,

17:23.620 --> 17:28.500
I actually, including on top of the money that they paid me,

17:28.500 --> 17:31.540
we actually worked out a deal where this guy did my garage,

17:31.540 --> 17:35.740
and I actually got my garage completely blacked out,

17:35.740 --> 17:37.980
and it looks really, really cool.

17:37.980 --> 17:39.580
So he did that at cost.

17:39.580 --> 17:40.420
I paid for the material.

17:40.420 --> 17:42.420
He actually did the labor.

17:42.420 --> 17:44.140
Okay, let me show you one more website,

17:44.140 --> 17:45.780
and then I'll hop off here.

17:45.780 --> 17:46.660
There's one more deal.

17:46.660 --> 17:49.180
This is another one I did a couple years ago.

17:49.180 --> 17:50.020
Let's see.

17:50.020 --> 17:51.780
Type in Bentonville Concrete.

17:51.780 --> 17:53.660
You're gonna see me here at the top.

17:53.660 --> 17:55.180
You're also gonna see me here.

17:56.100 --> 18:00.820
You're gonna see me that I'm ranked a couple times

18:00.860 --> 18:02.260
on page one, depending on the search term,

18:02.260 --> 18:03.340
but I'm right here at the top.

18:03.340 --> 18:05.020
You click on this.

18:05.020 --> 18:06.980
Another one of my little dinky websites.

18:06.980 --> 18:08.180
Guys, these are not special.

18:08.180 --> 18:09.260
I don't know how to code.

18:09.260 --> 18:10.380
I don't know how to use WordPress.

18:10.380 --> 18:12.340
This is literally built on weebly.com.

18:14.020 --> 18:15.540
This website right here, as soon as you call this,

18:15.540 --> 18:17.020
it goes to my business owner.

18:17.020 --> 18:18.420
It tracks it for me,

18:18.420 --> 18:20.220
and then I send him an invoice every month

18:20.220 --> 18:21.100
and run his credit card.

18:21.100 --> 18:21.980
That's it, okay?

18:21.980 --> 18:24.540
This one, this specific website,

18:24.540 --> 18:28.660
I have made, let me show you here.

18:29.660 --> 18:30.620
Right here.

18:30.620 --> 18:34.340
I have made $52,725.

18:34.340 --> 18:36.060
Now, you see this pass due.

18:36.060 --> 18:38.980
This just means we ran this person's card today,

18:38.980 --> 18:40.300
and it didn't go through.

18:40.300 --> 18:45.060
Maybe he's over the limit or changed cards or whatever,

18:45.060 --> 18:47.740
but what will happen is in two, three days,

18:47.740 --> 18:49.940
we'll hit the card again and it'll run.

18:49.940 --> 18:53.420
So you can see right here, I get paid $978.34

18:53.420 --> 18:54.580
every single month.

18:54.580 --> 18:56.460
It's 225 bucks a week.

18:56.820 --> 18:59.100
I've been working with him since June of 2020.

18:59.100 --> 19:01.700
Ironically, I've actually been working with him longer.

19:01.700 --> 19:04.180
I think I was even working with him the year before,

19:04.180 --> 19:05.260
or six months before that,

19:05.260 --> 19:08.580
but we were running it under a different Stripe account.

19:08.580 --> 19:10.580
But over that course of time,

19:10.580 --> 19:13.900
I've made $52,725.

19:13.900 --> 19:15.860
You can see right here, we started in this account

19:15.860 --> 19:16.820
on June 4th.

19:18.100 --> 19:23.100
$52,725 from this, okay?

19:23.820 --> 19:24.860
This is not fancy.

19:24.860 --> 19:26.180
This is not hard to build.

19:26.820 --> 19:31.820
This website took me probably a week to build,

19:31.820 --> 19:32.820
weeks worth of hours,

19:32.820 --> 19:36.060
so probably 40 to 50 hours worth of time I put into this,

19:36.060 --> 19:37.660
and it's paid me $52,000.

19:37.660 --> 19:39.060
Now, granted, I had to go get the client,

19:39.060 --> 19:40.260
I had to put the deal together.

19:40.260 --> 19:43.780
I do keep the relationship with the client,

19:43.780 --> 19:46.260
but this is, I mean, consider if you knew

19:46.260 --> 19:48.700
you could go spend 50 hours and build something

19:48.700 --> 19:51.940
that was gonna make you $52,000 over the next four years,

19:51.940 --> 19:54.380
wouldn't you do that 100 times?

19:54.380 --> 19:55.660
That's what I've been doing

19:55.660 --> 19:57.380
for the past three, four, five years,

19:57.380 --> 19:58.780
and I've just been stacking these sites,

19:58.780 --> 19:59.860
stacking these sites.

19:59.860 --> 20:04.860
150 bucks a week here, 350 here, 500 there, 100 here,

20:06.180 --> 20:08.020
and these things just continually add up

20:08.020 --> 20:11.580
until you start making quite a bit of money, okay?

20:11.580 --> 20:13.380
So last thing I wanna show you guys really quick,

20:13.380 --> 20:16.220
just for fun, I'll show you a little sample list

20:16.220 --> 20:17.260
of some of my clients here.

20:17.260 --> 20:18.660
I'm not gonna show you their names, obviously,

20:18.660 --> 20:22.900
but I took this screenshot and just blurred out the names.

20:23.860 --> 20:25.620
Just to show you, this is my Stripe account,

20:25.620 --> 20:28.700
did this today, right here, date as of February 18th,

20:28.700 --> 20:31.220
so I guess that's as of yesterday, maybe.

20:31.220 --> 20:33.180
But anyway, you can see right here,

20:33.180 --> 20:35.380
here's my list of clients I'm obviously not gonna show you,

20:35.380 --> 20:39.700
but I've got somebody that's paid me over 132,000.

20:40.700 --> 20:45.700
This one's paid me 64, 57, 54, 52, 47, 46, 36, 35,

20:46.140 --> 20:48.740
33, 32, 29, 29.

20:48.740 --> 20:51.540
This is not all my clients, this is one page of my clients.

20:51.540 --> 20:52.860
You can see right here, these things stack up,

20:52.860 --> 20:56.380
24, 26, 27, 28, all the way up to 132.

20:56.380 --> 20:58.340
And yes, sometimes we have clients

20:58.340 --> 20:59.700
that you start working with,

20:59.700 --> 21:02.900
and then after three to six months, it doesn't work out.

21:02.900 --> 21:05.340
And you go and you part ways and then you take your website.

21:05.340 --> 21:06.340
But here's the beautiful thing, guys,

21:06.340 --> 21:08.660
is when does it work out with the client, right?

21:08.660 --> 21:10.500
So let's say that this specific client

21:10.500 --> 21:11.860
that I'm dealing with here,

21:11.860 --> 21:13.100
let's say this guy calls me and he's like,

21:13.100 --> 21:14.540
hey, I don't wanna buy these leads anymore,

21:14.540 --> 21:16.460
I'm doing something else, I don't have any money,

21:16.460 --> 21:17.940
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

21:17.940 --> 21:21.260
Okay, it's not a big deal because I'm just gonna take

21:21.260 --> 21:24.380
this website, I'm gonna go to my software,

21:24.380 --> 21:27.500
which is, we use this thing called rankandrentengine.com,

21:27.500 --> 21:29.260
and I'm gonna change the phone number

21:29.260 --> 21:31.140
so that when people call this phone number,

21:31.140 --> 21:32.860
it goes to my new business owner.

21:32.860 --> 21:35.620
I'll change it so he's paying me instead of the old guy.

21:35.620 --> 21:39.460
No damage done, it's just like owning properties, right?

21:39.460 --> 21:41.740
If you own a house, you put a tenant in it,

21:41.740 --> 21:42.700
they pay you every month.

21:42.700 --> 21:44.420
If you have to evict that tenant, guess what?

21:44.420 --> 21:46.260
You put somebody else in, they pay you.

21:46.260 --> 21:49.340
That's it, that's the whole game.

21:50.180 --> 21:54.100
Think about this like building houses all over the internet,

21:54.100 --> 21:55.380
but instead of houses, they're websites.

21:55.380 --> 21:58.540
You're building these miniature passive income streams

21:58.540 --> 21:59.580
all over the internet.

21:59.580 --> 22:02.300
The way that I look at it is I have, I don't know,

22:02.300 --> 22:04.700
35 to 50 of these websites, I don't know the exact number

22:04.700 --> 22:06.660
that are rented out versus how many we have,

22:06.660 --> 22:09.700
but every single day, while we're talking right now,

22:09.700 --> 22:11.860
these websites are out there collecting phone calls.

22:11.860 --> 22:13.340
When I'm sleeping, when I'm golfing,

22:13.340 --> 22:15.500
when I'm traveling to Africa,

22:15.500 --> 22:17.180
when I'm doing my team meeting,

22:17.180 --> 22:19.260
which I'm about to do here in one minute,

22:20.180 --> 22:21.020
I'm making money from these websites.

22:21.020 --> 22:23.380
It's like, I always think about it like this show,

22:23.380 --> 22:26.020
Despicable Me, and Gru has the minions, right?

22:26.020 --> 22:27.900
And they're literally just working,

22:27.900 --> 22:29.740
and they're just doing stuff for them.

22:29.740 --> 22:31.620
I don't think, if I remember the show right,

22:31.620 --> 22:32.460
they have to eat.

22:32.460 --> 22:34.460
The one thing with these minions is they do have

22:34.460 --> 22:35.860
like personalities and feelings.

22:35.860 --> 22:38.540
These don't have feelings, these don't have personalities,

22:38.540 --> 22:41.060
these don't need time off, these don't need vacations,

22:41.060 --> 22:43.820
these don't need compliments, and you tell them

22:43.820 --> 22:46.740
that they're doing a good job, they just go to work for you.

22:46.740 --> 22:50.380
You build them, you rank them, you set them free,

22:50.380 --> 22:51.980
and they go and they collect dollars for you

22:51.980 --> 22:54.580
all over the internet while you do what you love to do.

22:54.580 --> 22:58.500
So, anyway, for anyone that might have been curious,

22:58.500 --> 22:59.500
maybe you weren't curious at all,

22:59.500 --> 23:02.100
maybe you just think it's annoying that I keep posting this,

23:02.100 --> 23:04.340
I'm sorry, you can unfollow me.

23:04.340 --> 23:06.180
I use these social medias for business,

23:06.180 --> 23:07.700
social media channels for business,

23:07.700 --> 23:10.220
but for those of you that are curious, interested,

23:10.220 --> 23:12.220
whatever, this is how it works.

23:12.220 --> 23:14.100
You build these sites, you rank them,

23:14.100 --> 23:15.500
you rent them out to local business owners,

23:15.500 --> 23:17.780
you get paid, you do it again, you do it again,

23:17.780 --> 23:18.620
you do it again.

23:18.620 --> 23:20.220
You spend your life doing what you love to do

23:20.220 --> 23:21.780
instead of working for somebody else, okay?

23:21.780 --> 23:22.620
That's the whole game.

23:22.620 --> 23:25.020
So, that said, the only thing I'll do really quick,

23:25.020 --> 23:27.260
I have a couple of, if you guys are interested,

23:27.260 --> 23:28.500
I have a free training,

23:30.340 --> 23:32.140
because people are like, how do you learn more,

23:32.140 --> 23:33.620
rentsimplesites.com.

23:35.900 --> 23:36.860
Give me one second.

23:40.060 --> 23:42.580
Rentsimplesites.com, that's a free training.

23:46.500 --> 23:49.260
And then we also have a community,

23:49.260 --> 23:53.260
which is, if you go to rankandretire.com.

23:55.780 --> 23:58.140
Again, no pressure, these are just some resources.

23:58.140 --> 23:59.740
And then I'm actually gonna do this.

23:59.740 --> 24:02.340
I talked to Porter, I have a deal with him,

24:02.340 --> 24:03.820
anybody that he does this with,

24:03.820 --> 24:05.500
I actually make sure he's taken care of,

24:05.500 --> 24:07.940
but I'm gonna drop Porter's number.

24:09.700 --> 24:11.540
If you guys have any questions,

24:11.540 --> 24:13.900
you can literally text Porter, this is his own cell phone,

24:13.900 --> 24:18.180
you can text Porter, and he will text you back,

24:18.180 --> 24:19.180
or hop on a call with you,

24:19.180 --> 24:20.820
and just kinda walk you through it.

24:20.820 --> 24:23.700
So, anyway, if you guys are curious, there you go.

24:23.700 --> 24:25.500
If not, no big deal, thanks for being on the live.

24:25.500 --> 24:27.260
I'm gonna jump onto a team meeting.

24:27.260 --> 24:28.940
Happy February, stay warm,

24:28.940 --> 24:30.740
see you guys on the next one, I'm out.
