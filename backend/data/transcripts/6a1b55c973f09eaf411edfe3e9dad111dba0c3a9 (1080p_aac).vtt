00:00.000 --> 00:16.560
I want to tell you guys and share with you guys what I consider to be my secret weapon

00:16.560 --> 00:17.960
and it should be yours as well.

00:17.960 --> 00:21.960
Okay, this is called the pullback and the reason I'm putting this video right here,

00:21.960 --> 00:25.720
we just got done talking about the four steps to the perfect prospecting script.

00:25.720 --> 00:29.620
I want to tell you about the pullback because this is going to be an opportunity where you're

00:29.620 --> 00:32.100
probably first going to need to use this.

00:32.100 --> 00:35.660
Okay, I'm going to tell you a couple of the situations in which you would use it.

00:35.660 --> 00:39.020
I'm going to tell you how to properly use it and I'm going to tell you how often you

00:39.020 --> 00:43.420
should use it so you don't overuse it, okay, and if you actually can overuse it.

00:43.420 --> 00:50.340
So first of all, the pullback, what the pullback is, is it's you basically making a statement

00:50.340 --> 00:53.460
that lets them know, hey, it puts them in their place.

00:53.460 --> 00:57.940
It checks them and lets them know, hey, you need this more than I need this, okay?

00:57.940 --> 00:58.940
That's the pullback.

00:59.260 --> 01:00.260
Pulling away.

01:00.260 --> 01:04.580
And you know, for the first couple steps, you know, one, two, three, who I am, what

01:04.580 --> 01:08.780
I'm doing, what's the deal, transition, it's been go, I'm coming at them, I'm coming at

01:08.780 --> 01:12.740
them, I'm coming at them, I'm coming at them and a lot of times you're going to need at

01:12.740 --> 01:16.940
this point to do a pullback and what this is going to do is it's going to put you back

01:16.940 --> 01:19.960
in control because you need people coming to you.

01:19.960 --> 01:25.420
You need to be in control of the deal and so the pullback is something that you can

01:25.420 --> 01:29.700
use any time, there's a couple different places that you can use this but I will say

01:29.700 --> 01:31.300
this, couple rules of thumb with the pullback.

01:31.300 --> 01:35.900
First of all, you could use this as many times as you need and you're not going to ruin the

01:35.900 --> 01:36.900
deal.

01:36.900 --> 01:37.900
You are not going to ruin the deal.

01:37.900 --> 01:42.620
As long as you're talking to the right people and you're not being salesy and you're doing

01:42.620 --> 01:47.860
the stuff right and you're giving leads in advance, you will not lose a deal by doing

01:47.860 --> 01:48.860
too many pullbacks.

01:48.860 --> 01:49.860
I promise you.

01:49.860 --> 01:50.860
That's the cool part.

01:50.860 --> 01:53.300
You don't have to worry about overusing the pullback, okay?

01:53.300 --> 01:55.020
Here's a couple places I like to use it.

01:55.020 --> 01:59.140
This is a really good point I like to use it at because sometimes, and I've seen this

01:59.140 --> 02:02.980
and you guys have probably seen this in the group, is you get through, you do your pitch

02:02.980 --> 02:05.980
and the business owner, they're all yeses, baby.

02:05.980 --> 02:06.980
Yeah, sounds good.

02:06.980 --> 02:07.980
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:07.980 --> 02:08.980
Okay, cool.

02:08.980 --> 02:09.980
Sounds good.

02:09.980 --> 02:10.980
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:10.980 --> 02:11.980
It's all yes.

02:11.980 --> 02:12.980
No questions.

02:12.980 --> 02:13.980
No objections.

02:13.980 --> 02:14.980
No nothing.

02:14.980 --> 02:15.980
You're like, dude, this is a golden ticket.

02:15.980 --> 02:16.980
This guy is sold.

02:16.980 --> 02:17.980
That's what you're thinking in your head.

02:17.980 --> 02:18.980
Let me tell you what.

02:18.980 --> 02:23.980
Truth is, this guy or this lady is too scared to tell you no and so it's coming out as yeah,

02:23.980 --> 02:25.460
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:25.460 --> 02:26.460
Really?

02:26.460 --> 02:28.260
They couldn't be further from a yeah.

02:28.260 --> 02:32.880
So if you start getting the yes guy, the yes lady, I want you to use a pullback.

02:32.880 --> 02:34.700
Something like this, okay?

02:34.700 --> 02:36.700
You get to the end and everything's a yes.

02:36.700 --> 02:39.020
Hey, I'm gonna send you a couple free leads.

02:39.020 --> 02:40.020
We're gonna talk in a couple days.

02:40.020 --> 02:41.020
How's that sound?

02:41.020 --> 02:42.020
Cool.

02:42.020 --> 02:43.020
Sounds good.

02:43.020 --> 02:44.020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:44.020 --> 02:45.020
Sounds good.

02:45.020 --> 02:46.020
And they're rushing you and it's just yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

02:46.020 --> 02:47.020
And you're like, this sounds too good to be true.

02:47.020 --> 02:48.020
It is.

02:48.020 --> 02:49.020
Okay?

02:49.020 --> 02:50.020
Here's what you're gonna do.

02:50.020 --> 02:51.020
You're gonna stop them and say, hey, look, that sounds good.

02:51.020 --> 02:52.980
I just want to double check.

02:52.980 --> 02:57.340
First of all, don't take this wrong, but Jack, shoot me straight here, man.

02:57.340 --> 03:00.060
I'm a grown ass man.

03:00.060 --> 03:04.420
Are you interested in growing your business or are you just too scared to tell me no?

03:04.420 --> 03:09.140
And I know, guys, I know that sounds bold, but I don't got time to waste these people,

03:09.140 --> 03:10.140
okay?

03:10.140 --> 03:14.500
So I'm literally gonna say, hey, Jack, real quick, before I hang up, I just don't want

03:14.500 --> 03:15.500
to waste your time.

03:15.500 --> 03:16.500
I don't want to waste my time.

03:16.500 --> 03:19.080
I'm a grown ass man here, so shoot me straight.

03:19.080 --> 03:22.820
Are you interested in growing your company or you just don't want to tell me no?

03:23.660 --> 03:24.860
Because these are jobs that are coming in.

03:24.860 --> 03:27.700
I only work with one company per area.

03:27.700 --> 03:31.420
So if this isn't something like you don't want to grow and whatever, that's cool.

03:31.420 --> 03:32.420
Just let me know now.

03:32.420 --> 03:34.660
But just don't waste my time, okay?

03:34.660 --> 03:38.380
And I know you're like, oh my gosh, you're gonna ruin the deal.

03:38.380 --> 03:39.380
Nope.

03:39.380 --> 03:41.260
Just the opposite, okay?

03:41.260 --> 03:42.260
Just the opposite.

03:42.260 --> 03:44.820
What you're gonna do is you're gonna wake their ass up.

03:44.820 --> 03:48.340
And if they've been sitting there sleeping going, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, if they actually

03:48.340 --> 03:50.220
are interested, you know what they're gonna do?

03:50.220 --> 03:51.620
They're gonna all of a sudden come after you.

03:51.620 --> 03:53.580
They're gonna go, oh, no, no, no, no, man, listen.

03:53.580 --> 03:54.580
It's funny.

03:54.580 --> 03:56.620
He's like, sorry, I'm driving.

03:56.620 --> 03:58.620
And I kind of sound distracted, but I'm really interested.

03:58.620 --> 04:03.340
Me and my partner or I was actually just talking to my wife or I was just talking to my husband

04:03.340 --> 04:06.260
and I was just saying how much I'm tired, sick and tired of home.

04:06.260 --> 04:08.500
They will start to sell you.

04:08.500 --> 04:12.580
And the other cool part is if they're not following you and they really are the yes,

04:12.580 --> 04:15.860
yes, yes, yes, yes, but they just don't want to tell you no, you know what they're gonna

04:15.860 --> 04:16.860
say?

04:16.860 --> 04:20.380
They're gonna say, yeah, man, like I don't want to, like I really don't want to waste

04:20.380 --> 04:21.380
your time.

04:22.140 --> 04:24.260
And if you have somebody else, like we're good.

04:24.260 --> 04:25.260
We're good.

04:25.260 --> 04:26.260
Okay.

04:26.260 --> 04:30.500
And you're just gonna give them an opportunity to just walk away and you're gonna give them

04:30.500 --> 04:31.500
an out.

04:31.500 --> 04:35.740
Because what happens a lot of time with these yes, yes, yes, is you hang up the phone.

04:35.740 --> 04:36.740
You're jacked.

04:36.740 --> 04:37.740
You post to the group.

04:37.740 --> 04:39.900
I just got somebody hooked, baby.

04:39.900 --> 04:40.900
Let's go.

04:40.900 --> 04:41.900
Okay.

04:41.900 --> 04:42.900
Guess what happens?

04:42.900 --> 04:43.900
You get the lead.

04:43.900 --> 04:44.900
Get them on the phone.

04:44.900 --> 04:45.900
You get Janet on the phone.

04:45.900 --> 04:47.460
You go to call Jack back.

04:47.460 --> 04:48.460
Jack doesn't answer.

04:48.460 --> 04:50.500
Oh, Jack's on a job.

04:50.620 --> 04:51.620
Hey, Janet.

04:51.620 --> 04:52.620
Jack's gonna be calling you.

04:52.620 --> 04:53.620
No problem.

04:53.620 --> 04:54.620
24 hours later.

04:54.620 --> 04:55.620
Jack's gone.

04:55.620 --> 04:57.300
Jack's ghost mode, baby.

04:57.300 --> 04:58.300
Jack is off.

04:58.300 --> 04:59.860
Jack's phone number's changed.

04:59.860 --> 05:01.940
Like guys, that guy's ghosting you.

05:01.940 --> 05:03.100
You will never hear from them again.

05:03.100 --> 05:05.940
And the problem is they were never following you in the first place.

05:05.940 --> 05:07.260
They were too scared to tell you no.

05:07.260 --> 05:11.360
And yes, I know that sounds funny because we're talking about grown ass men and women

05:11.360 --> 05:12.580
lying to your face.

05:12.580 --> 05:14.940
It happens every single day.

05:14.940 --> 05:21.140
So I love using the pullback at the end of step four, the transition, to just make sure

05:21.140 --> 05:22.140
they are following me.

05:22.140 --> 05:26.380
That's if I, you know, if it sounds too good to be true, use the pullback, okay?

05:26.380 --> 05:31.860
The other end of that is if someone is kind of being short with you, they're kind of acting

05:31.860 --> 05:32.980
too busy.

05:32.980 --> 05:37.500
They're acting like they're doing you a favor, like, yeah, I mean, I'm busy, but like I can

05:37.500 --> 05:40.980
take some jobs if you want to send them to me.

05:40.980 --> 05:43.020
In my head, I'm like, look, bro, you don't understand.

05:43.340 --> 05:47.100
I'm not like, I got too much going on to be doing favors, right?

05:47.100 --> 05:50.980
Like I'm happy to send you some to earn your business, to gain your trust, but I'm not

05:50.980 --> 05:53.660
just like, you don't need to do me a favor, okay?

05:53.660 --> 05:57.700
And I'll use a pullback then and I'll go, hey, just real quick, like, just, I want you

05:57.700 --> 05:59.880
to know I only work with one company.

05:59.880 --> 06:06.180
So if this is going to be a burden for you to take on more work, by like, make no mistake,

06:06.180 --> 06:08.140
I don't need you to take on this work.

06:08.140 --> 06:11.620
I'm asking you if you're hungry to go, are you hungry to go?

06:11.620 --> 06:15.060
And I know that's a little aggressive and do I say it that bold every time?

06:15.060 --> 06:16.060
No, sometimes do I?

06:16.060 --> 06:19.020
Yes, because I'm just feeling it and I'm just not in the mood.

06:19.020 --> 06:20.700
You guys can say this in your own way.

06:20.700 --> 06:25.220
You don't need to be that bold, but you need to convey the fact that, hey, you need to

06:25.220 --> 06:29.580
let them know that they need you more than you need them.

06:29.580 --> 06:33.960
And I need you guys to mentally realize you don't need them.

06:33.960 --> 06:39.620
There are 20, there are at least five to 20 to 50 different options in each city, in each

06:39.620 --> 06:42.300
service that you can work with.

06:42.300 --> 06:43.300
Guess what?

06:43.300 --> 06:44.380
There's only one of you.

06:44.380 --> 06:45.780
And we forget this.

06:45.780 --> 06:49.740
We think that all of a sudden we got one option, we got one option that's the person and if

06:49.740 --> 06:50.740
they don't do it, we're screwed.

06:50.740 --> 06:52.060
No, that's not the truth.

06:52.060 --> 06:56.260
The truth is you're the only person and you're the one that has what they need and you know

06:56.260 --> 06:58.300
that because they're already paying for ads.

06:58.300 --> 07:03.140
So get that in your damn mind and start using pullbacks and be bold.

07:03.140 --> 07:05.900
And I do want to mention this and I'll talk about this, I'll talk about pullbacks later

07:05.900 --> 07:07.620
in future videos.

07:07.620 --> 07:12.700
You're also going to be able to use a pullback anytime during the process where the deal

07:12.700 --> 07:17.620
sounds shaky, where the customer's not answering the phone, where the customer is just wasting

07:17.620 --> 07:21.420
your time or you feel like they're wasting your time, use the pullback.

07:21.420 --> 07:25.140
It is literally the secret weapon and I know it's very, very scary, especially the first

07:25.140 --> 07:28.700
time you're like, oh my gosh, I just got through this really scary pitch and they said yes

07:28.700 --> 07:32.260
and now I'm going to be that bold to just throw it all away.

07:32.260 --> 07:34.260
Nope, you're not throwing it away.

07:34.260 --> 07:38.980
You are just sifting out the crappy from the people that are actually serious, you're sifting

07:38.980 --> 07:43.180
out the people who are not serious from the ones that are ready to rock and roll.

07:43.180 --> 07:48.140
The pullback is a freaking secret weapon, master it, get used to it, I'll try and drop

07:48.140 --> 07:55.300
some swipes but really the principle is you just need to convey that they need you more

07:55.300 --> 07:56.500
than you need them.
