WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:12.160
All right, hey guys, let's see here.

00:12.160 --> 00:16.000
I think we're live, all right, all right.

00:16.000 --> 00:26.120
Let's see, this lets me go to here, awesome, okay, all right, cool, hey guys, let me put

00:26.120 --> 00:33.120
the link for the zoom here, and then I got to hop on my phone real quick and do the everyone,

00:33.120 --> 00:43.640
so just give me a second, there's the link for the zoom, yeah, let me go here, give me

00:43.640 --> 01:11.440
a second, yeah, there we are, yeah, okay, I think we are, yeah, all right, all right,

01:12.000 --> 01:29.760
I think we are, we're there, all right, cool, yeah, okay, cool, all right, what's up guys,

01:29.840 --> 01:45.040
how's it going, hope everyone's doing well, yes, let me make sure, sorry, give me a second,

01:51.920 --> 01:53.760
okay, we're good, all right, awesome,

01:59.760 --> 02:11.920
let's see, okay, cool, all right, zoom is open, if you guys want to hop in,

02:12.640 --> 02:24.800
we can get over and get some ad questions taken care of, and we'll go from there,

02:24.800 --> 02:41.360
all right, okay, we got a few people here, are you guys seeing the, for the few people

02:41.360 --> 02:46.720
that are watching, are you seeing the links, sometimes the Facebook interface and the zoom

02:46.720 --> 02:51.360
are really delayed, so I just want to make sure, I see them on my phone, but I'm not necessarily

02:51.360 --> 02:55.680
seeing it on the desktop version, someone can, I think there's only a few people watching,

02:55.680 --> 02:59.600
if you guys can just let me know, that'd be awesome, thank you very much, appreciate that,

03:04.240 --> 03:12.800
all right, well, while we're waiting for people, let's go ahead and take a look,

03:12.800 --> 03:17.600
oh, we got someone hopping in, it's like Zach is hopping in, Zach, are you there?

03:18.000 --> 03:22.880
Yeah, I'm here, hey, what's up, man, how you doing? I'm doing pretty good, and you? Good,

03:22.880 --> 03:26.720
oh, not bad, not bad, what can we help you with, do you have any questions for today?

03:27.680 --> 03:32.400
Yeah, I know you guys went over this in like the last few zooms, I think, I don't know if there's,

03:34.960 --> 03:42.880
it's with the ranges in the ads and the keyword list, I'm still getting ranges, so, I'm in the

03:42.880 --> 03:51.280
US, but I've made an MCC account, and I linked my sub account to it, and on that sub account,

03:51.280 --> 04:01.040
I've ran an ad in the past, and I've spent something like $200 on it, so, yeah, I'm just

04:01.040 --> 04:07.280
wondering how to get that, to not show ranges anymore. Okay, is the ad active right now?

04:07.760 --> 04:14.080
It was active in November, I paused it sometime in December, but I resumed it maybe last week,

04:14.080 --> 04:20.080
a week or two ago. Okay, and when you're under, when you're on Keyword Planner, are you under

04:20.080 --> 04:26.320
that account, under that ad account? Yes. Okay, and it's still not showing the ranges for you,

04:26.320 --> 04:32.800
huh? Yeah, like it is showing the ranges, but like not specifically, you know. Okay, would you like

04:32.800 --> 04:37.840
would you be able to share your screen so I can take a look? Yeah, I believe so. I'm kind of getting

04:37.840 --> 04:43.840
the impression that so many more of you guys are having, what group did you come, did you come from

04:43.840 --> 04:49.120
Shib's group, or did you find this group? Yeah, I did. Okay, it seems like everyone from Shib's

04:49.120 --> 04:58.640
group is having this issue, so it's very odd, so I'm trying to figure it out as well, but I think

04:59.040 --> 05:03.680
I'm trying to figure it out as well, but I think some of it is,

05:06.720 --> 05:14.960
so there's been, I just saw the other day that there's a new, there's some changes in the

05:16.160 --> 05:22.320
interface on Google that's like not showing clicks and impressions as much. I don't think

05:22.320 --> 05:27.120
they're, I don't think it's just a glitch as well, so there's some stuff happening. My point is like

05:27.200 --> 05:32.800
there's stuff happening on the Google ad interface right now, and we're not like fully aware of what

05:32.800 --> 05:39.120
they're trying to do yet. We're all trying to like, what are you guys doing? So, I don't know. So,

05:39.120 --> 05:44.080
okay, yeah, let's try to go to, let's open up Keyword Planner. Let's see what happens here.

05:44.080 --> 05:54.400
Okay. Yeah, so this is my sub account I have here. Click it.

05:57.120 --> 06:06.400
Concrete.

06:06.480 --> 06:17.680
Okay.

06:22.480 --> 06:24.240
Yeah, this is what I've still been getting.

06:28.400 --> 06:33.600
Okay. All right, and this is, did I make seen this right? Ann Arbor,

06:33.600 --> 06:42.160
Michigan for the term concrete. All right. Let me, give me, give me a second. Let me,

06:42.160 --> 06:51.680
let me pull up mine and let me see. Let me see what I'm getting. Again, I think this is,

06:51.680 --> 06:59.200
I don't know if this is like a glitch in the system. I don't know if it's Google trying to

06:59.840 --> 07:09.280
like mess with, you know how like they have like the $1,000 spending limit now, and I don't know

07:09.280 --> 07:15.200
if they're doing it. I just, I don't know what they're doing lately. There's definitely some

07:16.000 --> 07:22.000
interface and platform stuff going on. All right, let me, I'm going to click one here.

07:22.000 --> 07:22.800
Click one here.

07:24.560 --> 07:27.680
Because I think when I had the ad ring in November, I could view it.

07:28.640 --> 07:40.080
Yeah. Well, I'm going to see right now. If I'm getting Ann Arbor, Michigan, right?

07:40.080 --> 07:47.760
About 538,000 people. Okay. Concrete. Get results. Let's see what I got here.

07:52.000 --> 08:08.480
Getting, not even a spreadsheet showing up. Hang on. Let me hit refresh.

08:08.480 --> 08:22.160
That was really weird. It like loaded, but it didn't load all the way. So let me try to redo it.

08:22.960 --> 08:28.960
Give me a second.

08:39.440 --> 08:49.760
Hmm. Okay. So I'm getting a really weird, can you scroll up on the spreadsheet on your end there?

08:50.880 --> 08:57.760
Or is that the top? That's the top. Okay. Give me a quick second. Let me see what I got going on here.

08:57.760 --> 09:04.240
There's mine.

09:11.840 --> 09:18.240
There it goes.

09:18.720 --> 09:36.800
Yeah, mine's showing, don't leave your platform. And let me, I'm just trying to go back and forth

09:36.800 --> 09:43.920
between my window and yours. So mine's showing the term concrete at 110.

09:44.720 --> 09:55.040
It has no, it just tracks search volume, but there's no CPC data for it.

09:58.480 --> 10:04.560
Even concrete contractors, concrete companies. There's concrete repair. That's the only one that

10:04.640 --> 10:12.160
I have a CPC for. So let's look at this again. That's the same for mine.

10:14.240 --> 10:17.920
That dollar amount. Yeah. But I'm seeing like that's a 20 for me.

10:20.960 --> 10:21.440
Okay.

10:28.400 --> 10:31.440
Okay. Go ahead and scroll up on the spreadsheet.

11:04.560 --> 11:17.920
I'm not sure why you're not seeing the same thing. Okay. So I'm running this on

11:18.800 --> 11:24.720
a really, really old smart campaign that Nick used to have that we're not running ads on.

11:24.720 --> 11:29.520
It's still a active campaign, but it's like, there's nothing running on it at all. So it's

11:29.520 --> 11:34.880
like, there's no, it's an active campaign, but the ads are paused. Does that make sense?

11:35.920 --> 11:41.760
So it has the same green like circle you do. When in the keyword planner, I hit concrete,

11:41.760 --> 11:46.240
I hit Ann Arbor. I'm showing this, right? Yours is not showing that.

11:48.320 --> 11:55.520
Okay. And then here's the spreadsheet. And this looks like the same thing, like 764 words, right?

11:56.080 --> 12:00.720
Yeah. Yeah. And you can very clearly see that I'm getting concrete concrete.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.320
You can see the exact search volume.

12:05.280 --> 12:12.000
So why are you not is the question. And this is in Nick's MCC. And I'm using

12:13.920 --> 12:17.600
one in a whole different state, like system old smart campaign.

12:19.120 --> 12:21.760
So, I mean, there's nothing, that's nothing special about it.

12:22.480 --> 12:27.040
Um, was, was that a campaign that's like already been ran before maybe

12:28.720 --> 12:32.720
this one was, but he, I don't think this campaign has been active for like three years.

12:33.600 --> 12:37.360
Oh yeah. It's still, I mean, there's, it's an active, it's still left,

12:37.360 --> 12:44.480
but there's no active ads running. Yeah. Yeah. I'm not sure if it was something like

12:44.480 --> 12:50.080
it's grandfathered in compared to this is like a brand new one or what I just set up like

12:51.040 --> 12:56.480
four ads for different clients. Um, this last week, brand new ads, no problem using this.

12:58.480 --> 13:07.920
So I'm not sure why, why you guys are having this issue. It's something I haven't figured out why

13:07.920 --> 13:15.360
yet, but it's something with, um, the people from it's like something in their setup. I can't figure

13:15.520 --> 13:22.320
out what it is yet that you guys are getting from, um, in ships group, like how you guys are setting

13:22.320 --> 13:31.440
it up. Um, I'm not sure why yet. Um, again, it could just, it could just be like all of my accounts,

13:31.440 --> 13:38.000
like I've spent well over a thousand dollars, like, um, you know, Nick's like one and a half million.

13:38.000 --> 13:41.600
Uh, I'm, you know, I'm in the several hundred thousand dollar range. Like,

13:42.160 --> 13:47.600
so I don't know if it's just that it could be that and it's like a new platform thing. Um,

13:47.600 --> 13:56.800
have you used, um, Ryan's, uh, let me see if I can get to it. Uh, rare rare. Yeah. Have you used that

13:56.800 --> 14:07.520
yet? I haven't yet. Okay. Yeah. I highly recommend it. Um, so I'm still like in the beginning of

14:07.520 --> 14:14.880
using it, but like, watch, I'm just going to do States. We're going to do

14:17.040 --> 14:23.280
Michigan. We're going to do a few of the videos, uh, yeah. Is that promoting it?

14:24.400 --> 14:31.440
Yeah. It's pretty cool. Um, like it's got a lot of the niches built in.

14:31.440 --> 14:39.040
Okay. Let's see here. Um, keyword planner and then we're going to do, I totally clicked the wrong

14:39.040 --> 14:48.960
one here. Sorry. So let's see what it shows. So this is like, this is kind of where,

14:48.960 --> 14:54.720
like, my brain is at right now with this for you guys. Um, let me, let me share my screen again.

14:55.760 --> 15:03.200
Okay. So, okay. So I just went in, I just did concrete, Michigan, Ann Arbor, right? And it's

15:03.200 --> 15:09.360
like, here's your, that's a good one. Um, and then we're going to, we're going to, we're going to

15:09.840 --> 15:16.000
Okay. So, okay. So I just went in, I just did concrete, Michigan, Ann Arbor,

15:16.560 --> 15:20.400
right? And it's like, here's your, that's exactly what I saw on keyword planner.

15:21.280 --> 15:27.280
Um, it doesn't give a CPC, but you see this, how there's like, this is your, are you familiar with

15:27.280 --> 15:34.720
like keyword difficulty, a KD rating? Um, not a whole lot. Okay. It's just, it's just a,

15:34.720 --> 15:40.400
some of the platforms use it as a metric to try to tell you like very easy, medium,

15:40.400 --> 15:46.720
or super difficult keyword to rank for. Um, and when you see this PPC thing here with a number,

15:46.720 --> 15:51.680
it's very similar to that. It's basically, they're just doing a quick, like it's, it's right here.

15:51.680 --> 15:57.280
It's low, medium, or like really high competition, right? So this tells me that there might be some

15:57.280 --> 16:03.600
ads running, but it may not be enough for it to like really pick up the other data that you're

16:03.600 --> 16:12.400
wanting to find. Okay. Um, but then like, you can see, you know, it kind of, I just did one word

16:12.400 --> 16:17.840
and it populates a lot of these other ones, right? So it's like concrete companies, concrete

16:17.840 --> 16:23.600
contracts. So there's search volume here. Um, you know, I only see like, remember we saw the

16:23.600 --> 16:30.400
concrete repair was the only one that we saw that for. Um, so it's definitely something to

16:31.280 --> 16:39.920
see what this is. It's, it's, uh, look at this. Um, yeah, you can see like in the warmer months,

16:39.920 --> 16:44.960
there's more searches than the colder months. Um, and that might be why it's not picking up CPC

16:44.960 --> 16:51.280
right now. That could be why, because it is cold up there. Um, so my, my thing right now for you

16:51.280 --> 16:58.880
guys is like this, this tool allows you to do like track tasks. You could do due diligence on it.

16:59.520 --> 17:05.040
Um, you can, you know, put things in, you can keep track of things in your clients, like leads,

17:05.600 --> 17:11.360
phone numbers, like it's a pretty bitching tool. Um, I haven't messed with the backlink analyzer

17:11.360 --> 17:16.800
yet because that's still new, but, um, I think this is like the path forward for you guys.

17:16.800 --> 17:24.480
Honestly, it just, it just, it seems to simplify things. It's less spreadsheets. It's less manual

17:24.480 --> 17:29.680
stuff. It kind of is like a one-stop shop for what we want to do. And it allows you to go really

17:29.680 --> 17:38.320
fast and at scale. So, um, I'm still trying to figure out how to get my VA on it. Um,

17:40.240 --> 17:46.160
and, and maybe get her off of like using main goals and SIM rush and all that stuff. So I

17:46.160 --> 17:51.920
may have her go full time on rare just to see if it's faster for her to do so.

17:52.720 --> 17:57.360
And when it doesn't get like CPCs that pick up on that, is that like a

17:57.360 --> 17:59.280
keyword you should not be like targeting as well?

18:00.640 --> 18:06.720
Uh, so yes and no. Like if you're looking at Michigan, like you saw in one of those,

18:06.720 --> 18:11.840
like it dropped off to like 10 in the cold months and you can see it pick back up in the warmer

18:11.840 --> 18:19.760
months. So that, that doesn't mean that there's no ads running. It just probably means there's

18:19.760 --> 18:25.760
not a lot of ads running right now. Sometimes when like search volumes really low, it doesn't,

18:25.760 --> 18:30.640
it just doesn't aggregate the data up. It doesn't mean that you shouldn't run an ad on it.

18:32.080 --> 18:38.720
Or if you go like to a warmer city and try to maybe use that term, you might get better results

18:38.720 --> 18:45.360
right now. Like if you go somewhere in Florida right now, um, you may see more, like even a

18:45.360 --> 18:51.520
like-sized city. I mean, that's a, that was like what 538,000 people. Um, that's one of those,

18:51.520 --> 18:57.120
like if you go back way back in the group, you'll see people like I did my research and CPC was this

18:57.120 --> 19:01.280
and three months later it's like this. And it's like, well, yeah, it's warmer. There's more people

19:01.280 --> 19:08.240
on the auction market. Like, so, you know, there's, there's, there are fluctuations in the data.

19:08.240 --> 19:14.480
There's fluctuations in the marketplace, right? But, uh, like right now searching in a cold place

19:14.480 --> 19:19.680
for concrete may not give you the best results because sometimes that data that Google is

19:19.680 --> 19:24.880
giving to you is like within a couple of like, it might only be two or three months of data

19:24.880 --> 19:32.320
and may not be like forever data. Right. So, and you'll see that like, you'll see that in like,

19:32.880 --> 19:38.880
let's say you're, you're running ads at say, like, say you start and it's like 650 click.

19:38.880 --> 19:42.720
And then in the warmer months, it's like double that. And then you'll notice again, in the colder

19:42.720 --> 19:46.960
months, it goes back down. So if you stay in certain niches in certain areas, you'll see kind

19:46.960 --> 19:51.920
of cycles, but it's just the thing where, you know, it's why we, you know, we, that's why we

19:51.920 --> 19:57.040
want to look at our ads and make adjustments and we go through them and we look at things and,

19:57.040 --> 20:02.240
oh, what is, what is my, what is it telling me this bit is versus what is my set limit at? And

20:02.240 --> 20:06.240
sometimes you have to fluctuate with that, uh, depending on the weather, really.

20:07.200 --> 20:09.760
So that makes sense. I appreciate your help.

20:10.320 --> 20:16.400
Yeah, no problem. But yeah, I think I'm not sure why you guys, it's, it seems like, I don't know

20:16.400 --> 20:20.880
if we're getting all of our new students from shifts group, but all of you guys are having the

20:20.880 --> 20:26.560
same problems. I'm not sure if it's like, maybe you set up Google ads or your Google keyword planner

20:26.560 --> 20:31.760
a certain way, and it's not recognizing that ad, but I've had other students where we did that

20:31.840 --> 20:36.080
and it worked fine for them. So it's just not working out for everybody. But I'm also,

20:36.880 --> 20:42.560
I'm not like a hundred percent there, but like I mentioned, I'm seeing stuff on the interface

20:43.520 --> 20:50.640
that is like not showing data the way it normally would. And it's like, you have to like go and like

20:50.640 --> 20:55.600
manually open columns. And so there's something going on with the Google ads platform is what

20:55.600 --> 21:00.000
I'm getting at. So I don't know if they're like silently doing an update. I don't know if they're

21:00.080 --> 21:05.760
doing some backend stuff. And so our user end is not looking correct right now. I don't know if

21:05.760 --> 21:10.880
this is going to be a permanent thing, if it's a temporary thing yet, but I'm kind of, I'm kind of

21:10.880 --> 21:21.040
going towards, because right, like Google, like, okay, Google is the largest advertising agency,

21:21.040 --> 21:26.560
like in the world. Okay. So they want to make money. They've been losing money for years. So

21:26.560 --> 21:33.360
they're doing things to try to make more money, but their biggest, the biggest thing they kind

21:33.360 --> 21:41.920
of like guard against is fraud. Right. And so, so like one of the, like one of the barriers to entry

21:41.920 --> 21:46.080
now is like, you have to spend a thousand dollars in ad spend to be able to like quote unquote,

21:46.080 --> 21:52.240
like run an MCC or be able to set up sub accounts in your MCC. That's something that's about a year

21:52.240 --> 21:59.360
old now. It was like, now, like now everybody faces that, or for like the first five or six

21:59.360 --> 22:05.120
months of that, it was hit and miss. Now it's like, that's just, that's, that's how it is for

22:05.120 --> 22:10.240
everybody on the platform. So my point is like, they change things sometimes, and sometimes

22:10.240 --> 22:18.560
they'll do certain things for certain features to make the barrier enter it harder or higher.

22:18.560 --> 22:27.200
And part of that is like, because if, if I have you run ads for a range, if I'm Google,

22:27.200 --> 22:30.800
and then I wanted to get you on a call with one of my people, my salespeople,

22:30.800 --> 22:35.520
who I call a Google expert, they're just trying to, they're going to want to set up your ad for you

22:35.520 --> 22:39.360
and run it for you. They're just going to spend all your money and they don't really care that you

22:39.360 --> 22:44.480
make money on it. Right. They're just want to get your money. So that there could be something like

22:44.480 --> 22:50.800
that happening on the Google ad platform. I'm not sure yet, but I'm thinking that this,

22:50.800 --> 22:56.640
we may be seeing that. So we'll have to change how we like kind of do our setup. And so thankfully

22:56.640 --> 23:05.280
for us right now, rare is available and it's working really well. And I've ran, I've ran dozens

23:05.280 --> 23:14.800
of like, look at rare data and look at keyword planner data. And it is almost always spot on.

23:15.440 --> 23:22.160
Sometimes one of the search terms is like 10 or 20 off, but that's more just because like

23:25.120 --> 23:31.440
the API that he's using to pull that data in is probably a month older than what like actual

23:31.440 --> 23:36.560
keyword planner data is. So you might have a month where like search volume increases,

23:37.360 --> 23:42.240
but it like, it hasn't caught up to the API feed that he gets his data from.

23:43.360 --> 23:47.840
So that, but that gets a small discrepancy. And when I've seen it, I can look at it and go,

23:47.840 --> 23:53.600
oh, I know why I can see it. I can see the data difference. And then if I, I'm sure if I go back

23:53.600 --> 23:57.760
and check it, his will get updated the next month. So I think it's just like a little

23:57.840 --> 24:04.320
month delay reporting, but it's, it's been super accurate as far as like for our needs,

24:04.320 --> 24:10.080
as far as that. So I think that that's like the place to, to start doing this stuff out for you

24:10.080 --> 24:17.040
guys. Pretty spot on. Yeah. Yeah. It's been great. I mean, I'm, like I said, I'm, I'm, I'm trying to,

24:17.040 --> 24:24.160
I'm trying to like build a process and then, and build like a kind of like a training video and

24:24.480 --> 24:28.560
like a, like a, like a step-by-step thing. Cause my VA knows main goals really well.

24:29.600 --> 24:36.160
And she, she knows keyword planner. She knows how to like double check with keyword planner when she

24:36.160 --> 24:44.640
has a maybe. But, you know, using how I, how I've been doing due to her, I've had her doing

24:44.640 --> 24:51.360
due diligence using that and rare has been giving me the same info and it's all in one place. So we

24:51.360 --> 24:58.000
don't have to like have multiple tabs, multiple sheets. It takes away a lot of like a lot of time.

24:58.000 --> 25:02.560
Like that's why I have a VA doing it for me now, because it's worth it for me to have them do it.

25:02.560 --> 25:08.960
So I'm not bogged down for hours doing due diligence, but with rare, like if I was just,

25:08.960 --> 25:14.240
you know, by myself, I would rather use that tool because it does all of the stuff for me in one

25:14.320 --> 25:22.160
place. Whereas, you know, how I have it done now, it's like, it's multiple steps on different

25:22.160 --> 25:28.720
software and then we put it into place. So anyways, I'm trying to kind of streamline my

25:28.720 --> 25:35.280
thing so I can now train her how to use it. So that it kind of makes me, it makes sense to her,

25:35.280 --> 25:39.760
but I'd probably get that done like later this weekend or something. So.

25:39.760 --> 25:47.120
Yeah, that makes sense. I wonder why the ads accounts like that, because I had a Google

25:47.120 --> 25:53.040
Keyword Planner through Shiv's group and then it got it suspended. So I made a new,

25:54.000 --> 26:01.120
I used a new Gmail for this one and it's still not working for this. So yeah, it's pretty confusing.

26:02.000 --> 26:09.600
Yeah. Yeah. It's just what it is. I don't know. It's just Google being Google. I wish I could

26:09.760 --> 26:17.040
tell you it was something easy, but like I said, Ryan's thing has done pretty awesome.

26:17.760 --> 26:23.200
And I think that's where you guys should like probably go to.

26:24.240 --> 26:26.000
Okay. Well, I appreciate your help, Jay.

26:26.000 --> 26:29.760
Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. I couldn't solve it anymore, but like I said, I think that's the

26:30.640 --> 26:33.280
issue there. So. Yeah, no problem. I think so.

26:33.280 --> 26:35.600
All right, man. Cool. All right. Take care, man.

26:35.600 --> 26:37.440
Yeah. I'll see you. All right. See you.

26:38.400 --> 26:41.840
All right. Okay. It's just me again. I think we have a few people watching.

26:43.600 --> 26:46.960
Anyone wants to hop in? The Zoom link is there.

26:55.920 --> 27:04.800
For some reason, the chat on my desktop is not caught up on the Facebook. So give me a second.

27:04.800 --> 27:13.680
Okay. I'm going to see if I can like send this to see if this helps like pop it through.

27:14.480 --> 27:16.000
Oh, I see why it's doing it.

27:21.280 --> 27:25.680
Okay. All right.

27:26.480 --> 27:30.160
Let's see if I can go here.

27:33.200 --> 27:38.240
Okay. All right. I am seeing it on my other window. So, okay. We'll just kind of go with that.

27:38.880 --> 27:42.960
So if you guys have any other questions, let me know if you guys want. We have the Zoom open.

27:44.000 --> 27:47.840
I'll kind of leave the Zoom open. And if you guys don't have any questions,

27:48.560 --> 27:54.160
I will start running through some of the DMs I got this week and we can go from there.

27:55.680 --> 28:16.720
Okay. And just like a thing for everyone that's new and listening or seeing the replay of this,

28:17.360 --> 28:23.120
I try to be very, I try to check into the Fix It paid ads account at least twice a day.

28:23.680 --> 28:30.080
I'm pretty consistent with that, just so you know. But like if you guys leave me a DM

28:31.440 --> 28:40.880
and I don't respond and say like, try to give me 36 hours-ish, if you don't hear back from me,

28:41.840 --> 28:46.880
don't be afraid to like just get on the DM and say, hey man, just wanted to see if you got this yet.

28:47.280 --> 28:54.880
So, and I just say that because like sometimes, like say I've got my full-time job and

28:54.880 --> 28:59.760
things are getting busy. Like I may see your question and I recognize your question and I'm

28:59.760 --> 29:04.240
like, well, that's going to take like, you know, that's going to take like, I need to spend some

29:04.240 --> 29:08.880
time. That's not a quick answer. Basically, it's not something, oh, do this or do that. It might

29:08.880 --> 29:14.320
be something where I have to kind of like go sit, think about it, or maybe pull up some info for you

29:14.320 --> 29:19.520
to share with you or try to go find something in the group or something to share with you.

29:19.520 --> 29:24.720
So sometimes like that may happen and it's just, I get distracted or busy. It's not that I'm

29:24.720 --> 29:31.040
forgetful. I just got busy and forgot to get back to you. So just don't be afraid to send back. But

29:31.040 --> 29:37.600
I'm pretty good about trying to get right back to you guys when I can. But I just want you guys to

29:37.600 --> 29:42.080
know that. And at the same time, if you leave me something and I reply back to you, like,

29:42.080 --> 29:47.200
and you don't reply back for like two weeks, don't, when you come back in two weeks looking

29:47.200 --> 29:57.920
for something, don't expect me to jump on and get things going. So let's see. Okay.

29:58.640 --> 30:01.280
Okay. He got that. That was just access issue.

30:14.080 --> 30:23.600
Let's see. Oh, just, hey, I get things like this. Just so you guys know, like people call,

30:24.160 --> 30:29.280
like your people will send me messages and say, like, I'm getting phone calls for my ad,

30:29.280 --> 30:35.040
but there it sounds scammy or people are saying that they've called someone else or it's whatever,

30:35.040 --> 30:40.800
like, just know that like we all deal with that. There's like, you know, there's captcha that you

30:40.800 --> 30:50.640
can do for like to try to reduce like the form span. There's, you know, you can do like the IVR

30:50.640 --> 30:56.720
with like press one or press two to talk to somebody. And that helps like reduce some spam,

30:56.720 --> 31:04.880
but like the sophistication of spam is like, they're always like steps ahead of like the

31:04.880 --> 31:11.920
defense mechanism. So just, just understand that like we all deal with that. And so just,

31:11.920 --> 31:16.080
just kind of take that for what it is. Like, just, just know that like, you're not the only

31:16.160 --> 31:22.160
one going through stuff when that happens. Okay. All right. And anybody that's watching,

31:22.160 --> 31:27.920
if you guys want to hop on to the Zoom, the Zoom link is in the comments. If you have any questions

31:27.920 --> 31:36.800
you want to go over, we can go over your stuff. Let's see here. And then, you know, I don't know

31:36.800 --> 31:42.480
how many times we've got to repeat this, like, stay out of large cities. Like, just don't do it.

31:43.280 --> 31:50.640
Please don't do it. Once you get like experience and you are very confident and you're making money,

31:52.400 --> 31:59.440
you know, then there's ways to like eke into it and niche down and, you know, get better with

31:59.440 --> 32:04.800
your locations and ad groups. And you have to set up multiple location pages and service pages.

32:04.800 --> 32:09.680
Like there's ways to do it, but like, don't jump into it. Don't like, like don't jump into Houston.

32:10.320 --> 32:16.720
You know, like don't, that's, that's not, you're just going to, until you have the experience to

32:16.720 --> 32:21.920
do it, like, you're just going to piss away thousands of dollars. And if you think you're

32:21.920 --> 32:29.280
going to hop into a big Metro market for $5 a day or $5 a click at $20 a day, like you're not going

32:29.280 --> 32:32.880
to make any money. You're not going to have any business owners that are going to be happy with

32:32.880 --> 32:38.480
you. So just take our advice and don't do that, right? Small, smaller cities, like keep it

32:38.480 --> 32:44.000
manageable. Well, once you get experience and you understand this stuff and you can read the data,

32:44.640 --> 32:51.040
that's when you can maybe start doing those bigger city areas. Okay. Some of you guys,

32:51.040 --> 32:56.720
really just a couple of you, like, it seems like every, every couple of weeks I get a message and

32:56.720 --> 33:02.640
you're trying to find a place and it's a constant like, well, don't, don't do that. Okay.

33:09.280 --> 33:17.040
Let's see. Todd, Todd hit me up. Yeah. Todd, if you're here, let me know. I know you had some

33:17.040 --> 33:27.840
questions. Let's see here. Let's see. Is anybody on the zoom? No. Okay. Let's see. We got,

33:27.840 --> 33:42.720
okay. Sarah. Oh yeah. We, we got Sarah square away last week. Okay.

33:49.360 --> 33:54.560
This is something you get this recommendation on and other training. You get this recommendation

33:54.560 --> 34:00.720
from Google is like conversion tracking. Um, on your Weebly one-pagers, to me, there's really no

34:00.720 --> 34:07.280
reason to do it at all. Um, if you set up a full webpage, a full website, and you want to put it

34:07.280 --> 34:15.760
on certain triggers, you can do that. Um, I personally don't think it's worth a big hassle

34:15.840 --> 34:24.880
to do it. Um, the value I see in it is if I'm setting up ads for like someone else's website,

34:25.520 --> 34:34.000
then I might spend time to do it so that it kind of like, you know, uh, how I use it as a way to

34:34.000 --> 34:41.360
kind of like, quote unquote, like show value to them. Um, at the end of the day though, like, um,

34:42.240 --> 34:51.120
like, like my client's phones are ringing and they're getting forms or they're not like, I don't

34:51.120 --> 34:57.840
really care about the conversion stuff unless I'm into some very competitive markets or like high

34:57.840 --> 35:03.600
population areas. I don't really care. I just want the phone ring and I want forms to come in. So,

35:04.400 --> 35:12.960
um, you know, if, if I am doing stuff in like LA and Orange County, um, I got a guy in our land,

35:12.960 --> 35:18.720
I got a couple of people in Orlando right now. Uh, I have somebody in Miami for them. I have,

35:18.720 --> 35:24.720
and it's just, it's for me, um, it's, I'm using it in a way to like,

35:25.600 --> 35:32.720
um, focus on areas that we're getting wins at and then not, um, and then kind of like

35:32.720 --> 35:37.040
be able to like shut down stuff where we're not getting wins at, if that makes sense. So

35:38.480 --> 35:40.320
it's just one of those things. Um,

35:45.280 --> 35:51.760
yeah, somebody wants to buy my leads from me in the group. I understand, but all right.

35:56.960 --> 36:00.080
Okay. Yep. That's caught up. I think there are some more pretty simple stuff.

36:00.080 --> 36:06.080
So, uh, with that, I'm going to hit refresh here, see if there's anything new. Sorry. Um,

36:06.800 --> 36:11.840
okay. Let me see. There's any new comments. I don't see any. Cool. Does anybody have any other

36:11.840 --> 36:16.640
questions or anything? The zoom is open. I'll leave it open for a couple more minutes. Uh,

36:16.640 --> 36:20.400
it looks like there's just a few of you here watching. I don't know who's watching, but

36:20.400 --> 36:27.360
if you guys got any questions, type them in the comments, um, or, uh, hop on the zoom and then,

36:30.480 --> 36:41.920
um, yeah, let's see here. Yep. Yep. Yep. Okay. Cool.

36:46.560 --> 36:52.320
All right guys. Uh, so I guess they're in short and sweet today. Not a lot of people on all good.

36:53.280 --> 37:01.440
For those that are having issues with your Google, um, keyword planner stuff, I highly,

37:01.440 --> 37:06.960
highly, highly recommend that you guys get the rare software from Ryan Dalton. You can reach

37:06.960 --> 37:12.560
out to him directly. I believe there's a discount for digital landlord members right now. I thought

37:12.560 --> 37:19.440
I caught that on Nick's live, I believe, or a post that he did. Um, anyways, we'll just hit

37:19.440 --> 37:25.760
up Ryan. He'll help you out, get you set up there. Um, I've been using it. Um, you know,

37:25.760 --> 37:31.520
I'll start like we just showed earlier with Zach. Um, it's been working really good. So anyhow,

37:31.520 --> 37:35.840
all right guys, uh, let me check zoom one more time. I don't see anybody here. Cool. All right.

37:35.840 --> 37:41.280
You guys have a great one. Uh, take care. You know, if you guys have any questions later, bye.
