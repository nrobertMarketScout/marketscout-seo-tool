Sam Holmes, do you recommend starting an LLC ASAP?

00:03.320 --> 00:04.720
Go get a couple deals, then worry about it.

00:04.720 --> 00:06.340
It's not that big of a deal.

00:06.340 --> 00:08.560
This is not legal advice.

00:08.560 --> 00:09.760
Eventually you wanna do it.

00:09.760 --> 00:11.560
And I've heard people say like,

00:11.560 --> 00:15.040
obviously you wanna go set up an LLC

00:15.040 --> 00:16.880
because you wanna tell yourself

00:16.880 --> 00:17.720
and you wanna tell the world,

00:17.720 --> 00:19.240
you wanna act like you're doing this for real.

00:19.240 --> 00:20.520
This isn't just some dabbling.

00:20.520 --> 00:22.880
And I'm not saying that you shouldn't do it

00:22.880 --> 00:24.000
for those reasons.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.200
What I'm saying is that don't let,

00:26.200 --> 00:28.220
oh, I don't wanna do any cold calls today

00:28.220 --> 00:29.600
because I don't have an LLC.

00:29.600 --> 00:31.360
Don't let that be the thing that stops you.

00:31.360 --> 00:32.640
Go get some deals, man.

00:32.640 --> 00:35.400
I did, let's see, I did the towing deal.

00:35.400 --> 00:36.720
I did the basic waterproofing deal.

00:36.720 --> 00:39.620
I did three or four deals back in 2016

00:39.620 --> 00:41.380
when I first started this

00:41.380 --> 00:43.360
before I even thought about an LLC.

00:43.360 --> 00:45.920
I wasn't even sure this model still would work.

00:45.920 --> 00:47.840
This is back to six years ago, okay?

00:47.840 --> 00:50.560
So if you have somebody that could set it up for you

00:50.560 --> 00:52.520
and whatever, just go, yeah, have them do it.

00:52.520 --> 00:53.360
That's great.

00:53.360 --> 00:54.900
Don't let that be the thing

00:54.900 --> 00:57.040
that prioritizes making cold calls.

00:57.040 --> 00:57.960
Don't let that be the thing

00:57.960 --> 00:59.680
that prioritizes doing due diligence

00:59.680 --> 01:02.960
or doing Zoom closes or whatever.

01:02.960 --> 01:07.120
Make sure to prioritize the things that actually matter

01:07.120 --> 01:09.720
versus the thing that is urgent, okay?

01:09.720 --> 01:11.000
Sometimes those are the same thing,

01:11.000 --> 01:13.280
but a lot of times the things that actually matter

01:13.280 --> 01:14.200
are not urgent.

01:14.200 --> 01:16.160
And so they get pushed to the back burner

01:16.160 --> 01:19.280
and the front burner gets the stuff that's urgent,

01:19.280 --> 01:21.580
but doesn't move the needle, okay?

01:21.580 --> 01:22.880
Always be moving the needle.
