1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
Do you leverage your initial leads to multiple business owners to get more of them on the hook?

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,280
So Rudy, I've done, I've kind of tried both ways.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:12,960
I prefer to stick with one business owner because again, remember what I said to

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,280
Jean or yeah, to Jeannie said, talk about retention, which by the way, Eugene or sorry,

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:21,200
Jean, your issue, you need to get these guys in a contract.

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,680
I think that's going to solve a lot of problems because if they're month to month,

7
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,160
there's no commitment. There is zero commitment. Okay.

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,520
I do a six month contract and it's a 30 day notice of cancellation type of thing.

9
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:37,520
So it's like, yeah. So Rudy, I don't like sharing them with other people.

10
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,280
I like to give them to one company because again, it comes back to this.

11
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,040
If I can get a business owner to make money,

12
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:48,160
I know I'm going to close that business owner. Like I better close that business owner.

13
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:54,400
So I prefer to just give two or three leads to one person and just focus on that one person.

14
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,800
What I found is when you start sharing the leads, like this guy gets it,

15
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,520
this guy gets it, this guy gets it, and you kind of do the round robin,

16
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,800
the lead gets overwhelmed. The lead's like, what is this? They're confused.

17
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:09,600
And the person that closes the job might not be the person that you want to work with.

18
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,960
So I like to just find the person I want to work with, hook them up,

19
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,560
make them money and make it work. Okay. That's just my two cents. You can.

20
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,400
I've done it not on purpose. I have done that before.
