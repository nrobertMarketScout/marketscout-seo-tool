00:00.000 --> 00:15.200
I want you guys to remember that, sell, dinner, not marriage.

00:15.200 --> 00:19.400
I want to talk about the objective of this step of calling the business owner directly

00:19.400 --> 00:21.080
and getting them on the hook.

00:21.080 --> 00:22.080
Why do we do this?

00:22.080 --> 00:24.840
Okay, so I want to share a story really briefly.

00:24.840 --> 00:29.840
Back when I was doing door-to-door sales, I saw this thing happen over and over and

00:29.840 --> 00:34.080
over and I saw this happen as I transitioned into selling software and I had salespeople

00:34.080 --> 00:39.320
and I saw it happen in my own life and I've seen it happen with people in this program

00:39.320 --> 00:40.320
already.

00:40.320 --> 00:41.920
Okay, so I want to tell you about this thing.

00:41.920 --> 00:45.640
All right, so guys, going back to when I sold door-to-door, this actually happened with

00:45.640 --> 00:51.660
me first and what happened is I jumped into this door-to-door thing, I got taught a very

00:51.660 --> 00:52.660
basic pitch.

00:52.860 --> 00:56.460
Okay, they said, here's the stats, go knock on the door, here's what you're selling,

00:56.460 --> 00:59.340
I didn't know much about the product, I didn't know much about sales, I didn't know much

00:59.340 --> 01:00.340
in general.

01:00.340 --> 01:04.140
And I started knocking doors and I started saying this basic pitch and what happened

01:04.140 --> 01:05.140
was crazy.

01:05.140 --> 01:06.400
I started selling deals.

01:06.400 --> 01:09.740
I literally started selling deals, I started just doing what they told me and I started

01:09.740 --> 01:10.980
selling deals.

01:10.980 --> 01:16.380
And what happened is after I hit deal number 17, I hit a slump, okay?

01:16.380 --> 01:22.420
I hit a slump where I, what they call bagel, where I didn't sell for two, almost three

01:22.420 --> 01:23.420
days in a row.

01:23.420 --> 01:25.460
And I know some people, it's like, oh, that's not that much.

01:25.460 --> 01:30.260
To me, that was everything because I was so determined I was going to hit this goal.

01:30.260 --> 01:35.940
I had sold 17 deals, I thought I was going to be, I thought I was it, right?

01:35.940 --> 01:40.860
So to not sell for two days in a row after having just moved my family all the way out

01:40.860 --> 01:45.740
to a different state, my pregnant wife, it was scary.

01:45.740 --> 01:49.260
And then day three, I barely snuck in a deal at the end of the day.

01:49.260 --> 01:52.100
And so that happened to me and I've seen this happen to countless reps.

01:52.100 --> 01:55.460
I saw this happen to my center as well, so I'm going to tell you what it is.

01:55.460 --> 02:04.660
What happens to everyone is they get in to a program, to a sales organization, to whatever,

02:04.660 --> 02:10.460
and they take the basic script, if the training is decent, if they're selling a good product,

02:10.460 --> 02:13.020
and they take the basics of the training, okay?

02:13.020 --> 02:15.980
They don't know much about the product, they don't know much about the training, they just

02:15.980 --> 02:19.980
take the basic overview and they start putting in reps.

02:19.980 --> 02:23.780
And the craziest thing happens, they start to get deals, okay?

02:23.780 --> 02:24.780
Happens every time.

02:24.780 --> 02:26.500
I started to get deals doing door-to-door sales.

02:26.500 --> 02:29.620
Some of you guys that are watching this because you're on version 2.0 and you've already seen

02:29.620 --> 02:33.380
version 1.0, you got your first deal doing exactly what I trained and then all of a sudden,

02:33.380 --> 02:35.940
oh my gosh, I'm in a slump, okay?

02:35.940 --> 02:36.940
Here's what happens.

02:36.940 --> 02:41.620
You get in and you're just being simple and to the point and it makes sense.

02:41.620 --> 02:45.820
And then what happens is you start to learn, you start to learn more about the product,

02:45.820 --> 02:48.680
which is our leads, you start to learn more about the sales process, you start to hear

02:49.000 --> 02:52.960
one-liners from me and from other people, and guess what?

02:52.960 --> 02:55.760
You start to over-complicate the process.

02:55.760 --> 02:59.320
And so for me, what ended up happening back when I was doing door-to-door sales is now

02:59.320 --> 03:03.040
I started to know more about the product, I started to know more about the cellular

03:03.040 --> 03:06.400
connection to this panel, okay?

03:06.400 --> 03:07.840
This security system.

03:07.840 --> 03:08.840
Guess what?

03:08.840 --> 03:09.840
Nobody cares, okay?

03:09.840 --> 03:16.040
And I started to use these extra lines in my pitch because I heard managers using them.

03:16.040 --> 03:19.320
So I just started inserting them when they didn't need to be inserted, okay?

03:19.320 --> 03:22.760
And I saw this exact same thing happen to my setter because this is the part where we're

03:22.760 --> 03:23.760
setting the hook.

03:23.760 --> 03:27.360
I saw this happen to my setter literally a year ago.

03:27.360 --> 03:31.440
She came in, I did 44 minutes of training, I had a lick of sales experience, didn't know

03:31.440 --> 03:36.360
anything about our product, I did 44 minutes of training, I gave her a script and she went

03:36.360 --> 03:41.720
out and set, it was between 10 and 12, she hooked 10 to 12 people, literally week one.

03:41.960 --> 03:46.240
And I was like, holy crap, this chick can ball, okay?

03:46.240 --> 03:47.240
And guess what?

03:47.240 --> 03:52.840
A week, maybe 10 days later, maybe it was two weeks, can't remember, she starts to go

03:52.840 --> 03:53.840
into a slump.

03:53.840 --> 03:57.280
She goes from setting 10 to 12 appointments to setting like two.

03:57.280 --> 04:01.120
And she's like, Nick, I don't know what's going on, I was doing well and I've lost my

04:01.120 --> 04:04.760
edge and oh my gosh, it started to affect her confidence.

04:04.760 --> 04:10.040
And then I started saying, okay, start recording yourself, guys, you should be recording everything

04:10.040 --> 04:11.040
you do, okay?

04:11.040 --> 04:12.480
And I said, start recording yourself.

04:12.480 --> 04:15.200
So she started recording herself and I started going in and watching.

04:15.200 --> 04:16.200
Guess what?

04:16.200 --> 04:22.120
She, not her fault, because I didn't tell her this, but she started trying to sell the

04:22.120 --> 04:24.400
deal on the hook, okay?

04:24.400 --> 04:28.160
She started to, during the process when she would call the business owner, this part right

04:28.160 --> 04:31.200
here, she would start getting into too much information.

04:31.200 --> 04:36.040
She started dropping price, she started telling them about the deal structure, she started

04:36.360 --> 04:42.520
them way too much information and as a result, it confused the customer and as a result,

04:42.520 --> 04:44.500
we stopped hooking people.

04:44.500 --> 04:51.200
Telling you right now that this part of the process, the goal is to sell dinner, not marriage,

04:51.200 --> 04:52.200
okay?

04:52.200 --> 04:55.840
We're not trying to get the business owner to buy on this call.

04:55.840 --> 04:57.820
We're not, okay?

04:57.820 --> 05:01.240
These business owners are going to have to go through a series of steps in order for

05:01.240 --> 05:02.840
us to get this deal.

05:02.840 --> 05:09.240
And so, do not try and sell the deal on this call.

05:09.240 --> 05:12.360
All you're trying to do is get them to the next step.

05:12.360 --> 05:17.560
And the next step is to get them to accept a couple of leads in exchange for a conversation.

05:17.560 --> 05:18.560
That is it.

05:18.560 --> 05:22.800
You are not ever going to sell the deal, you're not going to call somebody out of the blue

05:22.800 --> 05:26.560
and then I say you're never, I'm talking 99.9% of the time, okay?

05:26.560 --> 05:29.080
Now I know, someone's going to go, oh I did it this one time.

05:29.080 --> 05:32.200
I'm telling you, if you do that every time, you're going to lose way more deals than you're

05:32.200 --> 05:33.200
going to gain.

05:33.200 --> 05:36.540
The goal is to get them to the next step and the next step is getting them leads.

05:36.540 --> 05:39.800
You are selling dinner, which is the next step, not marriage.

05:39.800 --> 05:44.000
We're not going in the gate, meeting somebody, meeting a guy, meeting a girl, first thing,

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
boom, let's get married, okay?

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
Not going to happen.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Not going to happen.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.560
And if it does, it's the wrong person, okay?

05:50.560 --> 05:55.760
We want this, we want them to go through the steps so that we can overcome their objections,

05:55.760 --> 05:57.320
they can be sold on the process, okay?

05:57.320 --> 06:02.600
So I want you guys to understand that the purpose, the objective here is to get them

06:02.600 --> 06:07.920
to the next step, not to sell them on marriage, not to sell them on this step.

06:07.920 --> 06:11.600
So I'm going to go into more detail in later videos throughout this module.

06:11.600 --> 06:16.560
However, I want to tell you the two most important pieces of information that you want to hold

06:16.560 --> 06:19.960
off for the proper time, okay?

06:19.960 --> 06:20.960
Two pieces.

06:20.960 --> 06:23.960
Now, there's going to be a lot of things, I don't want you guys talking about extra

06:23.960 --> 06:28.220
stuff and talking about SEO and backlinks and this is how we get it and all this stuff.

06:28.220 --> 06:29.640
Keep it simple, okay?

06:29.640 --> 06:33.080
That should go without saying, there's two things I don't want you talking about right

06:33.080 --> 06:34.080
here.

06:34.080 --> 06:37.920
And number one is I don't want you talking about price, okay?

06:37.920 --> 06:42.160
And number two is I don't want you talking about the structure of the deal.

06:42.160 --> 06:47.660
And so what I mean by that is we all know that this is called flat fee mastery.

06:47.660 --> 06:51.120
The goal is, and the only thing we're going to sell is a flat fee deal, but I'm telling

06:51.120 --> 06:55.800
you right now, if on that first call you start telling them, yeah, it's really awesome.

06:55.800 --> 06:57.100
We don't do paper lead.

06:57.100 --> 06:58.160
We don't do commission.

06:58.160 --> 07:01.840
We just do this flat thing where it costs you the same every month, okay?

07:01.840 --> 07:03.040
You might be sold on it.

07:03.040 --> 07:08.080
You might be excited, but if you tell them this at the wrong time without explaining

07:08.080 --> 07:11.580
why properly and at the right time, you're going to lose them.

07:11.580 --> 07:14.080
And all of a sudden you're going to go, oh my gosh, they seem so interested and then

07:14.080 --> 07:16.240
I called them back with some leads and they ghosted me.

07:16.240 --> 07:17.800
It's because you spooked them.

07:17.840 --> 07:21.400
In their heads they hear flat fee and they hear, oh man, that's all the risk.

07:21.400 --> 07:22.400
I don't know this guy.

07:22.400 --> 07:23.400
I don't know this lady.

07:23.400 --> 07:25.880
Like, I don't want to pay a flat fee.

07:25.880 --> 07:28.360
I want to pay commission.

07:28.360 --> 07:33.320
As most of these people, when you initially call them, they're down to do commission,

07:33.320 --> 07:34.320
okay?

07:34.320 --> 07:37.800
And they might be down to do paper lead, but most of them are not comfortable with flat

07:37.800 --> 07:39.720
fee because they don't understand it.

07:39.720 --> 07:42.600
So if you start talking about flat fee from the get, you're going to lose them.

07:42.600 --> 07:46.600
So when they start asking you, because at some point they might start asking you, say,

07:46.600 --> 07:47.600
so how does this work?

07:47.600 --> 07:48.600
Do I pay you per job?

07:48.600 --> 07:49.600
Or, hey, that sounds good.

07:49.600 --> 07:51.320
Let me just pay you per job.

07:51.320 --> 07:52.320
Don't freak out.

07:52.320 --> 07:54.400
Just say, hey, look, I'm not worried about that.

07:54.400 --> 07:57.640
Let me get you a couple of leads and then let's talk.

07:57.640 --> 08:00.120
Again, sell dinner, not marriage, okay?

08:00.120 --> 08:01.440
Same thing when they start asking price.

08:01.440 --> 08:05.200
A lot of these guys or these ladies, when you call them, they're going to say, okay,

08:05.200 --> 08:07.760
so like how much is this going to cost, like whatever?

08:07.760 --> 08:11.080
And I'm telling you, I know that you're going to want to say, oh, it's probably going to

08:11.080 --> 08:13.760
be about a thousand bucks a month.

08:14.560 --> 08:19.600
When you have it in the wrong context, sounds like a ton of money, but a thousand bucks

08:19.600 --> 08:23.280
a month in the right context, explained the right way is nothing.

08:23.280 --> 08:24.520
And that's the way we want to do it.

08:24.520 --> 08:27.360
We want to make sure to show them all the value, show them how much money they're going

08:27.360 --> 08:29.240
to make and then show them price.

08:29.240 --> 08:32.560
But if you do that thousand bucks a month and you compare it to a cell phone, yeah,

08:32.560 --> 08:34.280
it seems expensive, okay?

08:34.280 --> 08:36.960
So my word of advice is this.

08:36.960 --> 08:41.680
If somebody starts asking questions too early about price, about deal structure, okay, or

08:41.720 --> 08:43.840
about anything, but those are the two main ones.

08:43.840 --> 08:48.480
All I want you to do is make it seem like not a big deal and let them know, you know,

08:48.480 --> 08:50.680
let's talk about that later, but let's not put the cart before the horse.

08:50.680 --> 08:55.120
So my go-to is, hey, look, they say, hey, so what's this going to cost or, hey, let

08:55.120 --> 08:57.120
me give you a quick, you know, let me give you a percentage.

08:57.120 --> 09:02.480
Look, hey, honestly, sir, honestly, ma'am, I don't want to put the cart before the horse.

09:02.480 --> 09:04.640
I don't even know if this is going to be a good fit for both of us.

09:04.640 --> 09:05.640
So let me do this.

09:05.640 --> 09:08.160
Let me get you a couple of leads and then we can talk in a couple of days.

09:08.160 --> 09:10.240
And just so you know, I'm very flexible.

09:10.240 --> 09:11.480
I'm very creative.

09:11.480 --> 09:12.600
I'm not worried.

09:12.600 --> 09:13.920
That's the easy part.

09:13.920 --> 09:18.000
Let me just earn your trust and let's make sure this is a good fit and then we can work

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
this out.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
But I'm not that stressed.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Okay.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
Heck.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.600
And sometimes I'll even joke like, heck, I'll take food stamps, like, you know, ha ha ha.

09:25.600 --> 09:26.600
Okay.

09:26.600 --> 09:30.200
Guys, sell dinner, not marriage, and just take the pressure off.

09:30.200 --> 09:34.320
You know damn well you're going in for the flat fee deal at a certain price.

09:34.320 --> 09:39.200
You already know that, but you don't need to add added pressure to the deal because

09:39.200 --> 09:44.920
pressure is not something that helps a deal at this point in the deal.

09:44.920 --> 09:45.920
Okay.

09:45.920 --> 09:50.320
So recap, we're selling dinner, not marriage.

09:50.320 --> 09:52.800
Do not share too much information.

09:52.800 --> 09:54.800
And if you're going through this for the first time, you're going to be like, what are you

09:54.800 --> 09:55.800
talking about?

09:55.800 --> 09:58.960
I promise you, you need to know this because at some point you're going to start selling

09:58.960 --> 10:02.400
deals and then you're going to go to what's called a slump and it ain't slump.

10:02.400 --> 10:04.200
You're just sharing too much information.

10:04.200 --> 10:05.520
You're talking out of order.

10:05.520 --> 10:08.960
You're sharing information that needs to be held on until later.

10:08.960 --> 10:09.960
Sell dinner, not marriage.

10:09.960 --> 10:10.960
I'll see you in the next video.
