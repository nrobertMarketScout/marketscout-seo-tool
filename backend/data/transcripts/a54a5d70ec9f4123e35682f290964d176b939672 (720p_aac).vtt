Guys, I don't think we should have to say this, but if you're using freaking gift cards or some

00:06.480 --> 00:11.120
other shit, just, I'm not even going to go into that, but like you should be smart enough to know

00:11.120 --> 00:15.360
that's not a good idea. I mean, think about it like this. If one of your clients said, Hey,

00:15.360 --> 00:21.360
can I put this, uh, this gift card on your Stripe account? You'd say, hell no. Because then what

00:21.360 --> 00:25.840
happens next month when it declines, I got to chase you down. You think Google's any different

00:25.840 --> 00:31.920
except for they're, uh, uh, worth 500 billion times more than you and I combined. Like,

00:31.920 --> 00:37.840
of course not. So just be smart as far as like, put yourself in their shoes. You do the same

00:37.840 --> 00:42.960
damn thing as them. I would, I'd suspend everyone's ass and say, well, it's what I'm doing, right?

00:42.960 --> 00:47.520
Like everyone, like, I don't just give you the application to this program. I'm like, go find

00:47.520 --> 00:52.240
fucking thing. And, and, and if you really want to get in, you'll bug me about it. Right? Like I want

00:52.240 --> 00:56.400
people that are serious. And that's what happens when you, you have something like it's like Google

00:57.200 --> 01:03.120
guys back to the law of control, right? The person that cares the least or appears to care

01:03.120 --> 01:08.400
least has all the control. Google has what we need. They have this platform called Google ads.

01:08.400 --> 01:13.120
They do not need our money. They can get money from any, any, everybody else. So therefore they

01:13.120 --> 01:17.360
have all the control and we have to abide by their freaking stupid ass rules. I don't like it any

01:17.360 --> 01:23.680
more than you do, but again, I would do the same thing. So what I'm getting more than even just a

01:23.680 --> 01:30.240
tactical is just like looking at this going, like just instead of treating it like, oh my gosh,

01:30.240 --> 01:35.920
I'm such a victim. Look at it as like, Hey, everyone's going to deal with this. But instead

01:35.920 --> 01:41.840
of me just like being so pissed off, I'm going to master this suspension thing. Because if this has

01:41.840 --> 01:45.600
happened to me, it's probably a problem with multiple people and there's an opportunity there

01:45.600 --> 01:50.960
to help. And so it's like, that's exactly what Jeff did. And now it's like, okay, this is,

01:50.960 --> 01:56.960
this is interesting because he has the skillset and this knowledge that he has acquired by going

01:56.960 --> 02:02.560
through the thing. So just change your mindset of like, it sucks. I get it. But guess what?

02:03.840 --> 02:07.600
It is, it is what it is. It is what it is. It's part of the business. It's a very small and

02:07.600 --> 02:13.920
significant thing. And some of you guys that are freaking out about it, it's like, I just question

02:14.000 --> 02:19.760
how the hell you were raised because like that, if this is throwing you off that bad,

02:20.480 --> 02:24.080
I don't know how you guys coped with stress. Like I've really,

02:25.760 --> 02:29.840
it's, it's wild anyway, but we're talking about a very small subset of people.

02:31.440 --> 02:35.840
I think that's true too. Like just like you said, it's going to happen. It's going to happen to you

02:35.840 --> 02:41.840
again. It's going to happen to me again. At the same time, like, you know, this isn't everybody's

02:41.840 --> 02:47.120
having these issues. So as far as the training goes, like, you know, follow the training,

02:47.120 --> 02:52.880
do what's there. And it could be like your fifth website that gets a flag on it. Like it's not,

02:52.880 --> 02:57.520
it's not necessarily like, if you don't do this, don't like take the action. It's okay.
