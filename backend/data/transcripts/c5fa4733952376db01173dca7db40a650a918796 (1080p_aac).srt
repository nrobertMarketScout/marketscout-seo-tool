00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,420
["Take Me By Your Side"]

2
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:12,820
Everyone has the same question,

3
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:15,860
and they always ask, hey, what should I expect?

4
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:17,740
Like, what's actually possible?

5
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:19,460
If I come in this program, I go through it,

6
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,020
like, what could I do?

7
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,260
How much money could I make?

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,420
How many deals could I get?

9
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,060
Okay, and I will tell you right now

10
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:29,020
that there are people in this program

11
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:30,340
that have already done this,

12
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:34,060
and in their first month, they have done eight deals.

13
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,700
No kidding, we have a student that got in

14
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:40,500
within 25 days, eight deals, okay?

15
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,580
We also have a student that took a little bit longer.

16
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:44,340
It took them five weeks to get a deal.

17
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:49,340
They got a deal for $5,400 per month, one single deal, okay?

18
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:55,620
So, the possibilities are great,

19
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,580
but I wanna set expectations,

20
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:00,420
just like you should with your clients, right?

21
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,460
Just when the business owner says,

22
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,440
hey, how many leads could I reasonably expect?

23
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,620
You're not gonna go and tell them,

24
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:09,460
hey, you know, I got this guy named Bob,

25
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:11,740
and he has this site, and it's getting 100 leads.

26
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,780
Cool, Bob has 100 leads,

27
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:16,820
but if you set the expectation for 100 leads,

28
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:19,900
you are going to be just dealing with a mess, okay?

29
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,980
So, I wanna set the expectations right here,

30
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:25,560
and the goal and the expectation is that within 30 days,

31
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,280
you should at least have your first deal,

32
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,220
and you need to realize, like,

33
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:32,300
I need you to get your deal in 30 days,

34
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,520
as bad as you need to get your deal in 30 days,

35
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,560
because that's how I grow, and once you get your deal,

36
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,720
I'm going to do an interview,

37
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,120
that's gonna be more social proof,

38
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,560
and that's just how this works.

39
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,000
So, I am very, very invested in this, just like you are,

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,720
because I need you to get deals,

41
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,880
but I just wanna set the expectation that,

42
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,520
I know some of you are gonna listen to that and go,

43
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,360
oh, one deal, like, that's it?

44
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,920
I got way bigger goals, that's cool,

45
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,720
and I'm really cool with that,

46
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,220
but here's what I understand,

47
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,160
is the first deal is the most important.

48
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,760
So, the goal is, and the expectation is,

49
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,600
follow the training, go through the modules,

50
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,780
do as I've instructed, okay?

51
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:11,280
Go through them, each one, and do exactly what it asks.

52
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,780
Don't just watch it, and then don't do anything.

53
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,800
Do exactly what it asks you to do,

54
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,740
and the expectation I have for you,

55
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:19,700
and you should have for yourself,

56
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,240
is that within 30 days, within the first month,

57
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:26,020
you are getting your very first flat fee deal.
