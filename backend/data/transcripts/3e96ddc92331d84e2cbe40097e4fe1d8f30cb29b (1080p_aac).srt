1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,480
Now that we have expanded our keyword list, I'm going to give you a list of rules that

2
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,240
we follow when we are writing content.

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,280
Whether you're going to outsource the content to someone or you're writing it yourself,

4
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:24,540
we still follow these rules and they're very basic rules that we follow by.

5
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:29,520
One piece of advice is I would actually, if this is the first website that you're starting

6
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,560
on, I would actually write the content myself.

7
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:37,680
I know it's a pain, but by doing so, you know exactly what you're going to outsource and

8
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:43,720
it's always better to know what you're doing before you give that word to someone else

9
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:48,160
because that way you can set expectations and you know what you want back.

10
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:54,040
So here's starting, let's start, I'm going to write a paragraph.

11
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,400
So again, we use Basecamp.

12
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,400
All right.

13
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,400
So I created a new doc.

14
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:02,320
I'm actually going to, I usually keep them separate for each page.

15
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:08,600
So we're going to talk about this later, but each page, I would probably keep it a separate

16
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,600
doc.

17
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,960
I'm talking about the content.

18
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:16,520
So homepage, content, name it whatever you want.

19
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,520
Okay.

20
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,520
And let's just start with a little paragraph so you can kind of get an idea.

21
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:29,000
So number one rule is the first word of your paragraph, especially on the homepage, especially

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,880
the very top paragraph, the one that we put that little corner image, you want it to be

23
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,200
a keyword.

24
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:42,480
So if you're, if your website is Queen concrete or whatever it is, you probably want to be

25
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:53,720
saying something like Queen Creek concrete.

26
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,880
Or you can even, cause you always, so one of the rules is you actually want to sound

27
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,760
like you own the company.

28
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:06,520
So you don't want to sound like a third person or a third party or just in a weird way, you

29
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,360
always want to sound like you are the owner of the company.

30
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:17,720
So you can say something like here at Queen Creek concrete and remember that your company

31
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,240
name is going to be the location and the service.

32
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,760
Keep it simple.

33
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,940
So in my case, it's Queen Creek concrete.

34
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:29,360
If it was in Las Vegas concrete, I would just say here at Las Vegas concrete and keep that

35
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,360
consistent because if you change the name within the content, you're going to sound

36
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,360
unprofessional.

37
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:39,680
So you want to keep it consistent and keep the name of the company that you have assigned

38
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,440
yourself the same as in the header, the same as in the content everywhere, the same as

39
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,640
in the, in the GMB everywhere.

40
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,040
You are called Queen Creek concrete.

41
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,120
Just keep it consistent.

42
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,280
Do not have 10 names because an actual company would have one name only.

43
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,280
Okay.

44
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,960
So here we go here at Queen Creek concrete, we, and again, talk as if you were part of

45
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:19,240
the company, we at, we offer service, we offer all types of residential and commercial concrete

46
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:36,080
services and then whether, whether you are looking for concrete driveway or concrete

47
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,840
patio, we have got you covered.

48
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,840
Okay.

49
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:47,840
I'm going to pause and kind of read you some of the rules that we have.

50
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,400
So number one, again, start with a keyword.

51
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,400
Okay.

52
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,800
Queen, Queen Creek concrete is a keyword because we have the location and the service.

53
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:03,960
Another one would be to create a bullet list and I would keep it one bullet list or a number

54
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:09,720
list, whatever list you want to do per 1000 words.

55
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:14,560
And what that is, is you don't want to start with a bullet list that looks a little silly.

56
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:21,560
So after you've read a couple of sentences, you can put something like here are some,

57
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,840
we'll keep a space in between.

58
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,440
Okay.

59
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:42,520
Here are some of the top services that our local contract, contract tours cover.

60
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,760
And here's where we do the bullet list.

61
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:51,800
The reason why we do a bullet list is because it's a very easy way to add keywords.

62
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,800
Okay.

63
00:04:52,800 --> 00:05:07,480
We can put concrete driveway, stand concrete, concrete patio, concrete, I don't know, decorative

64
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:13,480
concrete, whatever it is, whatever your company you really want to rank for.

65
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,720
And you can, you can make it longer.

66
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:22,240
Of course, don't make like a two, two little items or a thousand, like keep it smooth and

67
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,240
professional.

68
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:28,120
Another, another easy way to get some ideas on what content to write.

69
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:33,400
You can actually get on Google and if you type concrete driveway near me, which is what

70
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,800
we're trying to go after.

71
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,240
And I'm sure you guys have seen this before.

72
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:45,560
If you go down here where it says people ask for, Google will give you an idea of what

73
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,120
people are looking for and their writing.

74
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:53,280
So you can even write these rhetorical questions within your content.

75
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,560
That's a very easy way you can.

76
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:00,800
So this one would be a great question because you can, and this is a really easy way to

77
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,640
get ideas on what content you're going to write about this subject.

78
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,640
Okay.

79
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,640
This is a great question.

80
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,120
What is stamped concrete driveway?

81
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,120
Okay.

82
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,120
So you can put that in here.

83
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,320
And again, we'll rearrange the content to run smooth.

84
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:25,440
What is stamped concrete driveway?

85
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:31,240
This could be one of our titles in the content and then you go and answer and say, stamped

86
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:52,840
concrete driveway is a great way to personalize and get the exact look that you have been

87
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,840
looking for in a driveway.

88
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,840
What is stamped concrete?

89
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:24,840
Our professional constructors will be able to give your concrete any texture.

90
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,840
I think they can do color too.

91
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:38,440
You want, I think, a type of the card of color, different pattern, textures, and color.

92
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,440
Okay.

93
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,440
We can add pattern as well.

94
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:46,440
Texture, pattern, and color.

95
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:51,760
So they can make concrete look like stone, but they can make concrete, you know, have

96
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,760
any type of pattern.

97
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,040
And that's really cool.

98
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:58,040
So that's a great way to add some content right there.

99
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,040
And this is a great tool.

100
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:05,040
And the more you actually expand these questions, the more questions come up.

101
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,040
So this is a very, very good idea.

102
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:13,040
One rule that we also usually follow is try to avoid the word cheap.

103
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,040
So we don't really put cheap concrete service.

104
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,040
That sounds like it's not really good quality.

105
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,040
So instead of using words like cheap, we use affordable.

106
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,040
Just be smart about the words that you're using.

107
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:27,040
Don't make it sound like you're Walmart, but make it sound like your actual professional

108
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,040
local company.

109
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:37,040
So then we have do not use more than 10 of the same keywords per thousand words.

110
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,040
That's why we expanded the keyword list.

111
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:44,040
So do not use the same 10 keywords per thousand words.

112
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:47,040
And that includes the location as well.

113
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:52,040
So not just concrete patio, but also don't keep saying here in New York, here in New

114
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,040
York, here in New York, or here in Queen Creek.

115
00:08:54,040 --> 00:09:00,040
Do not keep repeating that more than 10 times per thousand words.

116
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:06,040
And I'm actually going to show you some resources and tools that you can use to track that down.

117
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:10,040
And then use both short tail and long tail keywords.

118
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:15,040
So make sure you are using something very short like concrete patio as a keyword, but

119
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:25,040
also you're also using something more lengthy like concrete driveway repair here in Queen

120
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,040
Creek, Arizona.

121
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,040
That would be a long tail.

122
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,040
They're both important.

123
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:35,040
Make sure after you're done writing your content, if you're writing the content yourself, you

124
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:41,040
probably know whether you plagiarize the content or you've wrote it yourself.

125
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:48,040
If you are outsourcing, make sure that you're checking the plagiarism and you're not copying

126
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,040
and pasting content from anywhere else.

127
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,040
This will really penalize you.

128
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:59,040
And you want to keep the plagiarism percentage below four percent.

129
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:04,040
Make sure, again, the company name, in my case, Queen Creek Concrete, that it's on your

130
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:08,040
header is always consistent everywhere.

131
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,040
Include the phone number in your content.

132
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:15,040
So like something that I really like, I think it's very easy and a good way, a good rule of thumb

133
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:21,040
would be to add the phone number once, at least once every thousand words.

134
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,040
And that's a very easy way.

135
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:26,040
You could say something like whether you're looking for a concrete driver or concrete patio,

136
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,040
we've got you covered.

137
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:48,040
And if you want to receive a free instant quote, get in touch with us by calling the following number.

138
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:55,040
And here's where you're going to add the phone number that we got from CarRail.

139
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,040
If I can find it.

140
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:02,040
Anyway, I'll add it in later.

141
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:07,040
I'll just put X, X, X, X, X, because I know that will mean adding the phone number.

142
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,040
OK, next rule, spell check everything.

143
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,040
A really good tool to have.

144
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,040
It's actually Grammarly.

145
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:21,040
So Grammarly, I'm pretty sure you have to pay for it.

146
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:26,040
There may be free tryout, but this is what it is.

147
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:32,040
You can actually add it on as an extension and it will follow you wherever you are,

148
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,040
whatever you have Basecamp or your website builder.

149
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:43,040
And not only it will spell check every word, but it will also rephrase the sentences to make them better.

150
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:49,040
So that's a very easy way to spell check and actually make the sentences.

151
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,040
And it will also correct like the punctuation.

152
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:56,040
So it's a really great tool to have.

153
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:59,040
And then again, write as if you were the owner.

154
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,040
Don't make jokes.

155
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,040
Don't try to be funny.

156
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:05,040
Again, we're not writing this to be entertaining.

157
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,040
Be simple.

158
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,040
Keep sentences short.

159
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,040
Keep it simple.

160
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,040
Don't plagiarize the content.

161
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:18,040
Make it like it's just a simple description of what the company does and what you do and what you offer.

162
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,040
And keep the keyword density.

163
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,040
What we talked about earlier.

164
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:28,040
Do not use the same keyword more than 10 times per thousand word.

165
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:34,040
Another way of looking at it is keep the keyword density less than five percent.

166
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,040
And here is a really good tool for that.

167
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,040
You can also use this to check for plagiarism.

168
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,040
It's free.

169
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:54,040
So just go on SEO review tools dot com and then you're going to add that one.

170
00:12:54,040 --> 00:13:05,040
Let's do keyword density checker.

171
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:10,040
OK, it's super easy because you just put in so you can do the text input.

172
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:14,040
You can also put the domain that you have.

173
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:20,040
In my case, it would probably be text input because I haven't copied the content to my website.

174
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:28,040
So I'm actually just going to do this copy and paste it in here.

175
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:39,040
Perform check.

176
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:52,040
OK, see, I already need to edit my content because I've said that I know that you're like, OK, well, it's 10 times the actual extension of the keyword or the short keyword.

177
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,040
And I would say the short.

178
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,040
So I said concrete way too much.

179
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:02,040
The density right here is 19 percent and we want to keep it less than five.

180
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:14,040
So go ahead and go in and add more sentences, maybe some sentences that don't have keywords just to make it less.

181
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,040
And again, keep that less than five.

182
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:24,040
And then another another tool that we use is actually the duplicate content.

183
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:34,040
Cancel that part out and just type duplicate content.

184
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:40,040
Oops. Maybe click right here should give you the option duplicate content checker.

185
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:51,040
And that's the same thing. You can go ahead and plug in your domain at the very end if that's easier or you can text input your stuff.

186
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,040
Perform check.

187
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:01,040
And this one, you want to keep below four percent.

188
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,040
Perfect. There is no duplicates. Of course, we just wrote that.

189
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:09,040
And that is that is it for content.
