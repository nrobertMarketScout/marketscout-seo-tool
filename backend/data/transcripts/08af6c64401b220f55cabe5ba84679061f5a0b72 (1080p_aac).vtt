OK, Martin says, are most business owners on Angie's

00:02.480 --> 00:03.760
home advisor paying for leads?

00:03.760 --> 00:05.600
I thought only it says sponsored or verified.

00:05.600 --> 00:07.680
Yes, well, it depends.

00:07.680 --> 00:10.080
Not all, not all are on.

00:11.360 --> 00:12.800
And that's why I prefer Google ads.

00:12.800 --> 00:13.840
Somebody's paying for Google ads.

00:13.840 --> 00:14.640
You see, it says sponsored.

00:14.640 --> 00:15.920
That means they're currently paying.

00:17.840 --> 00:19.840
Home advisor angels doesn't necessarily mean they're paying.

00:19.840 --> 00:23.120
So what I'll do is I've in my head, I'm assuming they're not.

00:23.680 --> 00:26.240
I'm assuming they maybe got verified and they were paying.

00:26.240 --> 00:27.680
But you know, the annoying thing with home advisor,

00:27.680 --> 00:29.520
they can turn it off, they can turn it on.

00:29.520 --> 00:30.640
So I assume that they're not.

00:30.640 --> 00:32.800
But I still in my head, I'm like, at one point,

00:32.800 --> 00:34.880
they went through the process of getting on home advisor

00:35.760 --> 00:36.960
and they might still be paying.

00:36.960 --> 00:39.520
So I would prefer they're paying for Google ads.

00:39.520 --> 00:43.760
But no, that doesn't always mean that they're currently paying.
