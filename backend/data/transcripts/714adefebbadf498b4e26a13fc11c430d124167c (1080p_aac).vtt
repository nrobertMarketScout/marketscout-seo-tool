WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:14.400
Alright guys, let's go ahead and close the deal.

00:14.400 --> 00:18.640
So as we talked about in the last lesson, once we get through, we're going to finish

00:18.640 --> 00:24.360
off the shit sandwich, which is we're going to end on a positive note before we go for

00:24.360 --> 00:25.360
the close, right?

00:25.360 --> 00:29.660
So the bun, which is good, the shit, which is the price, which they can view as a negative.

00:29.660 --> 00:31.820
And then the bun, which is good, and then the price.

00:31.820 --> 00:34.580
So remember, shit sandwich should be pretty easy to remember, right?

00:34.580 --> 00:39.500
So what I do right before I ask for the deals, I lay out everything that they get, okay?

00:39.500 --> 00:43.380
So I like to look at all the things and separate them, all the stuff that they get.

00:43.380 --> 00:47.060
So I'm going to go, alright, so let me just tell you, just so we're on the same page,

00:47.060 --> 00:49.940
Mr. Business Owner, this is what's included in the deal, okay?

00:49.940 --> 00:52.860
So first thing is, it's 100% exclusive, okay?

00:52.860 --> 00:54.660
Like I'm not sending these to anybody else.

00:54.660 --> 00:56.580
As long as you're working with me, you're working with me.

00:56.580 --> 00:59.220
Nobody else in this area, okay?

00:59.220 --> 01:00.660
Or concrete, okay?

01:00.660 --> 01:04.060
We also get, you also get the tracking number on the website.

01:04.060 --> 01:08.220
Guys, I know that you're like, no, that's a no-brainer, but guys, if you separate each

01:08.220 --> 01:12.060
of these pieces, think about, I think Alex Hormozi talks about this in his book.

01:12.060 --> 01:14.300
You separate all of these individual pieces.

01:14.300 --> 01:17.380
If they were to do a tracking number with just a regular service like CallRail, I think

01:17.380 --> 01:19.580
it's like 50 bucks to do a basic plan, right?

01:19.580 --> 01:21.020
So it's a $50 a month value.

01:21.020 --> 01:22.020
So I'm adding that.

01:22.020 --> 01:23.640
So I'm going to go back into it.

01:23.640 --> 01:27.980
So we also get the tracking number option, which it's really cool because, not the option,

01:27.980 --> 01:28.980
sorry.

01:28.980 --> 01:32.820
We also get the tracking number on the website, which is super cool because we can forward

01:32.820 --> 01:35.980
this directly to your number, which is what we're going to do.

01:35.980 --> 01:37.820
And it's going to give you a whisper message to you.

01:37.820 --> 01:42.460
You'll know exactly what calls are coming from this website.

01:42.460 --> 01:46.220
Plus it's going to record everything and we have a bunch of other capabilities.

01:46.220 --> 01:50.580
Like if we want to do a round robin or let's say you don't answer because you're on a job,

01:50.580 --> 01:53.740
we can then send it to your secretary or your sales guy.

01:53.740 --> 01:55.140
Like there's a lot of cool stuff with that.

01:55.140 --> 01:56.620
So you also get the tracking number.

01:56.620 --> 01:59.900
It doesn't cost you any additional money.

01:59.900 --> 02:03.780
And then I'll let them know and you get access to our dashboard.

02:03.780 --> 02:06.940
And I'm thinking in my head, CallRail, right?

02:06.940 --> 02:07.940
And you can let them know.

02:07.940 --> 02:11.700
So with the dashboard, you're going to be able to log in and view all the recorded calls.

02:11.700 --> 02:13.700
You're going to be able to see the call flow.

02:13.700 --> 02:15.620
You're going to be able to check out the leads.

02:15.620 --> 02:21.060
You'll have your own login to our platform, which again is CallRail.

02:21.060 --> 02:26.620
Then I will mention, I'll say, Hey, we also, not only are we going to be ranking in the

02:26.620 --> 02:30.740
organic section for the actual website, but we're also, and I'm going to need your help

02:30.740 --> 02:35.560
a little bit with this, but we're also going to be able to get in that map section.

02:35.560 --> 02:39.580
So we're going to build out a map listing that goes hand in hand with this.

02:39.580 --> 02:41.940
You're going to get all the leads that come from that as well.

02:41.940 --> 02:45.040
And there's companies out there, Mr. Business Center, they only do that.

02:45.040 --> 02:47.200
So they'll charge you just to manage that.

02:47.200 --> 02:49.880
So we're going to do that as part of our deal.

02:49.880 --> 02:53.680
And don't guys, don't make this sound like they're going to get that as their own.

02:53.680 --> 02:56.840
This is part of the lead gen deal, but just let them know they get the leads from that

02:56.840 --> 02:57.840
as well.

02:57.840 --> 02:58.840
Okay.

02:58.840 --> 02:59.840
So yeah, we're going to do that.

02:59.840 --> 03:04.260
It's called GMB or I guess it's a Google, it's GBP, Google Business Profiles.

03:04.260 --> 03:07.320
And probably when you watch this, it's going to be something else, right?

03:07.320 --> 03:09.360
We're going to optimize that, put pictures and stuff.

03:09.360 --> 03:11.840
We're probably going to need a little bit of help, but all the leads that come from

03:11.840 --> 03:13.200
that you're going to get as well.

03:13.200 --> 03:14.200
Okay.

03:14.200 --> 03:15.200
So we will handle all that.

03:15.200 --> 03:16.200
I am going to need you to help me with an address.

03:16.200 --> 03:18.120
We'll talk about that in a minute.

03:18.120 --> 03:22.180
And then here's the last thing is I'm going to give you first right of refusal on any

03:22.180 --> 03:23.740
deals that we do in the area.

03:23.740 --> 03:25.480
So like with Queen Creek, we're using that example.

03:25.480 --> 03:31.360
So for example, Mr. Business Owner, like if I decide that we want to expand into Mesa,

03:31.360 --> 03:34.400
before I go and just call another business owner that's your competitor, I'm going to

03:34.400 --> 03:35.400
come to you first.

03:35.400 --> 03:40.040
Then I'm going to say, Hey, Brian, do you have any interest in Mesa?

03:40.040 --> 03:43.920
And you're going to have the opportunity to jump on and sign for that deal before anybody

03:43.920 --> 03:45.680
else before I even talked to anybody else.

03:45.680 --> 03:46.680
Okay.

03:47.280 --> 03:49.760
Just so you know, that is teeing them up.

03:49.760 --> 03:54.800
First of all, you're including it as a bonus or as a good advantage that comes with it,

03:54.800 --> 03:59.840
which it is, but also you're teeing them up to say, Hey, this guy's looking to expand.

03:59.840 --> 04:02.880
And when you hit them up and say, Hey, remember how I told you, I give you first right of

04:02.880 --> 04:03.880
refusal?

04:03.880 --> 04:04.880
Yep.

04:04.880 --> 04:05.880
I'm going into Mesa.

04:05.880 --> 04:06.880
Do you want any leads there?

04:06.880 --> 04:11.160
And you automatically have them teed up to get second money, third money, fourth money

04:11.160 --> 04:12.160
on these deals.

04:12.160 --> 04:14.160
Guys, you see how brilliant this is, right?

04:14.160 --> 04:15.160
Completely laid out perfectly.

04:15.160 --> 04:16.160
Okay.

04:16.400 --> 04:17.400
We are going to ask for the deal.

04:17.400 --> 04:18.400
And here's how I do it.

04:18.400 --> 04:21.600
I use what's called an assumption clause and it's actually kind of an assumption slash

04:21.600 --> 04:22.600
option.

04:22.600 --> 04:25.600
And so what an assumption clause is, and I know some of you guys have been in sales and

04:25.600 --> 04:28.120
you're like, Oh my gosh, Nick, this is very basic.

04:28.120 --> 04:29.520
An assumption clause.

04:29.520 --> 04:31.400
It means you're assuming the sale.

04:31.400 --> 04:32.600
You're assuming the deal.

04:32.600 --> 04:36.560
So guys, what I'll do is I'll end, I'll mention all of the good things, right?

04:36.560 --> 04:39.480
And then a high note, and then I'll just be really smooth and say, cool.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.720
So all I got to do and I'll search around for my pen.

04:41.720 --> 04:42.720
Like you could see me naturally.

04:42.720 --> 04:43.720
I'll grab my pen or whatever.

04:43.720 --> 04:45.760
I'll be like, let me grab my pen.

04:45.760 --> 04:49.520
So all I got to do to get you guys, or to get you going is grab a card from you.

04:49.520 --> 04:51.360
Are you an Amex or a Visa?

04:51.360 --> 04:52.360
Okay.

04:52.360 --> 04:55.680
And I'll just look down like I'm writing or I'll look right at the screen or I'll grab

04:55.680 --> 04:56.680
my pen.

04:56.680 --> 04:59.080
Like I'm getting ready to write down the number and I'll wait.

04:59.080 --> 05:03.280
Are you an Amex or a Visa?

05:03.280 --> 05:06.720
Okay, wait.

05:06.720 --> 05:11.720
And I'm telling you right now, if you've done the setup correctly and if you've done all

05:11.720 --> 05:15.040
the steps correctly and you've sent the leads the way that we've taught and you've, you've

05:15.320 --> 05:19.840
prospected the right person, you've done all of those things, it is going to shock you

05:19.840 --> 05:22.040
when they go, give me one second.

05:22.040 --> 05:23.120
Let me grab my card.

05:23.120 --> 05:25.480
And you're going, oh my gosh, is this happening?

05:25.480 --> 05:26.480
Oh my gosh.

05:26.480 --> 05:27.480
Oh my gosh.

05:27.480 --> 05:28.480
Brain.

05:28.480 --> 05:30.160
And you just don't get too excited.

05:30.160 --> 05:34.840
I remember the first couple of times this happened to me, I started talking too much.

05:34.840 --> 05:35.840
I was like, cool.

05:35.840 --> 05:36.840
Yeah.

05:36.840 --> 05:37.840
Sounds good.

05:37.840 --> 05:40.560
So man, the other cool thing is this, the other cool thing is it's like, just relax.

05:40.560 --> 05:41.560
Okay.

05:41.560 --> 05:42.560
Just act like you do this every day.

05:42.560 --> 05:43.560
Okay.

05:44.080 --> 05:46.920
And the first time you do this, you're like, holy shit, I just got this deal, baby.

05:46.920 --> 05:47.920
Let's go.

05:47.920 --> 05:50.600
And you want to fist bump, save it till the zoom calls off.

05:50.600 --> 05:51.600
Okay.

05:51.600 --> 05:52.600
Just be calm.

05:52.600 --> 05:53.600
So yeah, no problem.

05:53.600 --> 05:55.160
I'm actually just going to get everything set up while you're doing that.

05:55.160 --> 05:56.960
And you're over there just biting your nails.

05:56.960 --> 05:58.260
They're going to give you the card.

05:58.260 --> 05:59.820
You're going to, and here's what you're going to do.

05:59.820 --> 06:03.560
If you get the deal right here, and in the next video, we're going to talk briefly about

06:03.560 --> 06:04.560
objections.

06:04.560 --> 06:08.240
But if you get the deal right here, which you will more often than not, if you do this

06:08.240 --> 06:09.240
correctly.

06:09.240 --> 06:10.240
Okay.

06:10.240 --> 06:12.680
And like, I'm talking most of the time.

06:12.680 --> 06:16.440
What I would recommend you doing is just writing the information down and that's going

06:16.440 --> 06:20.400
to lead us to two videos from here where I'm going to show you how to set this up in Stripe

06:20.400 --> 06:25.520
or into another merchant account, whatever, but you're just going to write down their

06:25.520 --> 06:31.080
credit card information, their code on the back, their expiration date, their first and

06:31.080 --> 06:34.360
last name and their zip code on a piece of paper.

06:34.360 --> 06:37.800
That's the easiest way to do it because I know some people where they're like, let me

06:37.800 --> 06:38.800
send you an invoice.

06:38.800 --> 06:40.240
I just asked them for the credit card.

06:40.240 --> 06:43.160
I'm going to write the damn thing down on a piece of paper and I'm going to go set

06:43.160 --> 06:44.160
it up.

06:44.160 --> 06:45.160
Okay.

06:45.160 --> 06:48.360
So right there, if you've done it correctly, you're going to get the deal.

06:48.360 --> 06:51.720
And if you guys have skipped a step, you're going to find out and you're, they're going

06:51.720 --> 06:56.040
to go, yeah, Nick, like, yeah, haha, that's smooth, man.

06:56.040 --> 06:57.040
Haha.

06:57.040 --> 06:58.040
I like that.

06:58.040 --> 06:59.040
Right.

06:59.040 --> 07:00.040
Some of them are going to say that they're going to go.

07:00.040 --> 07:01.040
So here's what I'm going to do.

07:01.040 --> 07:02.040
And you're like, oh, here we go.

07:02.040 --> 07:04.880
And they're going to say, so I'm going to give me about a day.

07:04.880 --> 07:08.680
I'm going to talk to my, my spouse or I'm going to talk to my partner and, and I'll

07:08.680 --> 07:09.680
let you know.

07:09.880 --> 07:15.880
And all of a sudden, as they start saying it, you go, oh shoot, I forgot about the partner.

07:15.880 --> 07:16.880
Okay.

07:16.880 --> 07:22.320
And that leads us into the video that we're going to talk about next, which is about objections.
