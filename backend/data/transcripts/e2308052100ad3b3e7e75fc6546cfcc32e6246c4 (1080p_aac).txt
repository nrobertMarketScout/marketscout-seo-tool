Pick a contract length. Decide, are you going to do a contract? In my opinion, you're crazy
not to do a contract. Pick a contract length and say, I'm doing this contract. I'm not giving them
the option of month to month. I'm not giving them the option of what type of contract. We're doing
one contract and we're doing a contract. For me, it was a six-month contract. Now, you go in and
they won't agree to a contract and you have to do a three-month instead of a six-month to get the
deal. Fine. But you have it in your head. You're only going to do one. You're only going to focus
on when you're going to pitch one.
