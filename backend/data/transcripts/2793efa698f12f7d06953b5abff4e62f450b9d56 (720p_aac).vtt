Nick, have you tried the painting niche you painted out?

00:02.040 --> 00:02.560
Never done it.

00:02.880 --> 00:08.240
Um, don't love it just because it's kind of like drywall, just some of those

00:08.240 --> 00:11.960
construction niches where like the, the builders, they have their guy, they have

00:11.960 --> 00:15.280
their crew and everything else is those bullshit little jobs.

00:15.280 --> 00:15.880
I don't love it.

00:15.920 --> 00:17.320
I think you could squeeze a deal out of it.

00:17.360 --> 00:20.560
It's not a niche I'm going vertical with though, but good question.
