1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,920
Do you always go for six-month agreement or go for 12 and reduce to six?

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,640
You can go whatever the hell you want. Like it depends like

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,840
Like honestly for me and this is the same thing

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,880
I like the reason I like six months ray is because I personally I

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,600
Like I don't want to be stuck with someone that sucks

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,000
Like just as bad as they don't want to be stuck in a contract. I don't want to be stuck in a contract

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,960
I had this exact same thing happen with a piece of uh, with a property that I own a

8
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:32,240
Uh an office i'm subleasing all the little offices out and we had this client come in

9
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:38,080
And or this potential tenant and they were like, yeah, we'll probably just do a 12 month and honestly i'm like

10
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,880
I don't know how much money these guys have they say they're gonna park their vehicles outside

11
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,400
They kind of seem like they're like, I don't know. I was just getting this vibe and i'm like I told my wife

12
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:53,600
I'm like, let's just do a six month so that we are not stuck with these bastards for for a year

13
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,040
And

14
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,400
They've been really good so far

15
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:02,160
But we did a six month and honestly like their vehicle like they parked their vehicles in the house or at the office

16
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,640
They're not super nice vehicles. They paid in cash. I'm like do these guys even have money and honestly

17
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:14,240
A couple days after we signed the six month. I told I turned to my wife. I'm like, aren't you glad we did six months?

18
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,200
So ray the reason I do a six month instead of a 12 typically is because I I honestly

19
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,680
Who knows maybe I get a better offer maybe I find somebody else that's willing to pay more money

20
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,520
So I would specifically tell you if you're if you're at a price point

21
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,240
You don't think is what you want to be at do a shorter agreement

22
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,600
Ask kareem because I think it was him

23
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:38,480
He told me the same exact thing as he he was going for like a six month ended up doing a two month

24
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,200
And he's like dude, i'm actually kind of glad I did a two month now because i've been absolutely crushing it

25
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:47,440
So now at the end of you know in the next four weeks, he's gonna be able to bump that up

26
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,440
So that's just my personal thing

27
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,120
There's a pro though to having a 12 month because then you have to worry about it

28
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,080
So, um, I know burhan, uh signed a 12 month the other day on a towing deal

29
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,560
So it's up to you
