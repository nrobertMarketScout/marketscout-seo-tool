00:00.000 --> 00:03.360
So here's what you're going to do, Edward. I would make sure to do everything you can,

00:03.360 --> 00:11.360
get this sucker ranked, manage those expectations, and get ready to get that business owner into a

00:11.360 --> 00:16.800
sixth month to a year contract as soon as possible. What I would do is after month two,

00:17.680 --> 00:20.800
I would start, I would figure out maybe we need to bump up the ads a little bit.

00:21.760 --> 00:27.600
Maybe we need to like check in extra, whatever, because I know that between month two and three

00:27.600 --> 00:32.800
is when I need to renew. And if you don't renew for at least six months in October,

00:34.320 --> 00:37.520
there's a good chance they're going to cancel. If you go to a month to month,

00:37.520 --> 00:41.600
by December things slow down and it's Christmas and all these different things,

00:42.160 --> 00:46.400
it's going to be a problem. So what I would do is I would crush it for this person in both areas.

00:47.360 --> 00:51.600
In between months two and three, I would really up my game so that you can get those

00:51.600 --> 00:56.000
re-signs into the six month a year contracts. And then you could kind of take a little bit

00:56.000 --> 01:01.440
of a deep breath and go back to your strategy. But from experience, that's what I would do.

01:02.480 --> 01:08.000
Also a friendly reminder, guys, I would not be recommending a six month contract right now.

01:09.280 --> 01:15.200
August, September, October, November, December, January, that's going to put you in a really

01:15.200 --> 01:20.400
weird spot. You're going to have a contract ending at the end of Christmas. And unless you're in the

01:20.400 --> 01:24.960
snow removal niche and you're in a city that has snow year round, which I don't know if there are

01:24.960 --> 01:30.560
any, it's going to be a problem. So guys, I know the training says six month contracts,

01:30.560 --> 01:34.560
but we have to also use our head. Right now, I would do what Edward is doing. I would either

01:34.560 --> 01:38.960
do a three month or I'd do a nine month. I would definitely push for the nine month before the

01:38.960 --> 01:45.360
three month. But keep in mind, if you do a six month, the contract's going to end in the middle

01:45.360 --> 01:50.320
of the freaking winter and it's going to be a problem. It's really hard to renew contracts,

01:50.320 --> 01:53.440
relatively speaking, in the middle of the winter.
