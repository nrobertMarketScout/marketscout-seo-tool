Zolan, my problem is I'm so focused on finding an EMD available for a city.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:09,840
If it isn't available, I move on. Dude, quit worrying about exact match domains, bro.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,040
The domain doesn't matter. And by the way, I'm not mad. I'm just telling you.

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:21,040
Doesn't matter. Does not matter. This is my format. I do the city. I do

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,480
Bentonville Concrete. Second option is Concrete Bentonville.

6
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:32,240
Third option is Bentonville dash like hyphen concrete dot com.

7
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,080
The next option after that would probably be.

8
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,800
I don't know if you'd have to go pass up, but if you did, I might do. I've done this before

9
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:47,360
and ranked it Bentonville concrete co dot com. I have a St. George concrete co dot com is ranking

10
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,640
guys. The domain doesn't matter. You don't need the exact match. Okay. We're in local. We're not

11
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:58,800
ranking sex toys nationally, which would be very difficult. Okay. Because that's highly searched.
