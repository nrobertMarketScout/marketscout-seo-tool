Robert says, Nick, do you try to sign first the BO that is on top of the sponsored ad section?

00:05.280 --> 00:11.920
Do you check there? I don't really care if they're at the top or not. As long as they're running ads,

00:11.920 --> 00:17.440
they're going on my list. But yeah, I mean, checking their reviews is not a bad thing.

00:17.440 --> 00:21.280
If I'm looking at the reviews, they're like, oh, this guy is rude. This guy had no customer service.

00:21.280 --> 00:24.400
That's going to be my partner. And that means they're probably not going to close deals. So

00:24.400 --> 00:26.960
that's going to be an issue. I want to check into all those things. So Robert,

00:26.960 --> 00:30.640
check into those things. But yeah, anyone at the top is going on my list. That's part of our

00:30.640 --> 00:36.560
training or part of our module and building your list. So yes. Okay.
