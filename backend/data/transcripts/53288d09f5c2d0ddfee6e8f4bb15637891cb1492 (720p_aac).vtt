00:00.000 --> 00:04.480
And then it also, I think the other thing too, it depends how many leads have you sent him?

00:04.480 --> 00:08.160
Is this your first lead? Is this your fifth lead? Because if I've already set this guy three,

00:08.160 --> 00:13.920
four leads, you got to remember guys, you don't need to wait until they close a job,

00:13.920 --> 00:19.600
until they close a lead to go and run the call, right? Like Porter, did that guy close any of

00:19.600 --> 00:24.960
those deals you sent him? No, his estimates are today. So he hasn't even done one.

00:24.960 --> 00:29.280
I was just going to say, and sometimes you're going to send them a few leads. They're not even

00:29.280 --> 00:32.240
going to get to the leads and you're going to close them. And you could just tell one of the

00:32.240 --> 00:37.200
reasons Porter, Porter's got a really good example right now of momentum, the power of momentum. You

00:37.200 --> 00:40.640
get that deal and you get that second deal and you get that third deal and you get that fourth

00:40.640 --> 00:45.840
deal. Then you get that fifth deal. And my guess is his sixth and seventh deal. He's two deals away

00:45.840 --> 00:53.120
from hitting 10 K guys in two and a half, three months. So that question, Theo, it depends on what

00:53.120 --> 00:59.440
lead number you're at. And if you're asking like, like, are you asking because you're worried that

00:59.440 --> 01:03.440
it's going to sound like you're desperate or are you asking because you think you should just send

01:03.440 --> 01:07.200
it before he actually talks to the homeowner? I'm not really sure what you're asking, but just

01:07.200 --> 01:12.000
remember you don't need them to close a lead. You actually don't even need them to run the lead.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.200
You just like, if it feels right, it feels right. And you just go for it. Okay.
