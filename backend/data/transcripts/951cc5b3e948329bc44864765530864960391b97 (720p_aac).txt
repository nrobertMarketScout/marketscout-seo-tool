Guys, don't think you need to talk.
Don't think that there's a certain timeline you have to know the business owner for two weeks or seven days or two months to be able to sell them right and there's proof of this and the reason that I have said that I shared this before.
I used to think you have to know somebody for a certain amount of time for them to be able to trust you right.
But that's not true because we all know those people that we've known our whole lives and we wouldn't trust them with a spaghetti sandwich right and we also know those people that like you meet them and you just know that they're good people you're like dude I just feel like this is a good guy.
So it's not about the time.
It's about the value delivered within the time. Right. So, and when you're first starting you don't think that it's possible like how could I possibly meet somebody today cold call them today.
And then hours later, I'm getting a credit card for a six month contract there's no way and then you realize yeah there is a way.
Every time but you will start to see that.
