Okay. Marie says, I was doing a soft touch with the business owner today after handing off a lead and he was hardcore pressure me about price.

00:06.000 --> 00:15.000
I held out the best I could but divulged that it would be a flat fee without a pay I ended up comparing it to being like him quoting a concrete job and it's the best case.

00:15.000 --> 00:27.000
And that it's a case by case scenario. He was finally satisfied but is there something better I can say. Great question, Marie, I actually just filmed a video in module five this morning about this.

00:27.000 --> 00:37.000
My go to when they keep going price price price price price guys write this down. I just try and go hey don't put the carpet before the horse we'll talk about that later but if they keep pressuring you for price.

00:37.000 --> 00:48.000
Say look man. It literally depends on a lot of stuff. I have clients like just to give you a range I have clients that are paying me between three and 500 bucks a month, and I have a client to pay me $40,000 a month.

00:48.000 --> 00:54.000
Okay, it's going to fall somewhere in there. No, but seriously, obviously it's going to be closer to the bottom and the top.

00:54.000 --> 01:05.000
It's going to depend. And then go back to what you're talking about. Okay, give them a range. Okay, look bro I don't know. Okay, I don't know you're in a different city, you're in a different city than the other guy.

01:05.000 --> 01:15.000
So I got to look at the competition, I got to look at what's going to take me, I don't have an answer for you but I do, I can tell you a range. Okay, and that's kind of how I throw it back on them and they're like, okay, cool.

01:15.000 --> 01:22.000
Okay, so that's what I do I don't even bring up the floppy sounds like you said it in a way that didn't scare them so you're good.
