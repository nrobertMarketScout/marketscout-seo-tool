1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,800
Okay, now that we have the page title and the page description, we are going to create

2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,840
the H1 tag, text right here.

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:19,440
It's actually pretty simple because the H1 is pretty much the page title just flipped.

4
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:25,520
So we're going to put the location first and then we're going to put the services.

5
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:31,500
So just what you put here, we put concrete contractors and concrete company.

6
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:37,240
So I'm literally just going to put, so I'm going to click in it and I'm going to put

7
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:43,480
my location, which is in my case, Queen Creek, Arizona, and then you can structure this however

8
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,480
you like.

9
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,560
I think it looks clean if you put a little line there, but you can also just go ahead

10
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,600
and just put the keywords that we used.

11
00:00:52,600 --> 00:01:00,280
So concrete contractors.

12
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:06,920
This may be too long to fit, also I'm putting that, but I usually like to use the actual

13
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:15,080
three letters and concrete company and then click out of it.

14
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,760
Let's see what it looks like, okay.

15
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:24,080
I do like it to be a little more bold and then just double check how it looks like from

16
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,880
a phone.

17
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,720
Yeah, that's fine.

18
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,080
Keep in mind, I know this sounds like silly, but we're only doing this because Google is

19
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:37,640
going to crawl our website and we're just doing the on-page SEO.

20
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:42,960
We're not doing this to make it look, because obviously this is the same thing.

21
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,160
Oops.

22
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,240
And then make sure you don't put concrete twice.

23
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,240
Okay, let's delete that out.

24
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,240
Perfect, it should look even better now.

25
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,040
Okay, concrete contractors and concrete company.

26
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,160
You may ask, well, can I just put concrete contractors and company?

27
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:10,640
No, because the keyword is concrete company, not just company.

28
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,320
You might as well just take out concrete company and just leave concrete contractors if it's

29
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,320
really bugging you.

30
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,320
Okay, next one, stamped concrete.

31
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,320
Okay, same thing.

32
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,320
Same thing as your page title.

33
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:27,320
Location first, so you flip the page title.

34
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:40,320
Oops, stamped concrete and decorative concrete.

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Make it a little bigger.

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Perfect.

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Okay, concrete driveway.

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I don't remember.

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I think concrete installers is what we put, okay.

40
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Queen Creek, Arizona, concrete driveway, and concrete installers.

41
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,680
Make it a little bigger.

42
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,680
Perfect.

43
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,680
Concrete patio.

44
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:26,680
Queen Creek, Arizona, concrete patio, and concrete walkway.

45
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:37,360
Okay, and you're done because we're not doing the contact page.

46
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,360
We are also going to cover the meta keywords.

47
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,360
So, we used to fill this section right here.

48
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:53,360
We don't do it anymore on our very latest sites, but this is up to you if you want to

49
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,360
do it or not.

50
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,040
We don't think that it's going to hurt you if you put meta keywords, but we're not sure

51
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,040
that it's really doing much by adding them.

52
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,040
So, what meta keywords are, it's very simple.

53
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,040
I'm just going to show you how to do it on the home page.

54
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:11,040
It's pretty much you just add in keywords from your keyword list, and you separate them

55
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,040
with a comma.

56
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,040
And it will tell you right here, separate each with a comma.

57
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,040
So, it would be concrete contractors.

58
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,040
It is just a list of keywords.

59
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,720
Concrete company, stamped concrete.

60
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:30,720
Make sure that when you're doing this, you're not just copying and pasting it from...

61
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,720
Like, don't ever copy the description for the home page and put it in the service page.

62
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,720
Everything needs to be authentic and made fresh for each page.

63
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,720
Same with the meta keywords.

64
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,720
Even if you're using the same keywords over and over, it doesn't matter.

65
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,720
Don't ever copy and paste.

66
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,720
Flip them, you know, switch them.

67
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,400
If you're writing everything fresh, you're never going to have that issue.

68
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,400
So, just try not to do that.

69
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:02,400
Concrete driveway and concrete patio.

70
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,400
Okay.

71
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:08,400
And that is it for H1 titles and meta keywords.
