WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.440
Okay, if I'm still good, and by the way, Aaron, I know Aaron isn't going to be able to be

00:07.440 --> 00:08.840
on to the very, very end.

00:08.840 --> 00:16.720
So at about the three quarter mark, so I'd say, let's see, in about 45 minutes, Aaron's

00:16.720 --> 00:21.920
going to do a screenshot and anyone that's on this, just as a reminder, anybody that's

00:21.920 --> 00:27.040
on this, this live stream till the end, we're automatically going to send you the digital

00:27.040 --> 00:28.920
resource that we're going to create from this thing.

00:28.920 --> 00:31.320
So you guys don't have to worry so much about taking notes.

00:31.320 --> 00:33.360
I want you to just sit there.

00:33.360 --> 00:37.880
I want you to take notes of the things that come to your mind, not the things that I'm

00:37.880 --> 00:38.880
saying.

00:38.880 --> 00:41.960
Because the things that I'm saying, we're going to send you guys in a digital resource.

00:41.960 --> 00:45.800
I want you to take notes on the things that come to your mind, the ideas that are generated

00:45.800 --> 00:47.760
from the things that I'm saying.

00:47.760 --> 00:49.480
I think those are the most important things.

00:49.480 --> 00:50.480
Excuse me.

00:50.480 --> 00:54.560
And then Aaron's going to send you a digital resource that we create.

00:54.560 --> 01:00.400
So that said, guys, yeah, appreciate you guys being on.

01:00.400 --> 01:01.480
We're going to keep doing these.

01:01.480 --> 01:07.980
I like doing these sessions much better because the people that are on these are serious.

01:07.980 --> 01:09.600
They're trying to actually make moves.

01:09.600 --> 01:11.960
They're actually trying to do something with the information.

01:11.960 --> 01:16.160
And it's not just a consumption fest like it sometimes turns into in the free group.

01:16.160 --> 01:19.240
So I, again, I don't care if there's three people on this call.

01:19.240 --> 01:23.680
It looks like we have about 14 people on this call, which is great.

01:23.800 --> 01:28.160
Ironically, that's about the same or more than we were getting, even when we were going

01:28.160 --> 01:30.560
live inside of Facebook.

01:30.560 --> 01:32.240
So anyway, welcome to the call.

01:32.240 --> 01:33.240
Appreciate you guys being on here.

01:33.240 --> 01:35.060
And I'm going to make this worth your time.

01:35.060 --> 01:38.040
This isn't something that I'm just going to pull out of my head, even though I could,

01:38.040 --> 01:39.040
because I've done this.

01:39.040 --> 01:40.040
I've talked about this a million times.

01:40.040 --> 01:43.520
But I took, you know, I think it took me about 45 minutes.

01:43.520 --> 01:48.560
I got all my thoughts on the paper, put them in order, exactly the things I want to cover

01:48.560 --> 01:49.760
and I'm going to go over that right now.

01:49.840 --> 01:53.640
So, guys, today we're going to be talking about niches and seasonality.

01:53.640 --> 01:59.040
And if you haven't noticed already, I'm really harping on the, you know, the niche and city

01:59.040 --> 02:01.520
selection first.

02:01.520 --> 02:05.040
And the reason why there's a million things we could talk about, we could talk about sales

02:05.040 --> 02:08.080
and there's a trillion things inside of sales.

02:08.080 --> 02:14.400
We could talk about, you know, hooking business on which is part of sales, we could talk about

02:14.400 --> 02:19.680
building lists, we could talk about what else could, I mean, there's

02:19.680 --> 02:23.160
so many different things we could talk about, you know, doing the actual technical stuff

02:23.160 --> 02:26.600
on your agency, setting up the business, what type of business.

02:26.600 --> 02:29.360
There's really, really unlimited topics for me to talk about.

02:29.360 --> 02:38.560
But again, as I've repeated the last couple of weeks is if you don't nail this part correctly,

02:38.560 --> 02:39.920
everything becomes tough.

02:39.920 --> 02:40.920
Everything becomes very difficult.

02:40.920 --> 02:46.440
And so I've commonly said inside of, inside of digital landlords, inside of the free group

02:46.440 --> 02:50.840
is the money is made in the buy, not the sell.

02:50.840 --> 02:54.920
Meaning if you don't pick the niche and city correctly, it doesn't matter how good you

02:54.920 --> 02:55.920
are at sales.

02:55.920 --> 02:57.560
It doesn't matter how good you are at SEO.

02:57.560 --> 02:58.560
Everything becomes more difficult.

02:58.560 --> 03:00.000
Your ads are more expensive.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.360
It's harder to rank.

03:01.360 --> 03:05.440
It's harder to find the right business owner if you can even find one at all.

03:05.440 --> 03:08.600
And on the flip side, if you've picked the right niche, you picked the right city, you

03:08.600 --> 03:10.640
nail that.

03:10.640 --> 03:13.640
Everything else becomes easy and easier.

03:13.640 --> 03:14.640
I've had deals.

03:14.640 --> 03:20.200
I specifically remember one, I didn't do so many due diligence worksheets, but I just

03:20.200 --> 03:26.320
stumbled across a very, very, you know, I would say low hanging fruit is the term I

03:26.320 --> 03:29.200
like to use something that, you know, there's high search volume.

03:29.200 --> 03:30.560
It's a perfect niche.

03:30.560 --> 03:35.960
It's also got a lot of, you know, it had, you know, very low competition.

03:35.960 --> 03:40.960
I put up a website and it wasn't even something I was like, I didn't really have the bandwidth

03:41.080 --> 03:46.760
to even build a website at that time, meaning I was so busy with other projects and pre-selling

03:46.760 --> 03:49.080
and doing and trying to scale the specific niches.

03:49.080 --> 03:53.640
But I just saw this, this opportunity and it was so good.

03:53.640 --> 03:55.480
I was like, I'm a fool if I don't do this.

03:55.480 --> 04:00.080
So I literally just went on, I bought the domain, I passed it over to my team, which

04:00.080 --> 04:05.080
at the time consisted of like one person that I have hired in Africa, his name is Peter

04:05.080 --> 04:06.080
and then Francesca.

04:06.080 --> 04:08.240
And I said, Hey, can you just build this out?

04:08.240 --> 04:14.440
Just get me like a thousand words on the homepage, 250 to 500 on the service pages, you know,

04:14.440 --> 04:15.440
just the bare minimum.

04:15.440 --> 04:17.800
Give me a tracking number and just like, I don't even want backlinks.

04:17.800 --> 04:20.440
I don't want to worry about SEO, nothing.

04:20.440 --> 04:23.800
I don't care about GMB, just get this thing live.

04:23.800 --> 04:28.440
And I did this and I actually forgot about it.

04:28.440 --> 04:35.240
I forgot about it for like six weeks and I was checking in with another client who I

04:35.360 --> 04:40.360
had in mind when I built this because they had my site in the city next door within the

04:40.360 --> 04:41.780
same niche.

04:41.780 --> 04:43.760
And I went and reached, I just did like some basic stuff.

04:43.760 --> 04:49.040
I cleared my search history and lo and behold, within six weeks, I was completely not just

04:49.040 --> 04:53.720
on page one, but I was top two or three for every single search term.

04:53.720 --> 04:57.680
And these are like the main key search terms in the city.

04:57.680 --> 05:01.080
And I didn't do anything and I didn't even build the website completely how I like to

05:01.080 --> 05:02.080
build it.

05:02.080 --> 05:03.080
I usually like to do 2000 words on the homepage.

05:03.400 --> 05:05.960
I like to do 500 to 1000 on the service pages.

05:05.960 --> 05:11.720
H1 is done properly, H2 is done properly, the page titles, all that stuff.

05:11.720 --> 05:16.800
We didn't really do it that great of a job, but because it was such a good opportunity,

05:16.800 --> 05:21.600
I did nothing, just built the project, let it sit there, let it sizzle, let it simmer.

05:21.600 --> 05:25.600
And I came back and in six weeks that thing was completely glued to the top.

05:25.600 --> 05:31.680
So that is why I am such a big proponent and why I'm going to continually talk about the

05:31.680 --> 05:33.840
city and niche combination, the due diligence.

05:33.840 --> 05:37.360
And I know this is like the third week in a row that we've been talking about it with,

05:37.360 --> 05:43.520
especially with this new format going into like really deep, nuanced stuff.

05:43.520 --> 05:44.520
But this is important.

05:44.520 --> 05:48.840
And like the topic today is we're going to talk about niches and seasonality.

05:48.840 --> 05:53.920
And it may sound like something that you could cover in one sentence and I probably could.

05:53.920 --> 06:00.360
However, at the same time, guys, I've lost thousands of dollars by not doing certain

06:00.360 --> 06:01.360
things.

06:02.040 --> 06:03.040
By the way, Aaron, there's somebody in the waiting room.

06:03.040 --> 06:04.040
I don't know if you saw that.

06:04.040 --> 06:06.960
And let me know if that'll let you admit them.

06:06.960 --> 06:11.120
And also, Aaron, until we get to about the halfway mark, you can continue admitting people

06:11.120 --> 06:12.120
after that.

06:12.120 --> 06:13.440
Then don't make sure they're muted as well.

06:13.440 --> 06:16.880
So today, guys, we're going to be talking about seasonality and niches.

06:16.880 --> 06:19.800
For those of you that weren't on last week, for those of you that are maybe brand new

06:19.800 --> 06:26.920
to the group, just a two second or maybe, I guess, 30 second brief on me is, you know,

06:26.920 --> 06:28.120
obviously, my name is Nick.

06:28.120 --> 06:32.160
I started the free group art of pre-selling or sorry, it was the art of pre-selling the

06:32.160 --> 06:33.240
art of digital real estate.

06:33.240 --> 06:37.880
I also started and run the group called Digital Landlords.

06:37.880 --> 06:43.360
It's my paid community that I created from my experience in building and scaling a rank

06:43.360 --> 06:44.360
and rent agency.

06:44.360 --> 06:50.240
I've been doing this since 2016 with a tiny little, you know, shiny object, whatever in

06:50.240 --> 06:52.280
there where I was gone for about nine months.

06:53.080 --> 06:56.560
For the better part of eight years, I've been doing this.

06:56.560 --> 07:01.640
I have lost millions, and I say millions, it's not just an arbitrary number, actually

07:01.640 --> 07:07.280
multiple millions of dollars I have lost on building niches in the wrong cities, in the

07:07.280 --> 07:13.160
wrong states, in the wrong building websites, sorry, in the wrong niches and cities, in

07:13.160 --> 07:14.160
the wrong states.

07:14.160 --> 07:16.400
I have lost money hiring the wrong people.

07:16.400 --> 07:19.160
I've lost so much money on Google Ads.

07:19.160 --> 07:20.840
And I've also made millions of dollars.

07:20.840 --> 07:26.520
And over the last, since 2020, we have been doing at least seven figures and we're never

07:26.520 --> 07:27.520
going to go back.

07:27.520 --> 07:31.400
OK, so 2020, we finally figured out the missing pieces to this business model.

07:31.400 --> 07:34.600
Many of you guys have probably heard of this business model, maybe in the past.

07:34.600 --> 07:37.560
Build a website, rank it, go rent it out.

07:37.560 --> 07:38.560
That's great.

07:38.560 --> 07:39.560
There's missing pieces to it.

07:39.560 --> 07:41.840
The due diligence process has to be perfect.

07:41.840 --> 07:43.720
You have to consider the CPC.

07:43.720 --> 07:46.920
You also need to realize if you want to scale this thing, you need to sell your website

07:46.920 --> 07:50.680
first, get a client first, and then build a website on the back end, unless you have

07:50.680 --> 07:54.400
unlimited time and unlimited money, you need to pre-sell and you need to flip this thing.

07:54.400 --> 07:57.760
So I figured out all these missing pieces in 2020.

07:57.760 --> 08:01.920
And in eight months, we went from eight to ten thousand dollars a month, with half of

08:01.920 --> 08:05.160
that being SEO, to a hundred thousand dollars per month.

08:05.160 --> 08:09.360
Eight months later, in July of 2020, a hundred percent lead generation, SEO was completely

08:09.360 --> 08:10.360
separate.

08:10.360 --> 08:12.000
I'd given that away and was taking a cut on it.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.000
That was 2020.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.960
In 2021, we did one point four or five million.

08:16.800 --> 08:21.360
December 1st, 2021, after having so many different people hit me up with questions, hey, how

08:21.360 --> 08:22.360
are you getting deals?

08:22.360 --> 08:23.360
How are you selling?

08:23.360 --> 08:24.360
How would blah, blah, blah.

08:24.360 --> 08:27.360
I realized I needed to launch something and teach people how to do this the way that I

08:27.360 --> 08:28.360
did.

08:28.360 --> 08:30.200
The way that I did it that allowed me to scale.

08:30.200 --> 08:36.800
So that said, that's kind of, I guess, would be what if you're sitting here going, why

08:36.800 --> 08:37.800
the heck should I listen to this guy?

08:37.800 --> 08:40.800
That's what I'm going to give you.

08:40.800 --> 08:43.520
And at the same time, I want you to take everything that I'm giving you.

08:43.520 --> 08:44.680
And I don't just want you to accept it.

08:44.680 --> 08:46.680
I want you to think about it.

08:46.680 --> 08:49.160
I want you to be intuitive about it.

08:49.160 --> 08:50.480
And I want you to test it.

08:50.480 --> 08:52.160
I don't want you to accept what I'm saying.

08:52.160 --> 08:56.680
But I will tell you, I've been in this game a long time and I know what I'm talking about.

08:56.680 --> 08:58.040
And if I don't, I don't say it.

08:58.040 --> 09:00.320
So anything that I say is what I've done.

09:00.320 --> 09:06.400
So that's a little bit of why I think it's worth your time to stay on this call, as well

09:06.400 --> 09:09.360
as the fact for those of you that just joined at the end of this call, if you are still

09:09.360 --> 09:13.160
on, we are going to send you a digital resource with notes.

09:13.200 --> 09:15.200
Basically, it's going to look nice.

09:15.200 --> 09:16.200
It's going to be a PDF.

09:16.200 --> 09:19.720
You're going to be able to just, you know, quickly have all of the stuff that we cover

09:21.280 --> 09:22.400
PDF.

09:22.400 --> 09:23.960
And so that's kind of the deal.

09:23.960 --> 09:26.000
So what the game plan is.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.000
Hold on. Let's make sure we're muted here.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.840
Yeah, so I just muted them.

09:31.840 --> 09:34.920
No problem. Is there a setting you can just keep everyone auto muted when they join?

09:34.920 --> 09:35.560
We'll check it out.

09:35.560 --> 09:37.840
I'm trying to find it, but I'll just search it.

09:37.840 --> 09:40.160
It's completely fine. And by the way, I do get it.

09:40.160 --> 09:41.920
By the way, I've had this happen to me before.

09:41.920 --> 09:43.360
So if that was you, it doesn't matter.

09:43.360 --> 09:45.160
I just want to make sure that we can all get through this quick.

09:45.160 --> 09:50.000
So here's kind of the outline of what I want to or I guess my promise to you on this

09:50.000 --> 09:54.800
call is my goal for today's training over the next thirty nine.

09:54.800 --> 09:56.520
Let's see, what is going to be forty five?

09:56.520 --> 10:02.080
Yeah, forty four minutes is I want you guys to realize that things change

10:02.080 --> 10:05.160
in this business as the seasons change.

10:05.440 --> 10:10.360
OK, and there are certain things that you must do in order to protect yourself

10:10.360 --> 10:11.840
against these changes.

10:11.840 --> 10:14.760
And as well, I'm going to give you guys some tips for avoiding any issues

10:14.760 --> 10:18.560
whatsoever that would normally arise as a result of the changing seasons.

10:18.560 --> 10:22.400
Now, some of you guys are sitting here going, man, it's it's July, almost August.

10:22.400 --> 10:26.080
We're still a couple of months away from, you know, winter, at least in the US.

10:26.560 --> 10:30.360
And and by the way, if you're not in the US, then the same principles apply.

10:30.600 --> 10:32.920
But your summer might be different than my summer.

10:32.920 --> 10:35.200
Like I know in Australia, the summer I think is flipped.

10:35.400 --> 10:37.640
Summer is during my winter in the US.

10:38.640 --> 10:40.600
So just take the principles.

10:40.600 --> 10:43.760
Don't necessarily, you know, go well on my summers at a different time.

10:44.040 --> 10:47.200
Just take the principles that I'm teaching and then apply it to your situation.

10:47.560 --> 10:50.200
I'm talking about it right now because this is something

10:50.200 --> 10:52.720
that needs to be on your mind right now.

10:52.720 --> 10:54.520
And it's going to affect the way you sell.

10:54.520 --> 10:57.080
It's going to affect the niches that you go after, the cities that you go after,

10:57.080 --> 10:59.680
the way that you do the deal, you structure the deal,

10:59.680 --> 11:00.920
the things that you say to the business owner.

11:00.920 --> 11:04.680
I know this sounds very nuanced and I don't want you guys to get overwhelmed.

11:04.680 --> 11:07.440
But you need to understand that this is something I didn't know.

11:07.800 --> 11:11.560
And two years in a row, it almost put me out of business

11:11.560 --> 11:15.280
because I didn't understand this principle, OK,

11:15.280 --> 11:19.400
which is that that niches have seasonality and it does matter.

11:19.440 --> 11:24.840
OK, so the game plan for today's call is we're going to go as follows.

11:24.840 --> 11:28.520
We're going to cover how the seasons affect this business.

11:29.560 --> 11:32.400
What what you need to think about before selecting your niche,

11:32.400 --> 11:35.000
which is going to be brief, because I've talked already about niches.

11:35.240 --> 11:38.560
We're going to talk about what to consider when selecting a city slash state.

11:38.560 --> 11:42.040
And then if you're not in a city slash state in the US, in your country,

11:42.040 --> 11:44.880
whatever city is in the country you're targeting, which, by the way,

11:44.880 --> 11:48.160
this does work in other countries, for those of you that are wondering about that question.

11:48.840 --> 11:52.160
We're going to talk about how to preemptively solve any problems

11:52.160 --> 11:55.600
with the business owner that would normally come as a result of seasonality.

11:56.000 --> 12:00.000
And then we're going to talk about how to make sure your contracts match the seasons.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.320
OK, and then if we have time, we're going to do some Q&A.

12:02.320 --> 12:05.680
So that said, guys, let's one more time, if you stay to the end,

12:05.680 --> 12:09.000
we're going to get you that digital resource because we appreciate you

12:09.000 --> 12:12.520
giving your time and I want you taking notes on the things that come to your mind.

12:12.840 --> 12:14.920
Not what I'm covering, because I'm going to give you the notes

12:14.920 --> 12:17.560
on what we're covering in the form of that digital resource if you stay to the end.

12:17.560 --> 12:20.040
OK, so let's talk first about

12:21.560 --> 12:24.440
how the seasons actually affect this business.

12:25.560 --> 12:30.440
This is a fact. OK, lead flow changes with the seasons.

12:31.040 --> 12:35.240
No matter what anyone tells you, no matter how much you want to pretend it doesn't.

12:35.680 --> 12:39.800
Leads are different in the spring than they are the week of Christmas.

12:40.040 --> 12:41.440
That's just a fact, right?

12:41.440 --> 12:44.240
Because of a million different reasons we're going to talk about today.

12:44.240 --> 12:47.680
But just so you know, leads are going to change.

12:47.680 --> 12:51.520
The flow of leads, the amount of leads that come in in specific niches

12:52.000 --> 12:56.160
does change with the seasons. OK, just so everybody knows.

12:57.040 --> 12:59.960
Another fact, OK, most home service

12:59.960 --> 13:04.840
businesses slow down during the holidays and during the winter,

13:04.840 --> 13:06.960
which is basically when it gets cold.

13:06.960 --> 13:09.480
Let me repeat that most home service businesses

13:09.720 --> 13:12.320
slow down during the holidays and when it gets cold.

13:12.320 --> 13:15.800
Now, obviously, there's going to be stuff in there that might be,

13:15.800 --> 13:17.920
you know, a little bit flipped, for example,

13:18.920 --> 13:23.600
when it goes from getting being really hot and your AC goes on to,

13:23.840 --> 13:26.920
you know, it starts to get cold and you kick on your heater.

13:26.920 --> 13:29.200
It starts to stink and smell.

13:29.200 --> 13:33.040
And then all of a sudden, oh, my gosh, I need to come and check my whatever my my

13:34.640 --> 13:37.560
what the heck is it called my not my thermostat, my unit

13:38.720 --> 13:43.440
that, you know, that little period of change is going to get going to give a spike.

13:43.920 --> 13:46.760
But just what you guys need to understand, the majority of the niches

13:46.760 --> 13:50.160
that we talk about that we target that I've made my money on the concretes,

13:50.160 --> 13:54.320
the tree service, the fencing, the the the epoxy.

13:54.320 --> 13:59.280
All of these things are negatively affected during Christmas

13:59.280 --> 14:01.920
and the cold when it gets cold.

14:02.040 --> 14:05.680
OK, again, if you're if it gets cold at a different time of the year than December,

14:06.160 --> 14:08.960
then you need to consider the fact that that might affect you twice,

14:08.960 --> 14:12.200
because no matter what, when it's holidays, people typically

14:12.200 --> 14:13.840
aren't doing stuff on their house.

14:13.840 --> 14:16.080
OK, that's just that's just really the case.

14:16.080 --> 14:20.000
OK, when the seasons change and I'm talking about, you know,

14:20.000 --> 14:23.440
when things start to get cold, when the holidays start to come up,

14:23.440 --> 14:25.160
you know, probably from Halloween.

14:25.160 --> 14:29.200
I know that's not really a holiday, but from October 31st until.

14:30.280 --> 14:32.320
Honestly, until after the New Year,

14:33.040 --> 14:36.480
definitely through January and then about mid February.

14:37.400 --> 14:42.400
People's desire to fix their houses is pretty much like going down,

14:42.800 --> 14:49.000
and it is the slowest from December 15th to December 31st.

14:49.640 --> 14:54.440
That is a fact, and I can prove that I could show you so many examples.

14:54.960 --> 14:59.200
People's desire to fix their homes, to do repairs,

14:59.200 --> 15:02.880
to add concrete to whatever on their houses,

15:03.480 --> 15:07.000
unless it's a complete emergency, like their tree is falling into their house.

15:07.440 --> 15:10.920
It is going to be the slowest from December 15th to December 31st.

15:10.960 --> 15:14.200
OK, and then for some weird reason at the first of the year,

15:14.200 --> 15:18.640
even though it's still bloody cold, people like have some,

15:18.640 --> 15:21.400
not all, but a lot of people, they have kind of like this like new,

15:21.600 --> 15:23.880
hey, we're going to get things tightened up and we're going to do this.

15:24.040 --> 15:26.120
That typically comes more during spring cleaning.

15:26.120 --> 15:29.280
But you will see a little bit of an increase during the first of the year.

15:29.880 --> 15:31.880
But I'm telling you, those last two weeks in December

15:31.880 --> 15:34.240
are the slowest time of the year. OK.

15:35.360 --> 15:37.560
I don't know other than the fact that when it's cold,

15:37.560 --> 15:39.320
I don't think people are in the mood. They're not thinking about it.

15:39.320 --> 15:42.240
But I also know that people are like they're out doing parties.

15:42.240 --> 15:43.480
They're having parties at their house.

15:43.480 --> 15:45.640
They're they're buying gifts for their kids.

15:45.640 --> 15:48.200
They're traveling for for the holidays.

15:48.200 --> 15:50.360
Money's not as expendable. Right.

15:51.640 --> 15:53.360
And that's just a fact. OK.

15:53.360 --> 15:57.960
Also note that like when the season starts to change from the cold

15:57.960 --> 16:03.360
back to the warm, the spring, the spring cleaning itch, people,

16:03.400 --> 16:04.680
there's a there's an uptick.

16:04.680 --> 16:07.440
There's a really nice uptick in Leeds.

16:07.440 --> 16:10.640
And hey, let's come in, you know, get our trees trimmed

16:10.920 --> 16:12.960
and get that taken care of. Let's throw in that fence.

16:13.160 --> 16:16.600
Let's get that artificial grass put in that we were talking about last fall.

16:16.840 --> 16:18.240
We don't want to put it in during the winter.

16:18.240 --> 16:18.960
Let's put it in.

16:18.960 --> 16:20.320
We're not even able to use it during the winter.

16:20.320 --> 16:22.240
Let's put it in now that the snow's starting to melt.

16:22.240 --> 16:25.480
Or if it doesn't snow now that it's starting to get warm, we can go out by the pool.

16:25.840 --> 16:27.560
Let's throw in that fire pit.

16:27.560 --> 16:29.920
Let's do that outdoor kitchen or whatever the case is.

16:30.280 --> 16:33.400
As the season starts to change to warmer weather

16:33.960 --> 16:37.680
based on the niches that we target and talk about basic home service niches,

16:37.680 --> 16:39.800
you are going to see an uptick. OK.

16:39.800 --> 16:42.680
And one of the things I want to add just as something to remember

16:43.640 --> 16:47.280
is there is a strong correlation.

16:47.280 --> 16:52.080
And I know this because I've I've heard people say it is when tax returns

16:52.080 --> 16:56.520
start to come back to people, you start to see an uptick as well.

16:56.600 --> 16:59.960
OK, people get their check, especially like obviously W-2.

16:59.960 --> 17:02.960
They go if you're on a W-2, you go and you submit your taxes

17:02.960 --> 17:05.080
and then you get your return, whatever.

17:05.440 --> 17:08.720
A lot of people take that money and they put it into fixing up their house.

17:09.080 --> 17:12.200
You know, pressure washing the the the entire house.

17:12.920 --> 17:16.880
Epoxying the garage, whatever the case is.

17:16.880 --> 17:19.400
And these are things that I have not just heard is or not.

17:19.400 --> 17:20.640
This isn't data points.

17:20.640 --> 17:23.080
This is from experience.

17:23.520 --> 17:27.040
I have seen it, guys, my first two years in business.

17:27.160 --> 17:29.160
OK, like actual because I did it the first year.

17:29.160 --> 17:31.000
I got sidetracked, whatever.

17:31.000 --> 17:35.320
So 2017, I would say my first three.

17:35.320 --> 17:36.520
Let me not even lie to you guys.

17:36.520 --> 17:40.400
My first three years, 17, I basically only had SEO clients

17:40.400 --> 17:43.080
because I was trying to like just make money to pay the bills.

17:43.080 --> 17:45.600
OK, because I was coming off the back end of a failed business.

17:46.080 --> 17:48.800
17, I was doing SEO because I just need to pay the bills.

17:48.800 --> 17:54.520
18 and 19, I got wrecked during the holidays.

17:54.520 --> 17:55.840
I got absolutely wrecked.

17:55.840 --> 17:58.000
And what happened to me is in 2018,

17:59.960 --> 18:01.600
the biggest time I got wrecked was in 19

18:01.600 --> 18:05.200
because 18 something happened that kind of like confused me.

18:05.200 --> 18:07.320
And I thought that, you know, I was safe.

18:07.600 --> 18:10.920
But the mistake that I made, guys, is and this is another reason

18:10.920 --> 18:12.440
I could sit here and talk about this all day long.

18:12.440 --> 18:15.400
But another one of the 50 reasons

18:15.400 --> 18:18.040
why you should be doing flat fee regeneration and not paper

18:18.040 --> 18:23.880
lead or commission deals or, you know, profit splitting is for me.

18:23.880 --> 18:26.680
What ended up happening is a lot of my deals were on paper

18:26.680 --> 18:28.600
lead back in 2018, 2019.

18:28.600 --> 18:32.280
I thought that was the holy grail of of how to structure this business.

18:32.280 --> 18:36.080
OK, and what ended up happening is I had like some pretty solid months,

18:36.080 --> 18:38.400
July, August, September, even October.

18:39.560 --> 18:42.720
And in 2018, November, go figure,

18:43.040 --> 18:45.520
was, I think, my biggest month of the year.

18:46.040 --> 18:49.520
And what had happened is I was in a specific industry

18:49.840 --> 18:52.200
that, you know, was affected by weather.

18:52.200 --> 18:54.400
And the industry was basement waterproofing.

18:54.400 --> 18:58.120
OK, and what happened is in October, I believe it was maybe September.

18:58.600 --> 19:03.520
I happen to have sites in states that got hit by hurricanes.

19:04.440 --> 19:06.360
Yeah, I think it's called hurricanes or typhoons.

19:06.360 --> 19:09.040
I think it's hurricanes anyway. Yeah.

19:09.040 --> 19:12.480
So what happened is September, October, these storms came in,

19:12.480 --> 19:17.000
completely wiped out houses and flooded basements and all this stuff.

19:17.360 --> 19:22.040
And so it took a while for the insurance people to come out

19:22.040 --> 19:24.680
and, you know, quote them whatever to clean up.

19:25.200 --> 19:28.080
And November was phenomenal for me.

19:28.080 --> 19:29.520
I mean, we had so many leads.

19:29.520 --> 19:32.240
And at the time, I was getting paid per lead.

19:32.280 --> 19:34.080
So I thought I'd figured out the game.

19:34.080 --> 19:35.680
Huge November.

19:35.680 --> 19:38.880
I'm trying to make my projections based on like October was good.

19:38.880 --> 19:40.640
September was good. October was better.

19:40.640 --> 19:42.080
November is amazing.

19:42.080 --> 19:44.160
And I'm like, dude, this is it's just going to get better.

19:44.680 --> 19:50.280
And then December 2018, we literally just completely craft the bet.

19:50.280 --> 19:53.120
I mean, our revenue went to like 25 percent

19:53.120 --> 19:56.040
because all of our deals, for the most part, were on paper lead.

19:56.640 --> 19:58.760
So if no leads come in, no revenue comes in.

19:58.760 --> 20:01.000
Imagine, right, like all of my employees I've got.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.520
I've got an office space.

20:02.520 --> 20:05.280
I've got, you know, vacation I've budgeted for.

20:05.280 --> 20:06.400
I got Christmas coming up.

20:06.400 --> 20:08.440
I've got all these different things I want to do.

20:08.440 --> 20:10.200
And I'm on a paper lead model.

20:10.200 --> 20:12.880
And all the leads that were good during November.

20:13.080 --> 20:15.400
Now people are pausing because it's the holidays.

20:15.400 --> 20:18.280
OK, even though they need to fix it, they're going to wait until the spring.

20:18.720 --> 20:22.360
And guys, I got absolutely wrecked that that December, like absolutely wrecked.

20:22.360 --> 20:25.840
I remember I was like nervous, like this is not good.

20:26.680 --> 20:28.240
I was worried about my business.

20:28.240 --> 20:29.760
I was worried about having to let people go.

20:29.760 --> 20:35.200
I was worried about the fact that I had a lease on a rent payment on an office.

20:35.200 --> 20:36.720
I was worried about buying.

20:36.720 --> 20:38.880
I mean, everything was terrible.

20:38.880 --> 20:41.520
It was just so terrible because I couldn't really control it.

20:41.520 --> 20:48.360
OK, and because I'm an idiot, the next year, 2019, I all of 2019,

20:48.360 --> 20:51.000
I continue to do paper lead for the most part.

20:51.480 --> 20:54.680
Hey, it's just I was like, yeah, it's just because the niche, right?

20:54.680 --> 20:56.760
It's just because I was in basement, waterproof and I need to go.

20:56.760 --> 20:58.840
So I did paper lead, but I did it in different niches.

20:58.840 --> 21:02.080
Started expanding into foundation repair and a few different things.

21:03.120 --> 21:06.680
Lo and behold, same exact thing happened to me in 2019.

21:06.920 --> 21:11.480
And this time it happened to me starting from end of October, November and December.

21:11.480 --> 21:15.280
So I had like a two and a half month just tank and it was bad.

21:15.680 --> 21:18.640
And if you guys remember my story, which I shared a little bit of at the beginning,

21:18.960 --> 21:22.800
2019, December was kind of my like, all right,

21:23.600 --> 21:26.360
draw a line in the sand or get out of this business, figure out,

21:26.360 --> 21:28.600
are you going to go all in on this or are you not going to go all in on this?

21:28.600 --> 21:30.720
But here's here's your moment.

21:30.720 --> 21:35.040
And so I want to go like the reason I'm harping on this today, guys,

21:35.040 --> 21:39.120
is because I have literally had some really depressing

21:39.840 --> 21:43.600
November, December's and enough that it

21:44.080 --> 21:46.920
it really, really made me like question this business model.

21:46.920 --> 21:50.120
And it wasn't because of the business model is because I was an idiot

21:50.360 --> 21:52.480
and I was structuring it incorrectly.

21:52.480 --> 21:56.440
So if you haven't heard any of my content or me talk about paper lead,

21:56.520 --> 21:59.480
go to YouTube, type in paper lead, Nick Wood, paper

21:59.480 --> 22:02.320
lead, digital real estate, whatever you're going to see my videos.

22:02.880 --> 22:06.240
I am not a fan of paper lead for those reasons. OK.

22:06.320 --> 22:11.120
So just so you guys know, there is seasonality to this business.

22:11.120 --> 22:15.640
You are going to continue to get leads throughout the year to some degree.

22:15.920 --> 22:20.640
Now, if you're in snow removal, probably going to get zero leads in July,

22:20.640 --> 22:22.640
except for maybe somebody looking for a job.

22:22.960 --> 22:25.800
But if you're in like just a regular service, tree service,

22:25.800 --> 22:30.240
concrete, spray foam insulation, artificial grass, fencing, masonry,

22:30.240 --> 22:32.720
you're going to get some leads during the slow time,

22:32.720 --> 22:34.800
but it's going to be drastically different. OK.

22:36.080 --> 22:39.240
So that is what I want to talk about in terms of like, just so you know,

22:39.440 --> 22:42.400
you need to be aware, you can pretend it's not the case.

22:42.400 --> 22:44.880
But the seasons do affect this business.

22:45.120 --> 22:46.640
They do affect this business.

22:46.640 --> 22:47.920
But I have a solution for you.

22:47.920 --> 22:49.800
I'm going to get you there in just a second. OK.

22:49.800 --> 22:53.600
You also want to talk about next is you guys need to consider this

22:53.600 --> 22:55.600
when you're selecting your niche. OK.

22:55.880 --> 23:00.360
So what I would recommend is just everything is going to be seasonal

23:00.360 --> 23:02.080
to some degree, no matter what.

23:02.080 --> 23:04.160
Everything is going to be some degree of seasonality.

23:04.480 --> 23:06.960
You know, concrete is going to be slower in December.

23:07.120 --> 23:08.000
That's just a fact.

23:08.000 --> 23:11.920
Concrete is going to be slower in November than it is in in in, you know, April.

23:11.920 --> 23:13.400
That's a fact.

23:13.400 --> 23:15.720
You're not going to be able to completely avoid seasonality.

23:16.720 --> 23:22.000
But what I would recommend is don't pick something that is the best

23:22.000 --> 23:25.960
or is good just during the winter like snow removal,

23:26.640 --> 23:29.280
like and by the way, I've done I didn't do snow removal

23:29.280 --> 23:31.960
because I was smart enough that snow removal didn't make sense to me.

23:31.960 --> 23:34.320
But I thought, you know what, it'd be interesting.

23:34.320 --> 23:36.720
I should do a website for Christmas lights.

23:37.880 --> 23:40.120
You know, Christmas light installation.

23:40.800 --> 23:42.640
And I did it.

23:42.640 --> 23:45.840
I can't remember if I even landed a deal

23:45.840 --> 23:48.040
or if I was just sending over so I did get leads.

23:48.040 --> 23:50.960
Of course, I built a site, got it right, got some leads.

23:51.120 --> 23:52.440
Might even have the website.

23:52.440 --> 23:53.880
In fact, let me check.

23:53.880 --> 23:55.880
Be hilarious if I do. Let me just go like this.

23:58.640 --> 24:01.040
I think I've got I told them to get rid of it because.

24:02.640 --> 24:03.720
It just didn't make sense.

24:03.720 --> 24:06.040
Let me see if I have this website still.

24:06.040 --> 24:10.160
Let's see. Hang tight, is that me?

24:11.080 --> 24:13.360
Oh, I do have it, huh?

24:13.360 --> 24:15.400
I do have it, and I am ranked.

24:16.520 --> 24:18.320
Number two, hilarious.

24:18.320 --> 24:19.960
I don't even know if we got any leads last year.

24:19.960 --> 24:23.400
I'm sure we did, but we don't even have a client for it.

24:23.400 --> 24:24.640
Like, it's just a website that's ranked.

24:24.640 --> 24:27.200
So I said not to get rid of it, I'm sure.

24:27.200 --> 24:31.120
Christmas lights is good in end of November.

24:31.120 --> 24:32.800
If you're in Utah, by the way,

24:32.800 --> 24:34.280
people start hanging Christmas lights

24:34.280 --> 24:35.720
the second the Thanksgiving's over.

24:35.720 --> 24:39.440
In fact, Thanksgiving weekend, end of November and December.

24:39.480 --> 24:41.760
That's it. After that, it's done.

24:42.080 --> 24:44.160
OK, now I know there's some permanent Christmas light

24:44.160 --> 24:46.280
businesses popping up, whatever.

24:46.280 --> 24:48.200
I think it looks tacky.

24:48.200 --> 24:50.280
Maybe it's just the company that's in my neighborhood.

24:50.280 --> 24:51.240
I don't like it.

24:52.600 --> 24:55.800
But I'm telling you guys, if you do Christmas lights,

24:55.800 --> 25:00.000
if you do snow removal, it's going to be good for like two months, three months.

25:00.000 --> 25:03.400
And then the rest of the year, there's no leads coming in.

25:03.400 --> 25:05.200
So you can't expect that person.

25:05.200 --> 25:07.000
It's going to be really tough to convince them, hey,

25:07.000 --> 25:09.520
you're going to pay me this amount through the whole year,

25:09.720 --> 25:11.400
but you're only going to get leads for two months.

25:11.400 --> 25:12.920
That's really, really difficult.

25:12.920 --> 25:16.880
So just my two cents.

25:17.400 --> 25:19.120
I'm not interested in those niches.

25:19.120 --> 25:21.800
I'm not interested in niches that are snow removal,

25:21.800 --> 25:23.960
Christmas lights, stuff that only makes sense

25:23.960 --> 25:26.600
during a very specific time of the year.

25:26.720 --> 25:28.920
So the niche does matter.

25:28.920 --> 25:33.000
Now, I'm not going to spend a ton of time because we've talked a lot about niches.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.480
But just so you're aware, I'm not a fan of those niches

25:35.480 --> 25:38.480
because there's not that much of a runway for you to get leads. OK.

25:40.160 --> 25:43.520
OK, let's talk really quick about what to consider when selecting a city.

25:44.560 --> 25:46.080
Just want to make, like I said before,

25:46.080 --> 25:49.000
every city in the world is going to be affected to some degree

25:49.000 --> 25:51.120
or another by seasonality.

25:51.120 --> 25:53.240
You cannot avoid it.

25:53.240 --> 25:55.960
But what I would just suggest really briefly on this topic

25:55.960 --> 25:58.720
is try to avoid cities where it is extreme.

25:59.280 --> 26:03.360
If there is extreme weather, I would avoid it because and it's not

26:03.360 --> 26:05.200
that it's not going to work. It's not that you.

26:05.200 --> 26:06.520
Oh, my gosh, I have a friend.

26:06.520 --> 26:08.600
He's got some websites in that and he's doing.

26:08.600 --> 26:10.240
That's great. It can work.

26:10.240 --> 26:15.240
But it comes back to like, why make it harder on yourself if you don't have to?

26:15.640 --> 26:18.160
If I can build for the same amount of money,

26:18.160 --> 26:22.880
I can build a concrete website in Naples, Florida,

26:23.320 --> 26:25.920
where the weather is moderate to good all year.

26:25.960 --> 26:28.160
Concrete can be poured all year.

26:28.160 --> 26:33.920
Or I could do it in Minneapolis, where it gets super cold.

26:33.920 --> 26:36.600
Or, you know, Sioux Falls.

26:36.880 --> 26:38.680
I think that's one of the Dakotas.

26:38.680 --> 26:41.080
I think that just came out of my mouth.

26:41.080 --> 26:45.080
Why on earth would I spend the same exact time

26:45.360 --> 26:47.880
when I could get the say I could I could spend the same time

26:47.880 --> 26:49.720
and have one that's going to be producing year round?

26:49.720 --> 26:52.000
It just it doesn't make sense.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.920
Now, if you live in Minneapolis,

26:55.600 --> 26:59.280
then you might have an argument, hey, I have contacts here and that's whatever.

26:59.280 --> 27:01.720
That's great. But if you're just living outside of these states,

27:02.080 --> 27:07.440
do not try and target extreme freaking cities in the same way that I recommend.

27:07.440 --> 27:09.600
I tell you guys, don't target California.

27:10.320 --> 27:12.400
You can. But why?

27:12.400 --> 27:14.240
Why are you making it harder on yourself?

27:14.240 --> 27:17.480
Like, let's do the easiest thing we can do.

27:17.480 --> 27:19.440
I'm lazy, guys. I'm going to be honest.

27:19.440 --> 27:22.880
I want to do the most bare minimum thing I can do and make the most amount of money.

27:22.880 --> 27:24.480
I'll put in the work.

27:24.480 --> 27:27.680
But sometimes because we're willing to do the hard work,

27:28.160 --> 27:31.520
we don't use our heads and we end up doing so much more work

27:31.520 --> 27:33.480
than we need to do to get the same result. Right.

27:33.800 --> 27:36.840
It's like I'm willing to go knock doors.

27:36.840 --> 27:38.920
I did it for four years. I made good money.

27:38.920 --> 27:40.360
I made a couple hundred grand a year.

27:40.400 --> 27:43.680
I mean, from eighty thousand dollars my lowest year to two hundred and ten

27:43.680 --> 27:46.680
thousand dollars in a four month, five month summer knocking doors.

27:46.680 --> 27:49.480
Yes, I'm willing to do the hard work.

27:49.480 --> 27:53.440
But then one day I was like, why the heck am I not using the Internet?

27:53.440 --> 27:56.560
Why the heck am I using my time and trading my time for dollars?

27:56.560 --> 27:58.680
Why don't I put the same energy and effort?

27:58.680 --> 28:01.960
It's going to be my same 40 hour, 60 hour, 100 hour week.

28:02.320 --> 28:05.240
Why don't I put it into something where I can use the Internet?

28:06.160 --> 28:10.200
And now I can go and get deals without having to knock on a door.

28:11.040 --> 28:13.240
And that's when I got into this. And guess what?

28:13.240 --> 28:16.480
I'm putting in actually less work than I was,

28:16.480 --> 28:21.920
way less mental and physical labor than I was when I was doing door knocking.

28:22.280 --> 28:25.320
And I'm making millions of dollars a year versus a couple hundred

28:25.320 --> 28:26.360
thousand dollars a year.

28:26.360 --> 28:28.920
That was guaranteed because I was good at it and knew what to do.

28:29.240 --> 28:30.960
But this I had leverage.

28:30.960 --> 28:34.600
And so my point being, guys, I've done it.

28:34.600 --> 28:37.600
I've tried the Dakotas. I've tried the Minnesotas.

28:37.600 --> 28:38.880
I've tried these extreme.

28:38.920 --> 28:40.320
I've tried the New York.

28:40.320 --> 28:42.120
I have a website in Rochester.

28:42.120 --> 28:43.800
I don't know if it's still a website, by the way.

28:43.800 --> 28:45.840
The reason I don't know why some of these are alive

28:45.840 --> 28:50.000
is because Francesca runs my agency, most most of my agency.

28:50.000 --> 28:51.760
We meet. She updates me.

28:51.760 --> 28:52.960
She gives I give her feedback.

28:52.960 --> 28:54.720
Here's what we should do. Here's where we should focus.

28:56.160 --> 28:57.600
Here's the guy that wants leads.

28:57.600 --> 28:58.560
But she runs it.

28:58.560 --> 29:00.240
I don't even know if we still have this website,

29:00.240 --> 29:02.960
but we got this deal one time in Rochester, New York.

29:03.120 --> 29:06.400
And I think we just targeted the area like idiots

29:06.680 --> 29:08.800
because I wasn't thinking about seasonality.

29:08.800 --> 29:11.840
And I think it was was it concrete, I believe.

29:12.720 --> 29:16.680
And I went did my process, built a one pager, ran ads, got leads.

29:16.680 --> 29:18.720
Boom, boom, boom. Sold somebody.

29:18.720 --> 29:20.760
OK, a thousand bucks a month at minimum.

29:20.760 --> 29:23.640
And I remember this because I very rarely do deals under a thousand.

29:23.640 --> 29:27.880
Got the deal. And lo and behold, as soon as it got cold,

29:28.320 --> 29:33.840
dudes calling me up, hey, we're we're not doing any more work until like January.

29:33.840 --> 29:34.760
And I was like, what do you mean?

29:34.760 --> 29:38.120
He's like, no, we actually like don't we don't we just don't even do it.

29:38.640 --> 29:41.000
We just shut it down from now.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.920
And he's like from about like he was like, whatever.

29:43.960 --> 29:44.720
I think it was October.

29:44.720 --> 29:50.360
It's like from mid November or end of November till February 15th.

29:50.400 --> 29:53.360
He's like, we don't offer the service like we're not.

29:53.480 --> 29:54.720
There's no work that happens.

29:54.720 --> 29:56.160
And I didn't even know this.

29:56.160 --> 29:57.800
I was like, you're joking.

29:57.800 --> 29:59.480
No, we don't do it.

29:59.480 --> 30:01.280
And so I there's nothing I could do.

30:01.280 --> 30:05.360
I just had to like say, all right, well, I guess we'll talk in in March.

30:05.720 --> 30:07.480
Right. And I've already built the website.

30:07.480 --> 30:08.400
I've already got the deal.

30:08.400 --> 30:09.560
I've already put the money into it.

30:09.760 --> 30:13.120
So I'm trying to get you guys to just not make these mistakes that I made.

30:13.160 --> 30:14.960
OK, there we go.

30:15.440 --> 30:16.960
OK, now this is the good stuff.

30:16.960 --> 30:18.040
This is the meat and potatoes.

30:18.040 --> 30:18.960
What I want to talk about today.

30:20.640 --> 30:22.280
There is always going to be seasonality.

30:22.280 --> 30:23.200
You're going to deal with it.

30:23.200 --> 30:24.520
It's part of the business.

30:24.520 --> 30:25.600
It's part of every business.

30:25.600 --> 30:26.520
I don't care what it is.

30:27.440 --> 30:29.000
Retail is the opposite.

30:29.000 --> 30:30.480
Right. Retail is the opposite.

30:30.480 --> 30:31.720
They love Christmas.

30:31.720 --> 30:33.760
Right. They love November, Black Friday,

30:34.200 --> 30:36.240
because that's when everyone's buying Christmas.

30:36.240 --> 30:38.960
Right. For us, we don't like Christmas because it's slow,

30:38.960 --> 30:41.560
which I actually do love Christmas because it's when I take the time

30:41.560 --> 30:44.840
to to put my foot on the gas and slash travel

30:44.840 --> 30:47.200
because it does get a little bit slower.

30:47.200 --> 30:49.720
But guys, this is the part I want to talk about, which is how to

30:50.040 --> 30:55.560
how to preemptively solve any potential issues with the business owner.

30:55.960 --> 30:59.120
Issues that normally would come as a result of seasonality.

30:59.880 --> 31:01.800
You and I'm going to say this first.

31:01.800 --> 31:03.120
I promise you they're going to come.

31:03.120 --> 31:04.280
These issues are going to arise.

31:04.280 --> 31:06.000
I don't care how cool your business owner is.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.720
I don't care how long you know each other.

31:07.720 --> 31:09.400
You guys went to high school.

31:09.400 --> 31:11.920
If your buddy's paying you a thousand bucks a month

31:11.920 --> 31:16.040
and you send him zero leads in November and December, it ain't going to fly.

31:16.040 --> 31:18.600
I don't care how. Again, I don't care if it's your brother.

31:18.720 --> 31:19.560
That might be different.

31:19.560 --> 31:21.800
Maybe your brother is allergic to money,

31:22.880 --> 31:24.800
but there is going to be an issue. OK.

31:24.800 --> 31:27.480
So you know there's going to be an issue.

31:27.480 --> 31:29.040
You know it's going to be a thing.

31:29.040 --> 31:32.960
So what I always say in terms of this, I cover this in depth

31:32.960 --> 31:34.560
inside of Digital Landlords.

31:34.560 --> 31:36.200
Anyone that's on this call, I know Lane is.

31:36.200 --> 31:37.600
He's inside Digital Landlords.

31:37.600 --> 31:42.440
I talk very much about, you know, a lot of people say eliminate objections.

31:42.680 --> 31:45.120
OK. I'm sorry. A lot of people say overcome objections.

31:45.120 --> 31:47.360
And I like to say eliminate objections.

31:47.360 --> 31:50.880
Overcoming an objection means that there's an objection that's presented.

31:50.880 --> 31:52.480
And now you need to overcome it.

31:52.480 --> 31:55.520
And what I found is that when you do that, you are on the defense

31:55.520 --> 31:58.240
and you waited until they've presented an objection.

31:58.440 --> 32:00.680
And now you have to overcome it. They voiced it.

32:00.680 --> 32:03.120
It's a thing. They made it a thing. Now you have to overcome it.

32:03.440 --> 32:09.400
On the flip side, if you know it's going to come and you bring it up first

32:09.400 --> 32:13.680
and we call this preemptive, preemptively overcoming objections,

32:14.000 --> 32:15.760
we bring it up first.

32:15.760 --> 32:17.760
It is so much easier. OK.

32:17.760 --> 32:20.200
And think about for those of you guys that have kids

32:20.200 --> 32:23.840
or those of you guys have nieces or nephews or siblings, whatever.

32:24.200 --> 32:27.640
It's like, for example, if you sit down and you're at dinner

32:27.640 --> 32:30.600
and you tell the kids, you're like, look, if you finish this meal,

32:30.600 --> 32:33.640
if you finish 10 bites, right, because with kids, it's bites

32:33.640 --> 32:35.640
because they don't finish anything that's healthy.

32:35.640 --> 32:38.080
If you will have five bites of your chicken,

32:38.560 --> 32:40.560
then you're going to be able to have ice cream.

32:40.560 --> 32:42.160
OK. And you just lay it out up front.

32:42.160 --> 32:43.960
As the food's getting put, you get five bites.

32:43.960 --> 32:45.680
You can have ice cream. OK.

32:45.680 --> 32:47.680
Now, they still might throw a fit. It still might be a thing.

32:47.680 --> 32:51.560
But compare that to when you just don't say anything.

32:51.560 --> 32:54.640
You put the food down, they start making whatever their style.

32:55.000 --> 32:58.080
And then somebody at the table is like, oh, do we have ice?

32:58.080 --> 32:59.280
What's for dessert?

32:59.280 --> 33:01.160
And the kid hears it. Ha ha.

33:01.160 --> 33:04.320
Good luck trying to convince them to have five bites, right?

33:04.560 --> 33:06.080
Because you didn't bring it up first.

33:06.080 --> 33:08.720
And now it's a thing. Now it's an actual thing.

33:08.800 --> 33:09.560
OK, that's one example.

33:09.560 --> 33:14.760
Another example I'll give you is when I started my digital

33:14.760 --> 33:19.720
landlords program back in 2021 December at that time, which, by the way,

33:19.720 --> 33:22.560
thank goodness, this has kind of gone away at that time.

33:22.560 --> 33:25.360
Google was really funny about suspending.

33:25.360 --> 33:26.720
This does happen still.

33:26.720 --> 33:28.960
And so I'll even say it on this call for those of you

33:28.960 --> 33:30.520
that aren't in there yet.

33:30.520 --> 33:36.520
Google was very fussy about suspending people on their accounts.

33:36.520 --> 33:38.800
And you would have to verify your account.

33:38.800 --> 33:41.560
They would spend your Google ad account for all kinds of different reasons.

33:41.880 --> 33:43.480
Credit card didn't match.

33:43.480 --> 33:45.080
You were too new to the gate.

33:45.080 --> 33:46.320
No one even knew the answer.

33:46.320 --> 33:49.160
OK, like everyone got suspended, including myself.

33:49.160 --> 33:51.800
It's like they updated this thing and everybody started getting suspended

33:52.000 --> 33:53.760
and everybody started freaking out.

33:53.760 --> 33:55.120
I figured out how to get out of it.

33:55.160 --> 33:59.320
And so I realized like there's a pretty damn good chance.

33:59.320 --> 34:02.040
And this isn't necessarily as much the case now.

34:02.040 --> 34:02.880
It's gotten a lot better.

34:02.880 --> 34:06.040
But it was then when I first started, almost everybody was getting

34:06.040 --> 34:08.040
suspended at some point.

34:08.040 --> 34:11.120
And so what I ended up doing, I took the same principle

34:11.120 --> 34:15.160
and I told Kyle when he started working with me and helping on board people,

34:15.160 --> 34:17.960
I said, every single time you talk about Google ads,

34:17.960 --> 34:22.040
I need you to let people know it's not an if, but it's a win.

34:22.240 --> 34:26.480
When your ad account gets suspended, here's what you're going to do.

34:26.880 --> 34:28.000
You're not going to freak out.

34:28.000 --> 34:29.840
You're going to reach out to this person and we're going to.

34:29.840 --> 34:31.800
Here's the steps. And it's going to take time.

34:31.800 --> 34:33.080
Sometimes it takes 24 hours.

34:33.080 --> 34:34.560
Sometimes it takes two weeks.

34:34.560 --> 34:37.600
You can't control it. It's just going to happen because it did.

34:37.600 --> 34:40.520
And that was like 80 percent of people were getting suspended, including me.

34:40.520 --> 34:42.920
I got suspended and it was kind of a pain, whatever.

34:42.920 --> 34:44.600
But I figured out how to get out of it.

34:44.600 --> 34:47.320
As soon as we started doing that, guess what happened?

34:47.760 --> 34:51.320
When people got the suspension, their posts, their messages went like,

34:51.320 --> 34:52.880
oh, finally got suspended.

34:54.200 --> 34:56.360
What's the next step? Or finally got suspended.

34:56.360 --> 34:57.880
What can anyone offer?

34:57.880 --> 35:00.440
Instead of, oh, my gosh, I got suspended, I got

35:01.760 --> 35:03.200
and just freaking out.

35:03.200 --> 35:06.360
If you bring it up first, it is not a thing.

35:06.360 --> 35:08.480
If you don't bring it up first, it is a thing.

35:08.480 --> 35:10.920
Last example I'll give you, because this is such an important thing.

35:10.920 --> 35:13.840
If there's if there's an objection that keeps coming up, OK,

35:14.600 --> 35:16.800
just start eliminating it.

35:16.800 --> 35:19.320
I don't care if it's price, if it's contract,

35:19.320 --> 35:21.920
if you keep seeing the same objection, start bringing it up.

35:22.800 --> 35:24.200
I used to be terrified of flying.

35:24.200 --> 35:26.480
I used to think that like I was going to die in an airplane crash.

35:26.760 --> 35:27.600
Who knows? Maybe I will.

35:27.600 --> 35:30.080
And honestly, I hope that I'm at least over a cool country,

35:30.320 --> 35:34.760
like in like a jungle somewhere, not just over like stupid, like, I don't know.

35:35.200 --> 35:39.000
Whatever was Lane said, frickin Joplin, Missouri.

35:39.120 --> 35:42.320
Imagine I'd much rather die in like some jungle where a predator could eat me.

35:42.640 --> 35:43.880
But I used to be terrified of flying.

35:43.880 --> 35:45.520
I thought that was going to be the end of my life.

35:45.520 --> 35:47.360
Whatever I thought about a lot.

35:47.360 --> 35:48.480
And it would freak me out.

35:48.480 --> 35:50.480
I swear to you, I had a couple of weird experiences

35:50.760 --> 35:52.640
where like we had some really bad turbulence.

35:52.640 --> 35:54.400
I'm like, dude, I'm going down.

35:54.400 --> 35:57.000
Maybe you can relate. Maybe not. OK.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.640
Some of you guys probably just have a few shots and you just sleep.

35:59.640 --> 36:00.640
And that's the solution.

36:01.920 --> 36:04.280
So anyway, this was the thing.

36:04.280 --> 36:06.000
Like it would like consume my mind.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.840
I would be like terrified, honestly, of upcoming flights.

36:09.440 --> 36:12.080
And I remember getting on one flight has come back from Africa

36:12.160 --> 36:14.000
and we were in New York

36:14.000 --> 36:17.040
and there was a huge storm that like shut down the airport.

36:17.040 --> 36:18.640
I was even more terrified.

36:18.640 --> 36:22.200
Also, the like four days before that, there was a flight in Ethiopia

36:22.200 --> 36:24.360
that like took off five minutes later, completely crashed.

36:24.360 --> 36:25.760
Everyone on board died.

36:25.760 --> 36:28.560
And by the way, it was the same exact plane as the one I was taking,

36:28.560 --> 36:30.480
because I checked and I was like, oh, that's perfect. OK.

36:31.560 --> 36:34.720
But this flight attendant or this pilot, I can't remember which one it was.

36:34.720 --> 36:35.560
They got on the intercom.

36:35.560 --> 36:37.760
They said, hey, look, we're in New York.

36:37.760 --> 36:38.880
There's a storm.

36:38.880 --> 36:42.120
You know, if we do a direct shot from New York to Vegas, there's a storm.

36:42.120 --> 36:43.160
It's it's going to be rough.

36:43.160 --> 36:44.480
So we're actually going to go down.

36:44.520 --> 36:46.400
I think we went all the way down to like

36:46.400 --> 36:48.520
Alabama or something to kind of go around the storm.

36:48.520 --> 36:50.800
He's like, and just so you know, at about this point,

36:51.160 --> 36:52.320
there is going to be turbulence.

36:52.320 --> 36:55.160
It's going to be bumpy because we're getting some drifts from the storm.

36:55.440 --> 36:56.600
That's completely normal.

36:56.600 --> 36:59.440
But we should be good by about whatever, Kansas.

36:59.440 --> 37:01.080
I don't remember if that's might be off.

37:01.080 --> 37:03.280
Maybe it's New Mexico.

37:03.280 --> 37:06.200
But he came on the intercom and he said this.

37:06.720 --> 37:08.520
And I was like, OK.

37:08.520 --> 37:12.520
And lo and behold, you know, I watched the map.

37:12.520 --> 37:14.760
We went down and there was some pretty

37:15.600 --> 37:18.520
like decent turbulence, like enough that it would have scared

37:18.520 --> 37:20.240
the living daylights out of me.

37:20.240 --> 37:23.800
But because he had brought it up first, I didn't think it was just like, OK,

37:23.800 --> 37:24.760
he told me it's going to happen.

37:24.760 --> 37:26.280
He didn't freak out.

37:26.280 --> 37:30.880
Whatever. And so the point is, guys, if you guys will start bringing up,

37:30.880 --> 37:32.480
this is the same for any kind of objection.

37:32.480 --> 37:34.960
But if you will start bringing up these objections,

37:35.120 --> 37:38.040
if you will start preemptively seeing the complaints

37:38.040 --> 37:40.120
and the objections of people bringing them up and just

37:41.120 --> 37:44.920
not waiting for them to get said to you, but you go to them,

37:46.240 --> 37:51.440
it's going to be so much easier for you to overcome

37:51.440 --> 37:55.160
or for you to still get the deal despite these things. OK.

37:55.400 --> 37:57.520
So here's an example of what I like to do.

37:57.520 --> 37:58.880
And I like to just bring it up.

37:58.880 --> 38:01.600
And typically I bring it up on my sales call.

38:01.720 --> 38:06.000
Now, this is part of my script that I have for those that are in digital

38:06.000 --> 38:09.800
landlords. So those of you that are in, you'll see this as part of the script.

38:09.800 --> 38:12.960
But this is one of the things that I'll say is, you know, near the end,

38:12.960 --> 38:16.160
when I'm getting ready to close, I'll be like, you know, it's flat fee, whatever.

38:16.400 --> 38:19.480
But just so you know, it's going to be completely transparent with you

38:19.760 --> 38:21.360
because sometimes they'll ask a question, right?

38:21.360 --> 38:24.720
Like, how many leads can we expect? Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

38:24.720 --> 38:26.080
And I'll say, look, Mr.

38:26.080 --> 38:27.840
Business Hunter, let me be completely transparent with you.

38:27.840 --> 38:31.600
There are going to be some months that are super slow, some some months

38:31.600 --> 38:33.640
and some weeks that we're going to get no leads.

38:33.640 --> 38:35.800
That's just the fact. Christmas.

38:35.800 --> 38:37.560
Just go ahead and don't expect any leads.

38:37.560 --> 38:41.080
Everyone is out drinking eggnog, whatever, spiked eggnog

38:41.080 --> 38:42.920
and spending their money on whatever.

38:42.920 --> 38:44.880
Like, just just go ahead and put it in your head.

38:44.880 --> 38:46.440
You're not going to get any leads. That's just Christmas.

38:46.440 --> 38:49.120
OK. And it's probably good timing because you're probably going to want to be

38:49.120 --> 38:51.080
with your family anyway. But that is the truth.

38:51.080 --> 38:52.720
It's going to be slow. OK.

38:52.720 --> 38:54.600
No one's thinking no disrespect.

38:54.600 --> 38:56.680
No one's thinking about putting up a fence during Christmas.

38:57.400 --> 38:58.800
Todd, OK.

38:58.800 --> 39:00.960
Not to say Todd's in here, but that's just a business on our example.

39:01.240 --> 39:05.200
And then I'll say, but there's also going to be some months

39:05.480 --> 39:08.560
that are going to be super busy like this.

39:08.760 --> 39:10.400
You know, when people start getting their tax returns,

39:10.400 --> 39:11.560
we're going to see a spike.

39:11.560 --> 39:14.400
When it starts to get warm, you're going to start to see a spike.

39:14.640 --> 39:16.920
But here's the deal. It's going to even out.

39:16.920 --> 39:20.280
I'm not going to come and charge you extra money because we have a huge spike

39:20.280 --> 39:23.400
in leads during tax returns or during the warm season or because of this

39:23.400 --> 39:24.960
weather or that weather.

39:24.960 --> 39:28.600
And on the flip side, you know, I'm not going to pause

39:28.600 --> 39:31.160
payments or lower the price when it gets a little bit slow.

39:31.160 --> 39:32.720
It all is going to even itself out.

39:32.720 --> 39:34.480
So as long as we're on the same page,

39:34.480 --> 39:37.120
I'm not going to do some kind of surge pricing like Uber does

39:37.400 --> 39:39.000
just because we have a huge influx.

39:39.000 --> 39:42.080
But you've got to be just just promise me you'll be patient with me

39:42.200 --> 39:44.320
and not call and complain when things get a little bit slow,

39:44.320 --> 39:47.560
because that's just going to be the case. OK, done.

39:47.800 --> 39:49.160
That's all you've got to say.

39:49.160 --> 39:49.840
Does that sound good, Mr.

39:49.840 --> 39:52.920
Winsor? And if guys, if you say this two to three minute thing,

39:53.760 --> 39:55.920
you are setting the expectation.

39:55.920 --> 39:58.840
It takes literally 30 seconds to three minutes.

39:58.840 --> 40:00.160
You could say that exact same thing.

40:00.160 --> 40:03.920
I just said you saying that up front, being very clear,

40:03.920 --> 40:05.720
very honest with them.

40:05.720 --> 40:09.040
It is going to save you so many phone calls, so much heartache,

40:09.200 --> 40:10.920
so many setbacks, so many.

40:10.920 --> 40:12.960
I got to resell the deal to this person.

40:12.960 --> 40:15.040
I got to find a new business owner.

40:15.040 --> 40:19.720
It will save you so much in terms of resources, time, energy, money, etc.

40:19.840 --> 40:23.640
If you don't, good luck, because you are going to get phone calls.

40:24.440 --> 40:26.520
It takes you 30 seconds to three minutes.

40:26.520 --> 40:29.680
If you do not, you are going to have a issue

40:30.240 --> 40:31.480
because it's going to happen.

40:31.480 --> 40:32.720
You're going to have things slow down.

40:32.760 --> 40:34.440
So why not just bring it up first?

40:34.440 --> 40:37.800
Now, for those of you that are on there like, oh, my gosh, I sold a business owner.

40:39.240 --> 40:42.000
I didn't bring it up. What do I do?

40:42.000 --> 40:45.360
Well, what you do is what I'm going to talk about

40:45.360 --> 40:48.840
in my very last section of this training when we're talking about contracts.

40:48.840 --> 40:54.400
But I just want to like emphasize to you guys that, you know, a lot of business,

40:54.400 --> 40:58.280
a lot of like relationships is setting and managing expectations.

40:59.280 --> 41:03.040
If a business owner is expecting that it's going to get slow in December.

41:04.360 --> 41:06.000
It's not going to be a big deal.

41:06.000 --> 41:09.560
If a business owner thinks it's going to be just great all year round.

41:11.880 --> 41:14.560
It's going to be a thing. It's going to be a real thing.

41:14.800 --> 41:18.280
You have to set the proper expectations and then manage those expectations.

41:18.280 --> 41:21.960
And the other thing that happens, guys, I know when you when I say that,

41:22.960 --> 41:25.280
you know, that line that I said, which is like, hey, just so you know,

41:25.280 --> 41:26.400
it's going to be slow during Christmas.

41:26.480 --> 41:32.000
I know in some of your minds, you might think that's going to hurt the deal.

41:32.920 --> 41:36.000
But, you know, it's actually going to do the opposite because you being honest,

41:36.000 --> 41:39.880
you, you know, painting this picture that's not 100 percent perfect

41:39.880 --> 41:44.040
and making it seem real is going to create more trust with you.

41:44.040 --> 41:48.560
And again, I've said this so many times, trust is the hardest objection to overcome.

41:49.280 --> 41:51.480
And no deal is perfect.

41:52.400 --> 41:55.040
No service is perfect. No business is perfect.

41:55.080 --> 41:57.440
And so if you paint this picture of everything's going to be perfect

41:57.440 --> 41:59.480
and the numbers are going to be great, you're going to make all this money.

42:00.160 --> 42:02.560
It's going to sound too good to be true because it probably is.

42:02.720 --> 42:06.000
So just know that when you say things like that and you don't just say,

42:06.000 --> 42:09.080
yeah, it's going to be great and blah, blah, blah, and it should just be fine.

42:09.600 --> 42:11.000
Just say it as it is, man.

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
It's probably going to be slow in the winter, dude.

42:13.000 --> 42:16.400
That's just the truth. You know, that's just how it is.

42:16.400 --> 42:19.920
So, you know, and if they start complaining, like, yeah, sure.

42:19.920 --> 42:22.720
If you want me to, you know, if you want me to lower the price

42:22.720 --> 42:23.720
during the winter, that's fine.

42:23.720 --> 42:26.400
But when I I'm going to also charge you extra

42:26.920 --> 42:31.360
when we start getting a surge in tax time and during the spring

42:31.520 --> 42:34.000
and during, you know, the storms that increase.

42:34.280 --> 42:36.320
So that's how I get around that.

42:36.320 --> 42:41.560
OK, so just so you guys know, that's all you have to do is those two to three minutes.

42:41.560 --> 42:43.600
Sometimes it can be 30 seconds.

42:43.600 --> 42:46.240
And that will save you so much time.

42:46.360 --> 42:49.480
OK, last thing I want to cover is how to make sure

42:49.480 --> 42:51.800
that your contracts actually match the seasons.

42:51.800 --> 42:55.440
OK, number one, I oh, by the way,

42:55.440 --> 42:58.760
I know people that have that are in this game that don't do contracts.

43:00.280 --> 43:02.600
And that's completely fine. That's their decision.

43:03.040 --> 43:05.000
Contracts make me sleep at night.

43:05.000 --> 43:07.440
Now, I have a whole thing.

43:07.440 --> 43:10.000
I could go on because I'm going to say it, but contracts make me sleep.

43:10.000 --> 43:13.880
And I have a contract on every single person I work with as much to set

43:13.880 --> 43:17.560
expectations, just like I just said, as much to set expectations

43:17.560 --> 43:21.400
as it is to actually legally bind them to the thing that we've agreed to.

43:21.400 --> 43:24.480
OK, so number one, I always do contracts.

43:24.480 --> 43:27.960
Number two, I always do a six month minimum contract if I can help.

43:27.960 --> 43:30.320
But there are situations I'll do three months. OK.

43:31.040 --> 43:35.400
But I also have a rule with contracts is I never let a contract expire

43:35.640 --> 43:40.240
in the winter. OK, so or as things are starting to dip.

43:40.240 --> 43:44.480
So I'm never going to let a contract expire in November, as it's probably

43:44.480 --> 43:47.760
going to be slower than October, which means we're going downhill.

43:47.760 --> 43:50.600
And then even if I sign them, it's going to be tough

43:50.600 --> 43:53.680
because then in December, it's just tough, guys.

43:53.680 --> 43:57.320
So I never let a contract expire during the slowdown

43:57.400 --> 44:00.480
or during the winter months. OK. Period. End of story.

44:01.280 --> 44:06.200
So what I'll do like right now, six months from now, it's it's July.

44:06.200 --> 44:08.520
This is putting us in like it's a perfect example.

44:09.080 --> 44:11.280
If we had a contract, right, that was six months.

44:11.280 --> 44:13.320
We're I think we're going to end in December.

44:13.320 --> 44:17.280
Like we're going to literally end December 29th, which is terrible.

44:17.600 --> 44:20.160
You're going to be in the in the worst two weeks of the year. OK.

44:20.320 --> 44:23.120
You're going to be trying to get them to sign a new contract

44:23.120 --> 44:26.200
coming off the worst month of the year, the slowest month of the year

44:26.200 --> 44:28.880
for most businesses. Good luck. It's going to be tough.

44:29.160 --> 44:31.200
It's going to be very, very it's going to be tough to even keep them,

44:31.200 --> 44:33.200
much less get them to sign a contract.

44:33.200 --> 44:40.880
So what I typically do is like from right now until we get to about October.

44:40.920 --> 44:44.560
So I'd say from now, August through the end of September,

44:44.560 --> 44:49.280
maybe even mid October, I am going to be selling a either a nine month

44:49.280 --> 44:51.520
contract or a three month contract.

44:51.640 --> 44:55.520
OK, because I would rather my contract go August, September, October

44:56.040 --> 44:59.880
ends in October and then I sign them for another six months or a year,

44:59.880 --> 45:05.000
ideally a year, or I go August, September, October, November,

45:05.000 --> 45:07.520
December, January, February, March, April.

45:07.880 --> 45:09.400
OK, that's nine months.

45:09.400 --> 45:14.160
I'd way rather my contract end in April after tax returns,

45:14.160 --> 45:17.040
spring cleaning is starting to get warm, etc.

45:17.600 --> 45:23.440
Then I would in November, December, January, February.

45:24.000 --> 45:27.120
Do not sign a contract that's going to expire in those months.

45:27.400 --> 45:30.360
November, December, January, February.

45:30.800 --> 45:34.120
Don't have to listen to me. Go test it. Good luck.

45:34.120 --> 45:36.680
Now, here's what I'll say to wrap this up.

45:38.120 --> 45:40.240
Those of you that have signed contracts didn't even think about it.

45:40.240 --> 45:42.160
You sign a six month contract, it's ending in December.

45:42.160 --> 45:43.720
Oh, my gosh, what am I going to do?

45:43.720 --> 45:49.200
Or you somehow signed one and then they wouldn't agree to an extension.

45:49.200 --> 45:52.320
So you're on a month to month or you signed an extension that puts

45:52.480 --> 45:55.040
and you just didn't even think about it. OK, here's what you do.

45:55.040 --> 45:57.920
This is what I do is once winter starts to approach.

45:58.160 --> 46:00.080
Usually for me, it's around like September.

46:00.080 --> 46:03.960
I'll do an audit on all my clients. OK, how happy are they?

46:04.200 --> 46:06.080
How many leads are we getting?

46:06.080 --> 46:09.600
How many are they closing? How generally speaking, one to ten?

46:09.600 --> 46:12.520
What's the health of the relationship? Is it is it a seven plus?

46:13.080 --> 46:16.240
OK, we might be OK. Eight plus, we're definitely OK.

46:16.360 --> 46:20.120
Anything less than a seven, then I'm going to take some action.

46:20.120 --> 46:22.120
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to make October

46:22.560 --> 46:26.080
end of September, maybe mid-September to mid-October.

46:26.080 --> 46:30.240
I'm going to make it the most amazing 30 days they've ever worked with me. OK.

46:30.520 --> 46:33.960
I am going to make sure that these guys remember who I am.

46:34.160 --> 46:35.440
They know where the leads are coming from.

46:35.440 --> 46:40.160
And I'll even go to the extent, guys, I'll go and I'll put on ads, you know,

46:40.720 --> 46:46.480
150 bucks to 250 dollars in ads to supplement these deals.

46:47.400 --> 46:49.560
Even if it puts me at a break even or a negative,

46:49.880 --> 46:54.520
I will do that to get them to have this amazing last month with me.

46:54.920 --> 46:57.800
And I will let them know like about two weeks out.

46:57.800 --> 47:00.960
I'll be like, hey, I want to discuss with you about, you know, working together.

47:00.960 --> 47:05.240
And I'll resign them into an agreement, even if my first one's not done yet.

47:05.640 --> 47:07.760
We'll say, hey, let's just end that one, sign a new one.

47:08.080 --> 47:10.720
I'll make sure they have the best 30 days of their life.

47:10.720 --> 47:12.680
And then I'll go pitch the agreement. OK.

47:12.880 --> 47:14.960
But if this is the reason I want to talk about this right now,

47:14.960 --> 47:18.440
even though it's just barely the end of, you know, July 1st of August,

47:18.800 --> 47:21.880
you guys have to start thinking about what kind of contracts you're selling

47:22.160 --> 47:25.360
and then how to handle the contracts that you have sold

47:25.640 --> 47:28.760
that are going to be putting you at a really bad time. OK.

47:29.200 --> 47:32.000
Guys, there's nothing wrong, by the way, with running 150 bucks,

47:32.000 --> 47:36.000
200 dollars, 250 bucks per month in ads for 30 days

47:36.200 --> 47:38.880
to sign another six month agreement for six thousand dollars

47:39.080 --> 47:41.360
at a 50 percent profit margin. That's three thousand dollars.

47:41.360 --> 47:43.120
You're spending two hundred and fifty.

47:43.120 --> 47:45.200
You're making three thousand net in your pocket.

47:45.200 --> 47:46.240
That's a 10 X return.

47:46.240 --> 47:49.080
It's not a bad use of money if I don't say.

47:49.080 --> 47:52.080
And I'm not a math genius, but that sounds like one dollar for ten.

47:52.080 --> 47:54.720
Sounds great. OK. You got to be strategic.

47:54.720 --> 47:56.240
These are all the guys.

47:56.240 --> 47:59.360
These are all the nuances. I never would have known this.

48:00.360 --> 48:02.080
I was never taught this.

48:02.080 --> 48:03.680
I was in all kinds of different programs.

48:03.680 --> 48:06.960
No one talked to me about what to do in the winter,

48:06.960 --> 48:10.440
what how to tee it up, how to get people, you know, juiced up

48:10.440 --> 48:11.240
so I could resign.

48:11.240 --> 48:14.320
And no one told me I for sure should do a contract. OK.

48:14.680 --> 48:17.600
And you guys can run the business you want the way that you want to run it.

48:17.600 --> 48:20.280
But again, the thing that I think you should consider

48:20.280 --> 48:23.240
is what I said at the beginning is that I don't give advice.

48:23.240 --> 48:25.280
I don't come on these calls unless I've done it.

48:25.680 --> 48:28.080
And I have lost a lot of money.

48:28.080 --> 48:30.800
I've had some very dark,

48:30.800 --> 48:34.200
some cold, dark nights in the winter.

48:34.520 --> 48:38.240
And I mean that in terms of physically because it's cold and it's dark.

48:38.240 --> 48:39.320
Early is December.

48:39.320 --> 48:42.640
And mentally, because I'm like, I don't know.

48:44.080 --> 48:47.400
When you are in the winter months and you are on paper lead

48:47.400 --> 48:51.120
or you just lost two clients and you only have four clients.

48:52.160 --> 48:54.440
It feels like like heavy, man.

48:54.440 --> 48:56.600
You're like, dude, is this business ever going to be good again?

48:56.600 --> 48:59.760
And then sure enough, by like end of February, March,

48:59.760 --> 49:02.560
things start to pick up, you start landing clients, people start calling you.

49:02.560 --> 49:04.240
Hey, let's talk about that deal.

49:04.240 --> 49:06.760
But it becomes very dark and it's very easy to give up.

49:06.760 --> 49:08.160
It's very easy to get sidetracked.

49:08.160 --> 49:11.840
It's very easy to start jumping to the next thing and having Chinese object syndrome.

49:11.840 --> 49:16.000
So we're talking about this at the beginning of August and end of July

49:16.000 --> 49:18.200
because it's coming up quick.

49:18.200 --> 49:21.040
And I want you guys, as you sell your deals,

49:21.400 --> 49:24.200
start selling deals right now to be thinking, hey,

49:24.200 --> 49:25.720
let's either do a three month or nine.

49:25.720 --> 49:27.480
I would prefer you guys do a nine month,

49:27.480 --> 49:30.120
but three months better than a six month right now,

49:30.120 --> 49:33.560
which I only would say because of the time of the year.

49:33.560 --> 49:36.160
And these are just things that you guys have to think about. OK.

49:36.480 --> 49:41.080
So imagine there is so much to this business that we've been able to talk about this.

49:41.400 --> 49:45.000
One thing, the seasonality of niches, which I have a million other things

49:45.000 --> 49:48.160
I could cover on this, but this is the overall the gist of this thing.

49:48.600 --> 49:51.080
This is this is what you need to know about the seasonality of niches.

49:51.080 --> 49:53.320
It does exist. It does affect everybody.

49:53.600 --> 49:58.760
And you need to do things to not have it affect you slash.

49:58.760 --> 50:02.680
If you have made mistakes, you need to do things to fight it

50:02.680 --> 50:06.320
and correct it and nip it in the bud before it becomes a problem. OK.

50:06.720 --> 50:08.880
Again, I'm just one person.

50:09.240 --> 50:13.720
However, I have been able to use this model to literally build my dream life.

50:13.720 --> 50:17.760
The the the exact thing that I wanted to do in 2016

50:17.760 --> 50:19.800
when I signed up for my first program.

50:19.800 --> 50:21.320
I remember they asked me like, what do you want?

50:21.320 --> 50:22.520
Why do you want to join this?

50:22.520 --> 50:23.920
What do you want to do?

50:23.920 --> 50:27.800
And all I could think like above the money, above whatever.

50:27.800 --> 50:29.240
There's two things.

50:29.480 --> 50:31.880
Number one, the idea of being able to get out of my bed,

50:32.360 --> 50:36.520
throw on a bathrobe and my slippers, walk into my office,

50:37.680 --> 50:40.840
sit down and make money without having to go out in the heat

50:40.840 --> 50:43.360
and make, you know, cold calls or cold knocks.

50:43.720 --> 50:45.880
That sounded beyond amazing.

50:45.880 --> 50:48.680
Like I couldn't even fathom that was a thing.

50:49.240 --> 50:51.080
And this is before everyone is making money online.

50:51.080 --> 50:53.040
I was like, how could what? That sounds amazing.

50:53.040 --> 50:55.640
I can do it from home and then I can be done and just go to the fridge

50:55.640 --> 50:57.720
and not have to have. It sounded amazing.

50:57.720 --> 51:00.840
Number two was being able to travel the world

51:01.320 --> 51:05.320
and make not just make enough, but make millions of dollars.

51:05.640 --> 51:07.600
I wanted to see the world. I wanted to see.

51:08.200 --> 51:09.920
I wanted to move to Africa.

51:09.920 --> 51:11.880
I wanted to. That was a place that was very important to me.

51:11.880 --> 51:13.120
I wanted to take my family there.

51:13.120 --> 51:15.000
I wanted to see different places.

51:15.000 --> 51:17.080
I wanted to go when it got cold.

51:17.080 --> 51:19.200
I didn't want to be anywhere near the cold.

51:19.200 --> 51:20.600
That was one of the things I didn't want to.

51:20.600 --> 51:22.080
I don't want to see snow for me.

51:22.080 --> 51:23.840
You guys, if you're skiers, that's cool.

51:23.840 --> 51:26.080
And that's your thing. I don't ever want to see the cold.

51:26.640 --> 51:29.720
And so it's it's been really, really fun.

51:29.720 --> 51:31.280
And just being able to do this.

51:31.280 --> 51:33.080
I'm in Dubai right now. If you guys didn't know this,

51:33.080 --> 51:34.440
I'm in Dubai right now.

51:34.440 --> 51:36.280
I've spent time in London. I spent time in Paris.

51:36.280 --> 51:37.360
I spent time in Africa.

51:38.800 --> 51:42.360
And it's only halfway through the year, I guess, eight months, seven months.

51:43.160 --> 51:45.400
But I'm just telling you guys this because

51:46.120 --> 51:48.360
I know some of you guys are sitting there stuck in a job,

51:48.600 --> 51:52.120
stuck in a nine to five or stuck in a business that you can't move

51:52.120 --> 51:54.040
because it's it's a business that is state.

51:54.040 --> 51:57.760
It's it's you have to be there in order for the business to run.

51:58.240 --> 52:01.160
And I'm just here to tell you guys that like it's man.

52:01.160 --> 52:04.880
I personally just think life's too short to not see this entire planet.

52:05.200 --> 52:08.320
If you're not going to travel, I think life's too short to have to be at work.

52:09.320 --> 52:11.360
I was talking to somebody about this yesterday,

52:11.360 --> 52:15.440
and I'm sure you guys have heard this, you know, a third of our life,

52:15.920 --> 52:19.120
a third of our life, statistically, is spent at work.

52:20.120 --> 52:23.480
A third. And I would assume another third spent sleeping.

52:23.480 --> 52:25.640
So a third of it spent at work, a third of it spent sleeping.

52:27.000 --> 52:29.120
And some of you guys hate what you do.

52:29.120 --> 52:30.560
And some of you guys maybe don't hate what you do,

52:30.560 --> 52:31.960
but you hate where you're doing it with.

52:31.960 --> 52:34.640
Some of you guys maybe don't hate what you're doing it with or what you do,

52:34.800 --> 52:37.320
but you hate, you know, the hours you have to do it.

52:38.080 --> 52:41.680
And so I guess it's like, dude, you have a vehicle right in front of you

52:42.160 --> 52:46.440
building simple assets, doing digital, building a digital real estate portfolio,

52:47.440 --> 52:50.080
getting passive income and living whatever life you want to live.

52:50.080 --> 52:51.600
If that means you want to be in Dubai, be in Dubai.

52:51.600 --> 52:55.800
If that means you want to be in freaking whoever, wherever, Kansas and,

52:55.800 --> 52:58.760
and, you know, hang out where you grew up.

52:58.800 --> 53:00.560
That's it doesn't do that.

53:00.560 --> 53:02.440
It's the best part. It doesn't matter.

53:02.440 --> 53:03.880
By the way, I don't know if that's where you grew up, Lane.

53:03.880 --> 53:07.480
I'm just that that no man's land, Kansas or Missouri thing.

53:07.480 --> 53:09.520
It's hilarious. It's up to you.

53:10.400 --> 53:13.480
You get to choose whatever life you want to live and go.

53:13.480 --> 53:15.560
And this business will fit around it.

53:15.560 --> 53:19.200
So I hope this was helpful for you guys.

53:19.760 --> 53:23.160
There wasn't a ton of time for quite for questions, so I didn't even bother today.

53:24.040 --> 53:26.160
But feel free to drop those inside of the Facebook group.

53:26.480 --> 53:29.400
We also just one last reminder, guys, is

53:30.080 --> 53:31.720
the digital resource we're going to create from this.

53:31.720 --> 53:33.880
We will send it out to all of you guys that are on this call.

53:35.000 --> 53:38.480
And yeah. And lastly, I've said this, if you guys haven't seen,

53:38.520 --> 53:41.280
I made a new welcome post inside of the group.

53:41.560 --> 53:44.680
But pay attention to what I'm doing, not just what I'm saying.

53:44.680 --> 53:46.600
Why do you guys think? Think about this.

53:46.600 --> 53:48.920
Why do you guys think I'm coming on and I'm doing these lives?

53:49.160 --> 53:51.560
Why do you think I'm this? You guys didn't pay me.

53:51.560 --> 53:53.520
I don't even know. Some of you guys don't even have your name on here.

53:53.520 --> 53:56.040
Got Discord user. Right. I don't know who you are.

53:56.480 --> 54:00.800
That's fine. But what I know is that if you guys are paying attention,

54:00.800 --> 54:04.240
you guys can see I'm using my same exact process

54:04.760 --> 54:06.920
that I teach inside of digital landlords.

54:07.320 --> 54:11.880
I am using it right now with you guys and I am giving you guys free leads.

54:12.680 --> 54:15.520
Free leads being you guys are interested in this model.

54:15.800 --> 54:18.200
You guys are interested in getting potentially getting involved.

54:18.400 --> 54:20.520
You guys are interested in potentially, you know,

54:20.520 --> 54:22.720
creating passive income with this model and doing this.

54:23.040 --> 54:25.800
And I'm like, hey, I don't you know, I'm here to earn your business.

54:25.800 --> 54:28.200
Of course, I'm not, you know, just a philanthropist.

54:28.720 --> 54:31.400
But let me you guys test this out.

54:31.400 --> 54:34.320
See what see what you think about some of my life, some of my trainings.

54:34.400 --> 54:36.200
Think about the stuff that I'm giving away for free.

54:36.960 --> 54:39.640
Think about what it's like to work with me on a paid level. OK.

54:40.120 --> 54:43.640
So I just want you to know that anything you see me do inside of my group,

54:43.800 --> 54:46.400
I want you to not just listen to what I'm saying, but pay attention to what I'm

54:46.400 --> 54:47.800
doing. Guys, appreciate you being on.

54:47.800 --> 54:52.120
We'll send you that resource and we will see you guys inside of the free group.

54:52.120 --> 54:53.560
Next week. I'm out.
