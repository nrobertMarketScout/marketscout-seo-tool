00:00.000 --> 00:16.920
All right, so the phone ain't ringing now what first of all if it's been 24 hours 12 hours

00:16.920 --> 00:21.860
Two days three days even four days and you're watching this video and going. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh

00:21.860 --> 00:25.180
Oh my gosh, stop turn off the video and wait a little longer

00:25.180 --> 00:32.700
Okay, but if it's been ten days or let's say say eight to ten days and nothing's happening. You're not getting any leads then

00:33.580 --> 00:36.300
Yeah, we let's dig in let's figure out what's going on

00:36.300 --> 00:40.100
So the first thing that we want to do is we got to figure out we got to diagnose the problem

00:40.100 --> 00:44.800
Okay, we're gonna figure out what is it that we're not getting? Okay, obviously, we're not getting leads

00:45.740 --> 00:50.940
But let's go back a little bit further. Let's see if it's deeper than that. Are we not getting leads? Okay, great

00:50.940 --> 00:52.940
So but are we getting clicks?

00:53.580 --> 00:58.500
Okay, so we're getting clicks but not leads so we can kind of look there. Are we getting impressions?

00:59.180 --> 01:01.660
Okay, so we're getting impressions, but not clicks

01:01.660 --> 01:05.060
So maybe it's there, you know, and we just start digging in layer by layer by layer

01:05.060 --> 01:09.160
But here is the key and this is very similar to when you're not closing deals

01:09.340 --> 01:14.020
You always want to look at the step or steps prior because that's where the issue is

01:14.020 --> 01:16.180
Okay, and so here's what you need to look at

01:16.180 --> 01:16.620
Okay

01:16.620 --> 01:21.980
If you are not getting and let me see if I can say this correctly if I if I don't say it correctly

01:21.980 --> 01:27.140
I will resay it and I'll tell you but I might mess this up

01:27.140 --> 01:32.020
Okay, but it just just hear me out. So if you are not getting leads

01:33.140 --> 01:40.380
But you're getting clicks. It's usually an issue with your landing page because think about it. People are clicking on your ads

01:40.380 --> 01:48.260
They're going to your page, but you're not converting them into calls. So it's usually a landing page issue. Okay now if you are getting

01:49.140 --> 01:50.180
impressions

01:50.180 --> 01:52.180
But you're not getting clicks

01:52.620 --> 01:58.820
It's usually an issue with your ad, right? Google is showing it to people they're putting it in front of people's faces

01:58.820 --> 02:03.060
That's the impressions but your ad copy is not grabbing them. And so that's why they're not

02:03.660 --> 02:08.840
Clicking on it. Okay, and so you just need to figure out like what is the issue?

02:09.300 --> 02:13.620
Because ultimately if we're not getting phone calls that is that's a problem

02:13.620 --> 02:14.940
That's that's what we need to figure out

02:14.940 --> 02:19.460
We want to go deeper and want to figure out what part of this we're actually

02:20.460 --> 02:26.620
Making a mistake. Okay, so that's number one is we're gonna diagnose where the issue is step two after you've diagnosed

02:27.140 --> 02:31.020
What part? Okay. Well, I'm getting impressions, but I'm not getting clicks or I'm getting clicks

02:31.020 --> 02:32.100
But I'm not getting calls

02:32.100 --> 02:34.180
What I want you to do is I want you to go and watch

02:34.440 --> 02:41.020
The video prior the video prior to this or the two prior to this or whatever video you need to watch that talks about

02:41.020 --> 02:44.100
That specific topic. So if you're having an issue with

02:44.940 --> 02:48.220
The landing page because you're getting clicks, but you're not getting calls

02:48.260 --> 02:51.380
You're gonna want to go and watch the module that talks about

02:52.300 --> 02:55.020
That building the landing page you're gonna talk. It's called money love speed

02:55.020 --> 02:57.380
That's the module you're gonna want to watch the infamous one pager

02:57.420 --> 03:00.200
Okay, if you're having a problem with some other area go watch that video

03:00.200 --> 03:02.200
So I want you to go and watch that video

03:02.620 --> 03:10.300
Whatever one it is and figure out is it something that you skipped whether on accident or on purpose because most often what I found

03:10.300 --> 03:14.180
Is that it's not because what we trained isn't working

03:14.180 --> 03:16.580
It's because you did something incorrect

03:16.580 --> 03:20.740
Maybe you set up the landing page and you thought you did everything correctly

03:20.860 --> 03:24.500
But you look at it and the phone number is nowhere to be found

03:24.500 --> 03:27.180
You had all the intention of the world of putting the phone number on there

03:27.180 --> 03:32.060
But it's just nowhere to be found or maybe it's right there, but it's not clickable or maybe it's clickable

03:32.060 --> 03:36.340
But it's not underlined. It's not highlighted and so no one's clicking on it. Maybe you didn't put the form

03:36.340 --> 03:39.100
Maybe the four like there's so many different variables

03:39.100 --> 03:46.500
I want you to go and rewatch that specific video that pertains to that step or covers that step and make sure you're doing it

03:47.340 --> 03:50.340
Exactly how it's trained in that video

03:50.340 --> 03:56.660
Okay, because until you do that we're not gonna be able to know and I'm telling you most often 99% of the time

03:57.220 --> 04:02.660
You're gonna figure out what you're doing wrong. You're gonna go. Let's say let's say you're getting impressions, but you're not getting clicks

04:02.660 --> 04:07.820
You're gonna go look at your ad copy and you're gonna go. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. I put I spelled the city wrong

04:07.900 --> 04:11.220
I put Queen Creek and I spelled it. I spelled Creek wrong

04:11.220 --> 04:15.620
I added an E and people are seeing it and they like oh my gosh, who's this incompetent business, right?

04:15.780 --> 04:21.100
So go first of all step one diagnosed step two go watch the video

04:21.420 --> 04:28.320
That talks about and trains on the part that you're messing up. Okay based on your diagnosis step three

04:28.500 --> 04:32.740
I'm gonna ask you to go into the Facebook community and

04:33.540 --> 04:35.420
Search the group okay

04:35.420 --> 04:40.380
I'm gonna have you search the group and look for conversations related to what you're having an issue with

04:40.380 --> 04:42.340
So if you're having an issue with your landing page

04:42.340 --> 04:49.460
I want you to go into this search bar at the very top corner a little magnifying glass and type click on it and type

04:49.820 --> 04:51.820
landing page one pager

04:55.300 --> 04:57.300
Whatever

04:57.580 --> 05:02.460
Weebly site or any keyword that you think people would type in when they're referring to

05:02.860 --> 05:08.820
The page that we eventually throw away the landing page that we use and then we eventually throw away and I want you to search for

05:09.100 --> 05:14.660
conversations around that and the reason I'm gonna direct you here instead of immediately just reaching out to fix it Felix or reaching

05:14.660 --> 05:19.140
Out to me or reaching out to somebody else is because guys I'm trying to turn you into entrepreneurs

05:19.140 --> 05:26.180
I'm trying to see how many millionaires I can create in this group and you just messaging me and me spoon-feeding you the answer

05:26.180 --> 05:32.820
First of all, it's not it doesn't work like mathematically. I don't have the time but number two. It's not teaching you anything

05:32.820 --> 05:36.580
Okay, I want you to be a problem solver. I want you to be able to go. Okay

05:37.100 --> 05:39.100
I diagnosed the issue. I

05:39.660 --> 05:45.540
Went and watched the video and now I'm gonna go search the group and search these conversations to see that see if I can figure

05:45.540 --> 05:50.220
It out on my own because what happens when you have this problem? It's 2 a.m. In the morning and everybody's asleep

05:50.220 --> 05:53.900
Okay, all right. You don't have the option to reach out to people

05:53.900 --> 06:00.500
Okay, I want you to be a problem solver. And so I'm first after you've diagnosed it after you've watched the video

06:00.500 --> 06:04.620
I want you to go and I want you to search the group and look for threads look for

06:04.980 --> 06:11.620
Conversations about the thing that you're struggling with whether it's the ad copy whether it's the one pager whether it's

06:12.100 --> 06:14.900
Setting up the ad properly get a location or whatever

06:15.020 --> 06:21.700
You've diagnosed as the issue number four the fourth thing that I want you to do is if you go in and you've done all

06:21.700 --> 06:26.340
These things you've diagnosed it. You've watched the video. You've searched the group. You've looked at the conversation

06:26.340 --> 06:29.100
You've responded to it and you're still stuck

06:29.700 --> 06:33.660
Go and make a post go and make a post. It says hey guys, I

06:34.500 --> 06:42.380
Have X amount of clicks and no leads and I've done this this this and this and I'm just not figuring this out

06:42.380 --> 06:47.640
Could somebody give me some insight and you're free to tag fix it Felix. Okay, you're free to tag me as well

06:48.000 --> 06:55.560
I'm just gonna be honest. I'll get to it as fast as I can but I am trying my best to use my time the best

06:56.320 --> 07:00.420
The best to benefit everybody. Okay, so tagging fix that Felix is gonna be your best option

07:00.420 --> 07:05.720
But go and make a post and be very thorough be very specific about it and ask people for help say hey

07:05.720 --> 07:09.440
Here's what's going on. I've done this this isn't this and I still can't figure it out

07:09.440 --> 07:12.960
Is there anybody that can help me and maybe what you can do is you can look and go?

07:13.080 --> 07:18.440
There's some of those threads some of those comments I looked at that was Jeff, you know Jeff was having that issue

07:18.440 --> 07:22.360
So maybe you go and you can tag Jeff, you know, yeah after you post it at Jeff

07:22.880 --> 07:26.320
Hey Jeff, I noticed you were having some similar issues. You have any insight on this

07:26.960 --> 07:31.000
Use your head and go and post. I'm telling you if you do those four steps and

07:31.920 --> 07:39.960
You again, this is I just should even go without saying but I'm gonna say it make sure that this isn't you just completely didn't skip

07:40.280 --> 07:46.400
Module one where I said don't go into these niches look out for this, you know, look out for that, etc

07:47.360 --> 07:52.960
Then you are going to figure this out some other things to take into account and they're easier to forget during the summer

07:52.960 --> 07:58.400
Which it's summer right now and I'm filming this in the winter. It's really easy is I also want you to think about the winter

07:58.400 --> 08:00.800
I want you to think about the the the weather right now

08:00.800 --> 08:03.840
I know in Australia and some other places winter is different different time of the year

08:03.840 --> 08:06.880
But think about it, right use your head go look at the forecast

08:06.880 --> 08:10.960
You're running concrete ads and it's December and and you're in Minneapolis

08:11.800 --> 08:13.800
Okay, first of all, you should probably shouldn't be in Minneapolis

08:14.480 --> 08:20.560
But let's say you are let's say for some weird reason that the due diligence works and it's a low-hanging fruit layup

08:22.040 --> 08:27.260
Guys who's searching for concrete who's even thinking about putting in concrete during Christmas?

08:27.260 --> 08:29.960
Nobody wants to go spend money on concrete during Christmas

08:29.960 --> 08:36.480
That's something you spend for most homeowners after they get their tax returns back when it's spring cleanup when people are getting back into

08:36.520 --> 08:41.320
Backyards and cleaning up the yard and do all those things use your head go look at the last 10 days weather

08:41.560 --> 08:47.440
Could that be affecting it? Is there a hurt? Are you in Florida and there's a damn hurricane? Okay

08:48.040 --> 08:54.680
Are you in Arkansas and there has been a tornado look at these different factors and also this is something to consider

08:54.680 --> 08:58.840
And I guess I I almost skip over this because it just makes sense in my head

08:58.840 --> 08:59.960
But don't look okay

08:59.960 --> 09:06.040
If this was in your city is there something that's happening in your city that there's probably not that many people searching that weekend

09:06.040 --> 09:10.280
Is it the Ironman that weekend go and use your head and look at those things?

09:10.280 --> 09:15.520
But if you use your head you've done the the the module one correctly you've picked the perfect niche

09:15.520 --> 09:20.520
You've you've found a layup and you've done those four things guys. We're gonna figure this out

09:20.520 --> 09:24.040
I promise you there's always a solution and we will figure this out

09:24.560 --> 09:26.560
That's it
