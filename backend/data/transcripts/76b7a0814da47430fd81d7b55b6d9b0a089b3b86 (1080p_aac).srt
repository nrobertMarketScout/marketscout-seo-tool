1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
By the way, guys, I am testing, just so everybody knows,

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,360
a little side note, I am testing stuff all the time,

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,760
testing Yelp, testing Bing.

4
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:07,600
For those of you that are like,

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,880
well, what happens if Google does this?

6
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,020
Guys, I don't care.

7
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,160
Guys, the strategy is sending leads up front.

8
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,140
The strategy is providing results in advance.

9
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,120
The technique we're using right now is Google Ads.

10
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,800
If that shifts, if that gets more expensive,

11
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,960
that whatever, great, we'll go find something else.

12
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,080
If you have a site that does not have,

13
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,440
that already has leads coming in consistently,

14
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,520
you can skip the ads part, right?

15
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,440
Because the ads is, it's the leads that we're trying to get.

16
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,480
So if you don't have the leads,

17
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,580
you need to do the ads to get the leads, to get the deal.

18
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,000
But if you already had the leads, you don't need the ads.

19
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,080
So technically, you could go to Facebook Marketplace

20
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,200
and pay a VA to go scrape Facebook Marketplace

21
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,040
and get a bunch of leads,

22
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,320
and you could use those to close the deals, right?

23
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,520
Technically, that'd be a technique, right?

24
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,760
Strategies results in advance.

25
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,040
So just quick side note B is, yeah, I agree.

26
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,360
It's stupid, Google, whatever.

27
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,480
I'm always testing stuff because, like, but I don't care.

28
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,960
If Google shifts and it doesn't work as well,

29
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:56,900
then we'll change.

30
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:57,820
I'm testing stuff right now

31
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,100
because I would like to find something

32
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,660
that works better, that's cheaper.

33
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,820
And I'm hoping there's something out there

34
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:02,660
and I'll keep testing.

35
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:04,220
And as soon as, as you guys know,

36
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:06,820
as soon as I figure it out, I'll give it to you, okay?
