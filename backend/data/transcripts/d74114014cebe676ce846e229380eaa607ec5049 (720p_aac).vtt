WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
So here's what we're going to do, I'm going to pull up my notes, guys.

00:06.000 --> 00:11.720
We are going to, we want to make sure these calls are very, like, we make, these are smaller

00:11.720 --> 00:14.560
sessions, they're more intimate sessions.

00:14.560 --> 00:15.560
We do that on purpose.

00:15.560 --> 00:22.600
We want to deliver like a more intimate experience and only let certain people on these calls

00:22.600 --> 00:23.640
that are serious.

00:23.640 --> 00:26.360
And so welcome to the call.

00:26.360 --> 00:30.360
We wouldn't have like sent you the link if we didn't think you were serious.

00:30.360 --> 00:32.800
And obviously you had to jump through a couple of hoops to get here.

00:32.800 --> 00:36.800
So one of the things that we are going to require though, is if you want to stay on

00:36.800 --> 00:38.400
the call, you need to get your camera on.

00:38.400 --> 00:42.840
The reason why we do that is because we want the people that are on this call to be paying

00:42.840 --> 00:43.840
attention.

00:43.840 --> 00:48.040
So put your camera on, we'll give you a few minutes in case you're laying in bed, which

00:48.040 --> 00:51.360
by the way, if you're in bed and you want to keep staying in bed, we don't mind, but

00:51.360 --> 00:52.840
if it's up to you.

00:52.840 --> 00:56.760
So in order to stand this call in the next five minutes, get your camera on.

00:56.760 --> 01:00.160
The reason being is we want people paying attention.

01:00.160 --> 01:04.320
And if we just wanted a bunch of numbers, we would just put the link in the Facebook

01:04.320 --> 01:05.320
group.

01:05.320 --> 01:08.560
But we want to see your faces, we want to be able to interact, et cetera.

01:08.560 --> 01:12.680
So that said, Aaron, you know what to do, we've got five minutes.

01:12.680 --> 01:18.800
At the end of this call, those people that are still on the call, we're going to screenshot

01:19.000 --> 01:26.120
and we will be putting together a, this one, because it's an interview, it's not necessarily

01:26.120 --> 01:29.520
like a presentation or a training.

01:29.520 --> 01:32.000
We are, we're probably going to just send out the replay.

01:32.000 --> 01:37.320
So we'll probably be sending the replay itself to everybody that's on this call at the end

01:37.320 --> 01:41.320
and we'll stick a screenshot and we'll get you that replay.

01:41.320 --> 01:42.520
So but just as a heads up.

01:42.520 --> 01:43.520
Okay.

01:43.520 --> 01:44.520
I just want to pull up my notes really quick.

01:44.520 --> 01:46.440
Did I miss anything, Aaron?

01:46.440 --> 01:47.440
Sounds good to go.

01:47.440 --> 01:48.440
Okay.

01:49.080 --> 01:50.080
That's beautiful.

01:50.080 --> 01:51.080
I just want to make sure I didn't forget anything.

01:51.080 --> 01:52.080
Pull up my notes.

01:52.080 --> 01:53.080
So yeah, guys, we'll give you a couple of minutes.

01:53.080 --> 01:54.080
Get your cameras on.

01:54.080 --> 01:55.480
You can keep it on mute.

01:55.480 --> 01:56.480
We don't care.

01:56.480 --> 01:57.480
We don't care if you're in bed.

01:57.480 --> 01:58.480
We don't care if you're mowing the lawn.

01:58.480 --> 01:59.920
We just want to see your faces.

01:59.920 --> 02:01.680
We want to see what we're talking to.

02:01.680 --> 02:03.160
And yeah, let's go from there.

02:03.160 --> 02:08.320
I did see one comment popping up said that they spied the Alabama hat.

02:08.320 --> 02:09.360
Yes.

02:09.360 --> 02:12.280
And by the way, if it's like, that's why my voice is gone.

02:12.280 --> 02:16.960
I went to the game on Saturday and it got crazy.

02:16.960 --> 02:19.320
So I lost my voice.

02:19.320 --> 02:22.120
So I apologize for that, but I'm not sick.

02:22.120 --> 02:23.200
I feel great.

02:23.200 --> 02:25.400
I just lost my voice at the game.

02:25.400 --> 02:28.080
That's when you know the game is good, by the way.

02:28.080 --> 02:29.080
Okay.

02:29.080 --> 02:33.000
So guys, today, welcome to the call.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.280
We've got Mike V on this call.

02:35.280 --> 02:42.120
And before we get into the interview, I want to just let you guys know that I don't I

02:42.160 --> 02:44.200
I never want to say that you should believe me.

02:44.200 --> 02:47.520
I never want to say that you should just take my my word for anything.

02:47.520 --> 02:51.160
And I want I want that to be the same case for anybody in the free group.

02:51.160 --> 02:57.160
OK, I see a lot of people at this really irritates me, by the way.

02:57.160 --> 02:59.120
Aaron knows this. Jason knows this.

02:59.120 --> 03:01.600
I'm sure Mike senses this.

03:01.600 --> 03:04.920
But when I see people in the group offering advice,

03:04.920 --> 03:10.280
it drives me nuts because 99 percent of the time, those people aren't even making money.

03:10.320 --> 03:14.840
Right. And I see people just raising their hand, saying,

03:14.840 --> 03:19.720
yeah, send me your free landing page or send me your free script or whatever.

03:19.720 --> 03:23.000
And guys, we don't take a second to think,

03:23.000 --> 03:25.240
does this person even know what they're talking about?

03:25.240 --> 03:28.640
And this is such an overused example, but I'm going to use it.

03:28.640 --> 03:32.520
That's like literally having somebody randomly in the group.

03:32.520 --> 03:37.120
Let's say we're in a fitness group and somebody randomly offers to say,

03:37.120 --> 03:40.800
it says, hey, I want to give you guys my workout plan and my diet,

03:40.800 --> 03:43.600
my workout routine and my diet plan.

03:43.600 --> 03:46.400
Who wants it? Right. And everyone raising their hand.

03:46.400 --> 03:50.680
And no one was saying, hey, let's see a picture and see if you're actually in shape.

03:50.680 --> 03:52.840
Right. That's how crazy it is.

03:52.840 --> 03:59.400
And so I this Aaron, am I wrong or is this the first interview that we've done on these calls

03:59.400 --> 04:01.040
since we changed the format?

04:01.040 --> 04:02.960
First one. First one.

04:02.960 --> 04:06.800
I don't let people like in all the history of our group.

04:06.800 --> 04:13.000
I think that we like unless I've I know for a fact that they've made money,

04:13.000 --> 04:15.400
I don't think that we've ever let anyone on a call.

04:15.400 --> 04:17.320
And I'm 100% sure of that.

04:17.320 --> 04:20.320
Unless they've made money doing this, we've never let them on a call.

04:20.320 --> 04:24.960
And we've never let somebody back twice unless they're making like real money.

04:24.960 --> 04:28.400
So that said, guys, I think you guys know my story.

04:28.400 --> 04:34.320
2016, I started and I'm saying this for the one or two people maybe that don't know.

04:34.320 --> 04:36.680
Eight years ago, I started doing this business model.

04:36.680 --> 04:40.560
Knew nothing about the Internet, knew nothing about online, was making my money,

04:40.560 --> 04:45.680
doing door to door sales, and basically was just looking for a way to make money,

04:45.680 --> 04:51.720
travel, be able to travel, be able to provide for my family, be able to have experiences

04:51.720 --> 04:55.360
and start buying real estate, all these different things.

04:55.360 --> 04:58.720
And I was looking for a model that had certain elements, passive.

04:58.720 --> 05:00.920
It was it was passive in nature.

05:00.920 --> 05:03.840
It was recurring. It was asset based.

05:03.840 --> 05:05.080
It was Internet based.

05:05.080 --> 05:07.480
It was scalable, da da da da da.

05:07.480 --> 05:09.000
And this is the one that I landed on.

05:09.000 --> 05:13.920
And I still, after all these years, have not found one that beats this or even comes close to this.

05:13.920 --> 05:17.200
So in 2020, we did our first seven figures.

05:17.200 --> 05:19.520
2021, we did another seven figures.

05:19.520 --> 05:24.600
And then in 2021, December 1st, we officially launched Digital Landlords,

05:24.600 --> 05:27.520
which is when we started training people how to do this.

05:27.520 --> 05:33.080
Mike V being one of the people that came through our program, as well as Aaron, as well as Jason.

05:33.080 --> 05:34.360
And that is the story.

05:34.360 --> 05:41.520
So just to give you guys a little bit of context so that for those of you that don't know who I am or know much of the story,

05:41.520 --> 05:46.160
I wouldn't be sitting here talking to you and I wouldn't feel right about talking to you if I hadn't made millions of dollars doing this.

05:46.160 --> 05:55.640
OK, so the reason I brought Mike V on and I'm going to have him share his story a bit is Mike V is doing $40,000 per month

05:55.640 --> 05:57.160
doing this business model.

05:57.160 --> 06:01.480
And, Mike, that's US or that's New Zealand dollars?

06:01.480 --> 06:03.200
That's big boy dollars.

06:03.200 --> 06:04.080
Thank you. I love that.

06:04.120 --> 06:04.840
Big boy dollars.

06:04.840 --> 06:05.840
And I knew the answer to that.

06:05.840 --> 06:07.040
I just wanted you to confirm that.

06:09.040 --> 06:12.320
So the guy is 40,000 times 12.

06:12.320 --> 06:13.840
That's almost half a million bucks.

06:13.840 --> 06:20.280
Obviously, it's not all profit, but just just to give you an idea of what's possible, that's what's possible.

06:20.280 --> 06:28.640
So I'm going to today we're going to be interviewing Mike and I want you guys to like we're going to save a good amount of time for Q&A.

06:28.640 --> 06:35.680
This is somebody who is like a grassroots born like made from from the ground up.

06:35.680 --> 06:40.440
He started doing this not that long ago, and he's at $40,000 per month.

06:40.440 --> 06:49.560
And and he's also living a very interesting and really quite inspiring life with what he's doing.

06:49.560 --> 06:51.080
So I'm excited to get into it.

06:51.080 --> 06:52.600
So, Mike V, welcome to the call, brother.

06:54.200 --> 06:55.120
Just having me on again.

06:55.120 --> 06:56.920
Good to catch up.

06:56.920 --> 06:57.760
I appreciate it, man.

06:58.120 --> 07:03.200
I've hit him up a few times recently because he's he's it's such a cool story that I wanted to share it.

07:03.200 --> 07:07.520
So we did have an interview a few weeks ago in digital landlords.

07:07.520 --> 07:10.960
It was it was really popular with tons of people on the call.

07:10.960 --> 07:12.280
A lot of people want to hear what you have to say.

07:12.280 --> 07:19.880
So I'm excited. So today I want to go like, you know, Mike, we've talked before and we've shared like some of the higher level stuff.

07:19.880 --> 07:25.040
I really want to go to like I think I'm looking at the audience here, some of these names.

07:25.080 --> 07:29.840
There are one or two people that are in the in the digital landlords group, which welcome guys.

07:29.840 --> 07:33.080
I see like Hill, he's he just barely joined.

07:33.080 --> 07:39.560
But a lot of these folks are still just kind of like looking at the model, poking around, et cetera.

07:39.560 --> 07:45.840
So we're going to talk about like more of the basics and why you decide to get into the model and some tips and that kind of stuff.

07:45.840 --> 07:52.720
But before that, I want you to just share your just kind of like your two to five minute story of, you know,

07:52.720 --> 07:58.440
where you started and how you got to where you're at right now, because I know there's a lot of people on here that don't know your story.

07:58.440 --> 08:04.400
So let's start with that, man. And tell people where you're at, by the way, right now and where you're from as well.

08:04.400 --> 08:13.560
Yes, we are. So I'm originally from Auckland, New Zealand, currently based in Thailand, just south of Bangkok.

08:13.560 --> 08:21.320
But I mean, to keep it fairly short, about seven years ago, I went to Bali just on like a break after I finished uni.

08:21.320 --> 08:25.040
And I was like, this is so cool here. Like, you know, why can't I just stay in Bali?

08:25.040 --> 08:30.520
Like, why do I have to go home and get a job and go back to the kind of into the system and all that?

08:30.520 --> 08:36.360
And since that moment, I was just trying to figure out how I could make enough money to go back.

08:36.360 --> 08:43.480
So I got back and I basically did corporate marketing, like sitting at a desk, working a nine to five for about five years.

08:43.480 --> 08:50.040
And I was trying to figure out all the side hustle stuff after work and in the weekends.

08:50.040 --> 08:58.280
And I was making about a thousand bucks a month for like four years, which looking back is like this crazy to think about.

08:58.280 --> 09:04.600
But and yeah, I was doing a bit of local regeneration, like some builders and stuff.

09:04.600 --> 09:08.240
And I was like, hey, I'm pretty good at this stuff. You know, I just need to get more clients.

09:08.240 --> 09:11.520
And it just never really happened. I didn't really know how to get more clients.

09:11.520 --> 09:15.960
And that's when I came across what you're doing with the rank and rent.

09:16.000 --> 09:22.360
I was like, this is so cool. I can just do the same thing, like get leads for these builder type companies.

09:22.360 --> 09:27.880
But I own all of the all of the properties. And, you know, it's me.

09:27.880 --> 09:31.680
You don't have to catch up with the monthly meetings like you just.

09:31.680 --> 09:37.480
You just as long as you're getting them the leads, you're providing the value and you can just get paid and it just gives you so much freedom.

09:37.480 --> 09:41.680
Like, as long as the client's phones are ringing, then mine are not.

09:41.680 --> 09:51.920
So I was pretty sold on what Nick was up to, consumed all of the free YouTube videos and then eventually joined.

09:51.920 --> 10:01.000
And when I joined on, I was on about thousand dollars a month and I actually had a ticket booked to go to Thailand in four months.

10:01.000 --> 10:05.600
I was like, you know, I'm just going to book this ticket and make it happen, like whatever happens happens.

10:05.600 --> 10:11.440
And, you know, thankfully, I joined this program and found out about digital landlords.

10:11.440 --> 10:14.240
And within eight weeks, I was on eight thousand a month.

10:14.240 --> 10:18.320
So it took me four years to four years making a thousand bucks a month.

10:18.320 --> 10:22.040
And then within eight weeks of joining Nick's program, I was on eight thousand.

10:22.040 --> 10:30.560
Just couldn't believe it, really. And since then, I had the best years of my life, personal growth, travel,

10:30.560 --> 10:35.240
you know, and then obviously scaled up to forty thousand a month as well while still traveling.

10:35.240 --> 10:42.520
And I've only got one contractor. So, yeah, that's the that's the story.

10:42.520 --> 10:45.520
So you only have I'm going to jump in that last part.

10:45.520 --> 10:49.600
So you only when you say you only have one contractor, what do you mean by that?

10:49.600 --> 10:54.560
I just got one guy who does on my blog post for the SEO sites.

10:54.560 --> 10:59.640
You're you're at forty thousand a month, you and one person.

10:59.640 --> 11:04.160
Yeah, the contractor. Yeah, that's crazy, brother.

11:04.200 --> 11:08.600
That is absolutely insane. OK, so I want to I want to go.

11:08.600 --> 11:11.680
And I had a few questions as you were throughout the story.

11:11.680 --> 11:16.560
And some of these are a little bit just curiosity because I've I've heard your story

11:16.560 --> 11:20.800
and I want to dig in a little bit. And some of them are more on the tactical side.

11:20.800 --> 11:24.920
So why what was it? I think this happens to a lot of us.

11:24.920 --> 11:32.120
Like we we have an experience, maybe it's a trip, maybe it's a interaction, a conversation.

11:32.120 --> 11:35.840
What about Bali was so I'm just curious,

11:35.840 --> 11:38.640
what about it was so attractive to you when you went?

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
I think it was the main thing was the freedom, like.

11:45.320 --> 11:48.480
I just remember having my scooter being actually in Lombok,

11:48.480 --> 11:50.720
which is a much more quiet island.

11:50.720 --> 11:54.840
Bali's very busy now, but I remember that moment of just like pure peace and like freedom

11:54.840 --> 11:59.920
and just not knowing that I had to wake up to an alarm tomorrow or like answer to anyone.

12:00.920 --> 12:03.120
And since that moment, I've just.

12:04.360 --> 12:07.920
That's just been my mission to to have that freedom whenever I want.

12:08.040 --> 12:12.480
And it's yeah, it's so so so grateful to have that like today.

12:12.480 --> 12:15.480
I honestly felt really tired from traveling the last couple of weeks.

12:15.480 --> 12:20.880
And I just did nothing, you know, just some just some basic stuff and try again tomorrow.

12:20.880 --> 12:25.560
But if I was at a nine to five, I'd have to get up and like grind and go through hell and back.

12:26.560 --> 12:31.200
It's it's crazy, because every single person on this call,

12:31.680 --> 12:38.640
every single one of us, including me, if I if I so wished is like we could do whatever,

12:38.640 --> 12:41.080
like we could change our entire situation.

12:41.080 --> 12:46.320
Right. And I think that we we hear stories like Mike's, your stories like mine.

12:46.320 --> 12:47.960
And they're like, they make you feel good.

12:47.960 --> 12:50.520
They inspire you. But we just think it's not for us.

12:50.520 --> 12:54.560
You know, like, man, it would be so cool if we could move to Bali.

12:54.560 --> 12:58.360
And just set up shop and ride scooters all day and make forty thousand a month.

12:58.360 --> 13:02.280
It sounds fake. It sounds like, oh, that's that's what you read about in the four hour

13:02.280 --> 13:04.960
work week kind of thing. But truly, truly like.

13:05.760 --> 13:07.280
Any one of us could do it, man.

13:07.280 --> 13:11.960
So my question for you is, if you guys didn't catch this part of his story,

13:11.960 --> 13:16.280
Mike went to Bali, he went back like in Bali, he's like, I'm coming back.

13:16.680 --> 13:19.680
You went back and at some point you said, I'm just going to book a ticket.

13:19.680 --> 13:23.560
And I'm basically forcing myself to go back to Bali.

13:23.560 --> 13:26.920
I'm basically forcing myself to make it happen by this date.

13:27.280 --> 13:32.560
Right. So how did you have the confidence to know that you could pull it off?

13:32.560 --> 13:36.560
Because you you hadn't done you've done a little bit of like stuff on your own,

13:36.560 --> 13:38.760
but you hadn't made the kind of money you needed to make.

13:39.560 --> 13:41.360
What gave you the confidence to do that?

13:43.360 --> 13:47.560
I don't really have any confidence that I was shutting myself leading up to leaving.

13:49.360 --> 13:51.560
So when I booked the ticket, I was making a thousand dollars a month.

13:51.960 --> 13:56.480
And that was probably enough to just have like three small meals

13:57.160 --> 14:01.760
staying like a really shitty backpackers, you know, that was probably enough to

14:02.480 --> 14:05.360
have freedom, no luxury or anything.

14:05.360 --> 14:09.880
But I didn't really have any confidence doing it.

14:10.160 --> 14:13.120
I was just turning 30 and I was reading a lot of like stoicism

14:13.760 --> 14:18.560
about like Memento Mori and, you know, the shortness of life and everything.

14:18.560 --> 14:20.160
And I was like, hey, I just I just have to do this.

14:22.080 --> 14:23.480
What were you reading? Meditations?

14:23.480 --> 14:26.680
Is that like the main one you're reading or some other ones as well?

14:28.080 --> 14:29.880
Yeah, I was reading meditations.

14:29.880 --> 14:32.760
I also read a Seneca book on the shortness of life.

14:32.760 --> 14:34.840
That's a really good book.

14:35.840 --> 14:37.840
Definitely recommend that one. That's a bit more about

14:39.680 --> 14:42.760
Seneca, just like observing a lot of the people in Rome at the time

14:42.760 --> 14:45.720
and how they were like squandering their time, he said.

14:45.720 --> 14:48.960
He says so that that that definitely helped me.

14:49.200 --> 14:52.040
I had some urgency to just to book the ticket.

14:53.440 --> 14:56.000
Seneca, the shortness of life on the shortness of life.

14:58.200 --> 15:00.200
Interesting. I just I typed it in, I want to look it up.

15:00.200 --> 15:04.080
So and basically in that book, it was talking about how the Romans

15:04.440 --> 15:07.320
were just squandering their life and he was observing this and going,

15:07.320 --> 15:10.760
what am I doing? And that's I mean, what's the premise of that?

15:13.040 --> 15:15.840
It was just observing like all the royals and the people that.

15:16.840 --> 15:19.480
You know, lots of lots of money, but they were

15:20.800 --> 15:22.200
always kind of like waiting for the future,

15:22.200 --> 15:26.240
like living in the future, not in the moment and living in expectancy

15:26.240 --> 15:29.280
and talking about when they do reach like the older years,

15:29.280 --> 15:33.040
that all of a sudden they just have this not regret, but like,

15:33.800 --> 15:36.160
sure, I need I need to go do all this stuff.

15:36.840 --> 15:38.880
So when you're reading that, you kind of just internalize it.

15:38.880 --> 15:42.120
And even at 30, I still feel quite old,

15:42.760 --> 15:46.280
especially with some of the guys that I meet in Thailand

15:46.280 --> 15:48.120
at a lot younger who made the jump earlier.

15:48.120 --> 15:49.560
So I just wish that I did it sooner.

15:52.680 --> 15:59.360
Yeah, I hold you 30, 30, 30, 31, 31, nearly 32.

15:59.680 --> 16:01.680
OK, so we're I'm 33.

16:01.680 --> 16:06.200
So I can relate. I feel when you're 30, when you're 20,

16:06.200 --> 16:09.800
you think 30 is like you're dead because you think it's old when you're 30.

16:10.440 --> 16:14.680
I've never I feel like I feel like when I looked at people that were 30,

16:14.680 --> 16:17.800
I feel way younger than how I viewed people that were 30.

16:17.800 --> 16:21.160
So so I know exactly what you're saying, man. So

16:23.480 --> 16:25.200
for those people that are

16:25.200 --> 16:28.760
let's just I don't know exactly, but maybe there is.

16:28.760 --> 16:30.880
Maybe there will be some replays that we send out to some people

16:30.880 --> 16:34.320
that are like, quote unquote, older that aren't in their 20s.

16:34.320 --> 16:37.320
Do you think that anybody can do this?

16:37.320 --> 16:40.320
And I don't need you to give me a real

16:40.320 --> 16:42.920
an answer that you think I'm looking for, but do you think it's possible

16:42.920 --> 16:46.720
that anybody can start this business and make money?

16:46.720 --> 16:50.320
Or do you think that there are certain people that cannot?

16:50.320 --> 16:54.320
And again, this is just pure based on what you think.

16:57.320 --> 17:00.320
I think you know, I can tell you that I'm not going to be able to do this.

17:00.320 --> 17:01.320
What you think?

17:03.320 --> 17:06.320
I think anyone can follow the training and

17:06.320 --> 17:09.320
you know, a monkey, a monkey could follow the training,

17:09.320 --> 17:13.320
like, to be honest, the way you've laid everything out in the course is

17:13.320 --> 17:17.320
it is extremely simple, like looking back, it's

17:17.320 --> 17:20.320
it's just so simple.

17:20.320 --> 17:23.320
I don't think everybody has the like the desire

17:23.320 --> 17:26.320
or the mindset to

17:26.320 --> 17:29.320
to go through the tough parts, especially when you're trying

17:29.320 --> 17:30.320
to get your first deal.

17:32.320 --> 17:33.320
Yeah.

17:35.320 --> 17:38.320
You know, my opinion on it, sorry, I was going to give

17:38.320 --> 17:41.320
I'm going to give Aaron cohost really quick

17:41.320 --> 17:44.320
because he so he can control the

17:44.320 --> 17:47.320
volume and stuff. Aaron, did you get the cohost

17:47.320 --> 17:50.320
real quick? Yes. OK, beautiful.

17:50.320 --> 17:53.320
My opinion is that anyone can do it,

17:53.320 --> 17:56.320
but

17:56.320 --> 17:59.320
the people like there are certain people that like have a

17:59.320 --> 18:02.320
proclivity that are going to do better because they're more,

18:02.320 --> 18:05.320
you know, they have more risk tolerance

18:05.320 --> 18:09.320
or they have, you know, more

18:09.320 --> 18:12.320
hunger or whatever. So, yeah, I'm with you, man.

18:12.320 --> 18:15.320
I think anybody on this call, if you guys will

18:15.320 --> 18:18.320
follow the training or the recipe

18:18.320 --> 18:21.320
that's been laid out, which is like do this, do this, do this.

18:21.320 --> 18:24.320
Anybody could do it. And it's funny

18:24.320 --> 18:27.320
because I was having this conversation just yesterday on my flight

18:27.320 --> 18:28.320
home with my dad.

18:29.320 --> 18:32.320
He was asking me this. He's like, so, you know,

18:32.320 --> 18:35.320
there's a specific person that he knew had just

18:35.320 --> 18:38.320
joined my program and he knows this person. He's like, so how

18:38.320 --> 18:41.320
do you think he's going to do? And I said, well, I

18:41.320 --> 18:44.320
said he can do as good as he wants to. I like he's

18:44.320 --> 18:47.320
like, so you think he can actually make good money? And I said, yeah,

18:47.320 --> 18:50.320
I said I gave him some examples

18:50.320 --> 18:53.320
and I'm going to give you guys the same examples. Guys, we have people

18:53.320 --> 18:56.320
that have speech impediments that

18:56.320 --> 18:59.320
are making fifteen, twenty thousand a month. We have people that have

18:59.320 --> 19:02.320
health problems. We have people with accents, which and I'm

19:02.320 --> 19:05.320
giving you guys examples of things that people think are

19:05.320 --> 19:08.320
impediments to their

19:08.320 --> 19:11.320
success or that are supposed to keep them from their success.

19:11.320 --> 19:14.320
We have people that are in other

19:14.320 --> 19:17.320
countries. We have people that

19:17.320 --> 19:20.320
I'm trying to give you single moms, single dads,

19:20.320 --> 19:23.320
people in college that are young, people that are

19:23.320 --> 19:26.320
in their later years that are quote unquote

19:26.320 --> 19:29.320
old. We have everything in between

19:29.320 --> 19:32.320
college kids. We have all sorts

19:32.320 --> 19:35.320
of different types. So, yes, I truly believe anybody can do it, but

19:35.320 --> 19:38.320
it just comes down to the freaking like the will

19:38.320 --> 19:41.320
to do it. And that's it. And so, Mike,

19:41.320 --> 19:44.320
you're at forty thousand a month. There's people

19:44.320 --> 19:47.320
that have been in the free group.

19:47.320 --> 19:50.320
Some of them, I could see their names, still don't have a

19:50.320 --> 19:53.320
deal. Heck, there's some

19:53.320 --> 19:56.320
like, let's be honest, there are people that have even

19:56.320 --> 19:59.320
gotten to the Digital Landlords program.

19:59.320 --> 20:02.320
They got in and decided not to do anything with it that aren't making

20:02.320 --> 20:05.320
money because they're not taking action. What's the

20:05.320 --> 20:08.320
difference between you and people that are not making any money? Like,

20:08.320 --> 20:11.320
how are you at forty K? Why are they not?

20:11.320 --> 20:14.320
Are you more talented? Are you more special?

20:15.320 --> 20:18.320
I mean, I started, I started off my career

20:18.320 --> 20:21.320
walking in the mud, doing landscaping and excavations.

20:21.320 --> 20:24.320
I think the formula

20:24.320 --> 20:27.320
or the system, because I think there's

20:27.320 --> 20:30.320
a formula and system for everything, is just having

20:30.320 --> 20:33.320
the desire and the mindset. So I think that's

20:33.320 --> 20:36.320
what I really had, if I look back,

20:36.320 --> 20:39.320
was the mindset

20:39.320 --> 20:42.320
and sorry, the desire. And I definitely got the mindset from

20:42.320 --> 20:45.320
the book recommendations that you made in the

20:45.320 --> 20:48.320
landlords. You know, once you sign up for the program,

20:48.320 --> 20:51.320
you're committed, right? You're committed financially

20:51.320 --> 20:54.320
and it's a lot easier to take action when you've made a

20:54.320 --> 20:57.320
commitment. So I read the Think and Grow Rich book

20:57.320 --> 21:00.320
back to front, you know, the first week standing

21:00.320 --> 21:03.320
in the mirror there, reciting, you know,

21:03.320 --> 21:06.320
how much you're going to make.

21:08.320 --> 21:11.320
Yeah, so the desire mindset and

21:11.320 --> 21:14.320
there's one last part I think I forgot.

21:16.320 --> 21:19.320
I think everything kind of happens from that.

21:19.320 --> 21:22.320
I was very focused, like, oh, sorry, yeah,

21:22.320 --> 21:25.320
it was taking a risk, like a committed risk.

21:25.320 --> 21:28.320
Like, if I joined landlords and didn't have that ticket book,

21:28.320 --> 21:31.320
then things may have looked a little bit different.

21:31.320 --> 21:34.320
But, you know, if you've got a family or something and you're not,

21:34.320 --> 21:37.320
you kind of like book a flight or something, then

21:37.320 --> 21:40.320
I think it's just equally important to have that desire, whether that's taking your

21:40.320 --> 21:43.320
your kids to school. Like I look at Ryan Dalton and

21:43.320 --> 21:46.320
digital landlords, you know, he's someone I really look up to.

21:46.320 --> 21:49.320
You know, he's into like martial arts,

21:49.320 --> 21:52.320
stuff like that, digital, grand congruent, but he's also got

21:52.320 --> 21:55.320
kids and like a family. So, you know, to see the

21:55.320 --> 21:58.320
to see what he can provide his kids, whether it's like personal training for

21:58.320 --> 22:01.320
jujitsu or education, you know, I'm sure that's

22:01.320 --> 22:04.320
one of his desires to have a nice family home with a dog.

22:04.320 --> 22:07.320
Just getting locked in on that desire and then

22:07.320 --> 22:10.320
following the book recommendation and landlords would be my

22:10.320 --> 22:13.320
recommendation.

22:13.320 --> 22:16.320
OK, why did you choose?

22:16.320 --> 22:19.320
So you said that you were doing some lead generation before

22:19.320 --> 22:22.320
you started doing rank and rent specifically, right?

22:22.320 --> 22:25.320
What kind of lead generation were you doing?

22:25.320 --> 22:28.320
I was building WordPress websites

22:28.320 --> 22:31.320
for local builders and running some ads

22:31.320 --> 22:34.320
and some SEO.

22:34.320 --> 22:37.320
And were you doing that on someone's recommendation

22:37.320 --> 22:40.320
or did you just stumble into it?

22:40.320 --> 22:43.320
I was at my nine to five corporate

22:43.320 --> 22:46.320
stuff learning a bit about marketing and then

22:46.320 --> 22:49.320
I was trying to do free stuff. I remember

22:49.320 --> 22:52.320
I did a couple of free websites back in the day, one for a

22:52.320 --> 22:55.320
a lash extension company, one for a

22:55.320 --> 22:58.320
homegrown honey one.

22:58.320 --> 23:01.320
And then I think two years later when I was still making basically

23:01.320 --> 23:04.320
nothing, I met a guy at a party who had a building company

23:04.320 --> 23:07.320
and he's like, hey, I just want to grow my

23:07.320 --> 23:10.320
building company. So I just did some free stuff for him

23:10.320 --> 23:13.320
and got some good results. So for the next

23:13.320 --> 23:16.320
two years, I think I've got one or two more clients like

23:16.320 --> 23:19.320
in terms of like a long term client.

23:19.320 --> 23:22.320
They didn't really grow, but I was kind of decent at

23:22.320 --> 23:25.320
getting the leads. I just didn't have

23:25.320 --> 23:28.320
the system or the vehicle to land more clients

23:28.320 --> 23:31.320
and get clients. And obviously cold calling is a big part of the

23:31.320 --> 23:34.320
digital landlords, the pre-selling.

23:34.320 --> 23:37.320
Why did you choose

23:37.320 --> 23:40.320
like instead of doing

23:40.320 --> 23:43.320
one of the other models, why

23:43.320 --> 23:46.320
why didn't you choose to do

23:46.320 --> 23:49.320
you know, copywriting or

23:49.320 --> 23:52.320
an SEO agency or

23:52.320 --> 23:55.320
drop shipping, whatever, insert

23:55.320 --> 23:58.320
whatever business model. What made you decide

23:58.320 --> 24:01.320
and I'm asking this because maybe there's

24:01.320 --> 24:04.320
somebody on this call that's like, you know,

24:04.320 --> 24:07.320
number one, in order for you guys to make money at this, you have

24:07.320 --> 24:10.320
to number one, there's a couple different things you have to believe.

24:10.320 --> 24:13.320
Number one is you have to have

24:13.320 --> 24:16.320
made up your mind that you have to do

24:16.320 --> 24:19.320
something, right? Meaning you have to start something

24:19.320 --> 24:22.320
on the side or you have to replace what you're currently doing.

24:22.320 --> 24:25.320
So sometimes I'll get on calls with people.

24:25.320 --> 24:28.320
This is back when I used to be the person that would sell people

24:28.320 --> 24:31.320
into digital landlords. They'd get on a call with me and the first question

24:31.320 --> 24:34.320
I would ask them is, are you

24:34.320 --> 24:37.320
like, do you really believe, do you have the desire to do

24:37.320 --> 24:40.320
something, period? Or are you still deciding

24:40.320 --> 24:43.320
whether you should do something or not? And what I mean by that

24:43.320 --> 24:46.320
is like once in a while I'll get somebody on the call and they'd be

24:46.320 --> 24:49.320
like, yeah, I'm trying to decide if I should

24:49.320 --> 24:52.320
start doing, if I should do something, right? And so guys,

24:52.320 --> 24:55.320
if you're not sold, if you don't realize

24:55.320 --> 24:58.320
that you need to do something, that's step one, right?

24:58.320 --> 25:01.320
And I hope that the fact that you're on this call

25:01.320 --> 25:04.320
is enough that like you know you need to do something.

25:04.320 --> 25:07.320
I'm assuming if you're on this call on a Monday morning, if you're

25:07.320 --> 25:10.320
in the U.S. or maybe a Monday evening if you're not

25:10.320 --> 25:13.320
in Asia, that you know you need to do

25:13.320 --> 25:16.320
something. That's step one. Step two is you need to realize

25:16.320 --> 25:20.320
or you need to pick what do I need to do, right?

25:20.320 --> 25:23.320
And there's a lot of things you could do. You could do drop shipping.

25:23.320 --> 25:26.320
You could do copywriting. You could do SEO. You could build websites.

25:26.320 --> 25:29.320
You could do social media

25:29.320 --> 25:32.320
management. You could do

25:32.320 --> 25:35.320
what other business models? A TikTok

25:35.320 --> 25:38.320
shop. What else

25:38.320 --> 25:41.320
am I missing? What's that?

25:41.320 --> 25:44.320
Coaching, remote sales, affiliate marketing.

25:44.320 --> 25:47.320
Right. These are all online things.

25:47.320 --> 25:50.320
Affiliate marketing, blogging. There's a

25:50.320 --> 25:53.320
thousand different things. And so the next step you guys need to

25:53.320 --> 25:56.320
decide is what am I going to use? And you

25:56.320 --> 25:59.320
used a really important word. You said you didn't know like

25:59.320 --> 26:02.320
the vehicle. So for

26:02.320 --> 26:05.320
you, what was the reason that this vehicle,

26:05.320 --> 26:08.320
what was the number one thing? I know that like there's so many

26:08.320 --> 26:11.320
things for me that make this vehicle

26:11.320 --> 26:14.320
and just to make it simple, we'll call it

26:14.320 --> 26:17.320
website rental or building and renting

26:17.320 --> 26:20.320
simple websites. Why was it that this

26:20.320 --> 26:23.320
model was so attractive? What was the number one most attractive

26:23.320 --> 26:26.320
part of this specific model?

26:26.320 --> 26:29.320
I was watching one of your YouTube videos

26:29.320 --> 26:32.320
and it just really clicked in my head like, hold on a minute,

26:32.320 --> 26:35.320
like I own like the website.

26:35.320 --> 26:38.320
So I've got the power

26:38.320 --> 26:41.320
here. You know, all the other guys that I've done a bit of like

26:41.320 --> 26:44.320
SEO and Google Ads for, I'm building up their business,

26:44.320 --> 26:47.320
building up their stuff. And if they cancel, like it's over.

26:47.320 --> 26:50.320
You know, you'll rank a guy number one in SEO and it's like, hey man,

26:50.320 --> 26:53.320
I'm going to cancel because I've got so many leads coming through.

26:53.320 --> 26:56.320
Whereas this

26:56.320 --> 26:59.320
and also the dynamic, it's not the usual agency client

26:59.320 --> 27:02.320
dynamic where you're getting on monthly calls

27:02.320 --> 27:05.320
like supplicating and telling them what you've got planned

27:05.320 --> 27:08.320
for the next month. It's like, here's your leads,

27:08.320 --> 27:11.320
you know, pay me my retainer. I'm going to make sure you're good

27:11.320 --> 27:14.320
and you just leave me alone because I can go back to

27:14.320 --> 27:17.320
jumping on the scooter and doing what I want.

27:17.320 --> 27:20.320
I love the thought of Mike V

27:20.320 --> 27:23.320
on a scooter around

27:23.320 --> 27:26.320
Thailand. It's just, it's a good thought. I like that,

27:26.320 --> 27:29.320
dude. I like that a lot. There's actually a Duke, we're on a Ducati

27:29.320 --> 27:32.320
1100 CC a couple of weeks back.

27:32.320 --> 27:35.320
But originally we started on the 50 CC scooter in Bali

27:35.320 --> 27:38.320
and we've upgraded to the Ducati.

27:38.320 --> 27:41.320
Dude, that's rad, man. I love

27:41.320 --> 27:44.320
everything about that. And I need to come out, I would love to come out and

27:44.320 --> 27:47.320
check out the place. I've never been to Thailand, by the way.

27:47.320 --> 27:50.320
I'm going to come. Oh, no way. Never, never.

27:50.320 --> 27:53.320
But I want to. It's been on the list for a while, so I'll make it happen.

27:53.320 --> 27:56.320
Here's what I want

27:56.320 --> 27:59.320
to ask really quick is, Aaron, are you still on the call?

27:59.320 --> 28:02.320
Yes. Aaron, I'm going to put you on the spot.

28:02.320 --> 28:05.320
What was your favorite thing about RankinRent?

28:05.320 --> 28:08.320
And Aaron has a really, we had an interview

28:08.320 --> 28:11.320
Aaron one of these days because he's one of the most persistent people

28:11.320 --> 28:14.320
I've ever met and I love him for that.

28:14.320 --> 28:17.320
What was the biggest thing for you?

28:17.320 --> 28:20.320
You're a very, you study a lot.

28:20.320 --> 28:23.320
You are pretty logical.

28:23.320 --> 28:26.320
What was the reason that you decided that RankinRent was the vehicle?

28:26.320 --> 28:29.320
Just for everyone here, because everyone has their own reasons.

28:29.320 --> 28:32.320
What was the number one thing for you?

28:32.320 --> 28:35.320
Yeah, I mean, a couple years ago when I first discovered it, I had

28:35.320 --> 28:38.320
boxes in my mind that had to check in order for me to be able to

28:38.320 --> 28:41.320
do something to make money. And this was the model

28:41.320 --> 28:44.320
that checked most boxes.

28:44.320 --> 28:47.320
Was there a specific box that stood out?

28:47.320 --> 28:50.320
There was a myriad of like equally important

28:50.320 --> 28:53.320
like one, I had to do it from home because I couldn't drive.

28:53.320 --> 28:56.320
I needed it to be where there was low.

28:56.320 --> 28:59.320
Aaron was 16 when he discovered this.

28:59.320 --> 29:02.320
So he's like, I got to do something I can do at my, you know.

29:02.320 --> 29:05.320
Yeah, and it had to be like low financial barrier to entry.

29:05.320 --> 29:08.320
And it had to be do something that I could learn the skill.

29:08.320 --> 29:11.320
And those were the three big ones.

29:11.320 --> 29:14.320
And then there's a couple other ones I'm trying to remember.

29:14.320 --> 29:17.320
But yeah, like that looks like a bunch and it had to work.

29:17.320 --> 29:20.320
Like, come on, we've all looked at drop shipping

29:20.320 --> 29:23.320
and affiliate marketing. And it's like, yeah.

29:23.320 --> 29:26.320
Anyway, so those were the boxes in it.

29:26.320 --> 29:29.320
Dude, I remember watching your YouTube video.

29:29.320 --> 29:32.320
To be fair, I saw one guy first talk about it.

29:32.320 --> 29:35.320
And then in the trending now or not, well, it wasn't trending for sure.

29:35.320 --> 29:38.320
It was the recommended watch section in YouTube, which I usually dislike

29:38.320 --> 29:41.320
because that's a time waster gets it down the rabbit hole.

29:41.320 --> 29:44.320
But it had Nick Wood video with like super dark background

29:44.320 --> 29:47.320
could barely see your face with like six views.

29:47.320 --> 29:50.320
And I clicked on it and that's when it made sense.

29:50.320 --> 29:53.320
So, yeah, for sure.

29:53.320 --> 29:56.320
Here we are. Here we are.

29:56.320 --> 29:59.320
And OK, thanks for jumping in, Aaron.

29:59.320 --> 30:02.320
Guys, the reason I wanted to ask is everyone has their reasoning.

30:02.320 --> 30:06.320
And I know when you're not in the model, like for me and Mike and Aaron,

30:06.320 --> 30:10.320
Jason, I think he might have to hop off because he's he's literally jumping on a call,

30:10.320 --> 30:13.320
which is awesome.

30:13.320 --> 30:18.320
I mean, just to show you like we're practicing what we preach

30:18.320 --> 30:24.320
when you're not in it, it seems so it's it's a tantalizing idea,

30:24.320 --> 30:29.320
but it still kind of seems like like there's that little bit of you that still doubts.

30:29.320 --> 30:32.320
Are these people actually making money?

30:32.320 --> 30:34.320
Mike V, did you ever have that doubt?

30:34.320 --> 30:36.320
Like, dude, this guy's full of crap.

30:36.320 --> 30:38.320
Maybe this doesn't really work.

30:38.320 --> 30:41.320
Or did you just blindly believe?

30:41.320 --> 30:45.320
Your answer is fine. I'm just curious.

30:45.320 --> 30:47.320
No, I mean, it makes sense.

30:47.320 --> 30:51.320
You know, local businesses need leads, you know,

30:51.320 --> 30:54.320
and people use Google to find local businesses.

30:54.320 --> 30:57.320
So I didn't think it was farfetched at all.

30:57.320 --> 31:01.320
I think it's one of the, you know, more classic business models

31:01.320 --> 31:07.320
where you're just getting a local business, local business, more business and taking a cut.

31:07.320 --> 31:09.320
And I agree 100 percent.

31:09.320 --> 31:13.320
It was kind of the same like I kind of I don't want to say I blindly followed.

31:13.320 --> 31:19.320
But for me, all that it took was understanding conceptually what was going on.

31:19.320 --> 31:22.320
But when I joined my first program back in 2016,

31:22.320 --> 31:26.320
I didn't ask the guy that sold me the program to show me a stripe account.

31:26.320 --> 31:28.320
I probably should have.

31:28.320 --> 31:34.320
I didn't ask who some, you know, I didn't see case studies like, you know,

31:34.320 --> 31:40.320
I think we have like 150, 200 plus case studies of people from all walks of life that are making money.

31:40.320 --> 31:43.320
I didn't see that kind of stuff. I was like, oh, that makes sense.

31:43.320 --> 31:46.320
How much is your program? Oh, eight thousand dollars.

31:46.320 --> 31:49.320
Boom. Let's go. You know, that kind of a thing.

31:49.320 --> 31:51.320
And I think that could get you in trouble.

31:51.320 --> 31:59.320
But I think for people like me and Mike, we kind of like my mentality is I'm going to figure it out.

31:59.320 --> 32:03.320
You know, as long as you can show me the map, I'm going to figure it out.

32:03.320 --> 32:08.320
And I heard her Mosi talk about this like he's like all the programs I've ever joined.

32:08.320 --> 32:13.320
He's like, I joined it as a student and then I quickly became the top person in that group.

32:13.320 --> 32:17.320
And then after I became the top person, I had people reaching out and then I did my own thing.

32:17.320 --> 32:20.320
And he's like, that's kind of the trend. And that's exactly what happened with me.

32:20.320 --> 32:23.320
That's exactly what happened with Mike. I joined my first group.

32:23.320 --> 32:27.320
I didn't really I was like, dude, I didn't see anyone making really good money.

32:27.320 --> 32:29.320
So I'm going to figure out how to make really good money.

32:29.320 --> 32:34.320
Got to one hundred thousand dollars a month, started talking about it, started my own and Mike, he joined.

32:34.320 --> 32:39.320
He's, you know, in Bali riding around his scooter and and figured this out.

32:39.320 --> 32:43.320
And he's doing he's at forty thousand bucks a month. He's one of our top students.

32:43.320 --> 32:47.320
I think you're at least top three. I know Ryan Dalton is up there.

32:47.320 --> 32:55.320
I know that there's a few, but you you might be number two or like you're one of the top students in our program.

32:55.320 --> 32:59.320
So anyway, guys, everyone's going to have a different reason.

32:59.320 --> 33:07.320
But I just want to let you guys know that if you're sitting there going, I don't know if this is actually as good as it sounds or if people are actually making money.

33:07.320 --> 33:12.320
That's totally normal. And it's completely fine to have those doubts.

33:12.320 --> 33:16.320
But I guess you should just like intuitively look at it and go.

33:16.320 --> 33:21.320
All right. Either either I have Mike completely lying through his teeth.

33:21.320 --> 33:24.320
I have Aaron lying through his teeth. I have Jason lying through his teeth.

33:24.320 --> 33:30.320
I have my brother Porter lying through his teeth, you know, or this actually does work.

33:30.320 --> 33:35.320
Or and I'm also lying repeatedly on my videos, which very well could be the case.

33:35.320 --> 33:38.320
And I could very well be capable of that for all you know.

33:38.320 --> 33:42.320
But it sounds like a lot of work to continually.

33:42.320 --> 33:46.320
I'd still watch them for the comedy aspect if it was BS.

33:49.320 --> 33:51.320
Speaking of bad videos. Yeah.

33:51.320 --> 33:59.320
Guys, Aaron, Aaron said he made a good point when I started digital landlords.

33:59.320 --> 34:02.320
I started it December 1st, 2021.

34:02.320 --> 34:08.320
And in March of 2022, I was on a trip to Mexico with my family.

34:08.320 --> 34:12.320
And I realized like I should probably start doing some of this branding stuff.

34:12.320 --> 34:14.320
I should probably start sharing some of this on YouTube.

34:14.320 --> 34:20.320
And if you don't have a YouTube channel or you've never done it, it's pretty intimidating to like make that commitment.

34:20.320 --> 34:27.320
Because you are no matter how confident you are, you're just all you're thinking about is, oh, my gosh, people that I know are going to see this.

34:27.320 --> 34:31.320
And who am I? And they're going to think that I think I'm this or that or the rest.

34:31.320 --> 34:33.320
And I remember I'm like, I just have to do it.

34:33.320 --> 34:38.320
And I made like a couple of videos and I was super stressed out.

34:38.320 --> 34:41.320
I went up into my into my room. My kids are at the pool.

34:41.320 --> 34:44.320
And I I told my wife, I'm like, hey, I'm going to go up.

34:44.320 --> 34:47.320
I'm going to make some videos. And I was so uncomfortable.

34:47.320 --> 34:49.320
And I'm like, who am I to talk about this business model?

34:49.320 --> 34:52.320
Meanwhile, I'd made millions of dollars doing this.

34:52.320 --> 34:56.320
But the point is what I'm going to bring up is that I just did it.

34:56.320 --> 35:00.320
I just started right. The videos Aaron's talking about.

35:00.320 --> 35:06.320
I think Aaron was at the video. I was sitting at this desk with no lighting and no it was no intro.

35:06.320 --> 35:11.320
It was the title was like seven hundred characters long.

35:11.320 --> 35:15.320
And it was like just really weird topics kind of stuff.

35:15.320 --> 35:21.320
Those kind of videos, dude, for sure, like super nice components of the business model.

35:21.320 --> 35:27.320
It was like why you should stop waiting for your website to rank before you sell a flat fee deal.

35:27.320 --> 35:31.320
Like no one would know what you're talking about unless you knew what ranking rent was.

35:31.320 --> 35:36.320
But I just I want to make this point like, guys, you're not going to have all the answers.

35:36.320 --> 35:41.320
You're not going to you're not going to be able to just like know 100 percent.

35:41.320 --> 35:43.320
There's always going to be an element of uncertainty.

35:43.320 --> 35:48.320
And if you're someone that's sitting there waiting for things to be 100 percent certain, it's not going to happen.

35:48.320 --> 35:53.320
Now I want to talk about this really quick and then we're going to get the Q&A.

35:53.320 --> 35:56.320
Timing is never going to be perfect, guys.

35:56.320 --> 36:05.320
It's not. By the way, speaking of that, did we did we release that episode on why you should start now from on our podcast?

36:05.320 --> 36:09.320
Yes. Aaron, we go get the link and I want you to share that in the chat, guys.

36:09.320 --> 36:14.320
I just did a podcast episode on Thursday and it's called Why You Should Start Now.

36:14.320 --> 36:19.320
Talking about this quote that my dad always told me, make hay while the sun shines.

36:19.320 --> 36:23.320
There is never going to be a perfect time. It's never going to be the perfect conditions.

36:23.320 --> 36:30.320
Mike, when you started this, was it the ideal time for you to jump in and start doing this full time?

36:30.320 --> 36:33.320
Was it the ideal time? I already know the answer is no.

36:33.320 --> 36:36.320
How did you still I'm just going to answer. No, it wasn't.

36:36.320 --> 36:40.320
How did you still get yourself to take action even though it wasn't a perfect time?

36:40.320 --> 36:48.320
No, it was terrible timing. I was about to drop a third of my net worth, which wasn't a lot at the time.

36:48.320 --> 36:53.320
And I was quitting my safety net job in 10 weeks.

36:53.320 --> 37:01.320
It's probably the worst time possible, but actually it was the best time possible because I had to make it work.

37:02.320 --> 37:06.320
I love that. It was the worst time, but might have been the best time.

37:06.320 --> 37:12.320
Guys, I'm telling you right now in this podcast episode that we're going to put in the comments.

37:12.320 --> 37:16.320
I talk about this. I don't care what it is in life.

37:16.320 --> 37:21.320
I don't care if it's when you're going to get married, when you're going to have kids, when you're going to start the business,

37:21.320 --> 37:26.320
when you're going to have that tough conversation, when you're going to go do that volunteer trip,

37:26.320 --> 37:30.320
when you're going to ask that girl out or the guy out.

37:30.320 --> 37:35.320
It does not matter. I promise you the timing is never going to be perfect.

37:35.320 --> 37:37.320
It's never going to be a good time.

37:37.320 --> 37:39.320
And you can either be one of two types of people.

37:39.320 --> 37:42.320
You can be the person that's always going to wait for the time to be perfect.

37:42.320 --> 37:48.320
Oh, I'm going to wait until I look at this thing or I check that or oh, we're going on this trip.

37:48.320 --> 37:54.320
We're going to wait till the trip's over or once this thing happens or oh, it's October.

37:54.320 --> 37:58.320
And we have Halloween coming up and then we have Thanksgiving.

37:58.320 --> 38:00.320
And then let's just start at the first year.

38:00.320 --> 38:05.320
You know, you know the type of person that's always starting the diet, but it's on Monday, right?

38:05.320 --> 38:07.320
I'm going to start on Monday, right?

38:07.320 --> 38:10.320
We all know that type of person. We've all been that type of person.

38:10.320 --> 38:13.320
The timing is never going to be perfect, just so you know, I promise you.

38:13.320 --> 38:18.320
And you can either be that person that's waiting or you can be the type that's like me and Mike.

38:18.320 --> 38:20.320
And I would I dare say Aaron as well.

38:20.320 --> 38:24.320
And I dare say Jason, even though I don't think he's on the call anymore.

38:24.320 --> 38:30.320
The type of person that I am is that when I feel like doing something, I just do it.

38:30.320 --> 38:35.320
And guys, sometimes that is terrible timing.

38:35.320 --> 38:39.320
Mike, have you ever done 75 hard?

38:39.320 --> 38:42.320
No, I never really did that because I've always been pretty disciplined anyway.

38:42.320 --> 38:45.320
Yeah, I didn't really do anything for you. And I totally get that.

38:45.320 --> 38:48.320
I've only done it once. I'm not a big Andy Frisella guy.

38:48.320 --> 38:52.320
I'm not a big like, you know, I actually think a lot of that stuff has value.

38:52.320 --> 38:55.320
I think the cold plunges are probably good for you.

38:55.320 --> 39:00.320
I just don't love when people post about it, that kind of stuff.

39:00.320 --> 39:02.320
But anyway, there's this thing called 75 hard.

39:02.320 --> 39:07.320
And I heard about it. And guys, I just like I just felt like I needed to do it.

39:07.320 --> 39:12.320
And I just started it. And I it was like in the winter, it was cold.

39:12.320 --> 39:16.320
I had a cruise coming up, a trip coming up.

39:17.320 --> 39:21.320
All these different things. And I just felt like I needed to do it because if I didn't do it, then I would never do it.

39:21.320 --> 39:28.320
And I remember being on my cruise and doing my second workout of the day up at the top of the cruise ship at 12 a.m.

39:28.320 --> 39:33.320
And not being able to eat the desserts, all these different things and being like, Nick, you're such an idiot.

39:33.320 --> 39:40.320
Why don't you just end? But then at the same time, realizing like that's why I am where I am because I just take action when I feel like it.

39:40.320 --> 39:46.320
And so I guess my point is, is I want you guys to understand whoever's on this call that's waiting for the perfect time.

39:46.320 --> 39:51.320
There's never going to be a perfect time. There's just not. That's just that's just how it is.

39:51.320 --> 39:54.320
So for sure. You got to jump in the trenches with anything.

39:54.320 --> 40:02.320
You know, there's definitely an element of trenches like I've grinded super hard leading up to leaving Thailand.

40:02.320 --> 40:07.320
You know, I was working five days a week at nine to five. I was working on this two hours a day after work.

40:07.320 --> 40:14.320
I was going to the gym six days a week. You know, I take some days off and there's definitely a lot of time in the trenches.

40:14.320 --> 40:21.320
But what really carried me through was the fact that I already committed to the program and I was reading the Think and Grow Rich books.

40:21.320 --> 40:24.320
So the subconscious mind was programmed like to get through.

40:24.320 --> 40:34.320
And when the moments do get tough, which they will, you still knew what that that dream outcome was and the consequences of not achieving it.

40:34.320 --> 40:38.320
Yeah. Yep. Same, man.

40:38.320 --> 40:45.320
When I started, I had my second child on the way. I just bought a house. I just bought another car.

40:45.320 --> 40:53.320
I was in the middle of the job that provided my entire yearly income for the whole year in five months,

40:53.320 --> 41:00.320
meaning if I messed it up or I distracted myself too much, I was risking my money.

41:01.320 --> 41:05.320
It's paying the bills. I was door knocking. I had no energy.

41:05.320 --> 41:10.320
I had no time, but I just went for it and I figured it out.

41:10.320 --> 41:13.320
And so those of you that are like, I don't have time. You do. You do.

41:13.320 --> 41:19.320
I promise. Especially you that don't have kids or that don't have other stuff like I had kids.

41:19.320 --> 41:25.320
I had a full time door knocking job. I had a wife. I was all these different responses.

41:25.320 --> 41:28.320
I was managing a team of guys that were also knocking with me.

41:28.320 --> 41:32.320
So anyway, I just want to talk about timing is never going to be perfect.

41:32.320 --> 41:37.320
Don't wait for it to be perfect. If you're that type of person, it's it's it's just going to be tough, man.

41:37.320 --> 41:40.320
You're going to sit there and wait forever. And we all know that type of person.

41:40.320 --> 41:51.320
They're sitting there. Oh, I don't want to start the campaign because I have, you know, I've got that double that I've got that shift with those extra hours.

41:51.320 --> 41:57.320
And what if a lead comes in while I'm at work? It's like, dude, you step out or you miss the call.

41:57.320 --> 42:00.320
You go in the bathroom and call it like you just figure it out.

42:00.320 --> 42:04.320
You would like if you guys are those type of people, it's going to be very, very difficult for you.

42:04.320 --> 42:08.320
So anyway, I've talked enough. I want to I do want to ask one more thing.

42:08.320 --> 42:11.320
And then any questions you guys have, we've got about 10 minutes.

42:11.320 --> 42:14.320
I'm going to let you guys ask questions in the comments.

42:14.320 --> 42:19.320
I'm going to have Aaron kind of filled those questions. You can ask Mike anything.

42:19.320 --> 42:23.320
But Mike, tell me about you said you're a pretty disciplined person.

42:23.320 --> 42:26.320
What does that mean? Are you disciplined with what you eat?

42:26.320 --> 42:30.320
Is it your schedule? Is it your routine? Is it your like your thoughts?

42:30.320 --> 42:33.320
When you say you're a pretty disciplined person, what do you mean?

42:33.320 --> 42:43.320
I guess when I've got a goal or something that I want to achieve, then, you know, I'll be pretty consistent with just the daily actions.

42:44.320 --> 42:52.320
For example, at the start of the year, I was on about 10k a month in December and I was like, I want to get to 40k a month.

42:52.320 --> 42:56.320
And I just asked myself, what is what does a 40k a month version of me do?

42:56.320 --> 43:00.320
And then just had the discipline to embody that.

43:00.320 --> 43:05.320
And then here we are now doing it.

43:05.320 --> 43:08.320
I was really always been in fitness and stuff.

43:09.320 --> 43:17.320
So I think that that comes with like not really drinking and going to the gym and just and eating well healthy.

43:17.320 --> 43:23.320
I think like right now I'm super tired and jet lag and flu and I haven't been able to like make money or work hard.

43:23.320 --> 43:30.320
So I think health help is a really important aspect of being successful, you know, launching a business as well.

43:31.320 --> 43:41.320
Do you think that people that are not disciplined can learn to be disciplined?

43:44.320 --> 43:51.320
Yeah, I think it's I remember watching a video back when I was driving to the corporate job doing digital landlords.

43:51.320 --> 43:59.320
And it's that classic motivation video where he's like, you know, when you want to when you want to be successful as much as you want to breathe.

44:00.320 --> 44:01.320
Then you'll be successful.

44:01.320 --> 44:13.320
And off the back of that, you have to have the discipline like you say, which is like so ingrained in my head, which I'm very grateful for is you have to do what needs to be done when it needs to be done, regardless of how you feel.

44:13.320 --> 44:26.320
And that's why I think your program and you as a person has been so awesome to be a part of this because of like your mindset and and just like the aggression that you have with with getting stuff done.

44:26.320 --> 44:32.320
Because you need to just you need to be disciplined with decisions you make and join up, you know, getting home from work.

44:32.320 --> 44:35.320
You don't want to do life transfers, but you've got to call them up.

44:35.320 --> 44:37.320
All that kind of stuff.

44:37.320 --> 44:48.320
It's easy on Sunday afternoon or Saturday afternoon when you're thinking about you kind of daydreaming about doing this job and living in Bali or living in Thailand and thinking about all this stuff.

44:48.320 --> 44:49.320
It's really easy.

44:49.320 --> 44:53.320
But then about Wednesday, you've had a couple bad nights of sleep.

44:53.320 --> 45:00.320
You've got your butt kicked by some of these business owners, you know, and I mean your butt kick like you've got yelled at you.

45:00.320 --> 45:03.320
You know, you're not feeling 100% gym.

45:03.320 --> 45:06.320
You're sore because of the gym, all this different stuff.

45:06.320 --> 45:09.320
And then by about Wednesday, it's really easy to start slipping.

45:09.320 --> 45:12.320
But it's so true, man.

45:12.320 --> 45:17.320
Once you figure out what it takes, like let's take anyone on this call.

45:17.320 --> 45:22.320
Let's say someone on this calls at zero dollars right now in this business and they want to get to 10k a month.

45:22.320 --> 45:25.320
There is an exact map of how you're going to get there, right?

45:25.320 --> 45:35.320
There is a certain number of people you need to call in order to get a certain amount of life transfers or opportunities to live transfer like trials.

45:35.320 --> 45:40.320
And there's a certain amount of trials you need to do to close a certain number of deals to get to 10k.

45:40.320 --> 45:44.320
And once you map that out, which we do train you how to do inside of digital landlords.

45:44.320 --> 45:51.320
Once you map that out, guys, all you have to do is just do the things that you have to do.

45:51.320 --> 45:53.320
And that's it. And you have to do them when they need to be done.

45:53.320 --> 45:57.320
And the hard part is when you don't feel like it like Mike V. Right.

45:57.320 --> 46:00.320
He's not feeling great today. He's jet lagged.

46:00.320 --> 46:03.320
He's sick, but he's on this call.

46:03.320 --> 46:08.320
Like today, it's Monday. It's I woke up at 630. I've been traveling all weekend.

46:08.320 --> 46:11.320
I didn't get much sleep. I was on two red eyes.

46:11.320 --> 46:16.320
It's my daughter's birthday. I've got every excuse in the world to be like, yeah, let's just skip this week.

46:16.320 --> 46:24.320
You know what I mean? But you just got to get in the habit of, hey, I on Mondays for me, I do this call and I don't care if I'm sick.

46:24.320 --> 46:27.320
I don't care if I didn't sleep last night. I just do this call.

46:27.320 --> 46:31.320
And Mike's done the same thing. You know, he has to do certain things.

46:31.320 --> 46:34.320
He has to call business owners at certain times and he has to do certain things.

46:34.320 --> 46:36.320
And that's why he's at 40k.

46:36.320 --> 46:39.320
And so it's not rocket science. It's not rocket science.

46:39.320 --> 46:42.320
Just doing what needs to be done when it needs to be done.

46:42.320 --> 46:45.320
And sometimes you don't feel like doing it. You gotta do it anyway.

46:45.320 --> 46:49.320
So great. Great point, bro.

46:49.320 --> 46:54.320
Aaron Vogler, do we have any comments, any questions, anything in the chat yet?

46:54.320 --> 46:58.320
Yes, Matt Torres says great to see Mike is successful.

46:58.320 --> 47:04.320
Absolutely. Like Mike, it was so cool when I first heard that you hit 40k because I remember watching your interview.

47:05.320 --> 47:09.320
I joined a few months, I think, after you had had that interview and I was just binge watching all this stuff.

47:09.320 --> 47:13.320
And I distinctly remembered yours because you kept harping on thinking Grow Rich.

47:13.320 --> 47:21.320
And I like that book a lot, too. And it was so cool to hear like less than two years later or two years later, whatever, that you'd like kept it going.

47:21.320 --> 47:25.320
And you were a pretty quiet guy. I mean, you don't like you're not super.

47:25.320 --> 47:30.320
It's not like you're having daily comments in the group, but it was so cool to just see you were grinding for two years and you hit that.

47:30.320 --> 47:34.320
Yeah, it's awesome. I just for the compliment.

47:34.320 --> 47:37.320
And yeah, back in the day, I was posting heat, but haven't posted too much.

47:37.320 --> 47:41.320
But it's always good to catch up with them. Everyone in the group.

47:41.320 --> 47:47.320
Yeah, you know, so it's good to point out, Mike, is that Mike V has gotten to 40k.

47:47.320 --> 47:50.320
And what has it been? Two and a half years, two years and some months.

47:50.320 --> 47:55.320
What has it been? About two years. Yeah, two years.

47:55.320 --> 48:06.320
He's got the 40k in two years. But what you guys might not have caught is that there was like a year of that that Mike basically just went and lived life.

48:06.320 --> 48:10.320
Like he got to 10k and then he and that was his plan.

48:10.320 --> 48:14.320
And that's what I love about Mike is he's very disciplined, but he's intentional.

48:14.320 --> 48:19.320
And if like and that's what I think you guys need to realize is you don't have to be on all the time.

48:19.320 --> 48:25.320
If you tell yourself, hey, I'm going to work four days a week and then I'm going to frickin Fridays.

48:25.320 --> 48:28.320
I'm going to go and I'm going to go see the country that I live in.

48:28.320 --> 48:30.320
I'm going to go do this. It's all about being intentional.

48:30.320 --> 48:33.320
So, Mike, for Mike, he got to 10k.

48:33.320 --> 48:40.320
And then what do you spend like a year basically like just traveling because that's what you plan on doing.

48:40.320 --> 48:44.320
Yeah, we got to 10k and then I traveled all over Southeast Asia for a whole year.

48:44.320 --> 48:47.320
And then I was like, OK, let's scale it up.

48:47.320 --> 48:50.320
Yeah, yeah, I remember that.

48:50.320 --> 48:53.320
I remember you. That was your story.

48:53.320 --> 48:57.320
And you're like, and you know what I admire about that is that was your plan.

48:57.320 --> 49:01.320
And, you know, it's kind of like that.

49:01.320 --> 49:05.320
Have you heard that song by Macklemore called Make the Money?

49:05.320 --> 49:07.320
You ever heard that?

49:07.320 --> 49:10.320
A really good song. It's called Make the it's like says make the money.

49:10.320 --> 49:12.320
Don't let the money make you.

49:12.320 --> 49:16.320
And it's like we have we make money not for money's sake.

49:16.320 --> 49:19.320
We make money for a specific reason.

49:19.320 --> 49:22.320
And so anyway, I just admire that you you had a plan.

49:22.320 --> 49:26.320
You wanted to move to Thailand to have a lifestyle.

49:26.320 --> 49:28.320
And you wanted this to fund the lifestyle.

49:28.320 --> 49:30.320
And then once you did it, you went and executed.

49:30.320 --> 49:32.320
And then when you decided to get busy, you decided to get busy.

49:32.320 --> 49:33.320
And now you're at 40k.

49:33.320 --> 49:38.320
And I have no doubt that if next year you decide to go and hit 100k, you're going to hit 100k.

49:38.320 --> 49:39.320
I truly believe that.

49:39.320 --> 49:42.320
So anyway, Matt Torres, shout out to Matt Torres.

49:42.320 --> 49:44.320
And yeah, shout out to Mike for making it happen.

49:44.320 --> 49:46.320
What else we got, Aaron, anything?

49:46.320 --> 49:48.320
Yeah, for sure. We got like two questions here.

49:48.320 --> 49:51.320
So Eric Funk says great conversation, guys.

49:51.320 --> 49:52.320
I have a general Google ask question.

49:52.320 --> 49:58.320
Are you setting keywords for exact match or phrase match or mix of both?

49:58.320 --> 50:00.320
Yeah, I just run phrase match.

50:00.320 --> 50:05.320
You know, concrete contractor, concrete specialist, concrete layer, concrete company.

50:05.320 --> 50:10.320
I think concrete plus city, all is phrase match.

50:10.320 --> 50:16.320
I would say that negative keywords can be you definitely want to consider those.

50:16.320 --> 50:21.320
But even on top of that, you know, if you've got four campaigns live, which you should,

50:21.320 --> 50:27.320
which is what I had at every given point leading up to leaving, you know,

50:27.320 --> 50:33.320
you could set up the exact same campaign in a different city and get zero leads from it.

50:33.320 --> 50:35.320
So yeah, just just set up the basics.

50:35.320 --> 50:36.320
Use your phrase match.

50:36.320 --> 50:39.320
But just remember that it's more important to have three guys on trials,

50:39.320 --> 50:44.320
because not all of them are going to work, no matter what, how you what keywords you've got.

50:44.320 --> 50:46.320
Absolutely. We got an action.

50:46.320 --> 50:48.320
I'm just letting Jason in already.

50:48.320 --> 50:51.320
We'll see if he closed that deal.

50:51.320 --> 50:53.320
While you let Jason, I want to say one thing really quick.

50:53.320 --> 50:57.320
That question lets me know that whoever that person is and not to call that person out,

50:57.320 --> 51:00.320
but just like that person is the type that's there.

51:00.320 --> 51:03.320
You're trying to avoid paying the piper.

51:03.320 --> 51:11.320
OK, so and I can tell because that question is specific enough that you you've watched a lot of content.

51:11.320 --> 51:13.320
You've listened to a lot of stuff.

51:13.320 --> 51:15.320
You're doing everything except for paying the piper.

51:15.320 --> 51:18.320
So you either got to pay the piper, you got to pay someone that pays the piper.

51:18.320 --> 51:23.320
You know, you're not going to jump on and like every single little nuanced question.

51:23.320 --> 51:25.320
This is all the stuff that's covered.

51:25.320 --> 51:29.320
But the question I would ask that person is like, why are you wasting time trying to pick up a piece here,

51:29.320 --> 51:33.320
pick up a piece there? Why not just go in and like get the full thing?

51:33.320 --> 51:37.320
And so I could just tell by based on how specific that question is,

51:37.320 --> 51:42.320
that you're trying to avoid doing everything but just paying the piper.

51:42.320 --> 51:49.320
So for me, what I did is when I ran Google Ads, like for me, I bought I bought a program that spent eight grand.

51:49.320 --> 51:50.320
That's how I learned the basics.

51:50.320 --> 51:53.320
Then I spent up one point four million dollars learning ads.

51:53.320 --> 51:56.320
That's how I learned the answers to questions you're asking.

51:56.320 --> 51:58.320
Mike, he did the opposite.

51:58.320 --> 51:59.320
He paid me.

51:59.320 --> 52:01.320
I taught him ads and he learned.

52:01.320 --> 52:04.320
And of course, he's learned other stuff since then through running his own campaigns.

52:04.320 --> 52:11.320
But just to remind everyone, like we're going to do everything we can on these calls to get you guys value.

52:11.320 --> 52:15.320
I mean, that was a great answer and a correct answer.

52:15.320 --> 52:19.320
But just understand that like no matter what, no matter what way you slice it,

52:19.320 --> 52:22.320
there are laws of the universe and you can't avoid them.

52:22.320 --> 52:26.320
And one thing you can't do is you can't get a six pack without putting in work.

52:26.320 --> 52:32.320
And I know there's some of these people out there taking ozempic, whatever, and or taking steroids to use the male example.

52:32.320 --> 52:34.320
I know males use ozempic.

52:34.320 --> 52:36.320
And I know they think they're cheating the system.

52:36.320 --> 52:41.320
But if y'all don't think there's negative side effects to taking steroids or taking ozempic, we'll see.

52:41.320 --> 52:42.320
We'll see.

52:42.320 --> 52:44.320
There's no shortcut to a six pack.

52:44.320 --> 52:46.320
There's no shortcut to a million dollars a year.

52:46.320 --> 52:49.320
There's no shortcut to having a great relationship.

52:49.320 --> 52:50.320
So that's just the facts.

52:50.320 --> 52:53.320
Jason already did you close the deal or did he know show you?

52:57.320 --> 52:59.320
Yeah, I closed it.

52:59.320 --> 53:00.320
Yeah, buddy.

53:00.320 --> 53:02.320
What'd you get?

53:02.320 --> 53:06.320
Fourteen hundred per month in concrete.

53:06.320 --> 53:08.320
My man.

53:08.320 --> 53:11.320
Concrete saturated, Jason.

53:11.320 --> 53:13.320
No, it is.

53:13.320 --> 53:15.320
There's you just got to put in the due diligence, man.

53:15.320 --> 53:19.320
Put in the work to find a good area and go get those deals.

53:19.320 --> 53:21.320
It's crazy.

53:21.320 --> 53:22.320
Amazing.

53:22.320 --> 53:23.320
Fourteen hundred dollars a month deal.

53:23.320 --> 53:25.320
Concrete live.

53:25.320 --> 53:28.320
Yeah, Jason, it is saturated, bro.

53:28.320 --> 53:30.320
Why are you still in concrete, dude?

53:30.320 --> 53:34.320
Dude, did you guys not know rank and rent saturated?

53:34.320 --> 53:36.320
Why you guys?

53:36.320 --> 53:41.320
You know, honestly, like, is it as many people as you see in the rank and rent industry?

53:41.320 --> 53:51.320
Like, you know, just this overall, like, I think there's so little people that are willing to take the action that we're willing to take over here and deal that.

53:51.320 --> 53:53.320
It's not as saturated as you think.

53:53.320 --> 53:58.320
There's so many sites that actually aren't being rented out, like you've mentioned several times.

53:58.320 --> 54:05.320
And, you know, people can rate websites, but how many people are actually calling business owners and trying to close deals?

54:05.320 --> 54:07.320
Not very many.

54:07.320 --> 54:10.320
There's a lot of hungry business owners out there.

54:10.320 --> 54:13.320
How much does that put you?

54:13.320 --> 54:14.320
What are you at now per month?

54:14.320 --> 54:16.320
I don't know if you lost any.

54:16.320 --> 54:18.320
In the meantime, what are you at per month?

54:18.320 --> 54:26.320
I'll have to go recount because I lost a twelve hundred dollar per month deal and then he's in a cold area.

54:26.320 --> 54:30.320
So I'm going to we're still going to talk about it, but the lead slowed down, so I lost him.

54:30.320 --> 54:35.320
So we're actually, I think I'm at thirteen, six hundred, but I got two more closing calls scheduled.

54:35.320 --> 54:39.320
So we're going to get those numbers up before winter hits.

54:39.320 --> 54:42.320
Amazing.

54:42.320 --> 54:43.320
Was that Aaron?

54:43.320 --> 54:44.320
Yeah, I was going to say real quick.

54:44.320 --> 54:47.320
I know we're going to be wrapping it up soon, but this is just the last question.

54:47.320 --> 54:48.320
I know Laura's been on from the beginning.

54:48.320 --> 54:55.320
She had asked, and Mike, this is more directed to you, but I'm sure Jason, I mean, you're at over 10K in like less than three months when you started to actually get focused.

54:55.320 --> 55:01.320
But the question is, what are some mindset tips that helped you shift from 10K to 40K?

55:01.320 --> 55:03.320
This is for Mike.

55:03.320 --> 55:05.320
Yeah, this is mainly for Mike.

55:05.320 --> 55:12.320
OK, also, what I want you to do while he's answering that question, Aaron, is I want you to screenshot everyone that's on this call so we can get them to reply.

55:12.320 --> 55:21.320
Secondly, is I want you to drop a link for anybody that is that realizes that they would rather pay somebody that's paid the piper.

55:21.320 --> 55:25.320
So drop a link to digital landlords for those that actually want to apply.

55:25.320 --> 55:28.320
Again, you don't have to apply, guys. I'm going to keep showing up for these calls.

55:28.320 --> 55:30.320
I'm going to keep being in the live group.

55:30.320 --> 55:37.320
I guess I just sit there and I ask, why the hell are we still trying to avoid the thing that's got to happen?

55:37.320 --> 55:40.320
So for those of you that are finally like, OK, it's time.

55:40.320 --> 55:43.320
I want you to drop that link while Mike's answering the question.

55:43.320 --> 55:45.320
So go ahead, Mike, answer that question.

55:45.320 --> 55:49.320
What's the mindset shift that went from 10 to 40?

55:49.320 --> 55:52.320
Yeah, from 10 to 40.

55:52.320 --> 55:56.320
My mindset was pretty good because I honestly just wanted to make 2K a month.

55:56.320 --> 55:58.320
That was my original goal. That was the price of freedom.

55:58.320 --> 56:08.320
So hitting 10K a month, like, hey, if I was able to do something that I previously thought was completely impossible, then, you know, I've got supreme confidence and literally just picking.

56:08.320 --> 56:18.320
It was just like I said before, just pick a number and then work back from what that version of Laura or whoever it is is doing.

56:18.320 --> 56:27.320
And I think on the side note, being around other people who are making similar numbers can definitely help because that will just make everything more real.

56:27.320 --> 56:35.320
You know, everyone's talking about 40K or, you know, what are these people doing that you're not kind of thing?

56:35.320 --> 56:42.320
Like Nick says, it's not it's equally about what you need to do to get there, but also what you need to not do.

56:42.320 --> 56:45.320
And a big part of that is keeping things simple.

56:45.320 --> 56:54.320
You know what I was just going to say is I was going to say, I don't know if you guys have noticed on this interview, but Mike, Mike's not telling like and this is what I noticed this about everyone doing big numbers, right?

56:54.320 --> 57:00.320
And Dalton, the same thing. It's like, Mike, like when you guys ask Mike questions, he's giving you very simple answers.

57:00.320 --> 57:09.320
And I think probably maybe some of you guys are expecting like some intricate answer or this crazy niche that he's in or do this little hack or whatever.

57:09.320 --> 57:22.320
And it's like I've learned more than anything, being around people that are successful, that the people that are making the most money are the ones that are just disciplined in doing the simple stuff that works and disciplined in not doing the stuff that does not move the needle.

57:22.320 --> 57:29.320
That's it. And I could tell Mike, you're very disciplined in not doing what shouldn't be done and doing what should be done.

57:29.320 --> 57:45.320
I'll kind of say one more thing. Just what you said to me in our last interview, you know, when I was making 8K a month, you just said, Mike, all you need to do is do this, you know, 10 more times, 15 more times, and then you're going to be a 30K a month, whatever.

57:45.320 --> 57:52.320
So that was an extremely simple way to look at the task ahead and then just show up daily.

57:52.320 --> 57:57.320
That was it for me, man. I heard somebody talk about something they said, and I don't know why it clicked that time.

57:57.320 --> 58:06.320
They said, if you've made $1,000 doing this business model, you have a $1,000 a month client, why don't you have 100 of those?

58:06.320 --> 58:17.320
Why are you trying to reinvent the wheel? Why aren't you just doing that 100 times? Or why don't you, instead of doing 100 times, why don't you double your price and do it 50 times?

58:17.320 --> 58:26.320
And I was like, yeah, that's what I should do. I should stop trying to do SEO, build websites, do consulting, do social media management.

58:26.320 --> 58:32.320
Why don't I just do this one thing that works really, really well and just do it 100 times? And that's when I scaled up to 100K.

58:32.320 --> 58:43.320
And it was like, I think I'm just so stupid. I needed to hear an answer that was that simple. And it was like, oh, yeah, that makes sense.

58:43.320 --> 58:48.320
That's such a good answer. Just do it. Do it 100 more times. It's so simple.

58:48.320 --> 58:53.320
That's it. It's like that phrase, kiss, keep it stupid, stupid, simple, or keep it simple.

58:53.320 --> 58:57.320
For me, it's keep it simple, stupid, right? Either one.

58:57.320 --> 59:06.320
Just gotta get that first deal and then that's it. Just do it 50 more times, 10 more times, whatever number it is that will allow you to live the lifestyle that you want.

59:06.320 --> 59:14.320
Guys, it's not rocket science. I keep saying rocket scientists. It's been a long weekend. It's not rocket science. I'm nothing special.

59:14.320 --> 59:26.320
I know, speaking for me, I know that everyone else on this call, Mike, Jason, these guys have really special qualities, but they weren't born with some...

59:27.320 --> 59:37.320
We're not Bill Gates caliber minds. We're just people that are simple, doing the simple work, but doing it again and again and again, even though we don't feel like doing it.

59:37.320 --> 59:48.320
Doing it on a... Jason just barely scheduled a closing call on a Monday at 7 a.m. That just shows you where his head's at. He's grinding, man. I love that.

59:48.320 --> 59:53.320
So, Mike V, thank you for being on the call, man. Do you have anything else you want to add, Aaron?

59:53.320 --> 59:55.320
I think we're good. Great call.

59:55.320 --> 01:00:03.320
Amazing call. For those of you that were on this call, we're going to get you guys to replay and we will be doing another call next week.

01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:16.320
But again, I would just recommend, guys, if you actually are serious about making money, you either got to just hunker down and say, hey, I'm going to do what Nick did and spend five years and $1.4 million,

01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:25.320
or you can do what Mike did, and it's a much quicker option to say, hey, let's just get the blueprint. Same with Jason, same with Aaron, and let's go and learn that and get there quicker.

01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:34.320
And basically, Mike's basically got to $40K in a year because he took a year off, but obviously we can't say that, but essentially getting to $40K in a year.

01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:44.320
So anyway, that said, guys, and Jason, I think Jason started in January. He's eight, nine months into this, 10 months into this, and he's at almost $14K per month.

01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:51.320
So, proof's in the pudding. Appreciate you guys being on the call. Thank you, Mike. V, go get some sleep, get feeling better, and we'll talk soon.

01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:54.320
Thanks, guys. Bye.
