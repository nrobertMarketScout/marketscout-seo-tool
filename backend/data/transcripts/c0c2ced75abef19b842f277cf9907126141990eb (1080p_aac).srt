1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,740
Okay, now we are going to cover how much content do you really need on your website and I would

2
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:14,760
say that you want to look at your competition.

3
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,480
So once you do the due diligence, you know what the top three websites are that are ranking

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,840
in that area.

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,640
Look at how much content they have on their pages and double that, double the competition.

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,780
So do better than everyone else that you're trying to rank for.

7
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:35,180
And then the standard, if you want to know an average, would be we usually do 2,000 words

8
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:41,540
for the homepage and then we do 1,000 words for each service pages.

9
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:42,820
So that's 3,000.

10
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:50,100
If you have a website with one homepage and three service pages, that is 5,000 words worth

11
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,700
of content.

12
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:57,860
And then I know that we have a contact page, but we actually do not write content for the

13
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,620
contact page.

14
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:01,100
And that is it.
