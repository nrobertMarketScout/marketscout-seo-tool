Website speed is a big thing.

00:01.180 --> 00:03.900
We website speed is important, but it's not more.

00:03.900 --> 00:05.180
It's not more important than content.

00:05.280 --> 00:06.740
And I know you're not saying that.

00:07.500 --> 00:08.040
And I agree.

00:08.040 --> 00:13.600
Website speed is important, but again, uh, I've done some crazy damage in a good

00:13.600 --> 00:19.500
way with just solid, solid content and a couple of backlinks in good due diligence.

00:19.500 --> 00:19.840
Okay.
