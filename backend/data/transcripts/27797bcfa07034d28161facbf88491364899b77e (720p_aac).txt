Zach, I have a client that wants to go into real estate, but it's too competitive in the city he
wants. Do you ever tell people, no, because it's too competitive? Oh, all the time. What I do there,
Zach, is I say, hey, man, what I'm going to have to charge you to make it worth it, you're probably
not going to want to pay. And they're going to go, how much is that? And I'd quote them at some
astronomical price. And if they end up saying, love us, let's do it, do it, and then go outsource
it, right? Kyle Goldstein has a ton of huge SEO clients. And it's because he charges ridiculous
prices. And they say yes. Okay, so that's what I would do. Because you don't really need the deal.
And it's like real estate, how long are they going to stay, it's going to be paying the
quote on some stupid amount. And then if they say yes, great. If not, you didn't lose anything.
