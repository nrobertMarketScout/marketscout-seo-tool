Okay, Spencer, what are some tells that a BO is legitimately hungry to grow beyond just yes,

00:06.400 --> 00:12.560
the direct question? Well, obvious one is that they're paying for ads, right? And here's how

00:12.560 --> 00:17.360
I look at it. If you're paying for leads or you're paying for ads and you tell me you're

00:17.360 --> 00:23.680
not hungry to grow, you're a dumbass. That means you're allergic to money, right? So number one is,

00:23.680 --> 00:28.160
I think the biggest telltale sign is they're paying for ads. Now, does it get a little bit trickier

00:28.160 --> 00:32.320
if they're on Home Advisor and you're like, oh, well, are they active on Home Advisor? Did they

00:32.320 --> 00:37.360
have Home Advisor in the past? Now it's shut off. There's a difference between being on Home

00:37.360 --> 00:41.200
Advisor, being on Andy's List and actually actively paying, right? But if they're paying

00:41.200 --> 00:48.320
for Google Ads, it's a pretty good sign. But that's a good question, Spencer. I think, yeah,

00:48.320 --> 00:55.440
Spencer asked that. For me, it's a feeling. For me, it's a soft skill. For me, I got to hear

00:55.440 --> 01:01.920
their tone of their voice. I got to do that cold call and I can tell. And here's the advice I want

01:01.920 --> 01:08.240
to give you is when you are in doubt, when you are in doubt if that business owner is actually

01:08.240 --> 01:14.080
legitimately hungry to grow, heat check them, pull back right there on the spot, okay? Here's

01:14.080 --> 01:18.080
the example. All right, get to the end of the call. Hey, Mr. Business Owner, you got done. You got

01:18.080 --> 01:21.280
the phone number. I'm going to send you a couple of leads. Hey, let me just ask you this really

01:21.280 --> 01:26.160
quick. And I hate to be like, you know, repeating myself, but like, are you hungry to grow? Because

01:27.120 --> 01:31.040
look, I want to work with you. I'm willing to give you a couple of leads at no charge. But if

01:31.040 --> 01:34.880
I'm going to just, if I'm going to call you with a lead that's live and you're not going to answer

01:34.880 --> 01:39.040
the phone, just tell me right now so that I don't waste my time, okay? Because I'm only going to

01:39.040 --> 01:42.560
work with one company. Are you actually hungry to grow? You just tell me what I want to hear.

01:44.960 --> 01:48.160
I know when I say that out loud, that's like, oh shit, that's pretty bold.

01:49.040 --> 01:55.600
Yeah, it is. But guess what? You right there by doing that pullback, you are going to give them

01:55.600 --> 02:00.080
the chance that if they actually are not interested, they actually are not hungry,

02:01.040 --> 02:05.440
they can just run along. They can let you know right there on the spot. Yeah, actually Spencer,

02:05.440 --> 02:08.960
it's funny you asked that. I don't know, man. I don't know if we're like, we're actually that

02:08.960 --> 02:13.680
hungry and blah, blah, blah. Okay, cool. Thanks for telling me. Thanks for telling me. Now,

02:14.400 --> 02:18.000
is it just because you don't understand what I'm doing here or are you like, and maybe like,

02:18.720 --> 02:24.000
don't be afraid to check people, man. A lot of times we get that, yes, yeah, it sounds good,

02:24.000 --> 02:27.600
but we're like deep down, we know they're actually not interested. They're just telling us what we

02:27.600 --> 02:32.480
want to hear, but we're so damn afraid to ask the hard questions because of what we might hear.

02:33.120 --> 02:39.520
Be okay to ask that question, even if it means you might get the answer you don't want to hear,

02:39.520 --> 02:43.280
because I'd rather do that than waste the next three days and three leads on somebody

02:43.280 --> 02:47.680
who's ghosting me. Okay, that's the best thing. And all the other things, telltale signs,

02:48.240 --> 02:53.440
when in doubt, do a pullback at the end of that first call. And if at the end of the first call,

02:53.440 --> 02:57.360
it seems good. And then by the next call, they're dicking around with you, ghosting you,

02:57.360 --> 03:01.360
do the pullback, leave them a message, call them, ask them, hey, man, I know we talked yesterday,

03:01.360 --> 03:04.960
I gave you that lead, but I'm not getting the greatest vibes. Like, are you hungry to grow?

03:04.960 --> 03:09.120
If not, I'll find somebody else and I'm not trying to be a dick. Do a pullback. Okay.
