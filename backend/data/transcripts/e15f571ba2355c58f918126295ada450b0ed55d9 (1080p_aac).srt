1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,280
you have to make a decision once and for all that you do not take, I want to think about it.

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,760
If you, if I'm selling to you, and you kind of give me some bullshit about you want to think

3
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:17,440
about it, I'm just going to go ahead and tell you that I've already thought about it for you.

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,720
And if, and this is how I phrase it, guys, this is exactly how I do it. I'm not,

5
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:25,920
I am very blunt, but I say to you this, Mr. Business Owner,

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,760
respectfully, because I do enough of these, because I'm literally, we're trying to go across

7
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,520
the nation within, in the best cities possible, it makes zero sense for me. If I let you think

8
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,680
about it, and I let everyone else on my calendar think about it, by Wednesday, I'm going to have

9
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,560
to follow up with 10 people. And all I'm going to do is spend my time following up. And then I got

10
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,440
to hop back on the call with you if you decide to do it. And then we got to go through the onboarding

11
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,520
and the whole deal. So I'm just going to, like a couple of years ago, what I did is I made a

12
00:00:53,520 --> 00:01:01,360
commitment. I do not do, I want to think about it. I have sent you five leads. You have closed

13
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:05,840
X amount of dollars if they've closed, right? You already are sold on advertising because you

14
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,560
were paying for XYZ service. You already told me you hate that service. You already told me you

15
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,800
want to grow. You know I can bring the heat. You've already seen some of my testimonials.

16
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:21,760
And I review all the objections I've overcome. If after all of that, because I know that the

17
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:28,400
last company sure didn't give you free leads, if after all of that, you're not a yes, and it's a

18
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:34,080
still I want to think about it, this ain't a good fit. This is not a good fit. And I don't want you

19
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:38,000
to take this wrong. And I'm not trying to burn a bridge. I don't burn a bridge. But this is not a

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
good fit. I need partners that want to grow. I need partners that are hungry. I need somebody

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,480
that wants to go freaking tear someone's throat off and go take over a city and take over a state.

22
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,200
So if this makes sense, let's rock and roll. If it doesn't, then we're not doing the I want

23
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,920
to think about it. You want to do this or not? And then what I'll say is I'll go like,

24
00:01:54,480 --> 00:02:00,240
look, Sam, look, Carl, you and I both know this is the right move. Let's freaking do this deal,

25
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,120
man. Amex or Visa. Let me take the card. Grab my pen. Boom, baby. Right back for the close.
