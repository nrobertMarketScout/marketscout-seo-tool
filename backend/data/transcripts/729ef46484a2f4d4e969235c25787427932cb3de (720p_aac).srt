1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,920
Beautiful. Okay. Let's do this. So guys, welcome to I think this is like the seventh call that

2
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:14,120
we've actually done with this format. Let me get my mic a little bit closer. Again,

3
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:18,280
we used to do as many people as we could on the Facebook group vanity metrics. Let's get

4
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:23,560
a whole bunch of people that also last thing, Jason, please make sure everyone's muted.

5
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:27,400
I think it's default to mute everybody. But if you see that it just distracts on the call.

6
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:35,720
Just mute everybody. Anyway, this is I think our seventh call. What we're going to do and what I

7
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:40,840
always do is if you stay on this call till the end and you have your camera on obviously,

8
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:45,920
then we're going to screenshot everybody that's on this call with around like the last five

9
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:52,040
minutes and we're going to automatically create and send you guys a digital resource that covers

10
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,720
the things that we talk about in this call. So it's basically going to be the cheat sheet,

11
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,000
the notes that normally you'd have to take or that you should take the highlights. I don't want you

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,520
to sit here and take notes on everything because we're going to send that to you if you stay on

13
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:08,680
the call. What I would rather you do what I want you to do is I want you to just listen and I want

14
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:14,040
you to the things that come to your mind, the things that the ideas that you have, that's what

15
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,880
I want you to write down because I'm going to send you the information that I'm going to talk about.

16
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,600
I want you to think about and I want you to write down the things that come to your mind. So as I

17
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,640
talk today, you're going to have these ideas that I'm going to spark because of things that I say

18
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:34,760
and that's what I want you to write down. Also, I am going, because this is a more intimate

19
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:39,560
like session, I am going to leave time for Q&A. So if you guys do have questions and you don't

20
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:43,640
want to forget those questions, just start dropping them in the comments and I'm going to

21
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,920
probably Jason read them for me towards the end. Try to stick to competition questions,

22
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,480
but if you have other questions and we have time, I'll also

23
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:58,520
fill those as well. So that said, guys, let's get into this. Again, anything that I talk about,

24
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:05,880
and I'll start with this actually, just for the person or the people that don't know, I know some

25
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,920
of you guys have been on a few of these calls, so this might be redundant. That's fine. This is my

26
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:16,680
eighth year doing this business. I don't know how many niches, probably well over 30 niches

27
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:24,120
I've tried this in. I don't know how many cities, probably over 100 cities. I've lost millions,

28
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:29,960
like literally lost millions of dollars. I've gone $60,000 of debt. I've almost quit twice.

29
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:35,960
And I mean, seriously, like when I almost quit in 2019, I had another sales job completely

30
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:41,960
lined out, commissions agreed upon, ready to just shut down my agency, ready to get rid of

31
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:47,880
everyone on my team and just be a sales guy. And I figured it out and I stuck with it.

32
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:51,960
And then in 2020, we finally figured this out. There were some missing pieces. For those of you

33
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:58,360
guys that are in other programs, for those of you that are learning rank and rent, the old school

34
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:04,360
antiquated method where you build a website, you put in all this time and you wait for it to rank,

35
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,480
you guys are doing it the wrong way. And I truly mean that. And I'm telling you that

36
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,920
you're never going to scale doing it how you're doing it. You will never scale.

37
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:23,560
And I know that from experience. So I used to call this the most perfectly broken business

38
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:29,960
model on the internet because it's broken. It's perfect because it checks all the boxes. It's

39
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:36,920
recurring. You own the asset, it's scalable, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. But it's broken

40
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:43,480
because you are rolling the dice. Meaning you're building a website, you're hoping that it ranks,

41
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:49,400
and if it doesn't, you're screwed. If it does, you're hoping that there's leads. If there are

42
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,440
leads, you're hoping there's a business owner that's hungry. If there's a hungry business owner,

43
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,600
you're hoping you can sell them. And all the while you're waiting six to nine months to even

44
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,920
check this out. You don't even know. That's why it's broken and that's why it's unscalable.

45
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:05,640
But once you start flipping this on its head, once you start actually selling the deal first

46
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:10,920
and pre-selling the deal, then you start to be able to scale. You're able to go into a market,

47
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:15,480
spend a couple hundred dollars, see if it's actually a good market, and then confidently

48
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:20,040
go in using somebody else's money. That's how you scale this thing. And so I think about it the

49
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:28,120
same way as real estate. If I was going to build a massive portfolio of real estate portfolio,

50
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:33,800
it would be very, very, very, very difficult for me to do it if I had to pay for all the houses

51
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:39,480
myself. Imagine I had to go buy all the houses with my own money, do the down payments or

52
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:44,760
no, not even the down payments, the construction loan, all of it, and then try to scale. On the

53
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:49,800
flip side, what if I could go and I could use everyone else's money and I could already have

54
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,520
a guaranteed renter? I could go and build this thing as big as I wanted to. And guys, some of

55
00:04:54,520 --> 00:05:00,440
the biggest real estate companies in the world, there's a company in Dubai called EMAR. This is

56
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:04,360
what they do. Every single person that comes to that city, they stand in the mall, they send out

57
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:09,960
flyers, they're hitting you up. They are everywhere. And what they do is basically they bring you in,

58
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,800
they give you the presentation, they tell you why they're the best, and they get you to put

59
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:19,560
money down on a project, on a specific unit, you pay a chunk upfront, and then they put you on a

60
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:25,240
payment plan, and they basically have you pay for the project. They have little risk and they know

61
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:30,360
that it's done and sold by the time it's finished. So if some of the biggest, I think it might be

62
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:37,160
the biggest or one of the biggest in the world, for sure in Dubai, companies, construction companies

63
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,400
in the world is doing this, then why the heck wouldn't we do this? It's the same exact concept.

64
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:47,320
So for those that are hearing other advice, I want you to think about that person that's giving you

65
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:52,280
advice, that program, that whatever, maybe it's someone you follow on YouTube. How much money are

66
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,560
they actually making from this model? What you're going to find is most of the time they're not even

67
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:01,080
in the game A, and if they are, they're not making any money. And a lot of times you're getting this

68
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:06,440
advice, build, build, build, build more websites. Why? You shouldn't be building more websites unless

69
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:11,480
it works. And I've said this example before, but going and building 100 or 200 websites

70
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:18,840
without pre-selling them is like building 100 units. And then you open your eyes one day and

71
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,720
you're like, oh my gosh, we forgot to put toilets in these things. And I know that's kind of an

72
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:30,040
extreme example, but it's like, guys, that's what I did. I went into the wrong niche. I went into the

73
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:35,320
wrong freaking niche. I built like 50 of these things and pulled my head out and went, oh my gosh,

74
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:41,320
I just built 50 of these in the wrong niche. I got lucky on the first one and it was complete

75
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:47,240
fluke. And then I built 49 more in the wrong freaking niche because I wasn't pre-selling.

76
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:52,280
So that said guys, I've been in the game a long time. Anything that I talk about on these calls

77
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:57,880
is from experience. And if I haven't done it, I'll tell you. And 99% of the time, I won't even cover

78
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:05,160
it anyway. Okay. So my promise to you guys, my goal to you guys for this call is that by the end

79
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:09,640
of this training, you're going to have a solid understanding of competition with this business

80
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:14,440
model. And you're going to be able to see the signs, especially the telltale signs of high

81
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:21,160
competition, as well as layups, low competition, areas that if you go into, they're going to be

82
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:26,840
quick wins. They're going to be really high margins, you know, able to rank really quickly,

83
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:31,560
not have to spend a lot of money on ads. I'm going to, I'm confident you'll be able to understand

84
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:37,160
and see those areas. Now, is this going to give you a perfect understanding of competition?

85
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,360
Of course not. I'm not going to be able to do that in the next 40 minutes,

86
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:46,440
but I'm going to be able to give you guys a good 20,000 foot view, enough to have an idea. And then

87
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:51,400
from there, you can build on that. Okay. And again, just for anyone that wasn't on the last

88
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:59,160
couple of calls, guys, these calls, my goal with these calls is to give you value, just like with

89
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,840
the, when we give free leads to a business owner, right? When we call a business owner,

90
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,600
we don't just call them up. Hey, let me, you know, you want to buy some leads? No, that's not what

91
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:10,600
we do. Right. Well, Hey, you want me to rank you on Google? No, that's what everybody does. What do

92
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:15,800
we do? We call them, Hey, let me give you a couple of free leads. And then we can talk. Let's talk

93
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,280
about business after I've given you some free leads, right? We're being different. I'm doing

94
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,440
that with you guys, because I know that you guys, if you're on this call, with the exception of like

95
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:30,120
one or two of you, which I can tell are in, uh, I think, yeah, I think Shane is the only one,

96
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,760
obviously Jason, but Shane's in digital landlords. And by the way, Shane, if you have to hop off,

97
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,520
you're going to get all this, all this stuff anyway. So you don't have to stay on since

98
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:43,000
you're in digital landlords, but, um, everyone else, I know you're interested in this business

99
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,360
model. You're interested in, uh, in, you know, taking the next step and making this a thing,

100
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:53,560
not just something that's a, that's a hobby. Um, I know what you guys are looking for. You're looking

101
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:57,720
for the right information. And so what am I going to do? I'm going to give you that right information,

102
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:03,080
at least a bit of it for free before I ever expect you to work with me, but make no mistake,

103
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:08,600
this is the same as free leads. My goal with my free group is to earn your business. That's,

104
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,360
that's it. Obviously like, okay, I think I'm a pretty decent person, but that's, I'm not,

105
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:17,240
I'm not just doing this out of the goodness of my heart. So that's why I'm doing these calls. Okay.

106
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:21,000
Um, and so it's, it's kind of like this example that I gave a couple of weeks ago.

107
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:29,640
My goal is I'm basically the guy that's trying to get you, um, enough information and enough

108
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:34,120
confidence with this model to get you to the gym, right? If we're talking about the gym,

109
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,240
I'm going to get you there. I'm going to, I'm going to give you enough confidence to go buy

110
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:42,360
a pair of shoes or get a pair of shoes, get the, get to the gym and, and not feel dumb when you're

111
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:47,080
in the gym, right? However, in order for you to have the body you want in order for you to lose

112
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:51,480
the fat you want to build the muscle you want, there's no way I can cover it on these calls.

113
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,240
So that's where we have the program that comes in. Just like you would have to get a trainer,

114
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,600
they would tell you the diet, they would show you that hold your hand. That's the difference,

115
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:04,920
but I will give you enough information, hopefully enough inspiration to take those first steps,

116
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:11,720
get excited and get in the, in the metaphorical gym, so to speak. So here's the plan really quick

117
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,720
about what's going to, this call is going to look like we're going to spend the next 20 minutes,

118
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:22,920
20, probably 20 top, maybe 18 on what I want to cover. Then we're going to open this for Q and A

119
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,560
and I'm probably going to keep it to the comment section, but if we have time,

120
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:30,680
I could also bring you guys on live. And I think that's a really good time. And basically

121
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:35,080
guys, you're, you're basically getting me and there's only what 10 of you on,

122
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:41,160
you're getting me to answer your exact questions. So take advantage of those. And if I can answer

123
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:45,800
it, I will, if I can, I'll be honest with you. Okay. So here's the plan for today's call. Number

124
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:51,160
one is we're going to talk about the factors that actually matter with competition. Number two,

125
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:55,560
we're going to talk about telltale signs of highly competitive areas. Three, we're going to talk about

126
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:03,240
telltale signs of low hanging fruit, AKA layups. Number four, we're going to be talking about what

127
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:10,120
it means and what you should think when you see an Angie's List and home advisor. And then also

128
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:15,880
what to do when you spot, what to do, what to think about when you spot other lead generators.

129
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:20,840
So with that said, let's get right into the call. What I'm going to do really quick. Let me close

130
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:24,040
my door because my kids are still sleeping and then we're going to get, that's going to be two

131
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:38,840
seconds. Okay. So let's go, let's get right into this guys. Again, if you have comments, questions,

132
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:46,840
drop them right now, but take advantage of this guys. It's crazy because I, the reason I do my

133
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:54,440
YouTube channel, the reason I share so much is when I first was getting into this business,

134
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,960
it was so interesting to me. It really caught my attention. I was really excited about it.

135
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,520
There was a podcast that this guy did that was talking about this. And I swear to you guys,

136
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:09,480
I listened to this thing like, I'll say like three times in a month or something like that.

137
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,320
I just couldn't get this out of my head. I wanted more and more and more information.

138
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,920
And the thing that I kept running into is like, I kept asking myself,

139
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:23,240
how do I know like that I should listen to this advice? You know, because this sounds good,

140
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,920
but what is that? And the truth is the person that was actually giving the advice

141
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:31,880
wasn't even in the game anymore. And the most money they'd ever made was like $30,000 in a

142
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:35,720
single month. And come to find out, I don't think that was very months in a row, maybe even just one

143
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:42,120
month in a row. And so I never had somebody who had made a million dollars in this business that

144
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:47,320
I could listen to. Okay. Much less get on a call with 10 or less people and ask questions. So you

145
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:51,320
guys need to take advantage of these calls because I'm literally going to answer any questions that

146
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:57,080
you guys have. Okay. So first things first, let's talk about the factors that actually matter

147
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:01,320
with competition. I'm going to give you the high level. Basically, there's three things.

148
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:05,160
Number one is you need to look at the age of the domain. Number two, you want to look at the

149
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:10,040
content. Number three, you want to look at the backlinks. And I'll add a fourth is you want to

150
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:15,160
look at the cost per click. Okay. Now, how do you discover these things is I'm going to give

151
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:19,000
you a quick little tip. And I think I've talked about this in the free group. There is an extension

152
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:25,000
on Chrome called SEO quake. And you guys can literally just go download that on S on, on

153
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,760
Chrome and enable it. And it will show you, there's a bar that will show you. And if we have time,

154
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:35,160
maybe at the end, I can actually just show you an example, but that's going to actually show you

155
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:41,240
how many backlinks each website has. It's going to give you a quick link to the who is where you

156
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:48,040
can see the age of the domain. And then you obviously can kind of eyeball the content, right?

157
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:55,160
For CPC, you can go use a bunch of different tools. And also with backlinks, guys, the tool,

158
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:03,080
this SEO quake, it's literally called SEO and then Q U A K E. I have it on all of my computers.

159
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:07,400
It's free. And by the way, I always use Chrome. You don't have to, I just found that it's very

160
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:16,040
convenient because the Chrome store anyway, it'll show you how many backlinks. Now, if the area

161
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:23,080
looks competitive, right? And there's a good content, the domains are old, et cetera. You're

162
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:27,240
going to want to go a step further and you're going to want to look at the quality of the backlinks,

163
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:33,640
because it's not about how many backlinks a website has. It's about the quality of the

164
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:37,960
backlinks. And what I mean by that, and that we can do a whole training on backlinks. But

165
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:47,880
if I get a backlink from, let's just say a local review website, right? That's decent. And it might

166
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:52,520
help if I'm building a website in St. George, Utah, because it's a little bit relevant because

167
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:59,800
of it's St. George, right? However, if I compare that to a backlink that I get from, let's say,

168
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:07,080
Forbes, right? Forbes.com gives me a backlink. There's no competition. I would much rather

169
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:11,720
have one backlink from Forbes than a hundred backlinks from all the little review websites

170
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:18,360
in St. George, because the quality, it matters and the quality is much more important in quantity.

171
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:25,640
So guys, number one, age of domain. Number two, content. Number three, backlinks. Number four,

172
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:32,680
CPC. Also as a rule of thumb, make sure I'm going to put this in the notes. Hold on.

173
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:43,960
I'm going to put this in the notes, less than $5. And I could show you guys my Google Ads spending

174
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:49,960
and my average cost over, I don't think I have it on this phone. Maybe I can check out the exact,

175
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:56,840
it's definitely less than $5. Let me see if I have Google Ads here. I don't have it on this phone.

176
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:07,880
So if I pulled this up, my average spend is like $3.50 or $3.70 across $1.5 million spend.

177
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:13,960
If you guys are going into areas, make sure that the cost per click of the main keywords

178
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:19,640
is less than $5. And if it's not, don't do it. Period. I don't care how good it looks,

179
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:24,600
do not do it. Just my two cents. Okay. And what do I know? I've only made millions of dollars

180
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:29,800
doing this. Okay. So that's the factors that actually matter. Okay. And if you have questions,

181
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:33,640
these are perfect questions to ask here in about 10 minutes when we have questions. Okay.

182
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:38,120
Number two, what are the telltale signs of a highly competitive area?

183
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,720
Here's, I'm just going to give you, this is the thing, this is kind of the litmus test.

184
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:51,080
If I see this, I just don't even touch it. Okay. And what it is guys is when you guys are looking

185
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:55,000
at an area, because what you want to do is if you pick a city, you pick a niche, you have to make

186
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,400
sure that you're going to be able to get in and rank the website. Because if you can't get in and

187
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:04,200
rank the website, then this business model isn't what this business model is. This is a rank and

188
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:08,440
rent business model, right? You need to be able to get in, rank the website so that the calls become

189
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:13,320
free and the margins become fat. And so if I look at an area, let's just say Las Vegas concrete.

190
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:17,400
So that's an easy example to use. If I look at Las Vegas concrete, there's a lot of, you know,

191
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:21,720
we know the niche works. We know there's a lot of people searching for concrete because it's a big

192
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:28,920
population, but I look at it and it's really competitive. And it's going to be in the websites

193
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:34,040
that are at the top of Google are really good websites. They have old domains. They have

194
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:41,080
really good content. They have good backlinks. Even though there's a good opportunity. Once I

195
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:47,320
rank, I have to be honest with myself and go, what are the actual chances of me ranking? How

196
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:53,160
much work is it actually going to take for me to rank? And is it going to be worth the squeeze?

197
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:57,160
And that those are the questions that you have to ask yourself, because sometimes as good as it is,

198
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:01,080
it's not worth it guys. There are businesses that are really good out there. You know,

199
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:06,680
that's what's a really good business is solar. I have friends. I have a neighbor slash friend.

200
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:11,960
It also my kids football coach. He makes a lot of money and he does solar, but he got into the

201
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:16,760
right area at the right time and he's been doing it for 10 years. And so if I look at solar and

202
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:22,600
I'm like, I'm just going to get into it. It's so competitive right now. Yeah, I could, I could,

203
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,200
but you know how much, you know, how much competition is in that business. It's insane,

204
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:31,880
right? Roofing also a good business, but it's a very competitive business, right? So we have

205
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:37,960
to look at those things. So a telltale sign that it's a very highly competitive area is you always

206
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:42,920
want to search. You always want to clear your browsing history and you want to search for the

207
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:47,160
main keywords. And that's a whole nother training in itself is what are the main keywords? How do

208
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:51,960
you build a keyword list? How do you know what your core keyword list, all these things we cover,

209
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:56,120
obviously in depth of the training, but we have covered in bits and pieces inside of the Facebook

210
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:59,960
group that you guys can go search. But once you get your core keyword list, you want to clear

211
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:04,600
your browsing history because you want it to be a fresh search as if you're somebody who's never

212
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:10,520
searched before. And you want to search all these terms. So concrete Las Vegas, concrete contractor,

213
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:16,360
Las Vegas, concrete company, Las Vegas, concrete sidewalk, Las Vegas, concrete walkway or driveway,

214
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:20,840
Las Vegas, right? Las Vegas, Nevada, all these things we want to just, we want to do multiple.

215
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:24,840
This is one of the things that they didn't teach me in my first training. I didn't realize that

216
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:31,240
you should probably search more than one keyword. I was the dummy that was typing towing Huntsville.

217
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:36,200
And I would, I would literally made my decision based on that. I looked at the term towing

218
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:40,200
Huntsville. I searched it. It looked decent. I didn't even really know what I was looking at.

219
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:46,760
And I based my entire decision of going into towing Huntsville on one term. And that's it.

220
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:52,200
And literally I got so lucky that it actually was low-hanging fruit. I didn't do it. It wasn't

221
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:57,160
because I was good. It wasn't because I knew what I was doing. I just got lucky, right? But guys,

222
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:02,360
you have to look at multiple terms because let's say that towing Huntsville or Las Vegas concrete

223
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:07,800
is very easy to rank for, right? There's not much competition, blah, blah, blah. But let's say

224
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:14,440
Las Vegas concrete contractors is highly competitive. Las Vegas concrete company is

225
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:20,360
highly competitive. Concrete sidewalk is highly competitive. Then out of all the terms that I want

226
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:26,120
to rank for out of seven terms, only one of them looks feasible. I'm not going into that area. So

227
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:30,120
you have to look at more than one. So here's the deal is once you search, once you number one,

228
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:34,840
figure out ability keyword list, and you have that keyword list, you're going to search for those

229
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:40,680
keywords with the area. Okay. At the end of it. So Las Vegas concrete or concrete Las Vegas plus

230
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,960
the other seven terms. And I'm going to have all the tabs pulled up to what I usually do.

231
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,600
Then what I'm going to do is I'm going to pull all those up and I'm going to look,

232
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:53,320
this is just a quick way. And I don't know why this is the case, but I can almost

233
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:59,880
always guarantee that when this happens, it's highly competitive. Okay. If you start looking

234
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:04,520
at all, let's say you open the first tab and you, what I always do is I look at who's actually in

235
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:10,680
the maps. Okay. Now I don't spend a bunch of time in maps to this day. I have kind of just

236
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:16,920
set it aside. If I can always try to get the map, the Google, my business, but I don't spend time

237
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:21,320
obsessing over it because I realized if I can rank organically and I can get my ads running,

238
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:25,080
I don't need the maps. The maps is a bonus. So for those of you that think you need map,

239
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:29,560
but you don't. Okay. Promise you, I built a million dollar company without even

240
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:33,960
worrying about maps. In fact, most, most of my projects, when I hit the million dollar mark in

241
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:40,040
2020 did not even have Google GMBs. Okay. You don't need them. You can make a million dollars

242
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:47,560
without them. That's a fact. Okay. But so, but for whatever reason, there is a strong correlation

243
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:52,680
between who's ranking in the maps and who's ranking organically. And so what I look at guys

244
00:21:52,680 --> 00:22:00,360
is I go and I open all the tabs and I look at who's the number one in the maps. Okay. Let's say it's

245
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:06,040
Bob's concrete. Okay. Then I'm going to open up second tab is Bob's concrete in the maps. Yes.

246
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:12,200
Okay. Is it in the same spot? Okay. Bob's concrete is ranked the first, the first listing in the maps

247
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,720
for the first two terms. And I'm going to look at the third and I'm looking at the fourth and I'm

248
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:21,000
going to look at all seven or all five. I would say minimum five up to seven keywords. And guys,

249
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:27,720
I'm going to do that. And I'm going to look at if that Bob's concrete is ranking for the majority

250
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:31,880
of those terms in the same spot in the maps. Okay. And I'm going to do that. I'm going to see

251
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:35,720
what the main, like what are the main companies ranking in the maps? Now, again, I just said,

252
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:40,120
we're not worried too much about math, but for some reason, this is a strong indicator

253
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:44,760
of a highly competitive area. Once I do that, guys, I'm going to go and I'm going to look at

254
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:49,720
those same exact terms. I'm going to open those tabs back up and I'm going to look who's ranking

255
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:55,320
organically. If you're brand new and you don't know what I'm talking about underneath the maps

256
00:22:55,320 --> 00:23:00,520
is the organic section, the actual listings, right? So now I'm going to look who's ranking

257
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:04,760
on page one and at the top of page one. So I'm going to go, okay, Bob's concrete.

258
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:11,640
He ranked in the maps, number one for five out of the seven terms. And he's ranking number one

259
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:17,480
for five of the terms and number two on page one for two of the terms. This guy's basically glued

260
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:21,720
to the top. I'm going to make a mental note and I'm going to go to the next one. That's Sally's

261
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:27,320
concrete. And we do the same thing and we go to the next one. Okay. If you guys see the same three

262
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:32,440
companies showing up over and over and over for the majority of the terms, if you're doing seven

263
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:36,760
and that's four of them, or if you're doing five and there's three of them and the same three

264
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:44,840
companies are showing up for the majority of those terms. Okay. Number one and B, if those companies

265
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:51,320
are also showing up on the organic on page one, especially at the top for the majority of the

266
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:57,560
keywords, you need to get the heck out of there. I don't care how low the CPC is. I don't care how

267
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:03,720
bad you want to do it. Do not do it. And for whatever reason, and this is my theory is that

268
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:08,280
Google wants to give the business to the local guys. We're the ones that spend the freaking money

269
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:12,200
with Google ads. We're the ones. And when I say local, I'm representing the local guy, right?

270
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,440
Even though I don't own the concrete company, I am representing the local concrete company.

271
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,880
They know that we're the ones that are going to always be there. We have to, we need Google. We're

272
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:26,280
the ones that are going to spend the money on Google ads, et cetera. They would like to give

273
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:32,760
the spots to the local guy. They really would. And I truly like think that, and that's, we're

274
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:37,480
going to get into some others, some, when we talk about home advisor, I think if they can,

275
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:44,360
they like to give it to local. So if I see people that are ranking again and again and again in the

276
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:49,480
maps, they're also ranking organically. It's basically like Google telling us out loud,

277
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:55,880
Hey, I've chosen my people, man. These are my recommended people. And when people search in

278
00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:01,960
this city, they've proven that they're the guys, they're the gals. And for whatever reason, guys,

279
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:06,120
if you see those same companies showing up again and again in the maps and also showing up

280
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:12,120
organically, especially at the top, it's too competitive. Especially if you don't have any

281
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:16,200
money coming in, especially if you haven't gotten out of your job. Now, if you've gone and you're

282
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:20,920
at like Jason, Jason, Jason, what did you just hit by the way in your agency? What are you at per month?

283
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:29,800
Cool story. I, I closed three deals in the last seven days. So that's crazy. I closed two deals

284
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:35,240
last night. So we're at almost 14,000, three, we're at 13,000 right now, but closer to the

285
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:41,080
$14,000 range. Sick dude. Once we get off that call, this call, I want you to post that in the

286
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:46,040
group, in the free group, because it just inspires people. By the way, Jason, when did you start

287
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:52,680
this business? Like a year ago? Yeah, much less than a year ago. I actually didn't get my

288
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:58,600
head underwatered, like actually diving straight into this business model until the end of January

289
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:03,880
of this year. That's dope, dude. For, and, and just real quick, this is one of his calls about, but

290
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:11,480
did you, were you previously in digital marketing? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I did SEO.

291
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:18,200
You did SEO and you decided to convert to this? Yeah. So I'm sure a lot of you guys have found

292
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:23,480
Nick's YouTube channel, right? Everything makes so much sense. So if any of you guys come from

293
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:31,240
RankinRent or SEO, this business model makes so much sense. And it's all, it's all paid off.

294
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:36,280
Literally, all I do is I just follow Nick's steps that he's laid out for me. The next thing I know,

295
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:42,280
I'm on a closing call and a guy's handing over his credit card. It's really that simple.

296
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:49,080
14K, that's, that's, that's amazing, bro. Good job. I didn't even know that. So congrats on the 14K.

297
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:53,400
Thanks, man. And I think you could probably be a testament that like,

298
00:26:53,400 --> 00:27:03,080
when I found this as well, guys, when there's a process that works, if you just follow it,

299
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:06,920
it works. And if it works once, it's going to work again. And I don't know if you noticed

300
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:11,720
that Jason, but like, when you first follow the process, it's almost like, you almost don't

301
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:16,760
believe it can be that simple. I'm not saying easy. I'm saying simple. Right. And you follow

302
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:22,360
it and it works. You're like, no way. Right. And, and he just do it again and again. And then

303
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,640
I promise you, and I'm begging you, Jason, because everyone does this. I think you might

304
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,920
have even gone through this already, but, and then everyone gets too smart and they,

305
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:32,200
they try too early to innovate. There's nothing wrong with innovation, but if it works,

306
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:39,800
it's like, okay, Jason's got to $14,000 per month. So why not just go do that eight more times?

307
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:44,360
Like you, you know what I mean? Or when I go to that, you know, you do that four more times,

308
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:48,520
you're at $60,000 a month. You're probably with, with the profit margin, you're probably making

309
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:52,600
close to, you know, half a million dollars a year in your pocket, you know, but we get too

310
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:57,160
smart and we're like, oh, I'm going to go learn Facebook ads or whatever. But yeah, just, I mean,

311
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:03,400
have you seen, and you could completely disagree, but what I've seen is that when you have a process

312
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:08,440
that works and you follow it, you just follow it exactly to a T because the person that's teaching

313
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:12,440
you it, as long as they're credible, they're saying the things they're saying for a reason.

314
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:21,080
Yeah, yeah, for sure. One thing I can say also is even though I have all of your resources in front

315
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:26,600
of me, sometimes like I was getting on a roll, right? So there was a few steps that I decided,

316
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:31,640
oh, I, I got this, like, I'm not going to apply this step, you know, this should be a lay down and,

317
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:38,120
and I lost the deal because I wasn't listening to that one thing Nick was telling me to do,

318
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:41,800
whatever it is, there were so many things throughout the process that,

319
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:45,400
you know, to be honest, I feel like I should be at $20,000 per month

320
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,840
because I chose to ignore certain things that you were telling me to do.

321
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:54,040
So it's, it's not, it requires a lot of hard work, but you have to do

322
00:28:55,240 --> 00:29:00,120
things correctly. You can't just go out there and just ask somebody to hand you their money or

323
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:03,960
take these free leads and work with me. Like you have to qualify the business owner

324
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:09,480
that there's a whole thorough process that you have to go through with vetting your business owner

325
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:13,320
and qualifying them before they even waste your time in the first place.

326
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:21,560
Yeah. And it's just like, I've used this example. It's like having the perfect recipe for the

327
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:27,960
perfect chocolate cake, right? It, you know, you can go and try to put the sugar in at a different

328
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:32,760
time and you're just risk it. You make, you could try to use a different brand of sugar. You could

329
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:37,480
try to use brown sugar instead of white sugar. You could try to whatever for glow the flower.

330
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:42,120
But if you just follow the recipe, the perfect cake is going to come out. If you decide not

331
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:45,800
to follow it, then you're, you don't know. And you're just kind of up in the air. So

332
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:51,640
anyway, appreciate you, you jumping in on that. This Salim guy, you can just remove him because

333
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:56,520
he's too late to the call. That's in the waiting. Oh, he, he said that he had a license issue.

334
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:02,520
So you can let him in, you can let him in. Okay. Okay. Real quick. Telltale signs that we're going

335
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:09,080
to get into questions that everybody has. So guys, on the other hand, what are the telltale signs

336
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:13,560
of low hanging fruit? What are the telltale signs of a layup? What are the telltale signs? If I see

337
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:19,560
this thing, I'm going in no matter what. And that is really, really simple. It's two things. Number

338
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:24,360
one is it's the opposite of what I just explained, which means if you do your, your research, if you

339
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:29,080
clear your browsing history, you search your five to seven terms and you see that the companies in

340
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:34,040
the maps are completely scattered. It's different companies. It's Bob, then it's Sally, then it's

341
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:40,840
Frank, then it's Las Vegas concrete. Then it's super concrete and they're all different. And

342
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:45,400
underneath in the organic, they're all different. And most of them are on page two or on page three.

343
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:51,480
And it's just a big jumble, mumble, jumble. That's a good sign. That's a, a strong indicator

344
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:57,080
that it's actually not competitive because it's not consistent. And so basically the way I view

345
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:01,240
it is Google's trying to figure out who the best person is. And for each term, they're kind of

346
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:07,000
sending people to different companies. And so whenever I see a scattering or I see that there's

347
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,600
a bunch of different companies showing up in the maps and there's no consistency and there's no one

348
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:15,240
company that's dominating. I love that. That gets me really excited. That's number one. Number two,

349
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:20,680
this is when I get really excited is if you guys are searching your terms, you search your seven

350
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:27,240
terms, okay, your five terms, concrete, concrete contractors, concrete company, et cetera. And you

351
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:34,600
have at least one company in the, in the maps that's showing up consistently for the top three

352
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:41,880
across all the terms. And that company does not have a website. Okay. And what I mean by that is

353
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:48,600
it is possible to get a Google my business or Google business profile and get it ranked

354
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:55,000
and not even have a website. It is possible. And if you come across this guys and you see it's that,

355
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:02,520
that one, let's say it's, let's say it's called a Las Vegas, Las Vegas, number one concrete company.

356
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:08,360
That's the listing and they're showing up for all seven terms, all seven terms they're showing up

357
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:13,800
for. Okay. In the maps and you look and you go and you're like, wait, where's their website?

358
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:18,120
And it's, they don't even have a website. It's literally doesn't even have a link for a website.

359
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:24,440
It's just a listing guys. I can tell you I'm, I'm going into that. I'm going into it. Cause I know

360
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:28,680
that I'm going to be able to rank that pretty dang quickly. And I'll tell you an example of when I

361
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:37,640
did this, um, I had this client in, uh, in, in St. George and I can't, I can't even remember,

362
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:43,320
but it was in a specific niche and I was doing the research in a city called Cedar city,

363
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:48,760
which is about 45 minutes to an hour north of here. And I just, for fun, I went, I did all the

364
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:55,080
terms and guys, I think it was not only one, but I think two of the top three didn't have websites

365
00:32:55,080 --> 00:33:00,680
for all the terms. And literally I don't believe in rank and rent. I truly do not believe in rank

366
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:05,000
and rent because I think it's a waste of time, but I was, I've done this enough that when I saw it,

367
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:11,240
I also had enough search volume. It also had low CPC and I already had a client because I had that

368
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:15,720
client in St. George. I knew they'd buy the leads in Cedar city. I just went and I called Francesca

369
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:20,600
or I text her, I slacked her and I said, Hey, buy the domain for Cedar city, whatever.com

370
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:24,200
build the website. She's like, are you sure? We usually do the one page. I'm like, no,

371
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:28,920
just build a website. We built a website, no backlinks, nothing did. We did our rate,

372
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:33,320
everything else normal, just how we know what we did, you know, sound SEO. We built it within

373
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:37,720
three months. That thing was completely glued to the top and it stayed there. Okay. And I, and,

374
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:43,720
and so I'm telling you guys, if you see the, the same company showing up over and over and over

375
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:49,160
in the maps for the top three, for the main search terms, and they have no website, that's a really

376
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:54,760
good sign. You should get excited because it's going to be relatively easy to rank. Okay. Last

377
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:59,080
two things. What does it mean? We see a home advisor and Angie's list. It means it's, it's,

378
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:03,080
it's a good thing. Okay. It's a good thing. Don't get scared. Don't think, oh my gosh,

379
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:07,720
it's home advisor. It's Angie's list. No, the reason why it's good is because guys,

380
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:13,000
if you see home advisor, that means that especially obviously home advisor is going to be in the,

381
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,720
in the organic underneath the maps. If you see home advisor showing up for every one of the search

382
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:26,120
terms, what that means is that home advisor is ranking their page over everyone else's website.

383
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:30,920
What I mean by that is it's homeadvisor.com forward slash Kansas city or forward slash

384
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:35,720
concrete slash Kansas. I don't know what their, their structure is, but whatever their link

385
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:42,440
structure is, it's, they're, they're ranking a page over a website. And that, that is defying

386
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:48,200
logic, which means like, it's always easier to rank a website. If I have a, you know, let's call

387
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:54,360
it a Las Vegas concrete.com. And I am, I am targeting Las Vegas only, and I'm targeting

388
00:34:54,360 --> 00:35:02,120
concrete only. And I'm going against somebody who is, you know, best concrete contractor.com

389
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:09,080
forward slash Las Vegas. They're trying to rank their single page against my domain. And I have a,

390
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:14,280
I have an advantage. And so if I see that home advisor is ranking for all the terms, I don't

391
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:19,800
run. I love, I actually prefer. So if you guys see home advisor, Angela's showing up at the top of

392
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:26,840
Google, good sign. Okay. Lastly, guys is what to do, what to do when you spot another lead gen.

393
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:33,400
I had this completely backwards. I thought that if I saw another lead gen, I got so upset. I was

394
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:40,200
like, oh my gosh, that's saturated. This business model, guys, this is back in 2016, 17, 18, 19.

395
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:43,640
I was thinking this. If I saw another lead generator, it completely put me off. And I was

396
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:47,960
like, gosh dang it. I should have come here earlier. I missed my, my, you know, I missed

397
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:53,080
my window, all these different things. And then one day, and I've told the story before,

398
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,080
and by the way, it's the last story I'm going to tell them. We're going to get the Q and A.

399
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:58,360
We have 10 minutes. If you guys have questions, drop them in the comments or yeah. In the comments

400
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:05,560
section is I'm looking at St. George tree service. Okay. And I look at it and I find another lead

401
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:10,520
generator and I'm like, gosh freaking dang it. I was late to the game. So I'm like, all right,

402
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:14,360
I'm going to go. I'm going to figure out who it is. I go, I do the who is, and they didn't buy

403
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:18,760
the privacy. So I could, I found their name and I'm like, let me just look. And I looked in one of

404
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:22,520
my Facebook groups because I could tell it was a website. It looked really similar to mine. So I

405
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:27,160
looked at the Facebook group for that name. Sure enough, I could, I found their, their Facebook

406
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:33,240
profile. I got, I'm sure I could still find the Facebook messages. So I find the Facebook profile

407
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:37,400
and I'm like, before I give up on this, let me just reach out to this person and see if they're

408
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:42,840
because what I did before that guys is I called the website to see if it actually had a client,

409
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:46,040
right? I didn't call. I didn't click on their ads because they weren't running ads.

410
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:50,840
I clicked on it. I called and nobody answered. And I did that a couple of times. I was like, dude,

411
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:54,840
no one's buying these leads. They're not even touching this website and it's ranking.

412
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:59,000
That's when I reached out and I was like, Hey, my name's Nick, blah, blah, blah. I'm in the same

413
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,320
program. Would you be interested in selling your, your website? Like don't no disrespect,

414
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:10,440
but I'd love to buy it or talk, talk numbers. And basically this person, they basically got offended

415
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:15,880
and told me, you know, to go eat sand. And I don't know what it was. And maybe I was having

416
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:21,880
a bad day, whatever, but I just literally out of spite, I was like, you know what? Screw them.

417
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,680
If you're not going to sell me your website and you don't even have a client, I'm going to build

418
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:31,080
one anyway. And I'm going to go get a client. And keep in mind at the time we were just now starting

419
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:36,520
to do rent than rank. I was running ads. So I had this like confidence that, Hey, we can do this in

420
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:42,280
the city. And I guys, I confidently went into St. George and I landed a client. It was just about

421
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:47,800
a week after COVID started. I sent a couple of leads, met this guy to coffee shop, totally did

422
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:53,320
everything wrong. He went and talked to his wife, but because I had sent them the leads and I,

423
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:57,480
that's when I realized the power of sending leads, by the way that he called me, his name was Tony.

424
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:01,880
He's like, dude, let's do this. I met him at a Maverick, which is a gas station because it was

425
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:09,640
COVID outside, literally signed a contract over the hood and had these guys for over three years

426
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:13,400
before they went a different direction over three years. And I made here, I'll tell you right now,

427
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:22,600
if I can, if I can pull it up real quick. Oh, by the way, this is nice. I made two, I made

428
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:29,160
just 150, not much, but I made $150 at 205, which I always love because I love making money when

429
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:37,000
I'm sleeping. It always feels good. Hold on tree service. Let me see if I can find this company

430
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:44,840
and tell you guys exactly how much I have made from this website that I almost didn't go into

431
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:50,840
St. George tree service right there. Where are you at, bro? Okay. St. George tree service leads.

432
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:55,960
It might not let me, it's going to make me sign in. Hold on. Let me do one more thing. It's called,

433
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:02,600
um, hold on. I would love to tell you guys the exact amount of money I've made. I just

434
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:10,760
want to tell you guys how freaking much I would have lost out on if companies, where's that?

435
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:19,160
Okay. It's not going to let me. Anyway, I know it's, it's well over $20,000 point being is I

436
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:24,120
almost didn't go into it because I saw another lead generator. I went in, not only did I go in,

437
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:27,640
I got a client. It was over a thousand dollars a month, had them for over three years. So yeah,

438
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:32,280
I would have made way more than that. I would have made, uh, over $30,000 and I can find the

439
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:36,440
number for you, but for some reason, like I, it's the mobile is kind of hard to find. So anyway,

440
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:40,760
guys, um, when you see other lead generators, what the point is treat them as if they're just

441
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:44,760
another business, right? As if you didn't know what a lead gen site looked like, as if it's just

442
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:50,440
another Sally's concrete, Mark's concrete, Jack's concrete, look at the age of the domain, look at

443
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:57,080
the content, look at the backlinks and treat it like any other website. And if it's still is low

444
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:02,920
competition, then go into it. Who cares? Just because I have a lead generation site and I have

445
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:06,760
a client doesn't mean you can guys. I just barely did a YouTube video on Bentonville concrete,

446
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:11,160
like a couple of weeks ago, maybe a week ago. I think it was a couple of weeks ago. And as I'm

447
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:16,120
doing the video live, I noticed that the number two result is a lead gen site. So somebody took

448
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:21,400
my advice. They're like, Hey, this guy has a, uh, a project. This guy has a client, but why can't I

449
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:27,480
go in have be number two and go and get a client too. And I don't know if they have a client,

450
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:31,240
but they have a website that's ranking and I'm sure they're getting leads. So just because you

451
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:35,480
see a lead gen site does not mean it's kind of, it's completely competitive. And so that's the

452
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:38,520
truth. And that's the things you want to cover. So guys, what we covered today, which we're going

453
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:44,440
to use this outline to create the digital resource that we're going to set up. So those of you that

454
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:49,240
are on here in the next seven minutes, um, is number one, what are the factors that matter?

455
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:52,680
Number two, the telltale signs of a highly competitive area. Number three, the telltale

456
00:40:52,680 --> 00:41:01,720
signs of a low hanging fruit slash a layup area, a gimme a lay down. Um, what also, what it means

457
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:06,200
when you see home advisor and Angie's list, when they're ranking and what, what, what it means when

458
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:11,480
you spot other lead gens and what you should do. So that said, guys, are there any comments,

459
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:17,000
any questions? Jason, if you wouldn't mind, can you go ahead and open that up? And if there are,

460
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:22,600
let's go through those really quick. Yeah. Yeah. We got a few here. Um, let's see.

461
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:29,480
So Joel asks, did your view of competition change from your earlier years compared to now?

462
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:35,160
If so, how? Yeah, because my, I didn't know what proper competition looked like. I didn't have

463
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:42,040
a formula for proper competition. Guys, if you don't know what to look, what, what, um, metrics

464
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:47,640
to look at, if you don't know what a good area looks like, you, you can't even do this business

465
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:55,080
model. Like my, the training I first got, it taught me a lot of basics. It taught me so many good

466
00:41:55,080 --> 00:42:00,360
things and I, I, I spent $8,000 on it. I made a lot of money from it because I taught me things

467
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:05,000
I had to learn. I had to learn how to do content. I had all these different things,

468
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:11,160
but I'm going to be honest, the due diligence process, the competition, you know, assessment

469
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:16,120
part, it was terrible. It was absolutely terrible. It didn't teach me this. So yeah,

470
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:21,160
it's completely changed and I learned it through trial and error. So, um, basically how it's

471
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:28,520
changed is, is I now look at age of domain content, backlinks, and then CPC is something

472
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:33,400
that I can't believe I never looked at. Like, and the reason why guys is the higher the CPC,

473
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:37,960
typically the more competitive it is. And if you're not, and the other thing is if you're

474
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:42,440
not looking at CPC, you're crazy because let's just say that winter comes and things dry up or

475
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:48,040
things slow down or your website, heaven forbid gets, gets pushed to page two or page three for,

476
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:53,160
for some weird Google update. I want to make sure that if I kick on ads tomorrow to supplement,

477
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:58,040
I'm not going to lose my shorts. So that, I mean, the other before I wasn't even thinking

478
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:02,440
about CPC. Now it's a, it's a huge metric that I look at. So anyway, keep going.

479
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:10,520
Yeah, yeah, for sure. Um, so Chris asks, what are your ballparking,

480
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:13,640
what are you ballparking for CPC, um, for the UK?

481
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:21,160
Um, I've never done CPC in the UK, but my, what I would tell you is, you know, obviously less

482
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:24,920
than $5 because that's what you do in the US, but I would, I would say that you could probably

483
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:30,840
safely do less than you could probably shave a dollar, maybe a dollar 50 off, because I know

484
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:36,760
that it's not as competitive. Um, but if you want to be ultra safe, then I would do less than $5

485
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:40,520
in the UK. Just to say,

486
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:48,200
if he's using the pounds. Oh, what is pounds? Yeah, just convert it. I don't know. I'll tell

487
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:52,920
you right now. Yeah, just, just convert it, Chris. Five USD, two pounds.

488
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:06,760
3.85. So anything 3.85 or less, 3.85 pounds or less per click. You're good to go.

489
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:10,840
Cool. Swing. Yeah, no problem. Thanks man. Good question.

490
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:19,880
Uh, let's see, uh, Salim, uh, you said you have a tree service site in San Jose. Nick was talking

491
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:24,680
about St. George, Utah. I think you're talking about San Jose, California. So completely different

492
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:29,960
areas. We actually don't even recommend going into California, to be honest. Don't do it.

493
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:35,160
Don't do it again. This is just coming from experience. I'm like that old grandpa. That's

494
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:39,560
like, you know, that gives you that wisdom. And they're like, yeah, when I was a kid and you think

495
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:43,000
they're full of crap and tell you like, go and try it. And they're like, Oh, grandpa was right.

496
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:52,520
Don't do California, man. I feel exhausted. Like I, I don't even have energy to like really talk

497
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,760
about it because we talked about it. I have a YouTube video about it.

498
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,680
There's too much money out there to be wasted time in California.

499
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:08,200
Yeah, for sure. Uh, Shane Noble says, Nick, do you use SEO Quake for content?

500
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:15,000
Where do you get CPC metrics or the keyword planner? CPC, I've always used SEMrush.

501
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:21,320
However, I think if you've been on my last two, cause you're, he's an indigenous landlord.

502
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:29,000
The last two weeks, I've kind of talked about it is we've been working for the last year on

503
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:35,480
putting something together. That's going to be our like go-to golden standard thing. I've put

504
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:43,080
over, we put over $50,000 into this thing and we're testing it right now. Um, so for right now,

505
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:49,000
until I show you what I'm talking about, you could use SEMrush. Um, that's what we usually,

506
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,800
that's typically what I'm referring to. That's what I've used in the past.

507
00:45:54,360 --> 00:46:00,760
Yeah, I'm excited for that. Uh, Saleem says, do you suggest using EMD or going, uh,

508
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:04,760
some other relevant names for domain name? Okay. So for those that don't know what he means

509
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:12,120
about EMD is exact match domain. Um, you know, St. George concrete, St. George plumbing, whatever

510
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:20,360
Las Vegas concrete or concrete Las Vegas. Um, yeah, I don't, I try to get it in, but you know,

511
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:25,560
I don't stress a bunch. So like I do, I still try to get it in. So if I, I always look at,

512
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:30,840
you know, Las Vegas concrete, second option would be concrete Las Vegas. Third option would be,

513
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:39,240
uh, concrete hyphen Las Vegas. Uh, then it would probably be concrete hyphen

514
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:45,800
loss hyphen vague. I try to keep it in, but I don't think it ultimately is that big of a factor

515
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:50,840
that again, guys, if you look, if you find a city that's low hanging fruit and you do the due

516
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:57,880
diligence and it's not competitive, that isn't that technically Google says that exact match domain

517
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:04,920
isn't a factor anymore, but I don't agree. I think it does matter a little bit. And so if you're

518
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:10,600
going into a highly competitive area, all the tiny things matter, but if you're going into an area

519
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:16,760
that's not competitive, you can get away with a lot. So my, my recommendation is spend the time

520
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:22,200
to find a low hanging fruit area, find one of those telltale signs, those map listings without

521
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:27,160
a website. And then guess what? The exact match domain doesn't really matter. Okay. But technically

522
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:31,000
Google says it doesn't matter. I still try to get it, but I don't, I'm not too fussy about it.

523
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:35,480
I don't have to have an exact match domain, but I do try to get at least the keyword in, at least

524
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:43,240
the city without making it look spammy. Yep. Yeah, for sure. Um, and then she noble says,

525
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:51,000
have you done any YouTube on CPC? Um, I'm going to write this down. I was going to just think

526
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:57,400
about making a YouTube on exact match. Um, CPC, I don't know if I've done it too much on that,

527
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:03,960
but I can Shane. That's a good, that's a good suggestion. I can make a video on CPC. In fact,

528
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:10,600
what I'd like you to do, Shane, send me a DM with Jason or Donnie Drake. He's also, he's got two

529
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:16,200
names. Um, send us a DM with your exact question related to CPC. I'll make a YouTube video this

530
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:20,520
week. I'll post it and I'll send it to you, uh, directly to answer your question and also be able

531
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:25,640
to, um, have it as a good, you know, piece of information for anyone else has a question.

532
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:32,600
Also Shane, uh, you're, you're part of digital landlords. Um, I feel like Nick goes over that

533
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:36,200
pretty well in the training. If you need to go through and review the training or ask people

534
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:41,880
in the paid group, um, you know, people can help you out there too. So, and also by the way,

535
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:46,600
I'm going to cover this tomorrow on digital. We're actually doing, we're rehauling the whole

536
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:51,800
training on ads, which is exciting. I'm pretty pumped about that. But, um, so yeah, Shane,

537
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:55,160
that's what I would do. I'm happy to make a YouTube video about it. Number one, number two,

538
00:48:55,160 --> 00:49:01,720
like you said, I know this, we've covered it in, in detail, um, in the training and also in the

539
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:06,680
different threads within the group. Um, but yeah, and you could also ask that question to digital

540
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:09,800
landlords. And then me and, um, Jason can go answer it there as well.

541
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:19,320
Yeah. Um, we got, we got one more, I think, uh, Joel, on average, how long has it taken you to

542
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:25,720
rank aside with ads in a low competition area? Um, have you already screenshot this that people

543
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:29,880
are on by the way? No, I haven't. You should be done really quick and I'll answer this. We can

544
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:34,440
hop off to screenshot everyone with their name. And anyone's on this call is going to get a DM

545
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:40,520
from, uh, Donnie Dre, which is Jason. He's going to DM you the digital resource that we create from

546
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:45,560
this call. So appreciate you guys being on. Um, this is, I guess my gift to you for just being on

547
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:51,240
and then you'd have to take a bunch of notes and, uh, we're going to create that today. Um, average

548
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:58,040
for me, if I do good research is, is four to six months. Um, but there's always anomalies. There's

549
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:01,720
always times you go in and you surprise yourself and you get something to rank. I've had stuff

550
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:06,200
rank in a month. I've also had stuff that looked like everything else and it took me nine months.

551
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:10,040
So you can only control what you can control. But guess what? The beautiful thing is,

552
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:15,720
is if you're running ads, you're making money the entire freaking time. And so you don't sit

553
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:18,920
there and obsessing, not sitting there. Oh, where am I ranked? Where am I ranked? Where am I? Right?

554
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:22,680
Where's the lead? You don't even worry guys. You just go and you make money and you get the next

555
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:25,480
one, you get the next one, you get the next one. And the thing I love about it, like Jason, for

556
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:32,760
example, you know, he's making 14 grand a month, but his margins, because he's running ads to keep,

557
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:37,800
I'm guessing most of those afloat, his margin is the lowest it's ever going to be. Let's say it's

558
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:41,800
50% right now because he's spent, he's got some that are ranking. He's got a lot of these doing

559
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:48,280
ads for, let's just say he's making 7,000 net. It's the lowest it's going to be. And what he's

560
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:51,640
going to realize if he hasn't already is he's going to look at that. He's going to sit down one day

561
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:56,440
and go, oh my gosh, if I just focus on SEO, if I just focus on getting this rank so I can turn off

562
00:50:56,440 --> 00:51:03,080
ads, I can go from making 7,000 in my pocket to making 12,000 in my pocket. And that's like the

563
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:06,440
coolest thing because you don't have to call any business owners. You just have to focus on

564
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:12,520
technical stuff, which is the easy part. And you can make $5,000 more per month in your pocket,

565
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:17,240
which is what a lot of people get paid per year at their job. So yeah, for sure.

566
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:23,800
One thing I noticed too is like, I'm just focusing on just getting that next deal,

567
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:27,720
hooking the next business owner. And the next thing I know a lead comes in organically and I'm

568
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:32,680
like, Hey, this isn't from the ads. I go take a look and this guy's number two on Google already.

569
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:38,360
I have three or four guys who are already at the top of Google without adding a single backlink,

570
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:43,320
to be honest. So just let it do its thing and focus on closing the next deal.

571
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:48,840
And that means Jason, that you did really good due diligence. If you're ranking without backlinks,

572
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:53,960
that's because you did a really good due diligence. So that's the truth. Guys,

573
00:51:53,960 --> 00:52:00,120
thanks for being on the call as always. And guys, hopefully you guys listen to what Jason's saying.

574
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:05,880
Jason, for those that didn't hear this, it started in January, just like this year.

575
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:10,920
He's already at 14,000. This works for everybody. If you follow the process,

576
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:14,840
it works for everybody. And so when he's in there as Donnie Dre, if he's given advice,

577
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:20,120
he's actually doing this. That's kind of a rule. If somebody's on my team, they have to be doing

578
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:25,160
the business model. They have to have already closed deals. Because if not, imagine Jason's

579
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:31,960
on this call and he's just speaking from theory. So anyway, if you guys see his post, know that

580
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:36,120
he knows what he's doing. But that said, guys, thank you so much. We'll see you guys inside the

581
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:40,600
free group and we'll see you next week. Thanks, Jason. See you guys.
