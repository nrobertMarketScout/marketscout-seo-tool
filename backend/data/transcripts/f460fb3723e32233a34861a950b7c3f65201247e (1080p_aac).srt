00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,920
On the screencast section, this one's easy because I always, if you guys know from my trip, from the trainings that you've watched, is I'm always like my tabs, I'm showing other areas.

2
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:17,040
Right. And so instead of just showing, hey, here's, here's the company that I work with in St. George, Utah.

3
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:23,320
That's good. But better is here's a guy that I work with in St. George. His name is Joe Brady.

4
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:28,160
And I've been working with him for about this many years. When he first started, he's a really cool dude, by the way.

5
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:34,560
And I'm just letting like he's got a wife, he's got a couple of kids. It's like he's a good old boy from this town.

6
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:40,600
And he was so frustrated because he couldn't grow his business. And so I reached out to him, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

7
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,840
He was sick and tired of like spinning his wheels, paying what's this company called Town Square Media?

8
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,920
He's sick and tired of paying Town Square Media 200 bucks a month for nothing.

9
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,520
So I called him. He wanted leads. He didn't care about what SEO.

10
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,320
He just wanted to get jobs because he wanted to grow his revenue.

11
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:00,760
And so for those reasons, he's been working with me since 2020, right in the middle of coronavirus.

12
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,160
And he's been working with me every single month. And it's been really, really good.

13
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,600
Here's his numbers. Here's how many leads he's gotten. Here's a text.

14
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,320
And this is another little piece I wanted to mention on the screencast and also on the close.

15
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,480
Whenever you have these little snippets and I talk about this in training, whenever you have a text that says, hey, just close that job.

16
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,840
Two thousand dollars. Just had a big month. Sixty thousand dollars this month.

17
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,680
Screenshot that and keep it in a folder with all of your social proof.

18
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,160
OK, screencast, the screencast, the set up.

19
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:34,800
That one's so easy because you've already kind of built that trust and they're listening and they have to watch this video and you could show them on the screen.

20
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,160
So, guys, instead of just saying, here's another website that I have.

21
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,360
No, this is Joe and he lives here.

22
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,560
And this was his objection. And here's how much he's making.

23
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,560
And here's what he said. And, guys, I'm telling you that right there, it might take you 30 more seconds,

24
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,800
but it will save you infinite time when you go to close.

25
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,480
OK, so that's another example. That's a screencast example.
