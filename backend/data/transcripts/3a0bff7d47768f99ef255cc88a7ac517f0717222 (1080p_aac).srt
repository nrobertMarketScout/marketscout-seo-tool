1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,280
The number one thing in a business owner

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,680
is a hungry business owner, right?

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,600
Because they, you're not gonna find,

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,360
you can't, as much as I would love

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,040
to have every business owner be good at sales,

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,240
most of them suck.

7
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,600
Like they're like old plumber,

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,040
let's say it's in the plumbing industry for septic, right?

9
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,200
Cause we do septic.

10
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,480
They're probably an old plumber

11
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,720
that decided to open their own company.

12
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,680
They're not trained in sales, not always.

13
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:29,120
If you find one that are good at plumbing

14
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,720
and business people, those ones are really good.

15
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,400
Typically you don't find that.

16
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:38,400
So you have to remember, it's kind of like,

17
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:42,720
like I guess, so Aaron, Aaron is currently single,

18
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,480
just FYI for any of the ladies out there.

19
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,160
At some point, Aaron's gonna start fricking working

20
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,920
the field, Aaron's gonna start hunting, you know?

21
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,200
He's gonna start fricking prowling around

22
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,800
and he's gonna wanna have a list of things,

23
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,320
even if it's in his head of things that he's looking for.

24
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,080
And as much as he'd like to have every single

25
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,960
one of those things, which he could,

26
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,320
he may be looking for a long time.

27
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,040
And so you kind of have to have this list

28
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,440
within your head of like, what do you want

29
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,320
that business owner, it's your partner.

30
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,960
What are the things ideally you'd want

31
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,400
that business owner to have?

32
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,560
And then in what order are they most important?

33
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,400
And to me, the most important thing is a hunger for leads.

34
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,160
Because if they're hungry for leads,

35
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,240
then they're gonna do their very, very best.

36
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,400
And they may not be perfect on the phone.

37
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,800
They may sound really gravely and scary

38
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,880
and they might have not great customer service,

39
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,960
but at least they're hungry, they're following up,

40
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,160
they want that business.

41
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,840
On the other hand, they can be the best talker

42
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,640
in the world, they can be the best whatever communicator.

43
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,760
But if they're not hungry for the leads,

44
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,840
they're not, like Francesca said,

45
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,040
they're not gonna call them.

46
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,080
They're not gonna address them.

47
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:45,400
They're not gonna, you're gonna really,

48
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,320
really get frustrated.

49
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,000
So to me, the number one thing I look for

50
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,440
is a hungry business owner.

51
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,160
And how do we know that guys?

52
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,560
Aaron, how do we know someone's hungry typically?

53
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,600
When they actually are responsive?

54
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,800
They're responsive, but also going back

55
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,560
to building the list is-

56
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,640
Oh, they're already paying for it, yeah.

57
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,960
They're already paying for it.

58
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,480
Because if they're already paying,

59
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,320
they're either A, hungry for more leads,

60
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,080
or B, they're allergic to money, right?

61
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,800
And the chance of it being B is low, right?

62
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,280
So, great question.
