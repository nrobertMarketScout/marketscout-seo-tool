1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,720
Trust me on this, when people try and rush you through the process, don't let them.

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,220
They want to jump on a Zoom call.

3
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:13,300
I can't remember who dropped the one-liner, it was beautiful.

4
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:20,220
But say something like this, hey, that's cool, I want to talk with you on Zoom as well and

5
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,220
talk about this.

6
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:24,380
But honestly, I only work with one company.

7
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,940
So before we get too ahead of ourselves, I want to see how you actually handle these

8
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:32,180
leads before we, you know, I waste my time or you waste your time.

9
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:33,180
It's a two-way street here.

10
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,300
I'm not, you know, I'm not looking for everybody, okay?

11
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,100
So they want to start pushing you, pull back, pull back.

12
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,220
It's going to make them want you more.

13
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:46,640
You're going to become the pretty girl in the club that everybody wants to touch, everybody

14
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,220
wants to dance with and ain't nobody got business touching and they're not going to, okay?

15
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,100
That's who you're going to become by pulling back.

16
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,900
So follow the process.
