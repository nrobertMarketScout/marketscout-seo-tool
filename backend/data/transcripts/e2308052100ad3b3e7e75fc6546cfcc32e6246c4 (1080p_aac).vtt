Pick a contract length. Decide, are you going to do a contract? In my opinion, you're crazy

00:04.800 --> 00:10.880
not to do a contract. Pick a contract length and say, I'm doing this contract. I'm not giving them

00:10.880 --> 00:15.040
the option of month to month. I'm not giving them the option of what type of contract. We're doing

00:15.040 --> 00:20.800
one contract and we're doing a contract. For me, it was a six-month contract. Now, you go in and

00:20.800 --> 00:24.800
they won't agree to a contract and you have to do a three-month instead of a six-month to get the

00:24.800 --> 00:28.240
deal. Fine. But you have it in your head. You're only going to do one. You're only going to focus

00:28.240 --> 00:30.240
on when you're going to pitch one.
