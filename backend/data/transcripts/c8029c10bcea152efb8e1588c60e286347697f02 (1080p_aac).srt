00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,320
I warren how important is the keyword difficulty value?

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:11,040
I don't pay attention to that what I look at bro is and if you're talking about like on some of these tools like

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,040
Keyword difficulty blah blah blah

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:18,480
I would pay attention to how it is compared to other projects, but I'm looking at the CPC

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,960
And I'm looking at the due diligence sheet as a whole because if I'm going into tree service

6
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,960
I'm trying to rank for tree removal

7
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,080
Tree service tree cutting tree trimming stump removal

8
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:36,640
I'm trying to rank for all those and so just because one of those is really difficult according to the tool

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,080
Doesn't mean that all of them are difficult and I'm looking at it as a whole and so I don't really pay attention

10
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,960
I think it would be valuable to maybe look and see how they compare but keep in mind the tools

11
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,720
The tools are wrong. It's only about comparisons
