00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,040
How often are you calling BO's after closing them to make sure they're happy?

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,120
I've just got an email saying, can we chat about a few things?

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,120
Hopefully he's not going to cancel out there two months.

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:13,040
Oh, don't you guys love when you get those emails, those convert, those text messages?

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,320
Sometimes it's from your clients.

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,240
Sometimes it's from your wife or your spouse or your significant other.

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,800
Or I remember being a kid and my dad would be like, we got to go.

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,200
We got to go check out my, if Porter is on here or Zach,

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,800
we got to go check on the pumps.

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,400
We got to go check all the font.

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,440
Like, dude, I'm driving around with dad, getting a lecture is the worst.

12
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,240
I know the stress.

13
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:40,000
Typically what we like to do is reminder Mike is during that first contract,

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,040
whether it's three months, whether it's six months, whether it's a year,

15
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,160
if you, if you go big boy and you do a big girl, big boy,

16
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:51,360
and you do a year right at the gate, that is the most important period.

17
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,520
Because if you can get them through that first contract into the second contract,

18
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,000
you're going to see your attrition go way down

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,160
and your attention go way up, which is the same thing.

20
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,200
So what we like to do is now it's a little bit different

21
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,120
because I have Francesca that can assist me with this,

22
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:11,200
but we like to check in weekly with these business owners

23
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,880
at least once a week for the first contract.

24
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,720
Now, typically what that looks like is maybe an email twice a month,

25
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,680
maybe a text message once a month, and maybe a phone call once a month.

26
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,480
Sometimes if they're a little bit like, you know, maybe with this one,

27
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,160
maybe it's a phone call three times a month and it's an email once.

28
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,640
And then the next week, it's like two calls and two emails.

29
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,760
And then the same the next, and it's like, okay, now they're happy.

30
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,120
We can kind of scale back, but I would be checking in at least once a week

31
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,400
until you get to contract number two, which is that year,

32
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,480
because then your attrition goes way down.

33
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:42,880
Okay.
