{"text": " The pre-closed screencast guys this is a highly highly effective tool this is something that should not be skipped this is something that really needs to be done properly okay so before we top over to the screen I give you guys the template I want you guys to understand the objective of the pre-closed screencast which is part of the bigger picture of the setup which is part of the bigger picture of closing the deal okay the purpose and the objective of the pre-closed screencast is twofold number one is to overcome objections that you haven't covered yet okay and there are certain objections that we covered that we talked about that just fit really nicely inside of the screencast because it might be weird to bring them up during a phone call okay so number one is to bring up and overcome objections number two is this is an opportunity for you to basically pitch them without being interrupted and without having the pressure of them being on the call like it's really really nice because you can give this amazing pitch without them even interrupting you or without feeling like it's a pitch okay and so that those are the two objectives during this but this is something that I used to not do and I started implementing this about a year ago maybe it's even less not maybe eight months ago and it is what it works like a charm because it really gets them prepped for the call and you guys will probably if you remember back to when you joined this program okay you probably received a video and you should have received a video right before it said watch this video before we talk and during that I overcame a couple of last a couple last objections where I said hey if you need to talk to your mom or your dog or your goldfish or your aunt bring them to the call because we're not doing the whole I want to think about it thing okay and I was overcoming that objection and I and I showed social proof and I did a few things that's the equivalent of my pre-closed screencast that I'm gonna teach you here so let's hop over the screen so here we have the pre-closed screencast template and I want to share with you the structure okay so there's a couple things that you need to include you don't have to do it in this specific order this is the order that I do it in and I just want to explain it this way so the first thing is we want to make sure and by the way I'm gonna give you guys examples of this we're gonna have some some examples attached some examples there's tons of examples already in the group of actual screencasts that I've done so I'm not gonna share one in this video because I don't want to make it long I just want to share the template okay so the first thing is I want to share how we get our leads in the strategy behind it and the thing that I use here is I show them an actual example and I like to use the monopoly strategy slash concept so I explain the monopoly thing I say hey look when you're playing monopoly there's a giant board and the more properties that you can you know buy the better chance you have a win in the game and these properties at the top or the boardwalk the park place etc etc etc that's how I explain it and I explain how we get the leads guys I've been in groups where people ask they're like hey what happens at the business owner they ask what the website is if they ask what happens if they ask I'm getting the lead tell them okay guys you don't need to hide stuff this is a very straight-up process you do not need to hide anything so number one thing is I explain how we get the leads in the strategy behind again there's gonna be an example I show you this entire thing okay the second thing as I've listed here is I show example sites so I like to best case scenario is you show them a niche sorry you show them a site in the niche that you're going after so if you're targeting somebody that's doing concrete you show them an example of concrete you show them a site you show them results you use that as a case study however if you don't have one this is your first time going into that niche what I would do and what I typically like to do is I like to show them a case study an example or a site in that city or close to that city so here in st. George let's say I have a duck cleaning site but I'm going after tree service I might not have any other tree services my first tree service site but I'm gonna show them a duck cleaning site because it just relates they're like oh that guy's in st. George that lady's in st. George that makes sense right we're showing these examples so I put that right here preferably in their niche or in their state and city and then if you guys have a lot of leads coming from those projects let's say you have a site already built it's generating leads you can show that if you don't don't worry it's there's not specific things you need to show you it's just showing them that you've done this before if you have a really good case study and you can show them hey this business owner has gotten this many leads show them that okay I noted here if you don't have any projects you don't have any other sites leverage the group man leverage the group we have so many case studies combined between all of us in this program at the time of recording this it's so many case studies so many websites leverage the group so if you don't have any don't worry about it make a post search for post and say hey guys does anyone have a concrete project I can use as a case study use and leverage the group okay number three is I show social proof okay including screenshots of text messages reviews etc also sometimes show contracts whatever stripe accounts the proof number one I have customers number two that people are really making some some money so what I would recommend is anytime you're communicating with a business owner and they tell you about some amazing story that they closed a huge monster deal we've all been on the phone or you will be on the phone where the business owner says hey you sent me those leads I just closed a $50,000 job what I say in those situations I'm like hey just so I can use that as kind of a testimony I'm gonna message you here in just a second after we help with the phone I'm gonna ask you a question about how things are going if you would just respond don't be fake about it but if you would just respond and tell me you just what you just told me on text I can screenshot that and use that as a case study and I can use that as proof that this works if you wouldn't mind that would help me out immensely and guys I just have a folder of case studies so for example one of the ones I use you're gonna see this in the example is I had this lady in Las Vegas and she sends me a text she's like hey I just closed one of your leads for like 40 grand so I like to show that example I'm like hey here's one of my artificial turf clients in Las Vegas she closed the job for 40,000 bucks okay it's literally proving like hey I showed you the lead value calculator but here is proof that they're actually that these people are actually closing jobs okay so I like to show social proof including screenshots screenshots of text messages reviews etc and then I also like to explain this is where I'm gonna explain the deal structure so I will basically shit on commission I'm like hey just you guys know or just so you know here's how the deal typically works and how we do this first of all we don't and that's how I say first of all we don't do commission okay there's no skin in the game for you and there's no incentive for me to even send you leads because I don't even know if you're gonna close I don't do commission never have never will okay secondly I don't do paper lead and in the beginning just so you guys understand or just so you understand mr. business owner mr. business owner I did this in the beginning and I tell a story I say I used to work with this company and I sent them leads and we agreed a hundred bucks a lead okay here's what happened is I they were cool paying at you know I usually shoot high so I get kind of start price anchoring them I said they were they were cool at a hundred bucks a lead sending them 20 30 leads paying two three bucks two three grand a month but my whole goal the whole time was how do I jack these leads how do I get to 50 60 70 because I wanted to make more money obviously I'm human right and let me tell you what happened once I got and I had that month where the website ranked and the leads got spiked through the air and I sent them 70 leads and invoice for seven grand you know what happened they pulled out the red pencil and all of a sudden it became hey that lead didn't answer hey that lead was it was too far out hey that lead was a small job and it became this this whole nitpicky thing okay and it really strained the relationship so since that time that's been a while that's been two years ago three years ago I have done something that's been way better and it's called a flat fee deal and so mr. business or what that means is it's a flat fee deal you pay a certain amount every month or every week and you get every single lead from this website what does that mean well sometimes during the winter it's gonna be slow I'm gonna tell you that right now okay guess what in the spring when the leads are just crushing it and it's tax return time and people are cleaning up their yards and blah blah blah I'm not gonna come out to you for more money okay so you know exactly how much is coming out every single month and you get the upside of those additional leads okay that's it guys those are the things that I include in my screencast I noted here do not give price do not give price I usually let them know after I explain the deal structure I'm like hey as far as the actual cost per month or per week we're gonna discuss that tomorrow I got to finish writing the numbers but I promise you will be reasonable and then I last thing as I noted here is I like to end with a pullback okay so what I say is hey so I'm look I'm really looking forward to talking tomorrow and by the way like all I want to do is see if this is a good fit if we find out this is a good fit let's make something happen let's make a lot of money together but at the same time if it's not no big deal you know there's a lot of companies to work with and I only work with one okay see tomorrow and I just end with that pullback I'm taking off the pressure I'm letting them know hey no big deal no harm no foul I end with that pullback guys the pullbacks you can use them again and again and again and you can never overuse them so guys after you've done the screencast and just so you know I should have mentioned this earlier the tool that I like to use is a tool it's called the Vimeo recorder in fact hop over the screen let me show you what I'm talking about so guys over here on the Google Chrome store if you guys aren't using Google Chrome you're crazy I've already mentioned this you need to be go to the just type in Google Chrome store and you can get this little plug-in or this little extension I apologize just type in Vimeo and it's this Vimeo record I love this one because you can just push up here you could probably see it right here you could just push this and like if I click it like this it's literally just gonna let me push start recording and I'm automatically there and then as soon as I'm done it's just gonna upload it to my Vimeo account okay so I really really like that tool but there's a ton of tools that you can use so make sure that you record the tool as a screencast that's number one number two when you send this screencast make sure that you can track it so you know there's like if you want to use loom that's cool too loom is gonna tell you when they open the screencast that's a cool tool I like having Vimeo because I use Vimeo for everything loom would be a cool tool because you can see it so what I typically do is I use a software where if I send this as an email I send a link as an email I can tell when they open the email and when they clicked on the link and there's a ton of tools I don't even want to mention any but I used to use one called banana tag which they've since kind of gone out of business I don't even know if my banana tag even works anymore and so I don't even have to ask myself guys what we're using at this time but I definitely recommend finding something and you could just go ahead and Google and type in link let's see like email opening software whatever and there's gonna be tons of options let me get rid of this this is really bugging me okay trash this get rid of this okay yeah so write inbox sales handy mail check whatever just use something so that you know when they open the link and when they watch the video okay lastly make sure they watch the video okay if you guys record these videos and then they don't watch them what why'd you record it right why did you record it make sure they watch the video so before you jump on the call say hey talk to you in 30 minutes just want to make sure you watch the video before we talk okay that is going to be part of the the the objections we're overcoming part of the objections during that video so they have to watch it you guys notice before we got on a call before you join flat view mastery you were sent a video and and I said or whoever onboarded you said hey make sure you watch this video before we talk guys there is no hidden secret here I am doing the exact same process that I'm teaching right here and it's working like a charm and the last thing I want to mention is the length of these videos should be no more than 10 minutes 10 to 12 max but guys if you start rambling on you start talking about stupid stuff that no one cares about you start talking about backlinks and you start including stuff that I didn't cover in the template you're going to lose them they're not gonna watch the video okay get to the point be conversational talk to them like you're talking to them in person and make this something that they can actually stand listening to do not get into backlinks and the ranking and all this crazy stuff and do not make this 15 minutes okay 10 minutes or less the shorter the better the shorter that the shorter it is the more likely they are to watch the video", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 15.56, "text": " The pre-closed screencast guys this is a highly
