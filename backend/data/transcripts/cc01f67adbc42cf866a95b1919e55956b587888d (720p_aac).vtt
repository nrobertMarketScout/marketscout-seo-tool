Tips on closing faster.

00:02.160 --> 00:03.900
I find it takes a few weeks to close

00:03.900 --> 00:06.160
while it takes some like two weeks.

00:06.160 --> 00:08.040
Nate Eath, great question.

00:08.040 --> 00:10.640
My biggest advice for that is

00:12.160 --> 00:16.580
you don't need as many leads as you think, okay?

00:17.720 --> 00:22.720
I have closed deals where I've sent two leads

00:23.040 --> 00:25.560
in a period of 24 hours.

00:25.560 --> 00:27.760
They haven't even run the leads.

00:27.760 --> 00:30.280
They've literally just scheduled the estimates

00:30.280 --> 00:32.440
or yeah, usually scheduled the estimates

00:32.440 --> 00:34.440
but they haven't even gotten the chance to get out.

00:34.440 --> 00:36.200
But I can tell by the way we're talking,

00:36.200 --> 00:37.960
I can tell by the rapport that was built,

00:37.960 --> 00:40.400
I can just tell because I've done it enough,

00:40.400 --> 00:42.360
hey, this person is ready to go.

00:42.360 --> 00:44.280
This person's ready to freaking,

00:44.280 --> 00:45.800
you know what I'm saying?

00:45.800 --> 00:46.840
And I'm sending it.

00:46.840 --> 00:51.040
So my only advice is test it, dude.

00:51.040 --> 00:52.200
Test it at three leads.

00:52.200 --> 00:54.640
If you have three leads sent, two leads sent

00:54.640 --> 00:56.680
and it feels right, even though you're like,

00:56.680 --> 00:58.960
man, that seems like it's only been two days

00:58.960 --> 00:59.960
or I've only sent them two leads

00:59.960 --> 01:02.180
but it just kind of feels like they're ready, send it, dude.

01:02.180 --> 01:03.020
Try it out.

01:03.020 --> 01:04.120
What's the worst that can happen?

01:04.120 --> 01:06.920
You don't need to send as many leads as you think, okay?
