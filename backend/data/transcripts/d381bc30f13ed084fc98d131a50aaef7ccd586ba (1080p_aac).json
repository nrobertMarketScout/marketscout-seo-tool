{"text": " Chris asks, he says, is the one-pager borrow idea still an option or has Google started preventing that by giving you a message of plagiarized content when you go to run ads? So far for me, that's never happened. Now I do know that Daniela had an issue with one of her ads that she put up as a one-pager, but I know she was using a .godaddy or something like that. I don't know if it had to do with it being a .godaddy. I've never had any issues, so I'm still going to roll with that until I have an issue. I'm going to keep rolling with that. So as far as I know, and just so everybody knows, I still use a whatever it is, cityservice.weebly.com with borrowed content, right?
