1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,440
Hey, Gene, maybe I need to be focusing my guys in on these contracts.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,120
That's one area I might have gotten too smart.

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,160
I just went month to month.

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,520
And maybe they're dude, that's a hundred percent, bro.

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,520
It's not even about the like, I'm not saying that's a hundred percent,

6
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,240
but like, if you're not doing a contract, you're crazy.

7
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,760
That's like why it's part of the process.

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,360
It's not that if they sign a six month contract,

9
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,640
you're even going to take them to court.

10
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,920
Like, let's be real, the amount of money it's going to cost you to take them to court

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,760
and how much you're going to get, it's not really worth it.

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,040
The fact of the matter is when they know that there's a contract

13
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,880
and they physically or they intentionally sign it,

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,360
that is them committing.

15
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,080
And I always use this analogy.

16
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,600
Is it easier for someone to end a relationship

17
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,200
that is like a boyfriend, girlfriend relationship or a marriage?

18
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,080
You might have like some real shit going on in your marriage,

19
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,880
but because you've committed, because you've gone through that process,

20
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,080
you've signed that shit.

21
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:01,760
And because it's not as easy to get out of without having a little bit of like shit happen,

22
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,160
people think twice, man.

23
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,920
People think twice, three times, four times, sign that thing.

24
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,560
Even though you know damn well that like at the end of the day,

25
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,960
you're probably not going to get anything from them in court.

26
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,920
It's them signing, it's them committing.

27
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,840
And here's how I pitched the contract, Gene.

28
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,560
I say, look, yeah, of course there's a contract.

29
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,760
I'm committing to you.

30
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,760
I'm a hundred percent exclusive to you.

31
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,680
I can't talk to any other business owners.

32
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:30,720
If we don't do an agreement, then that's like me being committed to you,

33
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,160
but you can quit at any time.

34
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,080
I'm committing to you.

35
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,680
I'm ceasing all conversations with business owners.

36
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,640
I'm going all in on you.

37
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,720
That's like having a marriage where only one person's married,

38
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,160
the other person could do whatever the hell they want.

39
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,200
It doesn't make sense.

40
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,160
Yes, there's a contract.

41
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:44,720
It's six months.

42
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,840
At the end of six months, if you don't like me, I don't like you, we end that shit.

43
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,760
But my guess is that at the end of this thing,

44
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,760
you're just going to ask me if I can keep the price the same

45
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,840
and not increase the price because I'm going to be killing it for you.

46
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,280
That's how I pitch it.

47
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,680
Don't shy away from it.

48
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,560
Contract's not a big deal.

49
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,520
We sign contracts every day.

50
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,400
We get contracts on our phone.

51
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,520
We got contracts in our houses.

52
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,160
Most people have contracts on their cars.

53
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,160
People have contracts on everything.

54
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,360
We got all kinds of stuff.

55
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,480
Isaac, we just went to the gym.

56
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,160
We just signed a three-year contract in the gym.

57
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,680
Contracts are part of life.

58
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,360
Don't let people tell you, I don't do contracts.

59
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,160
Bullshit.

60
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,400
Ask them, did you pay for your phone outright?

61
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,040
I actually did.

62
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,520
Funny thing is I say that I actually bought the shit outright.

63
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,240
But 99% of people, they have contracts.

64
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,280
That's part of life.
