00:00.000 --> 00:04.180
Another common question that we get is about the different types of search campaign

00:04.180 --> 00:08.720
So people ask is a search campaign better than a call-only campaign

00:08.760 --> 00:12.400
So in the training we set up two different ones

00:12.400 --> 00:18.680
We set up the call-only campaign and we also have a video for the website search traffic with the call-out extension

00:18.680 --> 00:24.460
I feel for the majority of the Legion stuff that we're doing that the website

00:24.700 --> 00:30.100
The search traffic with the call-out extension is going to be the most versatile for you

00:30.100 --> 00:37.580
It's going to give you the most utility for the majority of the legions that we're running having said that though the call campaign works

00:37.580 --> 00:39.100
for things that are

00:39.100 --> 00:41.540
emergency urgent 24 hours

00:42.060 --> 00:46.700
They do have a place where if you're running a like a web search campaign

00:47.100 --> 00:52.820
Oversay like a city area and you want to kind of spread out into a rural area that doesn't have a big population

00:53.500 --> 00:55.640
Sometimes there's not a lot of call search

00:56.220 --> 01:02.140
Competition out there and you can run that ad in those rural areas and it's really cheap and easy to do and it can just

01:02.140 --> 01:05.860
Maybe get you a handful more leads per month, but you don't need to run both

01:06.620 --> 01:11.780
You run them separate if you're going to do it, but I would recommend the website search traffic with the call-out extension
