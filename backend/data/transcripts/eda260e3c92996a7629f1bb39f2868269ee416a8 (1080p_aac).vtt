00:00.000 --> 00:03.420
["Take Me By Your Side"]

00:10.840 --> 00:14.440
Guys, it's time to freaking close the deal, baby.

00:14.440 --> 00:16.400
And everything, again, I've said this on the last video,

00:16.400 --> 00:17.280
I've said this multiple times,

00:17.280 --> 00:20.300
everything that we are doing up until this point

00:20.300 --> 00:22.480
is leading us to this moment, okay?

00:22.480 --> 00:24.560
And that's not to psych you out,

00:24.560 --> 00:25.680
that's not to spook you out,

00:25.680 --> 00:27.240
that's not to overthink it or get nervous

00:27.240 --> 00:28.120
or get sweaty palms.

00:28.120 --> 00:29.660
Guys, if you've done this correctly,

00:29.660 --> 00:32.380
I need you to also remember as serious as this moment is,

00:32.380 --> 00:33.620
if you've done this correctly,

00:33.620 --> 00:34.720
this should be a piece of cake.

00:34.720 --> 00:37.460
There should be very little apprehension,

00:37.460 --> 00:40.220
very little in terms of objections and all that kind of stuff.

00:40.220 --> 00:43.660
You're just gonna be relaxed, but be in the moment, okay?

00:44.580 --> 00:46.180
I'm excited, I love this part.

00:46.180 --> 00:47.460
This is literally what I live for.

00:47.460 --> 00:49.820
And I will tell you that back

00:49.820 --> 00:51.060
when I first started doing sales,

00:51.060 --> 00:52.660
this part freaked me out

00:52.660 --> 00:54.620
because I knew that I was going into a bloodbath

00:54.620 --> 00:56.060
and they were gonna object

00:56.060 --> 00:57.420
and I was gonna have to say these things

00:57.420 --> 00:58.760
I didn't wanna say and all this stuff.

00:58.760 --> 00:59.800
Well, guess what?

00:59.800 --> 01:01.640
We do the setup correctly

01:01.640 --> 01:03.880
so that we don't have to go through that, okay?

01:03.880 --> 01:06.320
So one thing I want to mention really quick

01:06.320 --> 01:08.560
before we hop over to the closing script

01:08.560 --> 01:09.920
which we're gonna go through

01:09.920 --> 01:12.680
is I wanna talk really quickly about rapport.

01:12.680 --> 01:16.320
So as soon as the customer jumps onto the Zoom,

01:16.320 --> 01:18.200
it's fine to spend a few minutes just like,

01:18.200 --> 01:19.040
hey, how's it going?

01:19.040 --> 01:20.480
Or maybe they have something on the wall

01:20.480 --> 01:22.040
and you ask them a question.

01:22.040 --> 01:24.720
But guys, I used to think like when I first started,

01:24.720 --> 01:25.560
I heard about rapport

01:25.560 --> 01:27.640
and I thought you needed to talk about fly fishing

01:27.640 --> 01:32.640
or guns or trucks, golf, something like that

01:33.680 --> 01:37.040
for 30 minutes to build rapport, okay?

01:37.040 --> 01:39.240
And I realized that's not what rapport is.

01:39.240 --> 01:42.200
Rapport is showing the customer

01:42.200 --> 01:43.600
that you know what they're,

01:43.600 --> 01:44.680
first of all, you care.

01:44.680 --> 01:46.000
First of all, or second of all,

01:46.000 --> 01:48.040
that you have what they need.

01:48.040 --> 01:49.840
Third of all, you know what the hell you're talking about.

01:49.840 --> 01:53.360
And fourth of all, that you know how to get them a result

01:53.360 --> 01:54.940
and you are there for business, okay?

01:54.940 --> 01:57.200
Above all, it's showing them that you're professional

01:57.200 --> 01:59.840
and you mean business and you don't need to be rude.

01:59.840 --> 02:01.040
You don't need to cut them off,

02:01.040 --> 02:04.200
but you do not need to spend 30 minutes

02:04.200 --> 02:07.840
talking about fly fishing or generators or food storage

02:07.840 --> 02:09.560
or whatever weird thing they're into

02:09.560 --> 02:10.720
that you can make a connection.

02:10.720 --> 02:12.680
I know that people think that sales, it's not.

02:12.680 --> 02:14.720
Sales is getting in saying, hey, look, Mr. Business Owner,

02:14.720 --> 02:16.160
I wanna respect your time.

02:16.160 --> 02:17.520
I wanna respect my own time

02:17.520 --> 02:19.400
and I wanna get into this, let's go, okay?

02:19.400 --> 02:23.080
They're gonna go, oh shit, this guy means business.

02:23.080 --> 02:25.520
This lady, she means business and let's go, okay?

02:25.520 --> 02:27.320
So don't feel like you need to do that.

02:27.320 --> 02:29.680
I do occasionally, you'll notice in some of the videos

02:29.680 --> 02:31.680
that I've shared or that I will share,

02:31.680 --> 02:33.640
I'll see something, an African painting and go,

02:33.640 --> 02:36.060
hey, just so you know, where are you from?

02:36.060 --> 02:37.880
Okay, cool, I actually lived in Africa.

02:37.880 --> 02:40.240
I make a connection, but it's not necessary

02:40.240 --> 02:41.840
and I don't dwell on it, okay?

02:41.840 --> 02:45.480
So let's hop over to the closing script.

02:45.480 --> 02:49.040
Okay, guys, we are at the FFM Closing Script 2.0.

02:49.040 --> 02:53.680
I'm actually really excited to say that this has changed.

02:53.680 --> 02:58.680
So when we filmed module one live back in December of 2021,

03:00.200 --> 03:01.920
we had a different script.

03:01.920 --> 03:04.400
Now, it's very similar, but we have,

03:04.400 --> 03:09.400
or when I say we, I have gone in, I have looked at this,

03:10.280 --> 03:13.740
basically what was happening is I realized it was too long

03:13.740 --> 03:15.360
and I was like, look, we gotta figure out a way

03:15.360 --> 03:18.100
to shorten this up, this is taking way too long.

03:18.100 --> 03:21.000
So I basically said, I'm gonna test this out

03:21.000 --> 03:23.160
and I started doing the script,

03:23.200 --> 03:25.240
but I started pulling chunks of it out, okay?

03:25.240 --> 03:26.480
And I started testing it.

03:26.480 --> 03:29.020
And after about a month of having the exact same result

03:29.020 --> 03:30.840
and closing at a really high rate,

03:30.840 --> 03:32.840
I realized I could remove a bunch of the script.

03:32.840 --> 03:35.680
So if you guys have 1.0, you're gonna see

03:35.680 --> 03:38.200
that there's stuff that's taken out of it

03:38.200 --> 03:40.340
that I think that it was unnecessary, okay?

03:40.340 --> 03:43.320
So this is the latest, the greatest, the leanest,

03:43.320 --> 03:46.160
and I'm trying to continue to shorten this

03:46.160 --> 03:48.040
because I don't think it needs to be super long, okay?

03:48.040 --> 03:51.200
But what I wanna do here is I just wanna go through it.

03:51.200 --> 03:53.140
I'm gonna have, and as you guys have seen,

03:54.120 --> 03:55.860
I have tons of examples of me doing this live.

03:55.860 --> 03:58.420
The best way to give you this example

03:58.420 --> 04:02.660
and showing you how I do this is give you live sales calls.

04:02.660 --> 04:04.020
And so I'm gonna continue to do that.

04:04.020 --> 04:06.020
So I wanna just go through this step by step, okay?

04:06.020 --> 04:10.740
So here at the top, I just have a couple of reminders.

04:10.740 --> 04:13.560
I would recommend printing this and putting it off,

04:13.560 --> 04:16.520
putting it on your desk and studying this thing

04:16.520 --> 04:18.700
over and over and over because if you can learn this

04:18.700 --> 04:20.620
like the back of your hand, you're not gonna have

04:20.620 --> 04:22.420
to refer to it over and over.

04:22.460 --> 04:24.580
And by the way, I will tell you that there are students,

04:24.580 --> 04:29.500
I've watched some of your recordings of your first deals

04:29.500 --> 04:31.060
and I have literally watched,

04:31.060 --> 04:32.840
you look at the business owner over here

04:32.840 --> 04:36.300
and read the script over here and still close the deal.

04:36.300 --> 04:37.820
Like word for word, read the script.

04:37.820 --> 04:41.620
So if you feel at any point you don't know what to say,

04:41.620 --> 04:43.300
just go back to the script, okay?

04:43.300 --> 04:46.860
It is very, very effective and very, very good.

04:46.860 --> 04:48.820
Okay, I'm excited about this guys

04:48.820 --> 04:51.360
and I do wanna say one last thing, not to toot my own horn,

04:51.360 --> 04:53.680
but this is not a script that I Googled,

04:53.680 --> 04:55.840
this is not a script I borrowed and built on.

04:55.840 --> 04:59.320
I built this from scratch and I built this from scratch

04:59.320 --> 05:01.400
based on the experiences that I've had,

05:01.400 --> 05:03.960
based on thousands and thousands,

05:03.960 --> 05:06.400
sitting at thousands and thousands of kitchen tables,

05:06.400 --> 05:08.320
sitting on thousands, well not thousands,

05:08.320 --> 05:11.640
probably hundreds of Zoom calls, soon to be thousands,

05:11.640 --> 05:13.000
maybe we're close to thousands,

05:13.000 --> 05:16.720
but this is a script that I've built,

05:16.720 --> 05:20.120
tweaked, tested, torn apart, put back together.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.960
It has been refined and refined

05:21.960 --> 05:23.140
and will continue to be refined.

05:23.140 --> 05:27.360
It is a living, breathing document and it works.

05:27.360 --> 05:29.200
And I'm proud of that, but I want you to know

05:29.200 --> 05:30.720
this is not a script that I pulled and said,

05:30.720 --> 05:32.000
let me just tweak it.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.640
No, this is from scratch.

05:34.640 --> 05:36.840
I pulled open a document and I said,

05:36.840 --> 05:38.880
all right, let's start building this out.

05:38.880 --> 05:41.640
And it was a blank canvas and this is the masterpiece

05:41.640 --> 05:43.240
and it works, okay?

05:43.240 --> 05:47.040
So also note, this is the same script I used

05:47.040 --> 05:50.020
when I launched this program to get the first 30 of you

05:50.020 --> 05:51.660
to join the program.

05:51.660 --> 05:53.620
It's also the script that every single one of you

05:53.620 --> 05:55.460
that's got on a one-on-one Zoom call with me,

05:55.460 --> 05:58.380
I have used this exact same format

05:58.380 --> 05:59.700
to get you into the program.

05:59.700 --> 06:02.180
So if you wanna talk about being sold on your product,

06:02.180 --> 06:03.260
you wanna talk about a product that works,

06:03.260 --> 06:05.620
you wanna talk about drinking the Kool-Aid,

06:05.620 --> 06:06.660
I'm drinking my Kool-Aid,

06:06.660 --> 06:09.940
because I'm literally using the script

06:09.940 --> 06:13.220
to get you into the program that I'm actually selling you on.

06:13.220 --> 06:15.500
So work that one through your head.

06:15.500 --> 06:17.260
All right, let's go into this.

06:17.260 --> 06:18.900
First thing that I do, I got a little asterisk here,

06:18.980 --> 06:20.860
I wanna keep this video condensed, so let's go into it.

06:20.860 --> 06:22.500
First thing I do, I take the pressure off,

06:22.500 --> 06:25.460
I let them know, hey, I'm not the hard close guy,

06:25.460 --> 06:28.940
I'm just looking to see if this is a fit, okay?

06:28.940 --> 06:31.020
That is literally it and I let them know,

06:31.020 --> 06:32.640
I'm like, hey, I don't have a big spiel for you,

06:32.640 --> 06:34.380
even though secretly I kinda do.

06:34.380 --> 06:35.780
I'm like, hey, I don't have a big spiel.

06:35.780 --> 06:38.020
So just take the pressure off.

06:38.020 --> 06:39.620
The less pressure they feel,

06:39.620 --> 06:42.020
the better chance you have of closing it, okay?

06:42.020 --> 06:44.420
And then I talk first about the purpose of the call.

06:44.420 --> 06:47.220
So some points that you can choose to hit on

06:47.260 --> 06:49.700
and you'll notice in my calls, sometimes I hit on them,

06:49.700 --> 06:52.540
sometimes I don't, but I try my best to do it is,

06:52.540 --> 06:55.300
some of the things I cover is, hey, look,

06:55.300 --> 06:57.740
I'm not looking to do this for the next few months,

06:57.740 --> 06:59.260
I'm not looking for a one month deal,

06:59.260 --> 07:01.100
I'm trying to figure out if I can work with you

07:01.100 --> 07:01.940
for the next 10 years.

07:01.940 --> 07:03.820
I can make you money, you can make me money

07:03.820 --> 07:06.340
and we can have a symbiotic relationship for 10 years.

07:06.340 --> 07:08.660
So I'm looking to make sure this is a good fit, okay?

07:08.660 --> 07:09.540
Just so you know.

07:09.540 --> 07:12.460
And then I'll tell them, hey, my objective is to figure out

07:12.460 --> 07:14.120
where you're at and you guys probably remember

07:14.120 --> 07:15.500
some of this stuff when I was talking to you

07:15.500 --> 07:17.820
because my objective is to find out where you're at today

07:17.820 --> 07:19.300
and where you wanna go, okay?

07:19.300 --> 07:21.620
And if my product, my leads can help you get

07:21.620 --> 07:24.060
to where you wanna go from where you're at fast,

07:24.060 --> 07:26.260
then we got a really interesting conversation

07:26.260 --> 07:27.540
we're probably gonna be able to make something work.

07:27.540 --> 07:30.180
And if it doesn't, Mr. Business Owner, I will tell you,

07:30.180 --> 07:32.340
I will be the first to end this call and I'll end it early

07:32.340 --> 07:34.180
because the time is the one thing that we can't get back,

07:34.180 --> 07:35.020
okay?

07:36.580 --> 07:40.300
Also, I put, here this kind of go in with that last point,

07:40.300 --> 07:43.900
if my exclusive concrete leads help you achieve that goal,

07:43.900 --> 07:44.860
that's the same thing, okay?

07:44.860 --> 07:46.160
It's just kind of tied in.

07:48.020 --> 07:48.860
Boom.

07:48.860 --> 07:50.460
And then I also will sometimes hit on this a lot

07:50.460 --> 07:53.620
and I'll say, hey, look, and I told some of you guys this,

07:53.620 --> 07:55.500
if this isn't a good fit, I'm not gonna push it

07:55.500 --> 07:58.020
because I'm not interested in trying to sell you

07:58.020 --> 07:59.820
every single month on why you should stay with me,

07:59.820 --> 08:00.940
why you should be with me.

08:00.940 --> 08:02.540
I want somebody that's in this for the long run

08:02.540 --> 08:05.100
and I wanna make a lot of money together, okay?

08:05.100 --> 08:07.180
And then this is very, very important.

08:07.180 --> 08:09.780
My only ask, this is why I put it in italics, okay?

08:09.780 --> 08:11.260
And you can say some version of this.

08:11.260 --> 08:14.300
Don't put pressure, but say something to this extent

08:14.300 --> 08:16.020
is I say, hey, like I told you,

08:16.020 --> 08:18.260
my only ask is this, man, or lady.

08:18.260 --> 08:19.620
I've got a call in a couple hours.

08:19.620 --> 08:22.260
All I ask is that at the end of this, if this is a fit,

08:22.260 --> 08:24.620
let's rock and roll, let's shake and bake, let's do this.

08:24.620 --> 08:26.940
I truly believe money loves speed.

08:26.940 --> 08:28.460
I might even be wearing a sweater.

08:28.460 --> 08:30.820
So all I ask, if this makes sense, let's do it.

08:30.820 --> 08:33.940
Let's not hobnob around and you leave me in I don't know zone.

08:33.940 --> 08:35.740
That's the only thing I ask, okay?

08:35.740 --> 08:38.580
And also, if it's not a fit, just tell me straight up,

08:38.580 --> 08:40.900
I'm a big boy, I'm a big girl,

08:40.900 --> 08:42.260
you're not gonna make me lose sleep.

08:42.260 --> 08:43.380
That's my only ask.

08:43.380 --> 08:44.700
We on the same page, okay?

08:44.700 --> 08:47.500
That's basically me saying, hey, look, bro, look, lady.

08:47.500 --> 08:49.620
All I ask is that you give me a yes, no at the end of this,

08:49.620 --> 08:50.900
but I'm saying it in a little bit different way

08:50.900 --> 08:53.340
so I'm not adding the pressure, okay?

08:53.340 --> 08:57.780
So first thing after you kind of set the stage

08:57.780 --> 08:59.260
is I wanna learn about their company.

08:59.260 --> 09:01.580
Guys, get interested in this part, enjoy this part.

09:01.580 --> 09:03.260
Get a piece of paper, get a pen.

09:03.260 --> 09:05.860
I have a yellow notepad sitting there in my remarkable.

09:05.860 --> 09:07.220
And I literally, I tell them, I say,

09:07.220 --> 09:08.540
I wanna learn just a little bit.

09:08.540 --> 09:09.740
I wanna ask you a couple questions

09:09.740 --> 09:11.060
to figure out where you're currently at.

09:11.060 --> 09:12.160
And these are the questions I'll ask.

09:12.160 --> 09:13.920
I'll be like, hey, and I'll tell them,

09:13.920 --> 09:15.800
hey, I don't wanna be weird, I don't wanna be intrusive.

09:15.800 --> 09:17.320
I wanna know these things

09:17.320 --> 09:18.760
because I wanna find out where you're at

09:18.760 --> 09:19.720
and then where you wanna go.

09:19.720 --> 09:23.360
So just so you know, I'm not trying to peek

09:23.360 --> 09:25.680
into your life too much, but it does matter to me

09:25.680 --> 09:27.840
because I wanna see if I can help you, okay?

09:27.840 --> 09:29.880
So some of the stuff I will ask them, what's your, hey,

09:29.880 --> 09:32.760
so tell me, how much revenue did you do last year, right?

09:32.760 --> 09:34.200
How much, how much, okay?

09:35.560 --> 09:38.940
And I'll say, so okay, cool, you did a mill last year.

09:38.940 --> 09:40.840
What do you wanna do this year, okay?

09:42.280 --> 09:44.000
And then I'll ask them like, how does,

09:44.000 --> 09:45.600
so like, how does your business make money?

09:45.600 --> 09:46.960
Like tell me, I know you're in concrete.

09:46.960 --> 09:50.260
Do you do more of the commercial jobs?

09:50.260 --> 09:52.360
Do you do more of the residential?

09:52.360 --> 09:54.320
How are you currently getting your business?

09:54.320 --> 09:56.520
Like all of those things, I just wanna find

09:56.520 --> 09:58.600
as much information as I can

09:58.600 --> 10:00.360
so that I can figure out if I can actually help them.

10:00.360 --> 10:02.000
Because if they start telling me, hey,

10:02.000 --> 10:04.200
all we're looking to do is get commercial jobs.

10:04.200 --> 10:06.000
First of all, I should already know this by now

10:06.000 --> 10:07.040
and that's probably not a good fit

10:07.040 --> 10:08.240
because most of these leads aren't commercial.

10:08.240 --> 10:09.840
But if they sit there and go, hey,

10:09.840 --> 10:11.560
we're plenty good on residential.

10:11.560 --> 10:12.720
We only want commercial.

10:12.720 --> 10:15.600
I'm gonna tell them, hey, just to be honest with you,

10:15.600 --> 10:17.560
Mr. Business Owner, Mrs. Business Owner,

10:17.560 --> 10:20.260
most of these jobs, 75% of them are gonna be residential.

10:20.260 --> 10:22.760
So if that's gonna be an issue, I'm not gonna lie to you

10:22.760 --> 10:24.000
and tell you they're all gonna be commercial.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.520
There are gonna be some, but I don't wanna waste your time.

10:26.520 --> 10:27.880
A lot of this is gonna be residential.

10:27.880 --> 10:29.420
However, I will tell you this.

10:29.420 --> 10:32.960
When you have an overflow of residential concrete leads,

10:32.960 --> 10:34.840
you can do something called cherry picking,

10:34.840 --> 10:39.140
which is charging premium and pick the best jobs.

10:39.140 --> 10:39.980
Excuse me.

10:40.900 --> 10:45.560
Having too many leads is not actually a bad thing, okay?

10:45.560 --> 10:47.660
I also ask them, what's the end goal?

10:47.660 --> 10:49.820
And again, guys, my biggest thing with this

10:49.820 --> 10:51.140
is because you can add questions,

10:51.140 --> 10:53.020
you can take questions away,

10:53.020 --> 10:54.900
find out what makes them tick

10:54.900 --> 10:55.740
and what's important to them.

10:55.740 --> 10:56.920
And they're gonna give you,

10:56.920 --> 10:58.400
this is a really important question

10:58.400 --> 11:00.180
because they're gonna give you some bullshit answer

11:00.180 --> 11:02.860
and say, well, I wanna make $2 million a month, right?

11:02.860 --> 11:05.740
I wanna get the five million, okay, cool.

11:05.740 --> 11:06.580
Why?

11:06.580 --> 11:08.940
And Mr. Business Owner, I don't want you to feel

11:08.940 --> 11:10.660
like I'm being that just weird,

11:10.660 --> 11:12.420
but why do you wanna get there?

11:12.420 --> 11:13.300
What is it actually?

11:13.300 --> 11:14.620
You wanna get the five million, why?

11:14.620 --> 11:17.500
Because do you wanna be, is it a recognition thing?

11:17.500 --> 11:19.140
Do you wanna prove somebody wrong?

11:19.140 --> 11:20.420
Do you have a vendetta for somebody?

11:20.420 --> 11:21.840
Is it your old boss?

11:21.840 --> 11:23.160
Or do you wanna go golf?

11:23.160 --> 11:25.820
Do you wanna go and spend more time with your family?

11:25.820 --> 11:28.060
Do you wanna be able to start other businesses?

11:28.060 --> 11:29.540
They love talking about this stuff

11:29.540 --> 11:32.300
and it's really interesting if you actually care

11:32.300 --> 11:33.140
to find out.

11:33.140 --> 11:34.860
And you guys know, I ask you the same thing.

11:34.860 --> 11:35.980
I'm like, hey, what do you wanna do?

11:35.980 --> 11:38.160
Okay, I wanna get to 10K, I wanna get to 50K.

11:38.160 --> 11:40.680
Cool, cool story, bro.

11:40.680 --> 11:42.280
Why do you really wanna get to 50K?

11:42.280 --> 11:43.120
What do you wanna do?

11:43.120 --> 11:45.320
Is it just one big F you to the world

11:45.320 --> 11:46.680
that you just wanna prove everyone wrong

11:46.680 --> 11:47.600
and get a chip on your shoulder?

11:47.600 --> 11:49.760
If so, awesome, tell me about it.

11:49.760 --> 11:52.960
I'm right there with you, man, and that's the truth.

11:52.960 --> 11:53.960
Do you wanna go play golf?

11:53.960 --> 11:57.560
Do you wanna be Tim Ferriss and go sip my ties on the beach

11:57.560 --> 11:59.380
and have people rub lotion on your belly?

11:59.380 --> 12:01.320
I'm cool with that, just tell me about it.

12:01.320 --> 12:03.360
Like, I wanna be able to help you get there, okay?

12:03.360 --> 12:05.400
And ask them and really, really care.

12:05.400 --> 12:09.320
And it's important that you dig into their why, okay?

12:09.320 --> 12:12.140
Now, you don't need to go so deep

12:12.140 --> 12:14.240
that it feels like you're doing a therapy session,

12:14.240 --> 12:17.600
but I want, get them to start talking real with you, okay?

12:17.600 --> 12:19.240
Get them to start sharing something

12:19.240 --> 12:20.680
other than I wanna get to 5 million.

12:20.680 --> 12:23.840
That's like, oh, that's such a surface level goal.

12:23.840 --> 12:24.680
Guess what?

12:24.680 --> 12:26.000
I wanna get to a million a month.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.780
I wanna get to 10 million a month, okay?

12:27.780 --> 12:29.000
But it's so much deeper than that,

12:29.000 --> 12:31.640
and I've told you guys, I wanna get those moments

12:31.640 --> 12:34.880
where I set these goals that I never thought I could hit

12:34.880 --> 12:35.720
and I hit them.

12:35.720 --> 12:38.800
I want a Rolodex of exhausted but satisfied moments.

12:38.800 --> 12:40.000
I know what my thing is.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.360
I know what my why is, so it'd be really easy to answer.

12:42.360 --> 12:44.700
A lot of these guys don't know, or a lot of these girls,

12:44.700 --> 12:46.480
you gotta dig in, okay?

12:46.480 --> 12:50.220
So, once we've gathered all that, say awesome.

12:50.220 --> 12:51.840
And then what we're gonna do

12:51.840 --> 12:53.180
is we're gonna start sharing the screen,

12:53.180 --> 12:56.600
but I put right here, preface the pitch, okay?

12:56.600 --> 12:59.320
So I share the screen and I don't share it until now

12:59.320 --> 13:02.940
because maybe you have the script pulled up or whatever.

13:02.940 --> 13:03.780
Make sure everything's clean and go,

13:03.780 --> 13:04.700
okay, hold on one second.

13:04.700 --> 13:05.780
Let me go ahead and share my screen.

13:05.780 --> 13:06.700
Make sure you can see this.

13:06.700 --> 13:08.740
This is why I wanna be on a desktop.

13:08.740 --> 13:10.740
And you're gonna preface the pitch, okay?

13:10.740 --> 13:12.460
So, first thing you're gonna do is you're gonna go,

13:12.460 --> 13:16.100
just so you're aware, our objective is we go into markets

13:16.100 --> 13:17.280
that are low-hanging fruit.

13:17.280 --> 13:19.060
Essentially, the reason I got ahold of you

13:19.060 --> 13:21.460
and the reason we're targeting Queen Creek

13:21.460 --> 13:23.820
is because there's a lot of people looking for concrete

13:23.820 --> 13:25.220
and there's not a lot of competitors

13:25.220 --> 13:27.380
because everybody wants to go after Phoenix.

13:27.380 --> 13:29.040
So we have this really cool opportunity.

13:29.040 --> 13:30.860
That's why I'm calling you, just so you know.

13:30.860 --> 13:31.860
I don't call everybody.

13:31.860 --> 13:33.340
I'm not calling somebody in Mesa

13:33.340 --> 13:35.460
and somebody in Glendale and somebody here and there.

13:35.460 --> 13:36.760
I'm looking at Queen Creek

13:36.760 --> 13:38.600
and I'm gonna work with one person exclusively

13:38.600 --> 13:40.380
because there is an opportunity

13:40.380 --> 13:42.740
that either you're gonna take or somebody else is gonna take

13:42.740 --> 13:44.420
and I'm excited about it, okay?

13:44.420 --> 13:46.600
So you're gonna preface it and you're gonna tell them,

13:46.600 --> 13:50.340
just to be candid with you, as I told you before,

13:50.340 --> 13:52.140
I've been reaching out to the best companies

13:52.140 --> 13:53.340
that look like the best fit

13:53.340 --> 13:55.700
and we wanna work exclusively with one company.

13:55.700 --> 13:57.600
Again, you're planting these seeds, right?

13:57.600 --> 14:01.060
You wanna let them know you work exclusively, okay?

14:01.060 --> 14:04.260
All right, one thing I did note here as a reminder

14:04.260 --> 14:05.540
is the sell through the client.

14:05.540 --> 14:09.180
So, and I'm gonna talk about that in greater detail.

14:09.180 --> 14:11.340
We have live streams that we've done on this concept

14:11.340 --> 14:14.660
but anyway, you're gonna wanna sell through the clients

14:14.660 --> 14:17.300
and instead of it being like, oh, if they ask a question,

14:17.300 --> 14:18.780
instead of you handling it saying, oh yeah,

14:18.780 --> 14:21.340
here's the answer, you're gonna go, hey, great question.

14:21.340 --> 14:24.660
That's exactly what my client Joe in St. George

14:24.660 --> 14:27.580
had the exact same question and here's what he discovered.

14:27.580 --> 14:28.420
Remember that?

14:28.420 --> 14:31.220
He also felt found and also selling through the clients.

14:31.220 --> 14:33.060
Sorry about that, guys.

14:33.060 --> 14:35.460
Anyway, so let's keep going, okay?

14:35.460 --> 14:37.140
So the first thing, once I share the screen,

14:37.140 --> 14:38.660
I'm like, all right, so let me show you something

14:38.660 --> 14:41.820
and I come over here and I reemphasize

14:41.820 --> 14:43.060
the market monopoly strategy.

14:43.060 --> 14:46.580
Keep in mind, we have already shared this to some extent

14:46.580 --> 14:49.140
in our pre-closed screencast.

14:49.140 --> 14:52.140
So this is just reminding them, keeping it top of mind, okay?

14:53.140 --> 14:57.460
One thing I totally left out and I, by the way,

14:57.500 --> 14:59.420
I want this, like this is just how it is.

14:59.420 --> 15:00.380
I kind of spaced it.

15:00.380 --> 15:02.620
I want to make sure you guys remember.

15:02.620 --> 15:05.180
Don't forget at the very first of the call

15:05.180 --> 15:08.700
to make sure they watch the screencast, okay, that you sent

15:08.700 --> 15:09.820
because if they haven't watched it,

15:09.820 --> 15:11.500
and you should know because you should have tracked it,

15:11.500 --> 15:13.580
but double check and make sure they watched it

15:13.580 --> 15:16.220
because if not, that was a waste of time, okay?

15:16.220 --> 15:17.980
And you're gonna have to overcome a lot of objections

15:17.980 --> 15:21.260
that should have been covered in that, okay?

15:21.260 --> 15:25.380
So first thing I do is I show them something like this.

15:25.380 --> 15:27.220
I explain the monopoly strategy, okay?

15:27.860 --> 15:28.700
And I don't need to go into too much detail.

15:28.700 --> 15:30.460
You guys know what that is.

15:30.460 --> 15:32.940
Basically more digital properties equals more money

15:32.940 --> 15:34.780
is that's winning the game, okay?

15:34.780 --> 15:36.300
And I'll show an example site.

15:36.300 --> 15:38.740
So here I'm like, look, I work with a company

15:38.740 --> 15:40.420
called Montgomery Construction.

15:40.420 --> 15:43.140
As you can see, they're actually not even ranked,

15:43.140 --> 15:46.300
but luckily I've been able to rank my homepage.

15:46.300 --> 15:48.260
I've been able to rank the Google My Business

15:48.260 --> 15:49.580
and I actually just noticed this.

15:49.580 --> 15:51.300
I also have my Facebook page.

15:51.300 --> 15:53.660
So I've been able to capture three

15:53.700 --> 15:57.780
of the top 10 organic spots plus one map listing,

15:57.780 --> 15:58.860
three in total.

15:58.860 --> 16:02.660
So I'm almost banging down 33% of all the real estate

16:02.660 --> 16:03.620
on page one.

16:03.620 --> 16:05.180
That is why I'm winning, okay?

16:05.180 --> 16:07.220
So I covered the market monopoly strategy.

16:07.220 --> 16:08.460
I show an example.

16:08.460 --> 16:12.500
And then you can also show, just really briefly go,

16:12.500 --> 16:15.020
hey, and just to give you an idea of what this looks like

16:15.020 --> 16:18.980
once we get to page one, this is the leads from June, okay?

16:18.980 --> 16:21.020
And I'm not even gonna sit here and sometimes I will.

16:21.020 --> 16:25.140
I'll go one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,

16:25.140 --> 16:29.620
nine, 10, and I'll go 11, 12, 13, 14.

16:29.620 --> 16:30.540
You get the point, right?

16:30.540 --> 16:33.780
There's a lot of leads coming in and it is only,

16:33.780 --> 16:35.660
it's not even through the end of the month, okay?

16:35.660 --> 16:37.780
So I'll show them those three things.

16:37.780 --> 16:38.860
I'll show them the example,

16:38.860 --> 16:41.380
I'll show them the Bentonville concrete example,

16:41.380 --> 16:43.060
and then I'll show them the leads if you have them.

16:43.060 --> 16:44.820
Guys, you don't have to show the leads

16:44.820 --> 16:45.660
if you don't have them, okay?

16:45.660 --> 16:47.620
Don't worry about that, okay?

16:47.620 --> 16:49.260
So market monopoly strategy,

16:49.260 --> 16:53.780
and then I mean, I go really deep into that.

16:53.780 --> 16:55.340
Like that is basically it.

16:55.340 --> 16:56.500
So I'm gonna show them that,

16:56.500 --> 16:58.020
I'm gonna show them the site,

16:58.020 --> 17:00.260
and then I'm gonna show them the leads, okay?

17:00.260 --> 17:02.340
And then what I ask them is a really important question.

17:02.340 --> 17:05.740
I say, hey, do you have any questions

17:05.740 --> 17:07.500
about like how this works, anything like that

17:07.500 --> 17:09.260
before we go into price, okay?

17:10.220 --> 17:11.540
Or cost, whatever.

17:11.540 --> 17:14.900
And they might, and this is where they might ask a question

17:14.900 --> 17:16.340
and it might give you some insight

17:16.340 --> 17:18.460
into what they're thinking, okay?

17:18.460 --> 17:20.460
And then what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna explain

17:20.460 --> 17:21.860
and I'm gonna go, hey, like the video

17:21.860 --> 17:22.860
that I sent you yesterday,

17:22.860 --> 17:24.700
so just real quick to understand

17:24.700 --> 17:26.500
why we structure this how we do.

17:26.500 --> 17:28.660
We don't do commission or paper lead.

17:28.660 --> 17:29.780
And I'm sure you can understand,

17:29.780 --> 17:31.420
commission does not make sense, period.

17:31.420 --> 17:32.420
Like we just don't do it.

17:32.420 --> 17:34.660
And just cut it off, say it bluntly,

17:34.660 --> 17:36.220
we do not do commission, never have.

17:36.220 --> 17:37.980
Doesn't make sense, you have no skin in the game,

17:37.980 --> 17:39.380
I have no incentive to get you leads.

17:39.380 --> 17:40.820
It's a dumb model.

17:40.820 --> 17:43.340
Now let me tell you, we used to do paper lead.

17:43.340 --> 17:45.340
And let me tell you what happened, okay?

17:45.340 --> 17:47.640
And I will share the example of the client that I had.

17:47.640 --> 17:49.960
We started on paper lead, it was X amount per month.

17:49.960 --> 17:51.660
I thought it was gonna be the sky's the limit.

17:51.660 --> 17:53.000
Ended up that it wasn't.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.620
They ended up canceling or they ended up bickering

17:55.620 --> 17:58.940
and trying to beat me down on price

17:58.940 --> 18:00.700
and this lead and that lead.

18:00.700 --> 18:02.040
It just didn't work out.

18:02.040 --> 18:05.220
So here's why we do what's called flat fee, okay?

18:05.220 --> 18:08.100
And we put it on a pedestal and we explain it, okay?

18:08.100 --> 18:09.500
And flat fee is the best.

18:09.500 --> 18:11.220
And guys, you need to get sold on the fact

18:11.220 --> 18:14.340
this is the best case scenario for you, of course,

18:14.340 --> 18:16.420
because of the cards on file, but for them as well.

18:16.420 --> 18:18.620
Because when your site does rank

18:18.620 --> 18:20.620
and they go from 12 to 15 leads to 30,

18:20.620 --> 18:23.980
are they really gonna be wanting to pay triple

18:23.980 --> 18:24.980
what they started at?

18:24.980 --> 18:26.280
Hell no, okay?

18:26.280 --> 18:27.740
So it's good for everybody.

18:27.740 --> 18:29.660
Okay, then what we're gonna do is we're gonna open up

18:29.660 --> 18:31.260
the lead value calculator, okay?

18:31.260 --> 18:33.220
And if you don't know or if you wanna wait,

18:33.220 --> 18:34.060
you've done this a few times,

18:34.060 --> 18:36.740
you can go ahead and put their numbers in here.

18:36.740 --> 18:37.780
But I've already done that.

18:37.780 --> 18:38.740
So we're gonna open this up

18:38.740 --> 18:40.620
and we're gonna walk them through it, okay?

18:40.620 --> 18:45.260
And explain that the price that we're gonna charge

18:45.260 --> 18:46.380
or we're about to drop,

18:46.380 --> 18:49.300
it is not based on how I'm feeling right now.

18:49.300 --> 18:51.700
It's not based on what I think you can afford.

18:51.700 --> 18:54.460
It's based on a mathematical equation, okay?

18:54.460 --> 18:56.100
And so here's what we're gonna say.

18:56.100 --> 18:58.580
So I put, explain the goal.

19:00.420 --> 19:02.580
Sorry, explain that the goal is to come up with a price

19:02.580 --> 19:04.540
that even with the worst case scenario,

19:04.540 --> 19:05.820
Mr. Business Owner,

19:05.820 --> 19:08.720
even if that worst case scenario happens,

19:08.720 --> 19:10.680
you're still gonna make money, okay?

19:10.680 --> 19:11.840
And explain that to them.

19:11.840 --> 19:16.840
So to explain, hey, what if we do a deal

19:17.120 --> 19:20.440
and there's, whatever, something crazy happens

19:20.440 --> 19:22.880
and the leads are a little bit slow

19:22.880 --> 19:25.840
and we only get you 10 to 12 leads per month.

19:25.840 --> 19:27.640
That's what I'm basing the price off of.

19:27.640 --> 19:29.720
I'm not basing it off of what if I do

19:29.720 --> 19:31.000
what I did in Bentonville Concrete,

19:31.000 --> 19:32.560
which is probably pretty likely, okay?

19:32.560 --> 19:35.440
So explain that this price is based on worst case scenario

19:35.440 --> 19:38.920
and then you're going to put the number in.

19:38.920 --> 19:41.440
Say, hey, look, what I did is I calculated

19:41.440 --> 19:46.440
and I said, what happens if I only get you 12 leads, right?

19:46.480 --> 19:48.400
Well, based on these numbers right here,

19:48.400 --> 19:49.960
even if I get you 12 leads,

19:49.960 --> 19:51.600
Mr. Business Owner, Mrs. Business Owner,

19:51.600 --> 19:56.600
you're gonna make $18,000 in gross profit per month, okay?

19:58.480 --> 20:02.520
With 12 and I just showed you what's possible, okay?

20:02.520 --> 20:03.960
And again, I don't even wanna do that

20:03.960 --> 20:04.800
because some of you guys are gonna go,

20:04.800 --> 20:05.760
oh, I don't have leads.

20:05.760 --> 20:08.600
I'm showing them the leads and what's possible

20:08.600 --> 20:10.600
because I have it, but if you don't have it,

20:10.600 --> 20:12.320
you don't need to show them that, okay?

20:12.320 --> 20:13.880
You don't need to worry about that.

20:13.880 --> 20:16.960
And so, and say, Mr. Business Owner, Mrs. Business Owner,

20:16.960 --> 20:21.640
at that price, or sorry, at 12 leads, only 12 leads,

20:21.640 --> 20:25.960
you're still looking at $3,600 in net profit, okay?

20:25.960 --> 20:27.760
And then what you're gonna do is you're gonna drop price.

20:27.760 --> 20:28.760
You're gonna come over here

20:28.760 --> 20:31.360
and you're gonna go, based on the numbers,

20:31.400 --> 20:34.560
the price is $2,000 per month,

20:34.560 --> 20:38.000
which we either do monthly or we do weekly,

20:38.000 --> 20:41.320
and then, or you can insert price,

20:41.320 --> 20:44.800
and here's the cool part, you get 100% of the leads.

20:44.800 --> 20:47.320
You get 100% and they're all exclusive, okay?

20:47.320 --> 20:49.600
You get 100% of the leads, they're all exclusive,

20:49.600 --> 20:52.120
and then I put, just so you know,

20:52.120 --> 20:54.040
it is gonna be a little bit slower in December

20:54.040 --> 20:55.200
because of Christmas, okay?

20:55.200 --> 20:57.000
This is me overcoming a future objection.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.640
It is gonna be a little bit slower

20:58.640 --> 21:00.600
because of Christmas in December, but guess what?

21:00.600 --> 21:03.880
In the spring and in the fall, sometimes in the winter,

21:03.880 --> 21:05.840
you're gonna see a huge uptick in leads,

21:05.840 --> 21:07.440
and I'm not gonna come banging on your door

21:07.440 --> 21:08.520
asking you for more money.

21:08.520 --> 21:10.920
All I ask is don't call me on Christmas and bug me

21:10.920 --> 21:12.560
because it is gonna slow down a little bit,

21:12.560 --> 21:16.040
but that's the beauty of the flat fee, okay?

21:16.040 --> 21:18.400
Okay, last thing is explain

21:18.400 --> 21:19.640
that you have a six-month agreement.

21:19.640 --> 21:21.200
So I say, so it's really simple.

21:21.200 --> 21:23.080
Like I said, it's only 2,000 bucks per month,

21:23.080 --> 21:25.760
or you can do it weekly at 400 bucks a week,

21:25.760 --> 21:28.760
sorry, 500 bucks a week, and what we typically do

21:28.760 --> 21:31.880
is I don't like to start with some two,

21:31.880 --> 21:33.480
even a year contract.

21:33.480 --> 21:36.000
I like to start with something that's at least long enough

21:36.000 --> 21:37.680
to give this thing a fair shake,

21:37.680 --> 21:39.920
but it's not so long that either of us feel tied in

21:39.920 --> 21:41.320
because who knows, maybe in a few months

21:41.320 --> 21:42.840
I find someone I wanna work with better.

21:42.840 --> 21:44.480
Maybe you don't like the way I work

21:44.480 --> 21:45.640
and I don't wanna be tied in forever.

21:45.640 --> 21:48.120
However, I do need you to commit

21:48.120 --> 21:49.640
to at least some period of time

21:49.640 --> 21:51.640
because look, I'm committing to you

21:51.640 --> 21:55.000
to be 100% exclusive, so it makes no sense

21:55.000 --> 21:56.940
for you to be able to walk away at any time

21:56.980 --> 21:58.900
because I'm not going and building other relationships.

21:58.900 --> 22:00.300
I'm not talking to other business owners.

22:00.300 --> 22:03.340
I'm married to you, and I need you to be married to me

22:03.340 --> 22:04.300
at least while we're working together.

22:04.300 --> 22:05.780
So what we do is a six-month deal.

22:05.780 --> 22:06.820
At the end of the six months,

22:06.820 --> 22:09.620
my intention is that we roll this into another year,

22:09.620 --> 22:10.860
but at the end of the six months,

22:10.860 --> 22:12.780
if you don't like it, it's no problem, okay?

22:12.780 --> 22:14.420
That's how I explain the contract.

22:14.420 --> 22:18.340
And guys, do not hesitate to bring up contract.

22:18.340 --> 22:19.860
Do not be scared to bring up contract.

22:19.860 --> 22:21.340
Do not bring it up timidly.

22:21.340 --> 22:23.780
If you bring it up timidly, they're going to see that,

22:23.780 --> 22:26.060
they're gonna sense it, and they're gonna exploit it, okay?

22:26.060 --> 22:28.580
They're gonna say, yeah, hell yeah, I have a contract.

22:28.580 --> 22:30.620
Like, what do you think this is, okay?

22:30.620 --> 22:31.460
Like, that's the mentality.

22:31.460 --> 22:32.700
Yeah, of course I have a contract.

22:32.700 --> 22:33.860
I'm gonna be exclusive with you.

22:33.860 --> 22:35.580
What do you expect, right?

22:35.580 --> 22:38.460
That I'm exclusive with you, but you have no,

22:38.460 --> 22:39.780
like, you can walk away at any time.

22:39.780 --> 22:41.820
That makes no sense, okay?

22:41.820 --> 22:43.460
No sense at all, okay?

22:43.460 --> 22:46.580
Anyway, just explain that you have a contract,

22:46.580 --> 22:47.860
and then here's what I do,

22:47.860 --> 22:52.220
is I explain everything one more time that comes with it.

22:52.220 --> 22:55.300
So we drop the price, okay?

22:55.900 --> 22:56.980
So if you guys notice,

22:56.980 --> 22:58.340
this is what we call a shit sandwich.

22:58.340 --> 23:01.860
At the beginning, we're talking about the case studies

23:01.860 --> 23:04.140
and how good it is, that's the bun, right?

23:04.140 --> 23:06.140
So we got the bun, that's the good,

23:06.140 --> 23:07.340
this is the case studies,

23:07.340 --> 23:09.580
this is all the leads that we've gotten,

23:09.580 --> 23:11.060
here's the results, blah, blah, blah,

23:11.060 --> 23:13.780
and then the shit, which is the price,

23:13.780 --> 23:16.660
because as much as I don't wanna say it's the shit,

23:16.660 --> 23:17.860
it's what they're gonna have to pay, right?

23:17.860 --> 23:19.220
So that's the patty.

23:19.220 --> 23:20.540
So you got the bun, which is good,

23:20.540 --> 23:21.780
you got the shit, which is the price,

23:21.780 --> 23:23.180
and then you wanna add a bun,

23:23.180 --> 23:24.900
that's the shit sandwich, to complete it,

23:24.900 --> 23:27.280
you wanna add the bun before you ask for price.

23:27.280 --> 23:28.220
So what you're gonna do,

23:28.220 --> 23:31.380
is you're gonna lay out everything that they get,

23:31.380 --> 23:33.100
before you go for the close,

23:33.100 --> 23:35.620
which I'm gonna save for the next video,

23:35.620 --> 23:36.820
and I will see you there.

23:36.820 --> 23:39.820
["Safe By My Heart"]
