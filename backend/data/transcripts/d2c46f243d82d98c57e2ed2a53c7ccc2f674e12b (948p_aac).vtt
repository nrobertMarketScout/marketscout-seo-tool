WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.080
All right, guys, welcome to the call.

00:04.080 --> 00:06.080
I've got my notes over here.

00:06.080 --> 00:07.080
There's a couple things.

00:07.080 --> 00:09.880
Let me move this onto my screen here.

00:09.880 --> 00:13.360
There's a few things I want to just make sure to cover really, really quick.

00:13.360 --> 00:14.360
Let's see.

00:14.360 --> 00:15.360
Okay.

00:15.360 --> 00:16.360
Two things I want to cover quick.

00:16.360 --> 00:19.480
Then I'm going to have Mr. Zach Palcomano talk about hiring.

00:19.480 --> 00:24.480
We're going to be talking about how leverage, how to scale through hiring, okay?

00:24.480 --> 00:29.960
How to duplicate yourself and actually build a business that you don't have to be a slave

00:30.040 --> 00:31.040
to, okay?

00:31.040 --> 00:37.760
So, number one, I was looking yesterday through the ... I was going through the training

00:37.760 --> 00:38.760
yesterday myself.

00:38.760 --> 00:44.720
Some of you guys know, or most of you guys should know, I am in the process of redoing

00:44.720 --> 00:51.380
the training and not just reshooting the training, but redoing the way that we do this training,

00:51.380 --> 00:55.160
the way that the whole experience, the way that we hold everyone accountable, the way

00:55.160 --> 01:01.080
that we track out the progress of everybody, the way that the content is delivered.

01:01.080 --> 01:07.040
I'm really, really excited about it, and it's ironic because the way that we planned on

01:07.040 --> 01:14.280
doing it seemed kind of outside the box, and it seemed a bit weird because I hadn't seen

01:14.280 --> 01:19.440
anybody do it, and I got to give credit to Aaron because Aaron's the one that initially

01:19.440 --> 01:24.480
came with the idea, and then I was like, okay, I'm with you, even though it's not the way

01:24.600 --> 01:28.800
that anybody I've seen is doing it, none of the big guys that whatever.

01:28.800 --> 01:38.800
And then, I had ... there's somebody I really, really respect that has a very, very expensive

01:38.800 --> 01:48.160
program, a $30,000 plus program, and I found out they're using this exact same kind of

01:48.160 --> 01:52.240
system that we're going to be using, so I'm very, very excited, and just before anyone

01:52.320 --> 01:56.400
asks, because I know you guys are excited, it's going to be out sometime in quarter one,

01:56.400 --> 02:03.040
okay? Now, I'm not sure. I'm giving myself those three months just so that I have proper time.

02:03.040 --> 02:07.520
I don't just want to fling something out. I want to have this thing be proper, so that's the goal.

02:08.080 --> 02:11.840
That means that it could come out the last day of March. It also could come out sometime in

02:11.840 --> 02:18.320
January. It could come out sometime in February. My goal is to get it done as quickly as possible,

02:18.320 --> 02:23.280
as well as make sure that it is properly done. So, for those of you that are sitting there going,

02:23.280 --> 02:28.560
I'm going to wait until version 3.0. Guys, there is going to be nothing in version 3.0

02:28.560 --> 02:33.040
that is going to be some magic bullet that's going to make you a millionaire, okay?

02:33.040 --> 02:39.360
There are people in this group, aka Ryan Dalton, that have used the information that is here right

02:39.360 --> 02:44.400
now. That is, he's at $87,000 per month. There's another person I want to give a shout out to

02:44.400 --> 02:50.240
really quick, Mr. Drew Wolber, who messaged me yesterday. We were talking, and he sent me a

02:51.440 --> 02:59.360
screenshot of his, I think it was his Stripe account. He is approaching $50,000 per month,

02:59.360 --> 03:04.560
and he just started. I was like, how did Drew join? I went in, I looked, he joined just over

03:04.560 --> 03:09.600
a year ago, okay? So, for anyone sitting there going, oh, there's nothing missing. The training

03:10.160 --> 03:14.960
is the same training, exactly what I used to get to Seven Figures. It's what Ryan's used to get the

03:14.960 --> 03:19.360
Seven Figure run rate. It's what Drew used to get to $50,000. It's what Juan Finesse used to get to

03:19.360 --> 03:24.480
$40,000. It's what Mike Veas used to get to $40,000. There's nothing missing, but I am excited to give

03:24.480 --> 03:29.840
you guys something and deliver it differently that's outside the box, that's going to be a bit,

03:30.800 --> 03:33.840
it's going to be a breath of fresh air. So, I just don't want you guys to sit around going,

03:33.840 --> 03:37.840
I'm going to wait until the next one. No, go get some money. Go make some money right now. Go get

03:37.840 --> 03:44.960
deals. Don't take your foot off the gas right now. It's December, but this is the perfect time

03:44.960 --> 03:48.320
to put your foot on the gas, stomp on some throats, and go make some money, okay?

03:49.120 --> 03:53.120
That said, I was looking at the training yesterday as I was going through version 2.0,

03:54.400 --> 04:00.880
and I was looking, and we have our core training, which is digital landlords, which is how to get

04:00.880 --> 04:06.560
the deal all the way to the sales FAQ, the ads FAQ, and then how to build the website, how to

04:06.560 --> 04:10.560
rank the website, all of the technical stuff, okay, which we're going to be adding a lot more

04:10.560 --> 04:17.280
information to on version 3.0. And I remembered that we have this other section called the premium

04:17.280 --> 04:21.280
sales training library, which obviously I, of course, always knew that because I have a little

04:21.280 --> 04:26.080
reminder for myself every week or every month to try and add new content to that as much as possible.

04:27.040 --> 04:34.400
And I realized out of the 700 people, whatever, only 200 people, 220 or something people are

04:34.400 --> 04:40.720
actually have access to the premium sales training library. So if you want, let me just

04:40.720 --> 04:48.160
tell you this really quick. The premium sales training library is a compilation. It's not

04:48.160 --> 04:51.600
done yet. It's ever evolving. It's ever being added to. It's something that I've started

04:52.560 --> 04:59.520
creating and having a lot of fun with. This is 10 years of sales experience

05:00.240 --> 05:04.480
in distilled into a training. Okay. And there's multiple videos. There's going to be more

05:04.480 --> 05:10.000
content added to get access to the premium sales training library. You need to be paid in full your

05:10.000 --> 05:15.520
tuition, the cost of entering this program. Some of you guys joined when we were still doing

05:15.520 --> 05:20.800
internal payment programs or you guys use other funding sources. You need to be paid in full

05:21.360 --> 05:26.800
with me. And if you are, you get access, you are granted access. You have the right to access

05:26.800 --> 05:31.200
this premium sales training library, but it's shocking because less than a third of the people

05:31.760 --> 05:36.320
in this program have access to the premium sales training library. And I know that there's

05:36.320 --> 05:41.920
way more, probably double or double and a half that have paid in full. So if you guys have paid in full

05:43.120 --> 05:50.160
message Aaron or fix it Felix and get access to the premium sales training library. If you have

05:50.160 --> 05:54.960
not, and you would like access to it, go and get paid. What I was going to let you guys know is

05:54.960 --> 06:02.640
right now it's December 3rd. There's 28 days left in the month. And anything like if you were to go

06:02.640 --> 06:08.160
and you had like a thousand bucks left, anything that you do spend on this, because you're going

06:08.160 --> 06:11.920
to spend it anyway, you can actually write it off as a tax write off. I don't know if you guys

06:11.920 --> 06:15.280
understand this, but you can write it off as a tax write off. They can give you a break on your

06:15.280 --> 06:20.640
taxes. So if you guys are people that are on like a payment plan, just get it paid off and write it

06:20.640 --> 06:24.000
off on your taxes and get access to the premium sales training library, quit kicking the can down

06:24.000 --> 06:30.720
the road. Okay. So that is going to be continually added onto that is 10 over 10 years. It's 11 years

06:30.720 --> 06:36.720
of knowledge right here in my brain that I'm trying to put into a mini course that's ever evolving,

06:36.720 --> 06:41.760
ever changing, ever being added onto. And as part of this program, as long as you are paid in full,

06:41.760 --> 06:46.320
that is the premium sales training library. So if you do not have access and you are paid in full,

06:46.320 --> 06:49.920
then reach out to Aaron. And if you are not paid in full, get freaking paid in full,

06:49.920 --> 06:55.760
get access to everything and go and check it out. Secondly, for those of you that have not

06:55.760 --> 07:01.440
started playing around with the rank and rent engine tools, no problem. You don't have to use

07:01.440 --> 07:07.280
it. It's, it's not required. It's not something that you have to have. I will tell you that based

07:07.280 --> 07:11.520
on, I know Ryan came on last week. I was traveling coming back from Dubai. And so thank you, Ryan,

07:11.520 --> 07:18.560
for doing that. But we are so cool because we get to control this tool. We like literally as we,

07:18.560 --> 07:22.880
my team goes through it, Francesca will go through the tool and she's like, Hey, I think

07:22.880 --> 07:28.160
that this little button needs to be put over here to make it easier to drop down the menu and do

07:28.160 --> 07:33.840
this. And I'm like, awesome, put it in a document, put it in a loom, send it to Ryan. And every single

07:33.840 --> 07:38.960
week, every single five days we're sending a loom to Ryan. He's like noted and he goes in,

07:38.960 --> 07:44.960
he talks to the developer and we're changing it. So we get to literally build this tool as we go

07:44.960 --> 07:48.480
and we get to add into it. One of the things that I really, really wanted to see, and I talked to

07:48.480 --> 07:52.880
Ryan about is like, dude, we got to make sure that there's a better, more in-depth way to look at

07:52.880 --> 07:58.480
backlinks, right? And of course we wanted to come out with version 1.0 as soon as possible, as long

07:58.480 --> 08:03.520
as the product was good enough. And we did. And I said, and we're going to have, you know, our tool

08:03.520 --> 08:08.080
right now, it'll tell you how many backlinks, it'll tell you domain authority, a few different

08:08.080 --> 08:12.480
things, but it doesn't really give you the backlink profile in depth. We need something that's at

08:12.480 --> 08:19.520
least of the caliber of mangled. So talk to Ryan, he talked to the developers and we are right now

08:19.520 --> 08:27.360
adding a backlink feature that's going to be as good as mangles right inside of the tool, the same

08:27.360 --> 08:31.440
tool that's going to be your CRM, the same tool that's going to be your due diligence, the same

08:31.440 --> 08:35.360
tool that's going to do everything. And I'm super, super excited about it. So that said guys,

08:35.360 --> 08:43.840
guys, if you haven't already, if you haven't heard this, RankinRanEngine is going to be our go-to tool,

08:43.840 --> 08:48.160
version 3.0. All of our training is going to have RankinRanEngine. We're going to be using

08:48.160 --> 08:53.840
RankinRanEngine to do the search, the search volume. We're going to be doing RankinRanEngine

08:54.800 --> 08:59.760
to do the, you know, check out our competitors, look at their backlink profiles. And if you have

08:59.760 --> 09:07.520
not already, check that out. Now there is a code. Ryan sent it to me yesterday and I don't know

09:07.520 --> 09:16.960
where it's at. Let's see here. Okay, here's the code for those of you. Also, by the way, for those

09:16.960 --> 09:20.640
of you that are not in the U.S., that is our next thing that we're looking at is how do we get this

09:20.640 --> 09:27.520
into as many countries outside of the U.S. as possible. So just so you have an idea, we are

09:27.520 --> 09:32.240
working on that now. So I'm going to drop the code really quick and then let's get into this call.

09:32.240 --> 09:37.200
And I don't know where it's at. Here's the code. Well, actually, you know what? You guys message me.

09:37.200 --> 09:41.760
If you guys are interested in RankinRanEngine, message me. I'll send you the code and that's

09:41.760 --> 09:46.160
going to give you a little discount for the first couple months to check out that tool. But anyway,

09:46.160 --> 09:50.560
I'm having so much fun with that tool. I'm doing everything inside of it. I'm not, we got rid of

09:50.560 --> 09:58.240
SEMrush. We got rid of Mangools. We got rid of every single thing. Ahrefs, whatever. We have a

09:58.240 --> 10:03.040
suite of tools. We're paying 300 bucks a month, something like that, just for like basic tools.

10:03.040 --> 10:09.120
And now everything's in one little place. Okay. So that said, guys, that's all I wanted to cover.

10:09.120 --> 10:17.440
We got Richard Martez on. We got Ritu on. We've got Shane Noble. We've got, let's see, Eric already

10:17.440 --> 10:22.160
said hi to Eric. Kirk, no, AiraRare is not available in the UK yet, but we are coming.

10:22.160 --> 10:28.720
We are coming. Let me let Zach in really quick. And as I do that, let's see one second. Freaking

10:28.720 --> 10:44.320
cold in here today. Zach Powell. What's up, Nick? How's it going, man? It's going great, bro. I'm

10:44.320 --> 10:47.680
freezing. I'm going to turn up my heat a little bit while you give yourself a little intro. Give

10:47.680 --> 10:54.320
me about 10 seconds, dude. I'm dying. Hold on. Sounds great. Yeah. I'm excited to be on today.

10:55.600 --> 11:06.080
He said quick intro. I joined Digital Landlords two years ago and now I just love helping people

11:06.080 --> 11:13.840
grow their businesses. So that's what I'm about. Today I'm going to talk about leverage,

11:13.840 --> 11:19.760
which I'm stoked on. I've created a ton of leverage through hiring and building a team.

11:20.400 --> 11:24.800
So great topic for today. I'm stoked. Yeah, bro. Appreciate you being on.

11:26.480 --> 11:31.920
Always a treat to have Zach Powell on. Zach, what's your latest revenue, Mark? I know last

11:31.920 --> 11:41.120
time we talked, it was just over 50,000. Yeah, we're at like 57,000. But there's other,

11:41.200 --> 11:48.720
there's like a ads kind of arm we're adding on to. And so, yeah, it's maybe all together 65 or so.

11:49.520 --> 11:58.320
Amazing. Okay. 65,000. Not bad for somebody who was making just around $6,000 two years ago at a

11:58.320 --> 12:06.560
job. Yeah. Big difference. Yeah, that's crazy, bro. Big difference. How's the new house, dude?

12:06.560 --> 12:12.160
You still enjoying it? Yeah, we call it the office because it's like a house that we work

12:12.160 --> 12:16.320
out of like some team members in the US. We all just come to this house on an acre and

12:16.880 --> 12:23.760
it's like catching the back and then work out of the house. It's fun. That's cool. What was I going

12:23.760 --> 12:30.480
to ask you? Let's see. Oh, did you end up getting rid of the office office since you moved into the

12:30.480 --> 12:38.560
house? Yeah, we were just renting that. So now we own this like acre kind of house office setup.

12:38.560 --> 12:44.560
That's cool. Pretty, pretty fun. I remember when I first moved to St. George here, I was living in

12:44.560 --> 12:49.280
Cedar City and it was cold and I came down, we're looking at houses and there was this guy, we went

12:49.280 --> 12:55.200
and looked at this house and we went through the garage and he had like all these cars out front.

12:55.200 --> 13:00.560
We went through the garage and he literally had like cubicles set up in his garage and he had like

13:00.560 --> 13:07.040
his entire, he's like an engineer architect. He had like a 10-man team in his garage with fans

13:07.040 --> 13:10.720
and the whole thing. Dude, I thought it was the coolest thing ever. I was like, bro, this guy,

13:10.720 --> 13:15.360
this cat's like literally working out of his house. This is foreign, by the way. This isn't now,

13:15.360 --> 13:19.520
like everyone works out the house now, but back in the day when you've knew somebody that worked

13:19.520 --> 13:27.040
from home, it was like, you know, it was really cool. It was like unattainable. So it's exciting.

13:27.040 --> 13:32.240
But yeah, dude, that's what's possible. I was on yesterday before we get into it and I was like,

13:32.240 --> 13:39.120
I just jumped on really quick. I was looking at my goals and it reminded me like, dude, your whole

13:39.120 --> 13:43.840
life, and this is a reminder for anyone on this call, that your entire life can change in a year.

13:43.840 --> 13:50.880
Like you put your head down and you focus on one thing and you grow it and your entire life can

13:50.880 --> 13:56.080
change in a year. You can go from barely making it, you know, budgeting what vacations are going on

13:56.080 --> 14:03.280
to being able to buy properties, you know, buy your wife whatever car they want, get into a new

14:03.280 --> 14:09.120
house and like your whole identity changes. So it's exciting because we have the tools

14:09.120 --> 14:15.440
in front of us to do that. It's just up to us now. So one of the things that is part of this

14:15.440 --> 14:22.160
business that I wish I had done way sooner was create leverage because I was Mr. like,

14:23.040 --> 14:28.800
you know, solopreneur, do it myself, figure everything out on my own because I could beat

14:28.800 --> 14:34.400
my chest, whatever. And then I realized that the real players, the people that are actually scaling,

14:35.040 --> 14:39.760
they are using other people because there's different types of leverage. Zach's going to

14:39.760 --> 14:44.640
talk about this today, but one of those pieces of leverage is human capital and using other people.

14:44.640 --> 14:48.880
And so everyone, not everyone, but I get some messages sometimes like, when do you recommend

14:48.880 --> 14:53.440
hiring? Okay. And that's one of the things I'm going to ask Zach, his opinion on this. My opinion

14:53.440 --> 15:01.040
is as soon as possible. Okay. So anyway, that said, Zach, I'm going to give you a co-host. That way

15:01.040 --> 15:05.440
you can share anything you want, but we're going to be talking about hiring, creating leverage.

15:05.440 --> 15:10.400
And that is something Zach has done very, very well. It's allowed him to go. Where was it? You

15:10.400 --> 15:17.280
were just on a surfing trip. Was that in Hawaii? No coaster. I was in Hawaii, Hawaii for a month

15:17.280 --> 15:23.840
and then Nicaragua for a week. And then actually this last weekend, they opened a manmade wave,

15:23.840 --> 15:29.040
like 10 minutes from my house in Arizona. And so I was surfing that on like their VIP opening day.

15:29.040 --> 15:34.080
And it was awesome surfing in the desert in Arizona. So that's surfing across the globe,

15:34.080 --> 15:38.400
man. It's, it's been fun. That's amazing, bro. I love that. And that's, that's,

15:38.400 --> 15:42.320
that's the beauty of the business. All right, bro. You got, you got hosts. Let's, let's get into it,

15:42.320 --> 15:46.080
man. You, I'm going to, rather than me direct this, I'm going to have you direct it because

15:46.080 --> 15:53.600
you're the expert and I'll just kind of chip in where I see fit. Sounds great, man. So yeah,

15:53.600 --> 15:59.840
talking about hiring, I think first it's a mindset thing we got to get over. Like you mentioned,

15:59.840 --> 16:04.720
so I'm going to get into that. I'll share my screen, how I think about hiring and then also

16:04.720 --> 16:11.200
share like how I actually do hiring and kind of my playbook for that. So let me share my screen

16:11.840 --> 16:14.720
and I'll walk you through how I think about it.

16:23.600 --> 16:33.280
All right. We good. You guys see this? I can see a white, yeah, a whiteboard.

16:34.880 --> 16:40.720
Whiteboard. Okay. Here we go. If you guys have like journals or notes, like you're going to want to

16:40.720 --> 16:45.120
write this down. It's pretty awesome stuff. That's opened my mind a lot. So the first one,

16:45.120 --> 16:50.560
there's three things I'll show you real quick. And then I'll stop sharing, but the first one

16:50.560 --> 16:58.000
to talk about real quick, it's called your buyback rate. And this will open your mind a lot. Buyback

16:58.000 --> 17:05.200
rate. What is buyback rate and how do you calculate it? So essentially the reason we want our buyback

17:05.200 --> 17:13.920
rate is you want to grow a company that you don't grow to hate. You want to grow a company that you

17:13.920 --> 17:19.840
enjoy running. And so you don't want to hire, to actually grow your business. You want to hire,

17:20.480 --> 17:26.800
to buy back your time. And I'll explain what this means, but the first step is calculating your

17:26.800 --> 17:34.320
buyback rate. So buyback rate, the first thing is your income. This is like, if you have a job right

17:34.320 --> 17:40.320
now, that income counts and the income from your business and all the write-offs that are like

17:41.200 --> 17:48.000
for you. Basically all the money you have, like you guys know what I'm talking about when

17:48.560 --> 17:52.640
you're buying things, you would have bought in any way, but you buy through your business.

17:54.400 --> 17:59.600
All of the income, all of the financial gain you receive from your job, from your business,

17:59.600 --> 18:08.480
from everything goes into your buyback rate. So income divided by 2000 hours. Why 2000 hours?

18:08.480 --> 18:14.320
2000 hours because there's about 50 working weeks in the year, 40 hours in a week. That equals 2000

18:14.320 --> 18:21.920
working hours in an average year. So divide your income by 2000 hours. That gives you what

18:21.920 --> 18:30.240
your time is worth per hour, dollars an hour. One of the biggest issues with hiring is people don't

18:30.240 --> 18:36.320
think their time is actually worth what it's worth. And so they're doing $5 tasks when their

18:36.320 --> 18:41.680
time is worth $100 an hour. And it just absolutely makes no sense. And so this will help it kind of

18:41.680 --> 18:48.800
become clear for you guys. So let's just use an example. Let's say your income with your W-2,

18:48.800 --> 18:55.600
your job, your company, like everything, whatever. Let's say it's 100,000. 100k divided by 2000 hours

18:56.160 --> 19:04.400
that equals $50 an hour. We'll just use that an example. So your time is worth $50 an hour.

19:05.280 --> 19:12.400
And so are you valuing your time at that rate? So that's the first piece. Then you take what

19:12.400 --> 19:17.040
your time is worth per hour. And guys, figure this out right now. Look at the past 12 months.

19:17.040 --> 19:22.480
Calculate what your income has been the past 12 months. Divide that by 2000 hours. Get your

19:22.480 --> 19:28.800
buyback rate right now. Once you have what your time is worth per hour, then you take that $50 an

19:28.800 --> 19:42.400
hour divided by four. That would be $12.50. Why divide by four? Because $12.50 is what you can hire

19:42.400 --> 19:49.600
somebody for and get a four times return on your investment. So if you hire someone for $12.50 an

19:49.600 --> 19:56.480
hour or less, you automatically have a four times return on your investment if they take things off

19:56.480 --> 20:05.680
your plate, if they do things that you would have done. And that's the key. So in this example,

20:05.680 --> 20:16.000
let's say this person makes $100,000 a year, their buyback rate is $12.50 an hour. And so like

20:19.360 --> 20:25.120
when I first did this, it kind of blew my mind. A couple years ago, I calculated this and I was

20:25.120 --> 20:32.000
like, Whoa, my buyback rate is over $30 an hour. And then I looked at what I was doing each day.

20:32.000 --> 20:38.800
And I was like, why am I doing $5 an hour tasks when my time is worth over $30 an hour?

20:38.800 --> 20:46.160
It doesn't make sense. So sometimes we got to see. Go ahead. So anything, just to clarify,

20:46.160 --> 20:54.960
so anything that is, just explain again, the $12.50. So anything that's less than that,

20:54.960 --> 20:59.760
you should be hiring out. Explain that piece. Once you calculate your buyback rate,

20:59.760 --> 21:05.200
what does that mean? And what should we do with that information? Because I saw a few

21:05.200 --> 21:14.160
people that just jumped on. Awesome question. So basically, anything you do that you can pay

21:14.160 --> 21:21.440
someone $12.50 or less to do, pay them to do that. Get that off your plate, buy back your time.

21:23.280 --> 21:26.800
And this will go into the next piece here. That's an awesome question. The next piece

21:26.800 --> 21:31.520
is the time and energy audit. So this is step one. Step two is the time and energy audit. And then

21:31.520 --> 21:37.520
we'll go to step three. So step two answers that question in depth really well. So I'll just hop

21:37.520 --> 21:45.600
right into that. We'll do the next thing, time and energy audit. This one's pretty simple,

21:45.600 --> 21:54.560
but profound as well. Time and energy audit. Okay. So hopefully you've calculated your buyback rate.

21:54.560 --> 21:59.040
If you just hopped on, it's your income, everything, all the money that comes to you,

21:59.040 --> 22:04.880
your job, your business, perks, everything, all that. What's the number? Your income per year

22:05.680 --> 22:10.560
divided by 2000 hours, 2000 working hours in a year, gives you your hourly rate,

22:10.560 --> 22:17.760
what you're worth per hour. Divide that then by four. And that is your buyback rate because

22:17.760 --> 22:23.120
you're getting a four times return on your investment. If you hire someone for a fourth

22:23.120 --> 22:27.360
of what you make per hour, you're automatically getting four times return on your investment,

22:27.360 --> 22:34.640
which is awesome. So next question is like, how do I find the things to take off my plate?

22:35.840 --> 22:40.720
Well, this makes it simple. You just do a time and energy audit. So you write down the task

22:41.280 --> 22:47.600
that you're going to do and you write down the value. And what I do on my watch,

22:48.720 --> 22:53.040
I'll pull up and I'll say, Hey, like, you know, start a 15 minute timer and I'll just refresh

22:53.040 --> 22:58.560
it all day. And every 15 minutes I have my running list and I just write down what I did.

22:59.120 --> 23:10.880
Right. So let's say, um, drive to office there that, and then I do a value,

23:10.880 --> 23:17.440
just $1 sign to $4 signs, $4 signs. If it's super valuable, $1 sign. If it's low value

23:17.520 --> 23:24.160
drive to office. Okay. We'll say that's $1 sign. And then, you know, I get to office

23:24.160 --> 23:31.200
deck email, you know, not that valuable $1 sign. And then I do a sales call sales call.

23:31.920 --> 23:37.840
That is like the most valuable thing I do. That is the most valuable thing. And then I train my team,

23:39.760 --> 23:47.120
team training, and that's valuable. Maybe we'll say $3 signs. Right. So from here,

23:47.120 --> 23:53.680
then what you do, the other piece of this is does it. So it's time and energy audit. You're

23:53.680 --> 24:00.480
auditing your time every 15 minutes. Is this thing valuable, not valuable? Um, and then the other

24:00.480 --> 24:08.080
piece that really makes this, um, phenomenal is you audit your energy at the end of those 15 minutes.

24:08.080 --> 24:13.760
Did that task light you up? Did he give you more energy or did it drain your energy? Do you not

24:13.760 --> 24:20.560
like doing that thing? So drive to the office. Um, you know, I'm going to do email, email, boom.

24:21.120 --> 24:26.080
I'm going to highlight that red, that drains my energy sales call. That actually gives me energy

24:26.080 --> 24:32.000
because I love talking to people, team training. That gives me energy driving to the office. Um,

24:32.000 --> 24:37.040
that drains energy unless I'm going to say, okay, tomorrow when I drive to the office,

24:37.040 --> 24:42.400
I'm going to actually drive to the office and use my car as my university. I'm going to like be

24:42.400 --> 24:47.200
listening to the digital landlords trainings. I'm going to be like learning while I'm driving,

24:47.200 --> 24:54.720
drive to office. We'll do and learn. Boom. Now this value just went up and I enjoy it now. Okay.

24:54.720 --> 25:00.160
So, um, this is the time and energy audit.

25:02.560 --> 25:09.440
You audit your time and your energy. And what happens is you do this for a week and then you

25:09.440 --> 25:14.640
start noticing all the things that are red and drain your energy and that are $1 signs.

25:14.640 --> 25:20.160
And all of those things are the things that you see. How the heck can I stop doing that

25:20.720 --> 25:27.040
and pay someone my buyback rate or less to do that for me? And now you have the exact

25:27.040 --> 25:34.560
things you want to hire for. Um, for example, my first hire that I ever hired was a content writer.

25:35.120 --> 25:42.480
Why? Because that drained my energy and I could hire someone, $4 an hour, $5 an hour to do that

25:42.480 --> 25:50.320
for me. And I'm like, why am I spending 10 hours a week writing content? It makes no sense. Right.

25:50.320 --> 25:56.320
Why next thing was building websites. Why am I building websites? So does that make sense?

25:56.320 --> 26:01.600
Everybody, any questions so far? I guess in the chat, like put any takeaways, like what do you,

26:01.600 --> 26:05.360
it's not what's taught, it's what's caught. So like, what do you guys catch in? Like what,

26:05.920 --> 26:10.800
what so far is your biggest takeaway in the chat? Like teach each other, share that.

26:10.800 --> 26:16.880
That when, uh, when you're doing the energy and time audit, do you, you write down,

26:16.880 --> 26:21.360
I've done this before, but I haven't really done it as specific as you, which is like

26:21.360 --> 26:28.480
drive to the office, like every single thing. Um, how do you, when it's stuff like that, do you like,

26:28.480 --> 26:33.760
okay, let's say that you hate driving to the office. You hate, uh, you know, going and getting

26:33.760 --> 26:38.080
lunch because both those things kind of like suck your energy and they're not really, I mean,

26:38.080 --> 26:42.880
they're not providing money. They're just taking money. How do you get like, have you considered

26:42.880 --> 26:47.600
hiring somebody or different solutions for that? Like, let's say driving to the office, what do you

26:47.600 --> 26:52.000
do in that situation? You're like, okay, maybe I can't hire somebody, but I can start working from

26:52.000 --> 26:56.480
home. Or you start thinking outside the box like that. Like what are some solutions to it instead

26:56.480 --> 27:03.120
of just hiring or I'm talking about the things maybe outside of the business tasks, but that

27:03.120 --> 27:05.120
you still have to do that are draining your energy.

27:07.360 --> 27:14.240
That's an awesome question. Um, I think the first step is being aware, right? Like the first thing

27:14.240 --> 27:18.400
that I would say you want to be problem aware. So the time and energy audit makes you problem

27:18.400 --> 27:23.920
aware. And when you're aware and you write it down, then your brain starts working on it. And

27:23.920 --> 27:30.480
you're like, how could I use my time more effectively? People that make millions and

27:30.480 --> 27:34.720
millions of dollars a year, use their time much more effectively than people that make

27:34.720 --> 27:41.120
$50,000 a year, right? So if we can look at how we're spending our time, this is actually super

27:41.120 --> 27:47.280
eye opening. Like the first time I did this, the way I spent my time, the way I thought I spent my

27:47.280 --> 27:52.560
time wasn't actually how I spent my time. So like, I challenge you guys to actually do this and

27:52.560 --> 28:00.400
you'll realize like, whoa, I spend way more time than I thought, um, doing content writing or

28:00.400 --> 28:06.480
building websites or these things that if it's on a computer, you can hire someone around the

28:06.480 --> 28:13.040
world to do it. Um, and this will open your eyes. One thought on that with it's, it's not necessarily

28:13.040 --> 28:19.600
hiring a VA from, from online jobs, but if you guys are like sitting at your house and you're

28:19.600 --> 28:24.160
like, well, it's time for me to get lunch and you're driving to go get food because you want

28:24.160 --> 28:31.040
to save $5 from a door dash fees. You guys are being very, very short-sighted because you can

28:31.040 --> 28:37.520
literally spend, I can order Chipotle. You could count to 12. I can order it in like 12 seconds

28:37.520 --> 28:42.480
and it would show up at my door and I saved like 45 minutes a day. And yes, instead of my Chipotle

28:42.480 --> 28:49.440
bowl being $8, it's like 18 with delivery fee in the tip, but like the cost me 10 bucks. I just

28:49.440 --> 28:55.360
bought 45 minutes of my time for $10 and it doesn't take me off task. I don't get stuck in

28:55.360 --> 29:00.720
traffic. I don't get caught by my buddy. That's like, Hey bro, let me pick your brain, you know,

29:00.720 --> 29:05.440
and you're not have to be rude. And then you get distracted. So it's the same concept, even though

29:05.440 --> 29:10.160
you're not necessarily hiring a VA in the Philippines, you're hiring a door dash person

29:10.160 --> 29:15.920
and it's costing you 10 extra dollars every day, but that saves you so much time. So just a thought.

29:16.480 --> 29:21.200
That's awesome because it's not just employees, right? It's how it's like, you want to design

29:21.200 --> 29:28.560
your life and to be aware first, you need to know how much your time is worth and then you need to

29:28.560 --> 29:33.840
know how you're using your time. Time is the most precious resource, right? Like how are you using

29:33.840 --> 29:44.560
it? So when you're thinking about that, like the reason I want to show you guys this is the way

29:44.560 --> 29:52.720
is the way you spend your time isn't how you think you spend your time. Generally, we think

29:52.720 --> 29:59.120
that we are much more effective than we actually are. So this is massively eye opening. So I

29:59.120 --> 30:04.960
challenge you guys to do this. Okay. The third piece that'll kind of bring this all together,

30:05.520 --> 30:10.800
it's called the buyback loop and it looks like this. Here we go.

30:10.800 --> 30:13.680
It looks like this.

30:17.680 --> 30:23.280
An arrow right there. So what happens, there's three steps. You audit your time with the time

30:23.280 --> 30:32.000
and energy audit. You transfer the low value and energy draining things,

30:32.000 --> 30:41.280
transfer to another person, to AI, like Nick's thing, DoorDash, like you transfer those things

30:41.280 --> 30:49.440
to buy back your time, to get your energy where you want it. And then you fill, you fill your time

30:49.440 --> 30:54.560
with more things that light you up that are green and are four dollar signs more valuable.

30:55.520 --> 31:02.720
And it's a continuous cycle. You audit, transfer, fill, audit, transfer, fill, and you just spiral

31:02.720 --> 31:08.480
upwards. And the momentum comes from the fill. Like you have to fill your time with things that

31:08.480 --> 31:15.280
are more valuable than you used to do. And that's why it's so powerful. So this, this kind of

31:15.280 --> 31:22.080
connects it all. And what happens is right here, this is called the pain line right here. And what

31:22.160 --> 31:34.240
happens, people, you won't grow into pain if it is uncomfortable or, you know, you're not going to

31:35.440 --> 31:39.760
make more sales calls. You're not going to grind harder if you know that that's just going to add

31:39.760 --> 31:46.480
a ton of stress to your life. But what if you know that growing, adding monthly recurring revenue

31:46.480 --> 31:52.720
to your business doesn't make you have to work more and more and more, but you have like the

31:52.720 --> 31:59.840
ability to transfer and fill and you're making more money doing things, doing more of the things

31:59.840 --> 32:06.080
that you like doing. So that kind of connects it all here. You have your buyback rate, you know

32:06.640 --> 32:10.800
what your time is worth, and then you look at how you're spending your time and the energy it gives

32:10.800 --> 32:16.080
you. One thing I haven't said yet either is over time doing these time and energy audits,

32:16.080 --> 32:20.960
you'll realize, oh, I have more energy in the morning or I have more energy at night and then

32:20.960 --> 32:27.520
structure your day accordingly. You know, if you have high value tasks that light you up,

32:27.520 --> 32:36.000
do those when you have a lot of energy and like, you know, use your, your being tuned with your

32:36.000 --> 32:40.800
body and like, no, okay, here's my energy. And then you'll be able to produce better work and

32:40.800 --> 32:47.200
organize your day accordingly. So doing that, and then using this, it's called the buyback loop,

32:47.200 --> 32:53.360
using the buyback loop to audit your time, transfer these low value, energy draining things

32:54.080 --> 33:00.080
to other people. And then the key, the ticket, and people always get this wrong, is they fill

33:00.080 --> 33:08.640
their time with social media, or they fill their time with like, stupid stuff that doesn't push

33:08.640 --> 33:15.440
the needle forward. They fill their time, you know, like, time will expand, and you'll just

33:15.440 --> 33:21.120
take like three hours to do something that you could do in 15 minutes. So the key is fill your

33:21.120 --> 33:28.880
time with these things that are high value that you like doing. And then you build a life that you

33:30.080 --> 33:35.600
you never want to retire from you build a life that you love. So yeah, is that making sense

33:35.600 --> 33:40.480
for everybody or any any questions? Throw them in the chat. There's a couple questions I want to

33:40.480 --> 33:43.840
mention, I want to give you this fun, this really extreme example. So I have a buddy.

33:46.400 --> 33:51.360
He is a real estate agent. And he's been for as long as I've known him since about 2018,

33:51.360 --> 33:56.000
this guy makes like, he makes over seven figures in commissions as a real estate agent, which is

33:56.000 --> 34:01.280
very, very impressive, right? It's very difficult to find anyone that can make a seven figures

34:01.280 --> 34:05.280
outside of owning their own business. And yeah, technically, you own your own business is real

34:05.280 --> 34:10.240
estate. This guy's in St. George, Utah. He's not in Hollywood. He's he's makes he's mixed seven

34:10.240 --> 34:15.600
figures doing real estate. This guy's a machine, dude. He's on the phone, I think like four hours

34:15.600 --> 34:20.560
a day just cold calling. And I remember we used to do this meet, we'd meet like once a week have

34:20.560 --> 34:27.360
lunch, like a group of us. And he was like, Yeah, I'm thinking about like, how do I can save time

34:27.360 --> 34:32.880
and how I can because he makes money when he's on the phone, like that's it. And so what he did is

34:32.880 --> 34:39.680
he bought a Sprinter van, he wrapped it with his logo to you know, whatever. And then he set up an

34:39.680 --> 34:44.800
office inside the Sprinter van so that when he's on his way to showings, he can be dialing while

34:44.800 --> 34:51.120
he's on his way to showings. And I was like, dude, that's so gangster. That is so next level that

34:51.120 --> 34:56.000
he's even worried about the 15 minutes in between showing so he can be on his computer and making

34:56.000 --> 35:01.680
those extra five phone calls, which I thought was pretty dang sweet. And sure enough, about a year

35:01.680 --> 35:07.840
and a half later, I noticed his Sprinter van around town like he actually did it. He actually

35:07.840 --> 35:11.120
freaking did it. So that's the kind of an extreme example. But one more thing I want to add.

35:12.640 --> 35:18.240
It's kind of like, what Zach saying is super important about filling the time because it's

35:18.240 --> 35:22.000
like, I don't remember, dude, I think maybe probably one of your missionaries, when we used

35:22.000 --> 35:25.840
to teach people like, hey, if you're going to remove this bad habit, you have to fill it with

35:25.840 --> 35:30.000
something else. Otherwise, it's like a hole, and the hole is going to be filled. So you got to

35:30.000 --> 35:34.480
fill it with something good, or it's going to get filled with something not as good. So make sure

35:34.480 --> 35:40.160
that you're not just leaving these empty gaps. We all know those people that go to the gym for

35:40.160 --> 35:44.560
three hours, and you can get the gym done in 45 minutes to an hour. You don't need to be there

35:44.560 --> 35:48.240
three hours. I don't care who you are. You don't need to be there three hours. An hour is plenty.

35:49.200 --> 35:53.600
So I think that's super, super valuable. One thing I want to ask, Zach, how often do you recommend,

35:54.320 --> 35:59.840
or do you personally do time and energy audits? Is it quarterly, monthly,

35:59.840 --> 36:03.360
once a year? What's your go-to? And then we'll get into some of the questions everyone has.

36:05.760 --> 36:11.120
Yeah, awesome question. I would say quarterly, once you've kind of gotten a good routine,

36:11.120 --> 36:18.160
when you start this out, do like, start now and do it for two weeks, and then adjust. You're going

36:18.160 --> 36:22.320
to make a lot of quick adjustments, and then do another one a couple weeks later, and a couple

36:22.320 --> 36:28.080
weeks later until you feel like you have a good flow. Once you have a good flow of how you're

36:28.080 --> 36:33.840
spending your time each day, and your routine, and it's dialed in, then you can go to quarterly.

36:33.840 --> 36:40.000
But if you ever, the general thing is whenever you feel like, oh man, you know when you have

36:40.000 --> 36:46.320
that feeling bogged down, or you're not stoked on what you're doing, do another time and energy

36:46.320 --> 36:50.480
audit, and figure out why. Figure out why you're not completely stoked on your life.

36:51.200 --> 36:56.320
Because you should be. You're a business owner. If you're doing it right, if you're owning your

36:56.320 --> 37:01.360
business in the right way, we should be like the happiest people on earth, because we own our time.

37:01.360 --> 37:08.160
We can work from anywhere. It's awesome. We can use the money the company generates to live the

37:08.160 --> 37:12.880
best life we want to live, and keep making more money at the same time, if we do it right. So

37:14.080 --> 37:17.920
that's kind of my thoughts on that. So you would recommend everyone

37:18.880 --> 37:22.000
two weeks, go do a two week energy. Are you doing this on weekends too?

37:24.160 --> 37:30.480
Oh yeah, yep. And I actually have like, I made it into a Google Sheet, so if anybody wants that,

37:30.480 --> 37:36.160
just like direct message me, time and energy audit, and then I'll send you a link. You can

37:36.160 --> 37:41.040
make a copy of mine, and you know, do it in the Google Sheet. But honestly, it's as simple as

37:41.040 --> 37:47.200
this. You can just do it in a notepad, and just write it. Super cool, super easy. But

37:48.560 --> 37:52.880
let me stop to share here too. You're good. I'm going to write direct message Zach Powell,

37:52.880 --> 38:00.880
time energy audit to get his Google Sheet. And yeah, the other thing though is, I guess that's

38:00.880 --> 38:07.120
just all of that is for the mindset, right? People have issues hiring because they're like,

38:07.120 --> 38:12.240
I can do it, I can do it. It's just human nature. Like you were saying, we all do it, we all hold

38:12.240 --> 38:17.520
on to things too long. But when we look at the numbers, we look at our buyback rate. Oh, shoot,

38:17.520 --> 38:25.440
my time is worth $100 an hour. Now I can hire someone $25 an hour or less, man, I can do,

38:25.440 --> 38:30.640
I can hire someone at that rate to do almost everything I do, right? And you upgrade your

38:30.640 --> 38:35.680
life. And now you're doing way more effective stuff. So doing those three things and helping

38:35.680 --> 38:41.040
those all come together in your mind will give you the confidence and realize it's actually dumb

38:41.040 --> 38:46.160
for me to not hire. And that's what it usually takes for people to get to the point where they

38:46.160 --> 38:52.640
start hiring. And then the issue becomes people are terrible at hiring. And I know we're running

38:52.640 --> 38:59.520
short on time. But the next thing is like, how do you hire? And so I have like a full hiring

38:59.520 --> 39:06.560
playbook of how I get a ton of applicants and dwindle them down automatically without taking

39:06.560 --> 39:13.360
a lot of time to find awesome people to add to my team. So if anybody wants like my hiring

39:13.360 --> 39:18.000
playbook, what I do, just direct message me like the word hiring, and I'll shoot you the link,

39:18.000 --> 39:23.200
I have like a Google Doc of my process. So maybe I'll put that in the chat. But

39:23.200 --> 39:30.880
I'll put it real quick. I'll put Zach for the hiring playbook. And he put this together guys,

39:30.880 --> 39:36.400
for time's sake. And also because he's he's done this a lot. DM Zach Powell for hiring playbook.

39:37.440 --> 39:39.760
Okay. All right. So you don't mind getting blown up?

39:39.760 --> 39:45.040
Yeah. Yeah, it's fine. Everyone can just DM me like I love helping you guys we can

39:45.760 --> 39:52.080
chat whatever. But the biggest thing is like with hiring, most people don't get enough applicants.

39:52.080 --> 39:56.560
That's the number one issue. They don't have a big enough pool of people applying for their jobs.

39:56.560 --> 40:00.960
So then they end up with like a couple applicants and they just pick one and hire someone not good.

40:00.960 --> 40:05.680
So you want a lot of applicants. This is what the hiring playbook shows and shows my process for

40:05.760 --> 40:11.200
getting a ton of applicants and then automatically dwindling those down to the best ones. So it

40:11.200 --> 40:17.040
doesn't take a ton of your time, but you effectively get all the best ones in a group. That's the other

40:17.040 --> 40:21.680
thing people do wrong is like they waste too much time trying to hire. And then it's a pain. And

40:21.680 --> 40:27.360
that's why they don't upgrade and, you know, hire and transfer and fill very well is like it takes

40:27.360 --> 40:33.360
so much time. So my playbook like makes it easy to automatically dwindle it down. And then the third

40:33.360 --> 40:39.680
thing is like they end up with subpar employees because their hiring funnel is so thin, right? So

40:39.680 --> 40:45.440
thick hiring funnel. Now you have the cream of the crop, way better people. When I first started

40:45.440 --> 40:51.120
hiring, I made a lot of bad hires. Now almost every single hire is phenomenal because they align

40:51.120 --> 40:56.000
so well. Like I have this huge pool and they align so well. And I just add phenomenal people to my

40:56.000 --> 41:01.680
team time after time after time. So you want my playbook for how I do that? Just message me hiring.

41:01.680 --> 41:07.280
I'll send it to you. Message me if you want the time and energy audit. These have been like

41:07.280 --> 41:13.760
huge things for me to take it to the next level. And like not just financially because at one point

41:13.760 --> 41:19.120
I was making a lot of money, but kind of hating life. Then I started making more money and loving

41:19.120 --> 41:25.440
life more because of these things. So if you want to build a business that you never want to retire

41:25.440 --> 41:32.800
from, that's how you do it, which is fun to think about. A couple of questions that were a little

41:32.800 --> 41:37.760
more specific. Luke Hill has a question. How do you trust VAs with things like cPanel to build

41:37.760 --> 41:44.880
out the site? Because it sounds like he's using WordPress. I know that like on Weebly and stuff,

41:44.880 --> 41:50.240
you can give limited access. And I know you use Duda, but how do you deal? Let's just make it a

41:50.240 --> 41:55.520
more general question. How do you hire or trust VAs and stuff with a little more sensitive

41:55.520 --> 42:00.800
information? I think most tools will allow you to give limited access. I don't use WordPress,

42:00.800 --> 42:06.400
but I've used it a teeny amount to know that you're talking about WordPress. Any thoughts on that?

42:08.560 --> 42:16.640
Yeah, awesome question. Just as with anything, you build trust over time. So when you hire someone

42:17.120 --> 42:22.320
through the hiring process, you've gained trust. And now you have your onboarding, right? You

42:22.320 --> 42:28.480
should have an onboarding sequence of video recordings of yourself doing things and training

42:28.480 --> 42:34.720
them. Video recordings of you training your team, they go through these things. And as you work with

42:34.720 --> 42:40.480
them, you build trust. They start trusting you as the owner, someone that's going to pay their

42:40.480 --> 42:45.200
salary, someone to work for that you're going to invest in them, care about them, have a good

42:45.200 --> 42:49.360
company to work at, they're going to build trust in you. And you're going to build trust in them.

42:49.360 --> 42:52.960
You're going to see how quickly they respond in Slack. You're going to see how quickly they do

42:52.960 --> 42:59.760
things. You're going to see the quality of their work very quickly. And so like Nick's saying,

42:59.760 --> 43:06.320
you can give them the all back access. And then over time, as you build trust, you give them more.

43:06.320 --> 43:12.080
You know, now I have an assistant I've worked with for over two years. I just give her my

43:12.080 --> 43:17.200
passwords to everything. We have like 100% trust. Yeah, yeah, she could rob me and steal

43:17.200 --> 43:22.240
a couple thousand bucks. But it's like, yeah, she lost her job. Would you steal from your boss

43:22.240 --> 43:26.960
thousands of dollars? No, probably not. Because you would lose your job. Are they going to steal

43:26.960 --> 43:30.800
hundreds of dollars from me? No, because then they're going to lose their job. Like, it's just,

43:31.680 --> 43:35.840
that's like another mental barrier that people have is like, I can't give this because I don't

43:35.840 --> 43:41.280
trust the person will give them things that they can't mess up. Or like if they mess up,

43:41.280 --> 43:51.120
it's low. It's like low, what do you call it? Low? Yeah, yeah, it's it's it's low. Yeah, low,

43:51.120 --> 43:57.760
low risk, basically. Yeah, low risk. That's the risk. That's the low risk. That's what you want.

43:57.760 --> 44:02.320
And then just build and give them more and more and more. So one thing, awesome question. It's

44:02.320 --> 44:07.600
another mindset thing. One thing too, from our training, we've had Joe Jonas, the founder of

44:07.600 --> 44:15.680
onlinejobs.ph on like twice. And I remember that he said, like he has employed his VA's have access

44:15.680 --> 44:21.040
to literally everything, including his bank, including his credit cards. But what's so

44:21.040 --> 44:26.800
interesting is that in the Philippines, this is such a cultural thing. There you're people that

44:26.800 --> 44:31.200
mean, yes, there's going to be some bad people, but people that are on that site, for the most part,

44:31.200 --> 44:39.360
like it's culturally unacceptable to basically ruin your boss or go backstab or not be loyal.

44:39.360 --> 44:43.200
Like loyalty is a big thing in the Philippines. One of the reasons it makes such a good place

44:43.200 --> 44:49.200
for VA. So I've personally never had any bad experiences in terms of like, I've never even

44:49.200 --> 44:57.040
had a VA from the Philippines try and do content that's been plagiarized, which is still a bad

44:57.040 --> 45:04.000
thing, but it's low on the totem pole of like offensive, illegal activity. I've never even

45:04.000 --> 45:08.720
caught anyone doing, you know, plagiarized content. So I don't think it's something you

45:08.720 --> 45:14.080
should super have to worry about. And I also remember in, I remember in a four hour workweek,

45:14.080 --> 45:18.880
Tim Ferriss talking about when he was building a supplement company, when he used to give his VA's

45:18.880 --> 45:23.040
like, basically they would be able to make decisions at anything below a hundred dollars.

45:23.680 --> 45:27.680
So you have to, at some point guys, you have to relinquish control. If you think you're going to

45:27.680 --> 45:33.200
control every aspect of your business forever, then you're not going to grow. It's the exact

45:33.200 --> 45:40.160
saying. It's a mindset thing. And it's a limiting belief because you, you know, and this is one of

45:40.160 --> 45:48.080
the things I heard really quick is we give ourselves as business owners, as entrepreneurs,

45:48.640 --> 45:53.040
you know, we give ourselves slack when we fail because like, well, we learned a lesson,

45:53.040 --> 45:57.520
but we don't give our employees that same slack. Sometimes we expect them to be a hundred percent

45:57.520 --> 46:00.880
perfect. And like they're humans, they're going to mess up. They're going to forget to do this and

46:00.880 --> 46:04.480
that. You have to expect that it's not going to be perfect. They're not going to do, they're not

46:04.480 --> 46:08.720
going to, you can't expect them to carry a hundred percent as much as you because they don't own a

46:08.720 --> 46:12.640
hundred percent of your business. But that's not the goal. You want to get somebody that can do it

46:13.200 --> 46:18.160
80% or better as good as you. And then you hire it out. That's, that's the game. That's the entire

46:18.160 --> 46:24.080
game. So real quick, couple of questions. Jason Adams says, this is why I use Instacart grocery

46:24.080 --> 46:28.640
shopping is low value energy sucking and time consuming. Jason, that's because you've never

46:28.640 --> 46:33.280
been to a Harman's. Just kidding. But I do love, I do love, you know, it's funny thing about me,

46:33.280 --> 46:38.240
and this is one thing we could know. If you have something that's on your list, it's like

46:38.240 --> 46:42.960
low value, but it's high energy. Those are things that you could keep and just kind of

46:42.960 --> 46:48.320
chalk up to like they're your hobbies. Like for me personally, depending on the grocery store,

46:48.320 --> 46:52.960
I don't mind going in grocery store sometimes going into produce. Like it kind of, I kind of

46:52.960 --> 46:58.160
like it. I'm kind of weird like that. But I also know like my dad, if you catch him in a grocery

46:58.160 --> 47:05.280
store, dude, the earth ending tomorrow, like he's done. He's not doing it. Right. So yeah,

47:05.280 --> 47:11.200
that's just that's your investment quadrant, things that light you up, but are low value.

47:11.200 --> 47:15.680
You want to do those things that you're investing in those. It's not your production quadrant, but

47:15.680 --> 47:20.480
you're investing in those things and delegation quadrant, low energy, low money, like get those

47:20.480 --> 47:25.280
off your plate for sure. And dude, I have no problem doing those kinds of things after hours.

47:25.280 --> 47:31.840
I'm not going to do that in the middle of the day, obviously. Nick Kudlick from St. George says,

47:31.840 --> 47:36.640
amazing read, how to buy back your time by Dan Martell. Yes. Phenomenal book. I know you

47:36.640 --> 47:45.280
really like that book, Zach. A lot of these concepts are from that. Jason said he had a

47:45.280 --> 47:49.040
seven figures in recurring revenue as a corporate employee in the investment industry. Then he quit

47:49.040 --> 47:54.240
and started over. Yes. I remember that dude. And good on you, dude. Life's too short. He also said,

47:54.240 --> 48:00.880
Dr. J weightlifting is a waste of time is a book. And he said, dude is jacked over 50 years, 50 years

48:00.880 --> 48:06.880
old too. So check that out. Um, Luke says Kroger has saved so much of my time with delivery. There's

48:06.880 --> 48:12.000
no fee for delivery. It makes no sense to drive. Beautiful. I agree. A hundred percent. So takeaways,

48:12.640 --> 48:19.200
if you want to get the plate, the, the Google doc that Google sheet that Zach's put together,

48:19.200 --> 48:23.040
DM Zach, if you want to get the playbook, the hiring playbook that Zach's put together,

48:23.040 --> 48:28.800
DM Zach, go blow up Zach's DM. Uh, Zach's one of the only people that doesn't mind. You can go

48:28.800 --> 48:33.520
blow him up. He's, he's obviously he's got limited time, but he's kind enough. You guys message him.

48:33.520 --> 48:38.640
He'll send you those things and walk you through it. Um, any last thoughts you want to end with

48:38.640 --> 48:45.600
before we, we end this, uh, stream Zach. Yeah. One last thought is it doesn't really click for

48:45.600 --> 48:51.760
people. Sometimes this helps it click is you look at Amazon, Google, Microsoft,

48:52.640 --> 48:57.280
the difference between those companies and your company is they have thousands of people,

48:57.840 --> 49:02.560
tens of thousands of people pushing their company forward every day. That's why they're making so

49:02.560 --> 49:08.640
much money. They have thousands of sales reps, thousands of programmers, thousands of people

49:08.640 --> 49:12.080
pushing them forward, pushing forward. Of course they're going to win and make tons and tons of

49:12.080 --> 49:20.160
money. If you only have you pushing you forward, you're just living in the slow lane. Why not hire

49:20.160 --> 49:27.120
someone? And there's people can actually do specific things of your business way better than

49:27.120 --> 49:31.600
you. You think you're going to be a better website builder. You think you're going to be better at

49:31.600 --> 49:36.720
SEO. You think you're going to be better at sales. Even you're not, there's people better at that

49:36.720 --> 49:43.440
thing than you. You just got to find them and set them loose. And now you're going twice as fast,

49:43.440 --> 49:48.000
three times as fast. You have all these people, you become more like Amazon. So that's what needs

49:48.000 --> 49:55.360
to click. Why is Amazon, Google, Facebook, why are they such big companies? Tens, even hundreds

49:55.360 --> 50:00.080
of thousands of people are pushing them forward. Is it just you pushing you forward? Why don't you

50:00.080 --> 50:06.960
enroll someone and push yourself forward way faster? And at the same time, not just do it

50:06.960 --> 50:12.240
to make money and stretch yourself out, but build it right where now your life's awesome

50:12.240 --> 50:16.320
and you're doing things that light you up and make you a ton of money day after day. And it's a

50:16.320 --> 50:21.840
continuous upward spiral. That's the life that I want to live and I invite you guys to live too.

50:21.840 --> 50:27.600
So if you want help with it, just let me know. Happy to chat about it. Beautiful. Zach Powell,

50:27.600 --> 50:32.240
appreciate you, bro. Also, I know Zach does a bunch of stuff. Do you want to jump on?

50:32.240 --> 50:33.760
What's your website? Let me just drop it in here.

50:33.760 --> 50:35.760
ZachPowell.co.

50:35.760 --> 50:42.800
Z-A-C-K-W-E-P-O-W-E-L-L.CO.

50:44.240 --> 50:50.400
Yep. Yeah. I share like my Stripe page and like points of learning through my growth. It's like

50:50.400 --> 50:54.960
a seven minute video and then another video about what I'm doing. But yeah, check it out.

50:54.960 --> 50:58.720
Probably get some good insights. Zach Powell, thanks for jumping on, dude. I'm always a walk

50:58.720 --> 51:04.160
away, edified, excited, pumped. And I appreciate you being on and everyone else I know is as well.

51:04.160 --> 51:09.840
So we'll have you on again soon. And guys, message or DM Zach for those, the playbook,

51:09.840 --> 51:12.720
the sheet, and then if you want to check out his website as well. But anyway, thanks, bro.

51:14.480 --> 51:16.000
Thanks, Nick. That was fun, man.

51:16.000 --> 51:18.160
Hey, talk soon, bro. See you.
