Can you, can you not build a website? Can we just have the one pager? Can we have the ads running

00:05.200 --> 00:10.080
the one pager and we charge a thousand and we spend 500 and take the difference? Yes, we can.

00:10.640 --> 00:15.120
I've done it. I did it on accident and I've made money for a whole year, made whatever, six hundred

00:15.120 --> 00:19.360
dollars, six thousand dollars net because it was thousand five hundred made 500 bucks a month times

00:19.360 --> 00:26.640
twelve six thousand dollars net. Didn't even know. Yes, you can. However, I would highly, highly,

00:27.360 --> 00:34.080
highly encourage you that once you get the deal and you get enough deals that your bills are covered

00:34.080 --> 00:38.960
and you are like, OK, now it's time to go and build these properties that you take the profits

00:38.960 --> 00:46.080
and you actually go and build the properties. OK, because this is the part that makes the business

00:46.080 --> 00:52.720
model really sexy. OK, the business model is sexy even if you just do the arbitrage thousand bucks

00:52.720 --> 00:58.480
a month, 500 and ads take the difference, but it becomes really sexy if it's a thousand bucks

00:58.480 --> 01:05.440
a month that you're getting paid and you can turn the ads to 100 bucks a month or to 50 bucks a

01:05.440 --> 01:14.800
month or completely off and you can make 90 plus percent profit margin. And OK, it also this is

01:14.800 --> 01:20.480
another thing that's so dope about SEO is it mitigates your risk, right? If we're only relying

01:20.480 --> 01:25.680
on ads and all of our leads are coming on ads, coming from ads, and then something changes with

01:25.680 --> 01:32.720
ads, we're screwed. Right. So what I recommend is if Google has a way to get leads, let's try to tap

01:32.720 --> 01:38.320
into all. Let's try to get leads from ads. Let's get leads from GMB and let's get leads from the

01:38.320 --> 01:42.640
organic. We need to be we need to get. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We need to be

01:42.640 --> 01:48.160
getting all of this special delivery. Thank you. Of the monster told my wife to bring this thing

01:48.160 --> 01:53.440
up because you just never know when I'm going to need that. Thank you. So we want to mitigate

01:53.440 --> 01:57.680
our risk. We want to have leads coming in from ads. We have leads coming in from GMB and from organic.
