1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,720
Okay, Eric says, I just asked this question in the group, but looking for input as well,

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,640
what do you tell a potential BO to say to the customer that just called our Legion site,

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,280
then called the BO's website and got the same person for both companies?

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,720
I have an easy answer. What do you say, Kyle? Somebody calls the Legion site,

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,280
then they're shopping for the second one, they get the same person on the phone.

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,560
I just tell them that's a marketing site we have. She's like, oh yeah, we have a handful

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,160
of marketing sites that all generate leads that funnel back to us.

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,320
Here, I'll give you mine. Kyle, pretend that you're that person.

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,600
Yeah, pretend you call me out on it.

10
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,720
Yes. Yeah, this is Joe, Joe's Concrete.

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,000
Yeah, I just talked to you from another site.

12
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,960
Okay, yeah, that must be a sign. I mean, obviously, no, I would literally say something

13
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,360
smartass like that. Like, yeah, no, obviously, we're the best company in town. That's why we're

14
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,920
everywhere. But that's just one of our marketing sites. We have a couple of different sites.

15
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,600
Just depends on what you search. How can I help? You ready to get that estimate done?

16
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,400
Let's get this scheduled.

17
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,560
Tuesday still work for you, bro.

18
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,240
You want me to bring the frickin concrete when I come or you want me to wait? Okay.

19
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,640
It's not a big deal. So to answer your question, Eric, this goes for any objection.

20
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,640
That's not even an objection. If it's not a big deal to you, it's not a big deal to them.
