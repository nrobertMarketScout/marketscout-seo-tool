In one of your videos I watched recently, I believe you mentioned building out the website after they sign a six-month deal.
So do you also build out the site if they sign a three-month contract as well, or do you wait until so?
That's a good question, Bruce.
I always build the site as soon as they sign the contract.
Even if it's a three-month deal, I build it out unless it's a new niche, unless it's a niche that I've never done before.
If it's like an excavation niche where I've never done it, I'm not building that site out until I've gone through one client.
They've gone through the three or six months, they re-sign, then I'm going to build it out.
But I don't know if that niche is going to hit, but if it's like a concrete niche or something like that, yeah, even a three month, I'm building that shit.
I'm going to use the business owner's money to build it, and I'm going to build it right.
