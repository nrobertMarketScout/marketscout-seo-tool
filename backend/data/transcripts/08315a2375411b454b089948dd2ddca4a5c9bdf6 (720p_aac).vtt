How often are you calling BO's after closing them to make sure they're happy?

00:03.040 --> 00:05.120
I've just got an email saying, can we chat about a few things?

00:05.120 --> 00:07.120
Hopefully he's not going to cancel out there two months.

00:07.840 --> 00:13.040
Oh, don't you guys love when you get those emails, those convert, those text messages?

00:13.040 --> 00:14.320
Sometimes it's from your clients.

00:14.320 --> 00:18.240
Sometimes it's from your wife or your spouse or your significant other.

00:18.240 --> 00:20.800
Or I remember being a kid and my dad would be like, we got to go.

00:21.840 --> 00:25.200
We got to go check out my, if Porter is on here or Zach,

00:25.200 --> 00:26.800
we got to go check on the pumps.

00:26.800 --> 00:28.400
We got to go check all the font.

00:28.400 --> 00:31.440
Like, dude, I'm driving around with dad, getting a lecture is the worst.

00:31.440 --> 00:32.240
I know the stress.

00:34.240 --> 00:40.000
Typically what we like to do is reminder Mike is during that first contract,

00:40.000 --> 00:43.040
whether it's three months, whether it's six months, whether it's a year,

00:43.040 --> 00:46.160
if you, if you go big boy and you do a big girl, big boy,

00:46.160 --> 00:51.360
and you do a year right at the gate, that is the most important period.

00:51.360 --> 00:55.520
Because if you can get them through that first contract into the second contract,

00:55.520 --> 00:58.000
you're going to see your attrition go way down

00:58.000 --> 01:00.160
and your attention go way up, which is the same thing.

01:01.280 --> 01:05.200
So what we like to do is now it's a little bit different

01:05.200 --> 01:07.120
because I have Francesca that can assist me with this,

01:07.120 --> 01:11.200
but we like to check in weekly with these business owners

01:12.320 --> 01:14.880
at least once a week for the first contract.

01:14.880 --> 01:18.720
Now, typically what that looks like is maybe an email twice a month,

01:18.720 --> 01:21.680
maybe a text message once a month, and maybe a phone call once a month.

01:21.680 --> 01:24.480
Sometimes if they're a little bit like, you know, maybe with this one,

01:24.480 --> 01:28.160
maybe it's a phone call three times a month and it's an email once.

01:28.160 --> 01:30.640
And then the next week, it's like two calls and two emails.

01:30.640 --> 01:33.760
And then the same the next, and it's like, okay, now they're happy.

01:33.760 --> 01:37.120
We can kind of scale back, but I would be checking in at least once a week

01:37.120 --> 01:40.400
until you get to contract number two, which is that year,

01:40.400 --> 01:42.480
because then your attrition goes way down.

01:42.480 --> 01:42.880
Okay.
