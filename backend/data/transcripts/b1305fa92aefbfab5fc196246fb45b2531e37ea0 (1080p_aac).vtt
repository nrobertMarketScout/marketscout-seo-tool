How do we determine how a campaign is doing or why is it not doing well?

00:04.240 --> 00:09.600
So on the screen here I brought up this is a this is a good one to look at because this is one where

00:09.600 --> 00:15.920
Nick has a good website that's ranking well and SEO wise it's bringing in enough leads so we've

00:15.920 --> 00:19.840
we've kind of supplemented with a little bit of ad spend during the colder months

00:20.640 --> 00:25.040
and so I want to show you what the numbers that we're seeing here so you can kind of get an idea

00:25.040 --> 00:30.800
of what to look at so your your the answer to the question is going to be in the data

00:30.800 --> 00:34.640
so in the data here what I like to do is I like to pull up where my keywords are

00:35.520 --> 00:42.880
you can also pull this up in in the ads and the assets I like to look at what keywords are landing

00:42.880 --> 00:48.400
where they're landing and you can see here you know this this ad itself has had three total

00:48.400 --> 00:52.400
conversions it's had a little bit more than that but we're going to we're going to look at those

00:52.400 --> 00:57.120
ones that got they got tagged what they're getting tagged for we're looking at the total

00:57.120 --> 01:01.600
impressions here the big thing I'm looking for here is that am I getting impressions

01:01.600 --> 01:08.880
and am I getting a CTR which is the click through rate so in general about five you know four to

01:08.880 --> 01:16.320
four to six percent is considered decent and and you're doing a good job above that is is a really

01:16.320 --> 01:22.960
good job there's people that make millions of dollars a year selling at two to three percent

01:22.960 --> 01:30.080
CTR okay so a lot of it is just about volume but for us for our purposes if you're hitting in the

01:30.080 --> 01:35.360
above six percent on the CTR you're probably doing something good the other the other way to

01:35.360 --> 01:40.240
look at this too is another way to look at it is this search impression rate and if you go to

01:40.240 --> 01:45.680
columns if you don't have that on yours you can go to modify columns here you go to the competitive

01:45.680 --> 01:50.880
metrics right here and you'll see that top left search impression share and then you click apply

01:52.080 --> 01:58.560
and that brings that column up for you and so if this search if this search impression share is

01:59.120 --> 02:04.880
in the higher range or above 50 you're doing really really well and what you can do is you

02:04.880 --> 02:10.880
can use that data if I'm not getting the impressions that I want then I need to look at my my daily

02:10.880 --> 02:17.760
budget and what I'm bidding cpc wise and that's the first place to look the second place to look

02:17.760 --> 02:25.280
is where my CTR is my CTR is in the four percent range then I need to understand why typically

02:25.280 --> 02:31.040
that's going to be a budget issue and or possibly an ad copy issue but if your budget looks good and

02:31.040 --> 02:36.080
the cpc looks good if you go back and look at google google keyword planner and and that is

02:36.080 --> 02:40.960
where it needs to be then I would look at my ad copy next and then after that we look at

02:41.520 --> 02:47.040
search impression share and that tells us how we're doing to our competitors and then we have

02:47.040 --> 02:51.440
the conversion rate after that the conversion rate I'm not too worried about because most of

02:51.440 --> 02:55.360
you are not setting up the conversion tag so it's something you don't really need to worry about

02:55.360 --> 03:02.640
right now but that those are the things that I look at if my impressions are good I have good CTR

03:03.600 --> 03:08.880
I'm doing favorable with the search impression share now I start looking at my landing page

03:08.880 --> 03:13.200
only then do I start looking at my landing page after I've checked my ad copy is my ad

03:13.200 --> 03:18.080
copyright is my ad copy landing for the search terms that I want for the services I'm providing

03:19.360 --> 03:22.800
and you know there's everything working does the number work on it and all those things

03:22.800 --> 03:26.480
and then you want now you want to go start addressing your landing page issue
