1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,440
Okay, if I'm still good, and by the way, Aaron, I know Aaron isn't going to be able to be

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,840
on to the very, very end.

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:16,720
So at about the three quarter mark, so I'd say, let's see, in about 45 minutes, Aaron's

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,920
going to do a screenshot and anyone that's on this, just as a reminder, anybody that's

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:27,040
on this, this live stream till the end, we're automatically going to send you the digital

6
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,920
resource that we're going to create from this thing.

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,320
So you guys don't have to worry so much about taking notes.

8
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,360
I want you to just sit there.

9
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,880
I want you to take notes of the things that come to your mind, not the things that I'm

10
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:38,880
saying.

11
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,960
Because the things that I'm saying, we're going to send you guys in a digital resource.

12
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,800
I want you to take notes on the things that come to your mind, the ideas that are generated

13
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,760
from the things that I'm saying.

14
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,480
I think those are the most important things.

15
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,480
Excuse me.

16
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,560
And then Aaron's going to send you a digital resource that we create.

17
00:00:54,560 --> 00:01:00,400
So that said, guys, yeah, appreciate you guys being on.

18
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,480
We're going to keep doing these.

19
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:07,980
I like doing these sessions much better because the people that are on these are serious.

20
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:09,600
They're trying to actually make moves.

21
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,960
They're actually trying to do something with the information.

22
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,160
And it's not just a consumption fest like it sometimes turns into in the free group.

23
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:19,240
So I, again, I don't care if there's three people on this call.

24
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:23,680
It looks like we have about 14 people on this call, which is great.

25
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:28,160
Ironically, that's about the same or more than we were getting, even when we were going

26
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,560
live inside of Facebook.

27
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,240
So anyway, welcome to the call.

28
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,240
Appreciate you guys being on here.

29
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,060
And I'm going to make this worth your time.

30
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:38,040
This isn't something that I'm just going to pull out of my head, even though I could,

31
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,040
because I've done this.

32
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,040
I've talked about this a million times.

33
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,520
But I took, you know, I think it took me about 45 minutes.

34
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,560
I got all my thoughts on the paper, put them in order, exactly the things I want to cover

35
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,760
and I'm going to go over that right now.

36
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,640
So, guys, today we're going to be talking about niches and seasonality.

37
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:59,040
And if you haven't noticed already, I'm really harping on the, you know, the niche and city

38
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,520
selection first.

39
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,040
And the reason why there's a million things we could talk about, we could talk about sales

40
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,080
and there's a trillion things inside of sales.

41
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:14,400
We could talk about, you know, hooking business on which is part of sales, we could talk about

42
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,680
building lists, we could talk about what else could, I mean, there's

43
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,160
so many different things we could talk about, you know, doing the actual technical stuff

44
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,600
on your agency, setting up the business, what type of business.

45
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,360
There's really, really unlimited topics for me to talk about.

46
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:38,560
But again, as I've repeated the last couple of weeks is if you don't nail this part correctly,

47
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,920
everything becomes tough.

48
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,920
Everything becomes very difficult.

49
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:46,440
And so I've commonly said inside of, inside of digital landlords, inside of the free group

50
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:50,840
is the money is made in the buy, not the sell.

51
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,920
Meaning if you don't pick the niche and city correctly, it doesn't matter how good you

52
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,920
are at sales.

53
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,560
It doesn't matter how good you are at SEO.

54
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,560
Everything becomes more difficult.

55
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,000
Your ads are more expensive.

56
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,360
It's harder to rank.

57
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,440
It's harder to find the right business owner if you can even find one at all.

58
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,600
And on the flip side, if you've picked the right niche, you picked the right city, you

59
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,640
nail that.

60
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,640
Everything else becomes easy and easier.

61
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,640
I've had deals.

62
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:20,200
I specifically remember one, I didn't do so many due diligence worksheets, but I just

63
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:26,320
stumbled across a very, very, you know, I would say low hanging fruit is the term I

64
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,200
like to use something that, you know, there's high search volume.

65
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,560
It's a perfect niche.

66
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,960
It's also got a lot of, you know, it had, you know, very low competition.

67
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:40,960
I put up a website and it wasn't even something I was like, I didn't really have the bandwidth

68
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:46,760
to even build a website at that time, meaning I was so busy with other projects and pre-selling

69
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,080
and doing and trying to scale the specific niches.

70
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,640
But I just saw this, this opportunity and it was so good.

71
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,480
I was like, I'm a fool if I don't do this.

72
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:00,080
So I literally just went on, I bought the domain, I passed it over to my team, which

73
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,080
at the time consisted of like one person that I have hired in Africa, his name is Peter

74
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,080
and then Francesca.

75
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,240
And I said, Hey, can you just build this out?

76
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:14,440
Just get me like a thousand words on the homepage, 250 to 500 on the service pages, you know,

77
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,440
just the bare minimum.

78
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,800
Give me a tracking number and just like, I don't even want backlinks.

79
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,440
I don't want to worry about SEO, nothing.

80
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,800
I don't care about GMB, just get this thing live.

81
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,440
And I did this and I actually forgot about it.

82
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:35,240
I forgot about it for like six weeks and I was checking in with another client who I

83
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,360
had in mind when I built this because they had my site in the city next door within the

84
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,780
same niche.

85
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,760
And I went and reached, I just did like some basic stuff.

86
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:49,040
I cleared my search history and lo and behold, within six weeks, I was completely not just

87
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,720
on page one, but I was top two or three for every single search term.

88
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,680
And these are like the main key search terms in the city.

89
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,080
And I didn't do anything and I didn't even build the website completely how I like to

90
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,080
build it.

91
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,080
I usually like to do 2000 words on the homepage.

92
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,960
I like to do 500 to 1000 on the service pages.

93
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:11,720
H1 is done properly, H2 is done properly, the page titles, all that stuff.

94
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:16,800
We didn't really do it that great of a job, but because it was such a good opportunity,

95
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,600
I did nothing, just built the project, let it sit there, let it sizzle, let it simmer.

96
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,600
And I came back and in six weeks that thing was completely glued to the top.

97
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:31,680
So that is why I am such a big proponent and why I'm going to continually talk about the

98
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,840
city and niche combination, the due diligence.

99
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,360
And I know this is like the third week in a row that we've been talking about it with,

100
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:43,520
especially with this new format going into like really deep, nuanced stuff.

101
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,520
But this is important.

102
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,840
And like the topic today is we're going to talk about niches and seasonality.

103
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:53,920
And it may sound like something that you could cover in one sentence and I probably could.

104
00:05:53,920 --> 00:06:00,360
However, at the same time, guys, I've lost thousands of dollars by not doing certain

105
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,360
things.

106
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,040
By the way, Aaron, there's somebody in the waiting room.

107
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,040
I don't know if you saw that.

108
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,960
And let me know if that'll let you admit them.

109
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,120
And also, Aaron, until we get to about the halfway mark, you can continue admitting people

110
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,120
after that.

111
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,440
Then don't make sure they're muted as well.

112
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,880
So today, guys, we're going to be talking about seasonality and niches.

113
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,800
For those of you that weren't on last week, for those of you that are maybe brand new

114
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:26,920
to the group, just a two second or maybe, I guess, 30 second brief on me is, you know,

115
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,120
obviously, my name is Nick.

116
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:32,160
I started the free group art of pre-selling or sorry, it was the art of pre-selling the

117
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,240
art of digital real estate.

118
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,880
I also started and run the group called Digital Landlords.

119
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:43,360
It's my paid community that I created from my experience in building and scaling a rank

120
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,360
and rent agency.

121
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:50,240
I've been doing this since 2016 with a tiny little, you know, shiny object, whatever in

122
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,280
there where I was gone for about nine months.

123
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,560
For the better part of eight years, I've been doing this.

124
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,640
I have lost millions, and I say millions, it's not just an arbitrary number, actually

125
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:07,280
multiple millions of dollars I have lost on building niches in the wrong cities, in the

126
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:13,160
wrong states, in the wrong building websites, sorry, in the wrong niches and cities, in

127
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,160
the wrong states.

128
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,400
I have lost money hiring the wrong people.

129
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,160
I've lost so much money on Google Ads.

130
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,840
And I've also made millions of dollars.

131
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:26,520
And over the last, since 2020, we have been doing at least seven figures and we're never

132
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,520
going to go back.

133
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,400
OK, so 2020, we finally figured out the missing pieces to this business model.

134
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,600
Many of you guys have probably heard of this business model, maybe in the past.

135
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,560
Build a website, rank it, go rent it out.

136
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,560
That's great.

137
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,560
There's missing pieces to it.

138
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,840
The due diligence process has to be perfect.

139
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,720
You have to consider the CPC.

140
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,920
You also need to realize if you want to scale this thing, you need to sell your website

141
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:50,680
first, get a client first, and then build a website on the back end, unless you have

142
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:54,400
unlimited time and unlimited money, you need to pre-sell and you need to flip this thing.

143
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,760
So I figured out all these missing pieces in 2020.

144
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:01,920
And in eight months, we went from eight to ten thousand dollars a month, with half of

145
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:05,160
that being SEO, to a hundred thousand dollars per month.

146
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:09,360
Eight months later, in July of 2020, a hundred percent lead generation, SEO was completely

147
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,360
separate.

148
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,000
I'd given that away and was taking a cut on it.

149
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
That was 2020.

150
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,960
In 2021, we did one point four or five million.

151
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,360
December 1st, 2021, after having so many different people hit me up with questions, hey, how

152
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,360
are you getting deals?

153
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,360
How are you selling?

154
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,360
How would blah, blah, blah.

155
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,360
I realized I needed to launch something and teach people how to do this the way that I

156
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,360
did.

157
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,200
The way that I did it that allowed me to scale.

158
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:36,800
So that said, that's kind of, I guess, would be what if you're sitting here going, why

159
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,800
the heck should I listen to this guy?

160
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,800
That's what I'm going to give you.

161
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,520
And at the same time, I want you to take everything that I'm giving you.

162
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,680
And I don't just want you to accept it.

163
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,680
I want you to think about it.

164
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,160
I want you to be intuitive about it.

165
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,480
And I want you to test it.

166
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,160
I don't want you to accept what I'm saying.

167
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,680
But I will tell you, I've been in this game a long time and I know what I'm talking about.

168
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,040
And if I don't, I don't say it.

169
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,320
So anything that I say is what I've done.

170
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:06,400
So that's a little bit of why I think it's worth your time to stay on this call, as well

171
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,360
as the fact for those of you that just joined at the end of this call, if you are still

172
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,160
on, we are going to send you a digital resource with notes.

173
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,200
Basically, it's going to look nice.

174
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,200
It's going to be a PDF.

175
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,720
You're going to be able to just, you know, quickly have all of the stuff that we cover

176
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,400
PDF.

177
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,960
And so that's kind of the deal.

178
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,000
So what the game plan is.

179
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,000
Hold on. Let's make sure we're muted here.

180
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,840
Yeah, so I just muted them.

181
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,920
No problem. Is there a setting you can just keep everyone auto muted when they join?

182
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,560
We'll check it out.

183
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,840
I'm trying to find it, but I'll just search it.

184
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,160
It's completely fine. And by the way, I do get it.

185
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,920
By the way, I've had this happen to me before.

186
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,360
So if that was you, it doesn't matter.

187
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,160
I just want to make sure that we can all get through this quick.

188
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:50,000
So here's kind of the outline of what I want to or I guess my promise to you on this

189
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,800
call is my goal for today's training over the next thirty nine.

190
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,520
Let's see, what is going to be forty five?

191
00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:02,080
Yeah, forty four minutes is I want you guys to realize that things change

192
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,160
in this business as the seasons change.

193
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,360
OK, and there are certain things that you must do in order to protect yourself

194
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,840
against these changes.

195
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,760
And as well, I'm going to give you guys some tips for avoiding any issues

196
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,560
whatsoever that would normally arise as a result of the changing seasons.

197
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,400
Now, some of you guys are sitting here going, man, it's it's July, almost August.

198
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:26,080
We're still a couple of months away from, you know, winter, at least in the US.

199
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,360
And and by the way, if you're not in the US, then the same principles apply.

200
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,920
But your summer might be different than my summer.

201
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,200
Like I know in Australia, the summer I think is flipped.

202
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,640
Summer is during my winter in the US.

203
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,600
So just take the principles.

204
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,760
Don't necessarily, you know, go well on my summers at a different time.

205
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,200
Just take the principles that I'm teaching and then apply it to your situation.

206
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,200
I'm talking about it right now because this is something

207
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,720
that needs to be on your mind right now.

208
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,520
And it's going to affect the way you sell.

209
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,080
It's going to affect the niches that you go after, the cities that you go after,

210
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,680
the way that you do the deal, you structure the deal,

211
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,920
the things that you say to the business owner.

212
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:04,680
I know this sounds very nuanced and I don't want you guys to get overwhelmed.

213
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,440
But you need to understand that this is something I didn't know.

214
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,560
And two years in a row, it almost put me out of business

215
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:15,280
because I didn't understand this principle, OK,

216
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:19,400
which is that that niches have seasonality and it does matter.

217
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,840
OK, so the game plan for today's call is we're going to go as follows.

218
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:28,520
We're going to cover how the seasons affect this business.

219
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:32,400
What what you need to think about before selecting your niche,

220
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,000
which is going to be brief, because I've talked already about niches.

221
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,560
We're going to talk about what to consider when selecting a city slash state.

222
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,040
And then if you're not in a city slash state in the US, in your country,

223
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,880
whatever city is in the country you're targeting, which, by the way,

224
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,160
this does work in other countries, for those of you that are wondering about that question.

225
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:52,160
We're going to talk about how to preemptively solve any problems

226
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,600
with the business owner that would normally come as a result of seasonality.

227
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
And then we're going to talk about how to make sure your contracts match the seasons.

228
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,320
OK, and then if we have time, we're going to do some Q&A.

229
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,680
So that said, guys, let's one more time, if you stay to the end,

230
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,000
we're going to get you that digital resource because we appreciate you

231
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,520
giving your time and I want you taking notes on the things that come to your mind.

232
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,920
Not what I'm covering, because I'm going to give you the notes

233
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,560
on what we're covering in the form of that digital resource if you stay to the end.

234
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,040
OK, so let's talk first about

235
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,440
how the seasons actually affect this business.

236
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:30,440
This is a fact. OK, lead flow changes with the seasons.

237
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,240
No matter what anyone tells you, no matter how much you want to pretend it doesn't.

238
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,800
Leads are different in the spring than they are the week of Christmas.

239
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,440
That's just a fact, right?

240
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,240
Because of a million different reasons we're going to talk about today.

241
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,680
But just so you know, leads are going to change.

242
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,520
The flow of leads, the amount of leads that come in in specific niches

243
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,160
does change with the seasons. OK, just so everybody knows.

244
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,960
Another fact, OK, most home service

245
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:04,840
businesses slow down during the holidays and during the winter,

246
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,960
which is basically when it gets cold.

247
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,480
Let me repeat that most home service businesses

248
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,320
slow down during the holidays and when it gets cold.

249
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,800
Now, obviously, there's going to be stuff in there that might be,

250
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,920
you know, a little bit flipped, for example,

251
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:23,600
when it goes from getting being really hot and your AC goes on to,

252
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,920
you know, it starts to get cold and you kick on your heater.

253
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,200
It starts to stink and smell.

254
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,040
And then all of a sudden, oh, my gosh, I need to come and check my whatever my my

255
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,560
what the heck is it called my not my thermostat, my unit

256
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,440
that, you know, that little period of change is going to get going to give a spike.

257
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,760
But just what you guys need to understand, the majority of the niches

258
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:50,160
that we talk about that we target that I've made my money on the concretes,

259
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,320
the tree service, the fencing, the the the epoxy.

260
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,280
All of these things are negatively affected during Christmas

261
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,920
and the cold when it gets cold.

262
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,680
OK, again, if you're if it gets cold at a different time of the year than December,

263
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,960
then you need to consider the fact that that might affect you twice,

264
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:12,200
because no matter what, when it's holidays, people typically

265
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,840
aren't doing stuff on their house.

266
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,080
OK, that's just that's just really the case.

267
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:20,000
OK, when the seasons change and I'm talking about, you know,

268
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,440
when things start to get cold, when the holidays start to come up,

269
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,160
you know, probably from Halloween.

270
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:29,200
I know that's not really a holiday, but from October 31st until.

271
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,320
Honestly, until after the New Year,

272
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,480
definitely through January and then about mid February.

273
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:42,400
People's desire to fix their houses is pretty much like going down,

274
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:49,000
and it is the slowest from December 15th to December 31st.

275
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:54,440
That is a fact, and I can prove that I could show you so many examples.

276
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:59,200
People's desire to fix their homes, to do repairs,

277
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,880
to add concrete to whatever on their houses,

278
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,000
unless it's a complete emergency, like their tree is falling into their house.

279
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,920
It is going to be the slowest from December 15th to December 31st.

280
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:14,200
OK, and then for some weird reason at the first of the year,

281
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:18,640
even though it's still bloody cold, people like have some,

282
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,400
not all, but a lot of people, they have kind of like this like new,

283
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,880
hey, we're going to get things tightened up and we're going to do this.

284
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,120
That typically comes more during spring cleaning.

285
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,280
But you will see a little bit of an increase during the first of the year.

286
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,880
But I'm telling you, those last two weeks in December

287
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,240
are the slowest time of the year. OK.

288
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,560
I don't know other than the fact that when it's cold,

289
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,320
I don't think people are in the mood. They're not thinking about it.

290
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:42,240
But I also know that people are like they're out doing parties.

291
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,480
They're having parties at their house.

292
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,640
They're they're buying gifts for their kids.

293
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,200
They're traveling for for the holidays.

294
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,360
Money's not as expendable. Right.

295
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,360
And that's just a fact. OK.

296
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,960
Also note that like when the season starts to change from the cold

297
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:03,360
back to the warm, the spring, the spring cleaning itch, people,

298
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,680
there's a there's an uptick.

299
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,440
There's a really nice uptick in Leeds.

300
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,640
And hey, let's come in, you know, get our trees trimmed

301
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,960
and get that taken care of. Let's throw in that fence.

302
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,600
Let's get that artificial grass put in that we were talking about last fall.

303
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,240
We don't want to put it in during the winter.

304
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:18,960
Let's put it in.

305
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,320
We're not even able to use it during the winter.

306
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,240
Let's put it in now that the snow's starting to melt.

307
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,480
Or if it doesn't snow now that it's starting to get warm, we can go out by the pool.

308
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,560
Let's throw in that fire pit.

309
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,920
Let's do that outdoor kitchen or whatever the case is.

310
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,400
As the season starts to change to warmer weather

311
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:37,680
based on the niches that we target and talk about basic home service niches,

312
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,800
you are going to see an uptick. OK.

313
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,680
And one of the things I want to add just as something to remember

314
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:47,280
is there is a strong correlation.

315
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:52,080
And I know this because I've I've heard people say it is when tax returns

316
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:56,520
start to come back to people, you start to see an uptick as well.

317
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,960
OK, people get their check, especially like obviously W-2.

318
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,960
They go if you're on a W-2, you go and you submit your taxes

319
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,080
and then you get your return, whatever.

320
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:08,720
A lot of people take that money and they put it into fixing up their house.

321
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:12,200
You know, pressure washing the the the entire house.

322
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:16,880
Epoxying the garage, whatever the case is.

323
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,400
And these are things that I have not just heard is or not.

324
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,640
This isn't data points.

325
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,080
This is from experience.

326
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,040
I have seen it, guys, my first two years in business.

327
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,160
OK, like actual because I did it the first year.

328
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,000
I got sidetracked, whatever.

329
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,320
So 2017, I would say my first three.

330
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,520
Let me not even lie to you guys.

331
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:40,400
My first three years, 17, I basically only had SEO clients

332
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,080
because I was trying to like just make money to pay the bills.

333
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,600
OK, because I was coming off the back end of a failed business.

334
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,800
17, I was doing SEO because I just need to pay the bills.

335
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:54,520
18 and 19, I got wrecked during the holidays.

336
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,840
I got absolutely wrecked.

337
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,000
And what happened to me is in 2018,

338
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,600
the biggest time I got wrecked was in 19

339
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,200
because 18 something happened that kind of like confused me.

340
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,320
And I thought that, you know, I was safe.

341
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,920
But the mistake that I made, guys, is and this is another reason

342
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,440
I could sit here and talk about this all day long.

343
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:15,400
But another one of the 50 reasons

344
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,040
why you should be doing flat fee regeneration and not paper

345
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:23,880
lead or commission deals or, you know, profit splitting is for me.

346
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,680
What ended up happening is a lot of my deals were on paper

347
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,600
lead back in 2018, 2019.

348
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,280
I thought that was the holy grail of of how to structure this business.

349
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:36,080
OK, and what ended up happening is I had like some pretty solid months,

350
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,400
July, August, September, even October.

351
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,720
And in 2018, November, go figure,

352
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,520
was, I think, my biggest month of the year.

353
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,520
And what had happened is I was in a specific industry

354
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,200
that, you know, was affected by weather.

355
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,400
And the industry was basement waterproofing.

356
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,120
OK, and what happened is in October, I believe it was maybe September.

357
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:03,520
I happen to have sites in states that got hit by hurricanes.

358
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,360
Yeah, I think it's called hurricanes or typhoons.

359
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,040
I think it's hurricanes anyway. Yeah.

360
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:12,480
So what happened is September, October, these storms came in,

361
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,000
completely wiped out houses and flooded basements and all this stuff.

362
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:22,040
And so it took a while for the insurance people to come out

363
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,680
and, you know, quote them whatever to clean up.

364
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,080
And November was phenomenal for me.

365
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,520
I mean, we had so many leads.

366
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,240
And at the time, I was getting paid per lead.

367
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,080
So I thought I'd figured out the game.

368
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,680
Huge November.

369
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:38,880
I'm trying to make my projections based on like October was good.

370
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,640
September was good. October was better.

371
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,080
November is amazing.

372
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,160
And I'm like, dude, this is it's just going to get better.

373
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:50,280
And then December 2018, we literally just completely craft the bet.

374
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,120
I mean, our revenue went to like 25 percent

375
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,040
because all of our deals, for the most part, were on paper lead.

376
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,760
So if no leads come in, no revenue comes in.

377
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,000
Imagine, right, like all of my employees I've got.

378
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,520
I've got an office space.

379
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,280
I've got, you know, vacation I've budgeted for.

380
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,400
I got Christmas coming up.

381
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,440
I've got all these different things I want to do.

382
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,200
And I'm on a paper lead model.

383
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,880
And all the leads that were good during November.

384
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,400
Now people are pausing because it's the holidays.

385
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,280
OK, even though they need to fix it, they're going to wait until the spring.

386
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,360
And guys, I got absolutely wrecked that that December, like absolutely wrecked.

387
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,840
I remember I was like nervous, like this is not good.

388
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,240
I was worried about my business.

389
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,760
I was worried about having to let people go.

390
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:35,200
I was worried about the fact that I had a lease on a rent payment on an office.

391
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,720
I was worried about buying.

392
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,880
I mean, everything was terrible.

393
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,520
It was just so terrible because I couldn't really control it.

394
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:48,360
OK, and because I'm an idiot, the next year, 2019, I all of 2019,

395
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,000
I continue to do paper lead for the most part.

396
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,680
Hey, it's just I was like, yeah, it's just because the niche, right?

397
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,760
It's just because I was in basement, waterproof and I need to go.

398
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,840
So I did paper lead, but I did it in different niches.

399
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:02,080
Started expanding into foundation repair and a few different things.

400
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,680
Lo and behold, same exact thing happened to me in 2019.

401
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:11,480
And this time it happened to me starting from end of October, November and December.

402
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:15,280
So I had like a two and a half month just tank and it was bad.

403
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,640
And if you guys remember my story, which I shared a little bit of at the beginning,

404
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,800
2019, December was kind of my like, all right,

405
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,360
draw a line in the sand or get out of this business, figure out,

406
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,600
are you going to go all in on this or are you not going to go all in on this?

407
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,720
But here's here's your moment.

408
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,040
And so I want to go like the reason I'm harping on this today, guys,

409
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:39,120
is because I have literally had some really depressing

410
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,600
November, December's and enough that it

411
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,920
it really, really made me like question this business model.

412
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:50,120
And it wasn't because of the business model is because I was an idiot

413
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,480
and I was structuring it incorrectly.

414
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,440
So if you haven't heard any of my content or me talk about paper lead,

415
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:59,480
go to YouTube, type in paper lead, Nick Wood, paper

416
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:02,320
lead, digital real estate, whatever you're going to see my videos.

417
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,240
I am not a fan of paper lead for those reasons. OK.

418
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:11,120
So just so you guys know, there is seasonality to this business.

419
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:15,640
You are going to continue to get leads throughout the year to some degree.

420
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:20,640
Now, if you're in snow removal, probably going to get zero leads in July,

421
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,640
except for maybe somebody looking for a job.

422
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,800
But if you're in like just a regular service, tree service,

423
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:30,240
concrete, spray foam insulation, artificial grass, fencing, masonry,

424
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,720
you're going to get some leads during the slow time,

425
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,800
but it's going to be drastically different. OK.

426
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,240
So that is what I want to talk about in terms of like, just so you know,

427
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,400
you need to be aware, you can pretend it's not the case.

428
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,880
But the seasons do affect this business.

429
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,640
They do affect this business.

430
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,920
But I have a solution for you.

431
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,800
I'm going to get you there in just a second. OK.

432
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:53,600
You also want to talk about next is you guys need to consider this

433
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,600
when you're selecting your niche. OK.

434
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:00,360
So what I would recommend is just everything is going to be seasonal

435
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,080
to some degree, no matter what.

436
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,160
Everything is going to be some degree of seasonality.

437
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,960
You know, concrete is going to be slower in December.

438
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,000
That's just a fact.

439
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,920
Concrete is going to be slower in November than it is in in in, you know, April.

440
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,400
That's a fact.

441
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,720
You're not going to be able to completely avoid seasonality.

442
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:22,000
But what I would recommend is don't pick something that is the best

443
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,960
or is good just during the winter like snow removal,

444
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,280
like and by the way, I've done I didn't do snow removal

445
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,960
because I was smart enough that snow removal didn't make sense to me.

446
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,320
But I thought, you know what, it'd be interesting.

447
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,720
I should do a website for Christmas lights.

448
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,120
You know, Christmas light installation.

449
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,640
And I did it.

450
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,840
I can't remember if I even landed a deal

451
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,040
or if I was just sending over so I did get leads.

452
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,960
Of course, I built a site, got it right, got some leads.

453
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,440
Might even have the website.

454
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,880
In fact, let me check.

455
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,880
Be hilarious if I do. Let me just go like this.

456
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,040
I think I've got I told them to get rid of it because.

457
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,720
It just didn't make sense.

458
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,040
Let me see if I have this website still.

459
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:10,160
Let's see. Hang tight, is that me?

460
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,360
Oh, I do have it, huh?

461
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,400
I do have it, and I am ranked.

462
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,320
Number two, hilarious.

463
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,960
I don't even know if we got any leads last year.

464
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,400
I'm sure we did, but we don't even have a client for it.

465
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,640
Like, it's just a website that's ranked.

466
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,200
So I said not to get rid of it, I'm sure.

467
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,120
Christmas lights is good in end of November.

468
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,800
If you're in Utah, by the way,

469
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,280
people start hanging Christmas lights

470
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:35,720
the second the Thanksgiving's over.

471
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:39,440
In fact, Thanksgiving weekend, end of November and December.

472
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,760
That's it. After that, it's done.

473
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,160
OK, now I know there's some permanent Christmas light

474
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,280
businesses popping up, whatever.

475
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,200
I think it looks tacky.

476
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,280
Maybe it's just the company that's in my neighborhood.

477
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,240
I don't like it.

478
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,800
But I'm telling you guys, if you do Christmas lights,

479
00:24:55,800 --> 00:25:00,000
if you do snow removal, it's going to be good for like two months, three months.

480
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,400
And then the rest of the year, there's no leads coming in.

481
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,200
So you can't expect that person.

482
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,000
It's going to be really tough to convince them, hey,

483
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,520
you're going to pay me this amount through the whole year,

484
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,400
but you're only going to get leads for two months.

485
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,920
That's really, really difficult.

486
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:16,880
So just my two cents.

487
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,120
I'm not interested in those niches.

488
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,800
I'm not interested in niches that are snow removal,

489
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,960
Christmas lights, stuff that only makes sense

490
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,600
during a very specific time of the year.

491
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,920
So the niche does matter.

492
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:33,000
Now, I'm not going to spend a ton of time because we've talked a lot about niches.

493
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,480
But just so you're aware, I'm not a fan of those niches

494
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,480
because there's not that much of a runway for you to get leads. OK.

495
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:43,520
OK, let's talk really quick about what to consider when selecting a city.

496
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,080
Just want to make, like I said before,

497
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,000
every city in the world is going to be affected to some degree

498
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,120
or another by seasonality.

499
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,240
You cannot avoid it.

500
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,960
But what I would just suggest really briefly on this topic

501
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,720
is try to avoid cities where it is extreme.

502
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:03,360
If there is extreme weather, I would avoid it because and it's not

503
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,200
that it's not going to work. It's not that you.

504
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,520
Oh, my gosh, I have a friend.

505
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,600
He's got some websites in that and he's doing.

506
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,240
That's great. It can work.

507
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:15,240
But it comes back to like, why make it harder on yourself if you don't have to?

508
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,160
If I can build for the same amount of money,

509
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:22,880
I can build a concrete website in Naples, Florida,

510
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,920
where the weather is moderate to good all year.

511
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,160
Concrete can be poured all year.

512
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:33,920
Or I could do it in Minneapolis, where it gets super cold.

513
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,600
Or, you know, Sioux Falls.

514
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,680
I think that's one of the Dakotas.

515
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,080
I think that just came out of my mouth.

516
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:45,080
Why on earth would I spend the same exact time

517
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,880
when I could get the say I could I could spend the same time

518
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,720
and have one that's going to be producing year round?

519
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:52,000
It just it doesn't make sense.

520
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,920
Now, if you live in Minneapolis,

521
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,280
then you might have an argument, hey, I have contacts here and that's whatever.

522
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,720
That's great. But if you're just living outside of these states,

523
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:07,440
do not try and target extreme freaking cities in the same way that I recommend.

524
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,600
I tell you guys, don't target California.

525
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,400
You can. But why?

526
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,240
Why are you making it harder on yourself?

527
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,480
Like, let's do the easiest thing we can do.

528
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,440
I'm lazy, guys. I'm going to be honest.

529
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,880
I want to do the most bare minimum thing I can do and make the most amount of money.

530
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,480
I'll put in the work.

531
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,680
But sometimes because we're willing to do the hard work,

532
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:31,520
we don't use our heads and we end up doing so much more work

533
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,480
than we need to do to get the same result. Right.

534
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,840
It's like I'm willing to go knock doors.

535
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,920
I did it for four years. I made good money.

536
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,360
I made a couple hundred grand a year.

537
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,680
I mean, from eighty thousand dollars my lowest year to two hundred and ten

538
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:46,680
thousand dollars in a four month, five month summer knocking doors.

539
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:49,480
Yes, I'm willing to do the hard work.

540
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:53,440
But then one day I was like, why the heck am I not using the Internet?

541
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,560
Why the heck am I using my time and trading my time for dollars?

542
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,680
Why don't I put the same energy and effort?

543
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,960
It's going to be my same 40 hour, 60 hour, 100 hour week.

544
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,240
Why don't I put it into something where I can use the Internet?

545
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:10,200
And now I can go and get deals without having to knock on a door.

546
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,240
And that's when I got into this. And guess what?

547
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:16,480
I'm putting in actually less work than I was,

548
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:21,920
way less mental and physical labor than I was when I was doing door knocking.

549
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:25,320
And I'm making millions of dollars a year versus a couple hundred

550
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,360
thousand dollars a year.

551
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,920
That was guaranteed because I was good at it and knew what to do.

552
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,960
But this I had leverage.

553
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,600
And so my point being, guys, I've done it.

554
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,600
I've tried the Dakotas. I've tried the Minnesotas.

555
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,880
I've tried these extreme.

556
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,320
I've tried the New York.

557
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,120
I have a website in Rochester.

558
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,800
I don't know if it's still a website, by the way.

559
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,840
The reason I don't know why some of these are alive

560
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:50,000
is because Francesca runs my agency, most most of my agency.

561
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,760
We meet. She updates me.

562
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,960
She gives I give her feedback.

563
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,720
Here's what we should do. Here's where we should focus.

564
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,600
Here's the guy that wants leads.

565
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,560
But she runs it.

566
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,240
I don't even know if we still have this website,

567
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,960
but we got this deal one time in Rochester, New York.

568
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,400
And I think we just targeted the area like idiots

569
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,800
because I wasn't thinking about seasonality.

570
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,840
And I think it was was it concrete, I believe.

571
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,680
And I went did my process, built a one pager, ran ads, got leads.

572
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,720
Boom, boom, boom. Sold somebody.

573
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,760
OK, a thousand bucks a month at minimum.

574
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,640
And I remember this because I very rarely do deals under a thousand.

575
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:27,880
Got the deal. And lo and behold, as soon as it got cold,

576
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:33,840
dudes calling me up, hey, we're we're not doing any more work until like January.

577
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,760
And I was like, what do you mean?

578
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:38,120
He's like, no, we actually like don't we don't we just don't even do it.

579
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,000
We just shut it down from now.

580
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,920
And he's like from about like he was like, whatever.

581
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,720
I think it was October.

582
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:50,360
It's like from mid November or end of November till February 15th.

583
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:53,360
He's like, we don't offer the service like we're not.

584
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,720
There's no work that happens.

585
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,160
And I didn't even know this.

586
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,800
I was like, you're joking.

587
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,480
No, we don't do it.

588
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,280
And so I there's nothing I could do.

589
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:05,360
I just had to like say, all right, well, I guess we'll talk in in March.

590
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,480
Right. And I've already built the website.

591
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,400
I've already got the deal.

592
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,560
I've already put the money into it.

593
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:13,120
So I'm trying to get you guys to just not make these mistakes that I made.

594
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,960
OK, there we go.

595
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,960
OK, now this is the good stuff.

596
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,040
This is the meat and potatoes.

597
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:18,960
What I want to talk about today.

598
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,280
There is always going to be seasonality.

599
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,200
You're going to deal with it.

600
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,520
It's part of the business.

601
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,600
It's part of every business.

602
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,520
I don't care what it is.

603
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,000
Retail is the opposite.

604
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,480
Right. Retail is the opposite.

605
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,720
They love Christmas.

606
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,760
Right. They love November, Black Friday,

607
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,240
because that's when everyone's buying Christmas.

608
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,960
Right. For us, we don't like Christmas because it's slow,

609
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,560
which I actually do love Christmas because it's when I take the time

610
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,840
to to put my foot on the gas and slash travel

611
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,200
because it does get a little bit slower.

612
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,720
But guys, this is the part I want to talk about, which is how to

613
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:55,560
how to preemptively solve any potential issues with the business owner.

614
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:59,120
Issues that normally would come as a result of seasonality.

615
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,800
You and I'm going to say this first.

616
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,120
I promise you they're going to come.

617
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,280
These issues are going to arise.

618
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,000
I don't care how cool your business owner is.

619
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,720
I don't care how long you know each other.

620
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,400
You guys went to high school.

621
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,920
If your buddy's paying you a thousand bucks a month

622
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:16,040
and you send him zero leads in November and December, it ain't going to fly.

623
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,600
I don't care how. Again, I don't care if it's your brother.

624
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,560
That might be different.

625
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,800
Maybe your brother is allergic to money,

626
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,800
but there is going to be an issue. OK.

627
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,480
So you know there's going to be an issue.

628
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,040
You know it's going to be a thing.

629
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:32,960
So what I always say in terms of this, I cover this in depth

630
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,560
inside of Digital Landlords.

631
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,200
Anyone that's on this call, I know Lane is.

632
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,600
He's inside Digital Landlords.

633
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:42,440
I talk very much about, you know, a lot of people say eliminate objections.

634
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:45,120
OK. I'm sorry. A lot of people say overcome objections.

635
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,360
And I like to say eliminate objections.

636
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,880
Overcoming an objection means that there's an objection that's presented.

637
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,480
And now you need to overcome it.

638
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,520
And what I found is that when you do that, you are on the defense

639
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:58,240
and you waited until they've presented an objection.

640
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,680
And now you have to overcome it. They voiced it.

641
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:03,120
It's a thing. They made it a thing. Now you have to overcome it.

642
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:09,400
On the flip side, if you know it's going to come and you bring it up first

643
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:13,680
and we call this preemptive, preemptively overcoming objections,

644
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,760
we bring it up first.

645
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,760
It is so much easier. OK.

646
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,200
And think about for those of you guys that have kids

647
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,840
or those of you guys have nieces or nephews or siblings, whatever.

648
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:27,640
It's like, for example, if you sit down and you're at dinner

649
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:30,600
and you tell the kids, you're like, look, if you finish this meal,

650
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,640
if you finish 10 bites, right, because with kids, it's bites

651
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,640
because they don't finish anything that's healthy.

652
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,080
If you will have five bites of your chicken,

653
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,560
then you're going to be able to have ice cream.

654
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,160
OK. And you just lay it out up front.

655
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,960
As the food's getting put, you get five bites.

656
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,680
You can have ice cream. OK.

657
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,680
Now, they still might throw a fit. It still might be a thing.

658
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:51,560
But compare that to when you just don't say anything.

659
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:54,640
You put the food down, they start making whatever their style.

660
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,080
And then somebody at the table is like, oh, do we have ice?

661
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,280
What's for dessert?

662
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,160
And the kid hears it. Ha ha.

663
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:04,320
Good luck trying to convince them to have five bites, right?

664
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,080
Because you didn't bring it up first.

665
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,720
And now it's a thing. Now it's an actual thing.

666
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:09,560
OK, that's one example.

667
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:14,760
Another example I'll give you is when I started my digital

668
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:19,720
landlords program back in 2021 December at that time, which, by the way,

669
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:22,560
thank goodness, this has kind of gone away at that time.

670
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:25,360
Google was really funny about suspending.

671
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,720
This does happen still.

672
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,960
And so I'll even say it on this call for those of you

673
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,520
that aren't in there yet.

674
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:36,520
Google was very fussy about suspending people on their accounts.

675
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,800
And you would have to verify your account.

676
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,560
They would spend your Google ad account for all kinds of different reasons.

677
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,480
Credit card didn't match.

678
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,080
You were too new to the gate.

679
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,320
No one even knew the answer.

680
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,160
OK, like everyone got suspended, including myself.

681
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,800
It's like they updated this thing and everybody started getting suspended

682
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,760
and everybody started freaking out.

683
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,120
I figured out how to get out of it.

684
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:59,320
And so I realized like there's a pretty damn good chance.

685
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:02,040
And this isn't necessarily as much the case now.

686
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:02,880
It's gotten a lot better.

687
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,040
But it was then when I first started, almost everybody was getting

688
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,040
suspended at some point.

689
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:11,120
And so what I ended up doing, I took the same principle

690
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:15,160
and I told Kyle when he started working with me and helping on board people,

691
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:17,960
I said, every single time you talk about Google ads,

692
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:22,040
I need you to let people know it's not an if, but it's a win.

693
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:26,480
When your ad account gets suspended, here's what you're going to do.

694
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,000
You're not going to freak out.

695
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,840
You're going to reach out to this person and we're going to.

696
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,800
Here's the steps. And it's going to take time.

697
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,080
Sometimes it takes 24 hours.

698
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,560
Sometimes it takes two weeks.

699
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,600
You can't control it. It's just going to happen because it did.

700
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,520
And that was like 80 percent of people were getting suspended, including me.

701
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,920
I got suspended and it was kind of a pain, whatever.

702
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,600
But I figured out how to get out of it.

703
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:47,320
As soon as we started doing that, guess what happened?

704
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,320
When people got the suspension, their posts, their messages went like,

705
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,880
oh, finally got suspended.

706
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,360
What's the next step? Or finally got suspended.

707
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,880
What can anyone offer?

708
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:00,440
Instead of, oh, my gosh, I got suspended, I got

709
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,200
and just freaking out.

710
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,360
If you bring it up first, it is not a thing.

711
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,480
If you don't bring it up first, it is a thing.

712
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,920
Last example I'll give you, because this is such an important thing.

713
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,840
If there's if there's an objection that keeps coming up, OK,

714
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,800
just start eliminating it.

715
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,320
I don't care if it's price, if it's contract,

716
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,920
if you keep seeing the same objection, start bringing it up.

717
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,200
I used to be terrified of flying.

718
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,480
I used to think that like I was going to die in an airplane crash.

719
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,600
Who knows? Maybe I will.

720
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,080
And honestly, I hope that I'm at least over a cool country,

721
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:34,760
like in like a jungle somewhere, not just over like stupid, like, I don't know.

722
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:39,000
Whatever was Lane said, frickin Joplin, Missouri.

723
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:42,320
Imagine I'd much rather die in like some jungle where a predator could eat me.

724
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,880
But I used to be terrified of flying.

725
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,520
I thought that was going to be the end of my life.

726
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,360
Whatever I thought about a lot.

727
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,480
And it would freak me out.

728
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,480
I swear to you, I had a couple of weird experiences

729
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,640
where like we had some really bad turbulence.

730
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,400
I'm like, dude, I'm going down.

731
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,000
Maybe you can relate. Maybe not. OK.

732
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,640
Some of you guys probably just have a few shots and you just sleep.

733
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,640
And that's the solution.

734
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,280
So anyway, this was the thing.

735
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,000
Like it would like consume my mind.

736
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,840
I would be like terrified, honestly, of upcoming flights.

737
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,080
And I remember getting on one flight has come back from Africa

738
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,000
and we were in New York

739
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,040
and there was a huge storm that like shut down the airport.

740
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,640
I was even more terrified.

741
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:22,200
Also, the like four days before that, there was a flight in Ethiopia

742
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,360
that like took off five minutes later, completely crashed.

743
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,760
Everyone on board died.

744
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,560
And by the way, it was the same exact plane as the one I was taking,

745
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,480
because I checked and I was like, oh, that's perfect. OK.

746
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:34,720
But this flight attendant or this pilot, I can't remember which one it was.

747
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,560
They got on the intercom.

748
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,760
They said, hey, look, we're in New York.

749
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,880
There's a storm.

750
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,120
You know, if we do a direct shot from New York to Vegas, there's a storm.

751
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,160
It's it's going to be rough.

752
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,480
So we're actually going to go down.

753
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,400
I think we went all the way down to like

754
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,520
Alabama or something to kind of go around the storm.

755
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,800
He's like, and just so you know, at about this point,

756
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,320
there is going to be turbulence.

757
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,160
It's going to be bumpy because we're getting some drifts from the storm.

758
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,600
That's completely normal.

759
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:59,440
But we should be good by about whatever, Kansas.

760
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,080
I don't remember if that's might be off.

761
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,280
Maybe it's New Mexico.

762
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,200
But he came on the intercom and he said this.

763
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,520
And I was like, OK.

764
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:12,520
And lo and behold, you know, I watched the map.

765
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,760
We went down and there was some pretty

766
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,520
like decent turbulence, like enough that it would have scared

767
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,240
the living daylights out of me.

768
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,800
But because he had brought it up first, I didn't think it was just like, OK,

769
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,760
he told me it's going to happen.

770
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,280
He didn't freak out.

771
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:30,880
Whatever. And so the point is, guys, if you guys will start bringing up,

772
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,480
this is the same for any kind of objection.

773
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,960
But if you will start bringing up these objections,

774
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:38,040
if you will start preemptively seeing the complaints

775
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,120
and the objections of people bringing them up and just

776
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:44,920
not waiting for them to get said to you, but you go to them,

777
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:51,440
it's going to be so much easier for you to overcome

778
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:55,160
or for you to still get the deal despite these things. OK.

779
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,520
So here's an example of what I like to do.

780
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,880
And I like to just bring it up.

781
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,600
And typically I bring it up on my sales call.

782
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:06,000
Now, this is part of my script that I have for those that are in digital

783
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,800
landlords. So those of you that are in, you'll see this as part of the script.

784
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,960
But this is one of the things that I'll say is, you know, near the end,

785
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,160
when I'm getting ready to close, I'll be like, you know, it's flat fee, whatever.

786
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,480
But just so you know, it's going to be completely transparent with you

787
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,360
because sometimes they'll ask a question, right?

788
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:24,720
Like, how many leads can we expect? Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

789
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,080
And I'll say, look, Mr.

790
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,840
Business Hunter, let me be completely transparent with you.

791
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:31,600
There are going to be some months that are super slow, some some months

792
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,640
and some weeks that we're going to get no leads.

793
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,800
That's just the fact. Christmas.

794
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,560
Just go ahead and don't expect any leads.

795
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:41,080
Everyone is out drinking eggnog, whatever, spiked eggnog

796
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,920
and spending their money on whatever.

797
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,880
Like, just just go ahead and put it in your head.

798
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,440
You're not going to get any leads. That's just Christmas.

799
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:49,120
OK. And it's probably good timing because you're probably going to want to be

800
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,080
with your family anyway. But that is the truth.

801
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,720
It's going to be slow. OK.

802
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,600
No one's thinking no disrespect.

803
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,680
No one's thinking about putting up a fence during Christmas.

804
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,800
Todd, OK.

805
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,960
Not to say Todd's in here, but that's just a business on our example.

806
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:05,200
And then I'll say, but there's also going to be some months

807
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:08,560
that are going to be super busy like this.

808
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,400
You know, when people start getting their tax returns,

809
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,560
we're going to see a spike.

810
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:14,400
When it starts to get warm, you're going to start to see a spike.

811
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,920
But here's the deal. It's going to even out.

812
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:20,280
I'm not going to come and charge you extra money because we have a huge spike

813
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:23,400
in leads during tax returns or during the warm season or because of this

814
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,960
weather or that weather.

815
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,600
And on the flip side, you know, I'm not going to pause

816
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,160
payments or lower the price when it gets a little bit slow.

817
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,720
It all is going to even itself out.

818
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,480
So as long as we're on the same page,

819
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,120
I'm not going to do some kind of surge pricing like Uber does

820
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,000
just because we have a huge influx.

821
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,080
But you've got to be just just promise me you'll be patient with me

822
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,320
and not call and complain when things get a little bit slow,

823
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:47,560
because that's just going to be the case. OK, done.

824
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,160
That's all you've got to say.

825
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:49,840
Does that sound good, Mr.

826
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,920
Winsor? And if guys, if you say this two to three minute thing,

827
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,920
you are setting the expectation.

828
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,840
It takes literally 30 seconds to three minutes.

829
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,160
You could say that exact same thing.

830
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,920
I just said you saying that up front, being very clear,

831
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,720
very honest with them.

832
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:09,040
It is going to save you so many phone calls, so much heartache,

833
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,920
so many setbacks, so many.

834
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,960
I got to resell the deal to this person.

835
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,040
I got to find a new business owner.

836
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:19,720
It will save you so much in terms of resources, time, energy, money, etc.

837
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:23,640
If you don't, good luck, because you are going to get phone calls.

838
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,520
It takes you 30 seconds to three minutes.

839
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:29,680
If you do not, you are going to have a issue

840
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,480
because it's going to happen.

841
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,720
You're going to have things slow down.

842
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,440
So why not just bring it up first?

843
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:37,800
Now, for those of you that are on there like, oh, my gosh, I sold a business owner.

844
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:42,000
I didn't bring it up. What do I do?

845
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,360
Well, what you do is what I'm going to talk about

846
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,840
in my very last section of this training when we're talking about contracts.

847
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:54,400
But I just want to like emphasize to you guys that, you know, a lot of business,

848
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,280
a lot of like relationships is setting and managing expectations.

849
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,040
If a business owner is expecting that it's going to get slow in December.

850
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,000
It's not going to be a big deal.

851
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,560
If a business owner thinks it's going to be just great all year round.

852
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,560
It's going to be a thing. It's going to be a real thing.

853
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,280
You have to set the proper expectations and then manage those expectations.

854
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:21,960
And the other thing that happens, guys, I know when you when I say that,

855
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,280
you know, that line that I said, which is like, hey, just so you know,

856
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,400
it's going to be slow during Christmas.

857
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:32,000
I know in some of your minds, you might think that's going to hurt the deal.

858
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:36,000
But, you know, it's actually going to do the opposite because you being honest,

859
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,880
you, you know, painting this picture that's not 100 percent perfect

860
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:44,040
and making it seem real is going to create more trust with you.

861
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:48,560
And again, I've said this so many times, trust is the hardest objection to overcome.

862
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,480
And no deal is perfect.

863
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,040
No service is perfect. No business is perfect.

864
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,440
And so if you paint this picture of everything's going to be perfect

865
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,480
and the numbers are going to be great, you're going to make all this money.

866
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,560
It's going to sound too good to be true because it probably is.

867
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:06,000
So just know that when you say things like that and you don't just say,

868
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,080
yeah, it's going to be great and blah, blah, blah, and it should just be fine.

869
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,000
Just say it as it is, man.

870
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
It's probably going to be slow in the winter, dude.

871
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,400
That's just the truth. You know, that's just how it is.

872
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,920
So, you know, and if they start complaining, like, yeah, sure.

873
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,720
If you want me to, you know, if you want me to lower the price

874
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,720
during the winter, that's fine.

875
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:26,400
But when I I'm going to also charge you extra

876
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:31,360
when we start getting a surge in tax time and during the spring

877
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,000
and during, you know, the storms that increase.

878
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,320
So that's how I get around that.

879
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:41,560
OK, so just so you guys know, that's all you have to do is those two to three minutes.

880
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,600
Sometimes it can be 30 seconds.

881
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:46,240
And that will save you so much time.

882
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:49,480
OK, last thing I want to cover is how to make sure

883
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,800
that your contracts actually match the seasons.

884
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:55,440
OK, number one, I oh, by the way,

885
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,760
I know people that have that are in this game that don't do contracts.

886
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:02,600
And that's completely fine. That's their decision.

887
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,000
Contracts make me sleep at night.

888
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,440
Now, I have a whole thing.

889
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,000
I could go on because I'm going to say it, but contracts make me sleep.

890
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,880
And I have a contract on every single person I work with as much to set

891
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:17,560
expectations, just like I just said, as much to set expectations

892
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:21,400
as it is to actually legally bind them to the thing that we've agreed to.

893
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:24,480
OK, so number one, I always do contracts.

894
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,960
Number two, I always do a six month minimum contract if I can help.

895
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:30,320
But there are situations I'll do three months. OK.

896
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:35,400
But I also have a rule with contracts is I never let a contract expire

897
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:40,240
in the winter. OK, so or as things are starting to dip.

898
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:44,480
So I'm never going to let a contract expire in November, as it's probably

899
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,760
going to be slower than October, which means we're going downhill.

900
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,600
And then even if I sign them, it's going to be tough

901
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:53,680
because then in December, it's just tough, guys.

902
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:57,320
So I never let a contract expire during the slowdown

903
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:00,480
or during the winter months. OK. Period. End of story.

904
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:06,200
So what I'll do like right now, six months from now, it's it's July.

905
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,520
This is putting us in like it's a perfect example.

906
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:11,280
If we had a contract, right, that was six months.

907
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,320
We're I think we're going to end in December.

908
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:17,280
Like we're going to literally end December 29th, which is terrible.

909
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:20,160
You're going to be in the in the worst two weeks of the year. OK.

910
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:23,120
You're going to be trying to get them to sign a new contract

911
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:26,200
coming off the worst month of the year, the slowest month of the year

912
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,880
for most businesses. Good luck. It's going to be tough.

913
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:31,200
It's going to be very, very it's going to be tough to even keep them,

914
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,200
much less get them to sign a contract.

915
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:40,880
So what I typically do is like from right now until we get to about October.

916
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:44,560
So I'd say from now, August through the end of September,

917
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:49,280
maybe even mid October, I am going to be selling a either a nine month

918
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,520
contract or a three month contract.

919
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:55,520
OK, because I would rather my contract go August, September, October

920
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:59,880
ends in October and then I sign them for another six months or a year,

921
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:05,000
ideally a year, or I go August, September, October, November,

922
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,520
December, January, February, March, April.

923
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,400
OK, that's nine months.

924
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:14,160
I'd way rather my contract end in April after tax returns,

925
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:17,040
spring cleaning is starting to get warm, etc.

926
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:23,440
Then I would in November, December, January, February.

927
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,120
Do not sign a contract that's going to expire in those months.

928
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:30,360
November, December, January, February.

929
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,120
Don't have to listen to me. Go test it. Good luck.

930
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:36,680
Now, here's what I'll say to wrap this up.

931
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:40,240
Those of you that have signed contracts didn't even think about it.

932
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,160
You sign a six month contract, it's ending in December.

933
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,720
Oh, my gosh, what am I going to do?

934
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:49,200
Or you somehow signed one and then they wouldn't agree to an extension.

935
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:52,320
So you're on a month to month or you signed an extension that puts

936
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,040
and you just didn't even think about it. OK, here's what you do.

937
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:57,920
This is what I do is once winter starts to approach.

938
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,080
Usually for me, it's around like September.

939
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:03,960
I'll do an audit on all my clients. OK, how happy are they?

940
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:06,080
How many leads are we getting?

941
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:09,600
How many are they closing? How generally speaking, one to ten?

942
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,520
What's the health of the relationship? Is it is it a seven plus?

943
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:16,240
OK, we might be OK. Eight plus, we're definitely OK.

944
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:20,120
Anything less than a seven, then I'm going to take some action.

945
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:22,120
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to make October

946
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:26,080
end of September, maybe mid-September to mid-October.

947
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:30,240
I'm going to make it the most amazing 30 days they've ever worked with me. OK.

948
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:33,960
I am going to make sure that these guys remember who I am.

949
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,440
They know where the leads are coming from.

950
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:40,160
And I'll even go to the extent, guys, I'll go and I'll put on ads, you know,

951
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:46,480
150 bucks to 250 dollars in ads to supplement these deals.

952
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,560
Even if it puts me at a break even or a negative,

953
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:54,520
I will do that to get them to have this amazing last month with me.

954
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:57,800
And I will let them know like about two weeks out.

955
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:00,960
I'll be like, hey, I want to discuss with you about, you know, working together.

956
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:05,240
And I'll resign them into an agreement, even if my first one's not done yet.

957
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:07,760
We'll say, hey, let's just end that one, sign a new one.

958
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:10,720
I'll make sure they have the best 30 days of their life.

959
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,680
And then I'll go pitch the agreement. OK.

960
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:14,960
But if this is the reason I want to talk about this right now,

961
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:18,440
even though it's just barely the end of, you know, July 1st of August,

962
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,880
you guys have to start thinking about what kind of contracts you're selling

963
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:25,360
and then how to handle the contracts that you have sold

964
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:28,760
that are going to be putting you at a really bad time. OK.

965
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:32,000
Guys, there's nothing wrong, by the way, with running 150 bucks,

966
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,000
200 dollars, 250 bucks per month in ads for 30 days

967
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:38,880
to sign another six month agreement for six thousand dollars

968
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:41,360
at a 50 percent profit margin. That's three thousand dollars.

969
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:43,120
You're spending two hundred and fifty.

970
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:45,200
You're making three thousand net in your pocket.

971
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,240
That's a 10 X return.

972
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:49,080
It's not a bad use of money if I don't say.

973
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:52,080
And I'm not a math genius, but that sounds like one dollar for ten.

974
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:54,720
Sounds great. OK. You got to be strategic.

975
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:56,240
These are all the guys.

976
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:59,360
These are all the nuances. I never would have known this.

977
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:02,080
I was never taught this.

978
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:03,680
I was in all kinds of different programs.

979
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,960
No one talked to me about what to do in the winter,

980
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:10,440
what how to tee it up, how to get people, you know, juiced up

981
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:11,240
so I could resign.

982
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:14,320
And no one told me I for sure should do a contract. OK.

983
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:17,600
And you guys can run the business you want the way that you want to run it.

984
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:20,280
But again, the thing that I think you should consider

985
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:23,240
is what I said at the beginning is that I don't give advice.

986
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:25,280
I don't come on these calls unless I've done it.

987
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,080
And I have lost a lot of money.

988
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:30,800
I've had some very dark,

989
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,200
some cold, dark nights in the winter.

990
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:38,240
And I mean that in terms of physically because it's cold and it's dark.

991
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:39,320
Early is December.

992
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:42,640
And mentally, because I'm like, I don't know.

993
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:47,400
When you are in the winter months and you are on paper lead

994
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:51,120
or you just lost two clients and you only have four clients.

995
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,440
It feels like like heavy, man.

996
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:56,600
You're like, dude, is this business ever going to be good again?

997
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,760
And then sure enough, by like end of February, March,

998
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:02,560
things start to pick up, you start landing clients, people start calling you.

999
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:04,240
Hey, let's talk about that deal.

1000
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,760
But it becomes very dark and it's very easy to give up.

1001
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:08,160
It's very easy to get sidetracked.

1002
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:11,840
It's very easy to start jumping to the next thing and having Chinese object syndrome.

1003
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:16,000
So we're talking about this at the beginning of August and end of July

1004
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,200
because it's coming up quick.

1005
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:21,040
And I want you guys, as you sell your deals,

1006
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:24,200
start selling deals right now to be thinking, hey,

1007
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:25,720
let's either do a three month or nine.

1008
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:27,480
I would prefer you guys do a nine month,

1009
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:30,120
but three months better than a six month right now,

1010
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:33,560
which I only would say because of the time of the year.

1011
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:36,160
And these are just things that you guys have to think about. OK.

1012
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:41,080
So imagine there is so much to this business that we've been able to talk about this.

1013
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:45,000
One thing, the seasonality of niches, which I have a million other things

1014
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,160
I could cover on this, but this is the overall the gist of this thing.

1015
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:51,080
This is this is what you need to know about the seasonality of niches.

1016
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:53,320
It does exist. It does affect everybody.

1017
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:58,760
And you need to do things to not have it affect you slash.

1018
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:02,680
If you have made mistakes, you need to do things to fight it

1019
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:06,320
and correct it and nip it in the bud before it becomes a problem. OK.

1020
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,880
Again, I'm just one person.

1021
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:13,720
However, I have been able to use this model to literally build my dream life.

1022
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:17,760
The the the exact thing that I wanted to do in 2016

1023
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,800
when I signed up for my first program.

1024
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,320
I remember they asked me like, what do you want?

1025
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:22,520
Why do you want to join this?

1026
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:23,920
What do you want to do?

1027
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:27,800
And all I could think like above the money, above whatever.

1028
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,240
There's two things.

1029
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:31,880
Number one, the idea of being able to get out of my bed,

1030
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:36,520
throw on a bathrobe and my slippers, walk into my office,

1031
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:40,840
sit down and make money without having to go out in the heat

1032
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:43,360
and make, you know, cold calls or cold knocks.

1033
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:45,880
That sounded beyond amazing.

1034
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:48,680
Like I couldn't even fathom that was a thing.

1035
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:51,080
And this is before everyone is making money online.

1036
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:53,040
I was like, how could what? That sounds amazing.

1037
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,640
I can do it from home and then I can be done and just go to the fridge

1038
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:57,720
and not have to have. It sounded amazing.

1039
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:00,840
Number two was being able to travel the world

1040
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:05,320
and make not just make enough, but make millions of dollars.

1041
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:07,600
I wanted to see the world. I wanted to see.

1042
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:09,920
I wanted to move to Africa.

1043
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,880
I wanted to. That was a place that was very important to me.

1044
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:13,120
I wanted to take my family there.

1045
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:15,000
I wanted to see different places.

1046
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,080
I wanted to go when it got cold.

1047
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:19,200
I didn't want to be anywhere near the cold.

1048
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,600
That was one of the things I didn't want to.

1049
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:22,080
I don't want to see snow for me.

1050
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:23,840
You guys, if you're skiers, that's cool.

1051
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:26,080
And that's your thing. I don't ever want to see the cold.

1052
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:29,720
And so it's it's been really, really fun.

1053
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:31,280
And just being able to do this.

1054
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,080
I'm in Dubai right now. If you guys didn't know this,

1055
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:34,440
I'm in Dubai right now.

1056
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:36,280
I've spent time in London. I spent time in Paris.

1057
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:37,360
I spent time in Africa.

1058
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:42,360
And it's only halfway through the year, I guess, eight months, seven months.

1059
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:45,400
But I'm just telling you guys this because

1060
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:48,360
I know some of you guys are sitting there stuck in a job,

1061
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:52,120
stuck in a nine to five or stuck in a business that you can't move

1062
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:54,040
because it's it's a business that is state.

1063
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:57,760
It's it's you have to be there in order for the business to run.

1064
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:01,160
And I'm just here to tell you guys that like it's man.

1065
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:04,880
I personally just think life's too short to not see this entire planet.

1066
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:08,320
If you're not going to travel, I think life's too short to have to be at work.

1067
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:11,360
I was talking to somebody about this yesterday,

1068
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:15,440
and I'm sure you guys have heard this, you know, a third of our life,

1069
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:19,120
a third of our life, statistically, is spent at work.

1070
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:23,480
A third. And I would assume another third spent sleeping.

1071
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:25,640
So a third of it spent at work, a third of it spent sleeping.

1072
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,120
And some of you guys hate what you do.

1073
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:30,560
And some of you guys maybe don't hate what you do,

1074
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:31,960
but you hate where you're doing it with.

1075
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:34,640
Some of you guys maybe don't hate what you're doing it with or what you do,

1076
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,320
but you hate, you know, the hours you have to do it.

1077
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:41,680
And so I guess it's like, dude, you have a vehicle right in front of you

1078
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:46,440
building simple assets, doing digital, building a digital real estate portfolio,

1079
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,080
getting passive income and living whatever life you want to live.

1080
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:51,600
If that means you want to be in Dubai, be in Dubai.

1081
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:55,800
If that means you want to be in freaking whoever, wherever, Kansas and,

1082
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:58,760
and, you know, hang out where you grew up.

1083
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,560
That's it doesn't do that.

1084
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:02,440
It's the best part. It doesn't matter.

1085
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:03,880
By the way, I don't know if that's where you grew up, Lane.

1086
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:07,480
I'm just that that no man's land, Kansas or Missouri thing.

1087
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:09,520
It's hilarious. It's up to you.

1088
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:13,480
You get to choose whatever life you want to live and go.

1089
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:15,560
And this business will fit around it.

1090
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:19,200
So I hope this was helpful for you guys.

1091
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:23,160
There wasn't a ton of time for quite for questions, so I didn't even bother today.

1092
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:26,160
But feel free to drop those inside of the Facebook group.

1093
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:29,400
We also just one last reminder, guys, is

1094
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:31,720
the digital resource we're going to create from this.

1095
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:33,880
We will send it out to all of you guys that are on this call.

1096
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,480
And yeah. And lastly, I've said this, if you guys haven't seen,

1097
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:41,280
I made a new welcome post inside of the group.

1098
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:44,680
But pay attention to what I'm doing, not just what I'm saying.

1099
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:46,600
Why do you guys think? Think about this.

1100
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:48,920
Why do you guys think I'm coming on and I'm doing these lives?

1101
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:51,560
Why do you think I'm this? You guys didn't pay me.

1102
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:53,520
I don't even know. Some of you guys don't even have your name on here.

1103
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:56,040
Got Discord user. Right. I don't know who you are.

1104
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:00,800
That's fine. But what I know is that if you guys are paying attention,

1105
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:04,240
you guys can see I'm using my same exact process

1106
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:06,920
that I teach inside of digital landlords.

1107
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:11,880
I am using it right now with you guys and I am giving you guys free leads.

1108
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:15,520
Free leads being you guys are interested in this model.

1109
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:18,200
You guys are interested in getting potentially getting involved.

1110
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,520
You guys are interested in potentially, you know,

1111
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:22,720
creating passive income with this model and doing this.

1112
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:25,800
And I'm like, hey, I don't you know, I'm here to earn your business.

1113
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:28,200
Of course, I'm not, you know, just a philanthropist.

1114
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:31,400
But let me you guys test this out.

1115
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:34,320
See what see what you think about some of my life, some of my trainings.

1116
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,200
Think about the stuff that I'm giving away for free.

1117
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:39,640
Think about what it's like to work with me on a paid level. OK.

1118
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:43,640
So I just want you to know that anything you see me do inside of my group,

1119
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:46,400
I want you to not just listen to what I'm saying, but pay attention to what I'm

1120
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:47,800
doing. Guys, appreciate you being on.

1121
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:52,120
We'll send you that resource and we will see you guys inside of the free group.

1122
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:53,560
Next week. I'm out.
