1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,880
All right guys, this is where the rubber meets the road. You can do all the previous steps

2
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,560
that we've talked about. You can pick the perfect city and the perfect niche. You can

3
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:24,180
build this great list. You can go and set up ads. If you do not call, if you do not

4
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,980
do this step because of whatever reason, whether you're scared, whether you tell yourself you

5
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:34,740
don't have time, it does not matter the reason. If you do not do this step, you will not make

6
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:38,660
money. You will not get deals. In order for you to close deals, you need to get people

7
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:41,620
on Zoom. In order for you to get people on Zoom, you need to send them leads. In order

8
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:44,980
for you to send them leads, you have to call them and get them hooked. In order to hook

9
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:51,260
them, you need to prospect them. You need to make the calls. Okay? Look, I understand

10
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:57,300
this part can be very intimidating. This part can be scary, but it's only scary because

11
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:02,100
you have been calling the wrong people. You haven't had the necessary scripts, which I'm

12
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:07,580
going to give you, and that's all about to change. A lot of you have seen other people

13
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:13,980
in this program that were terrified of the phone, that were absolutely doing everything

14
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:20,020
they could to avoid this one thing. Ironically, this is the one thing that is going to make

15
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:25,260
the difference between you making money and you not. I want to talk about why do we have

16
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:30,500
to do this uncomfortable step? Why can't we just skip it? Why this piece? Because this

17
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,820
is the part that everyone's the most scared of, so I want to talk about that really quick.

18
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:39,380
Number one reason why we have to do this is because this is the one thing that every other

19
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:44,940
agency owner out there avoids, and you watching this have been avoiding this most likely up

20
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:49,940
until now. You've done the email campaigns, you've done the messenger chats, you've done

21
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:56,340
Facebook posts and everything to avoid this thing. If you're avoiding it, every other

22
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,540
marketer is avoiding it. We all know there are programs out there that are trying to

23
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:06,980
teach you that you can get deals without cold calling. You can get deals by hiding behind

24
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:12,280
your computer. You can get deals with email drips. Guess what? Most of those things will

25
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:18,740
work to some extent. However, what I understand is that the things that people are unwilling

26
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:25,820
to do, if I do them, I am going to have massive success very quickly. Number one reason that

27
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:32,180
we're going to do this is because no one else wants to. My entire philosophy of life and

28
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:39,180
with this process is I want to zig while they zag. If everybody's doing this, I want to

29
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:44,900
do this because if everyone's doing something one way and most people are broke, I should

30
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:50,780
probably look the other way. Second reason, guys, money loves speed. I'm going to say

31
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:56,300
that a thousand times during this training and a thousand more times during my live calls

32
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:02,660
and a thousand more times in our conversations in the chat and one on ones. Money loves speed.

33
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:06,760
The quickest way to get to a business owner is not through an email, it's not through

34
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:13,760
a messenger, it's not through a this, it's through picking up the phone and calling the

35
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:19,980
person as long as we have the right number, as long as we're calling the right person.

36
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:24,740
This is the quickest way to get deals. I don't know about you, but the reason that I'm in

37
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:29,500
this, the reason that I discovered this process and I learned this process and I mastered

38
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:35,260
this process is because I wanted to speed it up. Guys, if you don't want to speed this

39
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:41,340
up, go do rank and rent. This is rent then rank. We're looking for speed. Money loves

40
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:45,660
speed. The reason why we're going to do this quote unquote, and I say quote unquote because

41
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:49,500
I promise you when you have the right scripts, you have somebody that knows what they're

42
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,460
doing because they've done it thousands of times and you're calling the right people,

43
00:03:53,460 --> 00:04:00,180
this is not anything like cold calling as people define it. We are calling people who

44
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,960
are already interested in our product, who are already paying for our product from somebody

45
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:10,960
else more than likely and we're giving them results in advance with a script that works.

46
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:17,140
This is not scary, at least compared to knocking doors and selling home security systems, selling

47
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:22,940
vacuums, doing actual cold calling. The second reason we're going to do this quote unquote

48
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:28,300
uncomfortable step is because it's quick. It's fast. It gets us the yes or no as quickly

49
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,940
as possible so we can move on to the next so we can make money.

50
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:37,020
Third reason that we're going to do this uncomfortable, again, uncomfortable step is because it works.

51
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:43,260
It works and it always will. I believe one of the most barbaric old school things in

52
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:47,680
the world is going door to door. I do not believe in going door to door to door. I did

53
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,020
it for four years and you know what's crazy? As much as I don't believe in it, I think

54
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:54,820
there's so much better uses of your time than literally getting dropped off in a neighborhood

55
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:58,700
and going door to door to door with all the technology and the information that we have.

56
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:04,700
I do not think that's a good use of your time, yet it still worked, guys. It still worked

57
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:10,740
to the tune of me making hundreds of thousands of dollars in a summer and it is the most

58
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:15,740
barbaric method out there. What we're going to do is we're going to take the concepts

59
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:20,140
of that, which is direct to customer. We're going to go direct to customer, direct to

60
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:23,440
the business owner, but we're going to have some information. We're going to talk to only

61
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,940
people who are paying for leads, people who are already sold, and we're going to give

62
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:32,360
them results in advance. Two things I did not do when I did my barbaric method. This

63
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:38,400
works. When I say this, I mean reaching directly out. We're going to call it cold calling,

64
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:44,040
but I almost want you to think of this as warm calling. The third reason that we're

65
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,960
going to do this quote unquote uncomfortable step is because it works. The fourth reason

66
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:52,520
why we do this uncomfortable step, and I laugh every time I say uncomfortable because compared

67
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,560
to other stuff, this is not uncomfortable, but the fourth reason why we do this is because

68
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:03,560
we are in charge. We are in charge of, and we can control that we pick up the phone and

69
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:10,080
we dial a number and we call. I can control that. I can't always control if my email gets

70
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:16,720
blocked. I can't always control if the business owner looks at their message or whatever,

71
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,320
but when I pick up the phone and I call the phone number, I'm in total control. Now yes,

72
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,040
I guess technically you could say, well, they might not answer, but I'm telling you right

73
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:29,520
now 99% of the people that we're targeting, their personal cell phone is the one that's

74
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:35,000
listed on the business. That is how low, that is the type of caliber of people that we are

75
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,480
going after. We are going to be talking to most of these people directly to their personal

76
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:45,240
cell phone. I'd say 90% of the people you're going to call, you're going to be calling

77
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,280
their personal cell. You're not even going to be working, you're not even going to be

78
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:53,720
dealing with a secretary or a tracking number or any of that. Definitely not an 800 number.

79
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,480
We're talking directly to them. What I love about doing this is it puts us in control.

80
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:01,240
We can sit down every day and say, hey, I'm going to make X amount of calls and I'm not

81
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:06,560
going to have to worry about my email being blocked or this happening or my account being

82
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,520
suspended here. We are in control. We could pick up the phone and for some reason our

83
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,120
phone gets spammed out or whatever, it gets blocked. We can go get another number. It

84
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:23,480
allows us to be in control. So guys, this is the step. This is the part where if you,

85
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:28,640
this is the reality. If you do not do this step, you will not make money. So if this

86
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:34,160
scares you, good. If this process, if this part of the process frightens you, terrifies

87
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:40,920
you, welcome to the club. To this day, even me at this point, although this isn't near

88
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,440
as bad as going door to door, it still gives me the butterflies and it probably always

89
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:53,440
will and that to me just identifies, it just confirms that I'm doing the right thing.

90
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:58,440
So guys, let's jump in and let's freaking get a business owner on the hook.
