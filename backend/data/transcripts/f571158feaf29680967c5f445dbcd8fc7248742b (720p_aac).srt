00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
Okay, Ariel says, why do you not touch the ones that have CPC as NA?

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,960
So the reason why real quick on that, Ariel, is because typically with CPC,

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,240
think about it, right?

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,280
Supply and demand.

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:19,760
So if the cost per click is zero, that means there's nobody else bidding on it, right?

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,120
There's no marketers.

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,240
There's no business owners.

8
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,080
There's no one else that's wanting to pay for those ads,

9
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:29,680
which I can therefore infer that it's worth nothing, right?

10
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,840
So for example, you're going to have a keyword like

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,640
cheap concrete companies in Newport, whatever, right?

12
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,320
That CPC is zero.

13
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,560
Why? Because no one cares about it.

14
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,760
So if you want to go like those CPCs,

15
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,840
the reason why is because it's typically it's a waste of time, right?

16
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,280
There's no volume.

17
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,640
It says there's volume, but it's not worth anything.

18
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,320
So if you want to go test it out, cool.

19
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,760
And there's probably like a couple situations where, yeah, it's going to work.

20
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:02,640
But I'm just using my intuition of saying, okay, there's CPC that's zero,

21
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,440
which means nobody cares enough to pay for it,

22
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,280
which means there's like one of many things, right?

23
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,880
There's too much supply and not enough demand or vice versa.

24
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,240
So that's why, okay?

25
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,040
Hope that makes sense.
