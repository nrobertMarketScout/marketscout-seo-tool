00:00.000 --> 00:07.120
All right, guys, let's jump into, I'm gonna get my notes here because I don't want to

00:07.120 --> 00:08.120
miss anything.

00:08.120 --> 00:14.760
Okay, so first and foremost, last week it was interesting and I don't want this to come

00:14.760 --> 00:15.880
across wrong.

00:15.880 --> 00:21.600
I used to be the screaming the mic guy and I realized that was just not me.

00:21.600 --> 00:23.920
Actually it is me sometimes, but not always.

00:23.920 --> 00:28.760
But last week was interesting because I was, you know, I woke up in the morning, I forgot,

00:28.760 --> 00:31.000
I'm in Dubai so I forgot it was that even Labor Day.

00:31.000 --> 00:35.120
It's weird some holidays that you kind of forget when you're traveling.

00:35.120 --> 00:38.720
But I remembered eventually because my brother Porter, if you guys might know him, he's in

00:38.720 --> 00:39.720
the free group.

00:39.720 --> 00:42.600
He's about, he's at like 6,400 bucks a month.

00:42.600 --> 00:44.600
It's his birthday, always on Labor Day.

00:44.600 --> 00:48.280
So I remembered and I started thinking back to like previous Labor Days and I don't remember

00:48.280 --> 00:52.200
any of them, like actually none of them except for one.

00:52.200 --> 00:57.680
And that was in 2017 and I posted about this and I put 18, I think I said six years ago

00:57.680 --> 00:59.440
but it was actually seven.

00:59.440 --> 01:08.440
This is 2017 and this is literally about five weeks after I failed my first business.

01:08.440 --> 01:13.840
I got started into RankinRent, I got a couple deals and then I got shiny penny syndrome

01:13.840 --> 01:18.320
and I thought, man, I think I'm going to start a software company because that sounds cool.

01:18.320 --> 01:23.160
I swear to you, if you think I'm lying, I promise you that when I say that, I literally

01:23.160 --> 01:26.320
just didn't think it sounded cool to tell people I did marketing.

01:26.320 --> 01:28.480
That was one of the main determining factors.

01:28.480 --> 01:33.320
That's how stupid I was as a, how old did I have been, eight years?

01:33.320 --> 01:36.000
I was like 25 and I was still dumb.

01:36.000 --> 01:40.680
I thought it sounded cool to say I had a software company but now I realize it's cool, no matter

01:40.680 --> 01:44.040
what you're doing, to make money because that's what really matters, that's what we're here

01:44.040 --> 01:45.040
for.

01:45.040 --> 01:51.480
Anyway, I had got shiny penny syndrome, I chased this software idea, I failed, I lost

01:51.480 --> 01:52.480
tons of money.

01:52.640 --> 01:59.160
I wasted nine months and it came to this boiling point on, it was either July 27th or July

01:59.160 --> 02:00.160
28th.

02:00.160 --> 02:03.080
I think it was the 28th because that would be, yeah, I think it was the 28th and I'm

02:03.080 --> 02:07.720
in my living room and I'm telling my wife for the fifth, sixth, seventh time, she's

02:07.720 --> 02:10.400
like, so what's going on with the business?

02:10.400 --> 02:16.400
I was so annoyed at this point because nothing, at least for men, I don't know for you ladies

02:16.400 --> 02:21.040
if it's the same, but when my wife would ask me about money, it's like she was questioning

02:21.600 --> 02:28.240
me as a person and my abilities and it was really, really hurtful and she again was like,

02:28.240 --> 02:32.760
so what's going on, give me an update and I didn't have one.

02:32.760 --> 02:37.920
I was like, well, the developer said that we're like two weeks away from beta and he'd

02:37.920 --> 02:40.480
been saying this for like six months.

02:40.480 --> 02:45.760
She finally looked at me and she's like, you know this guy is scamming you, right?

02:45.760 --> 02:49.400
You know that this is not happening.

02:49.440 --> 02:54.080
I knew as she said it that she was right and essentially without going into too much detail,

02:54.080 --> 02:59.320
I paid this guy 60 grand, 50 grand and we'd split it, me and a partner, but then I had

02:59.320 --> 03:01.400
bought him out because I found some stuff out.

03:01.400 --> 03:07.280
So now I was 50, 60 grand in of my own money plus nine months of my time plus the opportunity

03:07.280 --> 03:09.480
cost of not going and doing door to door sales.

03:09.480 --> 03:10.480
I had no money.

03:10.480 --> 03:16.760
Like I literally had no money and we had bills due at the first of the month and she's like,

03:16.760 --> 03:19.720
she basically was like, it's time for you to start taking care of this family and it

03:19.720 --> 03:24.600
was like one of those like, my goodness, I needed to hear that and it took me a long

03:24.600 --> 03:27.720
time to even be able to say that out loud, but it was very embarrassing.

03:27.720 --> 03:33.240
It was, it killed my confidence, but it was that day that I realized like I have to change

03:33.240 --> 03:34.600
and I have a failed business.

03:34.600 --> 03:36.840
My first one's I'm all for one.

03:36.840 --> 03:42.200
I have to make a change and so I went and did the only thing that I knew how was I was

03:42.200 --> 03:46.480
like, dude, where's that program that I bought like a year ago?

03:46.480 --> 03:49.600
Let me just go start selling something and I started watching the training and I was

03:49.600 --> 03:53.560
like, what's the easiest thing to sell and I was like, I'm going to go sell a couple

03:53.560 --> 03:54.560
of websites.

03:54.560 --> 04:01.080
Let me go sell a couple of websites with SEO and I, so I told my wife, I said, you know,

04:01.080 --> 04:03.960
she's like, I need, you need to call this person, this person, like maybe it's time

04:03.960 --> 04:07.320
you just go get a job and I was like, I can't, like I've talked too much crap.

04:07.320 --> 04:11.160
I'm not going back to my job and which was a door to door salesperson and I'm not going

04:11.160 --> 04:13.400
to get a 95.

04:13.400 --> 04:17.520
So I said, give me till the first of the month, which was three days from that day and I will

04:17.520 --> 04:21.920
have however much we need and we needed $3,000 to basically cover our bills and she's like,

04:21.920 --> 04:22.920
okay, sounds good.

04:22.920 --> 04:24.160
I'll give you three days.

04:24.160 --> 04:28.920
No chance I'm getting it and guys in three days out of desperation and it's funny how

04:28.920 --> 04:32.280
humans are like this when our backs up against the wall, we are so creative.

04:32.280 --> 04:37.200
We are so resourceful and in three days I came up with $3,000 cash, sold three websites

04:38.200 --> 04:44.880
and was able to buy myself another 30 days and then so essentially I used SEO to kind

04:44.880 --> 04:48.280
of get me out of that situation and then I transitioned and I just did it too slow and

04:48.280 --> 04:49.280
I didn't do it correctly.

04:49.280 --> 04:52.840
So whoever it was that said, you know, they're doing SEO, there's nothing wrong with SEO.

04:52.840 --> 04:56.000
There's just a proper way to do it and there's a wrong way to do it and it's very easy to

04:56.000 --> 05:01.840
get stuck in the wrong way and to chase the money only to end up in a year with nothing,

05:01.840 --> 05:05.780
with no assets, with nothing that you can tie the clients to.

05:05.780 --> 05:09.660
So anyway, the reason I'm telling this whole story, five weeks after this because that

05:09.660 --> 05:15.140
would have been, you know, September, beginning of September, I just remember on Labor Day,

05:15.140 --> 05:20.020
I'd been working my butt off like truly, truly, truly I'd been working my butt off and I made

05:20.020 --> 05:21.020
good money.

05:21.020 --> 05:26.260
I made $3,000 in three days and I made 10,000 bucks my very first month going all in on

05:26.260 --> 05:29.620
SEO and that was cash collected because I needed to.

05:29.620 --> 05:34.780
I had kids, I had bills, all this stuff and Labor Day, I remember it was Sunday night

05:34.780 --> 05:39.980
going into Monday and I thought to myself, like, I want to spend time with my kids.

05:39.980 --> 05:44.740
I was at my parents' house and I was like, I want to go to the parade and, you know,

05:44.740 --> 05:49.300
like spend some time with them because I haven't spent much time but I was like, I need to

05:49.300 --> 05:54.260
like, I got stuff to do and I just remember I woke up, I needed to write 3,000 words of

05:54.260 --> 05:55.260
content.

05:55.260 --> 05:56.420
Yes, I used to write my own content.

05:56.420 --> 06:02.340
I wrote my first 300,000 words of content just for the record and I woke up at 4 a.m.

06:02.340 --> 06:07.140
And I sat in my parents' kitchen with it completely quiet and I picked away the keyboard

06:07.140 --> 06:12.100
and I wrote 3,000 words of content before I went to the gym and I showered and went

06:12.100 --> 06:13.420
to the parade.

06:13.420 --> 06:19.860
And I remember that because I was so tired, of course, because I woke up at 4 a.m., but

06:19.860 --> 06:24.060
I was so excited to be making money.

06:24.060 --> 06:29.980
I was so, it was so refreshing to know that like even if it was a thousand bucks, it was

06:29.980 --> 06:30.980
my money.

06:30.980 --> 06:36.900
It wasn't, it wasn't relying on somebody else and I was actually making money and it was

06:36.900 --> 06:37.900
so exciting.

06:37.900 --> 06:44.180
So, I had that whole, whatever, I made a post about it and then I got on the call and I,

06:44.180 --> 06:48.220
you know, I was going to share this training and there was two people on.

06:48.220 --> 06:51.380
And again, guys, you don't have to work on Labor Day.

06:51.380 --> 06:54.340
Some of you guys aren't in that, most of you guys hopefully aren't in that situation but

06:54.340 --> 06:59.340
I think that the rhetorical question I wanted to ask was like, you know, if you're not where

06:59.340 --> 07:03.740
you want to be, should you be taking Labor Day off?

07:03.740 --> 07:09.180
Like if you're not where you want to be, should you be, you know, taking off the Friday, whatever?

07:09.180 --> 07:14.240
And so, I guess rhetorically, I want you guys just to be thinking about this as like either

07:14.240 --> 07:18.180
stop complaining about where you're at or do something about it.

07:18.180 --> 07:22.460
And my dad always used to say this quote to me, if you always do what you've always done,

07:22.460 --> 07:23.460
you always get what you've always got.

07:23.460 --> 07:26.980
And I know it's stupid, it's cliche, and I've heard it a million different times, a million

07:26.980 --> 07:29.620
different ways, but it's so freaking true.

07:29.620 --> 07:30.620
I do the same thing.

07:30.620 --> 07:32.100
We sit and we do the same thing again and again.

07:32.100 --> 07:34.200
We keep coming on these lives.

07:34.200 --> 07:37.340
We keep getting our pencil and our paper and we keep saying, well, I'm going to start that

07:37.340 --> 07:40.780
business but we keep coming up with a reason why we're not going to do it today.

07:40.780 --> 07:44.220
You know, well, we're going to do it once so-and-so graduates.

07:44.220 --> 07:47.900
We're going to do it once, you know, we finish the backyard.

07:47.900 --> 07:50.260
We're going to do it when my job slows down.

07:50.260 --> 07:56.580
You have no idea how many people have almost started this business, have almost done it

07:56.740 --> 07:58.380
and then something happens and they don't.

07:58.380 --> 08:02.060
And I just had a friend recently, he's been telling me over and over, I'm so bored at

08:02.060 --> 08:03.060
my job.

08:03.060 --> 08:07.100
Like, whatever, I don't, it's not, I can make so much more money complaining, complaining,

08:07.100 --> 08:10.580
every single time I see him and I'm like, dude, do this.

08:10.580 --> 08:14.160
And he's like, okay, let me move some money around, let me get into your program, whatever.

08:14.160 --> 08:16.340
He pulls money out of his 401k.

08:16.340 --> 08:18.460
He does the whole deal.

08:18.460 --> 08:22.900
And when it comes down to it, I message him and he's like, it should be deposited on Wednesday.

08:22.900 --> 08:25.900
I'm like, so like, are you joining or like, what's the deal?

08:25.900 --> 08:30.500
He's like, he sent me this long text, something came up and I got to just spend some time

08:30.500 --> 08:31.500
on this person.

08:31.500 --> 08:35.620
And again, it's my friend, but and I didn't say a word back to him because it's my friend

08:35.620 --> 08:37.860
and I just said, hope everything's good, man.

08:37.860 --> 08:38.860
And good luck.

08:38.860 --> 08:40.940
You know, I'm not going to chase you or whatever.

08:40.940 --> 08:43.980
But it was just, it was a reminder that this is how we are as humans.

08:43.980 --> 08:48.860
So rhetorically, I think about this to myself, like I complain that I'm not in a million

08:48.860 --> 08:49.860
dollars a month.

08:49.860 --> 08:53.340
I don't complain, but I said, why am I not a million dollars a month?

08:53.340 --> 08:59.660
And then I'm doing the same stupid stuff that I was doing when I like that I've been doing

08:59.660 --> 09:03.060
and if nothing's going to change and I'm still staying up, like I'll tell you guys, I'll

09:03.060 --> 09:04.060
be honest with you guys.

09:04.060 --> 09:08.780
Last night, you know, my most productive, when I go to bed early on Sunday and I plan

09:08.780 --> 09:13.620
my son on Sunday for my week and I go to bed early, I wake up and I get so much done.

09:13.620 --> 09:15.700
Like I start Monday so strong.

09:15.700 --> 09:19.740
And yesterday I slept in, I didn't plan and I pushed it.

09:19.740 --> 09:20.740
I'll do it later.

09:20.740 --> 09:21.740
I'm going to get some food.

09:21.740 --> 09:23.780
I didn't plan until this morning.

09:23.780 --> 09:24.780
I did plan.

09:24.780 --> 09:26.340
It's not till this morning.

09:26.340 --> 09:28.660
And because of that, I didn't have any momentum.

09:28.660 --> 09:34.120
So last night somebody sent something to me and all of a sudden I'm on x.com on just looking

09:34.120 --> 09:35.120
at these threads.

09:35.120 --> 09:36.940
I didn't go to bed till 3 a.m. last night.

09:36.940 --> 09:38.220
That's so bad.

09:38.220 --> 09:39.220
It's so embarrassing.

09:39.220 --> 09:41.420
And I'm telling you guys because number one, I'm not going to lie to you.

09:41.420 --> 09:44.620
Number two, I do the same stupid stuff you guys do.

09:44.620 --> 09:48.060
And number three, it's like, how can I expect to be at a million dollars a month if I'm

09:48.060 --> 09:52.860
still spending two hours of time that I can't get back?

09:52.860 --> 09:58.220
So painful to say on stupid x.com on meaningless threads that I could have read.

09:58.220 --> 10:00.980
I could have written a book or started a book.

10:00.980 --> 10:02.060
I could have made posts.

10:02.060 --> 10:03.060
I could read content.

10:03.060 --> 10:04.060
I could have slept.

10:04.060 --> 10:05.060
I could have called.

10:05.060 --> 10:06.900
I mean, it was so dumb.

10:06.900 --> 10:12.260
So again, guys, I just wanted you guys to understand it and maybe just to like relay

10:12.260 --> 10:14.500
or to share my frustration.

10:14.500 --> 10:20.060
And what I'm thinking about is if you're not where you want to be, are you doing anything

10:20.060 --> 10:21.060
different than you've been doing?

10:21.060 --> 10:23.540
And if not, then how do you expect anything to change?

10:23.540 --> 10:26.780
It's actually, it's asinine.

10:26.780 --> 10:27.780
Nothing's going to change.

10:27.780 --> 10:30.140
So that's just a little quick thought.

10:30.140 --> 10:34.060
And with that said, guys, I want to get into what we're going to share today.

10:34.060 --> 10:38.140
Now, again, Jason, if you see comments that are pertinent, cut me off.

10:38.140 --> 10:41.580
Aaron, if you need to cut me off, let me know as well.

10:41.580 --> 10:43.060
And then at the end, we're going to do Q&A.

10:43.060 --> 10:44.060
Okay?

10:44.060 --> 10:45.060
How's it going so far, guys?

10:47.060 --> 10:48.060
Going great.

10:48.060 --> 10:49.060
I think it's going pretty good.

10:49.060 --> 10:50.060
Beautiful.

10:50.060 --> 10:51.060
Okay.

10:51.060 --> 10:52.060
So when do you pull the plug on the city?

10:52.060 --> 10:55.660
That's what we're going to talk about today.

10:55.660 --> 11:02.220
My goal, by the way, is that with this specific call, is that by the end of this live, you're

11:02.220 --> 11:06.860
going to have an understanding of my specific criteria for when it's time to pull out of

11:06.860 --> 11:09.140
a city and niche.

11:09.140 --> 11:13.260
But you have to remember that you're only going to perfect this through repetition,

11:13.740 --> 11:14.820
by doing.

11:14.820 --> 11:15.820
And so you can read about it.

11:15.820 --> 11:17.860
You can listen to hundreds of hours of stuff.

11:17.860 --> 11:23.980
But until you go in to an area and you lose some money on ads and you feel what it's like

11:23.980 --> 11:30.140
to see that money going out the door and, oh my gosh, I might get zero return.

11:30.140 --> 11:31.680
Should I pull?

11:31.680 --> 11:36.780
Until you've done that a ton of times, you're not going to be able to perfect this.

11:36.780 --> 11:38.020
And that's just kind of the reality.

11:38.020 --> 11:44.820
So that is my goal with this live, guys, is to have you guys know this criteria doesn't

11:44.820 --> 11:47.060
mean that you have to believe it.

11:47.060 --> 11:51.080
And I don't want you to believe anything that I say without testing it, okay?

11:51.080 --> 11:54.540
So here's the plan, kind of the outline I want to talk about.

11:54.540 --> 12:00.020
Number one is I'm going to talk about how picking the right city and niche is the key.

12:00.020 --> 12:06.020
We're going to be talking about, you know, deciding when to actually pull out is an art,

12:06.020 --> 12:07.940
not a science.

12:07.940 --> 12:11.600
We're going to be talking about if you are actually generating leads, there's always

12:11.600 --> 12:13.140
a deal to be had.

12:13.140 --> 12:17.940
We're going to talk about the fact that you don't lose money until you quit.

12:17.940 --> 12:21.900
We're going to be talking about my criteria for winning areas put on the chopping block

12:21.900 --> 12:27.100
and then my motto in life, but especially in business, okay?

12:27.100 --> 12:28.300
So that said, let's get into it.

12:28.300 --> 12:37.620
Number one, man, I always use like the number 17 or I don't know, something about seven,

12:37.620 --> 12:42.820
I always use some random number for the number of times I've said something.

12:42.820 --> 12:45.740
But guys, I have said this so many times.

12:45.740 --> 12:52.480
The key to every part of this business, the make or break with this business is picking

12:52.480 --> 12:56.220
the right city and niche combo.

12:56.220 --> 13:00.980
If you do not, if you do not pick the right city niche combo, I don't care how good you

13:00.980 --> 13:06.420
are at SEO, I don't care how good you are at ads, I don't care how good you are at sales,

13:06.420 --> 13:12.100
I don't care how quick you can transfer leads, everything is harder.

13:12.100 --> 13:19.100
On the other hand, if you get that right, if you get into a juicy freaking right, low

13:19.100 --> 13:27.340
hanging fruit, you can do almost everything wrong and still win and it feels light and

13:27.340 --> 13:32.180
it feels exciting and it feels, I don't say easy, but it doesn't feel heavy.

13:32.180 --> 13:36.060
And it's like it's motivating because it happened and you did it quickly.

13:36.620 --> 13:42.620
So I just want to stress guys that if you guys are, if you guys do not have the criteria

13:42.620 --> 13:47.180
and you are not confident in what that looks like, you are going to be spinning your wheels

13:47.180 --> 13:51.140
because you're going to, it's going to be hard for you to pull out of a city because

13:51.140 --> 13:54.460
you're going to go, I don't know if that was the right city, maybe I just picked the wrong

13:54.460 --> 13:55.460
city.

13:55.460 --> 13:59.700
But if you know you're in the right city, then you're like, I know this is right because

13:59.700 --> 14:01.220
of this, this, this and this.

14:01.220 --> 14:03.260
It's like these other ones that I was in.

14:03.260 --> 14:08.340
So obviously it's got to be my ads or my landing page or the way that I'm handling these leads

14:08.340 --> 14:10.420
or my cold calling.

14:10.420 --> 14:13.940
But it's so frustrating when you don't know if it's the right city, if you're not getting

14:13.940 --> 14:18.180
leads or you're not having any success to know what the heck is freaking going on.

14:18.180 --> 14:24.020
So really quick, what I want to ask, I'm going to have Jason, this is completely, I didn't

14:24.020 --> 14:27.260
tell you I was going to ask this, but do you want to speak on that a little bit?

14:27.780 --> 14:34.620
Tell these, I mean, maybe, maybe I'm completely in my own field here, but have you seen that

14:34.620 --> 14:35.620
to be true?

14:35.620 --> 14:40.780
Have you seen that, you know, certain areas it's like, dude, I could do a hundred of these

14:40.780 --> 14:44.860
tomorrow and other areas, everything you do, it seems like you just can't move, you know,

14:44.860 --> 14:45.860
can't move the needle.

14:45.860 --> 14:46.860
Yeah, for sure.

14:46.860 --> 14:52.820
And every time I try to go against that, then I end up losing that campaign.

14:52.820 --> 14:55.260
So just stick to what works.

14:55.260 --> 15:00.180
Don't, what is it, what's the, what they say in the South, if it ain't broke, don't fix

15:00.180 --> 15:01.180
it.

15:01.180 --> 15:05.620
I've heard that about a thousand times over the course of my door-to-door sales days and

15:05.620 --> 15:07.620
it is so freaking true.

15:07.620 --> 15:09.820
Okay, now next question.

15:09.820 --> 15:11.580
How do I get the perfect framework?

15:11.580 --> 15:15.500
Well, you can go develop your own or you can pay to get mine.

15:15.500 --> 15:16.500
It's really easy.

15:16.500 --> 15:17.500
Okay.

15:17.500 --> 15:21.460
There's one that, there's 1.8 thousand YouTube videos you could go watch.

15:21.460 --> 15:22.460
And how many live?

15:23.100 --> 15:26.260
Aaron, how many lives do you think we've done inside the free group before we stopped doing

15:26.260 --> 15:27.260
them in the free group?

15:27.260 --> 15:29.820
It was like a solid three years straight.

15:29.820 --> 15:34.980
So like every week, I think I missed two and I was, I was literally in a jungle in Africa

15:34.980 --> 15:38.460
and physically couldn't get on and I didn't plan well.

15:38.460 --> 15:44.260
Uh, there, there's probably a hundred, there's gotta be 150 of those things, right?

15:44.260 --> 15:45.260
Cause I did it.

15:45.260 --> 15:46.260
Yeah.

15:46.260 --> 15:52.420
Three, like now maybe like 125, 130, 130 times, there's 130 times an hour and 15 minutes

15:53.380 --> 15:54.380
I mean, do the math.

15:54.380 --> 15:55.380
Plus all the posts.

15:55.380 --> 15:58.540
So you either pay with your time or you pay with your money.

15:58.540 --> 15:59.540
That's it.

15:59.540 --> 16:01.460
There's no, you pay the piper.

16:01.460 --> 16:02.780
That's how you get the perfect formula.

16:02.780 --> 16:04.020
So I have it.

16:04.020 --> 16:05.180
You want to buy it.

16:05.180 --> 16:08.380
If you don't, you can go through all the material.

16:08.380 --> 16:10.340
If you think that I know what I'm talking about.

16:10.340 --> 16:11.340
Okay.

16:11.340 --> 16:12.340
That's really simple.

16:12.340 --> 16:15.940
Um, the other option is you go and just do what I did, but you guys have to remember,

16:15.940 --> 16:20.740
even though I did all that I did, I spent four hours, four years, sorry, developing

16:21.140 --> 16:25.140
and trying and testing the perfect due diligence formula.

16:25.140 --> 16:32.180
What I think people forget is I also paid, I bought over $23,000 in programs on top of

16:32.180 --> 16:35.780
the four years, four years.

16:35.780 --> 16:40.060
So the fact that some people like, I'm just going to go, I'm just going to go, I'm at

16:40.060 --> 16:41.260
the perfect formula.

16:41.260 --> 16:44.100
That's like thinking that you're going to be like some of these investing companies

16:44.100 --> 16:49.820
that look at a 500 deals a week and know exactly what metrics and exactly what the market should

16:49.820 --> 16:56.340
look like and exactly, um, what the, uh, what the cap rate needs to be, the minimum cap

16:56.340 --> 17:01.540
rate and the growth of the city and thinking that you're even going to play ball.

17:01.540 --> 17:02.540
Absolutely not.

17:02.540 --> 17:03.540
Okay.

17:03.540 --> 17:06.420
So anyway, I just have to stress to you the importance of picking the right city in the

17:06.420 --> 17:07.420
niche.

17:07.420 --> 17:09.740
Cause you guys, I'm going to tell you all this stuff, but if you're in the wrong city,

17:09.740 --> 17:11.620
it doesn't matter what you do.

17:11.620 --> 17:12.620
You're screwed.

17:12.620 --> 17:13.620
Okay.

17:13.620 --> 17:14.620
So that's all I want to say.

17:14.620 --> 17:18.060
Um, also I want to give you a little pro tip and I know I've talked about this before,

17:18.060 --> 17:21.500
but I saw some of you guys said you were new, uh, in the comments.

17:21.500 --> 17:26.060
If you aren't looking at CPC, which for the brand, brand, brand new people, that is the

17:26.060 --> 17:31.260
cost per click, the cost that it costs you to go to Google and say, put me on page one

17:31.260 --> 17:36.180
and I'll pay every time someone clicks on my ad instead of waiting for him to rank.

17:36.180 --> 17:42.180
If you're not looking at the cost, the CPC guys, if you're not factoring that into your

17:42.180 --> 17:45.620
decision of going into an area, that's your business.

17:45.620 --> 17:46.620
Okay.

17:46.740 --> 17:50.660
I've never been advised this from any other course and I've bought a lot.

17:50.660 --> 17:53.500
I've been, I'm in all of them, all the ones that you guys have heard of.

17:53.500 --> 17:54.500
I bought them all.

17:54.500 --> 17:56.900
I'm in, I'm in friends with most of them.

17:56.900 --> 17:59.380
Um, the ones I'm not, they don't like me.

17:59.380 --> 18:00.380
That's fine.

18:00.380 --> 18:04.620
But if you're not looking at CPC, then that's your business, but you should be.

18:04.620 --> 18:05.620
Okay.

18:05.620 --> 18:08.500
Even if you're not going to run ads, you should be looking at CPC and I don't have time to

18:08.500 --> 18:11.500
explain all that, but that is just a pro tip.

18:11.500 --> 18:12.500
Okay.

18:12.500 --> 18:15.500
Next, this is an art, not a science.

18:15.500 --> 18:16.500
Okay.

18:16.500 --> 18:19.060
I, I've tried to make this as scientific as possible.

18:19.060 --> 18:25.220
I've tried my best with, you know, okay, when do we pull out of an area?

18:25.220 --> 18:30.500
Because guys, when I, in 2020, when we went from eight to $10,000 up to a hundred thousand

18:30.500 --> 18:34.060
dollars a month in an eight month window, we were running campaigns.

18:34.060 --> 18:35.820
We were spending money on ads.

18:35.820 --> 18:41.020
We were hustling and bustling and shuffling and we had how many in the queue and how many

18:41.020 --> 18:45.180
getting set up and we, I knew to the second, it was like, I think it was like four minutes

18:45.180 --> 18:47.300
and 32 seconds or five minutes and 32 seconds.

18:47.300 --> 18:51.940
I could set up an ad and it was exactly the same copy and paste the keyword.

18:51.940 --> 18:57.300
I knew exactly what I was doing to, to a freaking team.

18:57.300 --> 19:05.700
And even then, even then I was always surprised here and there, even knowing every single

19:05.700 --> 19:07.380
factor that I did.

19:07.380 --> 19:11.620
I want you guys to understand that this is an art, not a science.

19:11.620 --> 19:12.620
Okay.

19:13.500 --> 19:17.220
When you spend X amount, then you pull out.

19:17.220 --> 19:21.900
But the problem is, is it's like, well, maybe you spent X amount of dollars on ads in the

19:21.900 --> 19:26.500
wrong city or in the right city, but the wrong time of year, or in the wrong right city and

19:26.500 --> 19:33.540
the right time of year, but you didn't do the right ad, like there's so many factors

19:33.540 --> 19:35.420
that you just have to understand.

19:35.420 --> 19:39.660
This is an art, not a science and instead of being frustrated by that, I think you should

19:39.700 --> 19:46.060
be excited by that because this is how I always think about things that are hard or that take

19:46.060 --> 19:52.260
time and effort and thought and creativity and whatever.

19:52.260 --> 19:56.420
Like when Google comes out with a GMB update, everyone's like, oh my gosh, I get excited

19:56.420 --> 19:57.420
about it.

19:57.420 --> 20:02.540
And I don't want to try and, I don't want this to sound like I'm regurgitating information

20:02.540 --> 20:08.100
that people are saying online, but if you really think about it, if it's hard, it's

20:08.100 --> 20:11.860
just pushing people away that aren't willing to go through it.

20:11.860 --> 20:16.060
And so the fact that this is an art and a lot of this business is an art, there's a

20:16.060 --> 20:20.040
reason we call the Facebook group the art of digital real estate.

20:20.040 --> 20:24.140
And we call it the art of pre-selling is because no one wants an art.

20:24.140 --> 20:28.980
Everyone wants to have an exact, perfect, when this happens, then do this.

20:28.980 --> 20:31.020
Guys, that's just not life.

20:31.020 --> 20:34.580
And if you need those answers and you want to live a life that's like, if this happens

20:35.580 --> 20:40.860
then you're more going to be more comfortable, more secure in a nine to five type of a setting.

20:40.860 --> 20:44.500
And I don't mean that in any disrespectful way because that's okay.

20:44.500 --> 20:46.640
But this might not be for you.

20:46.640 --> 20:48.700
This is an art, not a science.

20:48.700 --> 20:53.040
And it's just like with stock market, guys, there's no exact science for how long you

20:53.040 --> 20:54.700
should stay in a stock.

20:54.700 --> 20:59.340
Guys, I invested in 2014.

20:59.340 --> 21:07.140
I worked the entire summer door to door sales, sweat buckets of sweat, got rejected thousands

21:07.140 --> 21:12.740
of times, all kinds of different stuff, lost sleep, got in fights with my wife because

21:12.740 --> 21:15.660
of this, that and the rest and how tired I was, whatever, right?

21:15.660 --> 21:20.420
Missed time with my kids, spent that entire summer doing door to door sales.

21:20.420 --> 21:22.100
And Jason did some of that as well.

21:22.100 --> 21:23.100
So he knows my pain.

21:23.100 --> 21:24.780
Some of you guys might have as well.

21:24.780 --> 21:30.700
And I made that year, I think it was $130,000, okay, basically.

21:30.700 --> 21:31.700
That's gross.

21:31.700 --> 21:33.020
And I think I probably put like one 10 in my pocket.

21:33.020 --> 21:36.180
Didn't have a ton of expenses, but I did have some.

21:36.180 --> 21:44.340
And I spent of that, I spent, I put 40 or 50, I think it was 50, no, it was 50, not

21:44.340 --> 21:45.340
40.

21:45.340 --> 21:46.340
$50,000.

21:46.340 --> 21:47.340
So I lived on part of it.

21:47.340 --> 21:49.800
Keep in mind, I lived on part of it.

21:49.800 --> 21:56.080
And then I spent the majority of the money I had left and I put it on a stock, on one

21:56.080 --> 21:57.440
stock that was going to IPO.

21:57.440 --> 22:01.660
And it was the company I worked for, Vivint, it's called Vivint Solar.

22:01.660 --> 22:07.600
And Vivint Solar, just before that, Alibaba had, if you guys are familiar with that, it's

22:07.600 --> 22:11.240
like the Chinese Amazon, they had gone public.

22:11.240 --> 22:13.960
And literally, I don't know, their stock like 13X or something.

22:13.960 --> 22:14.960
And I started doing the math.

22:14.960 --> 22:19.160
I was like, yo, if I put in 10,000 bucks in this team, 13Xs.

22:19.160 --> 22:27.040
And if it does half of that, then that six, how can I lose?

22:27.040 --> 22:32.720
And to be fair, our bosses, our regional managers, they were telling all of us, get all the money

22:32.720 --> 22:36.480
you can get, put your entire back end of check into this company.

22:36.480 --> 22:38.880
If you got to go to your dad and borrow money.

22:38.880 --> 22:45.240
Anyway, I put $50,000 in the stock and this thing, I put it in and not only did it not

22:45.400 --> 22:51.020
go up, it literally the day after it was down, it would have been better for me to buy in

22:51.020 --> 22:52.760
at the regular price.

22:52.760 --> 23:00.080
And for the entire time, guys, that I was in the stock, I was losing the money.

23:00.080 --> 23:04.000
But the crappy part is, I didn't know when to pull out.

23:04.000 --> 23:07.960
I didn't know if I should keep it in, whatever.

23:07.960 --> 23:10.840
And I pulled out, this is so, it's embarrassing.

23:10.840 --> 23:16.760
I pulled out at the beginning of 2020 and it was, instead of being worth 50,000, which

23:16.760 --> 23:21.020
it had gone down to being worth about 10, it had bumped up to like 25.

23:21.020 --> 23:26.720
So I swelled up a bit and I was like, dude, I'm going to take half my money and just get

23:26.720 --> 23:27.720
out of this thing.

23:27.720 --> 23:28.720
And I did.

23:28.720 --> 23:31.400
I cashed out and I promised you guys like two months later, that thing was not only

23:31.400 --> 23:36.520
worth what I originally bought in, but it was worth like 50% more.

23:36.520 --> 23:41.120
If I would have waited two more months, I waited six years.

23:41.120 --> 23:45.600
And if I would have waited six years and two months, I would have made money, like enough

23:45.600 --> 23:50.360
that it would have been worth my money being in there the entire time, okay?

23:50.360 --> 23:52.940
My point being, that's an art.

23:52.940 --> 23:54.260
This is an art.

23:54.260 --> 23:56.640
Some of the best things in life are art.

23:56.640 --> 23:57.640
Life is art.

23:57.640 --> 23:59.560
And you just got to get comfortable with that, okay?

23:59.560 --> 24:00.560
All right.

24:00.560 --> 24:05.760
Number three thing I want to say, if you guys are generating leads in an area, if you have

24:05.760 --> 24:13.000
a website that's organically getting leads from the GMB, from the organic rankings, from

24:13.000 --> 24:20.160
whatever it is, if you are getting leads, there is always a deal to be made.

24:20.160 --> 24:25.000
If you're running ads and that ad campaign and that landing page is producing consistent

24:25.000 --> 24:30.600
leads, there is always a deal to be had.

24:30.600 --> 24:36.840
And in the same way that my stock, with my stock example, you do not lose money until

24:36.840 --> 24:38.880
you pull out.

24:38.880 --> 24:40.640
You do not lose money until you quit.

24:40.640 --> 24:44.560
And what I mean by that is, let's say in a hypothetical situation that Aaron goes and

24:44.560 --> 24:49.160
sets up a campaign for minneapolisconcrete.com.

24:49.160 --> 24:52.360
And Aaron, he spends 150 bucks, right?

24:52.360 --> 24:53.360
And he has no business owner.

24:53.360 --> 24:54.360
He's gotten some leads.

24:54.360 --> 24:56.020
He's hooked a couple of business owners.

24:56.020 --> 24:57.560
He's tried to get on the Zoom with two of them.

24:57.560 --> 24:59.460
He's 0 for 2.

24:59.460 --> 25:02.100
Or maybe he's only, he's 0 for 1.

25:02.100 --> 25:07.020
If Aaron quits and he's like, dude, this doesn't work, Nick's full of crap, digital real estate

25:07.020 --> 25:11.820
is a baloney, I'm going to do drop shipping, I'm going to do freaking e-com, whatever,

25:11.820 --> 25:14.120
I'm going to go to my 95, that's fine.

25:14.120 --> 25:16.440
That is the only way that Aaron could lose money.

25:16.440 --> 25:20.740
Because Aaron, let's say he's at $250 spent, he has no deal.

25:20.740 --> 25:22.540
But he's like, dude, I'm going to double down.

25:22.540 --> 25:24.440
This area is producing leads.

25:24.440 --> 25:26.540
I know I'm going to get a business owner.

25:26.540 --> 25:27.540
I just got to get creative.

25:27.620 --> 25:29.460
I just got, it's just that next one.

25:29.460 --> 25:30.460
And he spends $500.

25:30.460 --> 25:32.780
He doubles his spend, okay?

25:32.780 --> 25:35.980
But on the last person, he gets the deal.

25:35.980 --> 25:39.080
It's $1,500 a month or even $1,000 a month.

25:39.080 --> 25:41.060
He gets the deal, signs a six-month contract.

25:41.060 --> 25:42.060
Guess what?

25:42.060 --> 25:49.400
Every single dollar that he spent to get to that deal, he recouped instantly.

25:49.400 --> 25:50.940
And he's positive.

25:50.940 --> 25:53.100
And that doesn't mean he had to stay in Minneapolis.

25:53.100 --> 25:55.820
That could mean he was in Minneapolis.

25:55.820 --> 25:57.700
He determined, yes, indeed, this is too competitive.

25:57.700 --> 25:58.700
I didn't listen to Nick.

25:58.700 --> 25:59.980
The CPC was too high.

25:59.980 --> 26:06.460
I'm going to shift to a smaller city in Minnesota or I'm going to shift states because this

26:06.460 --> 26:07.460
isn't a great state.

26:07.460 --> 26:09.900
I'm going to go to Tampa and I'm going to set it up.

26:09.900 --> 26:11.700
And he spends $250 in Tampa.

26:11.700 --> 26:17.620
As long as he doesn't decide to quit and he keeps doing it until he gets that first deal,

26:17.620 --> 26:18.620
he doesn't lose his money.

26:18.620 --> 26:19.620
Okay?

26:19.620 --> 26:25.680
And the way I view it, guys, is you're spending money that you're spending the customer's

26:25.680 --> 26:26.680
money.

26:26.680 --> 26:27.680
Right?

26:27.680 --> 26:33.000
Every time I turn on ads, I'm spending my customer that's about to sign with me is the

26:33.000 --> 26:35.320
way I do it.

26:35.320 --> 26:36.320
Why?

26:36.320 --> 26:39.040
Because I'm not stopping until I get a deal.

26:39.040 --> 26:40.600
Guys, I'll spend $1,000.

26:40.600 --> 26:44.320
I'll go 0 for 20 because I know eventually I'm going to get a deal.

26:44.320 --> 26:47.320
And even if I spend, by the way, I don't think I've ever spent $1,000.

26:47.320 --> 26:49.360
I think the most I've ever spent is a couple hundred.

26:49.360 --> 26:51.000
But I'm just using an extreme example.

26:51.000 --> 26:57.080
I'll spend $1,000 because I know that even if I do get the deal, month one, I break even

26:57.080 --> 26:58.800
and now I'm making money.

26:58.800 --> 26:59.800
Okay?

26:59.800 --> 27:03.240
So you guys have to remember that you get in and you start putting a little bit of money

27:03.240 --> 27:06.560
on a credit card and you're like, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, I'm losing money.

27:06.560 --> 27:08.920
No, you don't lose money until you quit.

27:08.920 --> 27:09.920
Okay?

27:09.920 --> 27:11.320
You don't lose money until you walk away.

27:11.320 --> 27:14.800
Just like I wouldn't have lost that money until I pulled out.

27:14.800 --> 27:18.460
If I would have waited until it, hey, just fix your head, dude.

27:18.460 --> 27:20.520
It's got to come back up or you're leaving it in.

27:20.520 --> 27:21.520
I would have made money.

27:21.520 --> 27:22.520
Okay?

27:22.520 --> 27:23.520
So that's the deal.

27:23.520 --> 27:24.520
Okay.

27:24.520 --> 27:26.240
So now we're going to get into the juicy stuff.

27:26.240 --> 27:30.760
We're going to talk about my criteria for winning areas, put on the chopping block.

27:30.760 --> 27:35.640
But what I'm going to do really, really quick, Jason, do we have any comments?

27:35.640 --> 27:36.640
We don't have any comments yet.

27:36.640 --> 27:37.640
Nope.

27:37.640 --> 27:38.640
Okay.

27:38.640 --> 27:42.280
So what I'm going to do, just one, give me, I just have to plug my computer in.

27:42.280 --> 27:43.280
I'm at a nice 2%.

27:43.280 --> 27:44.280
Hold on.

27:44.280 --> 27:46.280
It's going to kick off one of my lights.

27:46.280 --> 27:47.280
My bad.

27:47.280 --> 27:48.280
Hold on.

27:49.280 --> 27:54.600
Just a thought on why Nick has been saying this.

27:54.600 --> 27:58.360
What he's saying is it's so important to actually find the right business owner.

27:58.360 --> 28:03.600
So he's willing to spend extra money to find the right business owner and not just take

28:03.600 --> 28:09.960
the first person who's going to pay him.

28:09.960 --> 28:11.000
Very good point.

28:11.000 --> 28:12.000
Very good point.

28:12.000 --> 28:16.400
Just because you can get money, just because someone's willing to give you money doesn't

28:16.400 --> 28:19.000
mean you should take it.

28:19.000 --> 28:22.760
And I say this, this is just like, just because something's free doesn't mean you should accept

28:22.760 --> 28:24.760
it.

28:24.760 --> 28:28.720
Specifically inside the free group, when I see people, we try to get rid of all the clowns,

28:28.720 --> 28:31.720
but like I see people like, oh, I have this genius landing page.

28:31.720 --> 28:32.720
DM me.

28:32.720 --> 28:36.720
It's like, bro, do you even make money?

28:36.720 --> 28:38.200
And I call these people out.

28:38.200 --> 28:39.200
I don't know.

28:39.200 --> 28:40.200
Was it Aaron?

28:40.200 --> 28:44.080
Were you on that thread with that kid that was like going ballistic on me because I called

28:44.080 --> 28:45.080
him out on the group?

28:45.320 --> 28:46.320
Was that you or that Kyle?

28:46.320 --> 28:49.320
Must have been Kyle.

28:49.320 --> 28:50.320
Okay.

28:50.320 --> 28:55.360
Anyway, some kid, he did something like that and I called him out publicly and then he's

28:55.360 --> 28:56.360
like, you're being a dick.

28:56.360 --> 28:58.680
I'm like, don't come in my group.

28:58.680 --> 28:59.680
Says right there.

28:59.680 --> 29:00.680
Don't be a dick.

29:00.680 --> 29:05.760
Anyway, let's talk about my criteria for when I put an area on the chopping block.

29:05.760 --> 29:07.140
Again, guys, this is me.

29:07.140 --> 29:09.600
This is my criteria.

29:09.600 --> 29:10.600
What do I know?

29:10.600 --> 29:11.680
Well, I know that real quick.

29:11.680 --> 29:12.680
I know how to make.

29:12.680 --> 29:13.680
Sorry, bro.

29:13.680 --> 29:19.920
I was just going to say real quick, the audio is fine, but the video is really lagging choppy.

29:19.920 --> 29:23.840
Just on a side note, you know, you know what, I don't know if that's what I think it is.

29:23.840 --> 29:25.840
I think it's what I'm charging.

29:25.840 --> 29:29.480
I just kind of said again, pretty rough.

29:29.480 --> 29:30.840
How's the audio now?

29:30.840 --> 29:33.160
What if I just turn the camera off for a second?

29:33.160 --> 29:34.160
How's the audio?

29:34.160 --> 29:35.160
Fine.

29:35.160 --> 29:36.160
Yeah, it's fine.

29:36.160 --> 29:40.680
You know, I think it's I think it's when I plug in my computer to charge it at the same

29:40.680 --> 29:41.680
time.

29:41.680 --> 29:42.680
We're just going to go with the camera off for a second.

29:43.160 --> 29:44.160
Everyone can hear me.

29:45.680 --> 29:48.360
OK, so, yeah, my computer is at two percent.

29:48.360 --> 29:49.360
Otherwise, I do.

29:49.360 --> 29:52.920
It's got to be some weird thing with because I got like a power converter and just all

29:52.920 --> 29:53.920
kinds of stuff going on.

29:53.920 --> 29:54.920
I got it's quite a mess here.

29:54.920 --> 29:57.920
I'm going to start a fire in my in my apartment.

29:57.920 --> 29:59.560
So guys, let's talk about my criteria.

29:59.560 --> 30:03.000
What I was about to say, though, is I was saying, you know, these are my criteria.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
What do I know?

30:04.000 --> 30:07.120
And I was going to say, I know how to make a million dollars a year doing this.

30:07.120 --> 30:08.640
So that could be important.

30:08.640 --> 30:09.640
So here's my criteria.

30:10.280 --> 30:13.680
I've got a couple criteria, but I think you guys are going to be a little bit surprised

30:13.680 --> 30:14.680
by this.

30:14.680 --> 30:19.640
OK, so and again, we didn't even announce this at the beginning.

30:19.640 --> 30:25.120
But what we're going to do is, well, I think we've already created this, Aaron.

30:25.120 --> 30:29.840
I don't know if you've included this in it, but typically what we do on these calls is

30:29.840 --> 30:34.280
if you stay till the end with your camera on, we're going to screenshot everybody here

30:35.240 --> 30:41.280
And we're going to send you the digital resource that we've created from this training.

30:41.280 --> 30:45.800
So but just in case this wasn't put, I would I would write these things down.

30:45.800 --> 30:49.720
OK, I just create that link, a Google Drive link.

30:49.720 --> 30:51.480
So I'll drop it in the comments at the end of the column.

30:51.480 --> 30:53.880
People can just download the PDF.

30:53.880 --> 30:55.080
That's amazing. That's amazing.

30:55.080 --> 31:00.040
And also, I think what we are going to do, too, is anyone that stays on, we were going

31:00.280 --> 31:07.880
to do the the we were going to give them the early access to the next podcast episode,

31:07.880 --> 31:10.160
which is going to is going to drop on Thursday.

31:10.160 --> 31:13.920
So Aaron, if you want to grab that Vimeo link, make it unlisted.

31:13.920 --> 31:15.960
We can drop that at the end as well.

31:15.960 --> 31:17.160
Sounds good.

31:17.160 --> 31:20.800
So if you guys stay till the end, I don't even know what how many of you have on 10,

31:20.800 --> 31:24.640
15, 5, I see 21, including us.

31:24.640 --> 31:25.640
How many?

31:25.640 --> 31:28.160
21, including us.

31:28.640 --> 31:31.600
Beautiful. OK, so there's 18 people, basically.

31:31.600 --> 31:32.440
You guys stay to the end.

31:32.440 --> 31:36.040
We're going to give you guys the digital resource and early access, three days early

31:36.040 --> 31:41.720
access to the latest podcast, which what was the name of the latest podcast we did?

31:41.720 --> 31:48.280
It was the oh, the perfectly the the the perfectly broken business model.

31:48.280 --> 31:49.200
I think it was titles like that.

31:49.200 --> 31:52.840
It's just recorded like two days ago.

31:52.840 --> 31:54.840
So, guys, here's my criteria.

31:54.840 --> 31:57.240
These are things I would consider writing down.

31:57.240 --> 32:03.720
And this is when when these things happen, this puts the area on a chopping block for me.

32:03.720 --> 32:13.240
OK, number one is I have spent at least one hundred and fifty to two hundred dollars on ads.

32:13.240 --> 32:16.960
I've made adjustments to the ads.

32:16.960 --> 32:22.200
And or the landing page, and I'm still not generating leads.

32:22.200 --> 32:26.760
So I go, I spend 50 bucks, I got nothing, I'm still going.

32:26.760 --> 32:28.720
I spent 100 bucks, I got nothing, I'm still going.

32:28.720 --> 32:33.080
Even if I spent 150 bucks, if I see that there's a lot of impressions and whatever,

32:33.080 --> 32:37.120
and it just looks like there's going to be there should be, you know,

32:37.120 --> 32:39.720
like logically, there should be leads in that area.

32:39.720 --> 32:41.440
I know there's volume.

32:41.440 --> 32:43.560
So there's something that's off.

32:43.560 --> 32:46.320
Well, you know, I'm going to keep going.

32:46.320 --> 32:49.760
OK, so if I'm not getting leads and I've spent that kind of money.

32:49.800 --> 32:53.520
And guys, remember.

32:53.520 --> 32:59.080
This is like a totally separate training, but just be logic, be use your intuition.

32:59.080 --> 33:05.080
If you're getting impressions on your ads, that means it's being shown to people.

33:05.080 --> 33:10.000
But if you're getting impressions and you're not getting clicks, your ads either suck

33:10.000 --> 33:14.000
or they're getting shown to the wrong people because no one's clicking on them.

33:14.000 --> 33:19.520
If you're getting clicks, that means you're spending money, but nobody's calling.

33:19.520 --> 33:20.920
You're not getting leads.

33:20.920 --> 33:26.320
That means you're getting clicks from the wrong people, the wrong traffic or your landing page sucks.

33:26.320 --> 33:31.440
And I want to say this because for me, when I say I'll spend 150 to 200 dollars,

33:31.440 --> 33:35.640
I know that my landing page is going to convert because I've just tested it so many times.

33:35.640 --> 33:38.520
I've spent over a million dollars testing it.

33:38.520 --> 33:40.160
I know that it's going to convert.

33:40.160 --> 33:42.200
I know what to what my audience looks like.

33:42.200 --> 33:44.840
So it's very rare for me.

33:44.840 --> 33:48.080
And I also know I've chosen the right area because I know how to choose an area

33:48.080 --> 33:50.120
because I've done it so many times wrong.

33:50.120 --> 33:55.560
But if I spend 150 to 200 bucks and I'm not getting leads, something ain't right.

33:55.560 --> 33:59.720
OK, that's a situation where I would move to a new area.

33:59.720 --> 34:01.320
OK, I ain't quitting. I'm not stopping.

34:01.320 --> 34:04.160
I'm going to keep going, but I'm going to choose a new area.

34:04.160 --> 34:08.800
Maybe I choose a different city that's near there, you know, that kind of thing.

34:08.800 --> 34:12.480
Let's say I'm targeting Vegas or let's say I'm targeting Henderson, Nevada.

34:12.480 --> 34:15.520
That might be a situation where I'm like, all right, I didn't want to target Vegas,

34:15.560 --> 34:20.760
but maybe I need to target Vegas because Henderson's not producing any leads type of a situation.

34:20.760 --> 34:26.120
But 150 to 200 dollars, I've made adjustments to my ads and I'm still not getting leads.

34:26.120 --> 34:29.600
That thing's going on the chopping block and it's getting ready to get plugged.

34:29.600 --> 34:33.720
They're getting ready to get pulled. OK.

34:33.720 --> 34:35.840
OK, that's number one.

34:35.840 --> 34:39.480
Let's see. Number two.

34:39.480 --> 34:42.240
OK, that's it. That's it. That's basically my rule.

34:42.240 --> 34:44.440
These other things, I'm going to go over them.

34:44.440 --> 34:49.440
But like this is what this is the notes that I have outside of that, guys,

34:49.440 --> 34:55.000
outside of me spending 150 to 200 dollars on ads and, you know,

34:55.000 --> 34:58.120
tweaking the leads or tweaking the ads, you know, whatever.

34:58.120 --> 35:00.920
I know I've got the right city because I know my process.

35:00.920 --> 35:03.680
Unless that happens.

35:03.680 --> 35:05.760
I am going to get a deal.

35:05.760 --> 35:08.240
I like I just know and that was one of the things I said at the beginning.

35:08.240 --> 35:10.880
If you are getting leads, there's always a deal to be had.

35:10.880 --> 35:12.720
You might have to, you know, get creative.

35:12.720 --> 35:16.120
You might have to go find somebody on a Facebook Facebook group.

35:16.120 --> 35:18.080
You might have to go find somebody in a neighboring town.

35:18.080 --> 35:20.400
You might have to go find somebody in a different business,

35:20.400 --> 35:23.000
but that also does that service.

35:23.000 --> 35:28.600
OK, you might have to make a post on Facebook and make a post on your story.

35:28.600 --> 35:31.800
There is always a deal. If there are leads coming in,

35:31.800 --> 35:33.960
there is always a deal to be had.

35:33.960 --> 35:37.680
So for me, I ain't pulling out of no area because I can't get a deal.

35:37.680 --> 35:40.400
If there's leads coming in, I am going to go there.

35:40.400 --> 35:44.120
OK, now there is a small caveat because I know sometimes you do something,

35:44.120 --> 35:46.640
you do something, you do something, and it's just like, gosh, dang it.

35:46.640 --> 35:48.440
I need to just take a break.

35:48.440 --> 35:50.960
I'm not if I'm getting leads, that area is mine.

35:50.960 --> 35:52.000
I'm not giving up on it.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.320
There have been occasions where I'm like, all right,

35:54.320 --> 35:55.920
I feel like I pitched everybody.

35:55.920 --> 35:57.640
I need a new set of eyeballs on this.

35:57.640 --> 36:00.200
Let me go ahead and pause this campaign.

36:00.200 --> 36:03.520
I'll set up another one in a neighboring city

36:03.520 --> 36:05.760
or turn on one of my other ones because I've already got one ready.

36:05.760 --> 36:09.080
I'll go and run that, get a deal, and I'll come back to that first one.

36:09.080 --> 36:11.520
OK, maybe I'll wait for a different time of the year.

36:11.520 --> 36:16.200
Maybe I'll wait for, you know, the election to finish or some big news

36:16.200 --> 36:18.760
or tax, but I am not giving up on the area.

36:18.760 --> 36:21.480
I am getting leads in an area with ads, with organic.

36:22.360 --> 36:23.760
I'm going to get a deal.

36:24.760 --> 36:26.600
And that's just the mentality that I have.

36:26.600 --> 36:29.320
So there is there is one rule that I have, and that is that if I've spent

36:29.320 --> 36:32.960
one hundred fifty to two hundred dollars and I know that I'm in the right city,

36:33.320 --> 36:37.280
I have my landing page is good and I'm not getting leads.

36:37.320 --> 36:38.920
Something ain't right.

36:38.920 --> 36:43.720
OK, and and that's the only time I'm pulling out. Period.

36:43.800 --> 36:46.520
OK, so the truth is, guys, is that

36:47.880 --> 36:51.920
if it's if if I'm getting leads, there is always a deal to be had. OK.

36:53.200 --> 36:56.560
That that's it. And if not, guys, if I'm getting no clicks

36:56.560 --> 37:00.080
and only impressions, like I told you guys, if you're only getting impressions,

37:00.280 --> 37:02.800
it's probably getting shown to the wrong people or your ads suck.

37:03.040 --> 37:05.880
And if you're getting clicks, but no leads, then you're probably getting

37:06.160 --> 37:09.320
the wrong people clicking on it or your your landing page sucks.

37:09.840 --> 37:13.040
And you just need to start making adjustments. OK, that's it.

37:13.200 --> 37:19.240
So, guys, like for me, if you find the mentality, there is always a deal.

37:19.840 --> 37:20.720
I will always get a deal.

37:20.720 --> 37:22.960
There was one of my first projects.

37:23.200 --> 37:25.720
In fact, my very first one was towing huntsville.com.

37:25.760 --> 37:27.680
I've since sold the website.

37:27.680 --> 37:30.040
I got a deal. I got it's like 700 bucks a month.

37:30.120 --> 37:32.400
And it was like two, three months. They paid me.

37:32.760 --> 37:33.960
They wanted to pay me in a check.

37:33.960 --> 37:36.360
I didn't really know how to do stripe, whatever.

37:36.640 --> 37:38.760
And it was kind of cool to get a check instead of a stripe.

37:38.760 --> 37:41.160
I liked getting them in the mail, which was stupid.

37:41.160 --> 37:42.320
But that's just how it was.

37:42.320 --> 37:43.600
I didn't want to spend three percent.

37:43.600 --> 37:45.360
All that stuff. Two point nine seven or whatever.

37:47.240 --> 37:48.400
Client cancels.

37:48.400 --> 37:50.520
And I had to find somebody else.

37:50.800 --> 37:52.280
And I did find somebody else for a minute.

37:52.280 --> 37:55.600
And then I couldn't after that, I could not for the life of me find someone.

37:55.600 --> 37:58.720
Guys, I went through every single business owner.

37:58.720 --> 38:00.000
I was given every I could.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.480
It's like I couldn't give away leads fast enough.

38:02.480 --> 38:04.320
I was trying everybody and anybody.

38:04.640 --> 38:06.760
And I almost just gave up on this thing.

38:06.760 --> 38:08.960
I was like, dude, I'm getting leads.

38:08.960 --> 38:10.800
Why? Why is no one taking these?

38:10.800 --> 38:12.520
You know, this area just must not be good.

38:13.080 --> 38:19.680
And finally, I I was in this cash crunch and a friend of mine offered.

38:19.680 --> 38:20.920
He's like, do you have any websites you want to sell?

38:20.920 --> 38:22.640
I was like, well, I have this one that's producing a bunch of leads.

38:22.640 --> 38:25.320
He's like, yeah, but if you don't have a client, it's not really valuable to me.

38:25.320 --> 38:26.840
And I was like, yeah, he's right.

38:26.840 --> 38:30.080
So I just I remember it was December of 2019.

38:30.240 --> 38:34.720
The same December of 2019 that I decided to frickin go all in on this

38:34.720 --> 38:37.680
and to stay in this as I went.

38:38.800 --> 38:42.320
And I went into a Facebook group and I just started cold calling people.

38:42.440 --> 38:44.600
I didn't even I didn't give I was so done.

38:44.600 --> 38:47.080
I was if there was a name and a phone number,

38:47.480 --> 38:49.320
I didn't even I didn't even need to know the company name.

38:49.320 --> 38:51.480
And I saw this one comment.

38:51.480 --> 38:52.840
I remember it was a December day.

38:52.840 --> 38:55.720
It was so bloody cold outside, because I just went for a run.

38:55.960 --> 38:59.280
I came inside and I called this number.

38:59.840 --> 39:02.160
And I didn't know the company name, and I just pitched them.

39:02.600 --> 39:06.240
And I ended up frickin closing this guy for 500 bucks a month.

39:06.240 --> 39:08.640
Put him in a six month contract.

39:08.640 --> 39:11.600
And I flipped the site and sold it for nine thousand bucks to a friend of mine,

39:11.600 --> 39:14.840
which, by the way, he's made way more than that.

39:14.840 --> 39:16.480
So it was a win win for everybody.

39:16.480 --> 39:21.280
But the point is, there is always a deal to be had.

39:21.400 --> 39:26.400
OK, if I'm getting leads and I'm not hooking business owners, that's on me.

39:26.440 --> 39:28.560
If you're getting leads and you're not hooking business owners

39:28.680 --> 39:31.280
or closing business owners, that's on you.

39:31.480 --> 39:34.320
If I'm getting leads and hooking business owners, but I'm not closing,

39:34.320 --> 39:36.520
that's on me. OK.

39:36.520 --> 39:39.520
And guys, to just wrap up on that point.

39:41.080 --> 39:44.760
My motto is always either yes.

39:45.840 --> 39:48.640
Or not now, maybe later.

39:49.440 --> 39:52.080
OK, I don't let people tell me no.

39:53.040 --> 39:55.040
Yes, or not now, maybe later.

39:55.040 --> 39:57.120
We've done an entire training on this inside digital landlords.

39:57.160 --> 40:00.320
But if I go if I if I cold call somebody.

40:01.360 --> 40:02.760
I do not let them tell me no.

40:02.760 --> 40:06.120
I have a way that I can I can leave that door open.

40:06.120 --> 40:07.920
I never close doors. I never slam doors.

40:07.920 --> 40:10.000
I never burn bridges. I try my best not to, at least,

40:10.360 --> 40:12.080
because I know that this is a long game.

40:12.080 --> 40:15.480
And guys, if you guys are in this to make legit real money,

40:16.520 --> 40:21.600
do not get knows, do not burn bridges, do not freaking blaze through areas.

40:21.920 --> 40:24.520
Because the people that tell, you know, today

40:25.240 --> 40:29.520
that are going through something tragic or in the middle of a divorce

40:29.520 --> 40:33.920
or in a financial in three years, those same people will surprise you.

40:34.080 --> 40:35.920
They're in a completely different situation,

40:35.920 --> 40:39.080
maybe in a completely different business, and they will buy leads from you.

40:39.160 --> 40:42.680
And I've had this happen not once, not twice, but probably five different times

40:42.680 --> 40:45.120
where today I almost had the deal.

40:45.120 --> 40:48.240
They were interested and they said no, or they they weren't interested today.

40:48.240 --> 40:50.120
And I said, OK, let's talk down the road.

40:50.120 --> 40:52.800
And I followed up three years later or they saw my post

40:52.960 --> 40:55.640
or they reached out to me and said, hey, can I get some leads?

40:55.640 --> 40:57.240
And I got the freaking deal.

40:57.240 --> 41:01.360
So my motto in life in general is I don't I don't take knows, man.

41:01.680 --> 41:03.200
I don't I never take those.

41:03.200 --> 41:05.520
I leave every single door open

41:05.520 --> 41:08.400
because it's either yes or not now, maybe later.

41:08.400 --> 41:09.680
And that's that's the truth.

41:09.680 --> 41:12.200
So, guys, my my criteria for the chopping block.

41:14.240 --> 41:18.880
Is basically unless unless I've spent 150 to 200 bucks,

41:19.360 --> 41:21.760
made some adjustments on ads

41:21.800 --> 41:24.640
and I'm not getting leads and I am getting clicks.

41:26.080 --> 41:27.880
Then I'm I'm in that area.

41:27.880 --> 41:30.080
And why why can I be this confident?

41:30.080 --> 41:32.240
Because I know what a good area looks like.

41:32.240 --> 41:36.040
I know what what it needs to look like.

41:36.040 --> 41:37.800
I know what kind of search volume needs to have.

41:37.800 --> 41:39.800
I know what the CPC needs to be.

41:39.800 --> 41:42.320
I know those things, and that gives me the confidence

41:42.520 --> 41:45.000
to stay in an area until I get a deal.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.240
OK, Jason, let's go through at nine minutes.

41:47.240 --> 41:48.520
Do we have any questions, any comments?

41:48.520 --> 41:50.400
If not, we'll wrap it up.

41:51.160 --> 41:54.120
Yeah, Kirk was just agreeing with the business owners.

41:54.120 --> 41:56.960
He said he's one thousand dollars.

41:57.800 --> 42:00.000
Looks like he's one thousand euros in on ads

42:00.680 --> 42:03.440
for business owners, and he's still in it.

42:03.440 --> 42:06.120
So he says spot on with the business owners.

42:06.680 --> 42:09.120
I didn't validate mine and lost money on all of them.

42:09.720 --> 42:12.600
Be good. He says it would be good to get tips

42:12.600 --> 42:16.120
on validating the business owners.

42:16.120 --> 42:18.440
So Kirk, maybe mean you can just jump on a call, man,

42:18.680 --> 42:21.160
and I can just show you some tips on that.

42:21.160 --> 42:23.440
So just reach out to Donnie Dre after this call.

42:24.360 --> 42:25.000
That's a good idea.

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
And Kirk, you're crazy if you don't take him up on that.

42:28.160 --> 42:29.840
By the way, I appreciate you doing that.

42:29.840 --> 42:32.440
Yeah, that's so just real quick tips on that.

42:34.240 --> 42:37.000
I'd need more context, but don't be afraid

42:37.600 --> 42:39.920
to do a pullback on the initial call.

42:40.120 --> 42:41.200
That's my tip.

42:41.200 --> 42:44.040
I think sometimes we get in, we want to get some free leads.

42:44.040 --> 42:46.040
If I'll give you some free leads, we'll do a call.

42:46.120 --> 42:48.920
And we're so excited that they didn't like yell at us

42:49.160 --> 42:51.640
and we're so excited, they're showing a little bit of interest.

42:52.000 --> 42:54.880
We're like that person in high school that never went on a date.

42:54.880 --> 42:56.760
And then the first person out, they like go bananas

42:56.760 --> 42:57.720
because they show him some attention.

42:57.720 --> 43:00.400
It's pathetic. OK, don't don't do that.

43:00.400 --> 43:04.520
Like at the end of the call, if you're unsure, say that say,

43:05.200 --> 43:07.720
Mr. Business Owner, real quick, I'll give you some free leads.

43:07.760 --> 43:09.560
Like, shoot me straight, man.

43:09.560 --> 43:11.800
Are you just looking for free leads?

43:11.800 --> 43:13.640
Because if you're just looking for free leads, like, let me know.

43:13.640 --> 43:15.400
I'll give you a free or you want to grow your company.

43:16.080 --> 43:18.120
Like, are you going to answer my call when I call you?

43:18.120 --> 43:18.800
Are you going to?

43:18.800 --> 43:20.920
Because I'm trying to I'm trying to run a business here.

43:20.920 --> 43:22.600
I'm going to let you try this for free.

43:22.600 --> 43:26.400
There's no absolutely no strings attached yet.

43:26.960 --> 43:28.080
But I am here to earn your business.

43:28.080 --> 43:29.480
And if you're not interested in talking

43:29.480 --> 43:31.600
and you're just telling me what I want to hear, dude, I'm a big boy.

43:31.880 --> 43:33.960
I'm a big girl. Just tell me right now.

43:33.960 --> 43:35.520
And that terrifies some of you to say that.

43:35.520 --> 43:38.400
But guys, say it, because if they're interested, they're going to go,

43:38.400 --> 43:40.240
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I'm super interested.

43:40.240 --> 43:41.680
Sorry, I'm busy.

43:41.680 --> 43:44.160
Or if they're not, you're going to give them an opportunity to just

43:45.000 --> 43:49.360
freaking walk away and go call somebody else, because that's as Jason said.

43:51.280 --> 43:52.960
The right business owner is so important.

43:52.960 --> 43:54.720
And you guys are going to it's going to happen to you.

43:54.720 --> 43:56.800
You're going to get business owners that give you their money today.

43:57.520 --> 43:59.440
And they're just not the right fit.

43:59.440 --> 44:00.480
And you want to get that money.

44:00.480 --> 44:02.080
You want to take it so bad.

44:02.080 --> 44:04.520
But it's not the right decision, because if you get that deal today,

44:04.520 --> 44:06.200
you're locked in a six month contract with somebody

44:06.200 --> 44:08.200
who's not going to be with you in a year.

44:08.200 --> 44:10.400
And then in six months, you're going to have to get somebody new.

44:10.560 --> 44:11.720
And that might be the time.

44:11.720 --> 44:12.800
It's like winter.

44:12.800 --> 44:15.200
And you have to make these big boy, big girl decisions of

44:15.600 --> 44:18.000
even though I can take money today, it's not the right money.

44:18.000 --> 44:19.040
It's not the long term money.

44:19.040 --> 44:20.280
It's not the big money.

44:20.280 --> 44:23.240
And that's a hard, mature thing that you have to you have to learn.

44:23.240 --> 44:26.800
OK, so anything else?

44:26.800 --> 44:31.120
Um, John Fahm, he shared one of his areas with the CBC.

44:32.280 --> 44:34.600
And then, yeah, so I just recommended that, you know,

44:34.600 --> 44:36.760
if you do find a good area,

44:36.760 --> 44:39.720
I would encourage you to kind of keep it to yourself also,

44:39.800 --> 44:42.840
especially with like sharing it with people publicly.

44:44.840 --> 44:47.840
It's a Jamesville, Wisconsin.

44:47.840 --> 44:50.840
Does he say what what niche concrete?

44:50.840 --> 44:52.800
Yeah, beautiful.

44:52.800 --> 44:54.120
I'm going to text my team right now and get it.

44:54.120 --> 44:56.480
No, I'm just kidding, bro.

44:56.480 --> 44:57.520
But he says he doesn't really mind.

44:57.520 --> 45:00.440
But to be honest, like, I like to keep my areas to myself

45:00.800 --> 45:04.120
just because that area has potential making you money.

45:04.920 --> 45:08.000
So personally, I like to keep my areas to myself.

45:08.320 --> 45:10.680
I don't share with people because people jump on that and try and take it.

45:11.080 --> 45:13.600
A lot of people are lazy about doing their their due diligence.

45:14.760 --> 45:17.000
So just be aware of that.

45:17.000 --> 45:19.040
Yeah, I know that.

45:19.040 --> 45:20.520
I would just pop in real quick.

45:20.520 --> 45:22.400
You said concrete in Wisconsin.

45:22.400 --> 45:25.000
Just the thought that might not be great

45:25.280 --> 45:27.480
because I think it gets pretty cold in Wisconsin.

45:27.720 --> 45:31.240
And so if you are to go there, you might just possibly want to plan

45:31.240 --> 45:34.120
on it being more of a nine months, a year deal,

45:34.560 --> 45:38.760
assuming that concrete business is like practically shut down

45:39.040 --> 45:40.480
during the winter month period.

45:40.480 --> 45:43.120
You can I mean, still, like if you have a deal going like six

45:43.120 --> 45:44.720
to nine months out of the year, that's awesome.

45:44.720 --> 45:47.480
Obviously, even if it's only a thousand bucks a month, I'm just

45:48.280 --> 45:50.600
that's just a thought as well.

45:50.600 --> 45:51.520
It's a good point.

45:51.520 --> 45:53.920
And I think there's a way you could do it for the year,

45:53.920 --> 45:55.560
but you just need to go in with the right intention.

45:55.560 --> 45:58.120
And what I would do, I'd still do a 12 month deal,

45:58.400 --> 46:00.040
but I'd just pitch it really hard.

46:00.040 --> 46:01.920
Like, hey, this is a year thing.

46:01.920 --> 46:03.840
Like, I only sell a year contract.

46:03.840 --> 46:07.320
It is going to be really slow during the year during December.

46:07.560 --> 46:08.960
So I can either do one of two things

46:08.960 --> 46:10.840
and you can make the one thing seem way better than the others.

46:10.840 --> 46:14.160
I can either pause you for three months and charge you, you know,

46:14.680 --> 46:18.480
fifteen hundred bucks a month for the other nine months.

46:18.520 --> 46:21.960
Or we could just do a thousand bucks a month and you pay year round.

46:21.960 --> 46:23.440
And there's a couple of months you're going to be shut down.

46:23.440 --> 46:26.840
So now they have a perceived savings of a couple of thousand bucks.

46:27.040 --> 46:28.440
They stay with you year round.

46:28.440 --> 46:30.320
You've let them know up front that that's going to happen

46:30.320 --> 46:31.560
and that is going to happen.

46:31.600 --> 46:34.600
And they're just going to be somebody else.

46:35.880 --> 46:38.120
So very important point.

46:38.120 --> 46:39.840
Doesn't mean you can't go into these states, guys.

46:39.840 --> 46:41.080
Doesn't mean you can't go to these areas.

46:41.080 --> 46:44.240
But if you can, I would keep looking, looking to something that's,

46:44.400 --> 46:48.560
you know, Wisconsin's probably good for something that's not that's not concrete.

46:48.800 --> 46:54.480
But again, this comes from experience and nothing sucks more.

46:54.840 --> 46:58.240
And as soon as it starts to get cold, people start calling you, hey, bro,

46:58.600 --> 47:00.320
let's go ahead and pause this bad boy.

47:00.320 --> 47:01.400
And you're like, dude, I can't pause.

47:01.400 --> 47:02.440
Well, OK, I'm sorry.

47:02.560 --> 47:03.880
So good point, Aaron.

47:05.160 --> 47:05.520
Awesome.

47:05.520 --> 47:07.320
And I'm just dropping in the chat right now, the link.

47:07.320 --> 47:09.040
I know we're going to be wrapping it up here in a few minutes.

47:09.400 --> 47:14.000
That's just a link to the Google Drive that's housing the PDF

47:14.000 --> 47:16.400
for the cheat sheet for today's live.

47:17.360 --> 47:21.480
And for those of you that are still on, let me put in the Vimeo link

47:21.480 --> 47:24.520
for early access to these podcasts.

47:25.600 --> 47:26.720
So that's kind of cool.

47:26.720 --> 47:29.760
I've never been part of a when people leave review.

47:29.920 --> 47:32.520
Can we see the name of the person that left a review on the podcast?

47:33.840 --> 47:37.560
It depends on what I think you can only leave reviews on Spotify,

47:37.840 --> 47:40.280
but I'm not too sure.

47:40.280 --> 47:43.880
Well, I'll just let you guys know reviews help.

47:43.880 --> 47:44.600
We appreciate it.

47:44.600 --> 47:47.800
If you guys do leave a review, send me a screenshot posted in the group.

47:48.240 --> 47:50.640
I'll try to hook you guys up with some swag on the next live.

47:51.720 --> 47:53.440
Because those things mean a lot to us.

47:53.440 --> 47:55.480
That's only if you like the podcast and you've actually listened.

47:55.480 --> 47:56.200
I don't want you lying.

47:56.200 --> 47:58.240
I don't want you saying it's good if you don't think it's good.

47:58.280 --> 47:59.960
But we really, really appreciate that.

47:59.960 --> 48:02.680
But yeah, that podcast, that that the one you just shared.

48:03.480 --> 48:06.520
Do you guys go to Spotify or Apple type in digital realistic secrets?

48:07.640 --> 48:11.520
That one is not out and it's not going to be released until Thursday

48:12.720 --> 48:16.040
7 a.m. or 5 a.m. or something like that.

48:16.040 --> 48:18.040
Awesome. Yeah, I just I'm editing.

48:18.040 --> 48:19.560
I put in it was from last week's.

48:19.560 --> 48:21.320
Let me put in the other link.

48:21.320 --> 48:22.640
There we go. It's been edited now.

48:22.640 --> 48:24.760
So you can just save that. That's kind of cool.

48:25.920 --> 48:27.120
And get going with that one.

48:27.120 --> 48:30.400
Yeah, it's why the rank and rent digital real estate model is broken.

48:30.640 --> 48:31.960
Not sure where you're going with that, Nick.

48:31.960 --> 48:33.800
But I will definitely give it a listen.

48:33.800 --> 48:35.640
Yeah, it's it's click bait.

48:35.640 --> 48:38.560
But I follow. I actually come through on the click bait for real.

48:38.760 --> 48:40.320
It makes sense when you listen to it.

48:40.320 --> 48:42.640
So any other questions?

48:43.720 --> 48:46.520
So Kirk just says he has a not now.

48:47.200 --> 48:49.320
Pause the ads was thinking of finding a new bio.

48:49.520 --> 48:51.960
He's asking if you should do that, Kirk.

48:52.040 --> 48:54.280
Yeah, go find a new business owner.

48:54.280 --> 48:57.480
You know, if somebody asks you for a lead, you say not now.

48:57.760 --> 49:00.080
Do you think they want to continue work with you down the road?

49:00.080 --> 49:04.200
Probably not. Yeah, so I agree.

49:04.200 --> 49:05.600
And not now.

49:05.600 --> 49:07.280
Again, I've talked about this.

49:07.280 --> 49:09.400
I've trained about this in digital landlords, guys.

49:09.400 --> 49:13.360
We it's we think that it's like we go to a city and it's yes or no.

49:13.400 --> 49:14.960
Right. It's not.

49:14.960 --> 49:17.120
It's yes or not now, maybe later.

49:17.120 --> 49:19.080
And I view it like an entire city like that.

49:19.080 --> 49:23.240
So if I'm looking, if I'm working Las Vegas, I'm working Los Angeles,

49:23.240 --> 49:24.240
which would be terrible to work.

49:24.240 --> 49:26.160
But I'm going to use that in Phoenix. Right.

49:26.160 --> 49:28.840
I might be working those areas and I might find out that like,

49:29.120 --> 49:32.240
you know, dude,

49:32.240 --> 49:35.440
Las Vegas right now, it's just it's a it's a weird time of year.

49:35.440 --> 49:36.880
And I'm just not getting any traction.

49:36.880 --> 49:40.680
And so I'm not going to quit on the area because I've done all the homework.

49:40.680 --> 49:42.480
I know that's a good area.

49:42.480 --> 49:46.560
But I am going to pause it and go look at other stuff

49:47.120 --> 49:50.320
and maybe try to get a deal in L.A., try to get a deal in Phoenix.

49:50.320 --> 49:52.920
Then I'll come back to it and come back with a fresh set of eyes.

49:52.920 --> 49:57.360
Some new confidence, a new maybe another case study, whatever the case is.

50:02.240 --> 50:03.600
Got it. OK.

50:03.600 --> 50:06.360
Nadine says, Nick, I sent a guy leads this morning.

50:06.600 --> 50:08.920
He seems keen. When do I follow up?

50:12.400 --> 50:15.200
Nadine, are you is she in does that name?

50:15.480 --> 50:17.640
Is she in digital landlords or she not?

50:17.640 --> 50:20.120
I can check. It doesn't sound familiar.

50:20.800 --> 50:21.200
You know.

50:22.200 --> 50:23.440
It does sound familiar.

50:23.440 --> 50:25.240
Nadine, are you in digital landlords?

50:25.240 --> 50:27.400
Because if you are, I'm going to just refer you to a module

50:27.400 --> 50:29.760
which will answer every single one of your questions in two seconds.

50:32.920 --> 50:33.760
Well, we'll see what you answer.

50:33.760 --> 50:35.320
Let's see another. Well, I get that.

50:35.320 --> 50:37.240
Yeah, I don't know if you want to answer for the group still.

50:37.240 --> 50:39.560
Just a quick synopsis summary.

50:41.200 --> 50:43.400
So Nadine's not in deal.

50:43.400 --> 50:45.560
Oh, OK. So just in the free group, then.

50:45.560 --> 50:47.440
So a little summary, Nick.

50:47.440 --> 50:50.440
Yeah, you want to, you're saying?

50:50.440 --> 50:51.800
Yeah, you got it. You want to do that?

50:51.800 --> 50:52.960
Yeah, you do it for the group.

50:52.960 --> 50:56.040
Yeah, this would be the last thing that I'll answer, guys, is.

50:58.480 --> 51:01.280
So it's again, it's an art.

51:01.320 --> 51:06.560
It's it's first of all, when you say follow up, this is this is tough, right?

51:06.800 --> 51:10.680
Like we're not talking face to face, but like you mean follow up?

51:10.680 --> 51:11.440
Are you just sending it?

51:11.440 --> 51:13.560
Because I'm I'm live transfer in all my leads.

51:13.560 --> 51:17.640
So like I'm never not following up from the time that I call you.

51:18.280 --> 51:21.040
Dude, I'm I'm freaking me and you are buds.

51:21.040 --> 51:22.560
I'm calling you. I'm texting you.

51:22.560 --> 51:23.360
I'm not being annoying.

51:23.360 --> 51:25.800
I mean, every time I call you, you're going to you're going to salivate.

51:25.800 --> 51:28.320
You know, I got leads, but you're going to be talking to me a lot.

51:28.320 --> 51:30.400
I'm going to be sending you live transfers.

51:30.400 --> 51:32.040
I'm going to be fine. Did you get that one scheduled?

51:32.040 --> 51:34.080
Did you get that one hooked? Hey, can I call you?

51:34.080 --> 51:36.600
Like me and you are like, I'm sending these free jobs.

51:36.600 --> 51:38.360
They're lit. They're they're digital gold.

51:38.360 --> 51:39.800
I'm not just going to send them and forget.

51:39.800 --> 51:43.320
So the answer, if you haven't talked to him, was yesterday.

51:43.840 --> 51:45.280
You're talking to this person.

51:45.280 --> 51:49.520
You're like you are trying to get this deal

51:49.520 --> 51:52.200
from the second you call until the second you close.

51:52.200 --> 51:56.520
So I don't know what you mean when you say how soon to follow up.

51:56.520 --> 51:58.440
Like you don't ever stop following up.

51:58.440 --> 52:00.880
You're in constant contact until you get the deal.

52:01.960 --> 52:04.080
That's the reality. OK.

52:04.080 --> 52:06.560
Now, when to go for the close.

52:06.560 --> 52:08.160
That's another art thing.

52:08.160 --> 52:10.120
We teach that as I did to landlords to a T.

52:10.120 --> 52:14.280
It's it's also something that you learn and it's there's not an exact answer.

52:15.080 --> 52:16.800
But we have some criteria that we follow as well.

52:16.800 --> 52:18.920
So maybe let's answer one more question if there is one.

52:21.880 --> 52:24.080
Are we good? I think we're good.

52:24.080 --> 52:26.560
Beautiful. Guys, thank you for being on the call.

52:26.560 --> 52:27.920
I appreciate you guys being on the call.

52:27.920 --> 52:30.760
I think we had 20 people, 18 people.

52:30.760 --> 52:33.760
And I I really do enjoy doing these.

52:33.760 --> 52:36.920
I don't care, to be honest with you, if there's two.

52:37.080 --> 52:39.040
Last week, it really frustrated me.

52:39.040 --> 52:41.200
There was two people and it was a Labor Day.

52:42.200 --> 52:45.160
So I told the people that were on, I would make sure to hook them up

52:45.160 --> 52:46.520
and we would run it with more people.

52:46.520 --> 52:51.600
But like I love having 18 people that really want to try.

52:51.600 --> 52:54.080
They really want to do this now to speak to a couple of you guys

52:54.080 --> 52:56.880
that I keep seeing your face again and again and again.

52:56.880 --> 53:00.400
I guess I'm going to ask you, like, what's it going to take for something to change?

53:00.400 --> 53:03.160
Right. Like Jason's on this call.

53:03.160 --> 53:05.280
He's at over thirteen thousand dollars a month right now.

53:05.280 --> 53:08.400
He started in January. I've been seeing some of you guys for way longer

53:08.400 --> 53:09.720
than I've known Jason.

53:10.120 --> 53:12.120
And you're still doing nothing.

53:12.120 --> 53:18.240
You're still refusing to to either take your own, you know, your own action,

53:18.240 --> 53:20.440
spend your own money and pay the piper.

53:20.440 --> 53:21.840
But you also don't want to spend money.

53:21.840 --> 53:24.080
So I don't understand what you think.

53:24.080 --> 53:26.320
Like, do you think that you're just going to wake up

53:26.320 --> 53:29.400
and you're just going to get this business dropped to your lap

53:29.400 --> 53:31.720
that's making you, you know, fifteen, twenty thousand bucks a month?

53:31.720 --> 53:33.320
You're not going to have to work. You're not going to have to suffer.

53:33.320 --> 53:34.840
You're not going to spend any money. You don't have to take it.

53:34.840 --> 53:36.280
Like, I just don't get it.

53:36.280 --> 53:38.880
So there's a couple of you I keep seeing you.

53:38.920 --> 53:42.080
And I love you to death. But for the love,

53:42.080 --> 53:43.840
let's go do something with the knowledge.

53:43.840 --> 53:47.000
Let's quit taking notes and let's go do.

53:47.000 --> 53:49.920
Like, if you're going to choose the path, you have two paths to choose.

53:49.920 --> 53:52.560
Go spend your own money or pay me and get in my program.

53:52.560 --> 53:53.760
That's your two paths.

53:53.760 --> 53:56.440
OK, go spend your own money. Do it today.

53:56.440 --> 53:58.280
And it's a win-win for me, because if you spend it today,

53:58.280 --> 54:00.960
you're going to realize that, holy crap, I just spent a thousand bucks.

54:00.960 --> 54:04.160
I could have just, you know, gone into Nick's program.

54:04.160 --> 54:07.040
I could have paid, you know, started getting into it.

54:07.040 --> 54:09.920
Like, and if you don't, then you're going to get all the information.

54:09.920 --> 54:15.320
So whatever it is, guys, just start, just start.

54:15.320 --> 54:16.280
Go spend some money.

54:16.280 --> 54:18.720
And so you actually see that this isn't as easy as you think it is,

54:18.720 --> 54:20.520
but it's also not as complicated as you think it is.

54:20.520 --> 54:23.560
OK, and that's just for the people I keep seeing.

54:23.560 --> 54:24.600
I love you guys showing up.

54:24.600 --> 54:27.960
But like I said at the beginning, if you don't change anything,

54:27.960 --> 54:29.640
nothing's going to change.

54:29.640 --> 54:32.160
OK, so let's stop getting on these calls and doing nothing.

54:32.160 --> 54:33.720
And I'm going to start.

54:33.720 --> 54:35.960
Aaron, do we have a way to tracking who's on these calls?

54:35.960 --> 54:38.800
Do we have any kind of a thing that shows us in the past

54:38.800 --> 54:40.080
who's been on these calls?

54:40.080 --> 54:42.560
I wouldn't know unless we just manually check the live recordings,

54:42.560 --> 54:44.280
which we could do.

54:44.280 --> 54:45.160
And we might do that.

54:45.160 --> 54:46.240
I would love to see.

54:46.240 --> 54:49.360
And I'm going to start being like, you can get on like three.

54:49.360 --> 54:53.400
And then if you don't have a deal, I'm kicking you out of the entire group

54:53.400 --> 54:56.160
and blocking you from anything I ever create,

54:56.160 --> 54:58.840
because that's time, or at least show me you've spent some money on ads.

54:58.840 --> 55:00.120
At least some of you doing something.

55:00.120 --> 55:01.520
You know what I mean?

55:02.640 --> 55:05.400
That's what I think. OK, guys, thanks for being on the call.

55:05.440 --> 55:07.680
It's a beautiful September 9th.

55:07.680 --> 55:09.440
Live in the laptop lifestyle.

55:09.440 --> 55:12.720
We got we got we got people from Aaron.

55:12.720 --> 55:14.200
Tell these guys where you're at.

55:14.200 --> 55:16.160
I'm in Virginia.

55:16.160 --> 55:19.560
No, what city? It's it's it's.

55:19.560 --> 55:22.600
What's it called? Colonial Heights, Colonial Heights.

55:22.600 --> 55:26.560
I'm going to do a couple of projects, digital real estate in that area today.

55:27.760 --> 55:30.200
Just right in Aaron's backyard, just for fun.

55:30.200 --> 55:32.080
Just kidding. Jason is in.

55:32.080 --> 55:35.080
Are you in Lehigh, Jason, Lehigh, Utah?

55:35.120 --> 55:36.320
Southern Utah County.

55:36.320 --> 55:37.920
Basically the same place.

55:37.920 --> 55:39.400
OK, Utah County. OK, beautiful.

55:39.400 --> 55:40.760
And I am in Dubai.

55:40.760 --> 55:42.640
And there's people all over the world.

55:42.640 --> 55:44.800
And guess what? That's the beauty of the laptop lifestyle.

55:44.800 --> 55:46.640
So, guys, thanks for being on the call.

55:46.640 --> 55:48.080
Grab those resources.

55:48.080 --> 55:49.160
We'll see you next week. Thanks, guys.
