00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
How do we determine how a campaign is doing or why is it not doing well?

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:09,600
So on the screen here I brought up this is a this is a good one to look at because this is one where

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:15,920
Nick has a good website that's ranking well and SEO wise it's bringing in enough leads so we've

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,840
we've kind of supplemented with a little bit of ad spend during the colder months

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,040
and so I want to show you what the numbers that we're seeing here so you can kind of get an idea

6
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:30,800
of what to look at so your your the answer to the question is going to be in the data

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,640
so in the data here what I like to do is I like to pull up where my keywords are

8
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:42,880
you can also pull this up in in the ads and the assets I like to look at what keywords are landing

9
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:48,400
where they're landing and you can see here you know this this ad itself has had three total

10
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:52,400
conversions it's had a little bit more than that but we're going to we're going to look at those

11
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:57,120
ones that got they got tagged what they're getting tagged for we're looking at the total

12
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,600
impressions here the big thing I'm looking for here is that am I getting impressions

13
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:08,880
and am I getting a CTR which is the click through rate so in general about five you know four to

14
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:16,320
four to six percent is considered decent and and you're doing a good job above that is is a really

15
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:22,960
good job there's people that make millions of dollars a year selling at two to three percent

16
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:30,080
CTR okay so a lot of it is just about volume but for us for our purposes if you're hitting in the

17
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:35,360
above six percent on the CTR you're probably doing something good the other the other way to

18
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,240
look at this too is another way to look at it is this search impression rate and if you go to

19
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,680
columns if you don't have that on yours you can go to modify columns here you go to the competitive

20
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,880
metrics right here and you'll see that top left search impression share and then you click apply

21
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:58,560
and that brings that column up for you and so if this search if this search impression share is

22
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:04,880
in the higher range or above 50 you're doing really really well and what you can do is you

23
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:10,880
can use that data if I'm not getting the impressions that I want then I need to look at my my daily

24
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:17,760
budget and what I'm bidding cpc wise and that's the first place to look the second place to look

25
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:25,280
is where my CTR is my CTR is in the four percent range then I need to understand why typically

26
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:31,040
that's going to be a budget issue and or possibly an ad copy issue but if your budget looks good and

27
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,080
the cpc looks good if you go back and look at google google keyword planner and and that is

28
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,960
where it needs to be then I would look at my ad copy next and then after that we look at

29
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:47,040
search impression share and that tells us how we're doing to our competitors and then we have

30
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,440
the conversion rate after that the conversion rate I'm not too worried about because most of

31
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,360
you are not setting up the conversion tag so it's something you don't really need to worry about

32
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:02,640
right now but that those are the things that I look at if my impressions are good I have good CTR

33
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:08,880
I'm doing favorable with the search impression share now I start looking at my landing page

34
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:13,200
only then do I start looking at my landing page after I've checked my ad copy is my ad

35
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,080
copyright is my ad copy landing for the search terms that I want for the services I'm providing

36
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,800
and you know there's everything working does the number work on it and all those things

37
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,480
and then you want now you want to go start addressing your landing page issue
