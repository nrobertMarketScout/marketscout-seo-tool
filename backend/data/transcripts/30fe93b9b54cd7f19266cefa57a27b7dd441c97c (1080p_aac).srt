Sala found a city where two people are ranking in GMBs, but not in the organic CPC and search

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:10,800
volume fit the criteria. Should I go for it? So that, that one right there, I would go a little

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:18,240
bit further Sala. So what, what they're saying is they found a city where there's the two people

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,960
that keep ranking over and over in the GMB. So that's kind of a red flag because ideally you

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,880
want it to be mixed up, mixed up, mixed up, but that's, that's fine. But this, but they're also

6
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:33,760
saying that the, in the organic rankings, they're not showing up on page one for those same terms.

7
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,080
That's a good thing, but I would take it a step further and I would go look at those same companies,

8
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,120
sorry, I would go look at the companies that are ranking on page one organically.

9
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:51,360
And let's say the top two competitors and look at their backlinks, how many I would look at maybe

10
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,720
like how much domain authority or how much, what's the other term that we use? Trust flow

11
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:01,840
is the other one. If you use majestic, remember guys, we talked about backlinks like three weeks

12
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,080
in a row. I would look at the quality of the backlinks. I'd also look at the age of the domain

13
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,760
and I would just look at a couple of different factors before I just automatically assume in

14
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,560
this situation though, I would be happy to take a look at it for you Sala. If that would make you

15
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,320
feel better, make sure to message me, Ashley and fix it on a group thread. Great question.
