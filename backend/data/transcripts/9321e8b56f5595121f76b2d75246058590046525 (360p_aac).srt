1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Okay.

2
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,000
No, this is not a drill guys, this is the second live of the day, you are correct.

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Yeah, this is how far we go for you guys are rock star student today is from Australia, so he was gracious enough to jump on and it is right now 7am.

4
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:19,000
In the land down under, so I'm going to have Levi jump on in just a second here and share he is definitely trailblazing over 40 closes over 15 active rank and rank legions this guy has already done enough rinse and repeat.

5
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:36,000
He's definitely an og so let's see here without further ado, let me start the recording and then get Levi in.

6
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Okay.

7
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I can also check the volume and the sound. Can you guys let me know if you can hear me.

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I want to make sure that this new mic is doing its job.

9
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Okay.

10
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Okay, we are live in the right group. Good.

11
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And I can see myself.

12
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Hey Levi.

13
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
How's it going buddy.

14
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Good.

15
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Good. Are you caffeinated.

16
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:28,000
No, I don't drink coffee. Oh wow, you're just get up and go huh. Yeah, this role role.

17
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
All right.

18
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm impressed.

19
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So, for those who don't know you Levi, can you tell everyone.

20
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:45,000
When you got into the space and how it came about, what happened, how did you find yourself in this program.

21
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:57,000
How I found myself in this program I think someone told me about the group. I think I checked it out. And then I found out he's got a paid course and I'll just jumped right into it.

22
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I skipped all the free stuff and just went straight into it.

23
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I just, I don't know if it's me being lazy or I just, I'll value something a lot more if I put money into it, and I see a better return faster, because it's like I have to make this work.

24
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Rather than doing the free stuff, you kind of skim on by and I'm sure there's a lot of guys out there that would just keep skimming on by and they don't actually take that action to get something started.

25
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Back in 2022, this one I joined.

26
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Yeah, it's like, what is the same, nothing wagered nothing gained, like you put your money where your mouth is, and you keep yourself accountable that way if it's just a free course like, you know, take it or leave it but when you're paying for it, you kind of

27
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
make it work to use it.

28
00:03:50,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Yeah, that's a good way to explain it. Yeah, so you jumped on immediately in 2022. And did you start running through the process or did you set it aside and go do something else did you did you dive right in right into it.

29
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I think it was like day 29 or something I got my first deal. And then it was pretty much near like a month after that I think I've got another deal and then a couple months after that I've got another deal and it just kept kind of going from there.

30
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Wow, that's awesome.

31
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Yeah, so you, you definitely don't write in then it took me a while to close a rank and rank deal. I've done so much other stuff when I started.

32
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It took over a year to close anything that has to do with the lead generation or rank and rank so yeah that tells me you really focus like you did not get distracted, and you just hammered that process over and over, rinsed and repeated.

33
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Yeah, so many phone calls, which is good, because that first client is still with me to this day.

34
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Do you care to share the niche.

35
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Oh, really. Yeah, nice. Are you getting volume are you getting enough volume. Yeah, probably.

36
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:23,000
If we go back during like peak season we'll get like 500 leads coming through in one month.

37
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Good Lord. Wow. Yeah, it was up there.

38
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Yeah, you're definitely compensated with the volume.

39
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Yeah, because it is low ticket just like here right like lawn mowing would be, first of all, reoccurring so when you get an account it's like, it keeps paying so that's a good thing.

40
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:55,000
But it is low ticket you're looking at, I don't know, 50 bucks every time they do it or something like that here, I just paid $200 to get my yard mode.

41
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Yep. And yeah, it depends. It depends where you live. So for me I pay $150 for the entire month. Yeah, that is awesome that it is expensive over there so it makes sense and the fact that it would be quite like you're quite periods of during, I guess, winter when nothing grows but then right now where it's raining every couple days, the grass is shooting up and the guys are loving it.

42
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Yep. Oh, I believe it. Yeah, when you have that sun rain sun rain, the grass just goes crazy. We have that here too in Florida.

43
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:46,000
During the summer where you can't keep up with the with the grass anymore. It just goes wild. I love that man so you had this guy this whole time. How does he do when things get scarce like, does he freak out or is he cool with it.

44
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:55,000
We've gone through, like, I don't know if you call it rough patches where he's caught up saying he wants to cancel.

45
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:05,000
And it was just a simple matter of just talking and figuring out what's going on and we're able to work something out came to an agreement whether

46
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'll reduce the payment for a little bit for like, I don't know a month I think I said, but then after that I'm going to increase them. And I think I ended up increasing it, but it's not like a massive paying client like I think it's only like six hundred bucks a month or something.

47
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:35,000
But yeah, I just I increased it pretty much a little bit from there, and I'll probably end up increasing it again soon ish. He understands he sees the value in it now. A lot of his clients aren't even residential just all the commercial jobs that come through.

48
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:46,000
So he's got a couple of the commercial jobs and they're like 3k a month and he only goes there. Maybe once a weekend in a month. And you'll do that. There's got a few of those that come through.

49
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Yeah, I mean, he's definitely getting a great deal with you. Is this all organic?

50
00:07:51,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Yeah, all organic now. Yep. Beautiful. Beautiful. It was my first ever site I ever built ever ranked ever did anything with.

51
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Yeah, that's awesome man.

52
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Yeah, I definitely see you increasing your price with him. You just have to nurture him. You know, every year he's going to get more and more convinced that this is this is what he needs.

53
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:25,000
And I like that he already went through a couple of seasonality cycles. So he knows what the low looks like and what the high looks like.

54
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:34,000
So yeah, once he, you know, puts all his numbers and goes through his numbers and stuff, he'll he will see that there's a return on investment.

55
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:45,000
So yeah, your service definitely makes sense to him, especially with the crazy volume you're getting him. That's a $2,000 a month website.

56
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Yeah, it's just a matter of bringing him up there little by little. Every year you can, you know, you can.

57
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:02,000
As he grows, I'm able to increase the price pretty much as I've gone with anyone, any businesses as they grow that business, I'm able to increase my prices and we can scale it together.

58
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Especially that you get him commercial. That's that's no joke, because if you're paying a couple hundred dollars to to mow a residential, I mean, to mow commercial that's that's a lot more.

59
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:26,000
And if he just does one commercial job a month that covers for your fee, you know, four or five times over. So yeah, I like it, man.

60
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I like it, man. So you've done the lawn mowing and then you you created you had momentum right after that first deal, you stayed on.

61
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Yeah, kept on. I did the whole let's run five different ad campaigns at the same time and burn myself out really quick.

62
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Yeah, I think everyone's kind of done that.

63
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Um, let my lesson really quick, choose through your money really fast when you're not able to pay attention to every single job coming through.

64
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And you kind of start from the wrong foot where I never had any any list built out. So I didn't know who to contact when these jobs came through.

65
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
So I was just all up in the air. That screwed me over a little bit.

66
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:20,000
And eventually, I think at the right timing to I just canceled, I think, four or three other of the ads out of the five, and I only had one or two running.

67
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:28,000
And then from that one or two, I was able to just kind of focus on those two and get a client for that and I was in the concrete niche.

68
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Nice. And concrete niche is good in Australia. Is it like a like a year year round thing?

69
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Everything is yearly, like it's all everything in Australia is all year round. I have yet to find something that's not.

70
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Deck building is probably the only thing that's like a yearly like a that that's seasonal. I think everything else is is all year round. I think yeah decking and pool builds.

71
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I would imagine are the only two things that are seasonal.

72
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:14,000
That's awesome that so Australia is prime for for rank and rent then and because oh yeah you have you guys have the four seasons in one day situation right like you get in rain and sun and so but but it doesn't freeze right.

73
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
No, no, no cold.

74
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Down south, there's a little bit of cold and on some mountain peaks you might get snow but I would say 98% of Australia is not like this. There's no snow. Yeah, my knowledge.

75
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I like that I mean a lot of it is an uninhabited and you know Bush and desert and all that stuff but when you go to a populated area, you can run a rank and rent and run it no issues, no seasonality issues or anything for the most part.

76
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Yeah, I like that and concrete is one of them because concrete takes a beating.

77
00:11:51,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It, you know, it expands and it contracts and the sun the water. So yeah, Australia should be prime for concrete because there's a lot of erosion, concrete erosion going on cracks and all that stuff in Australian weather is a little rough like especially the heat, it gets pretty, pretty crazy right.

78
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Well, I think, what was it yesterday was like, see I don't know what it is in Fahrenheit but it was 31 or 32 degrees Celsius it was 8% or 90% humidity. It was like 42 degrees so I think that's in the 90s, I think, and yeah, yeah.

79
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
What is it 31 centigrade.

80
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Okay, so it feels like 107 Fahrenheit.

81
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Holy smokes.

82
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Yeah, that's an oven. Okay.

83
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I see why it works.

84
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:54,000
That's awesome. What other niches or niches can you share with us that were successful other than lawn mowing and concrete.

85
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Anything and everything really like as long as you give it a go.

86
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I've heard guys get, I'm not in roofing but I know people that have been in roofing.

87
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Deck building.

88
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:17,000
The volumes not there though with deck building sometimes fencing bathroom remodels.

89
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
What else we got I'm trying to think off the top of my head.

90
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Landscapers.

91
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,000
There's a few, I'm pretty just stuck with fencing and concrete, like the other two that I'm in.

92
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Oh, okay, nice. Fencing is good too.

93
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Yeah, yeah.

94
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Fencing and concrete. Okay.

95
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Nice. So, what, how do you see yourself, handling the deals now versus when you started, what, what has changed since

96
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I don't think so.

97
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Same process.

98
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I've probably adjusted a little bit, but nothing crazy like if you compare what Nick teaches and what I do, it's, I'd say it's very similar, you'll be able to compare like apples for apples almost.

99
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Right. So you're not getting creative, you're just sticking to it.

100
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Yeah, I try and keep my basic.

101
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I don't want to overcomplicate stuff but I'd rather keep it nice and simple and just go with that.

102
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Yeah, I have I have complicated things before and it backfired.

103
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I have freestyled the script before I have done the screen recording differently I've done did things differently and sometimes it works and sometimes it backfires.

104
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I do go off script, when I have like an existing client, like we just I just closed one yesterday and they're already. He was already a client of mine we were doing other stuff like other marketing stuff.

105
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:07,000
And then we discovered that we could do rank and rent for them. So that one I didn't go through the entire thing. I just sent them, you know, two or three and they're like yeah this is good.

106
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:17,000
And we have done a call yesterday for like 15 minutes and that was it just a bit more than me, I'll just send him a text message and we just both give each other a thumbs up and go from there.

107
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Really you've done that before you close that way.

108
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Yeah, yeah, we'll just send a text message and just get all right this is what we do. This is how much it costs. Sweet.

109
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Like a friend or family. No, no, just a client that I've probably had for a year now.

110
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Yep. He went from, what was he paying? He was paying like $1,600 a month. Now he's doing paying me $1,000 a week.

111
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Sweet. That's good. That's four grand a month.

112
00:15:51,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I like it. And you, you told me off camera that you are in the, you were in the 40,000s and now that you lost a couple of clients recently, you are in the 30s and the mid 30s. Is that accurate?

113
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Yeah, 25, 30s around there. I would say I'm just kind of waiting to see how it all ends up and go from there.

114
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Yep. That's pretty impressive though. And the fact that you did that in two years, that is, that shows consistency for sure.

115
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Yeah, a lot of those clients will come back on in the new year. It's just personal reasons. I know some had health reasons, but they've hurt their back, they've hurt their foot.

116
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Being as like a, just a, the business being dependent on them, I guess that's like, we call them sole traders. It's hard for them. So obviously with those issues, they've obviously paused, cancelled, I guess over this Christmas period.

117
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,000
And then they said, look, once we're all better, once we're all on top of things, we'll continue on in the new year.

118
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Right. Yeah, you will get a lot of those now because they're trying to save some money, like a couple of weeks.

119
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I've had a couple call up and I just straight up told them that we just continue on through and it's what everyone else is doing. Just continue on through because you're still going to get jobs coming through.

120
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:21,000
The jobs don't stop coming through. We're still getting jobs coming through to this day. Like I've already had emails come through now, like one, two, two couple jobs there just now in the past two minutes, three minutes.

121
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:30,000
So it's not like there's no shortage of work coming through. It's consistently paying. So it's not like you're paying for something and you're getting nothing. You're going to be getting jobs coming through, I would dare say, up to Christmas.

122
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,000
It will stop on Christmas and then continue on after that and then stop on New Year's and then continue after that.

123
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Yeah, I mean, that's a great argument. That's a great way to put it. Like the leads don't stop. Yes, you do want to take a break during Christmas and not pay for a week or two, but or you can just schedule in January and still go to your Christmas party.

124
00:17:53,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Have them there and then contact them when you get back. People are contacting you knowing that you're on holidays. It's not like they don't think you're on holidays. It's just they know that you're busy, you're on holidays, you'll get to them when you get to them.

125
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:14,000
And if you can contact them, you basically by putting yourself out there, you got that opportunity to then contact them later on. Otherwise, you never get that opportunity. If they cancel now, it means they don't get that lead.

126
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:22,000
And now that they're starting off on a bad foot, because now they've got to wait for more leads to come through. Rather than keeping that pipeline full, they empty the pipeline.

127
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Yes, yes. That's a great argument. Yeah, hitting the ground running once January comes and you're like, you're not shutting down and then come January, like waking up like, oh, let's start over.

128
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
So when businesses cancel, they want to pause. I highly suggest not doing it because of the like, you may save like a couple of dollars, but it costs you a lot more in the long run because you go from having a consistent flow of jobs coming through and you'll consistently smash them out. You may not be making great money. You may think, oh, I need to cancel this for a month while I've got a month booked out. But then as soon as that month ends, you're like, fuck, I've got no more jobs.

129
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:18,000
And when you start learning jobs, it's not going to be straight away. There's, I think on average three to six weeks is what it takes to land a client is what I found just based on talking to my clients. That's three to six weeks of no work that they have coming through.

130
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:28,000
And now, now they're, that's a whole month where they're not making any money and they're having to pay me. So it sucks. You'd rather make a little bit than make nothing.

131
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Yeah, that puts it into perspective. Like what you're working on today, you will close in a couple of weeks. You're not just going to start in January and start closing right away. You got to nurture the job. So why not keep the wheel turning, not pause.

132
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:58,000
What I use as an argument also, in addition to that, and you can use this is I tell them, I can't pause Google. I'm not going to pause Google because if I pause it, I'm going to get penalized and I'm going to start over. I've got to season the ad again. I've got to go through all that BS.

133
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:22,000
So I told them, I'm going to have to find someone else. I respect your decision, but I'm going to have to find someone else to pick up slack because I don't want to go through this again. I can't pause the ad. And that's when they realized, oh, okay, this is not up to us. It's we need to stick with this. This is not like a picky choosy, you know, take it or leave it.

134
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I want to use it kind of thing. It's a right. Yeah, we're paying Google top dollar. You're in you need to have some skin in the game. Absolutely. But I like your argument for sure. Because yeah, you can't you don't just pause and then hit the ground running in January like you got to.

135
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:48,000
You got to go through a little bit of tumbling before you before you stand up.

136
00:20:48,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I like it. What is what is the most deals that that you got canceled on like what is what is the worst cancellation streak you had for me it was, I think, three, three in a row in like two weeks.

137
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Probably seven in the past month and a half. Yeah, that one stings man. Yeah, I had to have some hard conversations with some of the clients because and this is every year I think I need to find like a permanent solution is because as soon as Thanksgiving is over, everyone wants to take a break everyone wants to take a nap.

138
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Everyone wants to stop being charged. And the conversation that I always bring is, do you remember, June and July when we were blowing it up.

139
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
You didn't ask you didn't ask to cancel then.

140
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
And I didn't ask you for more money.

141
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,000
When we were doing really well but now that we're trickling one to a week.

142
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I see that you want to cancel.

143
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:13,000
This is not what I had in mind when I said a mutually beneficial relationship. This is not what I had in mind when we talked about a win win situation.

144
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I can't give you all the upside and take all the downside, otherwise I'll be out of business so I do blow it up for you in June and July.

145
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I don't want enough cash to justify going through the slow season.

146
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:35,000
So that's the conversation that I have with them, and a lot of them get it. Actually, a lot of them understand.

147
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:47,000
But I tell the other ones, if you want to cancel on that, I'm not going to hire a lawyer for $4,000 to go up to come after $4,000 that's not what I'm, but I'm what I'm going to do is I'm going to go find someone else.

148
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:57,000
If I go back, I'm probably going to be hooked up with someone else and I don't want you to be in that situation where you need me and I'm already engaged with someone else.

149
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:07,000
And that they get it that way like oh okay so this is like he's not going to pause just because I want to pause he's going to go find someone else, my competitor, I don't want that.

150
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Yeah, or I think any client that's cancelled understands that. Like I said, there's been a couple like from that seven, maybe half will probably sign up again in the new year.

151
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:24,000
So I'm not too stressed about it. Obviously they're off, they're not paying or anything, but they're going to continue on in the new year.

152
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:36,000
The other four or so I think one just called me up saying he's too stressed out from the amount of work, which is to be expected when he's just a solo guy, he hasn't fired anyone.

153
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I always expect it for those guys. I'm the one taking the risk on them. If I do go with them and usually they'll sell me and they're like yeah please like let's do this.

154
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:55,000
When I'm telling them no, I don't think this is going to work out. They're the ones that are like yeah let's do this, let's do this, like I'll work really hard, I'll make this work.

155
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Some get it and it clicks for them and they do really well. Others, it just doesn't click fast enough or they're not able to withstand that pressure of all the stress coming through and I don't sugarcoat any of this shit at all.

156
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I would rather tell them straight up that it's going to stress you out. You're going to feel like the world's going to end and you're probably going to want to quit on this and you end up closing down your business if you do quit on it.

157
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Everyone goes through this feeling, it's just a matter of pushing through it and if you can withstand that push through. If you can't withstand that push through, don't even bother starting too much.

158
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I'd rather you not start, you don't waste either of our time where if you're willing to push through this shit and get through all the crap, all the bullshit, all the headaches, the stress of the clients, the stress of clients not paying your money,

159
00:24:47,000 --> 00:25:01,000
the stress of me coming after you for money, like you having to pay me weekly or monthly or whatever, the stress of just being up late and everything. If you can get through all that on the other side, it's awesome. It's just you got to get through that shit bit to get to the good bit.

160
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Yes, absolutely. Go through the shit bit to get to the good bit. Yes. Let's see, I have another question for you here.

161
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:30,000
To go through that, I'll expand on that. I've had a client that shared with me recently, he was telling me how for a period that he was basically collecting cans, like 10 cent cans and given them and collecting the money for that and that's what he was using to feed his family for a little bit.

162
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Because all his money was invested straight into the business. Wow. Fast forward now that guy's paying me $1,000 a week and he's doing really well. One of the jobs I think he's got is like $2.8 million or something like that. It's like 40 projects that are like 60 grand each.

163
00:25:47,000 --> 00:26:05,000
60 projects that are 40 grand each. Wow. That's crazy. So this guy is like textbook entrepreneur. Yeah, he's done well. It's not his first business. He sold cans to fund the business.

164
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I don't know if you have it in the US or not, but it's like a recycling initiative where you can collect your beer bottle cans and stuff and you give them in. So that's what he was doing just to put some food on the table for his family because all his money was invested in jobs and he didn't have much to do.

165
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Yeah, that's a gangster move right there. Going above and beyond for your business. You mentioned people complaining about too much business like they freak out when there's like too much influx.

166
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I used to not have an answer for that, but I drafted something and I started using it because it is a BS excuse. That's probably the worst excuse I hear is you're sending me too much.

167
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Like that's the point is blowing it up for you as opposed to having really scarce leads. So what I tell them is I don't see a problem. If you can't help them now, schedule them out. If they want to move on and go somewhere else, they can go somewhere else.

168
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:30,000
You can take the ones that make the most sense to you and say no to the ones that you don't and outsource them and that way you're raising your price. You're doing less work and you're raising your prices and making more money.

169
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:43,000
So I don't get that. I don't get the, oh, you're sending me too much. I can't handle it. Yes, you can say no to 40% and say yes to 60% and raise your prices.

170
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:53,000
So yeah, that's what I've been saying to that because it pissed me off and I didn't have an answer until like a year ago or something like that.

171
00:27:53,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I've never had to really say it because a lot of the guys, at least the ones that I've been qualifying correctly and going through the whole process and they just click like some guys just get the whole process and it clicks for them and all they need is more work and that's like the final piece of the puzzle for them.

172
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Other guys need to go through a few more steps to get them to understand but the guys that understand it, they're increasing their prices. They know right now around Christmas time they're increasing their prices for anyone that wants it done ASAP.

173
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Anyone that wants any project done before Christmas, it's going to cost you an extra 20% more if you want to get it done.

174
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Other guys like the guy that pays me $1,000 a week because he's got a couple different locations now. Some of those locations like the newer locations that he's not fully developed in, he's dropped his prices just to get more jobs coming through, books up a team and then he'll increase the prices.

175
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:51,000
The areas where he's already established those prices are probably I'd say 20% more than everyone else because he knows the value of what he's doing.

176
00:28:51,000 --> 00:29:08,000
That's smart. Yeah, I mean that's a smart way to go about it instead of trying to jump on every job that we send and freaking out if you don't get it or whatever. Yeah, whatever. You're paying a flat fee so focus on quality not the volume.

177
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Let me take care of the volume. You focus on quality, taking the stuff that makes the most sense to you, the most money and just dumping the rest.

178
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I've had that with my epoxy guy. He does not do epoxy countertops. He only does epoxy floors because he's past that. He used to do it, but now it's not good money.

179
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Yeah, it's not worth his time so now he says no to countertops and outsource them over to his nephew, cousin, whatever.

180
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:55,000
What's that? How is epoxy? I've never gone into it. I haven't looked into it too hard either. Yeah, it's great because it, first of all, it's a luxury item so it's something that people want, they fancy.

181
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:07,000
It's not like your toilet just broke and you're pissed off and you just want a plumber to come and fix it because there's shit everywhere, but for epoxy it's like, oh, I want to look at colors.

182
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:22,000
So it's a luxury item and it's usually $3,500, $5,500 all the way up to $8,000 depending on how fancy or how durable you want it and that makes the ticket price, that makes it worth it.

183
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:37,000
So if you can just get someone 15 calls a month, that makes a huge difference in their business. If you get them 15, they close 10. That's 40 grand or 50 grand just like that a month.

184
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:44,000
So if you can start there and then build up and go horizontal or go vertical, you can really make a difference in their business.

185
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:57,000
So yeah, we've done it successfully in multiple big cities, but now I'm trying to go obscure city because all the big cities are saturated obviously, they have dumped so much ad money.

186
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,000
So now we're going to obscure cities to get the most bang for the buck.

187
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Auto referral for it. I just haven't, like from an old client referred it to me. I just haven't done anything with it just yet.

188
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Just watch that ad, watch the CPC in the ad. It is a luxury item so it might be comparable to roofing, it might be comparable to paint, like a house painting, and it could cost you big pretty quick.

189
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:39,000
But yeah, it's successful all the time. If you can find a low enough hang in fruit, it will be a successful campaign.

190
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Yeah.

191
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I don't know if we have any questions yet. I can't see them on my computer so I have to open my phone.

192
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Do you guys have any questions?

193
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Let's see.

194
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
No, no comments. Oh, here we go. Jean.

195
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Hi, Jean. Jean Clinton, Jean Lenton and Luke Pichard are watching. I appreciate you guys jumping on.

196
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Nick Wood says, two of the big dogs with a money bag next to it. Yes, we are big dogs and we're making money bags, sir.

197
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Learn from the best, Nick. Learn from the best.

198
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:40,000
All right. Let's see what else do they want to talk to you about. Oh, yes. What is, you've experienced the churn burn. Now, what is that? Do you have a strategy to mitigate that and stay on top of it?

199
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Because it is heartbreaking, man. I've been through these cancellations and they are the most stressful.

200
00:32:47,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Yeah, it used to get to me. Doesn't as much anymore. I think of it as a good thing in a way now, where if they're leaving, it means the ones that are staying are willing to go that extra mile and the ones that are dropping off, they just weren't able to keep up as we continue to grow.

201
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:23,000
I'd rather have that spot open and find someone else than have it filled with someone that's only putting in 50%. I'd rather them drop off and then find someone that's willing to put in 100% and go that extra 100, like that extra 10% and go 110% to get to that extra mile.

202
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
So that's how I kind of think about it now.

203
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:41,000
It's, I guess the age old saying like it is what it is, like there's not much I can do about it. I got a lot of these times, if they drop off, it's either they've just completely gone ghost and just vanished off the face of the earth.

204
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:49,000
I've learned not to do deals with young people that are into drugs. So I'm not doing that anymore.

205
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,000
How did you pick up on that?

206
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I saw it on Facebook.

207
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I'm friends with, I got friends with a couple of them on Facebook and yeah, I saw one of the blokes that just disappeared on me and I saw him on Facebook, he started talking about mushrooms and everything.

208
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:16,000
So I was like, I went on like a little mushroom trip and redeveloped the world or something. Nothing against it. It's just, it was young,

209
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:35,000
None of them mix well together, pretty much. I think that calls for a recipe for disaster. A couple guys, I think I later on realized they had like a criminal record and sometimes it's worked out fine and they've been awesome.

210
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Other time they've just gone on to start stealing from customers and it's just a, all right, cut off, nothing to do with you. Any customers that ring up, here's their contact details.

211
00:34:45,000 --> 00:35:01,000
That's crazy because I had exact examples. I had a con, who I didn't know was a con, just, you know, wreak havoc, you know, taking deposits and running away and all that stuff, right?

212
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:11,000
You know, just shady contractor stuff. And then I had another one who came up to me clean the first time that we talked and I had just closed him.

213
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:21,000
And he called me and said, hey, I need to tell you something. I am this and this and this. And he went through his criminal record and he said, I need to be upfront with you. I was into this. I was into this.

214
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:30,000
And he was, we just parted ways actually. He was one of my best clients for like three years. But he just moved in a different direction now.

215
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:47,000
But he came to me and he just said, hey, I need to discuss something with you. This is what I've been into. I have turned my life and that is why I changed my last name. This was my last name. Now it is this because, you know, the federal whatever.

216
00:35:47,000 --> 00:36:02,000
But yeah, he was amazing. He was a great, great businessman. And then the other guy was the complete opposite, just a shade. He's never been to the prison, but he was a con for sure. You could like he's been to jail.

217
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:14,000
He hasn't been to prison, but he's been to jail and he's been has been in courts before and stuff. So yeah, yeah. I mean, those those guys exist and I, I appreciate you mentioning it because you've got to sniff out that stuff.

218
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:24,000
And that's why we do our due diligence. That's why we make create those lists and we have the profile, Facebook profile of the owner of the company so we know who we're talking to.

219
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:39,000
You create that avatar in your brain as you're talking to them. Yeah, all this stuff is relevant, especially when it comes to these situations where you're dealing with a young and silly person, an immature person, a con.

220
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:54,000
He's doing well. Like he was doing 20, 30 K a month, like I think I'm not just by profit for his business. So he was doing good. It's just, yeah, obviously when you mix substance and business and try and do it all together.

221
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Yeah, distraction.

222
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Nothing works out pretty much.

223
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Yeah.

224
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I've had clients just a lot of it's just been personal reasons which is out of my control out of their control, whether it's it's family related whether it's injury related and that's like I guess the biggest thing is injury related when it's when they're still on the tools and they get injured, it screws them up big time.

225
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:29,000
That's probably the biggest thing that causes for the downturn and I guess loss of a lot of clients.

226
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Probably and then stress, stress is like another big one, and I guess you can kind of call that under personal but it's a bit of, are you willing to push through that shit and go through it.

227
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:49,000
And I've had some that are stubborn and don't listen when I try and help them out. I've had some that when I say you need to fire this client, or it's like fire this employee.

228
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
They don't fire them and it ends up buying them in the ass.

229
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:58,000
And I could just tell, because I've been through I've listened to other guys tell me this exact conversation.

230
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:08,000
And that's that's something I've realized now like getting sidetracked a little bit is every single business owner is going through the exact same shit so some guys are here some guys are here but they're on that same path.

231
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:21,000
And this person here has been through what this person he is going through. So, what I do often is I'll just talk to this person and say what did you do in this situation, and then pass that knowledge on to this person here, because this person's already gone through it,

232
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:30,000
they've been through that shit they've gone through the headaches and everything they've dealt with those shitty employees. And then this person is just this is their first time going through it.

233
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,000
So I give them that little bit of guidance.

234
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Sometimes I'll even put them in contact with each other so they can just talk to each other and brainstorm different ideas out and solve a lot of issues I've had some clients that went from.

235
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:53,000
I don't know they couldn't land any deals, and I put them in contact with this other guy who kind of had that drama at one stage, they are talking now is landing deals and he booked out for months.

236
00:38:53,000 --> 00:39:12,000
So, that's, that's kind of my biggest, I guess, role now is just connecting the new guys with the experienced guys that I, I haven't have my contacts now. So I'm an old client some existing clients like it's not just like my existing clients a lot of my old clients

237
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:18,000
are still happy to help me out and help help out other guys, it's just, they've moved in a different direction for whatever reason.

238
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Yeah.

239
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Now that's that's a great like connecting them shortcuts the process instead of you showing them how it's done. You show them a business that's almost like a clone of theirs, and they can just copy and paste and swipe all the, you know, the CRM stuff like, yeah, I actually dealt with

240
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:43,000
business owners who do not use the CRM which is crazy. Not even a spreadsheet. I think maybe two of mine do.

241
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Yeah, not even a spreadsheet they just go with their text messages and call and they just store everything here which is super I try and get everyone on a calendar at least create a calendar and use the calendar, and your notepad on your phone.

242
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Yeah, if you want to do stuff use that, because I go, what's called like a diary it just becomes too complicated when you scroll through pages for at least if it's on your calendar you can have a look and see them and they're what's going on.

243
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Yeah, yeah, agree.

244
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Do you have touch points with these business owners do you do you call them or text them often.

245
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Not really like at the start will be in contact but I'm trying to think like there's a client that I close probably like a couple weeks ago now, like those two are probably contacted them once or twice, and it's been maybe three weeks.

246
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:51,000
I think I contacted them obviously when we first spoke, and then I contacted them. Once I got like, like once I started sending the jobs through you can say, I got them all set up so it's all automatic.

247
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,000
That's probably the only two times I've contacted them.

248
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Other guys, I think I've contacted he's probably been with me for two months now probably contacted him twice or three times.

249
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:14,000
That's just like how they are with their business, some guys are contacts, and other guys, I can kind of just let them go, a lot of my older clients.

250
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:24,000
I'm. I want to say I haven't contacted them for like six months but in reality I probably contacted them like at least once a month, just not knowing it that that little mine client.

251
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,000
I think there was a stage there where I didn't contact him for like eight months.

252
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:37,000
We just we just caught up because he's in the same town as me so we just caught up went out for lunch, had a chat, went over things and continued on from there.

253
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:54,000
If possible, that's what I try and do is catch up with clients in person. It's, it's an easier way to know who they are because people can let off a certain side of them over a video call over a phone call, whatever it is but when you look at them in person you shake the

254
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:05,000
hands you look them in the eyes. It's a dead giveaway and that's how I found out one of my clients was going to leave me just from didn't have to say anything, but just him in the eyes shaking his hand seeing what he's doing at work.

255
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:16,000
And just knowing that eventually he's going to cut off and lo and behold he cut off but ended up starting to work with one of his ex employees who ended up going out in his own.

256
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:41,000
So, funny how it works. Yeah, you can tell a lot by meeting people in person and I think they appreciate catching up with people in, in, in person as well. Like I've caught up or going out to events with a few of them now and we've hung out, and I've went out like to like a, like a bull ride, and like them their kids, one of their employees their family they all came out and we all had a good time.

257
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:46,000
That's awesome. Yeah, the personal thing for sure I'm still trying it.

258
00:42:46,000 --> 00:43:01,000
I do have clients all over the US so I can't get into a personal meeting with all of them but the local ones. I definitely tried, and I got a couple of them but not all of them, a lot of them just resist it.

259
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Yeah, happy just keeping it transactional, and that's it. And others are like, I thought the same, and give it some time and they'll flip around is what I found. So I had one guy that just didn't really want to communicate and just kind of left it as is.

260
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:31,000
And now I was like, oh look, I'll come down, we'll catch up, and we'll hang out for a little bit and he's a bit more open to it now. He was, I don't know six months ago when it was like three months into the contract kind of thing.

261
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Yeah.

262
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Like, when, when they want to cancel when when things slow down and they want to cancel actually made a an exception.

263
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Usually, I cancel but I start looking for someone right away to replace, but I made a, instead of canceling. I made an exception and I reduced the price right well since it's organic I'm not running any ads for this one.

264
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:18,000
I slash the price in half actually. So we went from 400 the week to 200 the week, because first of all it's organic and second, it's Christmas. And third, he's having surgery, so he's not going to be able to do any work, he can only schedule out in January and

265
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:35,000
So I'm like, can we do that. He's like yeah absolutely we can schedule I can't work, but we can definitely do that so yeah I slash the price in half, 200 instead of canceling it all over and like starting all over and going and hooking someone new.

266
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:45,000
I thought let me just try this and it worked. And he's like yeah let's do it. Let's slash the price in half, and then we'll reconvene again in January once I recover and pick it up.

267
00:44:45,000 --> 00:45:03,000
So, yeah, yeah, having organic definitely helps in giving you a bit more flexibility of choice with what like options you can provide to them. Yeah. What do you say when someone wants to reduce price but you're, you're running serious as what, how do you, how do you answer that one.

268
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Depends why they want to reduce the price. If they say they don't land any jobs.

269
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Then I say that's on them.

270
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Okay, I try and help them out, but

271
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:25,000
what is it I've had this recently one client, I set the price like $600 a month just to help them out. And I was like all right we're going to increase prices back up to like normal rate of $1,600.

272
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,000
And he just.

273
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:41,000
This was all like my fault, because I did this all over text, rather than call them because it was like Sunday at like 7pm, and I knew he had his kids with them and stuff. So I didn't want to bug him so I just sent him like a text message went to bed.

274
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:53,000
And later on he started texting me and I was busy for like the next two days so it wasn't to like the third day after I got the chance to call him, found out that he was just human pissed off and everything I didn't realize it.

275
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,000
I said look my apologies and stuff I didn't mean any attention like that.

276
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:05,000
And we've come to an agreement where artists continue to increase the price but it would just be like $100 per month increase each month.

277
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:13,000
That way, it's not like a massive increase right off the fucking like right off the bat before Christmas it's like a gradual increase that we can work over.

278
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:22,000
He's still adamant about canceling. I don't think he will, because he relies on the jobs too much, even though he says he doesn't.

279
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:32,000
But he's one of those stubborn guys that just won't listen when he's like I'm not lending any jobs. And I listen back to the calls and it's clearly he's the problem.

280
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:45,000
And I've had other like I, I send these calls to other like other clients of mine and I'll say what do you think of this. And they're like yeah this guy sucks like he can't close any deals he can't talk to the customer properly, his communication shit.

281
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:50,000
He's just, he's just throwing the customer away he's not even trying to help him at all.

282
00:46:50,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Right. Yeah, we're adding more steps I've heard that too like, you know, they they call and you're like hey why don't you send me an email like no, no, that's not.

283
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Don't change the mode of communication. First of all, and second, you keep the ball in your court, don't put the ball in their court because they'll be like yeah screw it I'm not calling them back.

284
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Well go ahead and submit an email with pictures and everything like Are you kidding me, that's not a text message. Send me a text message, your address name and what you need done.

285
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Right, right. So, yeah, that's definitely a factor.

286
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
And I like.

287
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,000
I definitely like digging into their sales process.

288
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:46,000
But also saying hey, the same my business, okay, the same my process, but I'm happy to help and here are some of the things that I see that needs to be mitigated like

289
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:57,000
you guys that listen do really well, finally, follow ups you can just do to I've never heard from that guy. That's your job for follow up five follow ups until you get something.

290
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
But yeah, I definitely see that.

291
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Now tell me about 2025, what do you, what do you got in.

292
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,000
What are you going to start for 2025.

293
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Now I get back up to 40 grand a month. Definitely, and I think have my processes a bit more doled in. I think while I was at that. Yeah, 40k roughly mark by.

294
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:32,000
I was kind of all over the place. I think I think I had too much going on at the same time, and it was a given that it was all going to fall apart because the foundation wasn't set properly.

295
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Where, as long as I build the foundation up correctly then if shit goes to shit, I would have solid foundation where what happened in that case is I built it up without that solid foundation and everything kind of tumbled over and it's happened before it happened.

296
00:48:48,000 --> 00:49:00,000
And then when I went to zero to 10k I had the exact same issue and going from 10 to 20k I had the exact same issue, where I'll basically go from like zero to 10 and then I'll drop back down to like five grand a month.

297
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,000
I went from 10 to 20 and I dropped back down to like 10 grand a month.

298
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:13,000
And now I've gone through the exact same exact same issue going from 20 to 40 and I felt back down to like 25 30 ish.

299
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:26,000
So it's always just to get to that point, realize what I need, and then go back, fix it up, and then go back up there again, and going back up there again is a lot quicker.

300
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,000
The second time around than the first time around.

301
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Right, but I've got no worries about getting back up there getting back up to that scale.

302
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:46,000
From that learning experience a lot of those sites that I now have they're all ranked organically and they're producing organically, so I don't need to run ads anymore for a lot of those sites when I when I find new clients with them.

303
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:54,000
So instead of me having to spend the ad spend on it, I've got leads coming through already where they're generating anywhere from 30 to 90 leads per month.

304
00:49:54,000 --> 00:50:02,000
So I can send those straight to someone else in the, in the new, I've been ready to close up a lot of my team to closing up this Friday.

305
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:18,000
I would pretty much just be focusing on, I guess, building lists out, checking out new areas, seeing what else can be done, creating, I guess, better stops like system operations, and just fine tuning a lot more stuff as well.

306
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
What does your operation look like?

307
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Tell me about the team.

308
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:33,000
So I got a couple guys I got one that looks after like all the backlinking sort of stuff. And then I wrote another one that looks up I would to that look after like all the website builds.

309
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:42,000
So right now I've just built out a bunch of websites and like the fencing and concreting niche, and I just let them go, and then I just go through and find clients for them.

310
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,000
And then I just run the ads and go through that whole process from there.

311
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:51,000
You find the hook, and then you run the app.

312
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:59,000
So, a little bit differently. So I have clients reaching out to me, and then I run the ad, once they pay me.

313
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Gotcha. So that's probably where my process differs from Nick's current process. So I used to do it.

314
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
But now I've just, I got clients reaching out to me.

315
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:17,000
So I'm able to just do it and that's just from Facebook, where they'll just reach out to me from Facebook, say, Hey, look, this is the area.

316
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
This is like the niche room.

317
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:24,000
And how do you get those to reach out to you? Are you running ads on Facebook?

318
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Yeah, just Facebook ads.

319
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Nice.

320
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:39,000
And you call them, they're in, they want the leads and you're like, all right, I will go ahead and start sending them to you and then that's when you fire up the ad.

321
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:44,000
So generally, book a call, that 15 minute call is just me qualifying them. So I still qualify them.

322
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:50,000
And I don't want to, like, I've had people that will book a call and they're just not suitable and I've had to turn them away.

323
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:56,000
So I'm only having the call when I'm only moving forward with the guys that are, one, I have the area available.

324
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:03,000
If the area is not available and I already have a client in that area, I'll send them straight over to my client and say, here, this guy needs work.

325
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:07,000
And they'll just hire them as a subcontractor in some cases.

326
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:13,000
And that's how that solves their employee issue where they need an employee, but they can't find anyone.

327
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:18,000
I'm able to send them one of the guys that reach out to me because they want more work and I'll just pass them straight on to them.

328
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,000
So that's happened in a couple of cases.

329
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:31,000
From that, qualify them and then they go through the process of, we basically jump on a Zoom call and I go through that wholesale script.

330
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:38,000
I'd say 90% like Nix, nothing fancy. I just, I still have that script up and read off it.

331
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:42,000
So I'm not, like, memorizing this stuff or anything. I have it off. I read through it.

332
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:48,000
We go through the process, go through everything, show them what they need to see and then close the deal.

333
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Once I close the deal, I then start up the ads and get everything running.

334
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:57,000
I like it. So, yeah, that is such an efficient way to do it.

335
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:06,000
The way I do it is I run the ad, I make sure that I'm getting leads first, then I go hook and start patching over the calls.

336
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:13,000
I've done enough to do it in Sheets where I know what works, what doesn't work now.

337
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:19,000
There's well over 200 that I have just sitting there and I now know, okay, this is a good area.

338
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,000
This is what bad looks like and I'm able to tell.

339
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,000
That's the whole point of that 15 minute call is we have a chat.

340
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
I get the information that I need to qualify them.

341
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:33,000
So I find out how much they're making, how many guys they got working with them, how long they've been in business.

342
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:37,000
They're probably the main three key points that I look at.

343
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:42,000
But I ask other stuff like what's your goals? Have you done any other marketing before?

344
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,000
What else is there? What services do you do?

345
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
So I can find out all the different services they do.

346
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Some might do concreting and fencing.

347
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Some might do fencing and landscaping.

348
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:58,000
And I find out how else I can help them because it might start off with, all right, we might start off just doing concreting.

349
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Then they might want to expand into fencing.

350
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:05,000
They might want to expand into bathroom renovations or whatever it is.

351
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
And that's where I'm able to sell that down the line.

352
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:15,000
I sell that idea to them on that sales call where we talk about, OK, it's not just the concreting jobs you get now,

353
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:22,000
but you get first choice when we start talking about getting the landscaping jobs that come through as well.

354
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
So I'm not going to go to someone else. I'm going to go straight to you.

355
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
We can start getting you those jobs.

356
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:35,000
So instead of getting 30 to 40 concrete jobs per month, you're now getting 60 to 70 concrete and landscaping jobs down the future.

357
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Yep. You're stacking them that way.

358
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:44,000
They never leave. They're getting everything from you, all their business or half of their business coming from you.

359
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
So it's really hard to...

360
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
And also you're making it a no-brainer for them.

361
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
I mean, the price justifies it.

362
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,000
And yeah, they'll never leave. I like that.

363
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
And I have stacked deals before.

364
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,000
I have done like stucco and concrete.

365
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,000
I have done paint and epoxy.

366
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
You know, the niches that go together.

367
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:11,000
And that is a great way to keep that partner longer because, you know, you're satisfying two things now, not just one.

368
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
And if they...

369
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,000
The biggest thing is as long as you can expand as they expand and you keep up with them.

370
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Yep.

371
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
And as long as they expand as you expand as well.

372
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Right. And even if their concrete sucks, but they're still getting a ton of, you know, lawn care jobs, they're like, oh, it justifies it. It's okay.

373
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Yeah.

374
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Otherwise they would have left. They would have cancelled if it was just the concrete.

375
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Yeah, I like it.

376
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
That's how it is pretty much.

377
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Like a lot of the clients, they'll do fencing and deck building.

378
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:42,000
So they'll get heaps of fencing jobs, but then they might only get a couple of decking jobs.

379
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
The decking jobs they do get.

380
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Like one client or past client now, I think with like the first month of us sending them decking jobs, it closed like 80 grand just off a couple of jobs.

381
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
And that was just in one month.

382
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
That's excluding all the fencing jobs.

383
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:02,000
And I think all the fencing jobs he was doing was like 30 to 40 grand just off the fencing jobs he was making per month.

384
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
That's pretty good. Yeah.

385
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,000
I mean, that's another case that he's not going to cancel anytime soon.

386
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,000
He ended up cancelling. Personal reasons though.

387
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Yeah.

388
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
80,000 of closed business.

389
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Yeah.

390
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,000
I mean, the thing is that he got me someone else straight away.

391
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:22,000
So he found me another business and I started working with them.

392
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Once again, young kid not realizing I guess the effort they required in the business didn't last too long.

393
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:35,000
But now that original client has found me another guy as well.

394
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
So I still talk to this guy.

395
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Like I'm still friends with him and everything.

396
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:43,000
A lot of I'd say probably two of my old clients.

397
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
I went out.

398
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
I went over to one of their places.

399
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
What was it? Sunday night.

400
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
I had lunch with their family.

401
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
So I'm still like friends with them.

402
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:55,000
We're still in talks even though he's just gone a different path in his life.

403
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Sure.

404
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Thankfully from that different path,

405
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,000
I used his connection to be able to get my lawn mowing connection,

406
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,000
another like a lawn to mow at an aged care facility.

407
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
So we're all still helping each other here.

408
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
Wow. Yeah.

409
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,000
I mean, it pays to not burn bridges and nurture those relationships.

410
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
You just got an evangelist.

411
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:20,000
He's like shouting your name from the rooftops and getting you his replacement.

412
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
That is as good of a gift.

413
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Yeah.

414
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Cause it wasn't like it didn't work for them.

415
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
It's just bad personal issues that came up and they had to take a different path in life.

416
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,000
And that's sometimes it's just what it is.

417
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Like not much you can do about it.

418
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:38,000
You can try and I've tried doing this in the past is persuading them elsewise,

419
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:43,000
but sometimes that change is just what they need to do.

420
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:47,000
In his case, it was, yeah, a lot of personal family related issues.

421
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
So he had to just make that choice of, all right,

422
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
for the health of my family,

423
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:55,000
I have to go this route and step away from the business.

424
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Right.

425
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,000
We are.

426
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
No, that's great, man.

427
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,000
And you gained a friend and an evangelist like that.

428
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
And I've had a similar situation.

429
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Also hooked me up with his nephew because he was retiring.

430
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,000
The nephew didn't do so well.

431
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:14,000
And then I got another one on my own and a new business on my own.

432
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
And that one is working well.

433
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
But yeah,

434
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,000
I've been in a similar situation where the guy wanted to retire,

435
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,000
but he didn't want to let go of this cash cow.

436
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:26,000
And they thought they could pass it on to family,

437
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:32,000
but the family was too young and too reckless to do anything with it.

438
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Yeah.

439
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,000
It's hard thing is age and stuff,

440
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
which sucks because like I'm 22.

441
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,000
So it's basically the people my age and a little bit older,

442
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,000
that at the issues when it comes to running.

443
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:49,000
That's crazy that you're 22 and you've already gone through, through so much.

444
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,000
I wish I was as seasoned as you are at your age.

445
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:56,000
I think I was still a student in college, I think when I was 20.

446
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Yeah.

447
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
I haven't even done my master's at 22.

448
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:02,000
I was still a kid or thinking like a kid.

449
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
So yeah, I commend you for that, man.

450
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,000
You're dealing with talking with talking to the big boys,

451
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
telling the big boys what to do.

452
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
That's maturity and leadership for sure.

453
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
So great job, man.

454
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,000
22 years old.

455
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
I'm very impressed.

456
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Yeah.

457
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:20,000
I think it helps being in, in that, that trade role, but I'm,

458
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
I'm in a trade role with myself as well.

459
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,000
I still got a full-time job that I do want to enjoy.

460
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:28,000
So being able to talk the same language as them,

461
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,000
I think helps out break down that balance.

462
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Yeah.

463
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Which was just, I think held back a couple of people is they talk

464
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,000
and they just sound like a generic marketing guy that just repeats

465
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
what everyone else says.

466
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Right.

467
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Absolutely.

468
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Yeah.

469
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,000
I mean, we're bringing the difference we're bringing.

470
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,000
And I get told that at the end of each and zoom call,

471
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,000
I always ask them,

472
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:54,000
What made you follow me around and go on with this adventure?

473
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,000
I mean,

474
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,000
I mean,

475
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:02,000
What made you follow me around and go on with this venture with me?

476
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,000
I'm sure you get in marketing calls all the time.

477
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,000
You've got guys, you know, promising you leads.

478
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Like what, what made the difference?

479
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,000
And they always say it's the approach that we,

480
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,000
we flipped to the approach instead of promising.

481
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
We just bring them the job.

482
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
I'm like, do you want it or not?

483
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
And it's like a,

484
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
I mean,

485
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,000
You know,

486
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:29,000
We make the decision making easy.

487
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,000
So that's what they all say. They say results in advance.

488
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,000
And they say the, the approach, the way.

489
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,000
You show it.

490
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
You don't tell me you show me.

491
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,000
And then.

492
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:44,000
And then.

493
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Yeah, I'll definitely stick with that. That seems to work.

494
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:51,000
The other thing that I talked about just this morning in another life is.

495
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:56,000
The way I keep my churn and burn rate low because I have struggled with this

496
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
from day one.

497
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
People always want to cancel.

498
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Even the people that fall in love with you head over heels, you know,

499
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,000
shit happens in a month later. They're like, yeah, I'm out.

500
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Or their credit card just stops working and you never hear from them again.

501
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:15,000
So what I do now is I told.

502
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:20,000
The group in the morning in the life is I always keep four hooks at all times.

503
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,000
If I sell one hook, I have to replace it.

504
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Because that keeps me.

505
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:30,000
That keeps the standard, the weekly standard.

506
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Because if you lose one hook.

507
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:36,000
And then you lose another hook. Now you're half now you're 50%.

508
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:40,000
And then you go get distracted. You lose two more and then boom.

509
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Now your line is empty. Your sales line is completely empty.

510
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:48,000
And some clients that you closed two months ago are already dropping or six

511
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,000
months ago, whatever.

512
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:54,000
So keeping those four hooks keeps me accountable and keeps me on task.

513
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Is there anything that you do on your end that, that keeps you.

514
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Qualifying has probably been the biggest thing is the harder I qualify and

515
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
the more strict I am with it.

516
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Then the longer they're going to last.

517
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Like if I'm strict and I generally have like a, I got three,

518
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,000
three threes is what I call it.

519
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,000
So they have to be three years in business.

520
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:18,000
They have to have at least three weeks booked out and have to have at least

521
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,000
three, three guys working for them.

522
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:25,000
The minimum that I kind of try and go by when I follow that everything works

523
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:28,000
out like they stick around and there's no dramas.

524
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:32,000
It's when I, if I fall short and say, oh,

525
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,000
they only got one employee,

526
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:37,000
that's when they can sometimes be issues or if they got less than three years

527
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:41,000
in business, that's when they can have issues.

528
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Yes. That's kind of what I go by is those three threes.

529
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Okay. Three employees, three years in business.

530
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
What's the, what's the other one?

531
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
That's just three weeks booked out. That's it.

532
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Three weeks booked out.

533
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Yep. Yes.

534
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:56,000
I have at least three weeks worth of pipeline that already exists because if

535
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:59,000
they've got three weeks worth of pipeline, they start tomorrow.

536
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Like I said, three to six weeks is generally what it takes for someone to

537
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,000
close a deal.

538
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,000
So it means their pipeline is not going to be empty and not relying on my jobs

539
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,000
coming through.

540
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:10,000
It means they have enough work coming through at the moment that's going to

541
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:15,000
keep them busy until they start landing the jobs.

542
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Yep.

543
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
You are smart Levi.

544
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
I think you're very smart.

545
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,000
I'm learning man.

546
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,000
I like this.

547
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Three employees,

548
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
three years in business and three weeks booked out.

549
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:31,000
I mean, I asked you stuff anyways, and I like these metrics anyways,

550
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:35,000
but I never had them in front of me as a standard.

551
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Like this is the parameters that I need to look for.

552
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Set those standards.

553
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Yeah.

554
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,000
And when they're followed, everything works well.

555
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
It's when they're not followed and I try and break them.

556
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
It's, it's a, it's a gamble.

557
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,000
It's me gambling pretty much.

558
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,000
And it's something I have to ask myself is, am I willing to gamble on this

559
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,000
person?

560
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
And sometimes I'm just like, fuck it.

561
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Let's just risk it all.

562
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
And I'll gamble on them.

563
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:01,000
And it will either work out really well or it won't work out.

564
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:05,000
And I'm, I'm happy to just gamble it and see how it goes.

565
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Sometimes.

566
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,000
I don't know.

567
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:12,000
I try and believe in people and give them the best opportunity possible.

568
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,000
And some guys have made the most of it.

569
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Like I said, that guy that pays me a thousand dollars a week.

570
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:21,000
I always going to go back to this guy because he's just one been with me for

571
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,000
over a year now.

572
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,000
And he's gone through all the different processes.

573
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:28,000
And it was just start off with him and his brother.

574
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:32,000
And he was, I think, new to business, new to the area.

575
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:36,000
He had other businesses, which it's kind of what made me say yes.

576
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:40,000
But I was lucky enough that I sent him the jobs.

577
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,000
I was down in the same area catching up with another client,

578
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
like for a different niche in that area.

579
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,000
And ended up just driving to his house, catching up with them,

580
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
having a chat with them,

581
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
told them the price then and there and he shook my hand and said,

582
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
let's do it.

583
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,000
That was the whole sales process was just me saying, yeah,

584
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
it's going to cost you.

585
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Well, I think it was like $6,000 a month.

586
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,000
And he's like, sweet.

587
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Fucking send over what you need to send over.

588
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
We'll get everything started when you're ready.

589
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
I like it.

590
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,000
I like it, man.

591
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
We've already been on an hour.

592
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Let me see if there's any question here.

593
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Oh, hold on.

594
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Luke said, super inspirational.

595
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:26,000
What you've been able to achieve, Levi.

596
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Well done.

597
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Question.

598
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
The question is,

599
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:36,000
one of my struggles is getting business owners on the hook

600
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
because most trades are so busy.

601
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,000
They are not interested in taking the leads because they are booked out

602
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:44,000
so far in advance and don't need the additional work.

603
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
What is your experience with this?

604
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
And have you had,

605
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,000
have you still had success convincing business owners to take the leads

606
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:54,000
even when they are so busy?

607
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,000
Any tips?

608
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:59,000
It all comes to the end if they're willing to hire more people.

609
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,000
I think.

610
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
If they're not willing to hire more people,

611
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,000
then I just call them as they're not a good fit.

612
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:08,000
If they're not willing to expand their business and they're happy with

613
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,000
where they are,

614
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
I don't want to work with someone that's mediocre.

615
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Otherwise I'm dropping my standards down to mediocre level.

616
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:18,000
I want to work with someone that wants to fucking make as much money as

617
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:22,000
possible, take everything, control the whole area, expand here,

618
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
do this, do that.

619
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
That's the type of person I want to work with.

620
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
And when I find someone like that,

621
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:32,000
we work really well together versus if I find someone that,

622
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:37,000
if I have to hard sell them and just convince them otherwise,

623
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,000
it shouldn't have to be a hard sell. It should be.

624
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,000
I've got more work. Okay.

625
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:44,000
So the work I've been coming through now is enough to keep my current team

626
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,000
busy.

627
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,000
But if I can double this workload,

628
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
it means I can have another team going.

629
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,000
And if I have another team going,

630
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:53,000
it might mean I can make an extra 30% revenue for my business or 30% profit

631
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,000
from my business.

632
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:59,000
And it might be an extra 50% revenue for the business as well.

633
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Yeah.

634
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,000
You mentioned a very good, important thing. Keyword.

635
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:10,000
It shouldn't be hard to sell because the process sells us.

636
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:14,000
So yeah, that is a great point. If you're finding yourself,

637
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:17,000
you know, just spewing sales stuff like this is what we do.

638
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
We're awesome. And the leads are this.

639
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
And that that's a red flag.

640
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Something is not like if you have to convince them and they already have a

641
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
customer in hand,

642
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:33,000
they're probably not a good fit and it is your job not to flip the script on

643
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:36,000
them. Start putting pressure. Hey,

644
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:39,000
I don't want to waste your time if you're busy.

645
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:44,000
The only reason I'm sending you these because you said you can take on more

646
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
work in the initial call. If you remember,

647
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:50,000
you said you can take on anything I send you. And second,

648
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:54,000
you're running ads. So that tells me you're not,

649
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:58,000
you're in growth mode. So, so yeah,

650
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
you just flip that script on. I mean, like what happened?

651
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Did you change your mind with why you're being, you know,

652
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
a whiny little, you know what, right now,

653
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:10,000
as opposed to our initial call, you're like, yeah, send all of them.

654
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:14,000
If you're just in for a couple of leads, I totally get it.

655
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:19,000
I'm happy to send you more. I just need you to have respect for my time the

656
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:22,000
same way I have respect for your time. I respect your time.

657
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,000
I respect your time. And if this is not for you, I totally get it.

658
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:28,000
We're all big boys. I would rather go help someone who needs it.

659
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:32,000
No harm, no foul. We're all brothers and sisters, right?

660
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:35,000
So that's what I do. If you find yourself,

661
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Paul, I don't remember who asked the question.

662
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Luke. Yeah. If you find yourself in this situation, flip the script.

663
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:46,000
You don't need to sell yourself. You, you, you set the lead.

664
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
The lead is doing the sales for you.

665
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:53,000
So instead of selling and getting into that desperate position where,

666
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:57,000
you know, now you smell like sales breath,

667
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:02,000
flip the script and ask them, has anything changed since we last talked?

668
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Have you changed your mind? Because if you change your mind, totally cool.

669
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:09,000
I just need to know so I can move on and go help someone else.

670
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:13,000
And that's when you rattle them a little bit and they're like, okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.

671
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:16,000
I didn't say that. I just said that I'm a little busy.

672
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Or they come out of, you know, they come out from behind the curtain.

673
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
They say, yeah, you're right. You're right.

674
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,000
I am busy and this is probably not a good time. Great.

675
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Thank you so much for your time. I'm moving on to the next guy.

676
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:33,000
If this is during like the initial, like trying to hook them, get them interested.

677
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:38,000
I guess my focus would be finding out like, oh, do you want to hire another team?

678
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,000
If they say no to that, note their name down,

679
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:46,000
like put them aside because I've called back business owners before like a year later,

680
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:50,000
six months later, and they're like, yeah, I'm ready pretty much.

681
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:53,000
And they've said, yeah, some guys don't remember me.

682
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:56,000
Other guys do remember and they're like, yeah, just it was a bad time.

683
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
I was going through this that couldn't go then.

684
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:01,000
But now I'm ready. I've got another team set up.

685
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Let's let's start this like right away.

686
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Yeah, I asked that too. And then it is in the next script.

687
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:12,000
You ask how far out they're booked.

688
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:17,000
And you also ask like a hypothetical question where you're like, OK,

689
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:21,000
so right now we're not we're not getting any crazy numbers.

690
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:25,000
But what if we hit like March and we hit a nice stride and now you get double?

691
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:29,000
Like, what's your plan? Do you have people you can reach out to?

692
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Are you able to hire and grow with the thing?

693
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:38,000
And that's when they start to project themselves into into that scenario.

694
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:42,000
Yeah, yeah, absolutely. I have people I can reach out to mark that down.

695
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
They have people they can reach out to.

696
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
They can grow. They can hire.

697
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:50,000
And later, if they pull any bullshit on you, you can you can reference it.

698
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Hey, remember what you said last time?

699
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Yeah, well, these people you reach out to. What's that?

700
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:58,000
And I say to them, yeah, like, what about all these people that you said

701
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,000
you could originally reach out to, like, you know, reach out to them anymore.

702
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
What's up in there? Like, it's only been a week.

703
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
What's what's changed?

704
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:08,000
Absolutely. Yeah, I've done that so many times.

705
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Respectfully, of course. But, you know, you got to call it out.

706
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:15,000
Yeah. And just get the truth. You got to get the truth from them.

707
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:18,000
They're going to dance around the truth.

708
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Keep anchoring them until they give you that you get your name.

709
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:25,000
I hope that. Yeah, I'm very straight up.

710
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:28,000
And I'll just say I won't give you any bullshit from the start

711
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,000
as long as you don't give me any bullshit from the start.

712
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:34,000
And it was that doesn't really questions it.

713
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,000
They straight up with me.

714
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,000
And that's how a lot of guys are spilt out.

715
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
And they said, yeah, like, I've been in jail and stuff.

716
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Like, that's where I got all that stuff spilling out is when I said,

717
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
said that little line.

718
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:47,000
And it helps them relax a little bit because then they know, all right,

719
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
if I'm honest, that means he's not going to bullshit with me

720
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:51,000
and he's not going to say anything.

721
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:55,000
And I'm going to show them because a lot of my calls are just like discovery

722
01:11:55,000 --> 01:12:00,000
calls pretty much where I still have to do the research to see if there's jobs there.

723
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
Nine times out of ten, there is work there.

724
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:06,000
But I still do that research just to make sure as well.

725
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:10,000
Yep. No, I mean, they're contractors at the end of the day.

726
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
So they are pretty direct and shrewd.

727
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:16,000
And it is refreshing for them for you to be straightforward with them

728
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:21,000
because they deal with, you know, uppity calls and, you know, all kind of formal stuff.

729
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,000
And that doesn't jive with them.

730
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:25,000
So when you give it to them straight, they kind of respect that.

731
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Relax. They're relaxed.

732
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
They're not trying to watch their language.

733
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:32,000
They're not trying to think about what they have to do next.

734
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:37,000
I know because I'm in that situation where at work, you know, watch what you say and stuff.

735
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:41,000
But then if you can just relax and say whatever, it doesn't matter.

736
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.

737
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Yeah. Sometimes you just got to let your hair down and, you know, show them the real you.

738
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
And they respect it. They like it.

739
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:54,000
It makes them relaxed, too. It makes them comfortable, to your point.

740
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Awesome, man. This has been great.

741
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Over an hour, an hour and 15 minutes. So that must be pretty good.

742
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Let's see if there's any questions. And if there are not, we'll just wrap this one up.

743
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:09,000
And if you guys have any more questions, you can always drop them in the comments.

744
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:14,000
Okay. Let's take one last question. If there's one. If not.

745
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Sweet. No, that was it. Luke was the last question. So perfect.

746
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:29,000
Guys, if you have any more questions for a rock star today, Levi, from the land down under, please drop them in the comments.

747
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:36,000
I'm really impressed, Levi. You definitely need to pat yourself on the back.

748
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:41,000
It's been a hell of a ride. And I think you're on to something here.

749
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Appreciate that. Yeah. Yeah. I definitely want to follow up on you because you're firing me up now.

750
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:55,000
Now you got my gears grinding. I'm going to go and make some moves right after this.

751
01:13:55,000 --> 01:14:02,000
I'm probably going to build a couple of acts tonight because I need that flow. I was going to wait until after Christmas, but I think might as well.

752
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Might as well just dig in. So I appreciate you, my man. Thanks for jumping on.

753
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:13,000
On an early, such an early hour of the day. And yeah, I will catch you in the group.

754
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:18,000
We may talk to you then. Appreciate you Levi. See you, mate.
