00:00.000 --> 00:03.720
Guys, welcome to the call.

00:03.720 --> 00:14.160
Welcome to the freaking live digital landlords call that we do every single week at 7 a.m.,

00:14.160 --> 00:20.200
every day, every week of the year, unless I'm on a plane or unless I'm in the bush with

00:20.200 --> 00:22.960
no internet, okay?

00:22.960 --> 00:29.640
One thing that I do need to do, before I forget, hold on.

00:29.640 --> 00:33.040
I do need to get a piece of paper because I always, when I'm doing these calls, I get

00:33.040 --> 00:38.260
all these great ideas and then I need to write them down, like I just barely had one.

00:38.260 --> 00:44.880
So give me just a second, I'm going to write this, it's the 26th I think, no, it's the

00:44.880 --> 00:45.880
25th?

00:46.520 --> 00:51.480
Dude, it was the 26th or 25th yesterday.

00:51.480 --> 00:56.960
Um, all right, okay, guys, can you hear me?

00:56.960 --> 01:01.040
Can somebody give me a comment and let me know if they can hear me really, really quick?

01:01.040 --> 01:07.600
Stephanie, Richard, maybe my, dude, that's, I bet you it's my, uh, I bet you it's my stupid

01:07.600 --> 01:09.200
Facebook.

01:09.200 --> 01:10.200
Let's see here.

01:10.200 --> 01:18.600
Yeah, it is, that's really crazy, I can't even see the comments as they come in.

01:18.600 --> 01:22.640
So I'm going to have Porter read the comments because it lags.

01:22.640 --> 01:25.000
Kevin Williams, what's up?

01:25.000 --> 01:26.160
Kurt Dahlstrom, what's up?

01:26.160 --> 01:31.400
Gina Benson, what's going on, Adair, um, I don't know why there's no notification that

01:31.400 --> 01:32.400
I'm going live.

01:32.400 --> 01:35.240
Sorry about that, Kevin Moss, I'm glad that you found me.

01:35.280 --> 01:40.640
Maybe what we should do, Porter, if you're listening right now, tag everyone, uh, actually

01:40.640 --> 01:43.640
let me just let Porter know really quick.

01:43.640 --> 01:44.640
Yo.

01:44.640 --> 01:45.640
Hey, what's up?

01:45.640 --> 01:46.640
Can you hear me?

01:46.640 --> 01:47.640
Yeah, I can.

01:47.640 --> 01:48.640
What's up, dude?

01:48.640 --> 01:49.640
How are you doing?

01:49.640 --> 01:50.640
I'm good, man.

01:50.640 --> 02:01.840
Hey, um, I just want to see, first of all, if they can see both of us because this has

02:01.840 --> 02:03.560
been a really weird thing with Zoom.

02:03.560 --> 02:04.560
Oh, great.

02:04.560 --> 02:07.320
I want to see me.

02:07.320 --> 02:08.320
That's a phenomenal.

02:08.320 --> 02:12.360
Okay, bro, here's what you're going to do.

02:12.360 --> 02:20.960
Hop off and, uh, and then I think if you get on, I should be able to just bring you on

02:20.960 --> 02:21.960
live.

02:21.960 --> 02:22.960
Yeah.

02:22.960 --> 02:25.360
Hop off and just, just watch it as a guest or make a comment.

02:25.360 --> 02:26.840
Let me see if I can bring you on that way.

02:26.840 --> 02:32.520
Cause for some reason, something's up with my stripe or my stripe, my, uh, my zoom, by

02:32.520 --> 02:34.120
the way, welcome Erwin McKenzie.

02:34.120 --> 02:35.120
Yeah.

02:35.120 --> 02:36.120
Hop off and just join as a guest, dude.

02:36.120 --> 02:37.120
And I'll try to bring you on.

02:37.120 --> 02:38.120
Cool.

02:38.120 --> 02:39.120
Okay.

02:39.120 --> 02:40.120
I'll hop off.

02:40.120 --> 02:41.120
Cool.

02:41.120 --> 02:42.120
My comments are finally showed up.

02:42.120 --> 02:43.120
Erwin McKenzie.

02:43.120 --> 02:44.120
What's going on, dude?

02:44.120 --> 02:45.120
I think this is your first live call.

02:45.120 --> 02:46.120
Welcome to the call.

02:46.120 --> 02:47.120
Clellan Bradshaw.

02:47.120 --> 02:48.120
What's up?

02:48.120 --> 02:49.120
Uh, from Beaver, Utah.

02:49.120 --> 02:51.120
Good to have you on, dude.

02:51.120 --> 02:52.120
Mahmood.

02:52.120 --> 02:53.120
What's up?

02:53.120 --> 02:54.120
Stephanie can hear me.

02:54.120 --> 02:55.120
Fine.

02:55.120 --> 02:56.920
Uh, some people got the notification.

02:56.920 --> 02:57.920
Some people didn't.

02:57.920 --> 02:58.920
I have no idea what's going on.

02:58.920 --> 02:59.920
Laura Shepherd morning.

02:59.920 --> 03:00.920
All right.

03:00.920 --> 03:02.480
We're going to try to get Porter.

03:02.480 --> 03:04.080
Hopefully Porter can, uh, join.

03:04.080 --> 03:05.080
Okay.

03:05.080 --> 03:11.040
Let's see if I can get Porter to come on here.

03:11.040 --> 03:14.080
Why doesn't it give me the option to bring Porter on?

03:14.080 --> 03:18.400
It gives me the option to bring on other people.

03:18.400 --> 03:22.920
Uh, that's weird Porter.

03:22.920 --> 03:23.920
I don't know.

03:23.920 --> 03:28.520
Just keep, keep commenting or say something because I, it says I can bring on Gina.

03:28.520 --> 03:31.440
It says I can bring on Kevin.

03:31.440 --> 03:32.440
You know what, Porter?

03:33.400 --> 03:34.400
Try it.

03:34.400 --> 03:36.400
Try to turn it on from your phone and see if that happens.

03:36.400 --> 03:37.400
Okay.

03:37.400 --> 03:40.040
Mahmood says I lost the fight with Raul.

03:40.040 --> 03:41.040
That's my daughter.

03:41.040 --> 03:42.040
She got my nose.

03:42.040 --> 03:43.040
Yeah.

03:43.040 --> 03:44.040
I think.

03:44.040 --> 03:45.040
Yeah, basically.

03:45.040 --> 03:48.840
Um, I got a little preventative, uh, dermatology done guys.

03:48.840 --> 03:51.920
I got some spots burnt or frozen off my nose.

03:51.920 --> 03:55.640
So I'm in just recovery phase here, but it had to happen at some point.

03:55.640 --> 03:58.880
Um, let me see if I can just get Porter on really quick guys.

03:58.880 --> 03:59.880
Then we'll just get going.

03:59.880 --> 04:01.880
I got a few things I want to say.

04:02.320 --> 04:04.320
But I don't know why you have Porter.

04:04.320 --> 04:05.720
Try to jump on from your phone.

04:05.720 --> 04:11.480
Try to watch from your phone and, uh, yeah, let's see.

04:11.480 --> 04:16.240
Really need to get Porter on this thing.

04:16.240 --> 04:17.240
Let's see.

04:17.240 --> 04:18.240
Let's see.

04:18.240 --> 04:19.240
It keeps saying Kevin Masa.

04:19.240 --> 04:20.240
Watching.

04:20.240 --> 04:21.680
That's good.

04:21.680 --> 04:23.320
That is so strange.

04:23.320 --> 04:30.960
Um, let me see if I say at Porter.

04:31.040 --> 04:33.680
Try to watch from your phone.

04:33.680 --> 04:37.800
Yeah, I'm not really sure what's going on with my zoom these days guys.

04:37.800 --> 04:38.800
It's going crazy.

04:38.800 --> 04:41.760
I'm going to have to, I'm going to have to, okay, there that is, that's going to work.

04:41.760 --> 04:46.480
It's going to say, I think it's giving me the option.

04:46.480 --> 04:51.000
It says I can, it says I have the little green button there, bud.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
All right.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.680
Let me see if I can pull it up from my computer.

04:56.680 --> 04:59.780
Let Porter on and then we'll shake and bake here.

04:59.780 --> 05:04.500
Let's see if I can find myself live.

05:04.500 --> 05:17.140
It shows the, aha, there we go, wait, Porter, did that send you notification, bud?

05:17.140 --> 05:18.140
I think we're good.

05:18.140 --> 05:29.300
I think we're going to be able to do it.

05:29.300 --> 05:31.140
Your audience is set to custom.

05:31.140 --> 05:34.140
What is going on people?

05:34.140 --> 05:35.140
Audience set to custom.

05:35.140 --> 05:36.140
Why are there so many settings?

05:36.140 --> 05:38.540
Why can't we just go live?

05:38.540 --> 05:45.340
Ah, boy, audience.

05:45.340 --> 05:48.340
That's crazy.

05:48.340 --> 05:51.700
Porter, it says I'm, I'm, I'm letting you on.

05:51.700 --> 05:54.860
Nick Ford, what's up, dude?

05:55.860 --> 05:56.860
All right.

05:56.860 --> 06:00.820
If I hold on to your name, dude, it's given me this option.

06:00.820 --> 06:05.140
If anyone could tell me what to do here, it says your audience is set to custom.

06:05.140 --> 06:07.820
So many people you select can watch this live broadcast.

06:07.820 --> 06:10.820
That's great.

06:10.820 --> 06:12.820
Hmm.

06:12.820 --> 06:14.820
Hmm.

06:14.820 --> 06:16.580
Okay.

06:16.580 --> 06:17.580
One more thing.

06:17.580 --> 06:18.580
Just give me one second, guys.

06:18.580 --> 06:21.380
If this doesn't work, we're going to, we're going to improvise here, how to change my

06:21.380 --> 06:26.380
audience from custom.

06:26.380 --> 06:27.380
Just see really quick.

06:27.380 --> 06:29.380
There's a way on the menu, top right at Facebook.

06:29.380 --> 06:30.380
Okay.

06:30.380 --> 06:35.380
This should be just a second here.

06:35.380 --> 06:36.380
All right.

06:36.380 --> 06:43.380
It says on my post, hit the buttons, oops, hit the buttons, whoops, whoops, whoops, whoops.

06:43.380 --> 06:50.380
Tap your name, scroll down to the post, tap my name, scroll down to the post.

06:50.380 --> 06:53.380
Oh, boy.

06:53.380 --> 06:54.380
Okay.

06:54.380 --> 06:56.380
I think this will work.

06:56.380 --> 06:57.380
Let's hope.

06:57.380 --> 07:02.380
If not, then we're just going to go anyway.

07:02.380 --> 07:09.380
Groups, DL, and let's try this.

07:09.380 --> 07:15.380
Select change audience.

07:15.380 --> 07:20.380
Ah, well, no.

07:20.380 --> 07:22.380
Well, all right, guys.

07:22.380 --> 07:23.380
There we go.

07:23.380 --> 07:24.380
That's great.

07:24.380 --> 07:30.380
I'm going to put Ashley in charge of this today as the only task that she has to do.

07:30.380 --> 07:35.380
Um, wild.

07:35.380 --> 07:36.380
I don't know.

07:36.380 --> 07:37.380
Okay.

07:37.380 --> 07:38.380
Here's what we're going to do.

07:38.380 --> 07:41.380
We're going to improvise.

07:41.380 --> 07:44.380
Yeah, Porter.

07:44.380 --> 07:47.380
Porter, just hop back on the link.

07:47.380 --> 07:48.380
I'll try to do one or two things.

07:48.380 --> 07:51.380
You might just have to talk, dude.

07:51.380 --> 07:52.380
Let's just do this thing.

07:52.380 --> 07:53.380
Try to jump back on that link here.

07:53.380 --> 07:56.380
Let me send you one more link, and then we'll just get going, guys.

07:56.380 --> 07:57.380
Apologize for that.

07:57.380 --> 07:59.380
While Porter's jumping on, I'm actually going to do this.

07:59.380 --> 08:00.380
Porter, I'm going to send you a link.

08:00.380 --> 08:01.380
I'm going to share a couple of things.

08:01.380 --> 08:04.380
Matthew McClellan, what's up?

08:04.380 --> 08:06.380
Wouldn't Porter be a presenter?

08:06.380 --> 08:08.380
Yeah, I don't know.

08:08.380 --> 08:11.380
I'm going to try to send him.

08:11.380 --> 08:13.380
That's wild.

08:13.380 --> 08:14.380
All right.

08:14.380 --> 08:17.380
We're going to send this one more time, but I'm going to, I got a couple of things I want

08:17.380 --> 08:19.380
to say without Porter jumping on anyway.

08:19.380 --> 08:20.380
Okay.

08:20.380 --> 08:21.380
Here we go.

08:21.380 --> 08:22.380
One more time.

08:22.380 --> 08:23.380
All right.

08:23.380 --> 08:25.380
While Porter's jumping on, guys, welcome to the call.

08:25.380 --> 08:28.380
Um, again, it's Tuesday, February 25th.

08:28.380 --> 08:31.380
It's almost two months into the year.

08:31.380 --> 08:35.380
Six, almost a sixth of the way done with this year.

08:36.380 --> 08:39.380
Exciting and also terrifying, right?

08:39.380 --> 08:45.380
Uh, I, it's exciting if you're actually doing the work, if you're, if you're on track to

08:45.380 --> 08:48.380
hit goals, if you're seeing yourself progress, it's really exciting.

08:48.380 --> 08:52.380
And I've been on the other, last year, I'll be honest, I was on the other side of the,

08:52.380 --> 08:54.380
uh, by the way, Porter, I'm going to let you on just a second.

08:54.380 --> 08:55.380
Let me just finish my thought.

08:55.380 --> 08:56.380
Yes.

08:56.380 --> 08:59.380
Last year I was on the other side of the coin where I was like, oh my gosh, time's slipping

08:59.380 --> 09:02.380
by and I don't know if I think I've done anything.

09:02.380 --> 09:03.380
Right?

09:03.380 --> 09:09.380
Um, and I've said this a few times, guys, admittedly, last year I, uh, I was in a, in

09:09.380 --> 09:13.380
a weird mental fog, but, um, I'm, I'm ready this year.

09:13.380 --> 09:14.380
I'm, I'm here.

09:14.380 --> 09:15.380
I'm ready.

09:15.380 --> 09:16.380
I'm pumped.

09:16.380 --> 09:22.380
Um, one thing that I draw, I want to just remind you guys of, I put this in the, uh,

09:22.380 --> 09:23.380
the group.

09:23.380 --> 09:25.380
I made a post about this.

09:25.380 --> 09:30.380
If you guys have not already, I have a, uh, PDF that I share with you guys with a book

09:30.380 --> 09:32.380
called The Slide Edge.

09:32.380 --> 09:35.380
Go and start reading that book for just read 10 pages a day.

09:35.380 --> 09:36.380
Do it on your phone.

09:36.380 --> 09:40.380
That's probably the equivalent of like four or five pages on a regular book.

09:40.380 --> 09:46.380
Just go read 10 pages of this book every single day and start to make tiny implementations

09:46.380 --> 09:48.380
of what this book is teaching you guys.

09:48.380 --> 09:50.380
And it's going to freaking change your business.

09:50.380 --> 09:51.380
Okay.

09:51.380 --> 09:53.380
Um, I don't, I don't have a kickback from this book.

09:53.380 --> 09:55.380
That link is a free PDF.

09:55.380 --> 09:57.380
This isn't some kind of weird affiliate thing.

09:57.380 --> 10:02.380
It is literally just completely given me so much momentum.

10:02.380 --> 10:03.380
Go check this book out.

10:03.380 --> 10:04.380
I've made Porter.

10:04.380 --> 10:05.380
Watch this or start reading this as well.

10:05.380 --> 10:07.380
If you guys didn't see my post, go and search my name.

10:07.380 --> 10:12.380
Type in Nick Wood, go and look for the post where I gave a, uh, this book, The Slide Edge

10:12.380 --> 10:13.380
by Jeff Olson.

10:13.380 --> 10:15.380
Guys, go start reading 10 pages of that.

10:15.380 --> 10:16.380
Of course you don't have to.

10:16.380 --> 10:17.380
It's your business.

10:17.380 --> 10:20.380
It's your life, but it's, it's been one of the best things I've done.

10:20.380 --> 10:26.380
I started it almost exactly a month ago and everything is completely changed in, in the

10:26.380 --> 10:27.380
better.

10:27.380 --> 10:28.380
And I sincerely mean that.

10:28.380 --> 10:31.380
It sounds a little bit like a cheesier over the top, but I'm dead serious.

10:31.380 --> 10:32.380
It's been amazing.

10:32.380 --> 10:33.380
Okay.

10:33.380 --> 10:37.380
Um, another thing that I was going to just say really, really quick, and this is before

10:37.380 --> 10:44.380
Porter hops on, um, Richard says, can you send that link again?

10:44.380 --> 10:46.380
I'm not really sure what link you're talking about.

10:46.380 --> 10:50.380
My friend, uh, I sent the link to Porter, but he's, he's in the waiting room.

10:50.380 --> 10:51.380
So I'm gonna let him on.

10:51.380 --> 10:52.380
I don't know which link you're talking about, sir.

10:52.380 --> 10:55.380
Um, you know what I was thinking about yesterday?

10:55.380 --> 11:02.380
I was sitting on the treadmill and I have a couple of buddies that I know personally

11:02.380 --> 11:04.380
that are in this group.

11:04.380 --> 11:05.380
Okay.

11:05.380 --> 11:10.380
And, uh, you actually, anyone that knows me is going to think I'm talking about them,

11:10.380 --> 11:14.380
but there's some, there was two specific, there was actually one specific person I had

11:14.380 --> 11:15.380
in mind.

11:15.380 --> 11:19.380
Um, and I was sitting there thinking in my head, like I was about to text them last night

11:19.380 --> 11:22.380
and, and say, cause I went to the gym a little bit late.

11:22.380 --> 11:25.380
I was about to say, uh, where are you at?

11:25.380 --> 11:28.380
Why are, why have I not seen you get a deal recently?

11:28.380 --> 11:31.380
Why are you not, um, posting that you got to win?

11:31.380 --> 11:34.380
You know, and I, that's how my thoughts started.

11:34.380 --> 11:38.380
And then I just started thinking about like Porter, who I'm about to bring on, who's,

11:38.380 --> 11:43.380
uh, at 10,700, he actually went up a hundred dollars after replacing these clients.

11:43.380 --> 11:46.380
And I wanted to just, then I started to just get pissed off.

11:47.380 --> 11:54.380
And I was thinking, like, guys, if you're watching this stream right now and you, like,

11:54.380 --> 11:59.380
you're not annoyed that me and Porter are making the kind of money that we're making

11:59.380 --> 12:01.380
from renting simple websites.

12:01.380 --> 12:09.380
Like you don't know, like the, the, the, the basicness of our personalities, of our education

12:09.380 --> 12:12.380
level, it should, it should piss you off.

12:12.380 --> 12:13.380
Okay.

12:13.380 --> 12:18.380
We are not by any means, oh, it's, you know, like we have, we have no tech experience.

12:18.380 --> 12:19.380
Okay.

12:19.380 --> 12:20.380
We've never done websites.

12:20.380 --> 12:21.380
We didn't grow up doing that.

12:21.380 --> 12:26.380
We grew up literally working on the farm and, and not everyone, I know some of you guys

12:26.380 --> 12:29.380
are beating Porter, but he's beating a lot of you guys.

12:29.380 --> 12:31.380
Like he's kicking your butt.

12:31.380 --> 12:33.380
He is at 10,700.

12:33.380 --> 12:35.380
He replaced two of his clients on Saturday.

12:35.380 --> 12:37.380
He's got another deal in the works this week.

12:37.380 --> 12:40.380
And some of you guys are, I see you every week on the stream and you're still not getting

12:40.380 --> 12:41.380
a deal.

12:41.380 --> 12:42.380
Like, what are you doing?

12:42.380 --> 12:43.380
What are you?

12:43.380 --> 12:45.380
Are you like, are you going to ever get a deal?

12:45.380 --> 12:47.380
Are you ever going to get the next deal?

12:47.380 --> 12:51.380
Are you ever going to, or is it just going to be a constant blame everybody else and

12:51.380 --> 12:56.380
the time that you don't have and the weather and the fact that you got so much going on?

12:56.380 --> 12:58.380
It's like, so does he dude.

12:58.380 --> 12:59.380
He's Porter's got a kid.

12:59.380 --> 13:01.380
Porter's got a full-time thing with my dad.

13:01.380 --> 13:04.380
Like he does every reason to make excuses.

13:04.380 --> 13:05.380
Right.

13:05.380 --> 13:09.380
Why don't you guys, why, why some of you guys I see in here, why didn't you get a deal

13:09.380 --> 13:10.380
this week?

13:11.380 --> 13:13.380
Why haven't you gotten a deal yet?

13:13.380 --> 13:15.380
Why haven't you gotten a deal in the last month?

13:15.380 --> 13:17.380
What are you guys doing?

13:17.380 --> 13:20.380
Like you're getting beat by Porter.

13:20.380 --> 13:23.380
You like, what are you doing?

13:23.380 --> 13:24.380
Porter's kicking your butt.

13:24.380 --> 13:26.380
Have a little bit of pride.

13:26.380 --> 13:27.380
Get pissed off.

13:27.380 --> 13:30.380
Doesn't mean you have to hate on Porter or wish bad on Porter.

13:30.380 --> 13:34.380
But guys, I remember when I was just starting, I would see people posting in the group that

13:34.380 --> 13:35.380
were making money.

13:35.380 --> 13:39.380
And to be honest, I think they were lying because now looking back on it, those people

13:39.380 --> 13:42.380
are, I see sometimes their Facebook friends and stuff.

13:42.380 --> 13:45.380
I'm like, dude, they were never making any money, but that's another story.

13:45.380 --> 13:48.380
And I would see these posts and I would just piss me off.

13:48.380 --> 13:51.380
I'm like, and I wasn't like, oh, they took money out of my pocket.

13:51.380 --> 13:53.380
It was like, Nick, pull your freaking head out, dude.

13:53.380 --> 13:55.380
These guys, I'm looking at them.

13:55.380 --> 13:58.380
I'm seeing the post, whether it was real or not.

13:58.380 --> 13:59.380
I'm going to their profile.

13:59.380 --> 14:01.380
I'm like, dude, this guy, I'm better than this guy.

14:01.380 --> 14:06.380
And I don't mean that in like a arrogant way, but like, dude, I know that if this guy can

14:06.380 --> 14:11.380
get a deal, if this guy's at $10,000 a month, this guy's at $20,000 a month, what are you

14:11.380 --> 14:12.380
doing?

14:12.380 --> 14:16.380
Like, what are they doing that you're not doing?

14:16.380 --> 14:17.380
Come on.

14:17.380 --> 14:19.380
Have a little bit of pride, guys.

14:19.380 --> 14:21.380
I want you guys to get excited.

14:21.380 --> 14:23.380
I want you guys to get on these calls.

14:23.380 --> 14:26.380
I want you guys to have good energy.

14:26.380 --> 14:28.380
But like, when is enough enough?

14:28.380 --> 14:30.380
When is it like, dude, this is too much.

14:30.380 --> 14:32.380
I've got to get a freaking deal, right?

14:32.380 --> 14:36.380
Like, when are you going to draw a line in the sand and say, look, I paid to be in this

14:36.380 --> 14:38.380
program.

14:38.380 --> 14:39.380
I'm here.

14:39.380 --> 14:40.380
I'm getting on the lives.

14:40.380 --> 14:41.380
I've gone through the training.

14:41.380 --> 14:43.380
I've chosen this as the business model.

14:43.380 --> 14:46.380
It's time to get a deal, guys.

14:46.380 --> 14:47.380
You might have to get scrappy.

14:47.380 --> 14:52.380
You might have to call every single person in your phone and tell them that you do lead

14:52.380 --> 14:56.380
generation and tell them that you can get them more leads to get your first deal.

14:56.380 --> 14:58.380
And you might have to follow up with that with that same list.

14:58.380 --> 15:01.380
I think Hermosy talks about this in $100 million leads.

15:01.380 --> 15:05.380
You might have to reach out to every single person and follow up with them every single

15:05.380 --> 15:07.380
day for the next month.

15:07.380 --> 15:11.380
But if you took every contact, you know, that owns a business and you followed up with them

15:11.380 --> 15:15.380
every day for a month, you cannot tell me you couldn't squeeze a deal out of that.

15:15.380 --> 15:16.380
You could not.

15:16.380 --> 15:22.380
You cannot tell me you can't get a $300, $500, $750, $1,000 a month deal by just squeezing

15:22.380 --> 15:23.380
your contacts.

15:23.380 --> 15:24.380
You cannot tell me that.

15:24.380 --> 15:28.380
Okay, guys, me and Francesca are getting scrappy.

15:28.380 --> 15:29.380
We're doing stuff.

15:29.380 --> 15:30.380
We're posting.

15:30.380 --> 15:31.380
You guys saw my post yesterday.

15:31.380 --> 15:33.380
We're posting in yard sale groups.

15:33.380 --> 15:34.380
We're posting here.

15:34.380 --> 15:39.380
She's going to the Chamber of Commerce looking at this, shaking hands, kissing babies, going

15:39.380 --> 15:40.380
around town.

15:40.380 --> 15:43.380
We're doing all kinds of stuff, testing all kinds of stuff.

15:43.380 --> 15:50.380
If you've been in this program for more than two months and you do not have a deal, that's

15:50.380 --> 15:51.380
on you.

15:51.380 --> 15:54.380
Okay, because even if you don't want to run ads, even if you don't have money to run ads,

15:54.380 --> 15:56.380
whatever it is, you should have a deal.

15:56.380 --> 15:57.380
That's just fact.

15:57.380 --> 15:58.380
That's just fact.

15:58.380 --> 15:59.380
You have enough contacts.

15:59.380 --> 16:02.380
You've been alive 18 plus years.

16:02.380 --> 16:03.380
You've got enough contacts.

16:03.380 --> 16:07.380
Even if you're 18, you don't have a bunch of big guys or big women that are your friends.

16:07.380 --> 16:10.380
Your parents and their friends have big people.

16:10.380 --> 16:11.380
Guys, take a little bit of pride.

16:11.380 --> 16:14.380
Get a little bit pissed off that Porter's kicking your butt.

16:14.380 --> 16:20.380
He's at $10,700 a month with a full-time job, with a baby, married, has every excuse not

16:20.380 --> 16:24.380
to be making money, and he's running circles around some of you guys.

16:24.380 --> 16:25.380
We've all got stuff going on.

16:25.380 --> 16:27.380
When I started, I had a full-time thing doing door-to-door sales.

16:27.380 --> 16:29.380
I had a kid, one on the way.

16:29.380 --> 16:31.380
I had a team to manage.

16:31.380 --> 16:34.380
I had church responsibilities, all that stuff.

16:34.380 --> 16:38.380
Guys, I went to the gym every day, and I got deals.

16:38.380 --> 16:40.380
What are you guys doing?

16:40.380 --> 16:42.380
When are you going to have a freaking little bit of pride?

16:42.380 --> 16:44.380
Let's draw a line in the sand, and let's go.

16:44.380 --> 16:45.380
That's all I got.

16:45.380 --> 16:46.380
Okay, let's get Porter on here.

16:46.380 --> 16:49.380
You're not even going to be able to see him, but who cares, because some of you guys...

16:49.380 --> 16:53.380
Porter, can you hear me?

16:53.380 --> 16:54.380
Porter.

16:54.380 --> 16:55.380
Hey, what's going on?

16:55.380 --> 17:00.380
Hey, I'm just going to pin you, because apparently this is the dumbest thing ever.

17:00.380 --> 17:01.380
I don't know.

17:01.380 --> 17:03.380
I'm going to make you the co-host.

17:03.380 --> 17:05.380
We're going to start with that.

17:05.380 --> 17:10.380
Then I'm going to pin you, and then we're going to just go.

17:10.380 --> 17:12.380
Guys, you're not going to be able to see Porter.

17:12.380 --> 17:13.380
Sorry about that.

17:13.380 --> 17:14.380
We're just going to roll.

17:14.380 --> 17:15.380
Listen to his voice.

17:15.380 --> 17:17.380
My Facebook also is lagging.

17:17.380 --> 17:20.380
Facebook has some of the crappiest tools on the internet.

17:20.380 --> 17:22.380
They don't want to work with anyone.

17:22.380 --> 17:26.380
They're like Apple, but at least Apple has good products.

17:26.380 --> 17:30.380
If Facebook wasn't so convenient, I'd get off of Facebook in five seconds.

17:30.380 --> 17:32.380
Screw you, Mark.

17:32.380 --> 17:33.380
All right.

17:33.380 --> 17:35.380
I'm just annoyed right now.

17:35.380 --> 17:36.380
By the way, slide edge.

17:36.380 --> 17:37.380
Sorry.

17:37.380 --> 17:38.380
That's what Richard was talking about.

17:38.380 --> 17:39.380
Thank you, Nick.

17:39.380 --> 17:40.380
He was talking about...

17:40.380 --> 17:41.380
Can you share the link?

17:41.380 --> 17:42.380
There's the slide edge.

17:42.380 --> 17:43.380
You guys can't see Porter.

17:43.380 --> 17:44.380
We're just going to go.

17:44.380 --> 17:45.380
Porter, I'm going to give a little bit of a backdrop.

17:45.380 --> 17:49.380
Porter, he was at $10,600 about a week ago.

17:50.380 --> 17:52.380
He had a client that wasn't paying.

17:54.380 --> 17:58.380
It was one of those deals where they're missing a payment and all this different stuff.

17:58.380 --> 18:01.380
By the way, guys, if you do have clients like this, don't just accept it.

18:01.380 --> 18:03.380
Don't just let them walk all over you.

18:03.380 --> 18:07.380
Realize that you're the one that holds the keys, the leverage.

18:07.380 --> 18:13.380
Anyway, he had this client that wasn't paying, and he knew he had to replace this client.

18:13.380 --> 18:14.380
It's a scary thing.

18:14.380 --> 18:16.380
No one wants to replace a client.

18:16.380 --> 18:19.380
Sometimes we're sitting there going, man, I'll keep dealing with it.

18:19.380 --> 18:20.380
No.

18:20.380 --> 18:24.380
Then he had another one that I think that's another one canceled, right?

18:24.380 --> 18:25.380
No.

18:25.380 --> 18:26.380
He replaced two on Saturday.

18:26.380 --> 18:27.380
Porter, let's share your story.

18:27.380 --> 18:28.380
Let's talk about...

18:28.380 --> 18:31.380
Just share the story of how you lost the clients.

18:31.380 --> 18:33.380
Then we'll go to Saturday.

18:33.380 --> 18:37.380
Guys, I know you're not going to be able to see Porter.

18:37.380 --> 18:39.380
I will get that fixed.

18:39.380 --> 18:42.380
That's the first thing that Ashley's going to do when she wakes up.

18:42.380 --> 18:44.380
If she's not awake already, zoom.

18:44.380 --> 18:45.380
That's crazy.

18:45.380 --> 18:49.380
I apologize, but we're just going to go with this because we want to get the information.

18:49.380 --> 18:50.380
You're going to see me.

18:50.380 --> 18:51.380
You're going to listen to Porter.

18:51.380 --> 18:54.380
Porter, tell the story about how you lost the clients, dude.

18:54.380 --> 18:55.380
Yeah.

18:55.380 --> 19:00.380
The first one, it was actually my first ever client that I landed three years ago, or two

19:00.380 --> 19:02.380
and a half years ago.

19:02.380 --> 19:04.380
Yeah, old nester, dude.

19:04.380 --> 19:09.380
Anyways, it was in Concrete, and he was behind three payments.

19:09.380 --> 19:11.380
He always gave the mentality of...

19:11.380 --> 19:12.380
He always paid.

19:12.380 --> 19:14.380
I always knew he was going to pay.

19:14.380 --> 19:16.380
He was never on time.

19:16.380 --> 19:18.380
It was always two or three weeks past.

19:18.380 --> 19:20.380
I was like, bro, this is so annoying.

19:20.380 --> 19:25.380
I felt like he was almost like that weak link in my business.

19:25.380 --> 19:29.380
I was like, dude, how am I supposed to do this if I had five or six of these same guys?

19:29.380 --> 19:31.380
I was like, I just got to cut the fat.

19:31.380 --> 19:35.380
As hard as it was because I was at 10,000, and I was like, dude, I don't want to drop below.

19:35.380 --> 19:37.380
I was like, he's not paying me anyways.

19:37.380 --> 19:38.380
I'm like, what am I doing?

19:38.380 --> 19:39.380
I'm just sitting here.

19:39.380 --> 19:43.380
That guy basically told him, hey, I got to go look for somebody else.

19:43.380 --> 19:45.380
Sorry.

19:45.380 --> 19:50.380
The next guy, I literally sent him over a lead, and then he called me or texted me.

19:50.380 --> 19:52.380
He's like, hey, when's our four-month contract up?

19:52.380 --> 19:54.380
I was like, oh, it's up.

19:54.380 --> 19:58.380
We need to renew it anyways.

19:58.380 --> 20:00.380
He wasn't closing as many jobs anyway.

20:00.380 --> 20:03.380
He was one of those business owners where he was satisfied to get the jobs.

20:03.380 --> 20:05.380
He was quoting them high because he was busy.

20:05.380 --> 20:10.380
His excuse was, dude, I'm so booked out that I literally can't even take on any more jobs.

20:10.380 --> 20:11.380
I'm basically pointless.

20:11.380 --> 20:12.380
I'm like, well, that's a good thing.

20:12.380 --> 20:14.380
That's what you want.

20:14.380 --> 20:16.380
Anyways, the whole thing, I didn't even try.

20:16.380 --> 20:18.380
Most of the time, I try to make something work.

20:18.380 --> 20:23.380
I try to sell through a client and try to say, hey, let's try this.

20:23.380 --> 20:26.380
This might really help you if they're not selling type deal.

20:26.380 --> 20:28.380
This one, I was like, you can't really argue with that.

20:28.380 --> 20:30.380
I don't know what to say.

20:30.380 --> 20:35.380
That was Saturday of last week.

20:35.380 --> 20:36.380
Both those happened.

20:36.380 --> 20:39.380
Two in one day, I was like, are you crapping me?

20:39.380 --> 20:43.380
It just takes the breath out of you when you lose two clients like that.

20:43.380 --> 20:45.380
That's how I lost them.

20:45.380 --> 20:47.380
Okay.

20:47.380 --> 20:52.380
Porter went from $10,600 per month down to what?

20:52.380 --> 20:54.380
What did that drop you to?

20:54.380 --> 20:56.380
Well, one was $1,200.

20:56.380 --> 20:58.380
The other one was $1,600.

20:58.380 --> 21:00.380
That puts you at $9,400.

21:00.380 --> 21:02.380
You were at $8,800.

21:02.380 --> 21:03.380
Yep.

21:03.380 --> 21:06.380
Porter went from $10,600 to $8,800 overnight.

21:06.380 --> 21:08.380
What a way to start a Saturday.

21:08.380 --> 21:09.380
Love that for you, bro.

21:09.380 --> 21:11.380
What a great Saturday.

21:11.380 --> 21:13.380
I had no idea this was going on, by the way.

21:13.380 --> 21:16.380
Guys, first thing I want to say.

21:16.380 --> 21:19.380
First of all, if you don't have clients, get some clients, dude.

21:19.380 --> 21:20.380
Come on.

21:20.380 --> 21:21.380
Let's have some pride.

21:21.380 --> 21:22.380
Do something.

21:22.380 --> 21:24.380
Guys, the other day I got some stuff in the mail.

21:24.380 --> 21:25.380
You know those value packs?

21:25.380 --> 21:26.380
It's called ValPak.

21:26.380 --> 21:28.380
Have you guys seen those?

21:28.380 --> 21:29.380
I got that the other day.

21:29.380 --> 21:30.380
I saw the mail.

21:30.380 --> 21:32.380
I had an IRS bill.

21:32.380 --> 21:36.380
I had my insurance bill, all those bills.

21:36.380 --> 21:37.380
Then I saw this.

21:37.380 --> 21:38.380
I opened it up.

21:38.380 --> 21:39.380
Dude, I went through it.

21:39.380 --> 21:46.380
Every single one of the little coupons that was a business, that was a home service business,

21:46.380 --> 21:47.380
I put it on the side.

21:47.380 --> 21:50.380
Had a big old stack of them, and I think my kid threw it away.

21:50.380 --> 21:51.380
I think Riggs threw it away.

21:51.380 --> 21:56.380
I put it on top of the stair rail to go up to the office, and I can't find it.

21:56.380 --> 21:57.380
But that's a great way.

21:57.380 --> 22:00.380
Guys, they're paying for freaking leads.

22:00.380 --> 22:02.380
They're paying money to try and get leads.

22:02.380 --> 22:03.380
That's what they're looking for.

22:03.380 --> 22:04.380
Those are great, warm leads.

22:04.380 --> 22:09.380
Anyway, I'm just still on my soapbox about the fact that if you don't have a deal, then

22:09.380 --> 22:10.380
shame on you.

22:10.380 --> 22:12.380
If it's been two months you don't have a deal, shame on you.

22:12.380 --> 22:16.380
Porter, if you didn't know how to do this process, you didn't know how to run ads,

22:16.380 --> 22:20.380
don't you think if you took a list of all the people you know that do concrete, all

22:20.380 --> 22:25.380
the people you know that do fencing, all the people you know that do tree service, that

22:25.380 --> 22:30.380
if you called them and text them and did something every day in 30 days, you couldn't get a

22:30.380 --> 22:31.380
deal?

22:31.380 --> 22:32.380
Oh, for sure.

22:32.380 --> 22:35.380
Through your contact list, I guarantee you get a deal.

22:35.380 --> 22:37.380
Dude, go through your Facebook friends.

22:37.380 --> 22:40.380
Every person that has a company, write it down.

22:40.380 --> 22:42.380
Go buy Hermosy's book.

22:42.380 --> 22:43.380
He talks about it.

22:43.380 --> 22:45.380
He's like, you just reach out to him.

22:45.380 --> 22:46.380
Here's what you say.

22:46.380 --> 22:49.380
And guys, it's literally that's how simple it is.

22:49.380 --> 22:52.380
If it's been 60 days you don't have a deal, shame on you.

22:52.380 --> 22:54.380
Have some pride in yourself.

22:54.380 --> 22:55.380
It's enough is enough.

22:55.380 --> 22:57.380
Guys, we're two months into the year.

22:57.380 --> 23:01.380
Now I'm down just getting annoyed that it's on you.

23:01.380 --> 23:07.380
Borders using the same training that you guys are using to get deals, to replace deals.

23:07.380 --> 23:10.380
So is everybody else out there.

23:10.380 --> 23:15.380
Francesca, who doesn't even speak English as her first language.

23:15.380 --> 23:20.380
Guys, she came to the US as a 16 year old kid that didn't speak English.

23:20.380 --> 23:22.380
She's landing deals.

23:22.380 --> 23:25.380
Not with my help, not using me.

23:25.380 --> 23:26.380
She's landing deals.

23:26.380 --> 23:28.380
You guys need to land deals.

23:28.380 --> 23:29.380
Have some pride.

23:29.380 --> 23:30.380
It's enough.

23:30.380 --> 23:31.380
It's done.

23:31.380 --> 23:32.380
Okay.

23:32.380 --> 23:37.380
So first thing, guys, once you do get deals, just know that you're going to lose a client.

23:37.380 --> 23:38.380
Okay.

23:38.380 --> 23:39.380
I don't care how good it is.

23:39.380 --> 23:41.380
I don't care how many good leads you send.

23:41.380 --> 23:45.380
I don't care how many, you know, whatever.

23:45.380 --> 23:47.380
How many reports you send.

23:47.380 --> 23:50.380
How many times you send them a card in the mail.

23:50.380 --> 23:51.380
You're going to lose clients.

23:51.380 --> 23:52.380
That's just the fact of the matter.

23:52.380 --> 23:53.380
Why?

23:53.380 --> 23:56.380
Because guys, sometimes these clients, they don't know how to close.

23:56.380 --> 23:59.380
And that's not always the case, but that you lose them.

23:59.380 --> 24:00.380
Sometimes it's your fault.

24:00.380 --> 24:03.380
But sometimes, guys, they just suck at closing.

24:03.380 --> 24:05.380
They should never be in business in the first place.

24:05.380 --> 24:07.380
They should be working for somebody else.

24:07.380 --> 24:08.380
But you know what?

24:08.380 --> 24:10.380
They chose to be in business and you're going to lose clients.

24:10.380 --> 24:12.380
So just accept the fact that you are going to lose clients.

24:12.380 --> 24:13.380
That's just it.

24:13.380 --> 24:14.380
Okay.

24:14.380 --> 24:17.380
So Porter, when that happened, what was your first reaction?

24:17.380 --> 24:21.380
Because I've done this before and I've lost clients and it's made me sick.

24:21.380 --> 24:23.380
But I'll tell you, it's a lot worse when you're doing SEO.

24:23.380 --> 24:24.380
But go ahead.

24:24.380 --> 24:25.380
What was your first reaction?

24:25.380 --> 24:26.380
What was your thoughts?

24:26.380 --> 24:27.380
What was your feelings?

24:27.380 --> 24:30.380
Well, the first reaction, I was kind of like, I was pissed off, first of all,

24:30.380 --> 24:32.380
because I was like, this has happened to me before.

24:32.380 --> 24:34.380
And I'm like, I'm providing the leads.

24:34.380 --> 24:38.380
And you kind of just want to just say, I'm just going to take the day off.

24:38.380 --> 24:39.380
I'm just going to lay in bed.

24:39.380 --> 24:41.380
I'm just going to just chill.

24:41.380 --> 24:43.380
I'll start hitting it Monday.

24:43.380 --> 24:46.380
But I actually started hooking my clients Saturday.

24:46.380 --> 24:49.380
I immediately got on the phone and I started calling business owners because

24:49.380 --> 24:53.380
the last time that this happened to me, I remember it took the air out of me.

24:53.380 --> 24:56.380
I almost stayed at two or three deals for a couple months because I literally

24:56.380 --> 25:00.380
was being such a pansy about just getting back on the phone.

25:00.380 --> 25:04.380
I was taking it so personal that these business owners dropped me.

25:04.380 --> 25:06.380
And this time I just had a better mindset.

25:06.380 --> 25:08.380
I was like, dude, I'm not letting this affect me.

25:08.380 --> 25:09.380
Like 10K is where I'm staying.

25:09.380 --> 25:10.380
I'm not dropping below that.

25:10.380 --> 25:13.380
So it was just like the standard of like, I got to stay above this.

25:13.380 --> 25:17.380
Like this, you know, you hit something, you're just like, dude, I'm doing this.

25:17.380 --> 25:22.380
And it's crazy what you can do when you have like the willpower or just like

25:22.380 --> 25:24.380
the, I don't know, the urgency.

25:24.380 --> 25:27.380
I don't know if that's like a better word, survival.

25:27.380 --> 25:29.380
In that book, it talks about being like survival.

25:29.380 --> 25:32.380
And you're like, when you need to like do something, you will do it.

25:32.380 --> 25:33.380
And that's kind of where I was at.

25:33.380 --> 25:36.380
I was like, dude, I got to, I got to get some deals.

25:36.380 --> 25:39.380
Yeah, guys, it's just about standards, right?

25:39.380 --> 25:43.380
So this is a really simple analogy that I've heard.

25:43.380 --> 25:44.380
You've probably heard a million times.

25:44.380 --> 25:45.380
I'm not trying to pretend it's my own.

25:45.380 --> 25:46.380
It's not original.

25:46.380 --> 25:49.380
It's like we have this financial thermostat, right?

25:49.380 --> 25:54.380
And how a thermostat works is how the analogy goes is when you have a thermostat

25:54.380 --> 25:58.380
set at 70, if it gets to 68, the heat kicks on, right?

25:58.380 --> 25:59.380
You go back to 70.

25:59.380 --> 26:04.380
If it gets to 72, the cool, the AC kicks on to go back to 70.

26:04.380 --> 26:07.380
We have this thermostat of what we think we're worth.

26:07.380 --> 26:12.380
And as soon as we go below it, we're going to do everything we can to get to it.

26:12.380 --> 26:13.380
It's crazy.

26:13.380 --> 26:17.380
Like we start scrapping our way and we start going into like, I can't breathe mode.

26:17.380 --> 26:21.380
We start going into like, this is the only thing that matters.

26:21.380 --> 26:23.380
Nothing else is important.

26:23.380 --> 26:27.380
I got to get back to the certain baseline and you'll do everything.

26:27.380 --> 26:29.380
You'll get scrappy, creative, everything.

26:29.380 --> 26:31.380
And the reverse is true, too.

26:31.380 --> 26:35.380
You think you're worth 10K a month and you make 15K one month and all of a sudden you

26:35.380 --> 26:36.380
start self-sabotaging.

26:36.380 --> 26:37.380
You start taking the day off.

26:37.380 --> 26:38.380
You start doing all this stuff.

26:38.380 --> 26:42.380
So the key is like, how do you get your standard hire?

26:42.380 --> 26:46.380
Some of you guys, and I'm not trying to be rude here, but clearly some of you guys have

26:46.380 --> 26:48.380
a standard of making no money, right?

26:48.380 --> 26:52.380
Like in this business, your standard is zero because you're not urgent.

26:52.380 --> 26:55.380
You're not doing whatever it takes to get a deal.

26:55.380 --> 27:01.380
You're content sitting there watching the training for the third time in a row and

27:01.380 --> 27:05.380
tweedling around with your website when you need to just pick up the phone and call

27:05.380 --> 27:11.380
somebody or walk into a business or go on Facebook or call your uncle or whatever.

27:11.380 --> 27:12.380
But get a deal.

27:12.380 --> 27:14.380
Make something happen, right?

27:14.380 --> 27:16.380
So it's a good point.

27:16.380 --> 27:21.380
Once you get to a certain point, guys, and I feel like when you get to these really good,

27:21.380 --> 27:24.380
even numbers, like you get to the 10K and you kind of have this identity.

27:24.380 --> 27:27.380
And it's really good, too, because everyone wants Porter hit 10K.

27:27.380 --> 27:28.380
We're like, hey, Porter's at 10K.

27:28.380 --> 27:30.380
Last thing he wants to do is drop below 10K.

27:30.380 --> 27:32.380
He's now a 10K person, right?

27:32.380 --> 27:38.380
When I made seven figures in 2020, it was the weirdest thing in my mind.

27:38.380 --> 27:39.380
I was like, oh, I can't go.

27:39.380 --> 27:41.380
I can never make less than a million dollars, right?

27:42.380 --> 27:45.380
I can never make less than a million dollars no matter what happens.

27:45.380 --> 27:49.380
And guys, even like, for example, last year, it was a weird year.

27:49.380 --> 27:52.380
A lot of personal stuff took my eye off the ball in some ways.

27:52.380 --> 27:53.380
Maybe you guys saw it.

27:53.380 --> 27:54.380
Maybe you didn't.

27:54.380 --> 27:55.380
But I did.

27:55.380 --> 28:01.380
Even then, I still made far above a million dollars, like well above a million dollars,

28:01.380 --> 28:06.380
because even with all the distraction, even with all the personal stuff, I knew, hey,

28:06.380 --> 28:08.380
I don't make less than a million dollars.

28:08.380 --> 28:13.380
And so this year, I sat down and I was like, it's time for me to change that standard.

28:13.380 --> 28:16.380
Like, a million is no longer even close to acceptable.

28:16.380 --> 28:22.380
And the same way that I'm telling you guys you should get annoyed that Porter's at $10,600,

28:22.380 --> 28:28.380
$10,700, is I'm looking at people around me that I know that are making a million dollars a month

28:28.380 --> 28:29.380
in one of their businesses.

28:29.380 --> 28:32.380
And I'm like, dude, there's nothing different between that guy and me.

28:32.380 --> 28:34.380
Why are they beating me?

28:34.380 --> 28:35.380
What am I doing?

28:35.380 --> 28:40.380
Why am I still content at making a couple million bucks when I should be making five figures?

28:40.380 --> 28:42.380
I should be at $10 million a month.

28:42.380 --> 28:45.380
I made my first million five years ago, four years ago.

28:45.380 --> 28:47.380
You know, I should be at 10.

28:47.380 --> 28:49.380
I should be at 10 plus, period.

28:49.380 --> 28:50.380
What am I doing?

28:50.380 --> 28:51.380
What are you doing, Nick?

28:51.380 --> 28:52.380
Big wake up call.

28:52.380 --> 28:53.380
Roll my goals down.

28:53.380 --> 28:55.380
And this year, everything's changing.

28:55.380 --> 28:56.380
Changing my standard.

28:56.380 --> 28:57.380
Getting around different people.

28:57.380 --> 29:06.380
So Porter, how did you how do you think people can change their standard of what they think they're worth?

29:06.380 --> 29:11.380
And I don't want to get too much into like this mindset stuff because I want to keep this on tactical stuff.

29:11.380 --> 29:18.380
But also, how does somebody that's never gotten a deal or that's barely making two, three thousand, four thousand bucks,

29:18.380 --> 29:25.380
barely paying the bills at their regular job, how do they get the mindset of like, hey, I have to I have to make a certain amount?

29:25.380 --> 29:26.380
Like, how do you create that?

29:26.380 --> 29:27.380
How did you get to that point?

29:31.380 --> 29:32.380
It definitely took a little bit of time.

29:32.380 --> 29:38.380
I wish I would have gotten there faster because now that you've gotten there, you look back and you're like, if I would have just changed a few of these things,

29:38.380 --> 29:50.380
I think the number one thing is I just think I was so analysis paralysis or I was too afraid to like make a jump in like spending money or doing certain things.

29:50.380 --> 29:54.380
Like it's like you kind of just dabble, you know, for a while you're just dabbling.

29:54.380 --> 29:56.380
You're like, I'm going to run a website, I'm going to run an ad.

29:56.380 --> 29:58.380
And then you're like, I'm going to call a business owner.

29:58.380 --> 29:59.380
I'm also going to call like five of them.

29:59.380 --> 30:01.380
If one of them pick up, I'll do it.

30:01.380 --> 30:06.380
But then it becomes like it's like, no, I'm going to do this until I get it.

30:06.380 --> 30:07.380
I'm going to get someone on the hook.

30:07.380 --> 30:10.380
And then it's like, no, I'm going to run this ad until I get leads.

30:10.380 --> 30:13.380
Like, there's no reason I shouldn't because I've seen it work.

30:13.380 --> 30:16.380
And it's like there's too many people in the group.

30:17.380 --> 30:26.380
The thing that changed it for me was, again, seeing people in the group get deals that I knew that I thought I was better than them in a humble way.

30:26.380 --> 30:28.380
But like I thought I could do better than them.

30:28.380 --> 30:39.380
And so I think seeing other people get deals, I knew the process worked, but I knew it was my insecurities and my personal feelings of like what I thought I was capable of.

30:39.380 --> 30:41.380
That was the biggest thing holding me back.

30:41.380 --> 30:52.380
So I think I honestly for me to get to that point, I think I had to fake it until like I literally had to say, hey, I think I'm worth this, even though I necessarily don't feel like I am, but I'm going to be this.

30:52.380 --> 30:54.380
Like, you know what I'm saying?

30:54.380 --> 30:56.380
Like, that's kind of what you have to do until you feel that way.

30:56.380 --> 30:58.380
Yeah, I agree.

30:58.380 --> 31:06.380
And another thing, guys, another thing that will really help you is getting around people that are making a lot more money than you.

31:07.380 --> 31:11.380
And I'm not saying that that should be the only thing that you look for in friends, right?

31:11.380 --> 31:14.380
Because if they're just crappy human beings, that may not be worth it.

31:14.380 --> 31:16.380
But we are talking about money in this group.

31:16.380 --> 31:22.380
This group is not necessarily a group we're talking about, you know, whatever.

31:22.380 --> 31:23.380
We're talking about money.

31:23.380 --> 31:24.380
We're talking about money.

31:24.380 --> 31:39.380
So in that regard, guys, one of the easiest ways to really get your standards changed or really to shake up your to really mind after yourself is start getting around people that are making way more money than you.

31:39.380 --> 31:40.380
Right.

31:40.380 --> 31:42.380
Because all of a sudden you start to see the way that they live their lives.

31:42.380 --> 31:48.380
You start to see the way that they don't even think about the decisions they make aren't based on price.

31:48.380 --> 31:52.380
They're based on convenience and time and, you know, things like that.

31:52.380 --> 31:58.380
Like, I remember when I started hanging out with one of my only friends, I don't have a lot of friends that I really hang out with one of my only friends.

31:58.380 --> 32:01.380
And I started to make I was starting to make a little bit of money.

32:01.380 --> 32:07.380
I think this is around I actually became friends with them before I made my first seven figures.

32:07.380 --> 32:15.380
But I remember that the first time I made some decent money, he's we went to Mexico and I'm like, so where are we going to stay?

32:15.380 --> 32:16.380
And he just sent me the link.

32:16.380 --> 32:23.380
He's like, I booked here and I pulled it up and it was like, you know, five hundred six hundred bucks a night, not all inclusive.

32:23.380 --> 32:24.380
This is just for the room.

32:24.380 --> 32:30.380
And I was like, you know, obviously, it can't be I got to just I can't say, oh, let's go somewhere cheaper.

32:30.380 --> 32:31.380
I'm like, all right.

32:31.380 --> 32:34.380
So, you know, I went there for like a five, six days.

32:34.380 --> 32:37.380
It was like two, three, twenty five hundred three thousand dollars.

32:37.380 --> 32:42.380
And I was like, dude, if I want to continue to be this guy's friend where I get invited to go to do stuff.

32:42.380 --> 32:50.380
I mean, the guy's talking about like, hey, I don't let's just let's just split a private plane to go down there so we can just go straight out of, you know, St.

32:50.380 --> 32:51.380
George Airport.

32:51.380 --> 32:53.380
He started to make these kind of comments.

32:53.380 --> 32:55.380
I got me like, OK, I got it.

32:55.380 --> 32:56.380
I got to pull my head out.

32:56.380 --> 32:57.380
What am I doing?

32:57.380 --> 33:02.380
I'm sitting over here thinking I'm hot crap making, you know, a hundred grand a month.

33:02.380 --> 33:04.380
This dude's making a million dollars a month.

33:04.380 --> 33:05.380
Like, I got to step this thing up.

33:05.380 --> 33:11.380
So, guys, you start getting around people that are making a lot more than you.

33:11.380 --> 33:17.380
I guess I should say this, they have higher standards than you and you are naturally going to have higher standards.

33:17.380 --> 33:18.380
Porter, how do you do that?

33:18.380 --> 33:21.380
Because Porter lives in a town.

33:21.380 --> 33:25.380
And by the way, there's some people in this in that town that are in this group.

33:25.380 --> 33:27.380
And guys, welcome.

33:27.380 --> 33:28.380
I know there's a couple of you guys that joined recently.

33:28.380 --> 33:29.380
Dakota.

33:29.380 --> 33:32.380
I don't know if you're on here, Dakota, but if you are, welcome, dude.

33:32.380 --> 33:35.380
He's in a town where there's some people that are doing some things.

33:35.380 --> 33:40.380
But a lot of the people, I would say the average income in that town, it's got to be like four grand.

33:40.380 --> 33:41.380
Right.

33:41.380 --> 33:42.380
Maybe monthly.

33:42.380 --> 33:44.380
Maybe maybe four to six grand.

33:44.380 --> 33:51.380
And people are really content with that, which in some ways I actually really respect because it's like, yeah, money doesn't make you happy.

33:51.380 --> 33:52.380
I get that.

33:52.380 --> 34:01.380
But it's also it's tough when you're around that type of people all the time that like you're the big frickin dog, man.

34:01.380 --> 34:03.380
You're you're making 10 grand, dude.

34:03.380 --> 34:07.380
You know, your your donation at church is fat, dude.

34:08.380 --> 34:11.380
And it's like, no, you're tricking little small chimp.

34:11.380 --> 34:12.380
You're like, you're just a little fish.

34:12.380 --> 34:13.380
Right.

34:13.380 --> 34:15.380
And I'm the same way compared to a lot of people, too.

34:15.380 --> 34:16.380
How do you do that?

34:16.380 --> 34:24.380
How do you how do you have the high standard of, you know, hey, by the way, Porter, 10 grand, you're still making baby money, bro.

34:24.380 --> 34:25.380
Let's go.

34:25.380 --> 34:26.380
I know.

34:26.380 --> 34:27.380
You are, dude.

34:27.380 --> 34:28.380
Come on.

34:28.380 --> 34:29.380
I mean, let's see.

34:29.380 --> 34:30.380
Twenty.

34:30.380 --> 34:31.380
What are you?

34:31.380 --> 34:32.380
Twenty five.

34:32.380 --> 34:33.380
Yeah, it is unacceptable.

34:33.380 --> 34:34.380
Twenty five, twelve.

34:34.380 --> 34:36.380
So you're like you're ripping like 120 a year.

34:36.380 --> 34:38.380
I mean, dude, at twenty five, I'd be like two hundred and ten.

34:38.380 --> 34:39.380
Just no.

34:39.380 --> 34:43.380
I mean, throw your face a little bit, a little bit, a little salt in the wound.

34:43.380 --> 34:44.380
You got it.

34:44.380 --> 34:45.380
You get you're not.

34:45.380 --> 34:46.380
You got to pick this up, dude.

34:46.380 --> 34:47.380
Twenty K.

34:47.380 --> 34:49.380
Then we can start, you know, flexing a tiny bit.

34:49.380 --> 34:51.380
But how do you do it, bro?

34:51.380 --> 34:57.380
Because I know that what it's like, like and that's one of the reasons I like to be around people that are successful.

34:57.380 --> 34:59.380
That's one of the reasons I like to be in Dubai.

34:59.380 --> 35:02.380
I look around. I'm like, dude, every other person's got a frickin Lambo.

35:02.380 --> 35:05.380
I don't know if it's drug money, but nonetheless, they got cash.

35:06.380 --> 35:09.380
Dinner, seven hundred and fifty dollars for two people.

35:09.380 --> 35:10.380
That's you got to have cash.

35:10.380 --> 35:16.380
What what do you do when you live around people that are at a lower standard to raise the standard?

35:18.380 --> 35:22.380
I think I try to do that that same mindset, but it's got to be online.

35:22.380 --> 35:24.380
It's got to be within the group.

35:24.380 --> 35:28.380
It's got to be like I'm rubbing shoulders with with obviously you.

35:28.380 --> 35:34.380
I talked to Jeff like you talked to Francesca like you just talked to people that you know are making money or landing deals constantly.

35:34.380 --> 35:36.380
Like Mahmood making good money.

35:36.380 --> 35:38.380
And it just kind of just makes you wait.

35:38.380 --> 35:41.380
Sixty five K a month. He doesn't talk that he doesn't.

35:41.380 --> 35:43.380
Yeah, as much as that sixty five K a month.

35:43.380 --> 35:44.380
He's a sleeper. Keep going.

35:44.380 --> 35:47.380
Yeah. But like that, it's just like, dude, these guys are making a lot of money.

35:47.380 --> 35:51.380
So it's like I have to like be around those people in the group.

35:51.380 --> 35:58.380
So like, yeah, if you can't be there physically, try to be there, you know, socially on their rub shoulders with them.

35:58.380 --> 36:03.380
Comment like I for the longest time, I hated posting because I just didn't want you.

36:03.380 --> 36:05.380
You don't know. You don't want people to know you.

36:05.380 --> 36:06.380
You know what I'm saying?

36:06.380 --> 36:08.380
Like, especially I'm your brother, too.

36:08.380 --> 36:10.380
So I'm like kind of like hiding back and whatever.

36:10.380 --> 36:12.380
And then I'm like, you know, then you kind of change.

36:12.380 --> 36:15.380
You're like, what's so bad about people knowing your business in a way?

36:15.380 --> 36:16.380
You know what I'm saying?

36:16.380 --> 36:18.380
You kind of switch the mindset.

36:18.380 --> 36:24.380
And so I think as soon as I started doing that, I kind of just was like it was like this eye opening thing.

36:24.380 --> 36:29.380
It's crazy when you really start to think that you're you're actually this like right now.

36:30.380 --> 36:36.380
But you're a big fish in a small pond, but but you're really a small fish and, you know, a massive pond, right?

36:36.380 --> 36:37.380
That's kind of what you need to be.

36:37.380 --> 36:44.380
So I just try to do it online and the Facebook group post be around people that can motivate you.

36:44.380 --> 36:49.380
Yeah, guys, that's one of the reasons that you you maybe you didn't even join for this reason.

36:49.380 --> 36:55.380
But this is one of the best things about this community is think about where we all came from.

36:55.380 --> 36:57.380
We all have our lives. We're all in our situations.

36:57.380 --> 36:59.380
We're all surrounded by people that are living average lives.

36:59.380 --> 37:02.380
Maybe we were in the free Facebook group.

37:02.380 --> 37:05.380
Maybe you came from the school community, you know, whatever.

37:05.380 --> 37:11.380
And we basically sucked all the people out of there that are ready to do this for real.

37:11.380 --> 37:14.380
Right. And so we filtered everyone out.

37:14.380 --> 37:17.380
And these are the people in this group that are here to do this for real.

37:17.380 --> 37:20.380
And you are surrounded by all the winners.

37:20.380 --> 37:24.380
Right. Ma Moon's making sixty five thousand dollars a month.

37:24.380 --> 37:26.380
Mike V's making forty thousand dollars a month.

37:26.380 --> 37:30.380
These are U.S. numbers, by the way.

37:30.380 --> 37:32.380
I'm not going to say this guy's name, because I don't know if he wants me to.

37:32.380 --> 37:34.380
But there's a guy that just joined. This is not Ryan Dalton.

37:34.380 --> 37:36.380
He makes one hundred and twenty thousand dollars per month.

37:36.380 --> 37:39.380
He's not talking much, but he's in the group. He just joined.

37:39.380 --> 37:42.380
We got Ryan Dalton six hundred thousand dollars a month.

37:42.380 --> 37:46.380
Jeff, I don't know what Jeff's at. Twenty thousand plus.

37:46.380 --> 37:50.380
Levi's at fifteen thousand plus. Jason's at fourteen something.

37:50.380 --> 37:53.380
Stephanie's at, by the way, shout out to Stephanie, twelve thousand nine hundred.

37:53.380 --> 37:56.380
There's Juan Finesse's at forty thousand plus.

37:56.380 --> 37:58.380
Russ Ether's at forty thousand plus.

37:58.380 --> 38:03.380
Guys, you are surrounded by people that are making some freaking cheddar in this group.

38:03.380 --> 38:06.380
So go and be of value to these people.

38:06.380 --> 38:09.380
Do not message them and say, hey, can I jump on the phone with you?

38:09.380 --> 38:12.380
Because I'm going to not let them. OK, they're not going to.

38:12.380 --> 38:14.380
But like, add some value.

38:14.380 --> 38:19.380
If you see one of them post and you have an answer or you find something valuable, share it with them.

38:19.380 --> 38:22.380
Go and make yourself known. You don't have to be super loud.

38:22.380 --> 38:24.380
But like Porter's been doing a really good job.

38:24.380 --> 38:28.380
He's been sharing his wins, sharing where he's at, sharing his losses. Right.

38:28.380 --> 38:30.380
And then people can say they know who he is.

38:30.380 --> 38:34.380
And that's not a bad thing, because now Porter's like, I'm the 10K guy.

38:34.380 --> 38:37.380
Well, if you're at eight today, we'd just be freaking roasting you, dude.

38:37.380 --> 38:41.380
You can't go below ten. Right. You can't go below.

38:41.380 --> 38:46.380
Guys, go read freaking Porter. Tell these guys about slight edge.

38:46.380 --> 38:49.380
I had Porter start the slight edge. Give it give it a review.

38:49.380 --> 38:51.380
What are you on page like 80?

38:51.380 --> 38:55.380
Yeah, I'm on page like 80. But it's it's totally like when you first like the first.

38:55.380 --> 38:59.380
It's one of those books that it's not you don't have to wait a few chapters to get into it.

38:59.380 --> 39:03.380
It's like it like hits hard and like the first couple of pages.

39:03.380 --> 39:06.380
Like it's insane. Right. Yeah.

39:06.380 --> 39:08.380
It is so cool. But it just makes you like this.

39:08.380 --> 39:12.380
It's all your mindset. And it's like you already know what to freaking do, guys.

39:12.380 --> 39:15.380
It's just us. Yeah. You just got it. It's all these little things.

39:15.380 --> 39:21.380
Guys, if you want to skip to a chapter talking about this, this specific topic of, you know,

39:21.380 --> 39:25.380
learning a specific skill, Chapter 13 talks about mentors.

39:25.380 --> 39:27.380
And that's anyway, just as a quick note.

39:27.380 --> 39:31.380
And I know that because I've been recommending this book to a lot of people recommending certain chapters,

39:31.380 --> 39:33.380
screenshotting pieces.

39:33.380 --> 39:38.380
This is just a very simple book about a simple strategy that if you'll just do these things,

39:38.380 --> 39:40.380
guys, everything's going to change for you.

39:40.380 --> 39:42.380
Like just simple stuff. Reading 10 pages a day.

39:42.380 --> 39:46.380
Just all like just these little tiny things. Right.

39:46.380 --> 39:48.380
If depending on what your goals are.

39:48.380 --> 39:52.380
For me, it's like I need to make a post every single day on certain social media channels.

39:52.380 --> 39:55.380
I need to do.

39:55.380 --> 39:57.380
I mean, obviously the gym to me.

39:57.380 --> 39:59.380
That's just the standard at this point.

39:59.380 --> 40:01.380
I need to make a certain amount of money.

40:01.380 --> 40:05.380
But in order to make that certain amount of money, I have to do these little tiny things.

40:05.380 --> 40:08.380
So guys, go freaking just just 10 pages on your phone every day.

40:08.380 --> 40:10.380
What does it take you 10 minutes?

40:10.380 --> 40:12.380
Oh, not even that.

40:12.380 --> 40:16.380
You know, sometimes like yesterday I was eating Chipotle after the gym, which that's it.

40:16.380 --> 40:17.380
That was a decision, right?

40:17.380 --> 40:24.380
Like, hey, I'm going to eat this 600, 700 calorie bowl instead of going and smashing Buffalo Wild Wings and waking up groggy.

40:24.380 --> 40:26.380
You know what I mean? Like those little tiny things.

40:26.380 --> 40:28.380
Drinking water. I stopped drinking soda.

40:28.380 --> 40:30.380
I stopped drinking energy drinks.

40:30.380 --> 40:32.380
Right. These are little tiny things.

40:32.380 --> 40:34.380
I started focusing on my sleep.

40:34.380 --> 40:36.380
Shout out to the whoop and Christiano Ronaldo.

40:36.380 --> 40:38.380
Your boys get that dialed in sleep.

40:38.380 --> 40:40.380
These are all little things that are contributing.

40:40.380 --> 40:42.380
Anyway, guys, so we're going to get back into the tactical.

40:42.380 --> 40:45.380
So I just wanted to go on a little soapbox on that, but go check out that book.

40:45.380 --> 40:53.380
So guys, to raise that mindset, get around people to raise the standard, get around people that are making a lot more money than you.

40:53.380 --> 40:55.380
And this group is a perfect way to do it.

40:55.380 --> 41:04.380
You can do it by getting on these calls and listening to the mindset, listening to the like, you know, people that have, you know, options, people that have freedom.

41:04.380 --> 41:06.380
You get around that. It gets infectious.

41:06.380 --> 41:09.380
They have the ability to go and do stuff that you can't.

41:09.380 --> 41:11.380
And it's exciting and it should piss you off a little bit.

41:11.380 --> 41:14.380
So, okay, Porter, let's talk about what you did.

41:14.380 --> 41:20.380
So as soon as you got the news that you're losing the deals, you decided.

41:20.380 --> 41:23.380
So you actually got the news on Saturday morning that you lost the deals.

41:23.380 --> 41:25.380
Or does it Friday?

41:25.380 --> 41:27.380
No, it was Saturday morning, dude.

41:27.380 --> 41:28.380
It was the chitiest Saturday, dude.

41:28.380 --> 41:32.380
My heart hurt. It was like my dog died or something, dude.

41:32.380 --> 41:34.380
It's so sad, dude.

41:34.380 --> 41:37.380
And it's worse when you have kids because you're like your kids.

41:37.380 --> 41:41.380
You're like, dude, that just took some opportunity out of my.

41:41.380 --> 41:44.380
We could have taken a little forward to Disney.

41:44.380 --> 41:46.380
You know, dude, I felt so bad a little bit.

41:46.380 --> 41:47.380
Okay.

41:47.380 --> 41:54.380
So so you got the news on both or you the one you kind of knew was coming, but the one you hit hit you on Saturday, right?

41:54.380 --> 41:56.380
Yeah. So it was like one.

41:56.380 --> 41:58.380
I was like, okay, I could drop below a little bit.

41:58.380 --> 41:59.380
Right. And then.

41:59.380 --> 42:01.380
And so I had so I had one deal that was going to be a new deal.

42:01.380 --> 42:04.380
So I was working on him. I had a business owner hooked.

42:04.380 --> 42:08.380
Then I decided to just cut the cut the fat with the other guy.

42:08.380 --> 42:13.380
And then, bam, Saturday morning, three business owners that I was like, she is broke.

42:13.380 --> 42:17.380
Okay. So so this is an important thing, guys.

42:17.380 --> 42:19.380
Well, soon as Porter lost the deal, he got right on it.

42:19.380 --> 42:22.380
He got pissed off instead of being like, oh, what was me?

42:22.380 --> 42:26.380
Oh, my. I'm a victim. Oh, oh, of course.

42:26.380 --> 42:30.380
The Porter, you know, guys, everyone's lost deals, dude.

42:30.380 --> 42:32.380
I lost a four thousand dollar deal at SeaWorld.

42:32.380 --> 42:34.380
And I was making eight grand a month.

42:34.380 --> 42:37.380
Like, dude, that's that's when you go.

42:37.380 --> 42:40.380
That's when you're like, yeah, I don't know about that churro.

42:40.380 --> 42:42.380
You can't tell that you can't tell wifey.

42:42.380 --> 42:43.380
You can't tell the kids they can't have the churro.

42:43.380 --> 42:45.380
But you're like, how am I going to pay for that?

42:45.380 --> 42:46.380
Pay for the churro.

42:46.380 --> 42:50.380
The churro is like eight bucks, dude, pretty pricey.

42:50.380 --> 42:51.380
We're going back for round two.

42:51.380 --> 42:52.380
You know what I'm saying?

42:53.380 --> 42:56.380
It goes a long way when you just lost a four thousand dollar client.

42:56.380 --> 42:58.380
Been there, bro.

42:58.380 --> 43:01.380
First and foremost, guys, you this is why you build assets.

43:01.380 --> 43:03.380
This is why you don't do you don't trade time for dollars.

43:03.380 --> 43:06.380
You build assets because now Porter's like, OK, screw you, Bob.

43:06.380 --> 43:08.380
Screw you. What's his name?

43:09.380 --> 43:10.380
Nestor, dude. Yeah.

43:10.380 --> 43:13.380
Screw you, Nestor. I feel like I had.

43:13.380 --> 43:14.380
I feel like I worked with a guy named Nestor.

43:14.380 --> 43:16.380
I think it was probably my old client.

43:16.380 --> 43:18.380
Screw you, Nestor. I'm going to go to somebody else.

43:18.380 --> 43:21.380
He just jumped on it. He used the pit.

43:21.380 --> 43:23.380
He was pissed off and he used it to go get a client.

43:23.380 --> 43:25.380
What did you do? Did you even have any leads to send?

43:25.380 --> 43:27.380
Did you like did you just start rip?

43:27.380 --> 43:30.380
Like did you have your old list or what was the first thing you did?

43:30.380 --> 43:32.380
You go lock yourself in your office. You go on a drive.

43:32.380 --> 43:33.380
How did you make the calls?

43:33.380 --> 43:35.380
So, yeah, dude, I do.

43:35.380 --> 43:38.380
So, dude, I could just rip calls in the truck, dude.

43:38.380 --> 43:43.380
So I just get in the V10, the gas log, dude, and I start trailing the farm roads, dude.

43:43.380 --> 43:47.380
And then I was taking these leads because this guy wasn't calling these leads because he was so booked out.

43:47.380 --> 43:49.380
So that was the one guy.

43:49.380 --> 43:53.380
So I was literally calling leads back like weeks and weeks.

43:53.380 --> 43:55.380
And some of these were like, yeah, I'd love a quote.

43:55.380 --> 44:00.380
So I sent over like two one day and then like I waited a little bit, sent another two.

44:00.380 --> 44:03.380
So it was fast. That one was to cake.

44:03.380 --> 44:05.380
And the other one, this one was a little bit slower.

44:05.380 --> 44:07.380
This one was Nestor, the one I got.

44:07.380 --> 44:10.380
So I called some of his leads that he had already quoted.

44:10.380 --> 44:14.380
And I was like, hey, like I work with a couple of different contractors, whatever, me and this other guy working together.

44:14.380 --> 44:18.380
But I could also send you another guy like I don't want to step on anyone's toes.

44:18.380 --> 44:21.380
But like I could give you another option. And they're like, yeah, send them over.

44:21.380 --> 44:27.380
So I sent them over the same lead and I let the business owner know because I didn't want him thinking I was giving this to two different guys.

44:27.380 --> 44:31.380
But I was like, you know, I was working with this other guy, whatever. He didn't have a problem with it.

44:31.380 --> 44:34.380
So anyways, that's what I was doing. But yeah, I was I just went in my truck, dude.

44:34.380 --> 44:38.380
I just was like, I got to go take a little breather. And I just and I had a list already.

44:38.380 --> 44:43.380
So I knew that like I had it already prepared because I think I hooked one of the guys like that first client I had.

44:43.380 --> 44:46.380
It was the first call I did. So I had this whole list ready.

44:46.380 --> 44:49.380
So I just went and started making calls right after.

44:49.380 --> 44:52.380
Dude, one one little hack, guys, is I agree.

44:52.380 --> 44:56.380
I definitely recommend you do your closing calls from your Zoom.

44:56.380 --> 45:04.380
But for some reason, getting in your car and driving around and doing calls, I think it's because you're not this is not safe.

45:04.380 --> 45:14.380
I'm not saying this is the top safety protocol here, but use your Bluetooth, whatever I get in the freaking Tesla, dude, just I recline that seat like I'm basically about to take a nap.

45:14.380 --> 45:17.380
And, dude, I got the thing on on the Bluetooth.

45:17.380 --> 45:25.380
And, dude, for some reason, being distracted and looking at the way I'm driving, I'm so much more calm like I'm not.

45:25.380 --> 45:27.380
Don't get me wrong. I'm still sweating.

45:27.380 --> 45:32.380
I'm still freaking pouring sweat down my back and my face when I'm calling, even doing it this long.

45:32.380 --> 45:40.380
Sometimes for some of you guys that are terrified, jump in your car, go on a drive and just take your list with you and call them while you're driving.

45:40.380 --> 45:41.380
Call them while you're walking.

45:41.380 --> 45:45.380
Try to distract yourself a little bit like that and it will help you a lot.

45:45.380 --> 45:46.380
Sometimes I get it when you're sitting at your desk.

45:46.380 --> 45:50.380
It's really nervous. You're sitting there taking your feet and you're like, I don't know.

45:50.380 --> 45:53.380
But if you're moving and doing something, it seems to help.

45:53.380 --> 45:57.380
So Porter, thank goodness he followed the process, right?

45:57.380 --> 45:58.380
He had the list already built.

45:58.380 --> 46:00.380
He knew who we wanted to contact.

46:00.380 --> 46:06.380
One thing that I like that you did, he went and called some of the old leads that he that the guy never quoted or the guy never closed.

46:06.380 --> 46:09.380
Whatever the guy's not paying him this this guy Nestor.

46:09.380 --> 46:11.380
So it's like he's not obligated to do anything.

46:11.380 --> 46:13.380
He went and called him and he hustled.

46:13.380 --> 46:16.380
He didn't say, well, I'm going to wait for some more leads to come in.

46:16.380 --> 46:17.380
He just went and called him.

46:17.380 --> 46:21.380
So how do you what's the pitch like to a business owner?

46:21.380 --> 46:23.380
You have somebody you know they're going to cancel.

46:23.380 --> 46:25.380
You can just see it.

46:25.380 --> 46:26.380
You can smell it, right?

46:26.380 --> 46:27.380
They missed a few payments.

46:27.380 --> 46:28.380
They're a little unhappy.

46:28.380 --> 46:30.380
You've got a Zoom scheduled next Thursday.

46:30.380 --> 46:32.380
They want to review things.

46:32.380 --> 46:33.380
You have a good feeling.

46:33.380 --> 46:35.380
You kind of know they're going to cancel at some point.

46:35.380 --> 46:38.380
How what do you say to the new when you're calling the new list?

46:38.380 --> 46:43.380
What do you say to the business owner that's different than when you don't have a business owner?

46:43.380 --> 46:49.380
I guess the only I guess I ask him different questions.

46:49.380 --> 46:56.380
I think it's like, OK, that business owner that I just lost, what is one quality that that they have that I didn't know they had?

46:56.380 --> 47:00.380
You know, when I started working with them, so I think I started I asked a little bit better questions.

47:01.380 --> 47:06.380
Like maybe it's like, hey, like I really started to focus on like, hey, how much you make and how long you've been a business.

47:06.380 --> 47:10.380
Like, I think that was his problem was he just wasn't making a lot of money.

47:10.380 --> 47:12.380
Like he wasn't he didn't have any source of lead flow.

47:12.380 --> 47:16.380
It was just me, which, yeah, you're fine with just doing this.

47:16.380 --> 47:21.380
But like most other guys have their own brand or mouth, all these different things.

47:21.380 --> 47:25.380
And so like one of the guys I quoted, dude, this is hilarious.

47:25.380 --> 47:30.380
I got on the phone with him and he I was like, hey, how much are you making like per month?

47:30.380 --> 47:33.380
And he's like, two. And I was like, like, two hundred thousand.

47:33.380 --> 47:36.380
He's like, no, two million. And then I was like, OK.

47:36.380 --> 47:42.380
And then he's like, hold on, give me one sec. And he walks out of his house and he's like, sorry, you mean my wife for going through divorce.

47:42.380 --> 47:45.380
I don't want her to see the numbers. I don't want to hear that.

47:45.380 --> 47:48.380
Somebody you're working with. Yeah, this is one of my clients, dude.

47:48.380 --> 47:51.380
He was hilarious. So dogs make it two mil.

47:51.380 --> 47:53.380
And you thought he was making way less. Yeah.

47:53.380 --> 47:57.380
And so I literally I was like, because you just don't know, like you talked to him on the phone.

47:57.380 --> 48:00.380
You're like, this guy is probably making a couple hundred thousand a year.

48:00.380 --> 48:02.380
Right. And this guy takes me outside.

48:02.380 --> 48:07.380
He's flexing all he's got, like, three fifties, like trailers, like everything.

48:07.380 --> 48:10.380
And so in my mind, I was like, dude, I think I'd get a little bit more.

48:10.380 --> 48:13.380
But I was like, I'm not going to be greedy. Like, this is what it's going to be worth.

48:13.380 --> 48:16.380
Right. And so I quoted him like fifteen hundred dollars.

48:16.380 --> 48:18.380
And, dude, he didn't even bat an eye. He's like, that sounds good.

48:18.380 --> 48:21.380
He's like, honestly, I probably won't even know what's coming out.

48:22.380 --> 48:25.380
That's awesome. Just got or somebody you got before.

48:25.380 --> 48:28.380
No, this is the client that I got Saturday.

48:28.380 --> 48:33.380
I love that. Guys, if you could ever get your business owners talking like that and they like to flex a little bit,

48:33.380 --> 48:36.380
let them flex, stroke the ego a little bit.

48:36.380 --> 48:40.380
And also, even though they're making a bunch of money, yeah, you might be able to charge them a little bit more.

48:40.380 --> 48:43.380
But also, I'm a big believer of leaving some meat on the bone.

48:43.380 --> 48:48.380
Charge a fair price because you could go back to that client and get the second, third, fourth, fifth deal.

48:48.380 --> 48:51.380
So really good things that I want to point out there.

48:51.380 --> 48:55.380
OK, Gina says we are getting deals. I love Gina's got a little pride.

48:55.380 --> 48:58.380
She's like, Nick, you're talking smack. I'm over here getting deals.

48:58.380 --> 49:02.380
She says we have deals in the works right now. We're on track for our quarter one goals.

49:02.380 --> 49:04.380
This is perfect timing because we do need to replace a business owner.

49:04.380 --> 49:06.380
We'll post some wins. I love it. Post some wins.

49:06.380 --> 49:10.380
I would love to hear about it, Gina. Sean Sean says Gina is super scrappy.

49:10.380 --> 49:14.380
I love that. Porter, get close to the mic.

49:14.380 --> 49:17.380
Well, that was a little late, but Porter, get close to the mic.

49:17.380 --> 49:20.380
I don't think you have. Porter, you need to get yourself a mic, dude.

49:20.380 --> 49:23.380
No, I know. You have those lights still that I gave you?

49:23.380 --> 49:25.380
Yeah, I got them. Are you using them right now?

49:25.380 --> 49:29.380
No, I haven't got them on.

49:29.380 --> 49:33.380
Get yourself a blue yeti. A hundred bucks, dude.

49:33.380 --> 49:35.380
Listen to this. This is awesome. Nick Kudlik.

49:35.380 --> 49:39.380
His warm network is what got me to $9,300 a month.

49:39.380 --> 49:42.380
Nick Kudlik is somebody you guys don't know because he doesn't post.

49:42.380 --> 49:45.380
Frickin' post, Nick, I want people to know about you.

49:45.380 --> 49:52.380
This dude's been just working his warm network and behind-the-scenes silent killer is at $9,300 a month.

49:52.380 --> 49:56.380
And I think he even lost the deal. I think he got over $10K just using his warm network.

49:56.380 --> 50:00.380
You have deals in your back pocket, guys. Go fricking hit them up.

50:00.380 --> 50:05.380
You guys know all the people with like the Mary Kay and the doTERRA and the Sensei and all these things.

50:05.380 --> 50:10.380
Dude, you got some of these housewives that are hustling harder than you guys.

50:10.380 --> 50:14.380
Frickin' running these shows, dude. Selling Tupperware, making more money than some of you guys.

50:14.380 --> 50:17.380
And you guys are actually selling something that can make them money, okay?

50:17.380 --> 50:22.380
Go get scrappy. I'm not saying to send a fricking Facebook post that says, hey, you'd be a great...

50:22.380 --> 50:26.380
No. Follow the process the best that you can, but you got people in your warm network.

50:26.380 --> 50:31.380
Okay, my mood. Agree, Porter. You got to hook a better B.O. immediately.

50:31.380 --> 50:33.380
Otherwise, your heartbreak will live in your head rent-free.

50:33.380 --> 50:36.380
A hundred percent. You got to take action quick. You got to use that...

50:36.380 --> 50:40.380
Guys, whenever I was on the doors and I would get a no, I would never take a break, dude.

50:40.380 --> 50:44.380
It was like next door. And I would take out all my anger on that door.

50:44.380 --> 50:49.380
And even if I didn't do anything, it was like I felt good because I was like, no, I own that door.

50:49.380 --> 50:54.380
They weren't interested. They weren't telling me, no, I fricking just boss that door, okay?

50:54.380 --> 50:58.380
Sean Sean said, Gina and I lost a $1,400 offense client yesterday, but we're not crying.

50:58.380 --> 51:01.380
The site brought 30 leads in January and over 30 leads this month.

51:01.380 --> 51:03.380
That deal is going to be awesome.

51:03.380 --> 51:07.380
I'm back on the phone today and excited that I will help another offense contractor make some serious money.

51:07.380 --> 51:12.380
Exactly. And that's the beautiful thing, guys, is you have assets that are paying you 30 leads a month, dude.

51:12.380 --> 51:17.380
That that's you could I think you guys could charge up with fencing 30 leads.

51:17.380 --> 51:21.380
That's a $2,000 a month deal. You guys can count it as a win.

51:21.380 --> 51:23.380
Get him under a six month contract. Good to go.

51:23.380 --> 51:26.380
Okay, Laura Shepard, Adair said, What's the book?

51:26.380 --> 51:31.380
Slide Edge. Read it. Do 10 pages a day. It's taking me about a month.

51:31.380 --> 51:35.380
I'll probably finish it this week. And it's phenomenal.

51:35.380 --> 51:39.380
Okay, Adair says I just lost a $3,000 a month deal from SEO.

51:39.380 --> 51:42.380
They hired in-house and let me go. Had that happen, my $4,000 a month.

51:42.380 --> 51:45.380
Same thing. They're like, yeah, I can pay somebody to bring them in-house.

51:45.380 --> 51:49.380
Okay, Porter, what's your what's your current status?

51:49.380 --> 51:51.380
You got another client on the hook?

51:51.380 --> 51:55.380
I got another one on the hook. I've sent him one lead so far.

51:55.380 --> 51:59.380
I kind of put him on the back burner just because I really want to replace these two clients.

51:59.380 --> 52:01.380
So he's still in the works. Message him.

52:01.380 --> 52:05.380
I told him, hey, it's not personal. I'm just busy this last week.

52:05.380 --> 52:08.380
So this week, as soon as I get some leads, going to pass them over, going to close them.

52:08.380 --> 52:14.380
Also, I will say I was nervous to get these people on the phone because one of these clients,

52:14.380 --> 52:19.380
the guy that was making $2,000 a year, I didn't feel like I'd send them enough leads.

52:19.380 --> 52:21.380
Like, you know, you ever get to that point where you're like, I don't know,

52:21.380 --> 52:26.380
because if you don't send them enough leads or you don't gain enough trust, they just won't.

52:26.380 --> 52:29.380
There'll be objection after objection. So I was nervous.

52:29.380 --> 52:33.380
But that Friday, I was like, and you had talked about, you're like, dude, you got to have deals on the weekend.

52:33.380 --> 52:36.380
I was like, dude, I'm just going to send it because if they're going to say no,

52:36.380 --> 52:40.380
I need to find somebody today and get something else rolling.

52:40.380 --> 52:42.380
So anyways, I'm really glad that I pushed that client.

52:42.380 --> 52:45.380
The other one, I'd send him really good leads. I was really confident in.

52:45.380 --> 52:48.380
But this one, I was like, I don't know, it could go either way.

52:48.380 --> 52:54.380
But I'm sure glad I did because I did send him enough leads and I felt like I communicated enough that he wanted that.

52:54.380 --> 52:58.380
So don't be afraid. Take imperfect action because, dude, it doesn't need to be perfect.

52:58.380 --> 52:59.380
Everybody's different.

52:59.380 --> 53:03.380
I love that. I've sent people one.

53:03.380 --> 53:06.380
There's people I've closed. I sent one lead.

53:06.380 --> 53:11.380
I sent one lead. They didn't even, not only did they not close it, they didn't even quote it.

53:11.380 --> 53:15.380
But that was enough. Guys, sometimes when you do this long enough, you start to feel it in your gut.

53:15.380 --> 53:18.380
You start hearing things they're saying. They're really friendly with you.

53:18.380 --> 53:20.380
They're talking about working together in the future.

53:20.380 --> 53:22.380
You kind of start to get these like little cues.

53:22.380 --> 53:25.380
You just got to go for it, even though you don't feel 100 percent confident.

53:26.380 --> 53:29.380
Sometimes one lead is all they needed because they might have done it without a lead.

53:29.380 --> 53:31.380
That was just the cherry on top.

53:31.380 --> 53:37.380
So, guys, in closing, because it's eight o'clock, it's eight o'clock MST and we've got to go make some money.

53:37.380 --> 53:41.380
I got 20 minutes with the kids and I'm back here for the next eight hours at this desk.

53:41.380 --> 53:45.380
Guys, if you have clients that are not paying you, don't accept it.

53:45.380 --> 53:48.380
Go find a new client. If you have clients that aren't paying you enough, don't accept it.

53:48.380 --> 53:51.380
If you've got clients that are freaking playing around with you, dancing around with you,

53:51.380 --> 53:56.380
remember that you guys are the ones that have the quote, you know, the golden rule quote.

53:56.380 --> 53:58.380
They say, do unto others.

53:58.380 --> 54:02.380
And then the real golden quote is like the person that has the gold makes the rules, right?

54:02.380 --> 54:05.380
You're the one that has the gold. You're the one that has the leads.

54:05.380 --> 54:08.380
They have cash. Yeah, but everybody has cash, right?

54:08.380 --> 54:11.380
Like everybody has cash. You can go work with somebody else.

54:11.380 --> 54:13.380
So, guys, don't accept it.

54:13.380 --> 54:17.380
Raise your standards of what you're willing to tolerate and raise your standards of how much money you need to make.

54:17.380 --> 54:20.380
So, guys, let's go make some money.

54:20.380 --> 54:22.380
That's it. See you next week.

54:22.380 --> 54:23.380
Yep. Bye.
