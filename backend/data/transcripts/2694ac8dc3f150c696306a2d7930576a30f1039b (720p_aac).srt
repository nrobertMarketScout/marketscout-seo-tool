1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
Website, running it out, lead generation.

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:03,840
Oh, there we go.

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:09,560
Recording started lead generation, building a website and ranking it is the

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:14,800
exact same skillset as having an SEO client who you build a website for and

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,480
do the SEO you don't own the website.

6
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:23,520
The client does, but in my mind, I wanted to make, you know, I wanted to make

7
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:29,200
lead gen work, but then I saw opportunities coming my way for easy wins.

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,360
And, you know, business owners, I knew connections I had, Hey, can you do my

9
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:39,680
website for me now that they knew I had that skillset and I was like, man, I

10
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,440
would way rather work for you than work for my job, right?

11
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,600
So I'm like, okay, I can do that.

12
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,600
And we structure a deal.

13
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:48,440
Okay.

14
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,480
500 bucks a month.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,560
I'll build you a new website and I won't charge you for the new website

16
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,440
build, even though it's a website development.

17
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:02,640
Like I can do it so well with employees worldwide, so cheap.

18
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,080
I can build a website for $40 is my cost.

19
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:10,840
I'll do that for free and you just pay me 500 bucks a month and you'll get the

20
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,280
website, you'll get the SEO work, you'll get everything.

21
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,160
And now I have these cash reserves.

22
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,360
And so once that clicked for me, I was like, wow, I just need to take those

23
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,200
easy wins and yeah, lead gen is awesome.

24
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,360
Keep building that, keep building those sites, keep ranking those things.

25
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,400
But I want to get out of my job ASAP.

26
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,440
And that's what clicked for me.

27
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,720
And I was like, okay, if I can do it once, you know, I bought this program,

28
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,960
um, your program and another program to learn.

29
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,760
And it took me like four months and I was grinding, grinding, making no money

30
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,880
until that first deal kind of came my way.

31
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,360
And I was like, okay, I have the skillset.

32
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,080
I'm going to do it.

33
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,800
And I took that first one.

34
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:55,600
And then I was like, wow, if I can just once the sites built and they're on,

35
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:59,520
it's just like mailbox money, 500 bucks a month, 500 bucks a month.

36
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,440
Um, and my team would just handle it.

37
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,160
And it was easy.

38
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:07,200
So I was like, man, if I can just stack those and get a hundred of those, get

39
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,840
150, get 200, that'll be life changing.

40
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,160
And that's exactly what happened.

41
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,520
So that's been the big breakthrough.

42
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:19,280
Like I think the main concept is like going from zero to one.

43
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:24,200
That's where people that are at jobs struggle with is getting the first client.

44
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:29,240
And so in my mind, I want to make getting the first client as easy as possible,

45
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,360
because once you have that first client, then the flood gets open because now the

46
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,120
pressure is on to deliver, to learn.

47
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,560
You'll learn way faster, get two, three, four, five, and your business will grow.

48
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,840
But you just got to go from zero to one.

49
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,040
So many people get stuck at that zero stage.

50
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,960
If you can get one, then you're rolling.

51
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,560
You're going.

52
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,160
So,

53
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:52,520
so the, the, the thing that is that Zach's kind of alluding to is that.

54
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,200
He was smart and he started targeting people.

55
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,240
And we're going to get into that a little bit, but he started targeting people who

56
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,720
already were paying for SEO services.

57
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,600
He wasn't going in.

58
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,800
My problem was I was trying to sell everyone SEO.

59
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,280
I was trying to sell the water bottle company, the restaurant, you know,

60
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,000
cause everyone technically could benefit from SEO, right?

61
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,600
Every single company, the Kleenex brand, everyone can benefit from SEO.

62
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,640
And I was trying to go and sell people on SEO and on why they should use me.

63
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,320
And Zach realized there's a subset of the market out there that are already paying

64
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:30,560
300, 500, $700 a month, and all he's got to do is switch them over to his service.

65
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,080
Give them a much pre, a much more premium service for the same price, or

66
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,560
even a little bit less, and dude, these people are set it and forget it.

67
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,480
These people are going to be paying this bill forever.

68
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:47,840
So, uh, Zach, how does somebody go from the zero to one?

69
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Like, let's just use an example, um, Killpot 5000.

70
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm not sure what your real name is, but let's just say Killpot's sitting in a

71
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,720
nine to five job and is tired of freaking trading their time for dollars,

72
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,840
waking up, punching the clock, barely making it work, not able to go to the

73
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,080
gym because they're tired, coming back depressed, no money, no, nothing's

74
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:15,080
exciting about their situation and they want to go and they want to make that

75
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,120
first deal.

76
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,400
How does somebody go from zero to one if they want to start today?

77
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,640
Awesome question.

78
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,960
When I started, I thought, what is the lowest hanging fruit?

79
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,360
What is the easiest sale?

80
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,600
And it's through your network.

81
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:36,240
So any business owner that you know, you just, you don't want to go in pitching,

82
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,360
but you want to just go and ask him questions.

83
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,680
You want to learn, you want to ask him questions.

84
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,760
Hey, how's your business doing?

85
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,080
How are you guys doing online?

86
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,160
How do you like your website?

87
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,960
How are you guys ranking?

88
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,440
What would you like to do better online?

89
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,840
And you just start the discussion and they'll just be honest with you

90
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,800
because they trust you.

91
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,840
So you have your network, but then a step further is anybody, you know,

92
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,400
that knows a business owner.

93
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,040
So then once I talked to someone, I'd be like, awesome.

94
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,120
Yeah.

95
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:05,120
Do you know any other business owners I could talk to that might be

96
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,320
wanting to grow their business?

97
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:11,600
And of course, tons and tons of business owners want to grow their business.

98
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,360
So if you just work your network, you can usually get anywhere from

99
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,800
three to 10 deals right there.

100
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,240
And those initial deals are really important because it'll build your

101
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,360
confidence and you can go from there.

102
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:29,880
Once you've kind of worked your immediate network, their network, then

103
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:36,000
it's like just people around you in your, in your city, in your neighborhood,

104
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,760
business owners that where it's easy, like, Hey, yeah, I live right down the street.

105
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,800
You know, I'm in, I live in queen Creek, Arizona.

106
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,680
I'm like, yeah, I'm right here in queen Creek.

107
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,280
Um, I'd love to just, you know, kind of talk to you about your

108
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,040
business a little bit, like, how are you guys doing?

109
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,920
And since you have a tie to them, you have a connection.

110
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,600
It's an easy conversation starter.

111
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:02,400
Um, especially when you're new, people get nervous, but essentially if you're

112
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,520
able to get someone to open up and you ask these questions I'm talking about,

113
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,480
they open up and then you just say, Oh, cool.

114
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,040
You want to do this thing.

115
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,800
I actually have the skills to do that thing.

116
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,760
How much are you currently paying for your current thing that you're getting

117
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,640
now for your website, for your SEO?

118
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,920
Oh, 300 bucks a month.

119
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:23,720
Awesome.

120
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,480
I'll do it for that same price and I'll give you way better service.

121
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,920
And I'm here local and you know, list goes on and on and I'm a small business

122
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,960
instead of that big company that you're with.

123
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:39,240
So those are some initial thoughts for dual from zero to one network, their

124
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,480
network, people in your neighborhood, and then just calling businesses.

125
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,040
Like you got to put in the reps.

126
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,880
So if you have zero clients and you're trying to get the first one, talk with

127
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,400
five business owners every day.

128
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:57,080
And that consistency will get you one client, two clients, you'll get better

129
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,440
at it, three clients, four clients, and it'll start building and that momentum

130
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,560
will just carry you forward.

131
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,840
So that's kind of what I'd say to go from zero to one.

132
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,520
So that's what I did.

133
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:11,200
Did you just make a list of all like being pretty practical here on steps?

134
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,000
Did you just sit there and go, okay, here's all the people that I know that

135
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,920
are owned businesses and then let me send them a message.

136
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,720
Let me call them.

137
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,560
Like, what was that?

138
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,680
What would that look like?

139
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,680
Was it just like, here's every single person that owns a business in

140
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,280
general or these types of businesses?

141
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,520
Or how did you, did you just compile a list?

142
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,720
Great question.

143
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,320
I literally pulled up a Google sheet with my free Gmail, pulled up a Google

144
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:40,440
sheet and I wanted business owners that were like service businesses, which I

145
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,360
don't really know many other business owners that aren't like providing a

146
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:48,400
service, maybe there's like an e-commerce business, I wouldn't focus on that.

147
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,440
Maybe there's manufacturing, wouldn't do that.

148
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,800
But most business owners that, you know, in your neighborhood are going to be

149
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,120
small business owners and that those are great people to talk to.

150
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,640
So I just pulled up a Google sheet and I just started writing names,

151
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,600
just brainstorming.

152
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,040
Once I ran out of names, I pulled up my phone and I just started slowly going

153
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,560
through the hundreds of contacts in my phone and adding somebody, adding

154
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,720
somebody, adding somebody.

155
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,080
And that was my simple first, like CRM to track what was going on with everybody.

156
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:17,680
Right.

157
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,480
So the first column was everybody's name.

158
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,440
And then I went through my Facebook friends and I went through the

159
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:28,480
whatever and got my list and maybe I have 20 to 30 people and I'm, it

160
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:32,360
doesn't sound like many, but you start talking to them and you start realizing

161
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:36,960
there's all these needs, all these unmet needs and people are generally

162
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,720
unsatisfied with who they've worked with.

163
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:46,160
Generally big marketing companies don't do a good job and don't care enough

164
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,880
about each individual client.

165
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,960
And so people are usually upset when they see a client that they don't

166
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,600
usually upset, which makes an easy, easy sale to slide in and help them out.

167
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,160
Or people don't understand things.

168
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,160
So if you just have the knowledge and just teach people, um, they will kind

169
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,000
of come to you as the expert, Hey, yeah, even if you don't work with me, I

170
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,320
would recommend doing this, this, and this, um, you can do it on your own.

171
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,680
I can help you do it and you can pay me to do it for you.

172
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,040
Like, and that's the conversation that's get started.

173
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:23,520
So I think like simple scales, the more simple you can make it, especially in

174
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:27,040
the beginning, the more you're going to scale if you overcomplicate it and you

175
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,560
start worrying about like, Oh shoot, how am I going to do, um, blog posts and

176
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,960
back linking and all this complicated stuff is like, who cares?

177
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,800
You don't have a client.

178
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,800
Just make a very simple list.

179
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,720
Start talking to those people.

180
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:44,960
If you don't know the answers, pull up chat GPT and type in, Hey, what do I do

181
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,280
here?

182
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,880
And you can tell the person, Hey, yeah, that's a great question.

183
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,440
I've actually haven't come across.

184
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,160
So before, let me look it up real quick, figure it out.

185
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:54,920
And you're like, okay.

186
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,600
And live while you're talking to them, you're solving their problems and

187
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,000
showing that you want to work with them.

188
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,200
So I think just keep it really simple, build the list, use free works

189
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,840
resources like Google sheets.

190
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,440
And now, you know, you have the names, then you have your notes in the next

191
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:13,320
column, this date, talk to them, make sure to call them again on Friday.

192
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:13,800
Right.

193
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,520
It's so basic, but that's why it's effective because you actually use it.

194
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,920
So that's how I got started.

195
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,920
Did you find that a lot of the people that you were reaching out to on your

196
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:26,440
list were already paying for a similar type of service?

197
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:31,080
They were paying somebody to host their website or were you basically, you

198
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:35,360
know, having to, to get them to pay you something they weren't already paying?

199
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,720
Awesome question.

200
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:46,400
Um, almost everyone was paying for their website and is it's pretty rare for a

201
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:52,000
business owner and an electrician, a plumber, a carpet cleaner to build their

202
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,320
own website, it just takes too much time.

203
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,320
Like they don't, they're focused on making money, doing plumbing, doing

204
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,000
carpet, me doing whatever their thing is.

205
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,400
And they don't think about it.

206
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:08,120
When I, I, it always comes back to me to, in college, when I did sales, I

207
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,400
sold door to door selling direct TV.

208
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,920
And it was so hard.

209
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,360
It was a gnarly experience.

210
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,400
Like I was in Houston in the summer.

211
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,600
It's like 105 degrees and humid.

212
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,240
I'm just sweating like crazy.

213
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,120
But in a hundred days, it was like a three month summer.

214
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,040
I made $70,000 as a college kid.

215
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,680
And I don't watch TV.

216
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,680
Like I don't care about TV.

217
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,640
It's it's I've never really cared about TV.

218
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,080
And so you're like, man, how, how was that even possible?

219
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,160
I didn't believe in the TV.

220
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,480
What I believed in was saving people money.

221
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,400
And I could save people money by switching them from dish network or

222
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,840
AT&T, you verse to direct TV.

223
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,680
And that switch was so easy.

224
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,600
If they were paying $150 a month, I could get them all the same channels

225
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,520
plus NFL Sunday ticket for $70 a month.

226
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,840
So less than half the price.

227
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:08,920
And they get every single football game the next fall and they get all the

228
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,440
channels, right?

229
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,760
So that switch was so easy.

230
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,720
And that summer in a hundred days, I did 300 switches and made $70,000.

231
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:22,200
So when I was learning Legion and learning websites and learning SEO, it

232
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,720
kind of clicked all of a sudden.

233
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:28,200
And I was like, Whoa, how could I get people that are already paying for

234
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:33,080
this to just switch to me and I can give them more channels and NFL Sunday

235
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,200
ticket, right?

236
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:39,440
I was like, okay, I'm just going to find the people that are paying 300, 500,

237
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,520
700 bucks a month, a thousand, whatever they're paying and match their

238
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,600
bit and over deliver on the services.

239
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,800
So, okay, you're paying $500 a month for your website and SEO.

240
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,160
I'll do 500 bucks a month for your website and SEO.

241
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,080
And I'll also help you with a Google review strategy and make you a custom

242
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:05,040
link you can use, and you can call me anytime I'm way more accessible.

243
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,880
And we actually write high quality content, you know, like all these things.

244
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,320
They're like, Oh yeah, that's a no brainer.

245
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,600
And when you're starting out, it's a no brainer for them.

246
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,200
It's, it's no additional money.

247
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:21,120
But for you, you just went from zero to making 500 bucks a month with one

248
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,160
client, and that is a huge game changer.

249
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,960
That's what I love seeing and love helping people do is like go from that

250
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:31,560
zero to 500 to a thousand to 10,000.

251
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:35,080
And when you hit 10,000 months, recurring revenue, most people are

252
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:38,000
basically free to quit their job and just scale.

253
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,520
And it's so fun to, to a lot to happen and help people do that.

254
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:41,880
So,

255
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:47,360
so for those that just jumped on, for those that aren't following, basically

256
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:53,200
the strategy from a high level is using SEO, which is taking people's websites,

257
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:57,920
ranking them on Google, you are going to go to your contact list, the people

258
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,040
that you know, your warm network, especially, and specifically the home

259
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:06,560
service businesses, you're going to go in with a wit, like it, with the mindset

260
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,160
of I'm going to add value, I'm going to help, I'm going to see how I can add

261
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:12,280
value and sure, if they want to pay me great, if not, I'm still going to be

262
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,120
that person that's like adding value.

263
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:18,120
You go in most likely, you're going to be able to offer them the exact same

264
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:22,000
thing, plus one or two additional things, more value for the same price or less.

265
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:27,360
And doing that strategy, you're going to be able to stack your first one, two,

266
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,280
three, four, five, 10 clients.

267
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:34,360
That's from a, from like, uh, that's a very simple, simplified way to say it,

268
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,000
but that's essentially what strategy is.

269
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,400
Right.

270
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,200
Yeah.

271
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,320
And then you just, um, always are improving that.

272
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,080
So once you have a couple of clients and you're like, Whoa, these switches are

273
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:52,680
easy, you start hearing more names of like, Oh, wow, this big marketing

274
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,000
company does a terrible job.

275
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,520
These people do a bad job.

276
00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:01,640
This software is expensive and I can, you know, pull clients or cross sell.

277
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,760
You know, they could have that software and use me for their site.

278
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:11,480
Um, and you start, you know, getting lists and like attacking easy went.

279
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:16,920
And that's how I just really start snowballing is you're like, wow, I can

280
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:21,720
just hone in on exactly who I want to target for some people it's, it's

281
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,720
niches like, Ooh, I'm, I'm really good with carpet cleaners because my dad owns

282
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,320
a carpet cleaning company, I'm going to focus on carpet cleaners.

283
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,800
I can speak their language or other people, you know, find a company.

284
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,520
This big marketing company is terrible.

285
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,840
No one likes them.

286
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,840
They have terrible reviews.

287
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,200
I'm just going to pull people over.

288
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:44,360
Um, and so figuring out those strategies has been huge.

289
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,240
Yeah.

290
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,800
So the, the initial few clients is just hitting your network.

291
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,240
And then from there, you've got to have a bigger strategy.

292
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,080
That's something that you can, you could turn into a system.

293
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,160
And that's what Zach, the reason that Zach's been able to get to $56,000 per

294
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,160
month is not because he's got a network with that many people, but his initial

295
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,080
clients in that, I think you're right, dude, it's the same thing with digital

296
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:05,880
real estate, right?

297
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,960
Going from zero to one gives you all the confidence in the world to, Oh my

298
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,560
gosh, this is actually going to work.

299
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,800
And then the second deal becomes easier.

300
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,520
And the third deal and the fourth deal and the fifth deal.

301
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,920
And so guys, the reason why.

302
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:26,280
I didn't do SEO correctly is first and foremost, I was targeting big juicy

303
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,960
retainers because that's what I like to do with digital real estate.

304
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,880
I like to get thousand 1500.

305
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,640
I had a client, an SEO client.

306
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,160
It was paying me $4,000 per month.

307
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:39,440
And honestly, that was the same client that caused me to stop doing SEO.

308
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:44,200
Because while I was on vacation, that same individual called me and canceled

309
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:49,440
and it like completely just ruined my vacation because it took like 40% of

310
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,840
my 40 or probably like 50% of my revenue at that point.

311
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,800
And what Zach does is he goes in strategically and goes to people that

312
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:01,440
are already comfortable paying a small micro bill and they have been, and

313
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,600
he's just switching them over.

314
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,080
Instead of selling someone on this new concept, he's taking people that are

315
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:09,880
already paying in general and just funneling that money into himself.

316
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:10,200
Yeah.

317
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,400
He does a little bit of work upfront.

318
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,200
And then after that, a lot of it set it and forget it.

319
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,920
The second thing that he did really well, it's genius.

320
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,800
And if you guys are like, man, this might distract me guys.

321
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:24,280
If you do what Zach's doing, which is targeting home service businesses, you

322
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:28,400
can literally go target your future digital real estate clients.

323
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,880
Like you could go in and say, Hey, I'm only going to target clients in tree

324
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:35,600
service or concrete or spray foam insulation, and I'm going to go get their

325
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,800
SEO, get in the door with their SEO at 500 bucks a month.

326
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:39,720
And guess what?

327
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,360
The only reason they want SEO is because they want leads.

328
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,920
So now I got their trust.

329
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,760
Now I'm going to take some of that money.

330
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:50,480
I'm going to go set up a strategy using what Nick talks about, put up a landing

331
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:55,280
page to put an ad up, run some ads, get them additional leads and say, Hey, Mr.

332
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,360
business owner, what do you think about buying these leads from my project as

333
00:17:59,360 --> 00:17:59,840
well?

334
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,120
And now all of a sudden you have people that already trust you and it's the

335
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,320
easiest sell in the world to go for that second, third, fourth money.

336
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,360
So I wish I had done this.

337
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,600
I was an idiot.

338
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,160
I was literally taking, I had a.

339
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:15,840
A client that had a restaurant, a Mexican restaurant.

340
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,560
I had a client that did like wedding performances, like wedding bands, like

341
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,800
they would go and do like the, they like that type of a thing.

342
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,960
Great clients by the way, but they just, I was so spread out, dude.

343
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:32,800
And then I had like this foundation repair client that I had, uh, what else

344
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,680
did I even have at the time?

345
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,960
I had so many different things.

346
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,840
I didn't know how to speak the language and guys, all these people did not have

347
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,720
SEO, so I was a bill, right?

348
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,920
Zach's going in and he's like, look, you already have a bill.

349
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,680
Let me just, you just pay it to me instead.

350
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,200
I'm going to give you a way superior service.

351
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,560
And by the way, Zach, it's funny because I did door to door.

352
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:57,000
I sold home security systems, not direct TV, but I had the exact same strategy

353
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,360
is I realized really early on, dude, just go target the people that are already

354
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:05,800
paying the whoever sold them the security the first time they did the hard work.

355
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,040
They convinced them that they needed the bill.

356
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,040
Now I just got to show them that my product, my offering is a better

357
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:17,640
offering than theirs, simple, easy sale, no emotion, 20 minutes in and out.

358
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,520
Boom, boom, boom.

359
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,120
And I just made my commission.

360
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:25,120
So, um, the beautiful thing about SEO, the beautiful thing about lead gen is

361
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,000
that it's recurring, right?

362
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,360
You get paid again and again and again.

363
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,280
And Zach, I don't even think you've even gone and cashed in yet and went and

364
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,600
sold the, the lead gen on the backend.

365
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:40,280
But when you do, I think you're going to increase your revenue 10 to $20,000

366
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,760
overnight, because you probably are sitting on, uh, I don't know how many

367
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,640
clients and projects that you could go and sell, but I know you have such a

368
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,480
good system right now.

369
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:51,080
You're like, let me just keep, keep adding these on, but, um, let's talk

370
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,040
about your business really quick.

371
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:56,080
How many, how many clients is your $56,000 made up of?

372
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:01,000
Um, we have like 170 clients.

373
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:05,760
So your average clients between like, what, about three to 400 bucks?

374
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,920
Three, three to 400 bucks.

375
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:13,400
And a lot of them honestly, um, just stay forever.

376
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:17,200
So if you look at like the lifetime value of a client, it's like over

377
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:23,120
five, six, 7,000, because they just stay and pay that for so long.

378
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:29,600
And like the clients that we lose over time, some people like will retire or

379
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:34,440
like things like that or some, you know, it's like, it's like, Oh, are you

380
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,600
going to like give your company to your son?

381
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,120
One guy is actually, Hey, I'm retiring.

382
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,120
And he's like, Oh, actually I'm going to give my business to my son.

383
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,880
But now we still have him as a client.

384
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,920
And he was just like, goes and goes and goes.

385
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:52,880
And so over time, it's pretty crazy to see how like an easy sale and a system

386
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:56,600
where it's just like, my team just takes care of these people and does their stuff.

387
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,000
Very easy to set up that team.

388
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,400
And now I never think about it.

389
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,640
I never have a call.

390
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,960
They don't have my phone number.

391
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:08,280
They, they can email our support line or email my support team.

392
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,720
And I don't even know when we lose clients anymore or get them.

393
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,840
It's like, it's just so fractional small that we just keep adding them.

394
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,320
And then here and there, someone retires, whatever happens.

395
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:19,520
Right.

396
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,760
But there's not the stress.

397
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,840
There's the complete freedom of like the systems are going really well.

398
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,480
And now I just think about the big picture stuff.

399
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,520
How can I hire someone really cool to do this thing?

400
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:35,280
How can I think of a new strategy for sales?

401
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,360
And then my sales team does it.

402
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:43,880
So it's been very, very fun to grow it and then just plug people in that are

403
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,200
phenomenal at building websites, phenomenal at whatever they do and, and

404
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:52,120
just watch it compound over time since people are so sticky and stay so long.

405
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:52,960
It's really cool.

406
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,720
Yeah, that's dope, dude.

407
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,560
And you know what?

408
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:59,360
I used to hate the idea of having a ton of clients like that, but what I love

409
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:04,160
about having 150 clients is you have a business that's built brick by brick by

410
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:10,280
brick that you literally placed each one and it took a while to build, but it's

411
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,080
not going to crumble overnight, right?

412
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:16,520
You don't have one huge client that's like literally got you by the fricking

413
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,720
throat that's saying like, Hey, you better give me a better price or I'm going to

414
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:24,320
quit, dude, you could lose five clients tomorrow and you really wouldn't actually

415
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:24,800
feel it.

416
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,720
You know what I'm saying?

417
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,440
So that's, I like that strategy a lot.

418
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:31,760
The other reason I like it is because again, dude, when you decide to monetize

419
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:36,320
on the backend and you go and sell them lead generation, dude, if you can get 10%

420
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:41,360
of those people at a thousand dollars a month, you know, 15% of those people,

421
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,360
you're just increasing five, $10,000 per month right there.

422
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,160
You know what I'm saying?

423
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:46,440
Yeah.

424
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:51,720
And the thing is like, I already know which people are perfect because there's

425
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:55,600
trust there and they come to us and say, Hey, we want more leads.

426
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,760
We want to run ads or do whatever.

427
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,480
It's like, that's an inbound lead to sell.

428
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:06,520
So you're perfectly positioned to do that.

429
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,480
For sure.

430
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:15,200
So tell everyone real quick, because dude, one thing that I realized when I started

431
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:19,920
doing this, you know, my, my dream was like, dude, I want to become a millionaire

432
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,600
by, you know, 30 years old.

433
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,160
I think that's such a cliche answer.

434
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,760
Everybody has, but that was me.

435
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,440
I've been writing that down in my little journal since I was 18.

436
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,080
And, and then when I hit it, it was like, okay, let's go bigger.

437
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:32,840
Let's go bigger.

438
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,160
And I've always like, I, then it's like, I want to be, I want to get

439
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,000
a million dollars a month.

440
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,520
Like that's, you know, the goal.

441
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,520
And I thought like, and I was always speaking to this and dude, it was literally

442
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:46,800
like a couple of weeks ago, I did a poll and I did it on here.

443
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,480
I did it in the Facebook group.

444
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,440
I did it to my digital landlords community.

445
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:53,600
And I just asked everyone like, what do you guys want?

446
00:23:54,080 --> 00:24:01,680
And I put some options and it was like, uh, security, respect, um, whatever.

447
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:06,120
And then somebody, I didn't even put this and somebody added freedom.

448
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,600
And dude, everybody wanted that answer.

449
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,440
And so I started like thinking about it and I was like, you know what?

450
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:17,320
I think that like all that people want is they want to be able to make enough

451
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:23,880
money to be free from their freaking job and from what they're doing right now

452
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,920
and to go and do what they like to do.

453
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:30,600
And so Zach, I want you to tell everyone, like what, when you started, tell

454
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,360
everyone what, how your life was.

455
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,400
The job that you had, what your schedule was like.

456
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:38,400
And then I want you to tell everyone, like, and I know you're very humble, so

457
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,520
you would never say much, but like, tell everyone, like some of the cool stuff

458
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:46,800
you've done over the past in 2024, cause you're getting as bad as me, dude.

459
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:50,200
Every time I call you or text you, you're in some other country surfing

460
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,120
or something like that.

461
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:55,040
So, but yeah, tell it really, we're kind of going backwards, but tell everyone

462
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:00,680
your story as far as like where you were a couple of years ago, when you were

463
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:05,000
still in the J O B and then tell everyone like what this year's looked like for you.

464
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:12,840
Yeah, that is pretty interesting to think about that contrast and go back and

465
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,920
enter that space of like December, 2021.

466
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,160
Um, I still had a job.

467
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:26,240
It was a sales job and, um, our manager, new manager was like, okay, you got to

468
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,800
make a hundred cold calls a day because we don't have enough leads coming in.

469
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:35,560
When I was just used to like closing deals and I was like, Whoa, wait a

470
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,800
second, that's crazy.

471
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,320
And I had a conversation with my wife.

472
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,760
I was like, I really, really don't want to do this.

473
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:51,120
If I'm going to call a hundred people a day to sell this software that the

474
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,400
software company I was working for, if I'm going to do that, why don't I just

475
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:57,360
call a hundred people a day for my own company?

476
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,960
And I quickly was like, get me out of here.

477
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:05,280
Like I'm hustling so hard building someone else's dream.

478
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,800
It was a cool software, but I'm not, I don't truly care about it.

479
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,080
Right.

480
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:12,560
What I care about is helping small business owners like my dad that are

481
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,720
target cleaners and small businesses succeed.

482
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,120
So that was my mindset.

483
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,520
And I was like, I have to get out of here ASAP.

484
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:24,400
So, um, you know, it was like, it was like the handcuffs, like you had to, like,

485
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,800
there was like check-in meeting 8 AM, check out 5 PM.

486
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,840
Like it was remote.

487
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,800
I was in my house, but it was like, it was like handcuffs.

488
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,440
You had to like be on and your calls were being tracked.

489
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,960
And I was just like, Whoa, this is the new manager came in and it was

490
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,600
intense tons of calls to make every day.

491
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:47,120
And then like, you know, everyone in the company ranked and just,

492
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,680
just pretty intense stuff.

493
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,200
And I was like, it was just heavy.

494
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:56,440
And so then once I committed, I was like, my wife supported me and we're like,

495
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:59,360
okay, I'll just like grind and hustle and build my own thing.

496
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:05,000
What I did more and more over time is just essentially buying back my time.

497
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:09,160
You know, most people, when you're working for income, you're

498
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,480
trading your time for money.

499
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,760
Um, once I owned my own company, I was making more money.

500
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,720
I could trade my money for time.

501
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,400
I could employ people.

502
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,880
I could pay somebody and now they take care of all that work.

503
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,840
And I would buy myself back my time.

504
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:30,240
And so I just kept doing that month after month after month to now this year.

505
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:36,640
Um, I mean, last year, beginning of 2023, I was still closing deals.

506
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,160
Um, and then I was like, okay, I've hit a point.

507
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,720
I no longer need to close deals for my company.

508
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,320
And I hired a salesperson.

509
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:50,200
I hired a customer support, hired an SEO team, hired, um, SDRs like.

510
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,960
I hired everybody website builders and you know, it was, it was step by step.

511
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:58,640
And then the last couple of key hires were like a salesman

512
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,000
to completely take over sales and the sales team.

513
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,920
And now that I have a sales team in place, all the systems in place,

514
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:11,320
all the fulfillment in place, essentially, um, my day to day is.

515
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,360
I could honestly do whatever I want whenever I want.

516
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,360
I enjoy working and adding value.

517
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:22,720
So like I still work and I, I love training my team, helping them up skill.

518
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:28,040
I love hiring new people, um, going after new ideas and basically just

519
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,080
leading the team to crush it.

520
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,520
And that's what I'm all about.

521
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,800
Now is just helping people grow, helping other businesses grow.

522
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:39,960
Um, but yeah, like this year I went, it was kind of the last second thing.

523
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:45,800
Some buddies were going to Nicaragua on a surf trip and they were like, um,

524
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:49,280
they had their crew set, then someone dropped out and they're like, man,

525
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,280
who could go last second?

526
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,000
They called me and I'm like, yeah, I'm in.

527
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,240
So then I just can all of a sudden pick up and go to Nicaragua.

528
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,680
And it was epic.

529
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:01,560
Like we just were in Nicaragua on the beach would swim out with our surfboards

530
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:05,200
to a boat and the boat would drop drive up and down the coastline to the different

531
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:05,840
surf spots.

532
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:09,840
And we would just surf these different breaks that were incredible along the

533
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,440
cliffs in Nicaragua.

534
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,240
So that was, that was a fun trip.

535
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:18,240
We went to Hawaii for like over a month and got an Airbnb on the beach.

536
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:23,320
So our kids every day, we just wake up and walk out to the sand for a month.

537
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:26,440
Like that was pretty life changing.

538
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:32,080
Um, but I still feel like I was adding value because I was on the beach in

539
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,000
Hawaii or I was in the house and I was reading good books, you know,

540
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,120
and my kids is taking a nap.

541
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,600
I'm reading a good book.

542
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,040
And then I'm like, whoa, I'm just the idea guy now.

543
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:43,720
So I get this idea and boom, I just train, train the team, teach the team and

544
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,280
they, they take care of it.

545
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:51,760
So the super fun spot to be, um, when you say freedom, that's what everybody wants.

546
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,160
That's what I feel like this business model allows.

547
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,840
Yes, you need to grind.

548
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:02,040
You need to like hustle and get the first client, get that confidence, help those

549
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:08,200
stack, but there is a huge piece of mind knowing you have over a hundred clients,

550
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,160
plenty of money, plenty of savings, a team that's totally capable that you've

551
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:17,280
trained and now you can kind of do what you want with your day to day.

552
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:23,520
And one of the things that lights me up, like I have new goals now, like my

553
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:29,920
lifetime vision, my 25 year goal is to help thousands of business owners grow

554
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,920
their businesses and grow as people.

555
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,280
So that's what I'm all about is just helping other businesses grow,

556
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,720
helping other people grow.

557
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:41,000
And so I love studying self-improvement business growth.

558
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:45,120
And that's what I do now is just basically coach my team and then coach other

559
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,000
business owners on how to grow fast.

560
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,160
And it's so fulfilling.

561
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:49,640
I love it.

562
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:53,120
So that's kind of been a long answer to what this year's looked like for me,

563
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,720
but it's been an amazing year.

564
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,120
And when you were doing the job, you were making, I think I remember it was

565
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,400
like, what was it after taxes?

566
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,400
What was your take home?

567
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,280
I would take home each month 4,600.

568
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:11,520
I had like a 70,000 a year salary, but after taxes, you have 4,600 a month.

569
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,160
$4,600 a month, dude.

570
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:19,920
Um, can you imagine like now that you've experienced making $56,000 a month,

571
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:26,720
dude, I do not know, and this is all due respect, but like, I don't know how

572
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,400
people can live on less than like 15.

573
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,680
Like, obviously I do.

574
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:36,800
You cut the stupid stuff, but like when you're used to like not checking prices

575
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:41,120
at the grocery store or on the menu and stuff, like it's, it's, it's mind blog.

576
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:46,400
I don't know how at 4,600 bucks a month in 2024, how in the world people with it,

577
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:51,520
with kids, with a spouse, dude, I couldn't even live on that single, bro.

578
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,520
You know what I mean?

579
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:55,440
Like it's, it's, it's bananas, dude.

580
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,360
So, um, it's crazy.

581
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:02,800
What I'm getting at is it's crazy that you're just at your six months away,

582
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:08,000
six months away at any time from like completely buying your freedom or

583
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,360
completely getting your freedom.

584
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:14,360
And dude, there is nothing better than like, I always say this.

585
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,600
It's like when your mom asks you to clean your room, it sucks.

586
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,160
It sucked when you're a kid, right?

587
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,760
My mom doesn't ask me to clean my room anymore.

588
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,320
Thank goodness.

589
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:25,360
I have, I, I, I do that myself or I pay somebody to do that.

590
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:29,480
But when you, as a kid would go and like, Hey, I'm going to surprise my mom

591
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,720
and just clean my room on my own, dude.

592
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,880
It was amazing, right?

593
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,160
You've got the, the energy.

594
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:34,960
It's just like work.

595
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:39,560
Like even though you and I don't have to work, I still wake up, dude, it's

596
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:43,640
seven AM in Dubai, like I should probably be on a boat, you know?

597
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:49,000
Uh, but I, I, I'm choosing to work and I don't have to work, but I enjoy it.

598
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,480
And I like to build and I like to see that.

599
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:55,240
But so when you're doing it because you want to, it's so much more fulfilling.

600
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,160
You have energy to do it.

601
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,560
So I know it's just like, when you're in a job and you have to go, dude,

602
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:03,000
it freaking sucks, it freaking sucks.

603
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:08,840
Um, like for example, uh, uh, Jersey shore devil, he actually just joined

604
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,040
our digital landlords program.

605
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:10,840
We were talking about this.

606
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,960
He's, he does furniture sales and he's like, he makes really good money, but

607
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:19,960
he has to travel to different locations and he has to go and he'd be, he said

608
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:23,640
he would be in like Columbia and he would have to come and do it.

609
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,600
And like, so we talked about this exact same thing.

610
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:31,840
So, um, anyway, dude, it's, uh, the, the exciting part is for anyone listening

611
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:37,520
right now, you are, I would say if you would put your head down, turn off the

612
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:41,600
distractions, quit, get in quick, like chase and all this different stuff,

613
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:47,080
pick one thing and do it for a solid six months, six months.

614
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,240
I think that anyone in this stream could become free.

615
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:54,560
Some people sooner, some people it's going to take them longer to learn.

616
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:59,360
But I think six months is not unrealistic to think that by June, by

617
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:04,480
mid summer of next year, not even by June, by May, by April, end of April,

618
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:09,440
by freaking April fool's day, you could, you could completely have a different

619
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,320
life or you don't have to answer to a boss.

620
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:15,160
And then like there's a clear path that we're giving you guys.

621
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:22,160
So anyway, um, dude, killer killer, uh, training today, bro.

622
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:24,880
Hopefully this inspires some people, hopefully gives us some ideas.

623
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:29,320
Again, guys, the business model of digital real estate is building

624
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:32,560
sites, ranking them on Google with SEO.

625
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,800
And then renting out the leads.

626
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:38,440
So what Zach's doing is he picked one part of the process.

627
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,280
He's just focusing on the SEO.

628
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,600
He got really good at it and he's getting, he's stacking clients,

629
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,080
he's stacking clients, he's stacking clients.

630
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:48,960
So, um, if you are somebody like in a job, you're like, let me get out

631
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,160
as soon as I possibly can, you're in a situation like Zach was, or I was in

632
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:58,160
whatever, um, what we're going to do, Zach, I will put the link once this

633
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:01,520
video goes live, I think I can go and edit the description.

634
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:05,160
Um, let me see if I still have, actually, you know what I can do.

635
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,160
I'm going to put your website.

636
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,080
What is your website?

637
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:14,960
Zach Kyle.co Z A C K P O W E L L dot C O.

638
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:22,280
One thing I'll add on that thought too, is like, um, I had to kind of figure

639
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:26,720
this all out on my own and it was the slow way it was the grind.

640
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:27,480
Oh yeah.

641
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:31,960
Now people that I teach and coach up, it's just like, dude, here

642
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,400
is the exact way to do it.

643
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,720
And it's insane.

644
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:40,280
I even thought when I started helping people, Oh, this might take a year for them,

645
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,920
but people have done it in three or four months.

646
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:48,560
So the six months is like totally reasonable to go from zero to 10,000

647
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,480
months recurring revenue.

648
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,600
People have done it in four months.

649
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:56,280
Like six months, many multiple people have done it in six months.

650
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,440
It's totally possible.

651
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:06,000
Where, like you're saying by April, like the, they say focus is follow

652
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,600
one course until successful.

653
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:12,720
If you just focus and do this for six months, your life is completely different.

654
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:18,480
You go and you have, you now have that freedom to do what lights you up.

655
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,080
Do whatever you're passionate about.

656
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,760
Like it's amazing.

657
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:26,240
So I would just encourage you, if you're on the fence, like just go from zero to

658
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:30,960
one, you go from zero to one, that's the biggest sale of your life.

659
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:36,480
Go from zero to one, and then it'll just start snowballing and you'll look back

660
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:41,640
in April at today and be like, Whoa, Zach and Nick were telling me, and it's been

661
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:44,960
six months and I've earned my freedom.

662
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,080
It's like Braveheart, man.

663
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,160
Everyone wants freedom.

664
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,240
We don't actually realize like jobs aren't freedom.

665
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:55,040
When you're an entrepreneur at heart, like you want that freedom, just go out

666
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,560
and get it and commit.

667
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:01,880
And it's just that daily consistency that your daily standard right now, your

668
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:05,720
daily standards here, what you need to do is raise it and maybe your daily standard

669
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:08,080
now becomes talking with 10 business owners every day.

670
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,320
That's your new standard.

671
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,480
You have to abide by it in six months.

672
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,040
You've committed to that new standard.

673
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,720
You'll see the results of that higher standard you committed to.

674
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,880
So it's totally possible.

675
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,760
I just hope everyone will do it.

676
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,960
It's, it's amazing.

677
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,000
Yeah.

678
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:29,360
And, uh, I should add this, um, when I started digital landlords and, and, you

679
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:33,280
know, all my free, my free pro my, sorry, my free group and everything.

680
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:38,880
I'm I've been very, very cautious to not let people just come into my groups and

681
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:44,800
start like trying to sell stuff or, you know, check this out because everyone's

682
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,440
full of crap.

683
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:45,960
You know what I mean?

684
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,920
Like I see this happened inside of our free Facebook group, which by the way,

685
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:56,080
you guys, we, we have a free Facebook group at, uh, art of Dre art of D re.com.

686
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,200
Anyway, if I see somebody trying to sell something, dude, I kick them out.

687
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,240
I don't even give them a warning.

688
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,040
Um, because I hate that.

689
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,400
Like they're just getting there like little snakes in the grass.

690
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:10,680
Um, and so it's, there are very few people that I let onto my lives.

691
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,160
Uh, there are very few people that I let, uh, become like an admin of my group.

692
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:20,320
There's like a, the list is like two, um, because I want to make sure they actually

693
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,840
know what they're talking about and they're actually making money doing what

694
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,760
they're saying they're doing.

695
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,520
And so Zach is one of those people.

696
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,720
I would never just let somebody come on my life.

697
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,920
And this is like the fourth or fifth time we've talked.

698
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,720
Um, so obviously people know that I've, I've seen your stuff.

699
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,120
I know that your numbers are real.

700
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,240
You're not a, you're not a snake in the grass.

701
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,680
So anyway, what I would encourage you guys to do, if you just hopped on, go and

702
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,280
watch this.

703
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:46,560
As soon as we hop off, this thing will post to my, the community section on

704
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:51,760
YouTube and, uh, you guys go watch this from the beginning and go check out Zach's

705
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:58,400
website, zachpal.co we've had quite a few people, um, inside of who's misunderstood.

706
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,360
It says, hi, misunderstood.

707
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,440
Uh, you missed us, but this is going to be live here in just a second.

708
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,560
Um, go check it out.

709
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,640
Go check out Zach's site.

710
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:09,160
He, I've seen him take, and I've, I've talked to these people personally.

711
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:12,760
I've seen him take a handful of people to 10, 20.

712
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,440
There's one of the people that you train.

713
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:17,840
That's like, like, like at your heels, like almost to pass you.

714
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,320
Right.

715
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:20,640
Yeah.

716
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:20,960
Yeah.

717
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,200
52,000 monthly career revenue.

718
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,240
He's like, I'm going to catch you.

719
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,320
I'm like sick, dude.

720
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:31,560
It's like, there's the Jedi, the apprentice and boom, you're going to,

721
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:36,840
bro, it's like, uh, inside of digital lines, we have Ryan Dalton.

722
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,920
He's at like 87,000 a month.

723
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:44,080
And I'm like, dude, this dude's coming at for me, but it's the best.

724
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:47,640
It's like the best compliment in the world that somebody that you train

725
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,880
passes you, but, uh, it still gives you a little fire.

726
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,800
Like, dude, no, no, no, I want to be at the top guy, you know?

727
00:39:55,160 --> 00:40:00,120
So, but, um, so yeah, guys, I'm going to link up Zach stuff.

728
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,400
Um, I'll get his socials and everything.

729
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,480
But yeah, check out his website, Zach pal.co.

730
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:09,720
He started just like you guys had a JLB wanted to have freedom.

731
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,240
And, uh, he's basically living the, the Tim Ferris life, going to

732
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,280
Nicaragua, going to Hawaii.

733
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:15,960
Yeah.

734
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,120
They just built him and his wife.

735
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,480
He wouldn't tell you guys this, but he just built a new house.

736
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:23,200
Um, all this is since we met and since he started doing this.

737
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,040
Cause I think when we met, dude, you were making like six, I think you

738
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:30,960
had started the business, but you were making like sub 10 K and now you're,

739
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
it's like your entire life has changed, dude.

740
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,040
It's crazy thinking how much your life could change in a

741
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,040
couple of years, you know?

742
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:38,320
Yeah.

743
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,360
It's mind boggling looking at that timeline.

744
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:41,280
Yeah.

745
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,480
Um, a lot can change quick, man.

746
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:47,240
If you just commit daily consistency, you guys will get there.

747
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,040
So let me ask you one more question.

748
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,440
This is the last thing I'm going to ask you.

749
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:54,520
How did you get, what did, did your wife believe in what you were

750
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,360
doing when you first started?

751
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:59,920
And if so, how did you get her to, if not, how did you get her to it?

752
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,880
This is something I hear all the time is like, you know, in a lot of times

753
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,600
people have their spouse that doesn't believe in them because they have a

754
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:10,000
previous mess up where maybe they decided they're going to do something

755
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,840
and they completely flop, but how, how was your wife's support and how did

756
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,080
you get her on board with you?

757
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,080
Cause I'm of course now she's proud of you.

758
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:23,080
She's like, yeah, my husband's the man because like she, he's going to take

759
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:26,280
care of us, we have a great lifestyle and all this stuff, this brand new house.

760
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,240
But when you started, was that the case?

761
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,640
That is a great question.

762
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:39,320
Um, I think it's just like any relationship where trust builds over time.

763
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:45,080
And so ever since we got married, before we were married, my wife

764
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,280
saw my consistent effort.

765
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,760
We were dating when I was doing sales, selling direct TV, and she saw me put

766
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:58,680
in the work, put in the work, put in the work, and then it was a long time.

767
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,600
And there was this big investment, right?

768
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,640
To invest in a course.

769
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,160
I'd never bought a course before.

770
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,400
I never bought a group before.

771
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:08,960
It was a lot of money when you're making only 4,600 bucks a month, right?

772
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,360
I'm like, dude, I'm going to invest in this.

773
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,720
I better, I better make this work.

774
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:18,400
And my wife was like, you're about to drop thousands of dollars on this.

775
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:19,920
Are you serious?

776
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:26,600
And I was like, yes, I absolutely am going to, and it's going to be the best

777
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,680
decision we ever made.

778
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:33,600
I was so set because my mindset was, it wasn't, oh, I'm going to buy this

779
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,800
thing because I have some savings and give it a go.

780
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,360
It was like, I am going to do this.

781
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:43,120
I am committed and I will gain my freedom.

782
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,680
This will happen.

783
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:48,480
And so when I explained it in that way, I was like, babe, look,

784
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,640
people are doing this.

785
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:55,360
Other people have made this possible and I can hustle in that way.

786
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,240
I can hustle in that same way.

787
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,320
They're not any smarter than me.

788
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:03,360
Um, I can figure this out and I'm going to grind.

789
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,480
If it takes, I was committed for multiple years.

790
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:09,760
I was like, if I have to grind and I don't make money doing this for one

791
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:12,120
year or two years, that's okay.

792
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:18,800
I'm committed for the long haul because I have this vision of in five years, I'm

793
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:22,360
going to own a business like these other people, but I could see their timelines

794
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,520
and I could see people who were doing this in a year, two years.

795
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:31,840
And I was, okay, I'm going to commit for two years and see where I'm at.

796
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:34,240
I'm just going to grind, push every day, push every day.

797
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:37,920
And so when she saw that commitment, she was like, okay, we've never spent

798
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:44,280
this many thousands of dollars on anything, but like you have my trust

799
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,480
and you're going to do this.

800
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,200
It's going to be great.

801
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,720
So she gave me the green light and I'm like, so grateful that she did, you know,

802
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:51,320
she's a nurse.

803
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:55,960
And so she basically had all of our savings and was investing it in me,

804
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:59,640
which was an honor, but also like a responsibility.

805
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:07,800
So, um, that mindset going in to just be like, I'm going to make this work.

806
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,880
Um, I think it's kind of what you want to have.

807
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:16,440
Um, and that's how, like, if you're not, I guess on the other side, if you're,

808
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,880
if you're thinking right now, like, Oh, I'm not consistent.

809
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:20,400
I've said things and I don't do them.

810
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:22,520
Like that's okay.

811
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,320
The past is irrelevant.

812
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:29,480
All that we care about is now and each day moving forward.

813
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:35,320
So build the self-confidence in yourself day by day with those little decisions.

814
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,440
What are you going to commit to today?

815
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,960
Are you going to commit to waking up at a certain time?

816
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:42,440
Like start doing that thing.

817
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:48,160
Are you going to commit to go work out for 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes a

818
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,600
day, what level are you willing to commit to?

819
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,680
And if you do it every single day, you'll build that trust in yourself.

820
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:59,040
But the people around you, your wife, your spouse, they'll start seeing that

821
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,400
and they'll trust you more.

822
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:03,080
And they'll be like, he keeps his word.

823
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,640
He keeps his word to himself.

824
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,440
He keeps his word to his family.

825
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:11,320
I trust him with this big investment because he is consistent in all these

826
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:14,280
other areas, of course, he's going to be consistent in this too.

827
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:15,840
So I think it's just like a muscle.

828
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:17,360
If you feel like, Oh, I'm not consistent.

829
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:18,320
I don't trust myself.

830
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:19,960
Like you got to build that.

831
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:23,600
Start where you're at and just like little by little, boom, keep stacking

832
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:24,880
wins, keep stacking wins.

833
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:30,120
And once you're consistent with one thing, add another until now you're unstoppable

834
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:33,920
and you're just able to achieve everything that you want to super quickly.

835
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,200
So that's kind of my thought on that is build the trust.

836
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:40,840
If you don't have it work today on just building that little trust, you'll

837
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:43,440
strengthen your relationship with your spouse, you'll strengthen your

838
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:48,160
confidence in yourself and you'll get your results step by step, brick by

839
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,080
brick building over time.

840
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:52,040
Oh yeah.

841
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,000
I mean, dude, I had the same thing.

842
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:00,800
Like I was doing door to door and I proved myself, you know, and my wife was

843
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,720
like, yeah, okay, this guy knows what he's doing.

844
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:06,280
Like, and so then when I made my next decision, which was to start a software

845
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,720
company, I didn't even have to ask her.

846
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,120
But then of course that failed and it kind of lost her trust.

847
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:16,120
So then I was back on like, you have to continually make sure that people

848
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:17,800
around you know that you're going to take care of them.

849
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:22,920
It's like this big thing, especially I feel like with, uh, with, uh, oh shoot.

850
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:23,720
Can you still hear me?

851
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:24,240
Oh, there we go.

852
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:24,880
You're still good.

853
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:27,160
Okay.

854
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:29,280
My internet shake anyway.

855
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:34,120
Um, but then guys, the point being is that if you guys are having an issue

856
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:37,880
with your spouse or with your significant other, like having that belief in you,

857
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:41,240
it's probably because you don't, you've never given them a reason to trust you.

858
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:45,480
And so for me, when I got into this business, ultimately, like I had made a

859
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:46,160
mistake or two.

860
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,680
I had lost money in the stock market.

861
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:50,880
I w you know, I lost like $50,000 on a stock.

862
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,840
I didn't really properly check out.

863
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:59,120
And so I had to just make the, like, I, I tried to get her blessing and she's

864
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:01,200
like, basically it was like, no.

865
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:05,160
And I had to make, I had to, I had to just make the, uh, the presidential

866
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:09,160
decision that even though it was a no, I had to, I still had to do it.

867
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:14,320
So I went ahead without her permission with the mentality, like I have to make

868
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:18,160
this work or I'm going to be toast for my entire relationship.

869
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,720
So, um, and that's exactly what I did.

870
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:24,280
And we had a little day or two where she was upset, but I was like, look, I'm

871
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:26,200
the one that's in charge of making money for this house.

872
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:27,600
I'm going to make this work.

873
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:34,520
And what, to your point, when you change your mentality from like, you know, I'm

874
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:38,160
going to give it a couple months or whatever, and you're like, I am going to

875
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:42,040
make this work because Zach Powell made it work, I can make it work, which

876
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:44,680
means it's possible and I will do it 10 years.

877
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:47,080
If it takes it, I'm not thinking about anything else.

878
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:48,000
I'm just going to focus.

879
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:49,520
You can make anything work.

880
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,120
You can go make money in an MLM.

881
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:54,680
You can make money selling fricking lotions and potions or door to door.

882
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:56,920
It's just that you have to change the mentality.

883
00:47:56,920 --> 00:48:00,280
Like I'm going to do it until it works and remove all the distractions.

884
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,320
Um, and you can make it work.

885
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:05,920
So any of you guys that are hesitant about starting an SEO business, starting

886
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:10,880
a Legion agency, doing digital real estate, you, you can make money in anything.

887
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:13,680
You just have to do it long enough and you have to just say, I'm going to do it

888
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:16,360
until and the, and it will work.

889
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:16,840
It will work.

890
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:17,560
It's that simple.

891
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:22,240
So anyway, Zach Powell, I know it's like nine 15 to where you're at.

892
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:24,440
It's eight to eight 13 in the morning, dude.

893
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:26,040
