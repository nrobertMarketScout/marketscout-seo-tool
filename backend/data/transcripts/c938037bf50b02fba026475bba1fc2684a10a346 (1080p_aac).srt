1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,740
Guys, in this training, I'm gonna be talking about something that you are not doing that

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:10,420
is costing you tens of thousands of dollars, and I say you're not doing, I'm not speaking

3
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:14,760
for 100% of people, but I'm speaking for 99% of people, okay?

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:20,000
And this is supposed to be live training, I tried to go live, I'm in London, hotel Wi-Fi

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,640
is crappy, so I'm just gonna record this, and then if you're watching this, it's because

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,640
it was posted.

7
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,180
I apologize, couldn't do it live.

8
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,980
That's how the cookie crumbles sometimes, guys.

9
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:34,780
So let me pull up my notes really quick, I want to make sure I'm not missing anything.

10
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:41,300
This is something, guys, what I'm gonna talk about today is something that I wish, I truly

11
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:45,980
wish that somebody would have told me and would have allowed me to do, would have encouraged

12
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:50,340
me to do, but that was not the case whatsoever, and I'll kind of get into what I mean by that

13
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,460
here in just a second, okay?

14
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:58,740
What I'm gonna talk about today is something that literally has made me, you know when

15
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:03,720
people say it's made me millions of dollars, and it just sounds cliche, this has actually

16
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:10,100
made me millions of dollars, I can definitively say it has made me not one, not two, multiple

17
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,700
millions of dollars, okay?

18
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:16,660
So let me start by saying this, guys, I grew up, let me get all this stuff out of my way

19
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:23,140
because I want to put my elbow here, because I grew up in a household and in a family and

20
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:30,500
in a community where I was taught that you should let your actions speak for themselves,

21
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,500
okay?

22
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,980
I was taught that you didn't need to talk about your success, you shouldn't talk about

23
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:39,700
your success, you should just do, okay?

24
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:44,220
Which I do respect, and I get, but that was how I grew up, okay?

25
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:48,420
And I'm guessing that a lot of you guys, because I know a lot of you guys and I've talked to

26
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:53,720
many of you, probably the majority of you I've had a conversation with, and I know you

27
00:01:53,720 --> 00:02:00,620
guys grew up in similar kind of circumstances and similar kind of ways of growing up, okay?

28
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:04,300
And so I want to just talk about this for just a second, and for the record I just want

29
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:10,260
to mention that I do appreciate how I was brought up and I learned a lot from it and

30
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:13,140
in many, many ways I agree, okay?

31
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:18,500
However, I have to make a point, and we have to remember that the world is also different.

32
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,980
The world is very different than it was, you know, when I grew up in, let's say I was in

33
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:28,980
high school and I was 12, let's say 20 years ago, you know, the world 20 years ago compared

34
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:34,300
to today is not even, it doesn't even resemble, it's not even close, okay?

35
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:39,300
The world wasn't near as noisy, one, and attention wasn't near as valuable.

36
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,580
We live, and I know this kind of sounds like I'm stealing this from Gary V, because he

37
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:46,060
always says this, but we literally live in an attention economy, and the people that

38
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:49,220
make the money are the ones that know how to get attention and they convert it into

39
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:53,020
money, and that wasn't the case back then, okay?

40
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:57,620
So I don't fault my parents or anyone that grew up around me that was always encouraging

41
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:04,460
me not to talk, not to get attention, to lay low, to let my actions speak for themselves,

42
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:08,900
and that's just the advice that I was given, but I want you to keep in mind guys that as

43
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,940
of course our parents and the people that are around us were trying to do what's best

44
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:17,580
for us and what's right by us, but they, like, the world has changed, okay?

45
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:18,580
That's the point, okay?

46
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:21,500
And we are here to make money.

47
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:26,180
We are here talking about how do you make money, how do we get out of the rat race,

48
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:29,940
and so with that said guys, just know that the world has changed.

49
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:37,940
Alright, when I first started in 2016, this is nine years ago, I had the biggest scarcity

50
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,060
mindset in business, okay?

51
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:43,980
To the extent, guys, that I remember going through my Facebook friends and I thought,

52
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:50,060
you know what, anybody that's in my Facebook friends, that's in one of these rank and rent

53
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:55,620
and digital real estate or digital marketing groups, I'm deleting them as a friend, I don't

54
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,980
want to know you, I don't want to talk to you, I don't want you looking at my page and

55
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:02,860
seeing what pages I've liked, and then you can maybe find out my niche and you can see

56
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:07,140
that my clients are friends with me, and that's literally the way that I thought, and I remember

57
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:12,100
literally sitting there one day, and I went through, and anybody that was a friend that

58
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:16,780
had a mutual friend with a few different people that I knew were part of this other group,

59
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:20,140
I just deleted them, gone out of my life, don't care, don't want to talk to you, don't

60
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:24,860
want to, I wanted to be a fly on the wall, and I was that guy that would be in the group,

61
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:30,580
and I was consuming stuff, but I was very, there was no producing, there was no value

62
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:35,660
being added, it was just consume, go in, lurk, get out, okay?

63
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:41,620
I didn't interact, I didn't post, I didn't share, and I only came in the group to ask

64
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:45,620
questions when I absolutely had to, okay?

65
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:51,060
And that was how I was, that was 2017, 18-ish, okay?

66
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,260
Probably up until about 2019.

67
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,620
Somewhere along the line, this is where we're going to get into what I want to share with

68
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:00,920
you guys, somewhere along the line, I started noticing, you know, I heard people point this

69
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:05,620
out and they talked about this attention thing, but I started noticing people that were like

70
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:10,300
really taking off, and we're talking about the, you know, Grant Cardona, I don't know,

71
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:16,660
from like 2012 to 2020, he had this tremendous, still very relevant, but had this huge run,

72
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:23,100
and he was, you know, very captivating and polarizing, and I watched him, obviously Gary

73
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:31,620
Vee, and then I remember watching just somebody like Jake Paul, this is 2019, 2020, and just

74
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:35,420
people were like, that guy, he's kind of a clown, but that dude knows how to get attention,

75
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:39,620
he's a genius marketer, and I was like, yeah, they're actually right, this guy knows how

76
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:43,940
to get attention, and so as I saw this and I saw what he was doing, Jake Paul was taking

77
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:49,540
his attention, he was getting attention, he was turning it into, in the case now, since

78
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:54,220
2020, 2019, he was turning it into fights, where he'd go, you know, create these fights,

79
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,660
he'd get a bunch of people to view it, and he was making millions, and he still is making

80
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:03,980
millions and millions of dollars, and so that was when I realized like, there's something

81
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:08,300
here, and I'm missing something, and yeah, it's embarrassing, and yeah, I didn't grow

82
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:13,700
up like this, and yeah, you know, I'm not making that much money, but there is value

83
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:18,500
in building an audience, okay, and so here's what I did, and this is where I went right,

84
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:22,940
and I didn't, I had to do it very strategically because the groups that I were in, they did

85
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:29,860
not, they did not encourage this, in fact, they really hated this because they felt threatened

86
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:33,860
that somebody was gonna come in and take their business or have more influence, whatever,

87
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:38,140
and I have a complete opposite approach, but anyway, 2020, guys, as I started scaling

88
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:42,780
up, as I started going on my run, as I started, and my run being from eight to 10,000 bucks,

89
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:47,460
scaling up to that $100,000 per month mark, I just intuitively knew like, Nick, you need

90
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:51,180
to share your story, you need to start, you know, adding value, I didn't know at that

91
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:54,300
time what it was gonna be worth, I didn't know if people were gonna resonate with it,

92
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:59,740
but I just started sharing my journey, I started sharing the deals that I was closing, I shared

93
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:05,660
when we added $10,000 in one month in revenue, I shared when I figured out the lead value

94
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:08,860
calculator, I remember making the video talking about the lead value calculator in one of

95
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:13,300
my groups, I was in Virginia, and I sat in my hotel room, and I was like, this is like

96
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:17,340
the most genius way to come up with pricing, and it's working for me, let me go ahead and

97
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:21,500
make this video, and I shared it in the group, and people loved it, and I was just, I probably

98
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:26,820
made like, in 2020, I probably made like eight to 10 posts, it's nothing crazy, but it was

99
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:31,420
just the things I was learning, the wins, I didn't share, I didn't have a ton of losses,

100
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:34,700
to be honest, but I didn't share a lot of losses, which I wish I would have shared more

101
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:42,180
of, but I just started sharing stuff, man, I just started sharing my journey, and scary

102
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:47,460
at first, I remember, you know, pushing posts on some of these different posts, and just

103
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,140
wondering if anyone was gonna like it, or if it was gonna be that post that had one

104
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:54,740
like or no likes, and it was three days later, but people really, really liked it, and so

105
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:59,460
what happened, started happening, guys, is over time, throughout 20, I did this in 2020,

106
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:05,340
then I did it again in 2021, and over time, guys, I started building this little micro

107
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:08,940
following inside of some of these groups, just by sharing my story, and sometimes the

108
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:12,020
people would actually reach out to me and ask me questions, other times, and I didn't

109
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:15,940
even know this, people would just kind of keep an eye on me, maybe they wouldn't even

110
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:20,500
add me as a friend, I only found this out like three, four years later, when people,

111
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:25,060
let's say, some of you guys, some of you are those people, had joined this group or

112
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:29,260
got on a call with me and said, hey, I remember you in such and such group, the posts that

113
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,900
you're making, and I saw one of them, and I remember thinking like, I gotta watch out

114
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:38,020
for this guy, right? Guys, doing this, I did this for two years, all of 2020, all of 2021,

115
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:43,180
it did not make me any money, like it didn't make me $0, so imagine every time I wrote

116
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:48,260
a post, let's say it took me 30 minutes to write a thought provoking, not a thought provoking,

117
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:53,620
an experience that also was thought provoking post, I wasn't seeing money from that 30 minutes,

118
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:57,300
right? But I guess just deep down, I knew that it was gonna be worth it, so I kept doing it,

119
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:03,460
kept doing it, kept doing it, again, 2020, 2021, and guys, by the end of 2021,

120
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:08,980
that all changed, because I was getting so many messages from people,

121
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:12,660
not even just following me, but people were literally sending me messages, hey, how you

122
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,060
doing this, how you coming up with the price, how you getting the flat fee deal, how'd you do the

123
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:19,780
pre-sale, how'd you do 10,000 a month, how did you do this, and I was answering all the questions

124
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:23,460
that I could, but I knew that I was just drowning, because there's no way I could keep up with all

125
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:27,300
of it, so that's when I started putting everybody in a free Facebook group, and just sharing what

126
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:32,980
was working once, and letting everybody consume it, okay? And so, what ended up happening from

127
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:37,140
that, and this is where I made my money, and I'm not saying that your journey's gonna be the exact

128
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:41,620
same, but you guys are gonna be surprised at the different opportunities that are gonna be there,

129
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:46,260
if you guys will build a following, if you will create influence, if you will

130
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:51,540
make yourself an authority in this space, and in this group, and I'm literally giving you the

131
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:57,700
platform, I'm asking you to do it, I'm allowing you to do it, and it sounds like funny, but

132
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:02,740
I was never part of groups where they let you do that. Every time I would make a post,

133
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:05,460
it's like, what are you trying to do, what are you trying to sell, I'm like, I'm not trying to sell

134
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:09,540
anything, I'm just trying to let people know what I'm up to, and trust that I know what I'm talking

135
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:14,100
about, because if I end up doing something, I wanna have people that have seen me, that know me,

136
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,780
that trust me, okay? So guys, I put all these people in a Facebook group, I've been doing this

137
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:23,380
for two years, making these posts, people have been following me, and I realized based on the

138
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:29,940
feedback, and the questions, and the DMs, I was like, people need what I have, people wanna know

139
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:34,020
how to sell, people, you know, yeah, there's a million courses out there that teach you how

140
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:38,340
to rank a website, there's a million courses that teach you how to get leads, and a lot of them are

141
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:44,260
good, but most of these people do not know how to sell, they do not know who to call, how to call,

142
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:48,580
what to say, how to overcome objections, how to send a screencast that's gonna eliminate the

143
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:52,340
objections, how to close, what happens if, they don't know any of this stuff, and this is the

144
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:58,180
stuff that I'm good at, this is stuff that I've been perfecting, guys, for, you know, for two years,

145
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:05,380
I mean, more like six, but two years just grinding it out, and so what I ended up doing is I ended

146
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:08,660
up saying, you know what, I'm gonna start a program, this ended up being Digital Landlords,

147
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:14,900
I'm gonna start a program, and I'm going to start with a beta group, and I'm gonna take a certain

148
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:19,300
amount of students, and I'm gonna take them, I'm gonna train them, I'm gonna do everything that

149
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:23,700
can give them the best service I can possibly give them, at a discount, because they're taking

150
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:30,020
a risk with me, because I have no credentials, I have no, you know, case studies, whatever,

151
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:35,140
and I'm gonna go help them have tremendous success, and from that, then I'm gonna like

152
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:40,660
really launch my program, and see where I can take this thing, and so guys, what I ended up doing is

153
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:45,860
I went into my Facebook group, I went live the day before Thanksgiving, I jumped on, I said, look,

154
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:50,020
here's the deal, I wanna start a program, I'm gonna teach everything that I know about selling,

155
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:54,180
about scaling, about doing this business the way that I've done it, that allowed me to get to

156
00:11:54,180 --> 00:12:01,540
$100,000 per month, if you wanna check out the offering, get on a webinar on Monday, that's it,

157
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:06,900
fill out an application that says you wanna apply to the actual call, I'm gonna be pitching you guys

158
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:12,020
on what the offer is, but if you want, it's gonna be discounted, because guess what, there is no

159
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:16,500
program, I'm gonna teach it to you live, there is no Facebook group, I'm gonna create it as soon as

160
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:22,180
we do this webinar, I have nothing to show, so you have to just have faith in me and what I'm doing,

161
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:30,500
and so I did this webinar the next Monday, and I had, I think it was 32 or 33 people show up,

162
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:37,220
and there was only one person that did not buy, now they all didn't buy right on the spot, but

163
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:42,340
within a few days, the few people that didn't buy, we ended up working out some kind of a resolution,

164
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:47,300
and there was only one person that, by the way, that same person, I see them all the time kicking

165
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:52,420
around the free groups, kicking around the free resources, it's been three years now, and they're

166
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:58,660
still stumbling around trying to avoid paying the piper, it's hilarious, and I always see them,

167
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:03,540
and I'm like, that's funny, that's the one person that didn't buy. Guys, that first day,

168
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:11,460
I made almost 100,000 bucks, I was like 97,000, literally, I don't know, I almost made 100,000

169
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:20,020
bucks in that very first day. Now, why do I tell you that? Because that all came and that was all

170
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:25,620
possible because I built influence, because I built a micro following, I didn't know what it

171
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:30,340
was gonna look like, I didn't know if I was gonna do a program, I didn't know if I was gonna do

172
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:34,660
consulting, I didn't know if I was gonna do anything, but I spent the time, I made about

173
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:40,180
10 posts in 2020, I probably made the same in 2021, I answered people's questions, I was active

174
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:46,020
in the group, I spent time in the DMs, not a lot of time, but I spent time, and I just started

175
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:52,980
building my brand as Nick Wood, as somebody who owns this agency called Evergreen, and I started

176
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:58,980
building this little micro following inside of this really unknown niche called Rankin Rent,

177
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:03,700
inside of a few Facebook groups, just by sharing my story, just by sharing my wins,

178
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:10,580
sharing a few losses, commenting, giving my input, sharing a tip here, sharing a strategy,

179
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:15,220
that's all that I did, guys, and literally made on my very first day when I decided to monetize

180
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:21,300
this, I made 100,000 bucks, give or take, let's call it 95,000, and literally some of these people

181
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:27,940
had just seen a post, and that's it, that's it. So what I'm telling you guys to do, guys,

182
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:35,940
and I'm encouraging you to do, and what I'm suggesting you do, and by the way, I apologize,

183
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:40,340
I'm kind of trying to talk a little bit quiet, I can hear somebody's outside cleaning,

184
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:44,260
I got people next door, I'm trying to be a little bit quiet and respectful here,

185
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:51,060
as I'm in the hotel room, and it's the afternoon, but guys, I'm asking you to do the same thing,

186
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:54,580
okay, and I'm gonna tell you why I'm suggesting it, what's in it for me, because there is a benefit

187
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:59,060
for me, and I'm gonna tell you why here in just a second, but I'm not only allowing you to do it,

188
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:03,300
I'm asking you to do it, I'm suggesting you do it, and it is going to be worth your time,

189
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:07,060
and I'm not saying that you're gonna start a program, I'm not saying you're gonna do anything

190
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:12,340
with it immediately, but heaven forbid you build a following, you're already in the group, you're

191
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:16,020
already asking questions, already finding out answers, if you find out a new answer, you find

192
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:21,620
out some little thing, it takes you five minutes to go and post about it, right, it's not much,

193
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:27,460
but heaven forbid you get down the road and you end up meeting somebody who has something

194
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:33,220
that's really valuable, maybe it's some AI tool that's really valuable for flipping websites,

195
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:40,580
you know, spinning up websites, whatever, quickly, and you now have, oh, you have an audience, you

196
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:46,740
have a following, you have a built-in customer base, and those posts that you made when you

197
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:52,740
had nothing to offer are going to be worth thousands of dollars. Now, the hard part about

198
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:56,980
this, guys, is that you're not gonna see the money immediately, you don't even know how it's gonna

199
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:00,340
work, you don't know how you're gonna monetize it, you don't know if you're ever gonna monetize it,

200
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:07,220
but I will tell you guys that it will be worth your time, even if you don't end up monetizing it,

201
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:10,820
because I think eventually you will, but even if you never do, it's still gonna be worth your time,

202
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:15,620
so here's, and my goal was initially, because I was gonna have Porter on this call, I was gonna

203
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:19,940
have him share his thoughts, because I had this conversation with Porter when he first started,

204
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:24,020
he was really being quiet, he wasn't sharing a lot, he grew up in the same household as me,

205
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:32,340
don't talk, don't, whatever, whatever, whatever, and he's even more conservative and, what's the

206
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:38,980
word, not the same, like he's even more reserved, I guess, than I am, I wanted to have him share

207
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:41,940
his experience, and I was like, dude, you gotta share, you gotta share your posts, you gotta share

208
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:46,900
your wins, and you guys don't have to do it in a braggadocious way, you don't have to do it in a

209
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:52,420
loud manner, like I sometimes come across, I know, I know, it's annoying, but here's what I'm asking

210
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:57,220
you guys to do, okay, asking you, number one, first of all, you gotta fix your head, you gotta

211
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:04,580
create an abundance mindset that you know that sharing is not only not gonna hurt you, but it's

212
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:08,580
the single best thing you can do for yourself, you're building authority, you're building a

213
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:14,900
micro audience inside of your community, or inside of here, inside of the free Facebook group,

214
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:18,420
inside of the school community, but you have to have an abundance mindset, you have to realize

215
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:22,980
that sharing is not gonna hurt you, okay, it's not gonna hurt you, in fact, it's going to help you,

216
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:28,500
period, okay, again, I'm not only letting you do it, but I'm asking you to do it, okay, so here's

217
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:33,940
what I'm suggesting that you do, is what I would suggest doing is commit to spending the time

218
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:38,340
to being vulnerable about your journey, and you're all gonna have different journeys, some of you

219
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:41,940
guys are gonna get a deal right out the gate, and you're gonna just go, some of you guys are gonna

220
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:45,300
get a deal out the gate, then you're gonna stumble, and you're gonna get distracted, and you're gonna

221
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:48,820
leave for six months, and come back, some of you guys are not gonna get a deal for six months, and

222
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:52,900
then you're gonna get a deal, and then you're gonna crush it, everybody's got a different story,

223
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:58,020
but I just am imploring you to just share your story, the things you're learning, the things that

224
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:03,540
the mistakes you've made, the losses, the wins, everything, okay, all I'm asking to do in terms

225
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:12,820
of like actual actions, is commit to doing two posts a week, okay, that's it, pick two days,

226
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:23,620
pick two days, Monday, Thursday, Tuesday, Friday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and share a simple win or loss

227
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:30,580
or lesson learned, and that's it, okay, if you were actually, if you planned out your month,

228
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:34,260
and you said, hey, I'm gonna do it on these days, there's eight different posts I'm gonna make,

229
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:38,100
on Sunday, I'm gonna think, what did I learn last week, I'm gonna come up with five ideas,

230
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:41,860
I'm gonna choose two of them, and I'm gonna share them on those two days, I'm gonna put a picture,

231
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:45,220
so it makes a little bit more interesting, I'm gonna just think of something interesting to say

232
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:50,340
in the first line, so people actually know this is a valuable post, and you spent, I bet you that

233
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:55,860
would take you 30 minutes a week, with the ideas, with the posting, with the whole deal, okay,

234
00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:02,420
two posts, two days, sharing a win or a loss, lesson learned, that's what I'm asking you to do,

235
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:09,220
do it every single week, and keep doing it, and do it forever, just get used to it, just make it

236
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:12,580
a habit, just the same way that you freaking drink water, because we're never gonna stop drinking

237
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:15,780
water, we're never gonna stop eating, we're never gonna stop sleeping, it's just part of what you do,

238
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:19,860
is you put out content, and you look at it as, hey, I'm producing, I'm doing something that's

239
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:24,260
adding value, and just becomes part of who you are, and some of you guys that are having a hard

240
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:27,460
time following what I'm saying, do it because you're helping people, what you guys don't

241
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:32,660
understand is that a lot of people are watching you, a lot of people are watching you specifically,

242
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:37,220
you that's listening, they relate to you, not me, not to Kyle, not to Francesco, not to Porter,

243
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:40,660
but you, for whatever reason, because maybe you're a cop, or maybe you're a school teacher,

244
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:46,180
or maybe you're a single mom, but it's you that they noticed, and they're waiting for you to fail

245
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:51,380
or to succeed, and you have no idea how much that does for people, okay, now, let me tell you the

246
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:56,820
benefits of this, okay, number one, as I said, which is obvious, is you're gonna be building an

247
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:00,900
audience, you're gonna be building authority, and I assure you that at some future period,

248
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:05,620
it will be worth your time, and you will be able to cash out later on, I promise you, you will be

249
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:09,220
able to cash out, okay, you might not choose to, but you will have the option, you will have,

250
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:15,460
you're building, you're literally putting money, it's kind of like you have a future credit to

251
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:19,620
cash out, okay, number two, this is another benefit you're gonna have, forget about building an

252
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:25,380
audience, forget about, you know, a following, but you are doing this, guys, you hold yourself

253
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:30,580
accountable, when you do this, when you tell people what you're up to, you know, what your goals are,

254
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:35,940
hey, I'm gonna do this much money, you know, Porter's announced that many times, he's gonna

255
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:40,980
do $25,000 by the end of the year, he is holding himself accountable, doing this will make you more

256
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:44,100
money, because you're gonna be talking about your goals, you're gonna be talking about your dreams,

257
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:47,620
you're gonna be talking about the things that you're planning on doing, you're committing to

258
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:52,980
doing, it is going to make you more money, okay, and guys, part of that is that when you start

259
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:57,860
talking about it, in some of these other groups, like the school community inside of the free

260
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:04,180
Facebook group, I actually, if you send anyone to us, I actually pay you guys a really good

261
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:07,860
affiliates, there's somebody in this group, I'm not gonna mention their name, but they've made

262
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:15,860
over 6,000 bucks, just sharing a few wins, and me paying them, because they've sent, I create a

263
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:20,180
custom application, you get it, they send it, all you have to do is send it to them, they fill it

264
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:25,060
out, and we close them, you get paid, and it's great money, okay, that's just a side benefit,

265
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:28,820
but guys, it will make you more money, because it's gonna hold you accountable, okay,

266
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:33,460
the next thing it's gonna do, guys, it's gonna give you clarity and more understanding about

267
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:37,620
the things that you're learning, when you teach somebody else something that you learned,

268
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:42,100
it makes it that much more clear in your mind, when you teach somebody something that you've

269
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:49,300
learned, and you try to articulate it on paper, or on a post, you learn it better, because you're

270
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:55,380
now explaining, now you're the teacher, and it makes it, it becomes more clear by you doing that,

271
00:21:55,380 --> 00:22:00,580
okay, so it's very, like that to me is huge, whenever I learn something, and then I post it,

272
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:05,940
I really sit down, I articulate it correctly, and it forces me to explain it in a way that

273
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:10,820
people understand it, and it makes me learn it better, okay, and the last benefit, guys,

274
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:16,500
is you are going to inspire and help people way more than you have, you have no idea how much

275
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:20,580
people are watching, I remember looking at posts that would inspire me, that got me excited, I

276
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:24,820
remember being on a cruise back in 2019, when I was determining, should I stay, should I go,

277
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:30,820
and I was just binge watching, I was binge watching the specific person's videos,

278
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:35,220
and it did everything to me, I was on at the gym, I would listen to their videos,

279
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:39,780
and I don't know, man, for some reason, I just related to this specific individual,

280
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:43,140
and it got me excited, it gave me that fire, that juice, that drive again,

281
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:48,500
and that was one of the reasons why I stayed, one of the reasons why I kept doing this,

282
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:53,300
and I was eight, nine months at that point, this is early December 2019, from being at

283
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:58,580
a hundred thousand bucks per month, okay, so guys, why would I want you to do this, well, because

284
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:03,140
what it does is actually, it helps both of us, okay, number one, it allows you to grow your

285
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:08,820
audience for free, you get to build a community within the community, and for me, it serves a

286
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:13,060
social proof, right, it serves as social proof for people that are in here that are struggling,

287
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:19,540
that are like, hey, Porter's getting a deal, he's doing the same thing as I'm doing, well,

288
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:24,180
clearly, it works, right, inside of here, and also, guys, when you share this inside of school,

289
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:28,500
when you share this inside of the free Facebook group, you have no idea how much that helps me

290
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:32,660
for social proof, and people, I could say stuff, I could show people how much money I've made,

291
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:36,660
I could show you my tax returns, I could show you my Stripe accounts, you could talk to my clients,

292
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:40,980
but for some reason, it just comes out different, and it comes out better when it comes from

293
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:45,060
somebody else, okay, so for me, it'd be a huge help, and that's the benefit for me, it's going

294
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:50,260
to give me that social proof, okay, the other thing that it's going to do for me, and for you,

295
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:54,340
is it's going to bring excitement, it's going to bring energy, it's going to bring that freaking

296
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:59,940
zeal to this group of, hey, we're closing freaking deals, John Jarwood, he just got a deal,

297
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:04,020
Irwin just got a deal, Porter just got another deal, Francesca just slammed the deal, what the

298
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:10,020
heck am I doing, right, it brings the energy, it brings the excitement, and it's intoxicating,

299
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:14,660
it's amazing, okay, and guys, I will tell you, I pay attention, I know who's active,

300
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:20,260
I see who posts, I see who comments, I see who is actually doing production, and is giving value,

301
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:24,500
and who's just a leak, just so you guys know, okay, and I appreciate it, and I will always take care

302
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:30,660
of you guys, so my challenge to you guys is that you fix your head, you create an abundance

303
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:35,140
mindset, say, hey, look, you know, and I'm not telling you, you need to go and share exact cities

304
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:38,980
and exact niches of what you're in, no, I'm not saying that, but if you learn something, if you

305
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:44,740
go through the trouble of finding something out, go share it, I promise you, I know it sounds like

306
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:49,140
it's going to be a bad decision, and you're going to create your own competition, guys, I've been

307
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:57,300
sharing everything I know for years, and it's not ever hurt me, okay, it has never hurt me, you just

308
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:01,780
got to have an abundance mindset, and you have to know that, hey, I'm somebody that's always in the

309
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:04,980
game, I'm somebody that's going to be learning the next thing, the next tip, the next trick,

310
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:08,980
so no matter what I share today, I'm going to have something new tomorrow, and I'm going to help a

311
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:12,420
bunch of people, and by doing that, they're going to trust me, they're going to follow me, and you

312
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:17,940
know what, down the road, I might cash in on that thing, I might, okay, so get the abundance mindset,

313
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:22,740
and all I ask you to do is commit to doing two posts a week, okay, pick two days, share a lesson

314
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:28,980
learned, a loss, a win, a lesson learned, share it, it doesn't have to be long, it could be a freaking

315
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:32,340
one line, it could be two lines, it could be a paragraph, it could be a couple paragraphs,

316
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:35,140
it could be a novel, I don't care, you could have a photo, you don't have to have a photo,

317
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:40,900
you could do a video, you could do a picture, you could do, I do not care, share two posts a week,

318
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:45,540
and then when people comment, interact with them, hey, yeah, clarify this, that, and the rest,

319
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:50,020
guys, this will change everything for you, when you start doing this, it's going to bring you

320
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:53,860
more clarity, it's going to hold you accountable, it's going to make you more money, and of course,

321
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:58,100
it's going to help me at the same time. If I had known this, guys, and I had started doing this back

322
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:03,220
in 2016, and I had shared my journey of, hey, here's where I'm at, and I just got this towing

323
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:07,060
deal, and then I got this crawl space deal, and oh, I got distracted, and now I'm over here,

324
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:10,900
those would be the most valuable posts ever, and I'd probably have 10 times more people following

325
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:16,660
me, and I probably, instead of making $100,000 my very first day, I probably would have made $250,000,

326
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:20,340
but I didn't know this, and nobody ever told me to do this, and nobody encouraged me to do this,

327
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:25,460
and nobody allowed me to do it, here I am, I have a community, I've built of 800 people inside this

328
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:33,220
group, 6,000 people inside of digital, art of digital real estate, and 250 plus, some of the,

329
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:37,780
you know, there's some overlap from these groups, inside of the school community, the art, sorry,

330
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:43,940
the rank and rent academy, and I'm letting you guys go and frickin' build your own network,

331
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:50,260
your own following within my groups that I've built with my money, with my attention, with the

332
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:55,540
people, with the videos that I've put up, and the production team that I have paid to put them on

333
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:59,540
YouTube, and to monitor the comments and everything else, I'm letting you tap into that 100% free,

334
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:03,540
why? Because I want social proof, I want to grow, I want you to grow, that's what this is about,

335
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:08,180
so guys, you don't have to do this, you can be like I was for the first little bit,

336
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:13,780
and I was Mr. hey, I'm not even gonna have a website, I'm gonna go get to a million

337
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:20,340
bucks a year, no website, no brand, I'm proud about it, screw you guys, you don't need it,

338
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:26,900
whatever, and I did that, okay, but all I can think about now, now that I've made millions of

339
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:32,260
dollars from doing this, literally millions of dollars from just sharing my journey,

340
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:37,860
I can't imagine how much money I left on the table, if I would have shared, yeah, I did it

341
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:42,580
without, I got $100,000 per month without a website, without a brand, nothing, great, good

342
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:47,460
job, Nick, pat on the back, how much money did you lose out on? I ask myself that all the time,

343
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:55,300
and I know it's a lot of freaking money, okay, so guys, this is something that if you are not

344
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:59,540
doing currently, I strongly encourage you, you are missing out on thousands of dollars,

345
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:04,980
thousands and hundreds of thousands of, possibly millions of future dollars,

346
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:08,740
it takes a couple minutes a week, just like the slide edge we've been talking about, guys,

347
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:12,820
you just put this in your calendar, you do it twice a week, it takes you less than 30 minutes,

348
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:19,860
complete, total 30 minutes, and you start building an audience, and I'm telling you guys in three,

349
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:26,180
four, one, two years, this is gonna pay off, so guys, I appreciate you watching this video,

350
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:29,940
I would love, I pay attention, I'd love for you guys to start doing this, it will help me,

351
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:35,220
it will help you, it will hold you accountable, guys, let's go get it, I've been there, I've done

352
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:39,460
it, you don't have to listen to what I'm saying, but I do know a thing or two, and I wish I would

353
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:42,420
have done this earlier, so guys, thanks for watching this video, thanks for watching this

354
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,500
training, I'll see you guys next Tuesday.
