1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Okay, and by the way, guys, you can all hear me, right?

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Yeah.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Cool.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Awesome.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Let's do this thing.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Let's guys today.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,920
I want to talk about low ticket versus high ticket.

8
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,280
First of all, I want to let you guys know what I'm going to do is anybody that's watching

9
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,640
this entire call that's on this the entire time.

10
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:25,240
We are going to just like last time, we're going to screenshot your name and we're going

11
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,240
to send you.

12
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,880
We're going to take all the information that we have in this presentation and distill it

13
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:37,040
down to something that's like consumable, like some type of a digital resource, whether

14
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:42,320
it's a list, whether it's a whatever the case is, Aaron's going to create it and everyone

15
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,080
that stays on this call the entire time is going to actually get that resource.

16
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:50,560
Okay, so just stay on and then you don't have to worry like we will give it away to a couple

17
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,600
people in the free group, but you guys don't have to worry about like commenting and stuff

18
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,600
like that.

19
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,160
So just so you know, that's kind of the thing that we're going to do to incentivize you

20
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,160
guys.

21
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,160
We want we want you to stay on.

22
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,560
Okay, so one thing that I realized this week as I was preparing for this and I was I was

23
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:13,440
doing my own education for myself, I realized that sometimes I assume that everybody knows

24
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,240
who I am, you know, like they know my entire story.

25
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,640
And because I've said it so many times, it becomes very boring to repeat.

26
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,400
But I want to just quickly, I basically want to just let you guys know if you're new to

27
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,720
this, if you're new to this group, you're new to this, this space, rank and rank digital

28
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:34,360
real estate, I want to like give you a reason to consider listening to me.

29
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,840
Okay, I don't think you should believe everything that I say or anything that I say, I think

30
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,840
you should test everything.

31
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,640
But I want to give you a reason to consider listening to what I have to say.

32
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,160
So quick background, 2016, I was knocking door to door.

33
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,160
I was tired of it.

34
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,440
I needed something that was online.

35
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,440
I wanted to travel the world.

36
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,280
By the way, here we are in Dubai doing exactly what I wanted to.

37
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,560
It's amazing.

38
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,560
I wanted something that was recurring.

39
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:02,100
I wanted to be able to have a life for my family, my kids and give them experiences.

40
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:06,160
And so in 2016, I got into this game.

41
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:10,240
I took my own advice that I give it and I found somebody that had a program and I did

42
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,560
the call and the whole thing, not even thinking I was getting sold.

43
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,580
And sure enough, I got sold and yeah, it was a thing between me and my wife.

44
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:22,120
She wasn't super excited about it, but I made a lot of money from it.

45
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,160
So I always remind her that I made a good decision.

46
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,720
So I've been in the game for eight years.

47
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,280
There was a little hiatus in there where I got some shiny object syndrome.

48
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,920
I tried to start a software company, but I've been in this game for eight years.

49
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:42,840
I've also spent and lost millions of dollars making mistakes, including at one point four

50
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,840
or five million dollars.

51
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,520
And I think it's a little bit higher than that now just on ads.

52
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,520
And I did that.

53
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,360
And the reason why I have this group is so that you guys don't have to, you don't have

54
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,880
to go make the one point four or five million dollar lessons.

55
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,040
I can teach them to you.

56
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:01,680
OK, so eight years in 2020, I finally figured it out.

57
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,160
There was some missing pieces.

58
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,840
That program that I was in, it was good, but there was missing pieces.

59
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,400
There just there was a lot of stuff that just these little things.

60
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,120
And finally, in 2020, I was able to scale.

61
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,120
I figured it out.

62
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,120
I nailed it.

63
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:19,640
And we went from eight thousand dollars a month in December of 2019, where I just about

64
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,640
walked away from the model.

65
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,920
I just about decided, hey, I'm just the sales guy.

66
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,560
I don't know if I'm cut out to be an entrepreneur.

67
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,840
Maybe I should just go sell for somebody else.

68
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,520
I was this I was this close.

69
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:33,840
I even had the deal in place, the commission, the company I was going to sell for.

70
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,520
And I looked at my goals and I wanted to make one hundred thousand dollars a month.

71
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:42,160
And I started to realize I'm like, Nick, you're never going to get there by doing by going

72
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,160
and selling for somebody else.

73
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,160
You just can't.

74
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,160
It's just it just doesn't work.

75
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,160
Right.

76
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,160
OK.

77
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,160
Yeah.

78
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,160
Maybe there's someone that sells commercial real estate at a brokerage.

79
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,160
OK.

80
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,880
For most people, it's impossible.

81
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:58,280
And so I luckily I doubled down, tripled down, got really focused and said, I'm going to

82
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,280
sit in this.

83
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,280
I'm going to figure this out.

84
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,200
And I changed my mindset from I'm going to try this for a year.

85
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,200
I'm going to try this for a week.

86
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,200
I'm going to try this.

87
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,920
And whatever I change it until I change it to, I'm going to do this until it works.

88
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,920
And I don't care if it takes five years.

89
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,220
I don't care if it takes 10 years.

90
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,220
This is the model.

91
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,220
And so we went from it's funny.

92
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,520
As soon as I got I switched that as soon as I got focused and I got rid of all the other

93
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:21,120
side businesses and everything else, I went from eight thousand dollars a month in twenty

94
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,520
nineteen December, July of twenty twenty, we did one hundred thousand dollars per month,

95
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,720
one hundred percent of that was Legion, zero SEO, zero consulting, zero side business money.

96
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,720
That was all from Legion.

97
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,080
And it and it was it was interesting.

98
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,080
I didn't even know.

99
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,640
I just I could just feel the momentum.

100
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,280
I didn't even know we were doing that well.

101
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,800
So that was in twenty twenty twenty twenty one.

102
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,600
We did one point four or five million dollars of top line in just my agency.

103
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,360
That doesn't include, you know, my program.

104
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,920
This was just in my agency.

105
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,960
And I know that because I remember looking at it and going how much of this was and I

106
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,360
think we made a little bit more than that because we just launched.

107
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,280
So in twenty December twenty twenty one, we launched digital landlords.

108
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:04,160
And the funny thing is, I use the exact same strategy, the same scripts, the same techniques,

109
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,760
the same everything that I teach in the program to sell the program.

110
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:13,400
And we launched it in December twenty twenty one in the very first year, twenty twenty

111
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,400
two.

112
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,920
We also did another seven figures with the program.

113
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:23,400
The point is, and I would say the most exciting part, the most exciting part about that is,

114
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,400
yes, we've had a lot of success with the program.

115
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:30,000
I've had a lot of success with the agency, but the best part is we we've had students

116
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
have tremendous success.

117
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,240
So I think you guys have probably seen this name, but Ryan Dalton, somebody that joined

118
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:40,400
with me like two years ago, just over two years ago, he just hit seventy five thousand

119
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,560
dollars per month, which is absolutely insane.

120
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:48,640
And so my ultimate goal with what I'm doing in this group, what I'm doing online, what

121
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,800
I'm doing with my program is I want to make I want to create a hunt.

122
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,880
I don't want to take the credit.

123
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,840
I want to help a hundred people become millionaires.

124
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,840
That is my ultimate goal.

125
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,720
And I have the business model that can do it.

126
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,920
And now it's just about finding those hundred people and helping them along the way.

127
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,720
Not everyone's going to become a millionaire.

128
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,720
That's just the reality.

129
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,720
But that is my ultimate goal.

130
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,480
And so that said, guys, that's why I'm doing this.

131
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,400
That's why I'm on here.

132
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,400
And of course, I'm in this for business.

133
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,560
I'm in this for money, whatever the case is, I'm not going to lie about that.

134
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:24,680
But just so you guys have an idea, those are some reasons maybe you could consider listening

135
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,200
to me.

136
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:31,920
So my goal with this specific training, guys, is I want to walk you through the pros and

137
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:39,000
cons of high ticket versus low ticket, including the lessons I learned and the lessons I guess

138
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,640
that I gleaned as I, when I started, jumped into both right away.

139
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,760
And I was trying all kinds of niches and all kinds of cities.

140
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,760
And I didn't know what I was doing.

141
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,920
And I was just making mistakes.

142
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:53,720
And I'm going to talk to you guys in this on this presentation or this call.

143
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,280
I'm going to teach you guys or talk to you about what worked and didn't work and also

144
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,960
the pitfalls to avoid.

145
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:05,800
And so the goal for me by the end of this next 30 minutes is I want you, every single

146
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:11,320
one of you on this call to be able to have enough information to make a very educated

147
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:15,320
and confident decision on which one is right for you.

148
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:19,080
And I would also go so far as to say that I don't think there is necessarily a I don't

149
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,080
think it's black and white.

150
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,480
I don't think it's binary.

151
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,640
I think there's shades of gray.

152
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:29,280
And so maybe for you, based on your situation and your appetite and your goals, low ticket

153
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,880
or high ticket may be for you and other people may be different.

154
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:36,560
The goal is by the end of this, you have enough information and you are going to be confident

155
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,200
and educated enough to make a decision on which one you want to pursue.

156
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:43,840
And I would recommend that you do one or the other, which I'll get into in a moment, not

157
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,840
do both.

158
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,760
OK, so I want you guys to be able to know which route you should take to start building

159
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:54,240
or if you haven't started to start building or keep building if you've already started

160
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,200
rather your rank and rent digital real estate empire.

161
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,080
OK, so what I would like to do to get started.

162
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,840
I don't want this to be like super stiff, me just up there at the pulpit preaching like

163
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,560
a pastor.

164
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,960
But so what I want you guys, if I ask a question and I ask for feedback, I understand some

165
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:15,520
of you guys may be like on the move or some of you guys may be taking care of kids or

166
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,520
whatever and you can't.

167
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,880
But it would really, really help.

168
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,560
And I pay attention to who interacts.

169
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,480
But if you guys could, if I ask a question, I want you guys to be in the comments.

170
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,880
I want to be able to see what people are saying.

171
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:30,360
And it just allows me to see who's paying attention and see what the energy is.

172
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:36,680
So what I'd like to do to get started is number one, as I said, if you guys have any questions

173
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,880
throughout this, I don't care if I'm talking about something completely different and something

174
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,880
just pops in your mind.

175
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,280
Just put it in the chat so I don't forget.

176
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,640
There's no stupid or basic questions.

177
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:51,360
OK, so what I want to do to start off this conversation, this presentation is I want

178
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:58,680
to ask everybody to drop a comment with a niche that they are considering going into.

179
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,720
OK, and again, there's no bad answers.

180
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,760
Don't think, oh, I'm going to put this and Nick's going to just tell me I'm stupid because

181
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,960
you guys might not know.

182
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,360
And I will tell you if it's not a good idea.

183
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,800
But I'm curious and I would love to get your feedback on everyone.

184
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,000
Drop a comment with a niche that you are considering going into.

185
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,480
OK, and what I would like to do, well, let's let's give everyone like a minute to do that.

186
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,480
OK.

187
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,840
Also, one thing while you guys are doing that, again, drop a comment of a niche you're

188
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,760
thinking about going into.

189
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,120
Aaron, if you would help me out in addition to admitting people, you just make sure that

190
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,120
everyone's on mute.

191
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,120
I don't hear anyone, but I just want to make sure that we're not getting completely sidetracked.

192
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,080
So somebody new comes in, just keep everyone on mute.

193
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,960
And then when we get to question and answer, we can unmute if you don't mind.

194
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,280
So here's what we got.

195
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,920
We got artificial grass.

196
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,640
Love that niche.

197
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:56,400
Artificial grass, fencing, good cleaning service, air duct, event photography, heat pumps,

198
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:02,280
electrical repair slash paving, epoxy garage floors, plumbing, spray foam installation,

199
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:08,720
garage building, concrete, home interior innovation, house painting.

200
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,000
OK, we've got a good mix.

201
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,640
We've got a good mix.

202
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,920
Gutter installation.

203
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,720
OK, I like these.

204
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,560
And we're going to talk.

205
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:24,080
By the way, if any of these you guys want feedback on, that could be a question I answer.

206
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,920
And at the end, I could do rapid fire like yay or nay.

207
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,720
And if I have a second, I can tell you why.

208
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,280
Because I've done almost every single one of these that you guys have put out, with

209
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:38,280
the exception of like, I think I've done all of them.

210
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:43,640
I don't think I've done home interior renovation, but I do have an opinion on it.

211
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,000
I think I've done the rest of them.

212
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,160
Yeah, I think I have.

213
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,920
And I've failed at a lot of them.

214
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:53,040
I have not done event photography and I've not done specifically heat pumps.

215
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,320
But everything else I have done.

216
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,720
So I can give you guys really good feedback because I've done it.

217
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,280
So, OK, if there's any more, let me know.

218
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:03,080
If not, we're going to continue along.

219
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,560
Now that we've got everyone here, what I want to say real quick,

220
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,000
I don't want to say this at the beginning, but the reason that we're doing this new

221
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,360
format, because if you have been in the group for a while, the free group,

222
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,320
I used to just go live in the Facebook group.

223
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,720
And then I had like it was like vanity metrics.

224
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,640
Like, how many people can we get on the call?

225
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,080
Can we get 100 people?

226
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,800
And thank goodness, I've like realized that doesn't matter because I don't care

227
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,840
if there's one person on this call, if there's five, that'd be great if there

228
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:32,120
was five thousand, but I don't know what it is.

229
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,400
But in every area of my life, I'm just realizing that quantity is so much

230
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:39,400
better than quality in the content that you produce, in the businesses that you

231
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,320
have or business that you have in the relationships that you have.

232
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,200
All of these things always about quantity.

233
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,080
And so as I told you guys, my goal.

234
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,200
Ultimate, ultimate goal is to help 100 people become millionaires.

235
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,360
That's the goal. And so I look at like, if that's the end goal,

236
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,480
how does everything that I do, the content that I post on my stories,

237
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,880
the things that I do in my Facebook group, do I even have a Facebook group?

238
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,080
What are the the the topics of discussion here?

239
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:11,480
What are the what what is my my inner community, my digital landlords program?

240
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,520
What does it look like?

241
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,720
How do I hold people's hand all the way to the finish line?

242
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,680
All of that is with the idea in mind, like, how do I get 100 people

243
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:22,000
to become millionaires? OK. And so for me, as I look at this group,

244
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,200
we just had to like we weren't getting a ton of people that were on the call

245
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,880
that I felt were serious. It was just dead.

246
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,360
And it was it was whatever.

247
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,560
And so we're like, all right, let's do this.

248
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,680
We may only get five people on this call, but it's a risk we're willing to take.

249
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,440
But for me, it feels like the best way that I can help you guys.

250
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,600
Is to work with you more intimately,

251
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,800
where you can ask me questions, where you can, you know,

252
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,400
the things that you normally wouldn't get access to, you will get access.

253
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:54,480
And this is the most intimate way that I can, you know, assist you

254
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,440
without you being inside of my program.

255
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,000
And so that's why I'm doing this.

256
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,280
That's why I'm going to continue to do this.

257
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,400
And so that's that's why we made that change.

258
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,200
So once again, if you guys stay on this call, for those of you

259
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,920
that joined a little bit late, we are going to be making a free resource

260
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,960
based on the information we present in this call on low ticket versus high ticket.

261
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,160
And it's it's going to be a digital resource.

262
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,920
And Aaron slash Donnie Dre are going to be distributing that to you guys.

263
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,880
You don't have to worry about commenting on a post

264
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,680
if we give a few extra copies away. OK.

265
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,600
Yeah, that said, let's go into low ticket versus high ticket. OK.

266
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,520
So, guys, I'm going to try to get through this part pretty quick

267
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,520
so we can get to Q&A, but there's a few things I want to just

268
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,880
highlight and focus on as we go through this. OK.

269
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,280
So let's just really quickly.

270
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,600
I don't want to assume anything.

271
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,000
I don't want to assume you guys have a certain level of knowledge.

272
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,360
I'm going to pretend everyone's brand new to this business model.

273
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,480
What is low ticket versus high ticket?

274
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,080
OK, I'm going to make this definition really easy.

275
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:55,000
Low ticket means the price of the service is relatively low.

276
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,800
High ticket means the price of the service is relatively high.

277
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,440
And I'm saying relatively because some things might seem expensive to some people.

278
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,280
Some things might seem cheap to other people.

279
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,480
But we're talking relatively speaking. OK.

280
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,040
What are I'm going to go over a couple of niches that fall into low ticket.

281
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,000
And these just came into my head.

282
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,720
I think, yes, these ones I'm going to mention are all ones that I have personally tried.

283
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,320
So we've got carpet cleaning would fall in low ticket.

284
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,160
Towing would fall into low ticket.

285
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,440
Cool cleaning would fall into low ticket.

286
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,640
Handyman would fall into low ticket.

287
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,840
Locksmith would fall in the low ticket.

288
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,840
There's another one I saw a garage door repair would fall into low ticket.

289
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,920
OK, these are some ideas.

290
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,520
These are some examples of low ticket. OK.

291
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,800
On the other hand, what are some some niches that would fall into high ticket?

292
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,240
We've got artificial grass.

293
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,760
We've got roofing.

294
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,280
We've got remodeling.

295
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,240
We've got foundation repair.

296
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,080
We've got pool construction.

297
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,560
OK, just to give you guys a couple of examples.

298
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,880
And to show you the differences.

299
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,760
Low ticket, high ticket, very simple.

300
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,480
One of them is high ticket for the client.

301
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:03,600
And typically that usually translates to more money in the business owner's pocket.

302
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,000
Not always, but most of the time, if they're charging more money,

303
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,680
they're going to make more money.

304
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,120
Some of these businesses have terrible margins,

305
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,560
but not usually these services we target. OK.

306
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:18,000
So I want to talk about the pros and cons of low ticket

307
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,400
and the pros and cons of high ticket.

308
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,840
Again, this is coming from experience.

309
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,240
This isn't like I read a listicle.

310
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,200
This isn't I read an article.

311
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,720
This isn't I talk to my buddies that are in the space.

312
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,640
This is these are my pros and cons from experience.

313
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,360
So let's talk about the pros of low ticket.

314
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,800
And by the way, if there's any pros or cons that you can think of

315
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,400
that I miss, please, by all means, drop them in the comments.

316
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,840
OK, so here actually start with the cons, because then we can end on the pros.

317
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:49,560
So the cons of low ticket, number one, lower retainers.

318
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,880
OK. And by the way, once again, luckily for you guys,

319
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,520
if you stay on this call, you don't have to take crazy notes

320
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,480
because we're going to create a digital resource

321
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,920
that's going to give you most of this information

322
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,600
that you're going to be able to go and have access to and keep forever.

323
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,160
So stay on this call.

324
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,680
But I'm going to go over these really quick.

325
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,240
So number one, low retainers.

326
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,040
There's not as much meat on the bone.

327
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,040
OK, if you're doing a tow truck deal

328
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,880
and it costs one hundred dollars to go and tow someone's, you know, car.

329
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:17,040
How much money could there possibly be for the business owner?

330
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,360
Well, they got to pay for their truck.

331
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,240
They got to pay for their gas. They got to pay their driver.

332
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,360
They got to pay their insurance. They got to pay for their uniforms.

333
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,840
By the time it's all said and done, if they actually look at the cost,

334
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,720
they're probably barely making 20 bucks on that deal.

335
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,320
So then if they split that with you, then what?

336
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,800
Every lead you're making 10 bucks.

337
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,560
So you do the math.

338
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,360
If they're on a hundred dollar deal, if you're making ten dollars,

339
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,200
they can share a hundred ten dollars with you.

340
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,800
How many leads do you actually need to get them to charge five hundred dollars,

341
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,720
which is not that much money? Right.

342
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:46,960
So there is low retainers, typically speaking.

343
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,520
Most often, it's low retainers.

344
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,560
Number two, again, this is my experience.

345
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,040
You can judge. You can call me a hater or whatever.

346
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,040
The business owners in these niches, not always,

347
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,120
but a lot of times are not as a business savvy.

348
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,160
They just don't seem to get it as much as the other niches. OK.

349
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,960
And I believe personally, because it's such a low buried entry

350
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,360
that people could just go start a cleaning company.

351
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,600
I mean, we could add window washing, right?

352
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,280
That's another niche that's low ticket.

353
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,200
And I've also tried literally today.

354
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,360
Lane, Mr. Benson Boone, by the way, I'm not hating.

355
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,200
I love the freaking cut.

356
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,920
I told Kyle, by the way, you do look like Benson Boone, so keep rocking it.

357
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:29,440
Lane today could go and drop over to Home Depot, buy some whatever.

358
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,880
No one even checks.

359
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,800
Buy some cleaning supplies.

360
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,560
Buy whatever a squeegee and a bucket.

361
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,640
And he could literally today.

362
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,600
Technically, he should go get a license, but technically he could.

363
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,760
If you want to go start knocking on doors today

364
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,920
and he could start a cleaning company, a window washing company. OK.

365
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,880
Awesome. That's really good.

366
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,160
The problem is anyone could do that.

367
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,280
And a lot of people do that.

368
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,000
And so in my experience, you don't get that many business

369
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,040
savvy people, because business savvy people look at the opportunity

370
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,080
and they go, hey, if I'm going to start a business and I can start

371
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,280
a window washing company or I could start a rank and rent digital

372
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,800
real estate company, huh?

373
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,760
Well, this one I could travel the world.

374
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,160
This one has crazy margins.

375
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,280
This one's usually a business savvy person isn't going to choose that.

376
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,640
OK, so in my experience, you're not dealing with as savvy.

377
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,360
I mean, especially towing.

378
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,160
I'm just going to say it.

379
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:22,760
Like I've dealt with some absolutely tough people in towing

380
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,680
and they just don't understand like what it is to put money into a business.

381
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,080
And get a return.

382
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,040
And it's it's really frustrating. OK.

383
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,720
Number three, con.

384
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,920
You're competing against what feels like a million other marketers

385
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,800
for the same leads.

386
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,720
I know in your head, you're like, well, low ticket should be low competition.

387
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,480
That's what I thought.

388
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,160
And it actually happens to be the opposite.

389
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:48,760
Carpet cleaning is one of the most competitive freaking niches out there.

390
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,680
If you don't know that, go try it.

391
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:54,360
It is very, very difficult in most markets to get a carpet

392
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,720
cleaning website to rank on Google.

393
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,960
And when I say competitive, I mean, cost per lead, how hard it is to rank,

394
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,960
how many competitors, et cetera.

395
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,520
Carpet cleaning. And that's not worth that much money.

396
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,000
There's not that much meat on the bone in carpet cleaning.

397
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,440
OK, so you're competing with a ton of other people.

398
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,920
Number four, you need to consistently.

399
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,320
Aaron, check the.

400
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,840
Yeah, you consistently need to produce

401
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,400
much more volume to satisfy the business owners.

402
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,760
OK, you need to just so many more leads

403
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,480
because there's not as much meat on the bones.

404
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,760
What about number five?

405
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,880
Low ticket requires just as much work as high ticket,

406
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,920
but you don't get charged near as much, right?

407
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,280
That kind of goes hand in hand with the lower retainer.

408
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,000
Number six, retention.

409
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,160
In my experience, retention is very difficult.

410
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,920
And you guys have probably heard this, if not experienced it.

411
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,400
But when you have clients that pay you a little bit of money,

412
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,240
they have big problems.

413
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,680
The people that pay you the least amount of money

414
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,400
always have the most amount of questions, the most amount of

415
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,960
they're the most high maintenance.

416
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,440
And I don't know why it is. It's bananas.

417
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,440
Actually, I do know why it is.

418
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,640
It's because that little bit of money means everything to them.

419
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,600
And when you go deal with big clients,

420
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,720
they're used to stroking ten thousand dollar checks.

421
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,040
They're used to spending, you know, having a

422
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,360
check that just came.

423
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,960
They need to write for a hundred thousand dollars in some cases.

424
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,560
And these amounts don't scare them.

425
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,840
But when you deal with these small guys,

426
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,080
five hundred bucks a month is terrifying.

427
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,600
That's that's a heaven forbid.

428
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,960
That's a cell phone bill.

429
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,520
That's another car payment so I can look rich. Right.

430
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,320
OK. And lastly, guys, and I know there's other ones

431
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,480
and you guys can drop them in the comments.

432
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,800
But it seems like a lot of these lower ticket niches

433
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,280
depend more on the GBP.

434
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,800
If you guys don't know what the GBP is,

435
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,240
that is the section at the top of Google.

436
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,320
Again, I'm going to go very basic for those of you that are new.

437
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,000
GBP is the section at the top of Google.

438
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,760
That is the map section.

439
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,160
It used to be called the GMB.

440
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,360
It was also called the three pack.

441
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,400
It's also called the map pack.

442
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,680
It's probably going to be called something else.

443
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,480
GBP Google business profiles.

444
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:51,520
Tow trucks heavily rely towing heavily relies on maps.

445
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,800
In my experience, carpet cleaning heavily relies on maps.

446
00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:01,080
Locksmith and guys from experience, from literally needing my locks

447
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:04,720
change at my at my house, I went to the maps and called the first company.

448
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,480
Like that's what I did. Period.

449
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,480
OK, so these these lower ticket niches seem to rely on the GBP.

450
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,280
And as you guys know, the GBP has become harder and harder to get.

451
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,880
Whereas these bigger niches, they don't they don't they don't they're not as much

452
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,680
because people are going to do a little bit more due diligence.

453
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,120
They're not just going to be like, yeah, I need my foundation

454
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,880
or paradigm and I call the first person on Google Maps.

455
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,960
They're going to look at the website.

456
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,520
They're going to do a little bit more due diligence.

457
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,520
They're going to make sure that like it looks credible. Right.

458
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,400
So these are the cons.

459
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,840
Now, there are a few pros.

460
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,560
Number one is a lot of times there's higher volume,

461
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,960
a.k.a. there's more leads available.

462
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,880
So when you're getting a deal and you throw on ads,

463
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:46,200
as long as the CPC is not too high, you're going to see the movement quicker.

464
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,520
Right. I remember having a tow truck website when I first started to do my strategy.

465
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,480
I was seeing leads come in every day.

466
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,800
Sometimes five, six a day.

467
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,600
And it's exciting.

468
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,720
And you get that little rush and that little dopamine.

469
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,880
You're like, oh, leads are coming in.

470
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,520
And I'm going to pass. I'm going to pass.

471
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,640
So that's good. OK, that is fun.

472
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,240
It's exciting.

473
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,680
So that's a pro. We're not going to deny that. OK.

474
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,920
Another thing that's nice about low ticket,

475
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:12,640
it's very rarely brand driven, very rarely brand driven.

476
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,560
I would wager to bet

477
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,880
you know, most of you guys, if you needed to get your windows washed today,

478
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:24,000
maybe, but I would doubt you would know like the top two companies in your city.

479
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
And if you do, it's probably because your cousin or your brother has a window

480
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,120
washing company. But apart from that, you don't know any massive companies.

481
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,960
You don't know. And it's because it's not brand driven. Right. OK.

482
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,760
Another another pro is the leads.

483
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,120
Oftentimes, but not always.

484
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,280
I wanted you to remember not always, but oftentimes the leads are cheaper

485
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,880
to acquire with paid ads. OK, again, not always.

486
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,520
But if you go and you look at like the cost per click on towing,

487
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,960
it's usually almost always just a couple of bucks.

488
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,120
It's not if it's above five bucks in towing dog.

489
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:01,440
That's it. That's that's rough because the money is just not there

490
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,600
to spend that kind of money.

491
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,480
The margins are there to kind of to spend that kind of money. OK.

492
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:10,400
So typically the leads are cheaper to acquire with paid ads. OK.

493
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:16,160
And lastly, as a pro is there always seems to be tons of business owners

494
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:19,840
to talk to. That's a kind of a negative thing because you have a lot of competition,

495
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,640
but it can be a positive thing because you have a lot of people to pitch

496
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,040
a lot of potential customers because it's so low.

497
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,400
The barrier to entry is so low. OK.

498
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:31,480
So that is low ticket for you guys again to review.

499
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:35,080
That's like carpet cleaning, towing, pool cleaning, handyman, locksmith,

500
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,720
window washing, pressure washing, gutter cleaning,

501
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,440
not gutter installation, gutter cleaning. OK.

502
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,680
These are just some examples of in fact, I'll add these

503
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,760
so we can add them to the sheet.

504
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,200
So we added pressure washing.

505
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,560
We added a gutter cleaning

506
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,440
and we added window washing just so you guys have some examples

507
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,720
for this digital resource we hand out. OK.

508
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,720
OK. Now let's talk about the.

509
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,400
Pros and cons of high ticket.

510
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,120
OK. And actually, before I do that.

511
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,440
And by the way, I've got about a few more things.

512
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,480
I just got a few more things to share that we're going to go to Q&A.

513
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,880
I want to tell you guys quickly about my first deal.

514
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,640
It's a two minute story.

515
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,720
Just so you guys get an idea.

516
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,760
So my first deal was towing huntsville dot com.

517
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,160
The website is still in existence.

518
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,320
It's awful.

519
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,640
It's hideous and it's hilarious, to be honest with you.

520
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,320
In fact, I don't own it anymore.

521
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,680
I've actually sold it since.

522
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:32,040
That's how much I don't like towing.

523
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,800
But if you want, it's towing huntsville dot com.

524
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,800
You guys can take a look at it.

525
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,760
It's in Huntsville. It's towing. OK.

526
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,920
I had I knew nothing about towing.

527
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,040
I didn't know any of the pros. I didn't know any cons.

528
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,040
No one told me the pros and cons.

529
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,600
If someone would have told me what I just told you guys about low ticket,

530
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,000
I never would have gone into towing.

531
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,960
I just heard people talking about towing and the group that I was in,

532
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,960
the program that I was in, didn't really give clear direction.

533
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,920
And I was like, dude, towing sounds good.

534
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,080
Let me just build towing. OK, why not?

535
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,320
So I built the site.

536
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,520
By the way, this is back when before I knew that you could pre-sells

537
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:07,720
before you could cheat the system and get a deal and have them pay for it.

538
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,360
But I was doing the slow method.

539
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:13,000
I built a site. I did the SEO.

540
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,120
I got lucky because I didn't even know what competition was.

541
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,880
It was just dumb luck. I swear to you, it was just dumb luck.

542
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,160
And I started getting a couple of leads.

543
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:24,920
And after sending these leads to a couple of different business owners,

544
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:28,040
I finally got somebody on the hook and I gave them way more leads

545
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,920
than I should have, like two weeks worth of leads.

546
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:33,040
Probably gave them like 30 leads, maybe even more.

547
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,640
And I did at the time I was doing door to door sales.

548
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,080
I was like in person, like in person is the best.

549
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:42,240
So I literally went to this tow truck like site.

550
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,360
If you guys have been to towing sites, it's like it's like where they murder people.

551
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,760
It's like a chain link fence.

552
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,040
There's literally dead bodies all over.

553
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,080
I'm kidding. But they look like that.

554
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,440
They have this usually a shitty little office.

555
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,920
And it just screams like money laundering. Right.

556
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,560
Like this is just kind of the vibe.

557
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:03,560
But I pulled up great Honda Civic in my door knocking uniform.

558
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,120
You know, when inside guns ablaze and do it, I actually put a deal together.

559
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,400
I got a six hundred dollar per month deal, made all the mistakes in the book,

560
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:15,040
set the expectations wrong, didn't met the business owner, didn't do auto pay.

561
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,400
Imagine the guy cut me a actual physical check that I walked out.

562
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,880
I was like, and I got a physical check for six hundred bucks.

563
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,520
It was like one of three checks that I got over the next six months

564
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,200
because I could never get into pay. OK.

565
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:30,200
As a side note, just to be fair, that six hundred dollars,

566
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,520
that first deal blew my mind.

567
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,240
It was euphoric, even though it was not the greatest deal.

568
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:38,760
And the reason why is because it was the first time that I saw

569
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,600
that this actually could work for me.

570
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:45,000
And I want you guys all to know that that I know you're sitting on this call.

571
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,040
Not all of you, but maybe some of you, maybe most of you, maybe all of you.

572
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:51,120
And you're sitting there going, yeah, that's cool, Nick.

573
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,680
It's cool that works for you.

574
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,400
It's cool that works for Ryan Dalton.

575
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,320
It's cool that it works for Juan Finesse and Eugene Song

576
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,800
and Patrick Rowland and Jerry Ward and blah.

577
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,360
But but but I'm different in my situation is different.

578
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,200
And I want you to know that we all feel like that.

579
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:10,720
OK, we all is as cocky and arrogant as I was when I started thinking,

580
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,480
who the heck is that guy? If he can do it, I can do it.

581
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,560
I had that thought.

582
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,840
But at the same time, there was that little bit of doubt, like,

583
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,200
I don't know, man, maybe I'm just not cut out.

584
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,080
Guys, I didn't know.

585
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,160
You have to understand, I did not know that

586
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,120
a domain was the WWW dot.

587
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,880
I didn't know that that's what it was called.

588
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,600
I just thought it was called a website.

589
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,400
I didn't know what SEO stood for.

590
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,360
I didn't know what a backlink was.

591
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,880
I didn't know that there was a way to write content.

592
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:40,560
I didn't know about Weebly or I sure didn't know what hosting was.

593
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,480
I thought that's what you did when you brought someone over to a party.

594
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,920
I didn't know anything.

595
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:49,120
Tracking numbers, I knew literally zero.

596
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,320
Like the extent of my technology, I think I had an Instagram account

597
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,360
that I kept deleting during the summer when I was selling

598
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,800
because I was distracting.

599
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,160
I like four posts on Instagram.

600
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,600
That was the extent of my social media presence and my online

601
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,160
technical experience. OK, so I just want you guys to know

602
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:07,360
when I got that first deal, it was like, oh, my gosh, I can do this.

603
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,440
And even though that deal wasn't the greatest deal,

604
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:13,200
I still remember walking out with that check, being in that Honda Civic.

605
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,800
It's like a million degrees in Alabama.

606
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,440
I'm sweating when I call my dad and I'm like, Dad, I just got this deal.

607
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:20,000
And I explained it to him perfectly.

608
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,560
And he's like, I could tell he was like, is this legal?

609
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,960
Like, this is a little sounds a little little sus.

610
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,240
You know, that's kind of the vibe. He's super excited for me.

611
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,760
But the thing about it was I was so pumped

612
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:33,920
because I at the time was trading my time for dollars.

613
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,000
And many of you guys, if not all of you guys can relate,

614
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,200
unless you punch the clock, you aren't getting paid.

615
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,960
Even if you're a salesperson, unless you are physically present,

616
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,480
you are not getting paid. And I was that person.

617
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:49,360
I did that for four years, knocking doors in the heat when I was sick,

618
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,240
when I didn't feel like it, when my marriage was having problem,

619
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,160
when my kids weren't well, I had to go out and get my mind right

620
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,160
and put in the hours or else I didn't eat.

621
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,000
And on top of that, I only got paid once.

622
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,200
I didn't get paid every month for these deals.

623
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:05,560
I got paid one time and then I had to do it again.

624
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,680
So that was I just want you guys to know that first deal

625
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,000
you guys are in for a treat.

626
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,440
And I would love to go back and unexperienced everything

627
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,480
that I've experienced and all the deals and the millions.

628
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,640
I promise you that first deal, it might have been sweeter

629
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,720
than the first million I made.

630
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,560
And I seriously mean that. It was amazing.

631
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:24,040
So I got my first deal in towing.

632
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,480
Now, the problem is I didn't keep the client.

633
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,200
I kept the client for six months, but I only got paid for like three

634
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,600
because it was like every other month they were not paying.

635
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,400
And I ran into a ton of the common problems

636
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,320
that you're going to run into.

637
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,240
So we started at a flat fee and then he wanted to go to pay per lead.

638
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,040
And me being stupid was like, sure.

639
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,840
And then we started highlighting, well, this is not a lead.

640
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,440
And I had to listen to phone calls.

641
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:50,360
And I realized his his call answering team was very rude, very unprofessional.

642
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,840
They weren't even trying to close deals.

643
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,880
And then we I mean, I spent so much time to get the six hundred dollars.

644
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,640
OK, long story short, I lost the deal.

645
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,840
OK, and I I think I signed one more guy and then I lost him.

646
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:06,080
And then finally, I signed a deal with a guy, a great business owner,

647
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:10,240
signed it, got a contract this time, did it on the flat rate for 500 bucks a month.

648
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,600
And I sold the site. I said, I'm getting out of towing. Done.

649
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,520
OK, that was my first deal.

650
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,680
OK, let's talk about high ticket really quick.

651
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,960
Pros of high ticket.

652
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:21,000
Let's talk with cons of high ticket. OK, here's the cons. Number one.

653
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,920
The competitors that you do have sometimes can be behemoths.

654
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,160
These can be titans of industry.

655
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,680
These can be 100 million.

656
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,000
And I don't I'm not joking.

657
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,400
These can be 100 million dollar companies that you're competing against

658
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:38,800
with marketing companies that they bought just to service their companies.

659
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,680
OK, these are the kind of you're going to get some high level people.

660
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,560
Not always, but it can be the case.

661
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:46,080
OK, so that can be a con.

662
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,120
Number two, if you pick the wrong city in high ticket,

663
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:53,880
you're screwed because it's almost always more competitive than low ticket

664
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,280
in terms of ranking.

665
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:59,080
I guess I wouldn't say always because low ticket is weirdly competitive

666
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,880
in some of these niches like carpet cleaning.

667
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:04,840
But if you don't get the city right, you are screwed.

668
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,600
It is going to it's going to take you all of your energy, all of your time,

669
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,360
all of your margin, all of your resources to rank that website.

670
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,880
And by the time you write the website,

671
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,200
you could have built five more in a better niche in city.

672
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,960
OK, so you have to.

673
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,240
I'm going to call it a con.

674
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,080
You have to there's no room for messing up.

675
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,960
You have to nail the city.

676
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,520
You need to know the right city, what it looks like, what the process is.

677
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:29,000
And I know some of you guys are in, I think.

678
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,640
So Lane, I saw a few names.

679
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,520
I'm not even looking at the picture, looking at my notes right now.

680
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,880
But a few of you guys just hopped into digital landlords.

681
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:41,040
I want you guys to focus very, very, very, very, very heavily

682
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:44,080
on the due diligence process because it matters.

683
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:48,920
OK, number three, in high ticket, the CPC tends to be higher.

684
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:54,040
OK, so you have to really do a lot of due diligence at times

685
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,000
to make sure that you aren't getting in over your head

686
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,560
and you're going to be spending too much money.

687
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:03,000
And guess what? Because the CPC is higher, your SEO matters that much more.

688
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:06,080
OK, when you're in low ticket and you're in towing, you know,

689
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,400
I've gotten deals before where it's a thousand dollar deal.

690
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,400
This is a real story. Thousand dollar deal.

691
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,880
And I could spend three hundred dollars on ads and I get a ton of leads

692
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,800
and I can make a seven hundred dollar profit split.

693
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,080
Boom. And some of you guys are going, why wouldn't I just do that?

694
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:21,720
Well, because the truth is, all the other cons, in my opinion,

695
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,280
don't make it worth it. OK, but I have done that.

696
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,960
And I literally did this with a towing site,

697
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:31,600
which is funny because five seconds ago, I said I got out of towing.

698
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:36,200
I got out of towing until I met a neighbor in my own city in St.

699
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:41,240
George that his or her son did towing.

700
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:45,200
And it just made sense for me to do because I already had the client.

701
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,400
OK, so I pre sold the client, basically.

702
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:50,080
So I do still have a towing site.

703
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,560
It's in St. George. And that's what happens when I first started.

704
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,960
I had the thousand dollar deal.

705
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,240
I ran the ads until it ranked. OK.

706
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,200
But the CPC will be higher in low and high ticket.

707
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,360
OK, the CPC will be higher 90 percent of the time.

708
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,840
So you really have to do your due diligence, as I said,

709
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,440
and SEO matters that much more.

710
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,680
So you need to nail the SEO because your margins

711
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,440
aren't going to be as good in the beginning, typically speaking.

712
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,760
So you're going to need to make sure that SEO hits. OK.

713
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,840
And lastly, another con that I believe is a con

714
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,840
is because these business owners are more educated,

715
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,560
you need to be sharper.

716
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,960
You need to know a little bit more what you're talking about.

717
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,920
You need to be more prepared. You need to be more polished.

718
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,240
You need to go in with a sales script.

719
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,720
You need to you don't.

720
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,400
It doesn't mean you need to have 15 deals.

721
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:35,760
And you need you don't need to have sales experience at the gate.

722
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,480
But you need to be scripted. You need to be prepared.

723
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,000
You don't just show up on a phone call with somebody that runs

724
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,120
a 10 million dollar company doing foundation repair

725
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:44,960
and think you're going to get the deal.

726
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,280
These guys are sharp. OK.

727
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,880
And they get hit up by vendors.

728
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,840
What I'm going to call us vendors, marketers all day long.

729
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:54,440
And so it's not the same as talking to Tommy, the tow truck guy,

730
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:58,240
who, like, is just not that smart. OK.

731
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:01,760
So I think it could be a con because it's a little more intimidating.

732
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:06,640
But I think overall, it's a pro because, oh, my gosh, I feel so much more.

733
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:12,280
What's the word edified after talking to somebody

734
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,680
that runs a 10 million dollar company than talking to Tommy,

735
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:18,560
the tow truck guy who does not just try to survive.

736
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,400
OK. And that's maybe that's bad.

737
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,560
Maybe it's not pros of high ticket. OK.

738
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,840
This is what I want to focus on the pros of high ticket.

739
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,240
Number one, we can charge fat retainers.

740
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:32,160
When I scaled the 20 in 2020 to 100K, I focused on high ticket.

741
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,680
OK, we could charge fat retainers because there's more meat on the bone.

742
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,560
It's plain and simple. OK.

743
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:41,080
Number two, this kind of goes in line with the first one,

744
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:45,480
but you don't need as many clients, meaning you don't need to manage

745
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,560
as many clients and as many problems and whatever.

746
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:50,400
You can manage a lot less to make a million dollars.

747
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,000
You don't need near as many clients with the high ticket niches

748
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,040
near as many deals to get to a million dollars a year.

749
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,520
OK, it's really not near as many as you think.

750
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,600
And one thing that people don't understand.

751
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:05,400
And I'll say this as a side note, is if you get a thousand dollar deal.

752
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,120
OK, which let's say that's your first deal.

753
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,120
It's it becomes this thing.

754
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:14,520
You get your deal and you kind of there's there was this moment with students.

755
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,680
And they're like, oh, my gosh, I just got the first deal.

756
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:22,360
And all I have to do is get 83 of those, which some

757
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,080
you might think that sounds a lot like a lot.

758
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:29,440
But when I had no money in my head, I was like, wait, that what I just did.

759
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,160
I'm making a thousand bucks a month.

760
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,920
You're telling me if I just do that 82 more times,

761
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,800
because 83.3 is times 12 is a million.

762
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:40,760
If I just do that 82 more times, I can become a millionaire.

763
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,800
I can a millionaire defined as making a million dollars.

764
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,200
I can have a million dollar business, dude.

765
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,480
I had a clear path to get there.

766
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:53,120
And so what I thought was I needed 82 clients, 83 clients.

767
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:56,040
But what I didn't realize is that I could go into higher ticket niches.

768
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,520
I could charge 2000. I could charge 5000.

769
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:02,000
And I also didn't realize that if I went after high ticket niches,

770
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,200
there's bigger there's bigger fish out there that you can chase.

771
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,200
That if you do a good job for, they are going to grow with you.

772
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,720
They are going to they are going to want to dominate an area.

773
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,440
And I had a client, I had two clients, one of them ballooned

774
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:18,160
from like a couple thousand bucks up to like eight, eight K per month.

775
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,280
And I had another client that started at a thousand dollars per month.

776
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:25,840
I accidentally called this client in an accidental niche because it was a lead

777
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,640
that came on the site in the wrong niche.

778
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,360
And I'm like, let me just call whatever.

779
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:33,400
And that balloon from a thousand dollars per month flat fee deal.

780
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:38,360
And one of the months that I was with them, they stroked me a $30,000 check.

781
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,360
So I'm telling you guys this because you sit there and you're like,

782
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,440
I only have a deal. I need 83 of these.

783
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,040
No, you don't.

784
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,360
You need to go and do brick by brick by brick.

785
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,600
But realize if you just take care of your freaking clients

786
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:52,360
and you'll do a good job and you'll deliver and you'll focus on providing

787
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,560
a service that's really, really good.

788
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,760
You're going to have clients that going to balloon into five, 10, 15, 20,

789
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:01,800
sometimes $30,000 clients, if you have a $30,000 client,

790
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,120
dude, you're you're over a third of the way there with that one client.

791
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,720
Now, there's other conversations.

792
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:11,120
I don't love having clients that have that much control over my business.

793
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:14,520
But at the same time, that's something you need to realize.

794
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:17,440
OK, another pro, this is what I also said.

795
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,600
They're more educated, they're more savvy.

796
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,400
You need to be sharper, which could be a con.

797
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,640
But also you just it's more exciting.

798
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:27,440
I love getting on and I'm talking to a business owner and they're doing big things.

799
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,160
They're making 10 million dollars a year.

800
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,240
That's somebody I want to know.

801
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,360
I want to know somebody.

802
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,400
I want to have conversations.

803
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,680
I want to have a Rolodex full of people that are millionaires.

804
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,640
And so for me, that's fun. That's exciting.

805
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:40,400
They get it when I'm talking about marketing and I'm painting the vision.

806
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,760
Hey, you're in Dallas and we're going to go to Fort Worth.

807
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,520
Then we're going to go to Arlington and work me and you.

808
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,280
We're going to dominate.

809
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,960
We're going to monopolize this area and they could see the vision

810
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,280
and you could see the vision and you could see your paycheck could be

811
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,520
and they could see the upside.

812
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,320
That's fun. That's exciting.

813
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,160
And I like that.

814
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,640
And you don't find that near as much in low ticket. OK.

815
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,840
There's three more quick pros.

816
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:02,400
Number four, you're not competing against near as many marketers.

817
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,960
You are competing against big dogs when you when you find competition

818
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,880
and if you go into the wrong city.

819
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:11,800
But it seems like the marketers, they all stay in the low ticket.

820
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,760
They're all terrified of low ticket.

821
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,080
And I don't quite understand why.

822
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:20,080
But you don't seem to bump into near as many marketers in the high ticket niches.

823
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:23,640
I don't really understand compared to these lower ticket niches,

824
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:27,360
at least in my experience, based on the due diligence process that I have

825
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,760
and the criteria that I have for picking a city. OK.

826
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,480
Second to last, you don't need to produce

827
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,280
near as many leads every month to keep them happy.

828
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,200
You can have months where you send them six leads.

829
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:40,360
And if you've set the expectations correctly, you're OK.

830
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,120
They're not high maintenance, not near as high maintenance,

831
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:46,040
because that's what happens when you charge retainers that are fat.

832
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:50,800
And also because they don't need to close that many deals to pay for your bill.

833
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:54,560
And they don't need to close that many deals to make the numbers make sense. OK.

834
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,240
And then lastly, again, this kind of bleeds into some of the other ones,

835
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:02,440
but they they they're just lower maintenance clients. OK, not all.

836
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,960
But if we're looking at 10 business owners and high ticket,

837
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,720
10 business owners and low ticket, I'm going to go ahead and put my money on

838
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,480
eight of the 10 of the the the high ticket are going to be low maintenance.

839
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:15,880
And two of the 10 of the low ticket are going to be are going to be high maintenance.

840
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,040
Unless I said that wrong, eight of the 10 low tickets.

841
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,160
I mean, you know what I'm saying?

842
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,800
The low tickets, more high maintenance. That's just the reality. OK.

843
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,640
So here's what I want to share with you.

844
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:29,520
One one last quick story about my first high ticket deal.

845
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,960
OK, and then I'm going to wrap it up and do Q&A.

846
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,000
My first high ticket deal was ironically my second deal ever.

847
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,080
So I got my towing deal and I just happened to to meet this guy.

848
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,800
I was selling door to door and I knocked on his door.

849
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:47,320
He wasn't interested at all in my my alarm.

850
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:50,080
I was selling alarm systems. He's like, no, no.

851
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,640
And I looked at his truck and I was like, what do you do for work, dude?

852
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:56,360
We had this weird rap and he did this thing called foundation repair.

853
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,520
And I was like, you know, I'm from St.

854
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:02,480
George, Utah. We don't have we don't have I'm sorry.

855
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,000
That wasn't foundation repair. It was a different service.

856
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,360
It was called crawl space.

857
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,440
It was called crawl space encapsulation. Right.

858
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:11,840
So we we where I'm from, it's only foundations.

859
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,720
It's it's just slabs. OK.

860
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:16,320
And so I never even knew what a crawl space was.

861
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,280
I was like, what crawl space? What?

862
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,080
And he started explaining to me this model and he even took me.

863
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,240
Imagine, guys, I'm in Alabama.

864
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,080
I'm supposed to be selling alarms. I'm tired of it.

865
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,600
He takes me in his crawl space.

866
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,600
I'm like, you know, this is like out of a murder scene.

867
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,760
He takes me. I'm supposed to be selling.

868
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:33,040
I'm like one of the the the managers.

869
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,480
And imagine I'm sitting in a crawl space like, look, let me tell you,

870
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,560
look how much cooler it is.

871
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,680
And it's I'm laying in a crawl space with this guy.

872
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,920
I don't even know. And this is where I swear to you,

873
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:43,920
they hide dead bodies in these things in movies.

874
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:44,920
And I just had this idea.

875
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,240
I'm like, dude, I do marketing on the side.

876
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:51,760
I'm actually like I'm completely like just blowing smoke.

877
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,960
I'm just acting like I'm way more important than I am.

878
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,160
Like, I think I could get you some leads.

879
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,560
And he's like, let me call my partner.

880
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,320
So I'm pitching him right there on the spot.

881
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,080
He calls his partner's name Ben.

882
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,400
And he's like, hey, I'm with this guy.

883
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:06,520
He walks out the side. He's like, hey, me and Ben want to take you to lunch tomorrow.

884
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:09,040
And I'm like, OK. And I'm like, see you tomorrow.

885
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,000
So I go home.

886
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,320
I will do all the research I can on this niche.

887
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,040
By the way, this was highly competitive, but I just went for it.

888
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,040
And I went I met these guys at Texas Roadhouse.

889
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:22,440
I still remember exactly what I ordered because I walked away.

890
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,720
I couldn't even eat. I was just too nervous.

891
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:28,200
And I went in like an absolute dummy.

892
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:31,120
And I pitched them at give me a thousand bucks to build a site.

893
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,000
And then let's do a hundred dollars per lead.

894
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,240
I didn't know paper lead.

895
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,440
Again, I didn't have a group like this.

896
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,440
I didn't have somebody like me telling me don't do paper lead.

897
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,800
But I went in a hundred bucks a lead, a thousand bucks up front.

898
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:44,160
And they shook my hand and gave me the thousand dollar check.

899
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,920
And I walked out and I felt euphoric.

900
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,280
Again, got a thousand bucks.

901
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,160
I'm the best salesman ever.

902
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:51,080
But again, this basically just fell into my lap.

903
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,400
It was by chance.

904
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,400
Here's what happened, though, guys.

905
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,880
It took me 14 months to rank that website.

906
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,160
I didn't know I didn't run ads.

907
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,040
I didn't know I could run ads.

908
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:05,200
I didn't know any of that took me 14 months to rank this website. OK.

909
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,800
And I think about how stupid that is.

910
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,400
I could have ranked three, four websites.

911
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,160
I could have got to ten thousand dollars a month by the time.

912
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:11,960
But I did it.

913
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,760
And I got it ranked and I plugged along.

914
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,960
I did the SEO and I made the mistake of doing the paper lead model.

915
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:21,240
And thank goodness these clients were actually good people and they were honest

916
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,520
and they were actually good closers.

917
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,640
And that's so rare.

918
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:26,440
So I actually did make some money from this deal.

919
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:31,520
And what ultimately happened is what always happens is it came down to like,

920
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,680
what's a good lead? What's not?

921
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,080
Oh, this is a duplicate lead.

922
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,160
What do we do about those?

923
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,400
You didn't answer the call.

924
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,640
So is it my fault or your fault?

925
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,120
And there became a little bit of that.

926
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:41,760
And on top of that, it became ultra competitive.

927
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,320
And my website, it was so much work to keep ranked

928
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,720
that it ultimately didn't become worth the squeeze anymore.

929
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:52,920
And so in both cases, in my low ticket example, my high ticket example,

930
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:56,520
I don't have either of those deals to this day.

931
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:57,960
Now, those were eight years ago.

932
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,600
And it is what it is.

933
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:02,640
But those were kind of like my extremes, like at the towing is at the low end

934
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,560
of towing or the low end of the low ticket.

935
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:08,480
And then the foundation repair is at the high like end of high ticket.

936
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,200
OK, here's what I learned from doing both.

937
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,920
OK, number one.

938
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,000
And I think I just barely said this exact same thing,

939
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,120
but I want to just recap on it.

940
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:21,040
But in both in both cases, I don't have a client, as I said.

941
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:26,920
And so the problem was, guys, is the low ticket.

942
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,040
Well, hold on one second.

943
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:31,160
Let me make sure that I there's one thing that I wanted to cover first.

944
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,360
They don't want to skip.

945
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,920
OK, no, I covered that. OK.

946
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:38,720
So what I'm going to do really quick, again, we have about 12 minutes.

947
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,160
If you have questions,

948
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:44,320
I'm going to cover one last little thing here.

949
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:47,160
But I do want to if you guys have questions on high ticket, low ticket,

950
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:47,960
drop them out.

951
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:50,560
And then in two minutes, I'm going to go to Q&A. OK.

952
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:53,280
But just one last thing of what I actually learned.

953
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,000
A couple of things I learned.

954
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Number one is not all low ticket niches are created equally.

955
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:05,280
OK. And what I mean by that as a side note is low ticket that is recurring.

956
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:07,360
Can work.

957
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,720
Pool cleaning.

958
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,040
I have a pool cleaner at my pool in the US.

959
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:14,400
I pay 130, 130 bucks per week.

960
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,600
OK, so 130 bucks per week times that by four.

961
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,280
That's five hundred and twenty bucks a month times that by 12.

962
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,880
That's that me.

963
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:25,040
I'm worth six thousand two hundred and forty dollars to my pool cleaner

964
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:25,960
every single year.

965
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:27,040
And he does not.

966
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,040
And he also charges me for chemicals on top of it.

967
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:31,520
And literally he comes. It's like a 15 minute appointment.

968
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:32,760
So he spends an hour.

969
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:34,800
He literally spends an hour a week.

970
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:38,000
He spends four hours a month with me and he makes sixty two hundred bucks.

971
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:40,200
It can work if it's recurring. OK.

972
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,840
Other thing is super high margin.

973
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,440
Low ticket can also work.

974
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:49,000
OK. Duck cleaning is a good example to get your ducks clean.

975
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,640
We're talking, you know, small houses is less.

976
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:53,480
But let's say five hundred to eight hundred bucks.

977
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:55,040
OK. One time deal. OK.

978
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,840
It's something that you should do every like six months.

979
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:57,720
Supposed to do it.

980
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,840
Typically, I haven't even done it at my house.

981
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:01,360
But these the margins are insane.

982
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,120
It's like 90 percent profit margin.

983
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:05,040
So the numbers can actually work.

984
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:09,920
OK. And thirdly is when I say not all low ticket niches are created equally.

985
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:14,080
Is low ticket does not always mean low competition, as I already stated.

986
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:19,280
In fact, some of the niches like carpet cleaning, low ticket is the most competitive.

987
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:23,960
OK. On the flip side, not all high ticket niches are created equally.

988
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:28,800
There is such thing as too high ticket, too high of ticket items.

989
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:32,280
OK. And what I mean by that is if you get too high a ticket, for example,

990
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:36,280
roofing is high ticket, but it's so high ticket, there's so much money in it.

991
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:37,800
Solar. It's so high ticket.

992
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,800
There's so much money in it that it's branded.

993
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,640
People are spending tons of money on branding.

994
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:43,320
People are spending tons of money on marketing.

995
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:47,560
And it costs a lot of money to rank your website, get leads from paid ads,

996
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:48,800
get leads organically.

997
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:52,440
And on top of that, these companies are spending so much money on branding.

998
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,640
It's hard to get leads from a generic website.

999
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:58,480
So the key is, guys, there's a sweet spot with these niches.

1000
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:02,160
And it's this sweet spot between, you know, it's kind of like the city location.

1001
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,120
Or sorry, the I'm sorry.

1002
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:07,160
It's niches is kind of like the city side, right?

1003
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,680
So with the city side of the location side,

1004
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:12,240
you don't want to just have the highest population,

1005
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:13,880
but you also don't want the lowest population.

1006
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:17,200
You want the lowest population with adequate search volume.

1007
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,360
That's the sweet spot with niches.

1008
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:22,080
You don't just want the highest ticket,

1009
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:26,880
but you want the highest ticket that's doable for you to rank.

1010
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,080
That's not so competitive.

1011
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:31,240
So there's like these sweet spots with this picking the city.

1012
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:33,080
And there's a sweet spot with picking the niche.

1013
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:36,080
OK. And so you want to make sure it's high ticket,

1014
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:38,520
but not too high ticket.

1015
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:39,280
It's high enough ticket.

1016
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:40,600
You can charge a pat retainer,

1017
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:44,440
but it's not so high a ticket that it's that it's attracting these behemoths.

1018
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,760
It's not attracting these huge, huge, huge companies.

1019
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:51,480
This branding, the billboards, the ad, the commercials, the TV commercials, etc.

1020
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:55,440
OK. And one more side note on the, you know,

1021
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:59,680
high high ticket niches aren't all created equally with high ticket niches.

1022
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:02,720
Like roofing, sub niches can work.

1023
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,760
OK, I saw someone put plumbing.

1024
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:05,680
I don't like plumbing.

1025
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:08,000
It's it's a little too competitive for me.

1026
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,160
However, the sub niche does work.

1027
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:13,560
HVAC changeouts, very competitive,

1028
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:15,880
but there are sub niches that can work off of that.

1029
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:20,000
OK, anyway, so that said, guys,

1030
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,480
lastly, I just want you guys to remember that on top of just picking

1031
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:27,720
like the you know, how high ticket it is,

1032
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:29,440
because that's what we're talking about.

1033
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:33,320
You have to keep in mind that for me to go into a niche

1034
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:34,960
has to fit other criteria as well.

1035
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:38,320
Number one, I still believe in going into tried and true niches,

1036
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:42,080
boring niches until you get to a point where you have, you know,

1037
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:44,480
retired, gotten out of your job.

1038
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:45,280
So that's number one.

1039
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,680
Number two is I still believe that has to be phone driven.

1040
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:50,880
Number three, I still believe it needs to be an unbranded niche.

1041
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,840
Right. It shouldn't be like a picture niche where people need to see

1042
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:55,000
a ton of your work.

1043
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,680
And I also believe that it should be recession resistant.

1044
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:00,360
OK. And I just want you guys to know, as we get into Q&A here,

1045
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:04,400
that if I were starting over tomorrow, I would be looking at niches

1046
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:07,560
that fit those criteria and that are in that sweet spot

1047
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:09,280
in terms of high ticket there.

1048
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:13,440
They're high ticket enough is probably the way I would describe it.

1049
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:16,160
You don't just want to go in the most high ticket

1050
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,640
because now you're attracting competition.

1051
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:22,280
That said, guys, as I told you one more time,

1052
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:25,160
if you guys are on this call, we're going to do like

1053
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:26,920
eight minutes of Q&A.

1054
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:29,320
If you guys are on to the end here in five minutes,

1055
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:31,480
we're going to screenshot everybody that's on

1056
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:34,560
and we will get you a digital resource with an outline

1057
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:38,840
of all of the notes from this presentation that is super digestible.

1058
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:41,600
And you guys can basically not take notes on it.

1059
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:46,160
So let's see what we've got in terms of questions really, really quick.

1060
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,760
And then also, if if we don't have any questions,

1061
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:51,520
I can start breaking down some of these niches and, you know, yeah, your name. OK.

1062
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:56,360
OK, Tara Wally says Tara Wally said the Senate is going to hope

1063
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:58,760
you can still send me the PDF and a link to the recording.

1064
00:48:58,760 --> 00:48:59,960
Could you also talk about home

1065
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:02,080
interior renovation in terms of the average ticket?

1066
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:04,280
I'm not sending the recording.

1067
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:09,960
Sorry, but yeah, Aaron can send you the the resource.

1068
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:12,080
And the reason I'm not sending the recording

1069
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:13,280
because I don't want it passed around.

1070
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:15,280
I want to reward you guys are actually on this call.

1071
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:17,360
Bravo poll says thanks in advance.

1072
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:19,120
Can you drop example of high ticket niches?

1073
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:20,960
Like, yeah, I think you said that earlier.

1074
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:21,720
We did that.

1075
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,560
Yeah, those are all high ticket

1076
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:27,400
concrete tree service.

1077
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:31,520
Yeah, masonry can be high ticket fencing.

1078
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,840
Artificial grass. Yeah.

1079
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:37,160
Who else was that you, Aaron?

1080
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:39,880
Yeah, yeah, like they're just like we listed there.

1081
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:43,400
You got any more? Yeah, I mean, I mean, I know this is this works

1082
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:47,200
in some areas is you're talking about some niches like roof repair

1083
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:50,400
can be less competitive, but still high ticket.

1084
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:53,280
But yeah, that's one that you want to some niche and very specific

1085
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:57,320
with the location and the margins on roof repair are good

1086
00:49:57,320 --> 00:50:00,120
because it's just basically labor.

1087
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:02,480
Makes sense. But no, it's a good point.

1088
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:05,400
Todd says, would you do air duct cleaning or duct cleaning as a keyword?

1089
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:06,440
Dude, I do both.

1090
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:09,920
And I'd look at the keyword research, but those my list.

1091
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:12,840
I know when I built my keyword list, my core keywords,

1092
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:14,120
I think I had both of those in.

1093
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:16,680
I would just look at your keyword research, see which one gets more volume.

1094
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:18,240
That's going to be your main keyword.

1095
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,160
That's going to be the one you want to use in your H1.

1096
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,280
It's going to be the one you want you want to use your page title.

1097
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,840
So that's hopefully that answers.

1098
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:29,440
Laura says the sales cycle factor into your low or high ticket, Nick.

1099
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:33,400
Yeah, some, but like I don't ever go into high ticket.

1100
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:38,080
Laura, basically what she's asking is if it's like a super long sales process,

1101
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:41,040
for example, when when someone's getting their foundation fixed,

1102
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:44,040
they're going to have a longer sales process than your tow truck.

1103
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:46,600
Right. If I get if I'm broke down right now, if I go outside

1104
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:49,040
and I got a flat tire, I got to get it fixed right now.

1105
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:50,760
Right. Like I could take an Uber.

1106
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:52,640
I might be able to get it fixed tomorrow.

1107
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,480
So I got to get that thing to the shop. Right.

1108
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:57,800
I mean, they're calling a tow truck or a mobile tire guy.

1109
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,960
And funny enough, I'm not fixing it myself.

1110
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:02,040
Just so you know, that's why that's not an option.

1111
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:05,760
That's immediate foundation repair.

1112
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:08,640
It's kind of a decision like the foundation needs to be fixed

1113
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,080
and it needs to be fixed soon.

1114
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:13,720
But today or next week isn't going to necessarily change anything.

1115
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:17,200
So it is nice to have those lower sales cycles,

1116
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:20,480
but it doesn't change what I choose to go into.

1117
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,760
Keep in mind, as part of my process,

1118
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,720
I send them leads.

1119
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:27,160
I don't wait for them to close a deal.

1120
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:28,160
I send them leads.

1121
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,880
I don't even necessarily wait for them to give estimates.

1122
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,960
I just send them leads so they can get a feel of those leads. OK.

1123
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:36,880
Lane says, I'm starting in concrete artificial grass.

1124
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,240
Can you go into artificial grass a bit more?

1125
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,920
I'm having trouble finding says, yeah, OK.

1126
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,800
So artificial grass is a great niche.

1127
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:44,760
That's why I like it. Lane is because.

1128
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:47,120
It is, I believe, recession resistant.

1129
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:51,400
We have cities like Vegas that are saying you have to have artificial grass

1130
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:53,880
for turf by this date, you know, or else.

1131
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:57,400
I'm sure California, if they haven't already, is shortly behind

1132
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:00,360
because that's how California is.

1133
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:04,120
They're professional at implementing these kind of like like paper straws,

1134
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:06,360
which, by the way, are the worst things that have ever been invented.

1135
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:11,360
Anyway, that said, artificial grass, just so you know,

1136
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:17,640
is the niche I used in 2021 to so 2020.

1137
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:21,200
My niche was tree service like my my core niche.

1138
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,280
Twenty twenty one was artificial grass.

1139
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:28,400
And I loved the niche because I got I was there was deals.

1140
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:29,880
I was charged twenty five hundred bucks a month.

1141
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:32,320
Like the numbers just work right now.

1142
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:36,280
The key, like like you're saying, is finding the cities

1143
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:38,600
because artificial grass isn't everywhere, right?

1144
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:41,240
You know, there's people that need concrete in every city,

1145
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:44,120
but there's not demand for artificial grass in every city.

1146
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:45,480
And so that's the key.

1147
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:48,520
And so what you also have to realize with artificial grass

1148
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:53,120
is you're going to probably have to go through more cities

1149
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:55,120
and be a little bit more strategic.

1150
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:58,920
You're going to need to do more front end work to find that one city.

1151
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:01,000
You might have to look at 50.

1152
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,720
And I'm not kidding. This may sound overwhelming,

1153
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:05,680
but you may have to look at 50 cities to find the one.

1154
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:08,920
But when you find the one, it's going to be a home run.

1155
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,800
And so it's kind of like, do you want the work on the front end of the back?

1156
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:15,600
And in my experience, I know when you're first starting,

1157
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:16,640
you want to get that first deal.

1158
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:19,880
And so sometimes you go into the back end work so I can get the money

1159
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:22,000
and I can get excited and that's OK.

1160
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:24,200
But where I'm at, because I've closed so many deals

1161
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:27,120
and I've dealt with so many clients, I'd way rather do 50 due diligence

1162
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:29,560
and then go into the right city.

1163
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:32,160
So also, Lane, shoot me a message.

1164
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,200
I know you're inside of our program.

1165
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:36,120
So I'll send you some other ideas as well.

1166
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:39,600
And if I could even say, Nick, real quick on that from my experience

1167
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:42,760
that when approaching like number one, just make sure you have the right keywords.

1168
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:44,800
So like you want to have that.

1169
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:47,400
We talked about this, obviously, in the program, but make sure you have

1170
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:50,760
the keywords have the most volume because you want to do variations.

1171
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:54,000
Just look, there's not only one keyword because some might get more volume

1172
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,440
than others. And then also, when you do, whether you're so much

1173
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:01,440
a good planner, like if you can also use strategy to help you

1174
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:04,320
create the keywords for each city, but you can do bulk inserts.

1175
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:07,480
That really helps you rather than just doing one city at a time.

1176
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:11,440
Love that. In fact, Aaron, you should make a video on that

1177
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,360
for our group and digital.

1178
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:17,520
Also, by the way, Lane, search inside of digital landlords

1179
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,720
for artificial grass keywords.

1180
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:23,800
And I've posted like the keyword, like I've already done the work for you.

1181
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:25,000
So you can look it there.

1182
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,720
OK, let's say like two more questions.

1183
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:31,480
Where does concrete sit in verse high versus low?

1184
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:32,880
Concrete's in that sweet spot.

1185
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,200
That's why I love it so much.

1186
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:37,560
The thing you're going to run into is it is going to be more competitive

1187
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:40,400
in the sense you're going to run into more marketers.

1188
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:42,120
Doesn't mean that there's not deals.

1189
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:45,800
And you guys go watch my YouTube videos like I've created like three.

1190
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:47,760
Just because you see a marketer or a lead generator

1191
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:48,720
doesn't mean you can't go into it.

1192
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:49,920
You just treat it like another website.

1193
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:53,080
But you are just know you're going to see other marketers.

1194
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,120
OK, that's just the reality.

1195
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:57,000
But it fits in that sweet spot.

1196
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Amy says, agree, Costco implemented paper straws.

1197
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,600
That's crazy to us boycott Costco. Kidding.

1198
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:09,280
Todd says, EG, like Minnesota, my home got some Minnesota folks on here

1199
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:11,840
and do not go in Midwest for artificial grass.

1200
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:13,600
No need. Yes, that's completely true.

1201
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:15,320
Artificial grass. Just be intuitive, right?

1202
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:19,240
Like Phoenix. Vegas, St.

1203
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:20,320
George, I have a St.

1204
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:21,360
George artificial grass site.

1205
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:23,160
I got my grass done at cost.

1206
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:24,840
I've made I make a thousand bucks a month.

1207
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:27,760
It's great. It's not even that big of a city. Florida's good.

1208
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:30,800
You know, it's getting more popular.

1209
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:33,120
That's what I like about it, is it's trending more popular.

1210
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:34,320
And I think it's resistant.

1211
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:38,520
It's recession resistant because of the laws, not because people are going to go,

1212
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:39,560
oh, I don't have much money.

1213
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:41,560
Let me just get artificial grass.

1214
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:44,760
But because of these, so I think you need to consider all these things.

1215
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:46,280
But yeah, Lane, just shoot me a message.

1216
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:49,560
We've got some more ideas, too, because there's just tons of niches out there

1217
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:52,120
that I think you could tap into.

1218
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:54,240
So awesome.

1219
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:56,840
Aaron, did you already do a screenshot of everyone that's on this call?

1220
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:59,640
I did. Beautiful.

1221
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:01,600
I don't know how we're going to get it to Discord user

1222
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:03,080
because I don't know who that is.

1223
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:05,760
Does Discord user want to hurry and drop their name in the chat

1224
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:09,520
so we can get that to them or they I guess they could also comment.

1225
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,080
Yeah, I guess that's the only person.

1226
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:13,760
Everyone else, I can see that. I gotcha.

1227
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:15,280
Cool. OK.

1228
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:16,960
Also, yeah, beautiful.

1229
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:19,840
So, guys, thank you for being on the call again.

1230
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:24,520
The purpose of this, like this just matches my goal.

1231
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:27,920
My end goal is to turn 100 people into millionaires. Right.

1232
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:32,080
And for me, I would rather help.

1233
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:33,880
How many we have on there? Like 10, 15.

1234
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:36,680
I'd rather help five people like deep.

1235
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:38,800
I'd rather go deep than wide.

1236
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:43,280
And I think you guys should take like just pay attention to what I'm doing there.

1237
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:46,440
And what I'm doing here is that like I would rather you guys go

1238
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:49,600
and get five clients and take super good care of them and grow with them

1239
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:52,000
and dominate with them and expand to three, four, five deals.

1240
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:54,640
You're going to get to your million dollars way faster

1241
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,840
than if you're getting a deal.

1242
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:58,680
You're getting the credit card, you're slamming it through

1243
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:01,360
and you're handing it to your VA and you're just chasing the next deal.

1244
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:03,040
Deep is always better than wide.

1245
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:04,960
And so anyway, thank you guys for being on.

1246
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:06,920
We're going to be doing this every Monday.

1247
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:09,600
Watch for the teaser post on Sunday.

1248
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:11,920
And the people that commented, the people that are active

1249
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:14,640
that I could see in the group that are getting deals that are sharing wins,

1250
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:16,840
they're going to get first priority on these calls.

1251
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:18,120
So thank you guys.

1252
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:21,960
We will see you next Monday and watch in your inbox from Donnie Dre

1253
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:24,880
for the digital resource.

1254
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:25,320
Thanks, guys.
