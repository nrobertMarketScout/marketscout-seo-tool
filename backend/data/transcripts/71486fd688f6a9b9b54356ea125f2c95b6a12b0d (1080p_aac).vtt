00:00.000 --> 00:09.120
Let's talk about building your actual asset in what you should use.

00:09.120 --> 00:12.360
Now I don't personally care what you use.

00:12.360 --> 00:16.880
It can be WordPress, it can be Wix, it can be Weebly, it can be any of the above.

00:16.880 --> 00:17.880
It doesn't matter.

00:17.880 --> 00:22.080
It can be Squarespace or whatever new thing they come out with after I recorded this video.

00:22.080 --> 00:26.080
It really doesn't matter, but what I want you to think about for a minute is this.

00:26.080 --> 00:32.520
Let's talk about a custom home builder and let's talk about a spec home behemoth like

00:32.520 --> 00:35.480
DR Horton or one of these national companies.

00:35.480 --> 00:39.760
Now the custom home builder builds a very beautiful pretty home.

00:39.760 --> 00:44.400
They go in, they get these customers and they're like, hey, where do you want the wall and

00:44.400 --> 00:47.520
what do you want on this one and how do you want the bathroom and they're these beautiful

00:47.520 --> 00:48.680
homes.

00:48.680 --> 00:53.120
But there's so much work into it, there's so much effort into it that they can only

00:53.120 --> 00:55.640
build 10 or 15 of these a year.

00:55.800 --> 01:00.040
Whereas a DR Horton, they're like, hey, we've got four homes and you can choose one of the

01:00.040 --> 01:04.600
four homes, you can choose one of the four finishes, you can choose one of these carpets,

01:04.600 --> 01:08.240
one of these paints and they knock them out and they knock them out and they knock them

01:08.240 --> 01:13.480
out and they knock them out and even though the DR Horton home isn't as beautiful as the

01:13.480 --> 01:20.600
custom home, I would love to see the guy that owns DR Horton, I would love to see his house

01:20.600 --> 01:25.560
and his bank account versus Mr. Joe Schmo custom home builder.

01:25.560 --> 01:30.120
So it's the same thing as McDonald's, in fact, fun little fact here, I was reading this book

01:30.120 --> 01:35.720
last night, The Cash Flow Quadrant by old Robert Kiyosaki, my boy and he was talking

01:35.720 --> 01:38.840
about this and he was talking about McDonald's, right?

01:38.840 --> 01:43.360
Could you or can you think of five or ten places that make better hamburgers than McDonald's?

01:43.360 --> 01:47.960
I can and I don't even like hamburgers but can you think of a single place that has a

01:47.960 --> 01:53.520
better system than the McDonald's that can churn out a hamburger that is the same hamburger

01:53.560 --> 01:59.560
here as it is in Ghana, West Africa or here as it is in New York City or here as it is

01:59.560 --> 02:00.880
in Australia?

02:00.880 --> 02:01.880
You can't.

02:01.880 --> 02:05.960
So the game is we're here to make money and we don't need to get emotionally attached

02:05.960 --> 02:09.080
to how these websites look because that's not where the money is, the money is in getting

02:09.080 --> 02:12.800
the phone to ring and getting another client and getting more deals.

02:12.800 --> 02:18.560
So with that said, I just want you to know it doesn't matter what you use, it only matters

02:18.640 --> 02:23.680
that you master what you do and you figure out how to do it quickly and efficiently and

02:23.680 --> 02:24.960
it converts, okay?

02:24.960 --> 02:29.400
So we are going to show you, I'm gonna have Francesca is gonna jump in here in just a

02:29.400 --> 02:30.400
moment.

02:30.400 --> 02:34.320
She's gonna show you what we use and everything that we're gonna teach you in these modules

02:34.320 --> 02:41.720
is what my agency Evergreen does and has done and has used to go from what we were doing

02:41.720 --> 02:44.520
which is almost nothing to seven figures.

02:44.520 --> 02:47.520
So I'm gonna let her jump in and show you how to get that set up.

02:47.520 --> 02:49.480
We personally use Weebly.

02:49.480 --> 02:55.060
Okay, so I'm going to show you how to create a designer Weebly account.

02:55.060 --> 03:05.080
So you are going to search for designers.weebly.com register and you're going to end up on this

03:05.080 --> 03:10.480
page right here and you're going to fill out this information.

03:10.480 --> 03:14.660
So we already have an account, I'm just going to show you how to create your own.

03:14.660 --> 03:21.540
Make sure you are on designer Weebly and not just Weebly, they are different.

03:21.540 --> 03:24.900
The designer one lets you do a lot more things in depth.

03:24.900 --> 03:26.740
So make sure you are on that one.

03:26.740 --> 03:29.500
So you're going to fill out your information.

03:29.500 --> 03:35.900
I'm just doing a quick, quick one and boom, pretty easy.

03:35.900 --> 03:40.320
And now I'm going to log it into our own account.

03:40.320 --> 03:43.120
This was just to show you how this one would be created.
