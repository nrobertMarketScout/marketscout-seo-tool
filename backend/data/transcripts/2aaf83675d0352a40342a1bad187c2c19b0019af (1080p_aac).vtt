00:00.000 --> 00:13.880
So guys, let's talk about the zoom clothes really quick and when to schedule it said

00:13.880 --> 00:17.480
I want to I want to reiterate and you know spring this up again.

00:17.480 --> 00:19.180
I've talked about this already.

00:19.180 --> 00:23.520
It's not when to actually do the clothes is going to be more of a gut feeling than it

00:23.520 --> 00:24.840
is an exact science.

00:24.840 --> 00:25.840
Okay.

00:25.840 --> 00:29.640
It's not you know necessarily after X amount of leads on this day and blah blah blah.

00:29.640 --> 00:30.640
It's not like that.

00:30.640 --> 00:31.640
Okay.

00:31.640 --> 00:32.640
It's you're going to feel it.

00:32.640 --> 00:33.640
You're going to know the customer is going to start saying things.

00:33.640 --> 00:36.080
They're going to start acting a certain way and you're just going to feel hey it's time

00:36.080 --> 00:38.800
to go and when the iron is hot it's time to strike.

00:38.800 --> 00:39.800
Okay.

00:39.800 --> 00:40.800
And sometimes it's going to be inconvenient.

00:40.800 --> 00:44.200
Sometimes you're going to be leaving for Cancun tomorrow at nine in the morning and you're

00:44.200 --> 00:48.360
going to need to wake up early to do the call close the deal and get to the airport on time

00:48.360 --> 00:49.360
and it sucks.

00:49.360 --> 00:50.360
Okay.

00:50.360 --> 00:53.320
But you know what it feels that flight is a lot better when I've made money than when

00:53.320 --> 00:54.320
I have it.

00:54.320 --> 00:55.320
So I deal with it.

00:55.320 --> 00:56.320
Okay.

00:56.320 --> 00:57.320
That's number one.

00:57.320 --> 01:02.120
The other thing I want to bring this up here is we want to make sure to send the screencast

01:02.120 --> 01:03.120
the night before.

01:03.120 --> 01:05.960
Want to give them at least 24 hours to watch this screencast.

01:05.960 --> 01:06.960
Okay.

01:06.960 --> 01:12.320
So let's say for example that tomorrow was because today is actually Wednesday.

01:12.320 --> 01:13.320
Let's say tomorrow's Thursday.

01:13.320 --> 01:16.080
We're supposed to do the call tomorrow at noon.

01:16.080 --> 01:17.080
Okay.

01:17.080 --> 01:22.480
I would want to make sure that my screencast was made and sent within at least 24 hours

01:22.480 --> 01:28.480
before and I would send them have it attached to a software that tracks it and I would want

01:28.480 --> 01:32.480
to give them 24 hours to watch this video but I would want to schedule it you know for

01:32.480 --> 01:36.080
tomorrow at noon and I would want to send it before 24 hours before.

01:36.080 --> 01:37.080
Okay.

01:37.080 --> 01:38.080
Very very simple.

01:38.080 --> 01:42.120
The other thing I want to mention is make sure that's actually kind of a bad example

01:42.120 --> 01:47.640
because I like to make sure and schedule my zoom closes either first thing in the morning

01:47.640 --> 01:48.640
or in the evening.

01:48.640 --> 01:49.640
Okay.

01:49.640 --> 01:51.560
Morning is always better but I'm talking their morning.

01:51.560 --> 01:54.880
So I'm you know mountain time if I'm doing someone in the eastern time I'm doing these

01:54.880 --> 02:01.480
calls early and the reason why is guys when you set appointments for their lunch break

02:01.480 --> 02:06.520
life happens man business happens employee problems and I got hung up on a job and blah

02:06.520 --> 02:09.520
and then they're just like do I really want to deal with this do I really want to take

02:09.520 --> 02:12.600
time out of my day to get pitched but if you do it first thing in the morning and it's

02:12.600 --> 02:15.640
like before they go out to work they're going to they've already agreed to it.

02:15.640 --> 02:16.640
That's a different story.

02:16.640 --> 02:17.640
Okay.

02:17.640 --> 02:20.280
On top of that when you do it in the middle of the day.

02:20.320 --> 02:24.640
What are they going to actually what are going to carry their laptop and catch you in the

02:24.640 --> 02:26.320
parking lot of a 7-eleven.

02:26.320 --> 02:27.320
You know what I mean.

02:27.320 --> 02:31.320
But at night or in the morning they're at their house they're at least on their laptop

02:31.320 --> 02:35.440
or even if it's their phone but they're sitting down and they're able to focus.

02:35.440 --> 02:38.600
Another great time to schedule these on Saturdays okay.

02:38.600 --> 02:42.780
For me personally Saturdays are a day that I work on my business not in my business and

02:42.780 --> 02:46.080
so for some of these business owners that's exactly what they do Saturday they don't got

02:46.080 --> 02:51.040
employees they don't have Saturdays they don't have employees calling them ringing

02:51.040 --> 02:53.440
them up customers aren't calling them as much.

02:53.440 --> 02:58.360
So Saturdays are also a really good time to schedule these last few things I want to mention

02:58.360 --> 03:03.280
here that are best practices is make sure to let them know like it's a very simple process

03:03.280 --> 03:08.400
some of these people they get really scared when you talk about zoom in a video call and

03:08.400 --> 03:11.200
just let them know say hey we're going to talk tomorrow what I'm going to do is I'm

03:11.200 --> 03:14.200
going to send you an email it's going to have a link and all you're going to do is it's

03:14.240 --> 03:16.920
really simple Mr. Business Owner you're just going to click on the link and it's going

03:16.920 --> 03:21.080
to take you to a video okay really simple don't stress it and by the way if we have

03:21.080 --> 03:25.620
problems we'll deal with it but it's not as complicated as it sounds so that's number

03:25.620 --> 03:31.520
one is I let them know that and make sure and we'll talk about this in future videos

03:31.520 --> 03:36.680
make sure that you can see their face and you can hear their voice because if I have

03:36.680 --> 03:40.260
to get on and pitch somebody that won't even show their face how do you think I'm going

03:40.260 --> 03:43.360
to get a credit card from somebody that won't even show their face okay.

03:43.360 --> 03:47.400
So these are just some of the best practices with setting up the zoom clothes and when

03:47.400 --> 03:52.640
to send the screencast so in recap set up the zoom clothes for morning or night when

03:52.640 --> 03:57.880
they're at home focused make sure they're at a desktop okay make sure that they understand

03:57.880 --> 04:01.080
zoom is going to be very simple it's going to be them clicking on a button make sure

04:01.080 --> 04:05.200
you can see their face make sure you can hear their voice and make sure they've watched

04:05.200 --> 04:08.920
the screencast that you just created that's 10 minutes or less that they've watched that

04:09.520 --> 04:14.440
or sorry at least 24 hours before or you've sent that sent it to them 24 hours before

04:14.440 --> 04:19.880
and they have watched the screencast before you get if you don't do this guys you're you're

04:19.880 --> 04:24.720
every one of these things that you don't do you can still close deals and you probably

04:24.720 --> 04:29.240
will still close deals by skipping steps but the more of these things that you do the closer

04:29.240 --> 04:33.840
to this process the higher the chance of you actually getting the deal
