1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
Can you go over why not PPL one more time in the fight?

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,520
Yeah, okay, so Josh, he's asking,

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,840
how do you get rid of the PPL objective?

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,200
So what I do during the screencast

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,360
and also during the close is I say,

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,280
all right, so as far as the deal goes,

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,880
we don't do commission, just so you know,

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,000
the reason why is there's literally

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,040
no skin in the game for you.

10
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,000
It doesn't work out.

11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,440
Nope, like you're not gonna have any incentive

12
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,320
to follow up with leads.

13
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,280
I don't wanna track it.

14
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,080
You don't wanna track it.

15
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:22,640
It's a waste of time.

16
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,920
I don't do that, okay?

17
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,040
And I'll say, and I always say that,

18
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,040
say what we used to do when we first started

19
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,200
is we watched Home Advisor and we thought,

20
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,680
now maybe we'll try the paper lead model.

21
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,320
And we did it because we thought it would be really easy

22
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,520
to sign business owners up

23
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,280
because they only pay for what they get.

24
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,360
But what happens, and this happens every single time,

25
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,600
Mr. Business Owner, and without fail, okay?

26
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,360
And this is why we do not do this anymore.

27
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,480
We haven't done it for years is there is a threshold.

28
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,560
So let's say that I'm sending you 10 leads

29
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,160
at a hundred bucks a piece just for easy math, okay?

30
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,080
And by the way, when you say that example,

31
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,680
use a high number so that they're already like condition

32
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,240
that it's high.

33
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,720
So let's say that I'm sending you 20 leads

34
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,080
at a hundred bucks a piece.

35
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,920
You're cool paying me two grand, okay?

36
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,280
Two grand within your budget, 2000, 2000, 2000.

37
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,440
But what happens when, Mr. Business Owner,

38
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,000
all of a sudden I go from 20 leads to 50?

39
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,720
You know what's gonna happen?

40
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,920
I'll tell you what's gonna happen.

41
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,680
You're gonna start complaining about leads

42
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,280
because you don't have the manpower to run 50 leads, okay?

43
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,640
So now you're gonna start not wanting

44
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,520
to go to certain zip codes.

45
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,040
You're not gonna wanna take certain jobs.

46
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,320
You're gonna wanna hire and raise your minimum price.

47
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,280
And all of a sudden, I'm not gonna make any more money

48
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,640
and you're gonna be complaining about it.

49
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,840
And we're gonna literally have this back

50
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,400
and forth every single month.

51
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,320
And you're gonna take out your red pencil

52
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,360
and I'm gonna take out mine.

53
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,680
It's a absolute headache.

54
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,440
So we do not do that anymore, period.

55
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,800
What we found is a lot better is we just do a flat rate.

56
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,960
And what happens is every single month,

57
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,760
it's the exact same.

58
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,520
We usually charge per week, by the way.

59
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,280
In December, this is a great place to introduce this,

60
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,200
by the way, in December, just so you know,

61
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,360
it is gonna be a little bit slower because it's December.

62
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,680
But the cool part is, is in the spring and the summer

63
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,400
and the fall, when it's higher than normal,

64
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,000
you don't get a knock on your door like,

65
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,440
hey, let's raise the price.

66
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,480
So that's why we do the flat fee.

67
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,160
So let me show you how we came up with your flat fee,

68
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,040
Mr. Business Hunter.

69
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,520
Here's what I call the lead value calculator.

70
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,040
Whatiseleadworth.com.

71
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,960
There you go, Mr. Josh Savage.

72
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,280
Boom.
