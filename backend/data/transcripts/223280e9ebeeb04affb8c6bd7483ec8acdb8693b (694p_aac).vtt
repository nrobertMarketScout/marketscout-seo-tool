WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.400
All right cool all right. Hey guys. We're here. Let me get on to my

00:12.320 --> 00:16.800
You go on to the Facebook account on my phone so I can tag everybody give me a minute

00:30.000 --> 00:33.280
There we go hi to everyone I think we're good

00:34.640 --> 00:40.240
Okay, that's gone through right on give me a second. Let me get out of this. I don't get

00:41.760 --> 00:43.760
crazy notifications

00:45.760 --> 00:52.960
Okay, all right. Hey guys, uh, we're in all right good deal the zoom is open

00:53.040 --> 00:56.080
Yes, it's open change the setting

00:57.120 --> 00:57.920
Yeah

00:57.920 --> 01:04.320
All right, man, you guys got questions. Come on zoom type them in the chat here and we'll get going. Okay?

01:15.840 --> 01:17.840
Okay

01:23.280 --> 01:28.580
All right, uh, well I wait for some people to hop in i'm just I got some notifications from last night

01:43.840 --> 01:45.840
Oh, hopefully those guys are

01:46.400 --> 01:49.120
Okay are hopping on good deal

01:50.080 --> 01:52.080
Who we got there? Oh, hey josh, how's it going?

01:52.560 --> 01:57.120
Good. How are you doing? Jeff? Good, man. Good. Good. How can I help you with?

01:58.560 --> 02:02.720
Yeah, I would love your help on looking at these ads that i've got running

02:03.600 --> 02:05.120
for a

02:05.120 --> 02:09.200
Friend and a client at the same time. It's in the windows niche

02:09.920 --> 02:10.800
and

02:10.800 --> 02:12.800
installation or cleaning

02:13.180 --> 02:15.040
installation

02:15.040 --> 02:17.040
Yeah

02:17.040 --> 02:18.880
so I

02:18.880 --> 02:21.360
Picked him up as a just to help out with his

02:22.640 --> 02:24.080
ads

02:24.080 --> 02:28.720
Originally before I even jumped in this program. So looking at what it would look like maybe now

02:28.720 --> 02:31.440
I probably wouldn't have jumped into this specific niche

02:31.980 --> 02:35.520
Thankfully, it's it's still um, he's fronting the ad spin

02:35.520 --> 02:41.360
so i'm not trying to do a lead gen for him just trying to help run this i'm trying to make it more efficient and

02:41.840 --> 02:46.800
Help him bring more leads in getting some clicks, but we're just not getting many phone calls or conversions

02:46.800 --> 02:52.240
So i'm assuming that some of the words that i'm targeting and maybe even the landing page i've got are not

02:53.200 --> 02:55.360
With the best for conversions. So okay

02:59.040 --> 03:02.340
You should be able to share your screen, I think I changed that setting, okay

03:12.240 --> 03:15.520
All right, can you see my screen? Yes

03:16.320 --> 03:18.240
Okay, great

03:18.240 --> 03:21.040
So here's what we're looking at as far as the ads go

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
To the ads account

03:24.400 --> 03:26.400
Yes, now I can

03:29.120 --> 03:35.760
How long has that been running for what's the start date on that start date was uh, january 28th, okay, so about a month

03:35.840 --> 03:37.840
Okay, good deal

03:38.240 --> 03:43.360
And fort worth is how many people again? It's it's a big city, right? Fort worth is about

03:43.980 --> 03:45.980
900 000 or maybe a million

03:46.720 --> 03:49.280
Big ass city to be running campaigns. Okay

03:50.080 --> 03:52.320
All right. What's your like daily budget?

03:53.440 --> 03:55.440
Daily budget is sitting at

03:56.160 --> 03:58.160
Going here real quick

04:00.320 --> 04:02.480
I believe it's about 32 a day

04:03.600 --> 04:08.400
Hmm. What's cpc for window installation? I would imagine it's bigger. It's pretty

04:09.120 --> 04:10.160
it's

04:10.160 --> 04:16.880
Probably over ten dollars. I'd imagine it can range. Yeah, it's usually about anywhere from 25 to 30

04:17.200 --> 04:20.560
Or to 50. It can be even more than that depending on the city

04:21.600 --> 04:27.200
I'm not i'm targeting different pockets the rural radius bubbles around three different counties

04:28.320 --> 04:34.000
Which is a lot of area to spread through but trying to make it a little bit more specific to these certain cities that I think

04:34.080 --> 04:36.400
That you could try drum up some business in

04:37.040 --> 04:39.280
Okay. Yeah, two dollars a day

04:40.480 --> 04:46.720
Okay. Yeah, and if something's like 20 you're not even yeah, okay, that's that's a big issue already. Okay

04:47.760 --> 04:48.720
um

04:48.720 --> 04:50.720
We'll go get into that. Um

04:50.800 --> 04:53.200
one thing about the radius since you said that it's just

04:53.920 --> 04:55.920
just be aware that like

04:55.920 --> 04:58.400
You know, even if you do like a three mile bubble or whatever

04:59.360 --> 05:05.680
Like that line that you see in the map like that's not like that doesn't like cut on a street or something any

05:06.480 --> 05:09.600
Any zip code that that touches it runs adds to that whole zip code

05:10.160 --> 05:13.520
So if you're in a big metro area and you're touching other zip codes

05:13.760 --> 05:17.120
That could be an extra 100 000 people or whatever lives in that area

05:17.200 --> 05:21.600
So it's just something to be mindful of sometimes in the bigger areas when you want to be specific

05:21.680 --> 05:26.480
You're better off putting zip codes or like whatever those little mini cities are

05:27.280 --> 05:29.280
Type of thing. Okay

05:29.280 --> 05:32.240
Okay, I can see that as already being a big piece of it

05:32.880 --> 05:34.880
Yeah, okay

05:40.320 --> 05:41.680
Would you like me to show you

05:41.680 --> 05:45.200
Yeah, go ahead. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to sidetrack you but I just when you said those things

05:45.280 --> 05:50.880
I was like, let's just jump right into that because I know I love it. I can almost tell you that's that's an issue already

05:52.400 --> 05:56.160
Yeah, so if I click into here you can see some of the the the locations

05:56.880 --> 05:59.200
Right to see you what where i'm looking at

06:00.400 --> 06:02.400
As soon as it loads that is

06:02.880 --> 06:06.800
It's always slow and it's always slow in your own life. So don't worry about it. Okay

06:07.680 --> 06:09.520
When it comes to those radiuses I can change them

06:09.520 --> 06:14.320
I was doing zip codes for a minute and then realized like I have to double down on this

06:14.320 --> 06:16.480
But I mean even Arlington's a humongous city

06:16.480 --> 06:22.080
So a radius in a certain part of Arlington is not going to be nearly as effective like to your point

06:22.160 --> 06:24.880
So these are these giant metro areas

06:25.600 --> 06:27.600
Dude i'm working on

06:27.760 --> 06:30.880
And yeah, you're probably running your ads to a couple million people

06:31.680 --> 06:36.400
So I just need to I need to make it smaller a lot smaller or more precise

06:36.800 --> 06:42.480
Yeah, and I mean, you know, I don't again whatever the cpc is that you're seeing like

06:43.280 --> 06:49.360
I I don't really there's a whole window installation is not something for what we're teaching

06:50.880 --> 06:54.240
As people shop for it, right they don't just go come over

06:56.000 --> 07:00.480
So if you're going to run ads for it, it's a little more complicated than getting

07:02.640 --> 07:04.640
Just kind of what we teach

07:05.600 --> 07:07.600
But I would tell like

07:07.600 --> 07:11.840
Without even looking at numbers like I would tell your friend you want to give me six grand

07:11.920 --> 07:14.160
I'll do it. You want to give me eight grand? I'll do it

07:14.800 --> 07:17.440
Other than that, that's a month. If not, i'm out

07:18.880 --> 07:24.000
Got it. So and I that's just I don't even know the numbers. I could just think that that's what it would take

07:25.520 --> 07:29.120
And that would maybe give you like fifteen hundred dollars and money to pocket

07:30.000 --> 07:33.760
Yeah, okay. So that that's just off the top of my head

07:33.920 --> 07:35.520
but um

07:35.520 --> 07:38.640
it's like I had a client that is wanting to

07:41.440 --> 07:46.240
Expand into like commercial roofing jobs, which is a whole different beast than like roofing

07:46.880 --> 07:48.000
and

07:48.000 --> 07:48.800
And I was like, okay

07:48.800 --> 07:52.640
Well, you know and they where they live is not close to a metro area

07:53.120 --> 07:56.960
And i'm like, I can't rank your website from where you're at into this metro area

07:57.360 --> 08:00.720
Unless you want to give me some offices for google business profiles

08:01.440 --> 08:07.440
Um, and I said if you want to run ads like that sale it's all about the sales cycle with these ads so like

08:08.000 --> 08:14.320
You talk to your buddy about what's your sales cycle like like when you get somebody how many touches does it take for him to convert?

08:15.680 --> 08:19.280
Now imagine no one even knows who the hell he is, right? So now it's like

08:20.480 --> 08:25.360
This is this is the type of sales cycle where because window replacement is expensive

08:26.080 --> 08:27.920
It's typically not

08:27.920 --> 08:33.600
Unless you just want to do glass replacement for broken windows. That's something that you can maybe do what we do for

08:34.160 --> 08:38.800
Right, but if that's not what he's wanting to get he's probably wanting to do big jobs, right?

08:39.360 --> 08:40.800
Um is yeah

08:40.800 --> 08:46.160
Okay, so that sale cycle is going to take multiple touches. So what we're what we teach here isn't going to be

08:47.360 --> 08:49.360
As helpful for him

08:50.080 --> 08:52.080
You're going to have to look at

08:52.240 --> 08:54.880
Social media branding ads with retargeting

08:55.440 --> 09:01.520
Facebook pixels display ads with retargeting from google and google search ads that we that we run

09:02.800 --> 09:05.440
And basically he needs to be branded

09:05.840 --> 09:11.600
He's going to need if someone's looking for him or that type of service and they come across his ad

09:12.000 --> 09:18.240
Or his facebook thing you have to build multiple ads that will touch that person probably seven eight nine times

09:18.720 --> 09:23.040
Before maybe they even come visit your site and that's why I said right off the top of my head

09:23.120 --> 09:24.720
I'd be telling the guy

09:24.720 --> 09:28.480
Six to eight thousand dollars a month minimum if he's not interested. I'm not interested

09:29.040 --> 09:31.040
Because it's not worth my time or frustration

09:32.160 --> 09:33.440
Yeah, and that's what it's felt like

09:33.440 --> 09:37.680
It's been more of a frustration for me because I want to help him get some of these things going

09:38.000 --> 09:41.680
But our budget is too tiny for these areas. He wants to and to your point

09:42.480 --> 09:46.640
Being able to really retarget everybody once they've seen something first to be known

09:47.360 --> 09:49.360
Is not happening, you know, so

09:49.680 --> 09:54.320
Yeah, that's like the commercial roofer like this. He wants to do these things and then i'm like, I don't even know

09:54.400 --> 09:55.440
I haven't even looked into it

09:55.440 --> 09:59.360
But i'm like probably anywhere between six and ten grand a month if you want to do it

10:00.000 --> 10:03.680
And you know, he's like, oh that's a lot of money and i'm like, well, that's what those it's

10:04.080 --> 10:07.840
That's not you know, someone's gonna drop like a couple hundred thousand dollars on a roof job

10:08.240 --> 10:10.720
Like they're not just searching google and clicking a button

10:11.920 --> 10:15.840
You know, there's a whole branding to it. There's a whole like social proof to it like

10:16.320 --> 10:18.800
i'm it's the same thing that nick talks about it's like

10:19.280 --> 10:23.120
why we don't recommend kitchen remodeling or home remodeling things like that because

10:23.600 --> 10:26.800
That's not something that somebody calls for someone to come do something simple

10:27.520 --> 10:31.440
And and windows could be that way too because well what type of window?

10:31.760 --> 10:36.320
What do I I want to you know, maybe the wife wants to come look at it and see it in a store and

10:36.800 --> 10:41.520
You know, how does it open? What latch is it all those things? So it's a sale cycle. That's not like

10:42.080 --> 10:45.200
Hey, my water heater broke or hey, I want to get my backyard

10:45.840 --> 10:47.840
some concrete in it or

10:49.200 --> 10:56.080
You know like emergency hvac repair like it's not something that's like a quick easy sale cycle like I need help now

10:56.720 --> 10:58.160
type of thing or

10:58.160 --> 11:00.160
This is such a lower

11:00.240 --> 11:03.200
Like it's such a low cost item that i'm not really worried about

11:04.000 --> 11:06.160
Like shopping around for the best best person

11:06.960 --> 11:08.080
right

11:08.080 --> 11:12.720
Yeah, so I I know that when I talked with this this friend of mine he was saying that his

11:13.680 --> 11:17.680
Average cost is anywhere from six to eight grand for the windows job, right?

11:17.680 --> 11:21.360
So that's usually what he would pay or get paid to do the windows

11:21.600 --> 11:24.880
So in my head, I thought oh, that's a great like, you know, it's high ticket

11:24.960 --> 11:31.200
But it's not I had to get over 15 grand like nick teaches. So you how do I move forward?

11:31.200 --> 11:36.000
How do I best delineate between those two and know that i'm not getting into an industry?

11:36.000 --> 11:40.320
That's just gonna like take my my breakfast and run with it. Yeah

11:42.720 --> 11:48.480
If you're not familiar with like uh, like I mean this happens i've i've done this a lot and I'm kicking myself

11:48.560 --> 11:50.560
like trying to help friends out

11:51.360 --> 11:53.360
but um

11:54.160 --> 12:01.120
It's just kind of like just like if you don't understand the process like or what the niche is and you just need to ask if you

12:01.680 --> 12:05.040
I get I look at it like this. I was like like I own a home

12:06.320 --> 12:09.120
There's services that I need I kind of like think about

12:09.840 --> 12:16.480
How would I find this person I might ask friends hey if you needed if I don't know i'll ask questions for like other people

12:17.040 --> 12:21.120
um, or go on the chat groups and find like how do you do this or

12:21.680 --> 12:23.920
You know, how would you find this person or whatever?

12:24.240 --> 12:28.800
Um, and then sometimes it's the business owner. You just go. Okay. I hear you. I get it

12:28.800 --> 12:32.640
Like what what's your typical sales cycles like like how does somebody find you?

12:33.360 --> 12:35.840
How many times you have to talk to them like, you know, it's like that

12:35.920 --> 12:39.040
We talk about qualifying them and you what's your close rate?

12:39.120 --> 12:41.920
Like if I gave you 10 leads, how many can you think you'd close?

12:42.640 --> 12:43.520
right

12:43.520 --> 12:46.880
most people if I do 70 you're like bullshit, but if they're like

12:47.680 --> 12:50.720
Yeah, I could probably close like, you know, four or five people. You're like, okay

12:51.200 --> 12:55.280
a little more like that person might understand that there's a cycle to their business and

12:55.760 --> 12:58.080
you know, not everyone's an amazing salesperson, but

12:59.440 --> 13:05.360
It's those kind of questions. You just gotta you just gotta kind of qualify them better and more and understand like what?

13:06.240 --> 13:10.960
Is there a sales cycle and then you got to think about what we're teaching and what we're trying to identify with

13:11.600 --> 13:12.720
um

13:12.720 --> 13:16.640
You know again, fort worth large ass area arlington large area

13:17.200 --> 13:18.640
uh

13:18.640 --> 13:23.040
You're running the just looking at that. I bet you're running that ad to like three million people

13:23.600 --> 13:26.240
Nothing's working for 32 dollars a day at three million people

13:26.880 --> 13:33.200
Yeah, like zero things are going to work for us on that. So you're going to get crappy clicks crappy leads

13:34.160 --> 13:35.520
um

13:35.520 --> 13:37.440
you have a pretty high impression count which

13:38.320 --> 13:44.880
Could be possible, but I bet your display ads might be selected or google search partners. Maybe by mistake

13:45.120 --> 13:47.120
That's that's something to think about

13:47.680 --> 13:52.000
But again, just yeah, this is like, uh, this is something that's not really

13:52.640 --> 13:54.640
What we would want to run here

13:54.720 --> 13:58.320
Um, like I said, it's a multi-touch multi-branded

13:59.260 --> 14:01.600
multifaceted different platforms retargeting

14:02.160 --> 14:04.640
Website pixels like it's a more complicated

14:05.920 --> 14:08.080
Basket that you're weaving the catch leads in

14:09.360 --> 14:11.200
So if I if you were in my shoes

14:11.200 --> 14:16.480
Would you go ahead and just make these ads like really specific to like one or two cities?

14:16.880 --> 14:21.600
With those zip codes instead maybe in an area where the cpc is more in that line

14:21.600 --> 14:24.800
That should be or would you just reach out to the owner and be like hey man

14:24.880 --> 14:28.160
Like I just want you to know this is probably not going to be worth your time

14:28.480 --> 14:30.480
Um

14:31.920 --> 14:38.080
Yeah, I definitely would like get rid of the radiuses and target better spots

14:40.960 --> 14:42.960
And see if you can make something work

14:43.440 --> 14:46.400
But yeah, I would just not have high expectations for them

14:46.720 --> 14:51.040
And I would also tell them you have the data to show you what cpc is

14:51.440 --> 14:54.720
There's no reason to be at 32 dollars a day. That's not even one click

14:55.680 --> 15:02.000
So you want to set yourself up for you know, how many clicks a day to win one click a day is going to do nothing

15:02.640 --> 15:04.960
That's like having one customer walk into your door

15:05.440 --> 15:07.280
If you were selling t-shirts

15:07.280 --> 15:11.840
If you're at a store that you know sold clothing one person a day is not going to do it, right?

15:12.080 --> 15:18.960
You need multiple people because not everyone's going to buy some are just browsing and leaving browsing and leaving but some people will buy

15:19.200 --> 15:21.840
So you need a lot you need more people coming to you

15:22.400 --> 15:28.000
If you look at it like a store you need to get more people to you and to do that with google ads you have to set

15:28.080 --> 15:35.040
Up the appropriate daily budget and an appropriate monthly budget to allow you to even bring customers into the door

15:36.080 --> 15:41.360
If you don't you're already just saying I don't want I don't want to make money here. I don't I don't want to have success here

15:42.000 --> 15:44.480
So some of that's just being just looking at the numbers

15:45.040 --> 15:49.200
And it's uncomfortable. I mean like this commercial this guy that wants to do commercial roofing

15:49.600 --> 15:54.160
I know I know he's not going to but i'm not going to try to make it work for him for five bucks

15:54.240 --> 15:56.800
Like you're out of your freaking school. I'm not doing that

15:56.800 --> 15:59.680
I'm not going to put myself in that position make me look bad

16:00.160 --> 16:05.440
Get friction with my friend or my client at all. I'm like, hey, no, this is what it's going to cost to do that

16:06.160 --> 16:09.600
I don't want to like if you're not if you're not willing to invest that i'm not

16:10.000 --> 16:13.840
Because now we're going to be in this spot where you have to like now go. Hey dude, this isn't working

16:14.160 --> 16:16.160
and it's uncomfortable and it feels weird, but

16:16.800 --> 16:19.040
That's just the nature of this like you just got to be

16:20.000 --> 16:22.560
This is just maybe talk to more about a cell cycle

16:23.120 --> 16:28.720
Maybe try to target a couple of those smaller like suburbs and just try to fish in there and make it work for him

16:29.120 --> 16:31.840
But look at your numbers in your search volume and determine

16:32.640 --> 16:36.400
What you think what you know a daily budget should be and a monthly budget

16:36.960 --> 16:39.440
um, one of the things that i've talked about

16:40.720 --> 16:42.560
before with people is like

16:42.560 --> 16:46.720
This is like this isn't like a rule like that you can like you'll find on the internet

16:46.800 --> 16:48.880
I'm sure there's people that have different opinions on it

16:49.840 --> 16:54.080
But like for me when i'm not sure and i'm like, well, I don't know. What's the daily budget going to be?

16:54.160 --> 16:56.800
What's the monthly budget what I like to do is I like to take

16:57.680 --> 16:59.440
the search volume

16:59.440 --> 17:02.080
From like what I find in rare keyword planner

17:02.880 --> 17:06.480
the monthly search volume and I add that up and then

17:06.880 --> 17:08.320
Um

17:08.320 --> 17:12.640
I add that number up and then I divide and then I find like 75% of that

17:13.040 --> 17:16.880
And and the goal and so the thought is that well, I want to try like like I said

17:16.960 --> 17:20.880
I want to bring customers into my door to buy my t-shirt. I need to get a lot so

17:21.440 --> 17:27.600
Out of a hundred people that walk by my store. I want to get like 70 75 of them in my store. Does that make sense?

17:28.240 --> 17:31.200
So that's so that's where that number comes from and it's just a number

17:31.280 --> 17:35.440
I just it just seems to work and then I look at my my uh,

17:36.480 --> 17:41.360
My top of page my highest bid cpc and then I multiply those two numbers together

17:41.840 --> 17:45.440
That should give me a monthly budget and then I divide that by 30

17:47.040 --> 17:50.400
And there and there's your and there's your daily budget and if you set them up like that

17:50.800 --> 17:57.440
That's an easy way you can you can dive in and tweak things and get rid of fort worth and you know

17:57.520 --> 17:59.200
You can make that smaller

17:59.200 --> 18:04.800
But like but you're always going to do it with data and a little more confidence and then by doing it that way

18:05.120 --> 18:07.200
Even if the friend's like, oh, that's too expensive cool

18:08.640 --> 18:12.960
Not my problem. That's not my problem. If you don't want to spend money to make money, that's not my problem

18:13.200 --> 18:15.200
That's a you problem. Not me problem, right?

18:16.000 --> 18:23.120
Hey jeff. Yeah, can you can you go through that formula again? My my laptop cut out when you were saying it. Nope

18:24.320 --> 18:26.320
Just kidding. Thanks a lot

18:27.040 --> 18:31.600
You being late you owe me one you're late. I know I was on the phone

18:31.600 --> 18:34.640
Whatever multiple clients this morning are like i'm like I got it

18:36.400 --> 18:39.360
Yeah, so I take the the total number of search volume

18:41.120 --> 18:44.480
And I i find like 70 75 percent of that number

18:45.600 --> 18:47.600
And then I take my top of page bid

18:48.240 --> 18:52.960
Okay, I multiply those two numbers together that gives me what the monthly budget would be

18:53.760 --> 18:59.440
And then divide that by 30 just to say average 30 days a month and that will give me a daily budget to shoot for

19:02.240 --> 19:03.520
And then I could tweak it from there

19:03.520 --> 19:08.480
Like he's gonna have a huge daily budget and monthly budget with that many people he's running ads to

19:09.040 --> 19:12.400
So I can now go well, let me just work on

19:13.680 --> 19:18.880
Decatur texas. Okay, that's gonna be this much. Let me just work on mineral wells, texas

19:18.960 --> 19:24.880
That's gonna be this much like then I can like bring my I can maybe think make things work a little bit better for me

19:25.360 --> 19:30.560
If i'm trying to like get my own clients and like, you know, get my own leads and sell them to somebody

19:31.120 --> 19:32.960
It's it helps

19:32.960 --> 19:39.120
You know that formula will help you find these smaller areas and set yourself up for success in them, too

19:39.360 --> 19:43.040
So that way you don't go i'm gonna do a window installation business outside of fort worth

19:43.520 --> 19:46.640
And you're like i'm spending like 50 a day and i'm getting nothing

19:46.960 --> 19:49.120
And when you run the numbers, it's like you should be doing

19:49.740 --> 19:55.600
290 a day and you're like, oh my god, i'm gonna go bankrupt doing that. So so that that formula is more for us

19:56.320 --> 20:01.280
But because you're because you like you're putting your own money out there first trying to get a business owner

20:01.600 --> 20:06.640
But like in your case, you're you're trying to help a you know, a friend who is a business owner

20:06.640 --> 20:08.960
so I kind of use that same formula just to like

20:09.840 --> 20:13.440
Just to even know where I need to have that conversation out because right every business owner

20:13.920 --> 20:15.920
not everybody a lot of business owners are like

20:16.800 --> 20:23.360
Especially if they haven't done digital advertising and or they've been burned or whatever it is like I just want to do this

20:23.360 --> 20:24.560
And spend five dollars

20:24.560 --> 20:29.120
Why can't you why can't you make me millions of dollars if I give you five dollars and you're like, yeah, bro

20:29.120 --> 20:30.960
It doesn't it doesn't work that way

20:30.960 --> 20:32.800
so if you use that data

20:32.800 --> 20:38.400
It just gives you a place of authority and then if there's like a conflict in the conversation you could be like here

20:38.640 --> 20:41.120
Pop on a video boom. This is what google's telling me

20:41.680 --> 20:45.120
What do you what do you i'm not lying to you? Like you can kind of have a little bit

20:45.680 --> 20:48.320
of authority and and um

20:49.120 --> 20:52.800
Just kind of like more of that expertise that like i'm using data to drive this

20:52.880 --> 20:55.280
I don't if you don't want to do it. That's cool, but

20:56.320 --> 20:58.320
I'll find the next guy that wants to make money

20:59.520 --> 21:01.200
But use the data to your advantage

21:01.200 --> 21:06.960
It gives you more confidence to demand money from a guy at a certain amount that you might feel uncomfortable with

21:07.360 --> 21:09.360
Because you're like i'm looking at data

21:09.360 --> 21:12.240
This is what this is just what it's going to cost me in advertising dollars

21:12.560 --> 21:15.200
I'm not even talking about what I want to put in my pocket, right?

21:16.080 --> 21:19.520
So at least then when you speak you speak from a better position of authority

21:20.400 --> 21:24.000
Or and you have a better expectation if this is you were doing this on your own

21:24.800 --> 21:30.640
You can be like, okay. I'm gonna burn like 75 bucks a day this and that but it looks good low-hanging fruit

21:30.720 --> 21:32.080
I'm gonna make some money

21:32.080 --> 21:35.040
Okay, i'm it looks like i'm gonna spend say two grand a month

21:35.120 --> 21:40.160
So I want to sell this deal for four thousand dollars or 35 whatever it is that you want to try to set

21:40.400 --> 21:43.360
But now at least even if you're spending more money per day

21:44.240 --> 21:49.920
You have a better expectation of like what you need to get for it to make it worth your while and that's big, too

21:50.560 --> 21:55.200
Rather than like oh, can we just do a thousand dollars a day and then you're like I lost money

21:56.160 --> 21:58.400
Right. So like by doing that you set yourself up

21:59.280 --> 22:02.400
To decide if you want to go into a niche or not or an area or not

22:02.800 --> 22:07.280
And then you also give yourself that that expertise and that authority to make a better decision

22:08.240 --> 22:13.600
And to make sure that you know what to sell it for to make money and that's probably more important than

22:14.800 --> 22:17.520
how much it's gonna cost and all that other stuff is like

22:18.080 --> 22:20.240
you know, because there's places i've gone into where i'm like

22:21.120 --> 22:26.400
Like this is gonna be expensive. But damn if I hit i'm gonna make like seven grand on this

22:27.040 --> 22:30.640
You know, like I can make some really good money or I can get into a revenue deal with the guy

22:31.600 --> 22:33.040
you know

22:33.040 --> 22:34.320
so

22:34.320 --> 22:40.480
Yeah, that's really helpful. And I think that that's the the way to go about it with the best metrics for success

22:40.560 --> 22:42.560
You know, you're planning for

22:42.720 --> 22:47.760
Success not just randomness. Yeah. Yeah, just use the data and it's new. I get it

22:47.840 --> 22:52.160
Like you're not you just that's probably your biggest issue here. It's just it's not a high budget

22:52.160 --> 22:54.320
You're running it to probably several million people

22:55.360 --> 22:58.160
and and as a niche it's not a

22:59.120 --> 23:06.640
It's not a it's not a like one and done type of service it's typically a multi-faceted multi-touch deal

23:08.240 --> 23:10.240
Okay, yeah

23:11.360 --> 23:16.480
That's helpful then I'll work on uh narrowing down the cities a little bit more and just having an honest conversation with him

23:16.960 --> 23:20.800
Yeah, my numbers and then also look at the overall budget for that too

23:21.360 --> 23:24.960
Um, and that'll give me to a good spot. Do you can I show you?

23:25.280 --> 23:29.680
Um the site that i'm driving traffic to as well so you can kind of let me know

23:30.400 --> 23:32.400
if you would add some components to it or

23:34.080 --> 23:36.080
Uh, yeah. Yeah if you want

23:37.520 --> 23:39.840
This is what it looks like right now not mobile

23:43.120 --> 23:49.040
He is an interesting window contractor I was gonna say that's cool that you have that uh-huh. Yeah, you have your types of windows

23:50.880 --> 23:54.800
We also do door upgrades but that's just not part of the ads right now

23:54.960 --> 23:56.960
And then quote from the bottom

23:57.680 --> 24:01.200
Yeah, I mean it seems like a simple landing page for people

24:02.000 --> 24:03.040
Yeah

24:03.040 --> 24:04.000
Yeah

24:04.000 --> 24:05.040
Great

24:05.040 --> 24:09.600
Well, i'll go and stop sharing my screen if um, todd wants to jump in here with his questions, but thank you jeff

24:09.600 --> 24:11.920
I appreciate your help. Yeah. No problem. Good luck

24:13.760 --> 24:15.760
Thank you. All right. Yeah

24:15.760 --> 24:20.500
Hey todd, how's it going? Good. Good. Hey, can I share my screen? Yeah, absolutely

24:21.120 --> 24:23.520
Uh, oh you again

24:25.920 --> 24:28.480
Let me see if I can find the right screen here we go

24:29.520 --> 24:31.520
all right

24:32.720 --> 24:38.800
And then todd before you get going let me because when i'm streaming sometimes things um

24:40.960 --> 24:45.200
Things don't work on the desktop. Let me just make sure no one's leaving comments on the facebook thing

24:45.280 --> 24:48.080
Just give me one quick second. I'm sorry. No worries

24:49.200 --> 24:51.200
Just it doesn't uh, yeah

24:51.360 --> 24:53.360
Yeah

24:54.240 --> 24:56.240
Let's see here

25:00.800 --> 25:07.680
All right, let's see. There he is. Okay. Yeah jason will you cover negative keywords again?

25:09.760 --> 25:12.880
Jason you covered got my own feedback

25:14.080 --> 25:15.840
um

25:15.840 --> 25:20.720
Yeah, jason, just remind me i'll do that. I'll try to cover this. Okay. Sorry todd. Go ahead

25:21.520 --> 25:23.760
No worries. So this is the uh, the site i'm

25:24.480 --> 25:27.920
Been running ads to the last month and again, this is my first the first

25:28.560 --> 25:31.600
With this group. Um, and then this was the thing that I posted

25:32.480 --> 25:34.480
um, yeah, okay, so base

25:34.480 --> 25:38.000
Basically, I think what i'm trying to find out is is volume

25:38.240 --> 25:43.440
So that's what all this is. These are just screenshots of the volume for all these different sites that I have

25:43.600 --> 25:47.600
Uh, okay. So those different sites didn't show up on that sheet. That's why I was like i'm not sure

25:47.600 --> 25:51.920
Yeah, I didn't want to I didn't want to you're fine. No, no, you're totally fine. It was just like i'm not

25:52.720 --> 25:58.160
Fully, I wasn't just what you showed was not making me fully understand what the data was. I was like, yeah

25:58.640 --> 26:02.960
No, no worries. So this one line four. This is that avondale tree service

26:03.760 --> 26:05.680
Um, that's yours

26:05.680 --> 26:08.880
This is mine. Yeah, okay. And so so what i'm i'm

26:09.360 --> 26:14.400
Again, I think I think my issue with this is I picked one of my sites that has really low

26:15.200 --> 26:17.200
Not low but lower

26:17.360 --> 26:19.600
Called volume. I mean mangos only shows 10

26:20.720 --> 26:22.720
4 000 impressions

26:23.120 --> 26:25.200
Um, and then the ad itself

26:26.640 --> 26:28.640
Looks like this

26:31.760 --> 26:33.760
And again, it's only been since

26:34.960 --> 26:41.680
What yeah, you're you're just out of that first two week thing anyway, so that's not yeah, sometimes that's part of it too

26:42.240 --> 26:45.360
Sure, the first week is always terrible

26:46.000 --> 26:52.160
Second week, it can get better third fourth week. It should keep getting better if you make the right adjustments to it. So, okay

26:52.640 --> 26:57.200
Okay, so i'm looking yeah looking at 16 clicks over the 384 impressions

26:57.280 --> 27:02.080
So basically again, i'm I should just keep it. It just needs to season more it sounds like

27:02.640 --> 27:06.640
Yeah, and like the first week it's like it could be just complete dog crap

27:06.720 --> 27:12.480
That's why we're like to talk because like the first two days is policy then after that it goes to this learning phase and

27:12.880 --> 27:17.840
It'll try to run your ads at a whole bunch of different things and it's testing it out and that's where you know

27:17.920 --> 27:19.680
you need to go in and like

27:19.680 --> 27:20.960
Maybe put things to you know

27:20.960 --> 27:25.440
Go review your search terms and go things to the negative keywords and that's you

27:26.000 --> 27:31.360
Helping google train what you want your ad to kind of focus on and then you can make improvements to headlines

27:31.440 --> 27:36.240
Whatever it is that you want to do and then that's where that second week now is like a week of that

27:36.720 --> 27:39.840
You kind of do the same thing and typically after two adjustments

27:40.560 --> 27:46.960
Most you're you're kind of pointing in that right direction and then beyond that it's just fine tuning it really

27:47.200 --> 27:51.280
Okay, um, so that's why I always say it's just the first two weeks are just kind of like

27:52.080 --> 27:56.160
I always tell business owners like hey man, the first month is not going to be awesome

27:56.240 --> 27:57.760
I'm just going to be straight with you

27:57.760 --> 28:01.360
The first two weeks are completely out of my hands because that's just google doing google

28:01.760 --> 28:06.400
um, and i'm going to do this and this and we'll start seeing things the third fourth week and

28:06.880 --> 28:09.680
That almost always works and when that almost always works

28:10.160 --> 28:14.800
I've established myself as authority and expert and then we're good. We're great sailing from there

28:15.280 --> 28:17.120
Okay, okay

28:17.120 --> 28:18.000
So then yeah

28:18.000 --> 28:23.760
And then the other question I had is is it typical that because cpc when I first started was like 490 or something

28:23.760 --> 28:25.760
It jumped up to 839

28:26.480 --> 28:34.480
Um is i'm assuming that's kind of typical right that it fluctuates or yeah, especially in trees trees will have a wild swing

28:35.120 --> 28:40.480
Yeah, and it's weird that you think like oh, it's the winter time and it gets more expensive in the winter time

28:41.520 --> 28:44.000
And then it dips and then it gets more expensive again

28:45.440 --> 28:49.600
Like late spring sometimes I think is when it gets it gets again

28:51.280 --> 28:53.280
And because right now is the time

28:53.440 --> 28:57.200
well, they pretty much should be finishing that up, but they should have been all of the

28:57.920 --> 29:03.920
Major trimming and everything else they wanted to do during the winter to set the trees up for a good spring, right?

29:04.080 --> 29:05.280
so

29:05.280 --> 29:07.600
That's why some costs go way up in the winter

29:08.640 --> 29:11.840
Yeah, because i'm i'm also I have this site over here. Um

29:13.280 --> 29:20.160
So this one's local to me would be that's the towing woodbury tree care now mango shows a volume of 80

29:20.240 --> 29:25.440
It's a little bit higher in cpc right now. And again, it's up here in minnesota. So we're just getting into

29:25.920 --> 29:27.920
Well, you guys also have trees up there

29:28.480 --> 29:33.600
Yeah a lot. In fact, yeah, it's like okay. Are you familiar with arizona like where avondale is?

29:34.000 --> 29:40.320
I grew up in uh, yeah, I started planting a church in buckeye. Yeah, okay. So yeah, i'm from tempi

29:40.640 --> 29:45.200
I'm from tempi. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So that's going to be an issue with arizona, right?

29:45.200 --> 29:47.920
It's going to be residential people with their trees and

29:48.560 --> 29:51.280
Yeah, so you're you're not going to have as many

29:52.640 --> 29:55.120
People just by the fact that they just don't have

29:56.080 --> 30:00.080
You know people don't typically have big ass shade trees out there, right?

30:00.720 --> 30:01.200
Right, yeah

30:01.200 --> 30:07.920
And so this one is like I said, it's local up here in minnesota and it's again mangles has it higher cpc is a little bit higher

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
but the volume

30:10.080 --> 30:15.680
Should last last season. I didn't have any ads joining to it. It was just you know, it's number one

30:15.840 --> 30:17.840
It's on page one of google

30:19.360 --> 30:21.360
And I had a couple of

30:21.360 --> 30:25.760
I had a couple of calls coming in monthly never was able to lock anybody down

30:26.560 --> 30:29.200
So considering doing this for the season

30:29.920 --> 30:35.280
Running some ads to get this one boosted. I have two business owners that said talk to me next year

30:36.080 --> 30:42.240
Yeah for that for that site. So so so that page one rank that those are your sites ranking on page one

30:42.880 --> 30:44.720
Yeah, yeah, like

30:44.720 --> 30:46.000
Yep

30:46.000 --> 30:51.520
Like all my towing sites are in the map pack and those are all sold already. So that's great. Good job, man

30:52.080 --> 30:54.080
Yeah, I would say then like

30:54.720 --> 30:56.720
One oh good the what go ahead

30:57.120 --> 31:00.000
I was gonna say like for that avondale one like I would just really

31:00.720 --> 31:04.960
If it's really that low search volume and you're on page one and you're ranking for big terms

31:04.960 --> 31:09.440
Like I just keep going for the organic play there and I wouldn't waste my money

31:10.080 --> 31:16.400
Personally, if i'm ranking one on like multiple keywords or in the map pack for things that to me would just be like

31:17.120 --> 31:21.520
Well, i'm my stuff's already there. Why do I need to keep paying for it? Right?

31:22.480 --> 31:28.160
Yes, this is me right here. Yeah, I would just maybe try to work on getting some more reviews to it

31:28.800 --> 31:31.520
Yeah, but look at number three same thing

31:32.080 --> 31:34.480
um, so I yeah, I would I I think you're

31:35.680 --> 31:39.280
Yeah, that's what I that would that's why I would put my time and money into it

31:39.280 --> 31:43.040
just to try to rank it for other keywords in the area and

31:44.320 --> 31:46.480
Just it's either gonna get clicks or not

31:47.360 --> 31:51.200
Yeah, so maybe that low search volume it's just gonna save you money

31:51.920 --> 31:58.800
Yeah, that's that's where i'm at right now. So i'm i'm really leaning toward really kicking into that tree this this tree care

31:59.600 --> 32:00.400
one

32:00.400 --> 32:02.400
because that's that's uh

32:03.440 --> 32:05.440
um

32:06.560 --> 32:08.560
Hold on

32:08.640 --> 32:10.640
I

32:12.880 --> 32:19.120
Think i'm in map pack there too. Yeah, that's right here number one and organic. It's awesome. Yeah. Yeah

32:21.040 --> 32:24.480
Yeah, you're not quite in the map pack there but you're number one that's pretty good

32:24.960 --> 32:28.800
Yeah, pretty much all all my tree care ones are my towing for sure

32:28.880 --> 32:30.960
They jump really quick into map pack

32:30.960 --> 32:36.080
But yeah, so I would just like just try to get those things to rank in some more keywords

32:36.560 --> 32:38.560
Try to get that gmb up

32:38.560 --> 32:41.360
And I make for the one that has a search volume of 80

32:41.360 --> 32:46.080
That's one where if I know i'm doing really well organically and I can get the map pack up

32:46.720 --> 32:52.640
Maybe what I do is just be really selectful with what keywords I want to run my ad to maybe not be as broad

32:53.280 --> 32:56.960
And maybe be a little more specific even including exact match keywords

32:57.680 --> 33:03.360
And that way i'm really and and what I could be doing then is like buying more real estate on page one

33:03.920 --> 33:10.080
So you'll see my ad you'll see my site or you'll see my google business profile and you're going to see my like

33:10.480 --> 33:12.720
I just own three spots of what 12?

33:13.440 --> 33:17.600
Yeah, 13 maybe depending on how they're displaying it. It's pretty damn good odds

33:18.080 --> 33:22.560
That you'll get some clicks that way. So that's something that you can supplement really good seo with

33:23.120 --> 33:25.120
Especially if you know there's value to it

33:25.920 --> 33:26.800
Okay, yeah

33:26.800 --> 33:33.280
Yeah, and that and that will help reduce your overall ad spend and make it work in a in a better way

33:33.360 --> 33:34.400
for you

33:34.400 --> 33:37.680
Right. Okay. So just just to recap probably

33:38.880 --> 33:40.560
um

33:40.560 --> 33:46.400
Folk get more reviews on the avondale tree service and then the other tree service one run a couple of ads

33:47.120 --> 33:48.640
keyword specific

33:48.640 --> 33:49.920
Mm-hmm

33:49.920 --> 33:54.080
I think and I also i'm trying to get break into the concrete world, but uh,

33:54.720 --> 33:57.360
I got to do more due diligence on that. So, okay

33:58.160 --> 34:02.960
Yeah, yeah, thanks. Yeah. Yeah, no problem. Uh, yeah keep it out. You're doing great on the seo stuff

34:02.960 --> 34:07.840
That's that's the long-term play right? Yep. So yeah, I think that's the long-term play

34:07.840 --> 34:12.320
The ads thing is great to get it going fast and also to like when things are slow

34:12.320 --> 34:15.440
You can supplement with ads and like again, it can just get you

34:16.000 --> 34:21.200
You know like a nick talks about in the sales about you know, it's like just it's about monopoly, right?

34:21.280 --> 34:25.680
The best way to the best chances of winning the game and monopoly is owning the most properties on the board

34:26.160 --> 34:28.000
And yeah, that's exactly what I was just saying

34:28.160 --> 34:34.000
You just you can really be specific about certain jobs that you want certain types of services that you want

34:34.480 --> 34:37.440
You can run them on top of where you're already ranking number one for

34:38.000 --> 34:42.480
Um, but you can use the ads and you can be very specific on the keywords that you select

34:43.200 --> 34:47.040
Including just doing exact match and you're you could just be like

34:47.760 --> 34:51.680
Okay, i'm not doing really good on like say commercial tree services and I want to do that

34:51.920 --> 34:55.120
So i'm going to run ads just there and maybe i'll get a job here and there from it

34:55.680 --> 34:56.480
Cool, yeah

34:56.480 --> 34:58.480
Uh, or I want to boost tree removal

34:58.960 --> 35:04.000
And so i'm going to run an ad for that for this month and let it sit on top of my organic rankings

35:04.320 --> 35:08.480
And now I got three freaking shots at getting someone to click on my stuff

35:09.360 --> 35:11.360
Yeah, that's pretty that's pretty dang cool

35:11.840 --> 35:12.800
Okay

35:12.800 --> 35:15.120
Thanks, man. Yeah, no problem. Great job

35:16.640 --> 35:20.480
Uh, I think I saw Janelle next I see your hand up

35:20.880 --> 35:22.880
Hi jack, hi, how you doing?

35:23.680 --> 35:24.880
We're back

35:24.880 --> 35:26.880
You're back. Yeah

35:27.680 --> 35:32.880
Um, well, thanks. It's good to be on here again and I will try my best to keep it concise. Um

35:33.680 --> 35:38.640
We uh have that it's a similar the same business owner. We were talking about before

35:38.640 --> 35:43.520
So just to recap we had new work tree service three. We have california, right?

35:43.520 --> 35:47.760
So because we already picked that um, and we have a paying business owner and he's working with us and all that

35:47.760 --> 35:53.280
Working with us and all that. Um, but we got a much bigger budget this time from him is willing to pay more

35:53.920 --> 35:55.040
um

35:55.040 --> 36:02.800
We're not running ads on new work tree service. We created two other websites for him danville and castro valley location, which are near us

36:03.120 --> 36:07.040
New work's the only one we've been able to get a gbp on or gmb on

36:07.440 --> 36:09.840
Um having a lot of trouble with gmb's lately

36:09.840 --> 36:16.960
I don't know if everyone else is experiencing this in the last three months, but it's been auto suspensions appeal denials like everything

36:17.600 --> 36:18.720
um

36:18.720 --> 36:20.720
So just haven't gotten one to go through in a while

36:21.440 --> 36:22.800
um

36:22.800 --> 36:29.040
So we are now running an ad to castro valley tree service to that site for him. It's one of the newer sites

36:29.520 --> 36:31.600
um, and

36:31.600 --> 36:37.520
I just have some questions about the campaign and i thought I was just saying like i'd love to see your um

36:37.760 --> 36:41.760
Some of your keywords if you wouldn't mind sharing because the click through it. It's brand new

36:41.760 --> 36:45.440
We just launched a week and a half ago and I know it takes a couple weeks

36:45.520 --> 36:49.280
But um, can I share with you and show you my screen on what we're seeing?

36:50.240 --> 36:51.360
Absolutely

36:51.360 --> 36:51.920
All right

36:51.920 --> 36:57.200
And then the other thing is I get a little lost because I I think I created too many mcc's and so it's

36:57.680 --> 37:01.600
Kind of having a hard time figuring out which is which so i'm sure I did it wrong

37:03.360 --> 37:08.160
And then it's telling me that one of my accounts needs to be verified, but I don't think it's the one that's running

37:08.640 --> 37:10.640
Um this this ad

37:11.200 --> 37:13.600
Um, it's got a different account number

37:14.400 --> 37:18.960
Okay, so let me see if I can find it really quick so castro valley tree service

37:19.680 --> 37:22.640
Gosh, sorry. It's gonna just do this whole thing. Um

37:24.720 --> 37:26.560
And then we got like

37:26.560 --> 37:31.520
It stopped running our ad two days ago and it said something like we we had reached the max

37:32.400 --> 37:36.160
Threshold or something and it only charged us 18 dollars and 20 cents

37:36.800 --> 37:39.440
Um, and I was having a hard time finding where to do the payment

37:40.000 --> 37:45.120
Um, and we've set our max budget to fifty six dollars and sixty six fifty six sixty six a day

37:45.680 --> 37:50.400
Um, and I was kind of in line with what google was recommending. It wasn't the high end and it wasn't the low end

37:50.480 --> 37:52.080
It was like right there

37:52.080 --> 37:53.920
um

37:53.920 --> 37:56.400
So it's telling you that it was like limited by budget

37:57.600 --> 38:00.800
It said something about my threshold had been exceeded

38:00.800 --> 38:07.120
So I put through a ten dollar payment or 18 20 18 20 and it looks like it's back up, but it wasn't

38:08.080 --> 38:15.360
Right, like i'm still let's see. Hold on. You might have put a cap on it. Maybe like some people put like a monthly budget on it

38:16.080 --> 38:20.880
Okay, if I did I didn't know that I was setting that up and yeah, I mean may not have I just

38:21.600 --> 38:27.280
Yeah, what you're saying i'm trying to I can't remember last time I even saw something like that. So like it's not

38:27.840 --> 38:30.640
Yeah, it was a weird thing at the top and I was like, what is this name?

38:31.280 --> 38:35.920
Uh, it wasn't a big balance. So it looked like so that was the day like shut off. We got nothing

38:36.560 --> 38:37.680
and then

38:37.680 --> 38:40.080
Um, it's picking back up and let's see you started

38:40.960 --> 38:45.360
You started it that could have just been a click, uh, a glitch in the matrix, too

38:45.600 --> 38:51.360
I've had like i've woken up to like alerts that like this got suspended and that and I go on and i'm like

38:51.680 --> 38:57.360
It's all there. I don't know what the heck that was like i've had weird like I just call them glitches in the matrix sometimes

38:58.000 --> 38:58.880
Okay

38:58.880 --> 39:02.880
Um, so we have gotten one call yesterday for this ad

39:03.040 --> 39:07.680
But obviously not expecting to see much and it does look like I didn't see it today, but it looks like it's picked up

39:08.240 --> 39:12.400
Um yesterday, so we got 14 clicks. I'm not using a lot of keywords. Um

39:13.120 --> 39:16.400
I tried doing some negative keywords our score on optimization

39:16.400 --> 39:20.000
I tried doing some of your old stuff that I saw like where you could say skip and skip

39:20.480 --> 39:24.000
Doesn't let you do that anymore. Like it actually wants me to do this stuff

39:24.560 --> 39:29.200
Really? Yeah, it wants me to do callouts. It wants me to do that. I do that all the time

39:29.600 --> 39:31.840
It sends them back to you, but I just get rid of them

39:32.400 --> 39:35.840
So it wants me to do conversion tracking dads. Nope. Do not do that

39:36.240 --> 39:41.280
I know you guys will you just hit dismiss just tell it to piss off. They'll cut it. They'll

39:41.760 --> 39:43.760
They're always going to try to make money from you. Just hit this

39:44.720 --> 39:50.480
Just hit it. Yep. Bye. Okay back. They'll bring it back in a week. Big deal. Bye. Okay. I didn't see the dismiss. Thank you

39:51.680 --> 39:56.640
And then should I be doing site links on ads? Do you recommend those? Yeah, it helps add some more

39:57.120 --> 40:01.680
Um real estate to the ad if you have a full page if you have a one pager, no

40:02.480 --> 40:06.320
Yeah, we have a one pager. Yeah, yeah, then you're not going to be able to do it. So don't do it

40:06.800 --> 40:12.000
Okay, and that was a question that I had about the ad we're just doing one campaign one ad group

40:12.720 --> 40:19.760
But it's tree service. So I was wondering do you think we should do an ad group for tree removal an ad group for tree trimming an ad

40:19.760 --> 40:23.040
Group for like the different keywords or just keep them all in one

40:23.600 --> 40:26.480
Um, what's what's the population you're running this to?

40:30.800 --> 40:33.120
140 oh, let's see castro valley. I can't

40:37.500 --> 40:39.040
65 000

40:39.040 --> 40:42.960
Okay, are you running a radius or just a casserole just castro valley right now?

40:43.040 --> 40:46.320
But we got a call from union city yesterday, which is a neighboring city

40:47.120 --> 40:49.120
okay, so

40:50.160 --> 40:52.160
And this is right along the bay, right?

40:52.720 --> 40:55.840
Yeah, we're in the bay area. Um, it's near oakland

40:56.880 --> 41:01.760
Yeah, but uh, let's see. So there's like union city and castro valley

41:02.560 --> 41:06.160
San lorenzo san liandro some of those other areas

41:07.040 --> 41:09.840
Uh, wait, oh, that's actually oakland castro

41:10.480 --> 41:16.320
No, it's next to oakland. It's next to oakland. Okay. Yeah, I think my sister used to live. Oh, yeah

41:16.400 --> 41:18.960
No, no, my sister lived just north of that. Sorry. Okay. Yeah

41:23.120 --> 41:25.440
Okay, so I would okay so

41:26.400 --> 41:30.880
65 000 people that's fine. I I don't think you need to run different ad groups

41:31.600 --> 41:33.600
If you're in a more populated area, yes

41:34.240 --> 41:36.660
That's part of the reason why we say don't do california

41:37.680 --> 41:39.680
Because you have to set up more of an expert ad

41:40.160 --> 41:41.120
Yeah

41:41.120 --> 41:42.080
Okay

41:42.080 --> 41:46.640
Does the optimization optimization score do anything for your ad or is it just

41:47.600 --> 41:51.840
It doesn't always have to stay at 100 but yeah the higher it is the better it is just

41:52.240 --> 41:55.840
If you go like if you go to the left and hit recommendations, that's going to tell you

41:56.480 --> 41:59.040
All the stuff they recommend at the top left dish

41:59.520 --> 42:05.120
Okay, hold on top left column. Yeah, you'll see or it says overview recommendations and site reports. Yep

42:05.920 --> 42:10.240
Yeah, it was like call outs and site links and yeah, so I think it's important

42:10.240 --> 42:14.240
so call outs what they're trying to get you to do with not call outs but like

42:14.720 --> 42:18.480
Setting the conversions like people that go to like ctas and all that

42:19.040 --> 42:23.360
That is a guarantee. They are going to spend all of your money every day

42:23.920 --> 42:27.680
They're going to do it. You if you want to do that, that's great. But like

42:28.240 --> 42:30.960
Even if I set an ad up for seventy five dollars a day

42:31.840 --> 42:36.400
um, I typically don't run seventy five dollars a day unless i've like

42:36.960 --> 42:41.600
Massively misjudged it but if I do if I set it up to do the conversion

42:42.160 --> 42:44.880
It it'll always run my seventy five dollars a day

42:45.360 --> 42:48.640
So that's kind of I don't really recommend doing it for what we're doing

42:49.120 --> 42:55.120
Yeah, so yeah, you can just go here. You can just dismiss it hit the three dots hit dismiss watch your ad score go up

42:55.520 --> 42:57.520
Okay, cool. Um

42:58.400 --> 43:02.160
Like any of the recommendations, yeah, i'll just say oh I can just do dismiss all

43:04.640 --> 43:06.160
I'll do it later

43:06.160 --> 43:10.000
Yeah, okay. It's going up. Okay. I'll play with that later. I'll just just dismiss everything

43:10.480 --> 43:14.800
Um, do we want just to save you a step you see the three dots next to the 4.3?

43:16.160 --> 43:22.480
Yeah, click that just dismiss all and then hit dismiss. There you go. One less click for you to do. Okay. Okay

43:23.200 --> 43:25.840
Um now any of these recommendations that we should actually do

43:28.160 --> 43:30.160
Um, no, okay

43:30.880 --> 43:31.360
All right

43:31.360 --> 43:32.240
and then

43:32.240 --> 43:36.640
Can I just especially not if you don't have like a if you just want to if you're running to one page or no

43:36.800 --> 43:39.040
When you start getting to adding a full website

43:39.760 --> 43:42.320
adding site links and call outs can be

43:43.360 --> 43:47.840
Helpful in the fact that your ad might take up more real estate on certain displays

43:48.320 --> 43:54.480
And if they give you more real estate to display your ad that typically means one more person's ad isn't going to show

43:55.760 --> 43:59.520
So there's a tactical advantage to it. Is it necessary? Absolutely not

43:59.920 --> 44:04.080
If you want to go through the hassle of it, you're more than welcome to it's not a negative thing

44:04.080 --> 44:08.640
but you don't do it with a one pager because you don't have the urls for it, but um,

44:09.680 --> 44:14.260
It's more of a real estate game than it is about like getting more conversions

44:14.800 --> 44:19.520
Yeah, and we'd probably have to create different landing pages for each keyword and we have them all on one right now. So

44:20.160 --> 44:21.440
just simpler

44:21.440 --> 44:23.760
um, we don't have a ton of

44:24.300 --> 44:27.200
keywords, but I just put some of the top ones and I've

44:27.840 --> 44:29.440
um

44:29.440 --> 44:33.040
This is not the keywords I picked. I don't know. I had like only seven

44:33.920 --> 44:35.440
and then

44:35.520 --> 44:39.040
Overview will show me what people are searching right if I look down here

44:40.640 --> 44:42.640
Top searches

44:42.800 --> 44:43.680
um

44:43.680 --> 44:45.680
And then keywords

44:46.160 --> 44:47.680
So I did

44:47.680 --> 44:52.080
I I haven't done the negative keywords in a while, but I did put how to diy

44:52.880 --> 44:58.480
Free all that stuff some of the brand name tree services are like, you know the big business

44:59.040 --> 45:03.440
Yeah, can you leave this here for a second? I'm gonna i'm gonna scroll on a second tangent

45:03.840 --> 45:06.080
So for jason who asked this question earlier

45:06.800 --> 45:12.320
When we're looking right here, you can see in the negative keyword list. You can see how some of them are exact match

45:12.960 --> 45:14.960
Some of them are broad match. Um

45:15.600 --> 45:18.880
I if I remember correctly, there's no phrase match. Um

45:19.760 --> 45:21.760
Negative keywords nor do you want that?

45:21.760 --> 45:28.080
And the difference is that when you go to your search terms and you see a search term like anr tree service anvil tree service

45:28.480 --> 45:31.520
And you select it and you say send to the negative keyword list

45:31.920 --> 45:35.040
That's that term goes over as an exact match

45:35.600 --> 45:40.080
Versus here where she typed in diy do it yourself

45:40.640 --> 45:42.640
For free how to

45:42.960 --> 45:48.960
Those things will go in it. You can select broad match or exact match. So hopefully that answers your question jason. Okay

45:49.520 --> 45:51.040
Sorry, thank you

45:51.040 --> 45:54.320
While you're here, I just thought I didn't want to ignore his comment. So of course

45:54.800 --> 46:00.400
Yeah, everyone has like a lot of the same questions and stuff. So yeah, okay, so that's good

46:00.400 --> 46:03.600
So you've you've gone through your search terms. That's great. That's what you need to do

46:04.160 --> 46:05.760
um

46:05.760 --> 46:07.760
Yeah, I I do wonder

46:09.520 --> 46:12.640
If um, let's see you have you see it's

46:14.080 --> 46:16.080
Saying not eligible my campaign is paused

46:17.280 --> 46:18.400
Uh-huh

46:18.400 --> 46:20.400
okay, so okay where it says

46:21.280 --> 46:26.400
Sorry where it says like uh add callouts to your account all that like get rid of that

46:26.960 --> 46:32.640
That window or whatever you want to call it there, yeah, okay, so you're looking at all campaigns right now

46:32.640 --> 46:36.960
So you had two campaigns you had one that's paused one. That's not okay

46:37.040 --> 46:41.280
So if we want to yeah, that's all if you want to go to the one that's running just just uh, no

46:42.000 --> 46:44.000
Don't do that. I don't want that one

46:44.400 --> 46:46.400
It's fine. It's not doing anything. Just leave it there

46:46.720 --> 46:51.360
I i'm not a big fan of deleting stuff on google ads. So just leave it just hit pause

46:51.600 --> 46:55.760
It just stays so now what we want to do is we want to look at go back to your campaigns

46:56.320 --> 47:01.120
Sorry, I didn't mean to freak you out. Okay. So yeah now just click the one that's open click that just click it

47:01.680 --> 47:05.120
Now that'll take you to the next one. Now you can look at now look at the top

47:05.440 --> 47:11.360
Keeps bringing that that damn window for you. Um, now you can see okay. So now notice how now you have that campaign

47:12.240 --> 47:16.800
Yeah, okay. So now you can even you can select an ad group if you had multiple ad groups

47:17.360 --> 47:19.760
Which which is fine. Now you can look at keywords

47:20.160 --> 47:22.160
Uh, no problem. Todd. We'll see you later

47:22.720 --> 47:27.760
Right here. You can look. Uh, yes, and now that should be under this ad group. See how

47:28.320 --> 47:31.680
Yeah, see you at the top. Yeah. Okay. Now you shouldn't see that

47:32.480 --> 47:33.520
that

47:33.520 --> 47:37.120
Okay, is that helpful sometimes when you see stuff? That's weird

47:37.440 --> 47:42.480
What I like to do is I look at the top where it says search keywords and it has that like that's that's

47:43.280 --> 47:48.640
Like right there. See how you go above that. See how it says you all campaigns what campaign and what ad group?

47:49.600 --> 47:53.840
Yeah, so if I if i'm ever looking at my I call it the spreadsheet section and i'm like

47:54.400 --> 47:58.160
This doesn't make sense to me. I typically go up and go. Oh, I forgot to select that

47:58.640 --> 48:02.560
Um, and the other place you can get in trouble is on like the top of the spreadsheet

48:03.040 --> 48:06.960
Where the plus sign is and I call it the little martini glass you have the filters

48:07.440 --> 48:11.600
Sometimes people don't realize they added a filter to it if you go down go down

48:12.160 --> 48:16.320
Go down go down right right right there. See I have the little martini

48:16.480 --> 48:21.200
So sometimes people do a filter and they forget and they're like I can't find this and this isn't looking and I go

48:21.520 --> 48:26.240
Well, your filters are turned on so you have to turn those off and then the other common one is the date range

48:26.960 --> 48:31.280
So just fyi, so if you ever find yourself or you're like what i'm looking at doesn't make sense

48:31.920 --> 48:35.360
um, that's just a just an fyi for you just uh

48:36.160 --> 48:40.880
Just check those things and typically that you'll be able to sort out what you're not seeing

48:41.600 --> 48:44.560
Yeah, it typically like for some reason it always goes back to the last date

48:44.560 --> 48:47.680
I looked at and then i'm like wait, why am I not? Oh, it's not current. So

48:48.480 --> 48:54.240
Yeah, that's fine. You're good. Okay, so we got our keywords here. Okay, so here's something that's interesting

48:54.240 --> 48:56.240
So you have a lot of impressions?

48:56.800 --> 49:00.880
And a lot of clicks at really really really cheap cpc

49:01.520 --> 49:05.600
My gut is that you have display network on and search partners on

49:06.400 --> 49:09.280
I turned it off. But can we look maybe where I go for that?

49:09.760 --> 49:11.760
Uh should be in your settings

49:12.080 --> 49:14.080
For your campaign campaign settings

49:15.440 --> 49:17.680
Sorry, tell me where to go just go to campaigns

49:20.240 --> 49:23.040
You're gonna go to the settings just hover over it

49:24.560 --> 49:27.440
Hover over the yep. See the little yep. Okay

49:29.680 --> 49:36.080
I'm having a hard time finding places. I get lost. Okay. Yeah right there networks google search network search partners display an hour

49:36.320 --> 49:41.440
Shoot, I thought it's okay. It's super easy to super easy to miss. So go ahead save

49:41.600 --> 49:43.600
I did it on that other campaign

49:43.680 --> 49:49.440
That was the other castor valley and then I couldn't find it when I went to create it the draft. So that's why I did this other one

49:49.680 --> 49:50.800
Yeah

49:50.800 --> 49:52.800
Okay, so that's gonna help

49:53.360 --> 49:55.680
That's that could be your number one issue right now

49:56.160 --> 50:00.240
Okay. Yeah, we had a really it was saying the cpc was really low

50:00.720 --> 50:06.480
Yeah, that's that's because you're yeah, and that's because you're running display ads and search partner ads

50:07.200 --> 50:09.200
Uh, okay

50:09.200 --> 50:15.280
And then audiences we just did castor valley now that you know, it's 63,000 and our budget is 56 a day

50:15.600 --> 50:21.840
We try doing your calculation the 75 percent time, you know all that. Yeah for the main keywords. Um

50:22.640 --> 50:26.800
But we're just not getting a lot of data in castor valley or even big cities near us

50:26.880 --> 50:28.880
Like a lot of stuff is there's no cpc

50:29.760 --> 50:32.640
Uh for our keywords, so we did the best we could

50:32.640 --> 50:34.640
So

50:34.880 --> 50:38.640
Okay, yeah, no, I think you're so I think that's your biggest issue was that

50:39.600 --> 50:42.720
Okay, it's just that it's not firing where you want it to fire

50:43.520 --> 50:46.800
All right. So now that'll be changed so that that should help you out

50:47.520 --> 50:51.920
A lot and todd is off. But I mean these are all I have for keywords

50:53.840 --> 50:56.320
Yeah, if that's what you saw in the data then that's what you use

50:57.120 --> 50:58.000
Okay

50:58.000 --> 51:04.480
But I think right now it's just like you got 230 impressions like I doubt that many I doubt that's your monthly search volume at all

51:05.360 --> 51:07.360
Yeah, it's like 10

51:07.440 --> 51:09.440
on each word

51:09.520 --> 51:14.080
so you're not going to get a lot of you're not going to get a lot of action in that city, but

51:15.200 --> 51:20.720
You'll get action which is good and it's california. So you don't want to get into competitive areas

51:20.720 --> 51:23.680
So just hang tight where you're at and now that you made that

51:23.680 --> 51:28.960
I think that was the biggest factor was you're just accidentally left the display network and search partners on

51:29.520 --> 51:33.120
Okay, and then that's why your clicks are probably crappy and you're like, I don't get it

51:33.200 --> 51:39.280
I'm getting clicks, but no one's calling or they're they're just clicking display ads and stuff and those are typically robots at night

51:39.920 --> 51:41.920
Okay, and then um

51:42.400 --> 51:47.760
Do you think we were going to try and put a logo on the ad but it makes me do advertiser verification

51:47.840 --> 51:49.840
How hard is that?

51:50.640 --> 51:54.560
The advertiser verification process well if it forces you there's a well

51:55.120 --> 51:57.440
Them trying to get a logo out of you is different than

51:58.160 --> 52:01.520
Them forcing you to do advertiser verification. So I just dismiss it

52:02.240 --> 52:05.440
If you but if you make up a logo for him, you can put a logo in there

52:05.920 --> 52:07.280
I mean we have one

52:07.280 --> 52:12.720
But I I didn't want to have to do the whole advertiser verification because it was asking me stuff and I was like

52:13.520 --> 52:15.840
It says are you running this for your your reason?

52:16.800 --> 52:21.760
Yeah, that's you that's getting you verified which is fine you're gonna have you'll have to go through that at some point

52:22.160 --> 52:24.400
But let it tell you you have to do it by this date

52:25.120 --> 52:27.440
Okay, like I have on the other on the other one

52:28.240 --> 52:31.920
When you do that, do you say you're working as an agency or you are the business?

52:33.600 --> 52:36.640
Um, i'm the agency so I always use it as like i'm an agency

52:37.120 --> 52:42.400
Okay, yeah rather than the business because then it's like now you have to get paperwork from the business

52:42.880 --> 52:48.800
Do all that stuff and that could get weird it's easier to say yeah, I run my I run a small digital marketing agency

52:49.600 --> 52:53.600
Yeah, okay. Got it. And then last question for you is

52:54.480 --> 52:59.280
Should we be so he has the business owner has his own website

52:59.760 --> 53:06.880
His website is you know been around a while. It's not getting any it's not doing great in the rank and rent industry

53:07.360 --> 53:12.400
But we're wondering if it would be better to run some run the ad to his website

53:12.800 --> 53:16.560
It's been around a lot longer and create a landing page off of this

53:18.160 --> 53:22.240
As opposed to running him to castro valley our our rank and rent site

53:22.960 --> 53:25.760
Or our landing page that's on our rank and rent site, but hidden

53:26.640 --> 53:28.640
That makes sense

53:28.880 --> 53:30.880
um

53:31.760 --> 53:33.120
I mean

53:33.120 --> 53:35.360
Because we don't have a gmb yet on castor valley

53:36.080 --> 53:39.040
Where is our landing page? Yeah, but that's that's gonna just be

53:40.560 --> 53:43.680
That that's an seo thing. That's not really

53:44.400 --> 53:49.760
An ad worry. Yeah, not really an ad worry about it. But yeah, I I wouldn't um

53:53.520 --> 53:57.600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can do either one but I mean I would keep my own assets

53:58.240 --> 54:05.120
Okay, so run it to ours if we're running the ad to a landing page. Well, never mind. Just hang on. Um

54:05.360 --> 54:11.200
We have a we have two tracking numbers. We have the you know, the organic going to our website and then we have the landing page

54:11.840 --> 54:15.920
Um for the ad that has a different phone number. So we're tracking like what's coming from what?

54:18.080 --> 54:20.080
And then yeah, okay

54:20.880 --> 54:26.240
Because we'd have to build a landing page off of his page with a different phone number because this is actually going to him

54:26.880 --> 54:28.880
Yes, he won't be okay

54:28.880 --> 54:34.240
Um, hey matt if you're listening any other questions i'm just asking my husband. Is that it pretty good?

54:36.000 --> 54:38.000
Okay, maybe he's not on uh

54:39.200 --> 54:45.040
Okay, cool. So just try that for a while and maybe expand to a few more cities if we're not getting a lot

54:45.520 --> 54:47.520
Yeah, be careful with that area

54:48.080 --> 54:54.080
Yeah expensive just make sure before you even expand it. I would run every little city every zip code has its own

54:54.640 --> 54:57.040
Due diligence just so you know what you're getting into

54:57.660 --> 55:01.040
56 a day is really not a lot in california for

55:01.760 --> 55:02.960
ads, you know

55:02.960 --> 55:06.000
So, you know just just take that for whatever it's worth it

55:06.480 --> 55:10.320
At the end of the day, there's not a lot of search volume in the city that you're finding which is fine

55:10.960 --> 55:11.840
um

55:11.840 --> 55:17.920
But the the other factor is that your ads weren't running to google search ads. They were running to other places

55:18.720 --> 55:23.840
So it's kind of giving you a false sense of what's going on. So great. Okay. Yeah

55:25.280 --> 55:30.800
Yeah, and oh now we're getting to the page bit. You're in united. No, you're in the united states. Okay. There we go

55:31.520 --> 55:33.920
Yeah, so because I was just there was blank data

55:34.000 --> 55:38.560
So when we tried to figure out what's an appropriate budget we just we could only do it for a couple few words

55:38.640 --> 55:45.920
So we just assumed it was going to be that much for the other that's saying it's 140 000 people that that ads running to

55:46.000 --> 55:47.520
Which is fine

55:47.520 --> 55:48.960
Yeah to reach

55:48.960 --> 55:51.840
Yeah, see we have nothing to go for for those common

55:53.440 --> 55:57.520
Are you seeing ads like when you look there are you seeing people run ads in cash?

55:58.320 --> 56:00.320
Yeah, okay

56:01.760 --> 56:03.760
Yeah, there's tree trimming right there I saw

56:04.480 --> 56:09.620
So yeah, I found like a couple so I went with this as the high of what 1469

56:10.960 --> 56:15.040
And I think I just kind of did however many keywords six and I just was like, all right

56:15.040 --> 56:17.840
Let's consider they're all around that amount and make sure

56:18.880 --> 56:25.680
Was close. No, that's fine. And your search volume's so low that I wouldn't be worried about it. You can see fluctuations in the search volume

56:26.560 --> 56:28.000
um

56:28.000 --> 56:30.640
So yeah, i'm not that familiar with that city

56:30.720 --> 56:33.120
So it could just be that maybe there's just not a lot of trees there

56:33.120 --> 56:35.440
But I kind of think that area has a lot of trees, right?

56:36.080 --> 56:40.960
There's a lot and the crazy thing is when I do it impressions is above three thousands

56:41.660 --> 56:43.660
3000 but it's saying 10

56:45.280 --> 56:48.080
That's search volume but your impressions we're going to

56:49.280 --> 56:52.960
Display ads and search networks. That's that's a whole other beast. You just

56:53.680 --> 56:59.360
They will span the shit out of the web the internet on with your stuff like you had stuff running ads on

57:01.200 --> 57:03.200
Um, like on people's games

57:03.520 --> 57:08.240
You know, they could run like a free game and it shows you an ad you had you your ads were showing there

57:09.200 --> 57:11.200
to like take a kid playing like

57:11.920 --> 57:16.560
Block blast or some I don't know gold digger game out whatever the hell the kids are playing

57:16.560 --> 57:21.840
But like that's what your ads are running to in that area when you have display network and other stuff on

57:22.320 --> 57:28.080
So that would affect what we saw in the forecast because we were under that campaign when we were searching in keyword planner

57:29.600 --> 57:33.040
Oh, that's why in the budget was showing such a low cpc

57:35.440 --> 57:42.100
And a high impression, oh, okay interesting we're like, why are these impressions so high it should only be like 1500

57:43.200 --> 57:47.840
Let's see. It's you know, it's united states. Okay. All right united states again. Yep

57:51.840 --> 57:54.480
Seven point two thousand that makes no sense

57:55.200 --> 58:00.560
Because newark, which is a bigger city used to be like around fifteen to two thousand

58:03.120 --> 58:05.120
So, I don't know that's funky

58:05.760 --> 58:11.120
Uh forecasting Brian. Oh, okay. No, that's fine. Uh, no you bring that back what you're doing

58:11.120 --> 58:16.320
I know go back to where you were. I'll I'll show you something that's let's try to look at something differently there

58:16.320 --> 58:22.480
All right, so see where it says match type for a keyword it says all keywords maximize clicks and then

58:23.280 --> 58:25.600
Match type. Okay. Now change that

58:26.320 --> 58:28.320
now do phrase

58:28.800 --> 58:30.320
Now hit apply

58:30.320 --> 58:32.320
Let's see if that changes

58:33.280 --> 58:35.280
Okay, so let's see if that changes

58:36.320 --> 58:38.320
Okay, so let's see if that changes

58:38.320 --> 58:41.200
Okay, now change that now do phrase

58:42.880 --> 58:45.360
Now hit apply let's see if that changes

58:47.360 --> 58:50.720
Went down a bit and look at what the what's the average daily budget

58:51.920 --> 58:58.480
56 66 and what does that say it is 57. Yes, that's 57, which is what you have. So you're you're right there

59:00.720 --> 59:02.720
Okay, it's just a lot of impressions

59:03.280 --> 59:05.840
More than I expect to see for those this city

59:06.800 --> 59:07.920
Yes

59:07.920 --> 59:11.200
Yeah, but this is where like, you know in the past people, you know

59:11.200 --> 59:16.640
Well, you know simrush shows this mangle shows that keyword planner shows this, you know

59:16.640 --> 59:20.400
rare is really good because rare brings up rare will bring up your

59:21.280 --> 59:26.560
Like google keyword data, right or google keyword planner data. So it's been really good to use

59:28.160 --> 59:33.280
Yeah, but like that's why I tell people like you can even see mistakes inside google planner where like

59:33.840 --> 59:38.320
One thing says something totally different than the other thing. So like none of this is perfect

59:39.040 --> 59:42.560
Right. We just whatever data we have we just try to make the best decisions on it

59:42.960 --> 59:46.720
But even here you can see that there's just weird differences with them

59:47.360 --> 59:52.240
Yeah, just a lot higher than we used to see for even newark, but maybe the season two and the time frame

59:52.240 --> 59:54.240
It's looking out for the forecast

59:54.560 --> 59:57.040
Yeah, it knows it's going to get busier right now

59:57.360 --> 59:59.360
Yeah spring

59:59.520 --> 01:00:03.840
Yep. Yeah. Yep. Okay. All right cool. And then I see a more accurate cpc

01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:10.560
17 15 13 dollars. It was low. It was like a dollar and we're like, yes, this is amazing

01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:14.320
Yeah, no, that was just brought and that's because of the broad match thing

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:19.760
Oh, okay. Never like watch if you like now do exact match watch it drop even more

01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:21.760
Yeah

01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:25.280
See that

01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:27.280
Okay, okay. All right

01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:32.000
Okay, i've never even seen this is this the new feature or this has always been there. It's always been there

01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:37.200
Oh my gosh, we just don't really teach doing the forecast thing. I think you guys get that from shiv's group. Yep

01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:39.360
We do. Yeah. Yeah

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:42.320
Yep. Okay. Cool. Thank you so much. That was very

01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:44.480
as usual

01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:48.000
Awesome. That was helpful. Okay. All right. Take care

01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:53.680
Um josh, I see you have a couple questions, but let me get to chris because he's been waiting patiently chris. What's up, man?

01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:55.920
Thank you for being patient waiting

01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:04.820
Is he there chris if you're there you're muted

01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:14.080
Yes, no, no, yes, okay

01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:16.960
all right, um

01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:21.200
All right. Oh josh you had some questions. Let me see

01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:26.880
Uh digital ad doi how to for yes, you did that manually

01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:31.520
Okay, is that something you guys recommend? I haven't made it through all the ad things yet

01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:37.520
It's not something that we like teach that you have to do but like it's something i've i've gone over with people like

01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:40.400
these are some changes you should make and do but it's

01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:43.600
it's uh

01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:45.360
Um

01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:50.080
There's some negative keywords that you'll just understand you just add like free cheap

01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:52.320
do it yourself

01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:55.120
you know this but there's like there's some areas that like

01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:57.760
like

01:01:57.760 --> 01:01:58.880
um

01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:03.520
Let me say like like how much would uh, like how much would it cost to have my tree? Yeah

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.120
okay, so like I would say that um

01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:10.080
like for me

01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:15.040
Like in one area that might work for me where maybe I do like like with janelle like she doesn't have a lot of

01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:16.960
Search volume

01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:21.760
So maybe allowing that question is not a bad thing because it maybe gets my site one more rep

01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:25.600
But if I was running that ad in a larger city

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:31.600
I maybe don't want to have I don't want to spend nine dollars for someone to ask the question about how much something costs

01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:34.720
so I don't really teach it as you have to do it because

01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:40.960
People are running ads in towns of 30 000 people and like you're doing it for 4 million people, right?

01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:45.440
So like it so it's gonna be different like it'll be different. So I try to not

01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:49.200
Like this is how it has to be done. It's more of like guidelines

01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:51.520
You could do this if it makes sense for you

01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:57.920
But there's small small population areas where like I don't mind if people call because there's not a lot of not a lot of search volume

01:02:58.080 --> 01:02:59.280
There's not a lot of competition

01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:01.520
So if my business owner is getting people on the phone

01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:08.160
Calling and asking them questions or sending in a form asking questions. That's one more person that they get to try to sell to

01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:13.440
If I get enough if I get enough of them and i'm like they're just kicking the tires and not converting

01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:15.760
I'll get rid of it. But yeah, so

01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:20.560
Because I see a lot of it not a straight answer but like that's why yeah that checks out

01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:26.160
It's a lot of in my search terms section. It's a lot of like how much do windows cost?

01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:32.480
How much to replace the window how much this or price this so I can see if it was a strategic way to

01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:35.680
how get more views that's a that's okay, but

01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:39.040
It's a lot of variations of those

01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:43.040
Yeah, and where you're running your ads out like this would be like

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:45.920
like

01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:50.080
Because you're running it to like a super major metro area millions of people

01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:56.880
Um, I would maybe talk to my business owner and go hey man, i'm seeing like this is a lower cost item

01:03:57.360 --> 01:03:58.720
Let's build you a landing page

01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:05.600
Let's build a sales funnel where we start collecting people's info and bring them through like a lead form type of thing

01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:09.840
To get a higher quality lead that's asking questions about how much something costs

01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:13.360
Got it. That's the thought right now all of a sudden

01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:19.200
Maybe that's a value now becomes maybe in a large area. It's an easy thing to break through the noise

01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:23.360
Someone's like well how much would it cost? Oh, you know, thanks for clicking our ad

01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:27.280
Like let's get some let's give you a good quote. How big's your house?

01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:34.320
How many windows you have how many are you interested in this or this and all of a sudden you're just bringing them through

01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:39.440
And if that person's serious, they're going to click through you may give them a freaking quote right there

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.520
over the computer

01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:42.640
And they're like, okay

01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:48.320
then now they have a range and now you're like maybe before you give them that hey give us your phone number or an email and

01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:50.400
We'll send you a quote right now

01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:56.000
Boom, and you set up a bot that sends an email and a text and it sends your business owner or something

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.680
But that's like super advanced

01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:02.080
That's why we don't teach metro area stay away from that until you like understand that stuff

01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:06.800
Some people will get that and be able to do that. But like again, that's like I said earlier

01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:08.480
What would I tell your friend?

01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:14.240
How much I would run it's going to be thousands of dollars a month. I'm gonna want from that guy, but that's why

01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:17.040
Those are the things that we'll do to help them convert. Yeah

01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:20.880
That's very helpful. Yeah, no problem

01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:24.160
And cool. All right, chris. Are you there?

01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:30.000
Give me a chance to get back on let me see here she google sheet by the way

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:32.960
Oh, yeah, that was pretty cool. Huh laura

01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:36.000
Uh, jason, I think we answered your question on keywords, I hope

01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:39.200
um

01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:41.200
Cool. All right

01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:46.960
Let me see no chris. All right, josh, you have any other questions at all? I do just one more

01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:51.840
Phrase match so I saw in the training that you teach to use the phrase match as

01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:55.840
Or keywords. Do you get into exact match as well?

01:05:56.960 --> 01:06:00.640
Oh, yeah. Yeah, there's nothing wrong with using exact match. It's just that

01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:03.360
when you're

01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:09.440
When you're running to the smaller cities and towns we're not typically running against like a bunch of ad experts

01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:10.640
so

01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:14.960
You don't really need to have the variation. I will I do tell people like if you're going to do like

01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:17.360
Tree trimming near me

01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:19.440
I would make that an exact match because

01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:23.920
Even though the phrase match tree trimming will cut will

01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:28.000
May land land an ad for that. There's a competitive

01:06:29.020 --> 01:06:30.320
advantage

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:32.480
Maybe a speed advantage to having

01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:36.080
A certain search term as an exact match

01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:43.040
Might fire like a millisecond less than a blink of an eye faster than something that's on a phrase match

01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:46.320
But again, we're talking about being in super competitive areas

01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:51.360
And then also a lot of students like I we have people that are very very new

01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:55.680
And they're like, I don't know anything about they're like still learning about keywords

01:06:56.400 --> 01:07:03.600
And it's a little different like that's why if you guys have seen francesca coming on on on fridays to like talk about like

01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:06.080
Because there's a difference between

01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:07.360
so

01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:10.000
You know taking a step back the long-term play is seo

01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:16.240
The short-term thing is you're going to use ads put your foot in the door and start making money and get business owners now

01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:23.120
Which is way better and faster than building ranking waiting and then go crap. I made a mistake

01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:27.840
There's six months down. I just wasted six months on this website, right?

01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:33.360
Or there's nobody in this area that wants to do it or their search volume's really bad or whatever it might be

01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:39.600
With the ads you're getting that yes or no so fast that it's worth the extra couple hundred dollars

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:43.040
Than it is to be like you either learn a mistake really fast

01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:46.160
You learn that this area sucks really fast

01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:51.200
uh, and it could just be like I mean there's a lot of places that i've gone to that i'm like

01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:53.440
on paper it checks out

01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:59.280
and i've done this in the past where I I learned first to like build and rank and then rent it out and

01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:01.360
I would get like

01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:06.880
All the numbers are here my ads this I are like my my website's here all this stuff

01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:11.120
I cannot get a business owner at all and take my leads because they're so fat and happy

01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:18.240
And so like nobody's like why why would I why would I uh pay you i'm i'm booked out 18 months in advance

01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:21.920
And then you find out that like shit. There's just not a lot of contractors in this area

01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:26.160
Or there's they have so much work that they're not worried about even they're

01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:32.160
Works waiting on them, right people are waiting on them. And so then you go. Oh shit. Okay, so

01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:35.360
You know making that mistake on an seo thing

01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:41.200
Is very frustrating because I have several sites that rank really well and still give occasional lead here and there

01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:44.880
Like

01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:47.600
I couldn't give it away. I can't give it away to people

01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:52.960
I've I have one where I had a guy that was driving four hours for certain jobs because they were that valuable

01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:54.460
I mean we're talking like

01:08:54.460 --> 01:08:57.360
300 000 jobs the guy's like yeah, i'll do that. I'm like, okay

01:08:57.920 --> 01:09:00.480
But it's like he's not going to take every lead, you know

01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:04.320
So it's just things like that. We're like i'm like, this is ridiculous. So

01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:10.080
By by doing nick's method, I would have done that first there. I would have test built a one pager

01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:15.840
Tested it out gotten some leads. I would have found that answer very fast and been like, okay

01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:18.960
Maybe this isn't hey, I don't want to spend my time and money here

01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:23.520
You know, you know, maybe i'll put it on the back burner come back to it in six months. Does that make sense?

01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:26.000
So it does yeah, it's very helpful

01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:30.160
Yeah, so that's why i'm just doing that to try to help you guys

01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:35.840
Understand the due diligence part, but then because when the when the program was first created

01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:38.960
We were using smart campaigns which were actually smart

01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:44.400
Which actually understood your broad match keywords and your website and understood that like

01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:47.840
Who you were and what you were trying to do and it pointed you in that direction

01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:52.960
So it was really easy and fast, but that's gone. So now we're stuck in expert world

01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:58.960
Where there's no medium world in the google ad space. So like we're trying to teach you like beginner

01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:05.600
Expert so like we're actually trying to teach you the medium level because that's who your competition is where the cities that we recommend

01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:10.240
That's really helpful and I appreciate you guys taking that approach. It's it's gonna pay off

01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:14.080
It does it does there's a lot of success stories here. I mean, there's people

01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:19.680
I mean, they're right. I mean they're passing they've passed me up and what I make so it's pretty awesome to see that

01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:22.160
You see people doing that. So

01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:24.160
Yeah

01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:28.240
Awesome. Well, I really appreciate you jumping on and helping me out with some of these i'm gonna have more questions for you

01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:33.520
So i'll be sliding in your dms and then wait for the next live chat room. Um, just want to say thank you so much

01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:38.400
Yeah, no problem. Like I said, we'll be here. I try to do it once once a week as my schedule permits

01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:40.400
So otherwise, that's it

01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:45.940
Cool. All right. Um, I think that's it. Let me see Janelle. Do you have any other questions?

01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:55.220
