00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Citations, okay?

00:02.000 --> 00:03.000
What are citations?

00:03.000 --> 00:06.000
I know that wasn't the question, but let's talk about citations.

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
I know we're going basic, guys, but citations.

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
Citations have to do with your Google My Business.

00:12.000 --> 00:17.000
The reason why we put that on the due diligence at the top is because citations are,

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
you guys remember when you set up your Google My Business

00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
and it asks you for the name, the address, and the phone number.

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000
It's called the NAP, N-A-P, right?

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
That is the core.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
That is the basis.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
That is the gospel.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
That right there, that name, address, phone number,

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
what Google's doing in a citation is where else around the internet

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
is that name, address, phone number listed exactly like that?

00:41.000 --> 00:43.000
Is it Yellow Pages? Is it Facebook?

00:43.000 --> 00:46.000
Where, what places are those three things,

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
name, address, phone number, cited across the web, okay?

00:50.000 --> 00:55.000
And the number of those typically does matter, okay?

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
The sheer volume of those.

00:57.000 --> 01:01.000
So if you go look at citations, and one person has 5,000 citations,

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
which I've never seen, they typically have less than 50,

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
but let's say they have 500 citations,

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
that's going to be somebody that you need to look at that, okay?

01:09.000 --> 01:14.000
But I want to clarify, citations have to do with the Google Maps,

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
have to do with ranking in the Google Maps section, not with the organic,

01:18.000 --> 01:23.000
even though technically a high ranking in the Google Maps

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
will influence your organic ranking.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
But when we're talking about citations,

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
and you look at the due diligence and it says citation,

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
we are referring to those things,

01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
where is your name, address, phone number that shows on Google,

01:37.000 --> 01:42.000
the exact one on Google, where else is it cited across the internet?

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
And how many places is it cited?

01:44.000 --> 01:49.000
That's citations, whereas backlinks is how many other websites

01:49.000 --> 01:54.000
are backlinked to you basically raising their hand and saying,

01:54.000 --> 01:59.000
hey, I endorse this guy, and I'm popular, I'm so-and-so, I'm Forbes,

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
and I endorse lasvegastreeservice.com, right?

02:03.000 --> 02:05.000
So that's the question there.
