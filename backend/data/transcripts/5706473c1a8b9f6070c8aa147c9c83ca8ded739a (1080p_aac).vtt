What's the biggest mistake people need to avoid when getting into rank and run?

00:07.280 --> 00:14.400
Uh, I would say launching too many sites at once, um, not being focused on a niche.

00:14.400 --> 00:17.760
And even if you are focused on a niche, like I would not go out and just build.

00:18.320 --> 00:20.480
I see people, I'm just going to build 50 sites, right?

00:20.480 --> 00:22.560
It's like, for what, right?

00:22.560 --> 00:23.920
Like you're gonna build 50 sites.

00:23.920 --> 00:25.520
It's like, let's get your skill.

00:25.520 --> 00:27.520
Again, it comes down to selling.

00:27.520 --> 00:28.560
You could have 50 sites.

00:28.560 --> 00:30.800
If you're not selling, you're not making money.

00:30.800 --> 00:34.000
So there's people that have one site and they're making money off that side.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.160
There's people that have 50 sites and they're not making anything because

00:36.160 --> 00:39.440
all they think about is like, let me just launch a new site, launch a new site.

00:39.440 --> 00:40.960
And I think you brought it up before.

00:40.960 --> 00:43.520
You could be ranking on page one, false could be coming in,

00:43.520 --> 00:45.680
but if you're not selling, you're not making any money.

00:45.680 --> 00:47.520
So I think that's a big, big mistake.
