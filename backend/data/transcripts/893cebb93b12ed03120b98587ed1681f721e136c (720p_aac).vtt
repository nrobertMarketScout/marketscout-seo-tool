00:00.000 --> 00:03.440
Hey, Gene, maybe I need to be focusing my guys in on these contracts.

00:03.440 --> 00:05.120
That's one area I might have gotten too smart.

00:05.120 --> 00:06.160
I just went month to month.

00:06.160 --> 00:09.520
And maybe they're dude, that's a hundred percent, bro.

00:10.800 --> 00:13.520
It's not even about the like, I'm not saying that's a hundred percent,

00:13.520 --> 00:16.240
but like, if you're not doing a contract, you're crazy.

00:16.240 --> 00:17.760
That's like why it's part of the process.

00:18.720 --> 00:21.360
It's not that if they sign a six month contract,

00:21.360 --> 00:22.640
you're even going to take them to court.

00:22.640 --> 00:25.920
Like, let's be real, the amount of money it's going to cost you to take them to court

00:25.920 --> 00:27.760
and how much you're going to get, it's not really worth it.

00:28.400 --> 00:31.040
The fact of the matter is when they know that there's a contract

00:31.040 --> 00:34.880
and they physically or they intentionally sign it,

00:35.840 --> 00:37.360
that is them committing.

00:38.320 --> 00:40.080
And I always use this analogy.

00:40.080 --> 00:43.600
Is it easier for someone to end a relationship

00:43.600 --> 00:47.200
that is like a boyfriend, girlfriend relationship or a marriage?

00:49.280 --> 00:52.080
You might have like some real shit going on in your marriage,

00:52.080 --> 00:54.880
but because you've committed, because you've gone through that process,

00:54.880 --> 00:56.080
you've signed that shit.

00:56.880 --> 01:01.760
And because it's not as easy to get out of without having a little bit of like shit happen,

01:02.720 --> 01:04.160
people think twice, man.

01:04.160 --> 01:07.920
People think twice, three times, four times, sign that thing.

01:07.920 --> 01:10.560
Even though you know damn well that like at the end of the day,

01:10.560 --> 01:12.960
you're probably not going to get anything from them in court.

01:13.520 --> 01:15.920
It's them signing, it's them committing.

01:15.920 --> 01:17.840
And here's how I pitched the contract, Gene.

01:17.840 --> 01:20.560
I say, look, yeah, of course there's a contract.

01:20.560 --> 01:21.760
I'm committing to you.

01:21.760 --> 01:23.760
I'm a hundred percent exclusive to you.

01:23.760 --> 01:25.680
I can't talk to any other business owners.

01:26.480 --> 01:30.720
If we don't do an agreement, then that's like me being committed to you,

01:30.720 --> 01:32.160
but you can quit at any time.

01:32.960 --> 01:34.080
I'm committing to you.

01:34.720 --> 01:37.680
I'm ceasing all conversations with business owners.

01:37.680 --> 01:38.640
I'm going all in on you.

01:38.640 --> 01:40.720
That's like having a marriage where only one person's married,

01:40.720 --> 01:42.160
the other person could do whatever the hell they want.

01:42.160 --> 01:43.200
It doesn't make sense.

01:43.200 --> 01:44.160
Yes, there's a contract.

01:44.160 --> 01:44.720
It's six months.

01:44.720 --> 01:47.840
At the end of six months, if you don't like me, I don't like you, we end that shit.

01:47.840 --> 01:49.760
But my guess is that at the end of this thing,

01:49.760 --> 01:51.760
you're just going to ask me if I can keep the price the same

01:51.760 --> 01:53.840
and not increase the price because I'm going to be killing it for you.

01:54.400 --> 01:55.280
That's how I pitch it.

01:56.560 --> 01:57.680
Don't shy away from it.

01:59.680 --> 02:00.560
Contract's not a big deal.

02:00.560 --> 02:01.520
We sign contracts every day.

02:01.520 --> 02:02.400
We get contracts on our phone.

02:02.400 --> 02:03.520
We got contracts in our houses.

02:04.160 --> 02:06.160
Most people have contracts on their cars.

02:06.160 --> 02:08.160
People have contracts on everything.

02:08.160 --> 02:09.360
We got all kinds of stuff.

02:09.360 --> 02:10.480
Isaac, we just went to the gym.

02:10.480 --> 02:12.160
We just signed a three-year contract in the gym.

02:12.800 --> 02:13.680
Contracts are part of life.

02:13.680 --> 02:15.360
Don't let people tell you, I don't do contracts.

02:15.360 --> 02:16.160
Bullshit.

02:16.960 --> 02:18.400
Ask them, did you pay for your phone outright?

02:18.400 --> 02:19.040
I actually did.

02:19.040 --> 02:21.520
Funny thing is I say that I actually bought the shit outright.

02:22.320 --> 02:26.240
But 99% of people, they have contracts.

02:26.240 --> 02:27.280
That's part of life.
