1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
All right. So I'm having a tough time figuring out if I'm picking the right keywords. So I just

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,360
went back to the keywords that you created. Okay. So I'm doing like a ton of analysis. Maybe I'm

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,920
doing too much. I'm analyzing like 26 keywords because I wrote it. I'm a programmer. So I wrote

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:19,920
an app to do all this for me. I'm not doing it manually. So I'm running like 26 keywords per city

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,200
and that's the screenshots I put in. So am I doing too much? Like how do I know

6
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,760
if those cities I pasted in are actually good? Yeah, I think you're doing too much. I mean,

7
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:37,120
look, I think people like you, I swear to you, and I mean this as a compliment, you guys are too

8
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:43,920
smart. The reason why this model works really well for people like me is because I'm like, all right,

9
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,000
I don't even have the patience to do more than like five or seven. I don't think you need more

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,680
than five or seven keywords to analyze a city. Okay. All right. So the second part was...

11
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:59,680
Let me say one last thing. So like tree service, I know that the lists are in here. I can share

12
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,080
those too. And guys, if you guys have lists or you've seen lists I've shared in the past,

13
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,760
that would be awesome for you guys to reshare those. I can also go and find them. But tree

14
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,720
service, you're looking at... Well, let's use concrete because it's just the one that was used.

15
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,920
So concrete is the core keyword. Then you got concrete contractors. I think concrete company,

16
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,560
concrete patio, concrete driveway, concrete sidewalk. There might be one more. I'm going

17
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,480
to use those keywords plus the city. And that's going to be enough for me to say yes or no on a

18
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,280
city.
