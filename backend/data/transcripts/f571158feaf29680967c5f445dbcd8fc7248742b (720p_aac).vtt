Okay, Ariel says, why do you not touch the ones that have CPC as NA?

00:05.600 --> 00:10.960
So the reason why real quick on that, Ariel, is because typically with CPC,

00:10.960 --> 00:12.240
think about it, right?

00:12.240 --> 00:13.280
Supply and demand.

00:13.280 --> 00:19.760
So if the cost per click is zero, that means there's nobody else bidding on it, right?

00:19.760 --> 00:21.120
There's no marketers.

00:21.120 --> 00:22.240
There's no business owners.

00:22.240 --> 00:24.080
There's no one else that's wanting to pay for those ads,

00:25.040 --> 00:29.680
which I can therefore infer that it's worth nothing, right?

00:29.680 --> 00:31.840
So for example, you're going to have a keyword like

00:32.640 --> 00:36.640
cheap concrete companies in Newport, whatever, right?

00:36.640 --> 00:38.320
That CPC is zero.

00:38.320 --> 00:40.560
Why? Because no one cares about it.

00:40.560 --> 00:43.760
So if you want to go like those CPCs,

00:43.760 --> 00:45.840
the reason why is because it's typically it's a waste of time, right?

00:45.840 --> 00:47.280
There's no volume.

00:47.840 --> 00:50.640
It says there's volume, but it's not worth anything.

00:50.640 --> 00:52.320
So if you want to go test it out, cool.

00:52.320 --> 00:55.760
And there's probably like a couple situations where, yeah, it's going to work.

00:55.760 --> 01:02.640
But I'm just using my intuition of saying, okay, there's CPC that's zero,

01:02.640 --> 01:05.440
which means nobody cares enough to pay for it,

01:05.440 --> 01:09.280
which means there's like one of many things, right?

01:09.280 --> 01:12.880
There's too much supply and not enough demand or vice versa.

01:12.880 --> 01:14.240
So that's why, okay?

01:14.240 --> 01:15.040
Hope that makes sense.
