{"text": " Okay. Bernie, I haven't reached the end of my initial contracts yet for my first clients. Any tips to get the renewal? Yes. Super simple. I like to bump things up. I like to give them a lot of soft touches leading up six weeks, a month up. Sometimes I'll bump the ads up a little bit just to make sure they have a really good month. And then we have the conversation. And I make sure to have the conversation about four weeks to two weeks out so that if they don't want to renew, I have time to go find somebody else. But yeah, make sure that that last two weeks, four weeks before you have the chat is a good one. Okay. And not only that you send them a lot of leads, but that they're actually closing deals. You got to make sure to stay in touch with these people. Make sure to have a lot of soft touches during that first six months. And then once you re-sign into that year, dude, it becomes a lot easier.
