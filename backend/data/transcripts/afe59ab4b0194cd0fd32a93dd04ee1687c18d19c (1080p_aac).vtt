WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.600
Okay, so now, talking about content, we need to expand our keyword list.

00:09.600 --> 00:15.000
The reason why we do that is because we want to have as many keywords as possible when

00:15.000 --> 00:19.480
we're writing content, that way we're not using the same keywords over and over.

00:19.480 --> 00:25.160
And we want to have an expanded, nice keyword list for each website and each project we're

00:25.160 --> 00:26.240
going into.

00:26.240 --> 00:29.340
So we personally use Basecamp.

00:29.340 --> 00:34.420
We don't necessarily recommend it, we got a free account for it, so that's why we're

00:34.420 --> 00:35.420
using it.

00:35.420 --> 00:40.380
But again, as long as you have, wherever you're keeping your keyword list, just make sure

00:40.380 --> 00:45.580
you're making a copy and you're putting this under your website that we're going after.

00:45.580 --> 00:49.540
So in my case, it would be Queen Creek, Arizona, Concrete.

00:49.540 --> 00:51.780
And this is the keyword list, okay?

00:51.780 --> 01:00.740
So we usually have about 20 to 30 keywords, and this is the very basic list for Concrete.

01:00.740 --> 01:06.860
Now I'm sure this is going to look different than your Concrete list.

01:06.860 --> 01:12.940
And again, like we said earlier, when we were building the website, Concrete is a little

01:12.940 --> 01:15.860
broad and a lot of companies will do different things.

01:15.860 --> 01:21.300
Some companies do coding, other companies do not do crack repair.

01:21.300 --> 01:26.860
So just make sure you're checking in with your client and follow up on what it is they're

01:26.860 --> 01:28.860
doing.

01:28.860 --> 01:36.580
Usually the main services are going to be stamped concrete, concrete driveway, and concrete

01:36.580 --> 01:37.580
patios.

01:37.580 --> 01:41.140
So those are the ones that you want to focus on most of the time.

01:41.140 --> 01:46.980
These numbers right here that you see, these are taken from SEMrush.

01:46.980 --> 01:51.580
So we use SEMrush, as I said before, you don't need to use it as well.

01:51.580 --> 01:52.780
It's just what we are using.

01:52.780 --> 01:54.300
You can use whatever you want.

01:54.300 --> 02:02.660
And so what we do is we actually plug in each keyword that we have and we see what the volume

02:02.660 --> 02:08.260
in search is just to get an idea on, okay, maybe stamp concrete is super important to

02:08.260 --> 02:10.060
put in our content, right?

02:10.060 --> 02:14.260
Because it seems like it's the most search out of all of them.

02:14.260 --> 02:16.620
And then concrete driveway, it's pretty well searched.

02:16.620 --> 02:17.780
Concrete patios as well.

02:17.780 --> 02:20.940
So that's why we do that, just to kind of get an idea.

02:20.940 --> 02:22.140
So go ahead and plug that in.

02:22.140 --> 02:28.060
And then after you have your basic one, make sure you also put your location.

02:28.060 --> 02:32.900
So concrete companies in blah, blah, blah, New York, Queen Creek, wherever you are trying

02:32.900 --> 02:34.380
to rank.

02:34.380 --> 02:35.380
Okay.

02:35.380 --> 02:43.780
After that, you are going to pick, in our case, our homepage was like concrete contractors,

02:43.780 --> 02:44.780
concrete company.

02:44.780 --> 02:51.780
So I already went ahead and expanded the concrete contractor keyword.

02:51.780 --> 02:58.460
So what I usually do is I actually highlight the, I would say between five to eight keywords

02:58.460 --> 03:01.660
that I'm going to expand on, okay?

03:01.660 --> 03:06.940
So this is usually a short tail keyword, which means it's short tail.

03:06.940 --> 03:08.940
Like I said, very short.

03:08.940 --> 03:12.420
And then there's a long tail keywords and they're both important when it comes down

03:12.420 --> 03:13.420
to ranking.

03:13.420 --> 03:14.420
They're just different.

03:15.060 --> 03:19.540
So a long tail keyword would be like in a full, like a lengthy one.

03:19.540 --> 03:23.740
For example, how much does roof repair cost?

03:23.740 --> 03:26.380
That's a long tail keyword.

03:26.380 --> 03:36.580
And so that's why we like to expand them because we want to try, the whole purpose is to write

03:36.580 --> 03:40.540
a content that includes things that people are searching for.

03:40.660 --> 03:46.100
And people that need a concrete driveway, most of the time will not just type in Google

03:46.100 --> 03:47.300
concrete driveway.

03:47.300 --> 03:54.540
They're going to type something like concrete driveway pricing near me.

03:54.540 --> 03:56.860
And that is a long tail keyword.

03:56.860 --> 04:00.980
So that's what most people are searching for, especially if people are like on their phone

04:00.980 --> 04:04.580
talking to Siri or anything, they tend to be more lengthy.

04:04.620 --> 04:10.660
So that's why it's important to include short tail keywords and long tail keywords because

04:10.660 --> 04:16.780
most of the time people are typing something more lengthy when they're looking for a service.

04:16.780 --> 04:21.700
And so I'm just going to highlight the keywords that I am going to expand.

04:21.700 --> 04:24.700
So we already did concrete contractor.

04:24.700 --> 04:26.660
I'm going to show you another one.

04:26.660 --> 04:33.220
Let's do concrete driveway.

04:33.340 --> 04:39.260
And usually you want to probably put this in order of importance.

04:39.260 --> 04:52.340
So I would probably put this concrete driveway up here since it's something that I want.

04:52.340 --> 04:53.340
Oops.

04:56.340 --> 04:57.900
Okay, there you go.

04:57.900 --> 05:00.340
And now let's expand concrete driveway.

05:03.340 --> 05:17.460
All right, so now enter and tab, okay.

05:17.460 --> 05:20.020
So how do how we do this?

05:20.020 --> 05:23.380
Once you kind of get the hang of it, you're going to do the same things like you're going

05:23.380 --> 05:28.020
to know that an extension to the concrete driveway concrete patio is going to be like

05:28.020 --> 05:30.380
near me cost residential.

05:30.540 --> 05:34.580
Like some of some of the extensions are always the same.

05:34.580 --> 05:35.900
So they're reoccurring.

05:35.900 --> 05:36.900
So you'll know.

05:36.900 --> 05:40.980
But one thing that it's really easy and I really like to do is just get into the Google

05:40.980 --> 05:52.020
search down here and just type concrete driveway and it's really nice because Google will tell

05:52.020 --> 05:57.900
you will give you ideas, will give you suggestions on where people are searching.

05:57.900 --> 06:02.540
And I like to put a space and then just start with the first letter of the alphabet.

06:02.540 --> 06:03.540
So I put a.

06:03.540 --> 06:08.700
Okay, we don't care for apron alternatives edition and patio.

06:08.700 --> 06:16.540
Okay, average cost could be something and think, think as if you were someone looking

06:16.540 --> 06:18.140
for this service.

06:18.140 --> 06:22.380
So think of, okay, I bought a house, I need a concrete driveway.

06:22.380 --> 06:27.900
What would I search if I had a buying intent on Google?

06:27.900 --> 06:32.540
Okay, average cost seems like someone who is looking to buy.

06:32.540 --> 06:37.100
Okay, nothing else really came to my head more than that.

06:37.100 --> 06:45.940
So let's start with B base border breaking up room finish base preparation.

06:45.940 --> 06:51.980
And again, I would rather put a lot of options there and then you can, it's always faster

06:51.980 --> 06:56.300
to edit and cancel things out other than adding them on later.

06:56.300 --> 07:00.340
So I'm not sure if base preparation, it's more of a DIY things that someone would do

07:00.340 --> 07:06.420
on his own, but we can put that in there and then we'll, we'll do a little more research.

07:06.860 --> 07:22.980
see cost contractors cost per square foot crack repair.

07:22.980 --> 07:29.100
I'm sure there's company and these are kind of already knowing because I've done this

07:29.100 --> 07:33.660
before and companies near me contractors near me.

07:33.660 --> 07:38.100
And again, concrete driveway contractors and concrete driving contractors near me.

07:38.100 --> 07:40.140
They are technically two different long tail keywords.

07:40.140 --> 07:43.220
One is more expensive than the other.

07:43.220 --> 07:47.140
See coding, crack filler and cost calculator.

07:47.140 --> 07:50.540
Cost calculator is a really good one because that really means that someone is wanting

07:50.540 --> 08:01.460
a quote mostly I'm already forgetting crack filler and coding.

08:01.460 --> 08:12.540
Okay, then I put a D designs could be one.

08:12.540 --> 08:17.740
We definitely do not want to put anything that it's DIY other than the only way you

08:17.780 --> 08:23.020
can talk about DIY stuff is if you're saying we do not recommend doing DIY because you

08:23.020 --> 08:27.700
can cause more damage and it's going to end up costing more.

08:27.700 --> 08:34.540
So you could put designs because especially if the contractor is offering stamped concrete,

08:34.540 --> 08:39.180
that may be a good way to kind of showcase the stamped concrete and the kind of design

08:39.180 --> 08:44.340
they can do on the driveway.

08:44.340 --> 08:56.060
Entrance again, think as a buyer, think of you really need or if you can come up with

08:56.060 --> 09:00.740
ideas, ask, ask a friend, ask a family member, say, hey, if you were looking to get a driveway,

09:00.740 --> 09:02.460
what would you search on Google?

09:02.460 --> 09:11.380
What would you, you know, and get ideas that way finishes.

09:11.380 --> 09:29.940
You probably want to stick away from financing.

09:29.940 --> 09:32.700
We're probably okay doing whole repair again.

09:32.700 --> 09:34.020
Those are like uncertain.

09:34.020 --> 09:38.660
You can even highlight in like a yellow or a green to make sure that you do check in

09:38.700 --> 09:49.700
with the owner of the company if they do actually do coating or, or repair.

09:49.700 --> 10:00.500
Installation installers near me, installation cost.

10:00.500 --> 10:03.020
You can even throw like concrete driveway.

10:03.020 --> 10:05.700
You can put Queen Creek in my case.

10:05.700 --> 10:17.060
You can put like your location, your state, I think I'm missing installation cost.

10:36.700 --> 10:42.620
Leveling, lifting again, you're really wanting to make sure that the company that you're

10:42.620 --> 10:45.900
working for does this.

10:45.900 --> 10:58.220
We definitely want to put them in there and then just highlight them.

10:58.220 --> 10:59.220
You could put makeover.

10:59.540 --> 11:02.180
Seems like someone who's doing maybe a new installation.

11:12.180 --> 11:26.100
Near me, options, overlay.

11:26.660 --> 11:29.620
Okay, I think I already put near me.

11:30.580 --> 11:31.380
Nope, I did not.

11:31.380 --> 11:31.700
Okay.

11:31.700 --> 11:36.820
Options near me is always going to be one of the options for most keywords.

11:36.820 --> 11:49.460
Options near me, overlay, overlay cost on a slope.

11:56.660 --> 12:02.660
Pavers, price per square foot, paving.

12:14.500 --> 12:20.900
The reason why we're putting so many extensions is because when people are searching on Google

12:20.980 --> 12:28.100
something, Google takes people to certain websites because they are trying to match

12:28.900 --> 12:37.460
the intent of what that person is searching to the best results that make answer that question.

12:37.460 --> 12:38.340
If that makes sense.

12:38.340 --> 12:42.820
So the reason why we want to expand and kind of cover as many questions and there's many

12:42.820 --> 12:47.780
options and possibilities because we want to try to gather everyone in the area of Queen Creek.

12:48.340 --> 12:55.460
For us, could be New York or Los Angeles, looking for anything, any of these services to us.

12:55.460 --> 12:57.780
So not just driveway and patio.

12:57.780 --> 13:00.500
We want to gather anyone looking for an installation.

13:00.500 --> 13:04.100
Maybe they are looking for stamped concrete, but they're typing installation.

13:04.100 --> 13:05.460
Maybe they're typing makeover.

13:05.460 --> 13:11.060
So we want to really gather everyone and that's why we expand the keyword list and we try to

13:11.060 --> 13:14.260
anyone that has a buyer intent in that location we want to get.

13:15.060 --> 13:18.820
Repair, rest facing, repair near me, replacement.

13:18.820 --> 13:21.380
Repair near me, replacement.

13:43.380 --> 13:45.700
Again, make sure like something like rest facing.

13:45.700 --> 13:46.900
Not everyone does that.

13:46.900 --> 13:48.980
so make sure that your company actually covers that.

13:51.460 --> 13:56.580
Sealer sounds, I would put Sealing Near Me. Sealer sounds like someone that is trying to

13:56.580 --> 14:02.980
buy something from those. DIY, Sealing Near Me sounds more like a service that needs to get done.

14:06.580 --> 14:10.260
Types, types could be a good option like someone is looking and

14:10.260 --> 14:14.180
you know types could go into stamp and here are the options.

14:17.860 --> 14:19.860
Quotes, quotes near me.

14:36.820 --> 14:38.820
I'm forgetting one letter we're on.

14:38.820 --> 14:45.860
Queen Creek, if I haven't put that in there, I already put it.

14:58.420 --> 14:59.860
You could put vendors.

15:08.820 --> 15:21.220
Okay I think we got most of what we wanted. Okay and that is how you expand a keyword list. Now

15:21.220 --> 15:27.060
you're going to do that. I would usually do whatever we end up doing, putting in the H1

15:27.060 --> 15:33.620
and we'll cover that later when we do on-page SEO. Whatever you want to really cover as a service

15:33.620 --> 15:39.460
page. So remember when we built a website we had a home page. Service page was concrete driveway,

15:39.460 --> 15:44.100
concrete patio, stamped concrete. So I really want to expand concrete driveway.

15:44.100 --> 15:49.940
My next one would probably be stamped concrete right here and the other one concrete patio.

15:49.940 --> 15:57.860
And then I would probably do also concrete company and that's it. So I'm going to highlight these so

15:57.860 --> 16:02.900
you can see them. I would do concrete contractor, concrete driveway, concrete company. These are

16:02.900 --> 16:08.260
the ones that I would expand stamped concrete and again it's just based on what your services

16:08.260 --> 16:14.420
are going to focus. Anything that is going to need like content for you, you want to expand.

16:16.500 --> 16:22.260
And that will make writing content a lot easier because once you write content on this page you're

16:22.260 --> 16:32.980
going to have all of these options to write about. And that is it.
