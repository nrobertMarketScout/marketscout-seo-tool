1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,040
Okay, guys, unemployable peeps, fellow rank and renters, what's going on, guys?

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,680
We're going to do a really just super impromptu.

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:16,280
I messaged Stephanie yesterday and I was like, hey, what do you think about going live with

4
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,280
me tomorrow?

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,760
And she you're like, well, it depends on what time.

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,960
And then I like two hours ago, I'm like, what about in two hours?

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,120
And she's like, I have a, you know, she had a closing call or something.

8
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,360
She's like, but I think I can make it work.

9
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,360
So let's do it.

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,000
We didn't give anybody a heads up, by the way, here's Porter.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,880
We'll let him in really quick.

12
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,320
We didn't give anybody a heads up.

13
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,640
We've just decided to go live, share her story, do this interview and look at this.

14
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,280
We've got dogs.

15
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,080
We've got babies.

16
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,880
I got to get something on my lap.

17
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,080
Bro, where's your kids at?

18
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:46,680
Yeah, I know.

19
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,080
So Stephanie, what's your dog's name?

20
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,120
This is Mike.

21
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,000
This is my niece.

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,840
This is Gracie girl, Gracie dog.

23
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,960
I like the name of me.

24
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,200
Great.

25
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,400
Ever since I watched the show Armageddon, I always loved the name Grace.

26
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,920
Really?

27
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,560
Grace.

28
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,400
And then we got Ford over here just munching on his hand or his toy.

29
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,560
Just going hard, dude.

30
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,280
I got the bottle.

31
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,240
I got a burp rag.

32
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,600
Just I'm ready to rip, dude.

33
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,600
How old is, how old is Ford now?

34
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,880
He's only, he's four months.

35
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,640
Oh, is, is Ford doing anything productive at the house?

36
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,600
He doing deals yet?

37
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,480
Or is he just like nursing and pooping?

38
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,680
Just sleeping and pooping.

39
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,920
But hey, he did sleep eight hours yesterday.

40
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,680
So get, get this baby, get this baby a whoop watch.

41
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,440
Let's see what kind of REM sleep he's hitting.

42
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,240
Oh, dude.

43
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,200
He slept like a baby.

44
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,080
I had to check his pulse.

45
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:31,720
I was nervous.

46
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,400
I love it.

47
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,320
Well, Porter, thanks for hopping on Stephanie.

48
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,040
Thanks for being on.

49
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,640
Anybody else that's on, appreciate you.

50
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,080
I know this is super just out of nowhere, but I hope a bunch of people will see this

51
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:41,480
interview.

52
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:47,000
So guys, today I want to interview Stephanie, me and Porter want to interview Stephanie

53
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,360
and talk about how to pre-sell your way to $8,600 per month.

54
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Um, Porter is also just so you guys know, just to, to have an idea of why I have him

55
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,960
on here, he's making a, is it 10, 10, six now Porter?

56
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,560
Yeah, 10, six.

57
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,200
I asked you that and making sure you didn't cancel seeing if you got any other deal.

58
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,800
So is that 10, six, uh, $10,600 per month.

59
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,960
Uh, I think a hundred percent of those are also pre-sales.

60
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,240
Yeah.

61
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:13,960
Okay.

62
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,960
So, um, I wanted to have these two on.

63
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,480
We're going to be interviewing Stephanie though.

64
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:21,080
But guys, the reason why I wanted to interview Stephanie is I love interviewing

65
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:26,440
people that I've worked with that I've literally watched start from zero, knowing nothing about

66
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,000
the business.

67
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,760
And then they persevere their way to where they're absolutely crushing it.

68
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,360
They've got momentum on their side.

69
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,920
And, uh, that's exactly what we've got here with Stephanie.

70
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:41,400
So, um, I looked this up before the interview, Stephanie, you, you started working with me

71
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,880
or you started, I guess, let's just say you started, uh, pre-selling or you started focusing

72
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,560
on the sales piece of this business on May 31st, 2024.

73
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,680
So let's call it June 1st.

74
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:55,880
So it's been 10 months, nine months, not even, not even that.

75
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,120
Okay.

76
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,880
Something, something like that.

77
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:02,520
And, uh, the interesting thing about Stephanie, and I'm excited to really get to hear her

78
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:07,240
story, but she didn't just, you know, sling five deals in the first week.

79
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:11,640
She, if I remember correctly from the post and from everything else, like there was a

80
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,480
little bit of a learning curve and there was some setbacks and stuff like that.

81
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,120
So, um, is that, is that, am I getting that right?

82
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,760
Or am I confusing this story with somebody else's?

83
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:21,640
Yeah.

84
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,760
No, you're a hundred percent correct.

85
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,400
I'm not a fronter.

86
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,080
I didn't, I didn't crush it out of the gate.

87
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,120
Yeah.

88
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,320
I was a late bloomer.

89
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,720
So, I mean, I'm, I'm gunning for you Porter now.

90
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,440
Like I'm, I'm crushed.

91
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,080
I'm going to be in five figures and I'm gunning for you, Papa.

92
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:39,720
But, um, so if you, once you pass Porter, I think there needs to be, you do send me

93
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,120
a message.

94
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,800
We'll, we'll do some kind of a little, uh, some little spit for you because I can't,

95
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,960
and I hope you do a post just roasting Porter.

96
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,600
Hey, I got, I got one cooking Stephanie, this, this week.

97
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,560
Did I for cooking?

98
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,520
I have for cooking.

99
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,560
Oh, yeah.

100
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,520
Stephanie's got for cooking, but you're, you're, I don't know, man.

101
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,520
Um, they're in the air fryer.

102
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,560
They're not in the slow cooker.

103
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:03,480
Like I'm telling you, like what I love about pre-sell, like I call it like pre-sell is

104
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,120
a microwave.

105
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,960
I'm like screw it, like no, no offense to Chevy and all the organic people out there.

106
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,000
God bless you.

107
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,440
But I am not into like that.

108
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,760
I call that the kimchi, like fermentation method.

109
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,760
I'm like, I don't have, I'm too fricking impatient.

110
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:20,040
And, and, and because I'll play devil's advocate, I think that a healthy bill, uh, uh, a really

111
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,760
healthy business, you probably have a combination of both.

112
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:27,000
So, um, maybe what we should do to, cause there might be some people that watch this

113
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,160
that are on later that, um, like what the heck is pre-sell?

114
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,680
What, what are you guys talking about?

115
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,440
I'm sure a lot of people do know what that is, but, um, it, let me have Porter, Porter

116
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,400
explain what we mean.

117
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,400
Cause obviously everybody knows the traditional method.

118
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,680
You pick a city, you pick a niche, you build a website, you start a business, you start

119
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,600
a city, you pick a niche, you build a website, you start doing SEO, it ranks, then you start

120
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,960
worried about selling it.

121
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,000
Porter really quick.

122
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,320
Why don't you just explain in a, in 10 seconds, what, what it is that we do when we talk about

123
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:53,880
pre-selling.

124
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:59,720
So basically instead of rank and rent, it's rent, then rank.

125
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:04,680
So build a one pager, run Google ads, use the leads that we get, sell them to a business

126
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,000
owner.

127
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,440
And then as soon as you collect credit card, go in and build it out.

128
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,560
So you're just, you're flipping the model completely.

129
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,440
Stephanie, anything you want to add to that definition or that description?

130
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:15,880
No, no.

131
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,600
I mean, I just a hundred percent Porter nailed it.

132
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,360
I mean, it's really, it's just a matter of you're, you're getting the money up front.

133
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:27,640
So then that you then can backfill it and do all the other fun stuff on the back end.

134
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:32,040
But you have a business owner who is paying you and then you can just block and load

135
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,760
onto the next one.

136
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:37,480
You know, what else is cool or what I was thinking about in like, cause I always like to

137
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:41,320
use an analogy or think about it as like regular real estate, but you know,

138
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:48,280
um, with, if you were to build apartments, let's say, of course there's people out there

139
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,320
that have a bunch of money.

140
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,760
They go, they, they, they, they've done it for so long.

141
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,840
They know what a good piece of land looks like.

142
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,880
They know the right location.

143
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,520
They know what it should cost per square foot, all that stuff.

144
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,640
They get investors, they put these projects together and then they start selling them.

145
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:01,880
Right.

146
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:07,000
But there's also people in like Dubai, for example, where these big companies,

147
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,640
I think it's called the Mac, the mock, these guys go in, they have the plan.

148
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,920
Then they start pre-selling.

149
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,840
They bring you in, they show you their showroom.

150
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,840
They say, Hey, we're going to do this plan for you.

151
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,960
You're actually going to pay for this right now and you're going to help us build it.

152
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,560
We're going to get you a lower rate.

153
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,240
But by the time this thing's built, it's going to be worth $50,000 more.

154
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:30,520
And you're going to have an apartment or a space in this, this huge complex

155
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,800
that you're going to own.

156
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,040
And so they literally have it self-funded by investors, by people like me and you.

157
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,840
So it's the exact same thing, guys, instead of us going and putting our own money,

158
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:42,840
our own effort, our own risk, we're literally going and saying, Hey, Mr.

159
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,040
Business Owner, I need you to fund the project that I'm going to own.

160
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,120
And what do you think?

161
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,080
And it sounds crazy if you think about it in like a real estate context,

162
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:56,040
because in the real estate example, the customer or the business owner would own the property.

163
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,920
But in this example, we own the property, even though they fund it.

164
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,760
So I like that.

165
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,320
I want to jump it.

166
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:08,280
Like, that was a little bit convoluted for my pea brain because I'm back in the US.

167
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,320
But in terms of real estate, I love that.

168
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:14,040
Because years ago, you know, I'm down in Vegas.

169
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:18,040
I know you're up a little north, but they had all these track homes, right?

170
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,920
And so they have phases and they roll them out in phases.

171
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:24,360
And if you buy in phase one, by the time they're still in phase seven,

172
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,000
they've already increased in price, exactly.

173
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,400
What we're doing is kind of like we're selling out of a trailer.

174
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,760
They haven't even built one yet.

175
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:35,400
So people are buying off plans, like they don't see it.

176
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:40,040
And so that developer is taking all those deposits and those sales

177
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,960
and using that money to build out everything.

178
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:49,720
Or they're building out either that development or they're using it to buy another parcel,

179
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,560
then to chop it up and do the same thing.

180
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,480
So it's OPM.

181
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,520
It's other people's money.

182
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,480
That's a great term.

183
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,760
OPM, other people's money.

184
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,880
The only difference between the examples that we're using and this

185
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,520
is that we're actually owning the property.

186
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,560
Whereas in those examples, the person paying the money would own the property.

187
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,560
We also get to own control and keep the property

188
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,160
that we can then go and sell eventually and all this other stuff.

189
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,600
So super exciting.

190
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,680
The cool part about it, guys, is that if you guys are in this program

191
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,000
and you guys are in Unemployable, you guys are in the right place.

192
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,160
You have the fundamentals down pat.

193
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,760
Shiv is the best in the game when it comes to teaching all things,

194
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,880
SEO, backlinks, content, building a site, ranking a site.

195
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,800
And then what I do is I like to show people how to do it fast.

196
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,320
And so that's what we're going to talk about today.

197
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,360
So let me just share my two goals for this interview.

198
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,600
Number one is I want to inspire and motivate you guys

199
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:45,000
that if you'll stay the course, that you are in the right place

200
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,360
and you will find success because you're going to see

201
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,760
that didn't happen overnight for either of these two people.

202
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,840
And then I want to at least give you one actionable takeaway

203
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,600
that you can take this week and implement and push it into your business

204
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,040
to move the needle in the right direction.

205
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:02,680
OK, so here's the reason, Nick, why are you doing this?

206
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,480
Why are you coming to this group?

207
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:08,520
Well, the reason why, guys, is that I did this exactly like you guys are doing it.

208
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,400
I did the rank, then the rent.

209
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,600
I did it did work.

210
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,000
I got deals, but I could never scale.

211
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I could never get to the numbers I wanted.

212
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,840
Money that excited me was one hundred thousand a month.

213
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,640
And I started doing the projections and it just never made sense

214
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:25,640
for me to go build out a hundred websites to then try and scale.

215
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,480
And so as soon as I figured out pre-selling, it unlocked

216
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,800
two things that were constraining me.

217
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,760
Number one is time.

218
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,440
Number one, number two is money, right?

219
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,240
Because now I use other people's money, like Stephanie said, OPM.

220
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,640
And I don't have to wait six months for a website to rank.

221
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,520
So I've got some questions I want to ask Stephanie.

222
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,920
And then I'll let you guys ask any questions you have, Porter.

223
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,640
I'm probably going to ask you some, Porter, if you have questions for Stephanie.

224
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,360
But I just want to run through these and we'll keep this nice and tight.

225
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,800
And hopefully there's at least one person that we help on this live.

226
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,640
And then hopefully a bunch of other people will see it.

227
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,440
Okay. So that's not fair.

228
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,120
Cool.

229
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,000
Amazing. Okay.

230
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:05,000
Okay. Real quick, because I don't know if anyone knows the full story,

231
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,480
but let's just talk before this whole world of digital real estate.

232
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,760
What were you doing for work?

233
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:18,200
The one year before I started this, I worked for a 501C3, which in the U.S.

234
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,320
That's a nonprofit.

235
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:19,820
Yep.

236
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,880
I was a salaried employee for $40,000 a year.

237
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:30,520
And I taught elementary school kids how to grow fruits and vegetables and plant gardens.

238
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,440
Interesting.

239
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,240
I did that for one year because I had just moved back to the United States.

240
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:42,600
For the 13 years prior to that, I was living in Europe and New Zealand.

241
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:48,040
And so I was, but right before that, like during COVID and everything, I was in Greece

242
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,000
and I ran for 10 years, I ran a vegan cooking school.

243
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,280
Okay.

244
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,560
It's pretty much like rank and rent.

245
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:54,360
Yeah.

246
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,240
No, but I've always been in sales.

247
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:05,560
And so I love planting, I love food, I love landscaping, and I love teaching.

248
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,920
And so I was on my feet.

249
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,440
And then when I came back to the U.S.

250
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,920
And I had to move back to the U.S. because my parents are old

251
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,080
and I had to come back to see them.

252
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,440
Otherwise I would still be in Europe.

253
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,080
So I came.

254
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:19,400
Hold on.

255
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,360
So where are you at right now?

256
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,320
What city?

257
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:21,800
Vegas.

258
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:22,840
Okay.

259
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,040
That's why I thought that.

260
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:27,480
And I was thinking, and you just really referenced Vegas, but for some reason, anyway.

261
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,040
So, okay.

262
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:28,760
Good old Vegas.

263
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,520
How's the, by the way, real quick, not to detract, but-

264
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,640
Dude, it's freaking raining today.

265
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,040
It's raining.

266
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:32,760
Oh, okay. Good.

267
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,800
I'm glad you're suffering as well.

268
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,600
All day.

269
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,840
Like, like, yeah, I was like, where's my raincoat?

270
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,480
Yeah.

271
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:37,640
Yeah.

272
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,240
Porter, is it snowing in Parowan?

273
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:40,520
Tonight.

274
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,200
It's supposed to snow a couple inches tonight.

275
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,360
So you guys need it, but keep it over there.

276
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,960
Are you in St. George, Nick?

277
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,360
I'm in St. George, but Porter's like an hour north.

278
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:48,600
I know.

279
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,400
It's not that far.

280
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:49,640
Yeah.

281
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:49,880
Yeah.

282
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,040
Yeah.

283
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,760
It's raining here, but it's going to snow there because it changes a lot.

284
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,640
The temperature of that.

285
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,160
I have all my besties are up.

286
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:55,720
They all go up.

287
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,160
They're all up at Duck Creek.

288
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:57,560
Oh, okay.

289
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:57,720
Yeah.

290
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,200
Yeah.

291
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,200
That's going to be cold in Duck Creek for sure.

292
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,680
And if you're up there, you say Duck Creek, not Duck Creek.

293
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,120
Just let's get the record.

294
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:04,520
Okay.

295
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,000
All right.

296
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,400
Guess what?

297
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,000
I know it's hurricane and not hurricane.

298
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,920
I got it.

299
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,640
I got it.

300
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,680
You know the area.

301
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,640
So, okay.

302
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,920
So you were doing, right?

303
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:17,640
A year before, you were working for a nonprofit and now you're doing this.

304
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:22,040
So in all of your previous years when you were in Europe, did you ever have any sales experience,

305
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,800
tech experience, anything like that?

306
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,120
Okay.

307
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,960
So I have less than no tech experience.

308
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,280
I would tell people, I'm like, I can't even spell IT.

309
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,720
That's actually kind of a funny joke.

310
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,440
Like literally, I had people, I thought about it today.

311
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:45,640
The last time I used Excel was when I came to UNLV in 1991 for graduate school.

312
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,280
By the way, that was the year I was born and they were really good that year too.

313
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,000
Dude, the running rebel.

314
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,320
Dude, like F Duke, by the way.

315
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,760
Like I bleed red.

316
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,280
I'm a running rebel all through and through.

317
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,080
F Duke.

318
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:57,320
Yeah.

319
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,800
Anyway, yes.

320
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,680
So no, I can't stand IT.

321
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,200
I always outsourced it.

322
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:09,080
I have a back, before I had a cooking school, I have a background and I was a recruiter.

323
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,280
I was a headhunter.

324
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,880
I have a background in selling mortgages.

325
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,160
Like I've always been in sales.

326
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,600
So the sales problem was nothing for you, but the tech.

327
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:17,800
Yeah.

328
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:18,840
Okay.

329
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:23,320
This isn't a question I had, but how is selling this different than selling

330
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,800
mortgages or anything else that you've sold?

331
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,760
Well, it's a lot easier.

332
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:34,120
It's because it's your Costco thing, right?

333
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,720
Because you give them free samples.

334
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,200
Like I can't sample you on a freaking mortgage.

335
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,640
I so agree with that.

336
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,520
Like, you know, like, okay.

337
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,080
So now that, you know, like for those who are like kind of high,

338
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,280
it's a little high level here.

339
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,280
If you don't know what I'm talking about, you know, go look it up.

340
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,400
But, you know, you don't have a lead magnet in mortgages really.

341
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,360
Like, what am I going to do for you?

342
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,160
Like, okay, I can run a free credit report for you.

343
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:53,400
Yeah.

344
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,600
But I can't let you feel how it is to be in the new house.

345
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,520
I'm not going to do like a little demo closing,

346
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,600
you know, like, you know, signing.

347
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,120
I mean, like, you know, you got to cut.

348
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,880
There's a little bit, there's a little more faith.

349
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,320
You know, you're betting on the come.

350
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:09,960
So, you know, in terms of the cook, my cooking school, people were like,

351
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:13,640
I would sell these big giant packages and they're like, you know, like,

352
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,200
I was like, my biggest package was like, you know,

353
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,240
$7,000 to come train with me in Europe.

354
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,960
And so these, I was selling, I taught in English,

355
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,440
even though we were in Spain and Greece, but we taught in English,

356
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,640
because it's an international language.

357
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,600
So I was selling to people from India and Canada and Australia.

358
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,480
So they had to buy their ticket to come stay with me for a month.

359
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,920
And then they had to pay me $7,000.

360
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,200
And then they had to also lock,

361
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:40,280
put themselves up in a hotel or Airbnb for seven weeks or whatever.

362
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,640
So it was, you know, it was high ticket sales.

363
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,160
And they're like, how do I know you're any good?

364
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,040
I'm like, well, you don't, but they can watch videos.

365
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,080
You know, like, here's an example.

366
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,760
So I could do a little bit of, you know, free sampling,

367
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,560
but you don't know.

368
00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:00,120
But what we're doing right now with the way you do the pre-sales,

369
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,040
we're giving them sample leads.

370
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,320
They're the exact same thing.

371
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,000
It's not like, it's not a scaled down, it's not an abridged version.

372
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,360
It's the exact same thing.

373
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,640
As long as you make sure you give them good leads.

374
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,000
I mean, you don't want to give them scrub leads.

375
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,640
You know, you cherry pick your own leads

376
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,320
and then you send them to the BO.

377
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:19,820
100%.

378
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,960
From somebody, I sold, of course, a couple of different things,

379
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,520
but selling alarm systems compared to this, I always tell people,

380
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:31,240
this is like, not that it's easy per se,

381
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,520
because it's obviously takes some work and some skill once you,

382
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,200
but you don't, by the way, just so you know,

383
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,800
you don't need sales experience to do this.

384
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,520
Porter had zero sales experience.

385
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,000
The only thing he ever did in terms of work was worked on the farm.

386
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,200
For me, I sold door to door and selling this,

387
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,320
I sit there and I'm like,

388
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,760
people are complaining about picking up the phone.

389
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,920
I'm like, look, you don't have to knock on a door.

390
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,680
You don't have to go in the sun or under the rain.

391
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,200
You don't have to get the door signed on you,

392
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,120
a gun pulled on you, any of this kind of crazy stuff.

393
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,320
You get to pick up the phone.

394
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,200
And not only do you get to do it from the comfort of your home,

395
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,040
but you get to call and say,

396
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:05,160
do you want something free that you're already paying for?

397
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,440
I mean, how hard of a sale?

398
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,520
That's the initial sale.

399
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,520
And then you're into the actual sales process.

400
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,160
So Porter, for you on this note,

401
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,680
how difficult was it for you from somebody that had no sales experience

402
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,720
jumping in and trying to do sales?

403
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,960
The first couple were definitely a little bit uncomfortable, I would say.

404
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:27,320
I think I remember I answered the first one,

405
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,600
or I called the first business owner and I think I totally,

406
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,560
like diarrhea, the mouth, just everything.

407
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,920
He asked me a question, I answered it.

408
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,520
So they definitely go smooth,

409
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:40,840
but it definitely helps when you have a structure that's laid out for you,

410
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:44,040
something that you can follow and have a process.

411
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,640
But I mean, it definitely was a lot easier than I had anticipated.

412
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:52,360
I always tell people the business model is very simple, but it's not easy.

413
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,800
It still requires work.

414
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,800
It's not going to be like this quick, easy cash,

415
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,120
but it's a lot easier in a lot of things.

416
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,040
Okay, let's keep going.

417
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,360
I like what you said.

418
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,080
The first time you do anything, you suck.

419
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:08,680
I mean, whether it be bake a cake or paint a billboard, whatever you do,

420
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,720
the first time you do anything, it's not your best one.

421
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,200
I mean, the first time, I'm sure Nick, you did a live.

422
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:19,480
Look at your lives and your content and your courses now versus your very first one.

423
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,920
I mean, whatever it is, your first one is never your best,

424
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,520
but you got to start somewhere.

425
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,720
Yeah, great point.

426
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,000
Really good point.

427
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,640
Okay, so this is a question.

428
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,160
I'm not looking for any specific answer.

429
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,360
I legitimately want to know because I remember for me how it felt,

430
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:38,040
but from comparing it to when you were at zero,

431
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,960
you're starting this business, you're cutting your teeth,

432
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,200
you're not really sure what you're doing.

433
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,680
I'm going to ask you and then Porter.

434
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,360
Stephanie, you're making 8,600 bucks a month.

435
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:49,880
Obviously, that's top line, but how does it feel knowing,

436
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,400
hey, this actually works and I can do this and the sky's the limit?

437
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,160
Does that get you excited?

438
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,400
Does that get you overwhelmed?

439
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,960
Does it make you anxious that you should be doing more?

440
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:04,920
How do you feel knowing, hey, I've made it 8,600 a month, but how do you feel?

441
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,480
I think like you said in a lot of your videos,

442
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,480
you just got to get one already, you're built.

443
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:16,920
And then even after I did one, I kind of laughed because I watched so many of your videos.

444
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,040
I mean, so many.

445
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:21,640
I mean, literally, no offense, I kind of got sick of watching you.

446
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,360
I was like, oh, and it got to the point where like,

447
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,840
oh, is it like blonde Nick or is it brown Nick?

448
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,440
Is it bearded Nick or is it not Nick?

449
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:33,880
I'm like, but I mean, I watched tons and tons of content

450
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:40,200
and just to really get it dialed in while I was going through your content

451
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,080
and getting going.

452
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,240
And I believed everything you said.

453
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,000
I didn't think you were just blowing smoke,

454
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,400
but you know, and I was like, oh yeah, I want to feel that too.

455
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:52,520
And even though I did one, I still even, not that I had,

456
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,000
I'm like, okay, I knew I could do it before.

457
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,600
And then after I did it, I knew I could do it.

458
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:02,440
But then I knew that, okay, now you just go do more.

459
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,600
And again, like my first one wasn't the best.

460
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:12,040
I now was debriefing or troubleshooting the things I did wrong in the first one.

461
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:12,920
And you just get better.

462
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,080
You tweak it and you find out what works for you.

463
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,120
So was it overwhelming?

464
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:16,600
No.

465
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,560
Do I feel like I should be working?

466
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,360
I think every single person in your bit,

467
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,640
what I love about this business is every single person can do their version of it.

468
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,640
Because you do have a lot of people who are doing like, I'm not one of them,

469
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,880
but I know like you asked the other day in the group, you're like,

470
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:33,240
who's still doing a nine to five and then it's slamming deals on the side.

471
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:33,960
I'm not doing it.

472
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,440
This is all I do full time.

473
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,080
I knew for me, like this is the bandwidth that I had.

474
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,960
And where I am in my life, I needed to do this full time.

475
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,680
So I just wanted to speed it up.

476
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,360
But that's not right for everybody.

477
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,960
But everybody can do it.

478
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:51,160
I think the important thing though is for people who are going to do it on the side,

479
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,640
because like, you know, I know you're a blind guy.

480
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,880
People who don't speak English is a first language guy.

481
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,320
You have like, you know, you're a guy with people with kids and this and that.

482
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,440
Can anybody do it?

483
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,080
Absolutely.

484
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,440
Is it more difficult with all those other things on your plate?

485
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:05,500
Yeah.

486
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,180
But is it undoable?

487
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:07,820
No.

488
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:13,020
So it's just a matter of keeping your priorities straight and that's it.

489
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:17,340
And so all I did was reverse engineered where I wanted to be.

490
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:20,380
Like when you bring people in, the first thing you have us do,

491
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:23,100
and once we get into your paid group, is to do our map.

492
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,620
You just got to do your map.

493
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,620
And I call the map the reverse engineer.

494
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:27,580
It's like, okay, where do you want to be?

495
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:32,220
Okay, well, if you know where you want to be, then now it's like that's the end.

496
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,220
Like if you put on Google Maps, like that's the end point.

497
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,580
But you know where you are now.

498
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:39,260
Now you got to reverse engineer it and work backwards and put in all the steps.

499
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,620
Because that's what people get overwhelmed.

500
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:44,300
Like, I mean, okay, I think most people do, but I mean, I could say I do.

501
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,780
And the way to not get overwhelmed is that old adage, you know,

502
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,700
like how do you eat an elephant one bite at a time?

503
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:53,420
So you break it down into baby steps and, you know, you check stuff off and you feel good.

504
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:56,300
And then, you know, just landing your first deal is like checking a big step off.

505
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,660
I mean, it feels really good.

506
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,820
You know, and then you just go to the next one and, you know,

507
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,420
and you just keep on moving, get momentum.

508
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:02,700
Yeah.

509
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,980
No, I really like that.

510
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:08,780
I still remember, guys, my very first deal that I remember the first dollar I made online.

511
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:11,580
And I remember the first pre-sale deal that I did.

512
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:12,620
It was back in 2020.

513
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:14,140
I'm not going to tell you guys the whole story.

514
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:17,340
And by the way, Ford, I'm coming to ask you how you fell in your first deal.

515
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,940
So zip your lip for a second, bud.

516
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:19,500
No, I'm just kidding.

517
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,660
I'm going to ask him.

518
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:22,380
I'm going to ask him.

519
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,020
Don't worry.

520
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:25,420
But I remember it was like this idea.

521
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,620
I think we can pre-sell.

522
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,660
I don't know if we can.

523
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,980
And we did a test.

524
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:30,940
We had a site.

525
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:33,180
Actually, at this time, I was still building organically first.

526
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:36,780
I had a site that was generating a couple of leads, ran some ads to it,

527
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:40,380
did kind of a version of my process that I teach now, but it wasn't perfect.

528
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:45,260
I got in the closing call and it was the easiest close I ever did.

529
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:47,820
And I remember getting off holding the credit card digits.

530
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:48,940
I wasn't even expecting the deal.

531
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,540
I had to write down the credit card or the piece of paper.

532
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:53,100
And I was like, first of all, I was shocked.

533
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,700
Second of all, I ran the card.

534
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,340
And then all of a sudden, my mind was like just blown.

535
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:01,340
I'm like, oh my gosh, I could make any amount of money possible

536
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:03,980
because now I can do this without waiting for it to rank.

537
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,340
It was like, it just clicked.

538
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,660
And I was like, okay, this is the key.

539
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:11,420
This is that one missing piece that I think the model was missing.

540
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:15,900
So, Porter, without further ado, since Ford's raised his hand in his own way,

541
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,420
wanting to tell us how did you feel?

542
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:21,900
How do you feel at 10,600 bucks a month never having run your own business,

543
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,780
never having really worked any other job besides on the farm,

544
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:28,140
and now you're renting simple websites to local business owners

545
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:31,580
and basically doing sales to do that without having any experience?

546
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,140
How did that feel?

547
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:36,380
It honestly gives you a lot of confidence.

548
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:40,060
It's like knowing that I can still do this while doing something that I love.

549
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:44,060
So if anything, it's allowed me to be more confident in myself

550
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:49,260
that I can support a family, myself, go and do and be who I want to be

551
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:53,660
without having to do a nine to five or work some other job.

552
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:54,300
You know what I'm saying?

553
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:57,100
Like it's a weird thing, but it's like a mental thing too.

554
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,620
The money is great.

555
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:01,740
But what it does to be able to know that you can always make more money

556
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:05,660
and that the sky's the limit, it makes you want to always do more

557
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,660
because you're around people that are doing so much more than you.

558
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,100
But dude, it's the greatest feeling.

559
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:11,820
Gives you a ton of confidence.

560
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:15,260
I've seen the thing I love most is when I see people that start at zero

561
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:19,580
and then I see them when they made their first deal or 5K, 10K,

562
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,020
is their confidence is night and day.

563
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:21,900
And that's really fun for me.

564
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,700
So, okay, let's keep going.

565
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:26,140
Stephanie, was there a moment or time that you almost gave up

566
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,500
or thought about quitting?

567
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,380
Be honest.

568
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,740
And if so, how'd you get through?

569
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,700
I never thought about quitting because I didn't get myself an out.

570
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:38,540
I assumed that was going to be your answer, by the way.

571
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,060
But I keep going.

572
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:40,940
I want to hear the rest of it.

573
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,140
But I will tell you, did I scream?

574
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:44,780
Did I yell?

575
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:45,820
Did I cry?

576
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,580
Did I have sleepless nights?

577
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:52,460
Did I want to freaking punch like you and other people?

578
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:52,960
Absolutely.

579
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,840
The nearest baby.

580
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,680
Believe me, it's not all a bed of roses.

581
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,880
It's like, oh, golf's easy.

582
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,560
All you do is you just hit this ball in this little hole.

583
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,520
I have a friend who's a big...

584
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,480
I know you play golf, Nick.

585
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,680
I have a friend who plays golf.

586
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,920
He never swears.

587
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,880
Never, ever swears.

588
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,880
He's the most mild-mannered guy.

589
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,280
And I'd be like, hey, Mike, how's it going?

590
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,880
I'm like, hey, how was golf today?

591
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,560
And he's like, F golf.

592
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,160
Literally, he was like, golf.

593
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,560
That's the only time he swears is when he talks about golf.

594
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,960
So it's simple, but it's not easy.

595
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,600
How did I get through it?

596
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,400
I literally said...

597
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,480
And it was actually somebody in your group.

598
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,600
I think it was Levi that was helping me, and I was talking to him.

599
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,240
And Levi's one of your students down in Australia.

600
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,480
I was like, Levi, this freaking dude Dylan's just like, volume this.

601
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,360
I'm like, God damn it.

602
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,240
I'm like, man goes this.

603
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,120
I'm like, in some rush, assholes and blah, blah, blah.

604
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,960
I get like, dude, I'm not afraid.

605
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,880
I know I might sound like a sailor.

606
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,920
I'm like, God damn it.

607
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,520
I'm like, what the heck?

608
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,880
And then at the end of the day, he was like, he's like...

609
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,960
It was because he literally said to me, he's like, you know what, Stephanie?

610
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:12,400
He's like, he said, and I was worried about going into cities

611
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,400
where there were other lead gen people.

612
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,240
And he's like, look, he's like, I'm not afraid of that.

613
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,360
I'm like, really?

614
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,080
Why?

615
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,400
And he said, because I know I can outlive him.

616
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:26,560
I have the strength and fortitude and acuity and knowledge and everything.

617
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,520
He's like, I'm not afraid of them.

618
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,680
And I went, huh.

619
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,520
I mean, granted, he has years experience than I did.

620
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,400
But I went, oh, okay.

621
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,520
Well, I'm like, well, that makes sense.

622
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,280
And then I can't answer this.

623
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:47,120
I don't know what happened, Nick, but I swear to you that what happened was

624
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,960
I just had an aha moment.

625
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,960
And I don't know whether it was from one of your videos,

626
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,160
like where you actually said it or whether or not I got the feeling.

627
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,680
I don't know exactly when it happened.

628
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,360
But I had this feeling, this thought, and then I had the feeling.

629
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,680
I'm like, I don't know how I'm going to make this work.

630
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,360
I just know it's going to work.

631
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,840
And that was it.

632
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,520
And then I never deviated from that.

633
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,040
So no matter what, I'm like, okay.

634
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,480
What I did last week and last month, that isn't working.

635
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,600
And I'm like, I make changes a lot.

636
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,960
And I made changes this week and big changes.

637
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,280
And I'll talk to you about them in a little bit if you want.

638
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:30,720
But I mean, I'm constantly reevaluating and assessing

639
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,400
because all I feel is like when I'm doing things that aren't working, that's data.

640
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,520
And then I'm like, if I'm doing stuff that I know isn't working, then stop it.

641
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,600
Yeah, that's it.

642
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:40,880
I like that.

643
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,040
Yeah, I don't even have anything to add.

644
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:46,080
I could say something, but it would be the exact same thing that you said in my own way.

645
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,280
So let's just leave it and move on.

646
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,840
Next question I have, and this is going to be specifically for you, Stephanie,

647
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:56,080
is why did you decide to start pre-selling

648
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,440
versus just waiting for websites to rank due in the traditional way?

649
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,200
I'm impatient.

650
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,000
I'm not willing to wait.

651
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:07,840
Again, I think the organic way is a great play.

652
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,400
I think it's super for the right person who's patient

653
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:14,720
and a person who loves to be sitting behind the computer and loves doing more of the

654
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,480
SEO and the ranking and this and that and wants to just like,

655
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,640
they're the pressure cooker people.

656
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,000
Oh, let me set it and forget it.

657
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,160
No, I want it now.

658
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,000
I want it now.

659
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,560
I want the microwave version.

660
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,120
Air fryer.

661
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:29,840
I want it now.

662
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,480
I don't have time.

663
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,400
It's like in or out.

664
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:36,320
I tell people I'm like, this is not rocket science.

665
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,520
We are not building.

666
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,800
I'm not a brain surgeon and you are not a rocket scientist.

667
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,400
I laid it out.

668
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,520
This is what it is.

669
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,480
That's why I don't do any of those.

670
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,680
I call them TOs.

671
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,720
No thinking over.

672
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,840
None of that bizzo.

673
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,920
I'm like, dude, you know it.

674
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,880
You know right now.

675
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,280
I don't hit them this hard.

676
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,880
But I will say this about whoever's watching, by the way,

677
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,360
I want to back up and I do want to share this

678
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,880
because I know I sound like a royal.

679
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,320
I know I come across strong now,

680
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,560
but I will tell you when I on the other side,

681
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,560
when I first saw your videos, Nick,

682
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:11,680
like I had seen your stuff and when I first

683
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,760
was just learning about the rank and rent industry

684
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,800
because I didn't know about it,

685
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,200
I knew I wanted to work online.

686
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,600
I just didn't know in what venue

687
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,960
because I knew I had to do something that was online

688
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,440
and I really wanted something that had recurring revenue.

689
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,520
And so for a hot minute, I was doing credit card sales,

690
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,760
merchant services, because that has residuals.

691
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,240
I didn't want to do insurance that has residuals.

692
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,160
I didn't want to be a stockbroker.

693
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,280
Like I hate the stock.

694
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:37,840
I hate the market.

695
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,560
I didn't want to get licensed in series seven, blah, blah, blah.

696
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,040
I didn't want to go that route.

697
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,440
But I wanted to have something where there was recurring revenue.

698
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,720
I don't want to sell high ticket sales

699
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,200
because those are one hit wonders.

700
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,720
I don't want to be like one and then done.

701
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,320
So this really ticked on my boxes.

702
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,440
But when I first looked at your stuff,

703
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,360
I mean, I saw all your stuff

704
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,520
and with your strong personality, I was a little taken back.

705
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,120
And I knew who you were.

706
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,080
I saw you.

707
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,600
I'm like, wow, this kid's intense.

708
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,240
Everybody has their own process.

709
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,360
It took me a while to warm up.

710
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,080
And I'm like, it wasn't until I got in and learned the model.

711
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,440
And then I watched, there's that guy, what's his name?

712
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,680
Like James Dooley, like the guy over in the UK.

713
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,880
Like I was watching all his, do you know him?

714
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,120
Yeah, I don't know him personally, but I've heard the name, yeah.

715
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

716
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:30,240
So basically he's like just crushing it in the UK.

717
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,560
Like he's like his own age refs, whatever.

718
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,520
He's like crushing it over there.

719
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,800
But I'm like, you know, and I was like, wow, you know,

720
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,440
like so many people from all different walks of life are killing it.

721
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,160
And I'm like, oh, it all makes sense.

722
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:47,360
And every single person in my real life,

723
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,800
you know, my family and friends,

724
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,440
when I would tell them about this industry,

725
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,560
they were like, I'm like, A, did you ever hear about it?

726
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,440
No, it's not saturated.

727
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,240
I'm like, but B, I'm like, does that make sense to you?

728
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,240
They're like, yeah, that actually makes a lot of sense.

729
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:09,520
So then fast forward, then, you know, I just got to the point where

730
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,240
I knew this was no matter what, it was going to work.

731
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,120
I didn't know how.

732
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,760
It's like a combination of the same, you know, it's like squid games.

733
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,560
Like, you know, like you don't know which combination is going to work.

734
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,600
I just knew it was going to work.

735
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,520
I didn't know how long it was going to take.

736
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,360
It was a matter of if, it was a matter of when.

737
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,720
Yeah, yeah, I like that a lot.

738
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:32,720
For me, in 2020, 2019, I was still doing the business.

739
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,720
I was having mediocre success.

740
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,360
I was still doing it the old fashioned way, the right then rent.

741
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:41,040
And, but in the back of my mind, it was still,

742
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,200
I was kind of like looking for like,

743
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,680
if there was a better opportunity, I was ready to jump.

744
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,320
You were a lurker.

745
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,520
You were lurking around.

746
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,520
I was a lurker, a dabbler.

747
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,480
I was half pregnant.

748
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,720
Peeping Tom, Peeping Nick, Peeping Nick.

749
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,160
I was, I had the wandering eye, right?

750
00:30:56,160 --> 00:31:02,160
And finally in 2020, I was like, okay, I, you know,

751
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,440
I've got to take care of my family.

752
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,120
I've got to, I'm getting, I thought I'd be a millionaire at 30

753
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,560
and it's, I'm 29 and anyway, I started writing down.

754
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,800
I'm like, okay, I need to make this kind of money.

755
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:16,880
And I realized I had the right business model, like right inside my, in my hands.

756
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,520
I realized that there was a couple of things that I felt like were broken.

757
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,280
For example, having to wait six months on stuff.

758
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,560
But I knew the model was right.

759
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:27,200
And I just, I made up my mind and I was like, I'm going to do this mentally.

760
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,040
I'm going to do this until it works.

761
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,400
Like, I don't care if that's 10 years.

762
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,000
I don't care if that's 15 years.

763
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,960
I'm done.

764
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,520
Basically I married the model, done and done.

765
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,160
I was no longer dating and I didn't have any side chicks.

766
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,760
It was like, I married the model.

767
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,320
And as soon as I did that eight months later, I was making a hundred grand a month.

768
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,840
Now it wasn't overnight.

769
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,440
I worked my butt off.

770
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,480
I did the pre-selling.

771
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,640
I made this mistake and that mistake.

772
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,640
But to your point, which I've heard you say a couple of times,

773
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,560
and I want to make sure everyone understands is like, that's it.

774
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,320
As soon as you decide, hey, this is it.

775
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,440
This is what I'm going to make work.

776
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:00,960
Imagine Stephanie and Porter, if there was either nine to five,

777
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,560
whatever nine to five you wanted.

778
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,920
And then there was this.

779
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,360
There was no drop shipping.

780
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,720
There was no Etsy shop.

781
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,920
There was no FBA.

782
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,600
Do you know how many more people would be successful at this?

783
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,120
Because it would be the only option.

784
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:12,640
Right?

785
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,200
But the problem-

786
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:13,760
You want to kick your butt?

787
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,960
Yeah, you want to kick your butt in gear?

788
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,720
Like, like, like anytime.

789
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,480
Like I'm not, look, I'm never going back nine up.

790
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,240
Like, I mean, it's not for me.

791
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,400
But once in a blue moon, I have to get in my car and go travel.

792
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,840
Like, and then I'm stuck in rush hour traffic and I'm like, oh, you know,

793
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:31,440
like just being stuck in my car, like in that rat race, you know,

794
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,240
whatever you hate about it.

795
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,320
You're like, look, I don't hate Mondays anymore.

796
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,960
You know, like it's been a long time since I hated Mondays.

797
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,280
But I mean, you know, no more hating Mondays,

798
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:43,280
no more dealing with some boss who's an idiot that knows less than you.

799
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,920
You know, it's like no more times are you going to get told like,

800
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,560
oh, by the way, we're going to have your quarterly review.

801
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:55,200
Look, by the way, like when I, when I got hired for that job that I was doing,

802
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:01,280
for that nonprofit, my supervisor that was interviewing me told me six months later.

803
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:07,200
So six months after I got the job, we were at the Christmas party

804
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,160
and she pulled me aside and she's like, Stephanie, I have something to tell you.

805
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,840
I'm like, what's that Christie?

806
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,920
She's like, when I was interviewing you,

807
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:18,000
I almost didn't extend you an offer and hire you.

808
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:18,800
And I'm like, why is that?

809
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,360
She goes, I was afraid of you.

810
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,160
And I'm like, why is that?

811
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:26,160
She's like, because I figured like you'd have my job in three months.

812
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,880
And I'm like, well, I didn't want your job.

813
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,000
But yeah, thanks for the compliment.

814
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:32,720
I was over.

815
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,520
I wasn't qualified.

816
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:36,640
And I did have to like, I had a downplay because I was,

817
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,840
because I had a headhunting background.

818
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,720
I knew how to like sell myself to get the job, which I did have to downplay.

819
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,360
But from the day I started that job, Nick,

820
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,960
I knew I was either getting fired or I was going to get promoted.

821
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,360
And there was actually one job I wanted,

822
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,360
and it was going to be online and office based.

823
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,520
And they only wanted me in the field.

824
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,880
And I was like, not going to happen.

825
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,800
So I was like, bye.

826
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:07,120
But yeah, I look like years ago, I used to have this like,

827
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,360
I was doing like, my friends were like, you got to do a blog,

828
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,040
you got to do a blog, you got to do Instagram, you got to do this,

829
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,400
whatever social media, blah, blah, blah.

830
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:15,040
And I'm like, okay, mine's called be the driver of your own car.

831
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:18,240
Like, for those, because in my life, there have been times

832
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,560
where like, my sister called me on it, friends have called me out.

833
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,840
They're like, you're just going about your life.

834
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,440
Like, they're like, when are you going to have kids?

835
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,800
I'm like, I don't know when it happens.

836
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,160
They're like, you got to make that decision.

837
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,160
Like, look, I mean, this is years ago.

838
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:33,040
But I realized I had a, like, it was a shock of reality.

839
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:38,640
I was literally, my life was occurring and life was happening to me

840
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:41,440
rather than me grabbing like the steering wheel of my life

841
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,120
and freaking driving my life.

842
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,560
I realized I was in the back seat.

843
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,440
I realized I needed to get in the freaking front seat

844
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,680
and make my own decisions and my own choices.

845
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:53,040
And that's what this business, you know, allows anybody to do

846
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,480
because you can call your own shots.

847
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,560
You can make as much money or as little money as you want.

848
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,080
You can do it full-time, you can do it part-time.

849
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,640
I mean, look at Ryan Dalton, you know, like, look, he's killing it.

850
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,280
You know, he's still working full-time and he, you know, any, and then he,

851
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,680
and then he ramped up, he developed that whole platform.

852
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,920
And he's like, you know, he's on, he's supercharged and other people are,

853
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,560
you know, I know you have other people who are stay at home moms

854
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,880
who've been in it and they're doing very well.

855
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,280
And then, you know, you have, you have the entire continuum.

856
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:21,920
There's no wrong way to do this business model except quitting.

857
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,280
Yeah, very, very true.

858
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,040
I want to ask both of you this.

859
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,040
I'll start with Porter and then Stephanie.

860
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:33,840
But what is one thing and I want you to think about the real answer.

861
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,680
And don't just give me something that comes.

862
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,720
I mean, maybe something comes to your head,

863
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,720
but try to think about the main thing.

864
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:43,440
But what is the one thing that you can blame on your success?

865
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,800
Porter getting to 10-6, Stephanie getting to 8-6.

866
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,760
Porter, I'll have you go first.

867
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,800
What do you think is the number one thing that you can blame your success on?

868
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,680
And by the way, it's okay to pause because if you've ever seen

869
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,760
some of these guys, Elon Musk, wait to give an answer.

870
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,520
He has a pause that's awkward enough.

871
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,760
You almost think there's a glitch on the YouTube video.

872
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,120
So take your time and Stephanie, if you want to go,

873
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,640
if you have an answer already, you can go first.

874
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:13,940
Okay.

875
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,800
It goes back to what I was mentioning before.

876
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,360
It's just there is no other option.

877
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,480
There's no fork in the road.

878
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,680
It's not a matter of if, it's just a matter of how.

879
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,360
It's that constant belief.

880
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:35,760
And I'll tell you, I don't know how I'm going to get there,

881
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,520
but I'm going to freaking get there.

882
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:42,480
And again, it's like, don't be afraid to try anything.

883
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,240
Whatever you need.

884
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:48,800
And I'll tell you, I realized that I was, I have, look,

885
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,640
I have some very negative people in my family.

886
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,680
They're my parents.

887
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,400
And so I had to pull back from spending time with them.

888
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,720
And I had to stop and I had to stop talking to people

889
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,880
that don't understand the rank and rent business

890
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,640
because it's very easy for them to go, oh,

891
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,800
you've been in it for six months and you haven't made any money.

892
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,360
Oh, you invested how much money?

893
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,640
Oh, and you went down to New Orleans.

894
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,920
Oh, and you bought how many websites?

895
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,280
Oh, you know, like, I mean,

896
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,160
I can go on and on and on.

897
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,800
I'm like, dude, I don't need more negative Nellies.

898
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,160
I don't need that in my life.

899
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,480
I'm like, dude, check yourself at the door

900
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,760
so that I just zip my mouth.

901
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,040
It's like, I mean, I'm a big proponent.

902
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,720
I'm a huge follower of Dan Martell.

903
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,360
I love Hermosy and I love Dan Martell.

904
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,680
I'm telling you, if you want to follow too,

905
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,640
Nick, your stuff's great.

906
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,920
These are generalists, like Hermosy and Martell.

907
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,400
Fabulous.

908
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,440
It's about mindset and about not getting sucked.

909
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,160
It, you know, Martell actually was tap.

910
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,280
He's a Canadian guy.

911
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,240
And, you know, look him up, if you guys,

912
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,640
if you don't know him, but amazing guy.

913
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,520
And it was X number of years ago, he started making it big.

914
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,920
He wrote a whole bunch of SaaS programs

915
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,120
and this and that started killing it.

916
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,200
Like he was doing stuff in Canada.

917
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,040
And then one day he gets a call

918
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:05,520
and Richard Brinson wanted him to come to his villa in Switzerland.

919
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,240
And Martell was looking around like, who me?

920
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,120
And next thing you know, Martell goes over to Switzerland

921
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,080
with like nine other guys

922
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,600
and they're hanging out with Sir Richard Branson.

923
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,160
And he's, you know, he's having like all this imposter syndrome,

924
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:21,280
you know, feeling like he's not worthy of being there.

925
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,040
But he, I think it goes back to playing up

926
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,760
and surrounding yourself with the people.

927
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,640
And Porter, you made a great point about that earlier.

928
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,680
It's about being around other people who are succeeding.

929
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,840
You know, you have to play up in terms of like

930
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,000
being around other guys or women

931
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,680
that are doing better than you are.

932
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,000
And not being around the people who are going to suck you down.

933
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:48,080
It's very easy when someone is at their job

934
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,960
and they're sour grapes and they hate their life,

935
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,400
it's really easy for them to like poke a hole in what we're doing.

936
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,720
Even if we have a modicum of success

937
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:00,240
because it's natural human tendency that they have that

938
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,200
it's not that those are bad people.

939
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,280
It's just like, you know, when Britney Spears,

940
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,840
like, you know, like has problems on the news

941
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,520
or Janet Jackson flashes her boob or whatever,

942
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,600
like all of a sudden, like, oh, people love scandal.

943
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,680
People in general want to, like they want to hate on other people

944
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,360
because they don't feel good about themselves.

945
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:22,320
And so I had to make sure that I kept all that negative stuff out

946
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:29,520
and I would listen to YouTube videos every night, just audio.

947
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:34,080
I would stick it underneath my pillow of positive mindset stuff.

948
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,000
And related to money.

949
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,000
So like you guys can YouTube,

950
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,920
but like, I mean, there's YouTube videos for everything,

951
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,800
but it's just audio.

952
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,640
It's, you know, it's not, it's nothing visual.

953
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:47,200
It's just about, it's really about the positive, the auto suggestion.

954
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:51,840
And literally whatever you think about will come about.

955
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,960
And if you're worried, it's the, it's the power of,

956
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,400
it's the mindset of abundancy versus the mindset of scarcity.

957
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,040
And I will tell you one last thing.

958
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,960
A year ago, like after I stopped working at that nonprofit,

959
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,080
like I took like six or nine months off and I wasn't making any money.

960
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,400
So like, just for like, just for like kicks and giggles,

961
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,600
I started selling plasma.

962
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,960
And I'd be like in the plasma selling thing,

963
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,960
like they're like looking around, like going like,

964
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,160
like I'd be there in the middle of the day.

965
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,560
And I'm like looking around and you can tell, you just tell these people,

966
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,560
like most of these people don't have jobs.

967
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:26,320
And I'm like, and all of a sudden I went one day, I'm like, what Stephanie,

968
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,440
I'm like, what the hell are you doing?

969
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,600
Frickin stop selling plasma.

970
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,320
Like you, you got to get out of this like negative,

971
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:36,480
like you're like a poor broke, you know, person you've sell plasma.

972
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,480
And like, like, could I have used the money?

973
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,360
Yeah, because I was reading my say, like my, you know,

974
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:44,240
we talk about leaky buckets, you know, like, like my bucket was leaking a lot

975
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,680
because I didn't have anything going in the bucket.

976
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,840
It was leaking because I was investing in this business.

977
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,320
But I said, look, I said, I had to pull the plug.

978
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:53,040
I'm like, I like, you know, because 50 bucks here, 100 bucks there.

979
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,080
That was great.

980
00:40:54,160 --> 00:41:00,800
But it was conceptually, I needed to stop that negative scarcity mindset

981
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:05,360
and go full in to be around people like you, Porter and you, Nick,

982
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:08,000
and everybody else in your group to be like around people

983
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,680
and thinking like, I'm going to crush it.

984
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,200
They're crushing it. There's no reason I can't.

985
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,800
I love that. So yeah, I agree making the decision.

986
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,720
There's no other option. It sounds cliche, but it's a huge thing.

987
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,720
That's burn the bridge, burn the bridge,

988
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,920
burn the ship there, all the different ways of saying it's very, very true.

989
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:26,720
Porter, what about you?

990
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:33,200
I would say at the beginning, I think when people would post their deals,

991
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,040
it would kind of make me mad. I would be like, gosh dang,

992
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:38,640
like this person's landing deals and I've been in this how much longer

993
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:42,960
or I have more resources. Like it was almost a chip on my shoulder.

994
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,200
And I remember one time I was doing some 10 K coaching.

995
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,720
I remember one guy was like, how is he supposed to, you know, coach me

996
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,760
on if he's not even at 10 K. And so a part of it was just like proving

997
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,680
other people wrong, which is probably the bad way to do it.

998
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:57,200
But just like, Hey, I'm from a small town. I'm a farmer.

999
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:01,200
Like I can, I can do just as good as someone that has this much knowledge.

1000
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:05,200
You know, so I think a lot of it has to do with like the chip on my shoulder.

1001
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:08,560
But I also would say just the people that I'm around, like I didn't even

1002
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:12,080
believe that there was that much money to be made until I was in this group.

1003
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:16,000
And I was like, Oh my gosh, like I'm, I'm this little fish in this big world.

1004
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,920
And like, why, why shouldn't I work harder? Like if I work harder, I can achieve that.

1005
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,160
So that's what kind of drove me.

1006
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,960
And that's what it continues to drive me is just seeing other people's success

1007
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,600
and like, why not me? Yeah, I love that.

1008
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:32,400
It's true guys. And that's, that's, that's a great thing about this group.

1009
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,640
There's some really, really successful people in, and by the way, that's a great,

1010
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:40,400
thanks for your answer, but in this group, not only in, in the rank and rent,

1011
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,800
but like one thing I've noticed I really love about this group is everyone's from,

1012
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:48,400
like comes this group already being really successful in the thing that they were doing,

1013
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:52,640
just knowing or realizing at some point that it's not the avenue and the vehicle

1014
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:55,040
they want to use because they want freedom and they want to have, you know,

1015
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,960
time freedom, location freedom, financial freedom.

1016
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:02,160
So make sure you guys are, you know, what I, one thing I would say in groups like this,

1017
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:08,560
I have my own groups, I've been in groups, but if you will be somebody that's always looking

1018
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:13,440
to add value and be a producer, not a consumer, not just one of these leeches, not one of these

1019
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:18,240
freaking just try to suck as much information and hide in the shadows, but you're actually out there

1020
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:23,360
if you learn something, you post about it. If you get a win, you post about it. If you get a loss,

1021
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:28,720
you post about it. You're making connections. You're involved running an online business is

1022
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:34,720
very, very lonely at times. And guys, I don't know, five, six years ago, I finally made up my mind.

1023
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:39,280
I started in these groups and I was very scarcity mentality. Like Stephanie was talking about,

1024
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,880
I didn't want anybody to know who I was. Didn't want anyone to steal my niches. I didn't want

1025
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:50,800
to be on anyone's radar. And then in 2018, 2019, I started posting, sharing my journey,

1026
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:57,200
sharing my wins, sharing my losses. And guys, from these groups, I've made two business partnerships.

1027
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,880
I've made a joint venture. I make over a hundred thousand dollars a year from,

1028
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:06,160
and I've made some really, really good friends. So, but just understand you guys are in a group

1029
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:12,320
of people. It's like we got in the world and we've attracted all the people into this group,

1030
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:17,440
my group, people that want more highly driven people, people that aren't satisfied with just,

1031
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:22,400
you know, their everyday life. So really good point there. All right, guys, let's do this as

1032
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:26,480
we wrap up. I know we've been going for a while here. Does anybody want to spend just a few

1033
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:31,440
minutes? No more than just five, six minutes. If there's any questions, does anybody have any

1034
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:40,080
questions they want to ask Stephanie Porter on the topic of reselling, getting deals, getting to,

1035
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:46,720
you know, but basically a six figure per month or six figure per year

1036
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:52,800
amount, because, you know, 8,600 times up by 12, you're over the hundred thousand Porter,

1037
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:58,400
the same with you. Does anybody have any questions that they want to ask? I'll give just like a

1038
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:03,920
minute. If nobody does, we'll end the stream. And I have one last question I'm going to ask

1039
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:08,320
both of these guys to end. So let me just see before I ask this question, if there is anybody

1040
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:13,440
with any questions. Okay, so I'll keep my eye on this. Let me ask this question.

1041
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:18,640
And then if there's nothing, we'll just end this. So my question for both of you,

1042
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:24,640
let's start with Stephanie. Do you think everybody should pre-sell or is that only

1043
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:32,320
for a certain type of person? And if so, who? I think everybody should pre-sell because

1044
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:37,120
look, even if you do organic, you still have to get on the phone with the business owner.

1045
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:47,040
I mean, there's no reason not to pre-sell. I mean, there's really no reason not to pre-sell.

1046
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,760
Hey, you're preaching to the choir. You're preaching to the choir, don't you? You don't

1047
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:59,040
got to convince me. Unless you, you know, you just don't want to help Google or Facebook or,

1048
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:03,520
you know, any of these large companies. But, you know, I mean, there's really no reason not to.

1049
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:08,240
Yeah. There's a look, there's a learning click. For those of you who are like,

1050
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:13,520
there is a learning curve in learning how to run these ads. I mean, it is not, it's not a

1051
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:17,920
bitty cracker cook like cake. Like it's not like this little mic box, you know, this little box

1052
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:22,560
and you pour water and add, you know, like add one egg or whatever. It's not that easy, you know,

1053
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:27,680
but, but, but, but Nick, you know, Nick has people on staff that walk you through it and help you.

1054
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:32,160
And, and then there's some new tools that are available that make it much easier than back in

1055
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:36,800
the stone ages when Nick started this and had to do it all by hand. And, and, you know, so it's

1056
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:43,920
much easier now. And so, and by the way, the one thing I was worried about, not that I didn't want

1057
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:49,200
to tell my story, but when I first started to, went to now, but I think it's real common. People

1058
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:54,480
are worried that, that this industry is saturated because they see new people coming online and this

1059
00:46:54,480 --> 00:47:00,640
and that guys, there is so much fricking business out there. It's, it's like ridiculous. Like,

1060
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:06,000
and even in the most like saturated niches, like, I mean, you know, it's, it's, there's so

1061
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,880
much business. I mean, it's, it's, and every day new businesses are opening up. And like, I mean,

1062
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:20,080
I shouldn't even say this, but I will. So like, I won't tell you which one it is, but I, I'm running

1063
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:25,680
ads and, and I'm in, I'm in a market and in the same niche that's in one of Nick's trading videos.

1064
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:33,200
I'll let you figure it out, Nick. That just shows like, like that shows, but the point is like that,

1065
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:36,720
that even there, like, I knew there's more room and like, so you, you don't know, you probably

1066
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:40,320
didn't know that because like, there's so much room, like there's so much business, like, I'm sure,

1067
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:43,360
like, I'm sure, you know, you're, you still have your business owner and then like, I found another

1068
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:47,120
business owner and I, you know, and so there's just so much room for opportunity.

1069
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:52,880
Yeah, a hundred percent. Like I've, I, it's funny because as, as I started training this

1070
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:56,640
I, it's funny because as, as I started training this, I started talking about, I've actually

1071
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:00,000
that happened more than once. I'll, I'll be looking at rankings or whatever. I'm like, oh,

1072
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,000
there's somebody that's coming in. And by the way, it doesn't make me mad zero. Cause I'm like,

1073
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,880
Hey, I can work with a business owner. You can work with a business owner and everybody can win

1074
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:12,080
because as long as we're kicking out all the other guys and then it doesn't matter. So,

1075
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:15,680
okay, Porter, what about you? Do you just, you don't have to, you don't have to agree or disagree,

1076
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:21,200
but do you think everybody should presale? I think so. And I do think that she've always used

1077
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:26,880
this, but like, it's just another tool that you can use. I think the best thing about this is

1078
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:32,080
no matter what you, you go into and you're doing your due diligence, you could look at two options.

1079
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:35,840
You either presale, which it could be your first option. And then if it's too competitive to run

1080
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:40,800
ads, you could organically rank and have those going. So I just love the fact that like you can

1081
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:45,440
be doing both. There's a happy medium to both of these, but like, as far as like personalities

1082
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:50,800
for pre-selling, I think anyone can do that. It doesn't matter where you come from. It's just

1083
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:56,000
if there's a process in place, I mean, like I said, the way that you present it,

1084
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,400
you're basically selling it before you're actually selling it. So I think it's a lot more about the

1085
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:06,400
setup than, as you mentioned, the sell. Yeah. I think it's like this guys. I think that even

1086
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:10,560
if you are having a strictly organic strategy, you should have one or two projects. You should

1087
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:16,000
be trying to get one, a deal at all times running some simple ads that can speed it up. There's no

1088
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,920
reason. You could have 90% of your strategy being organic, but there's no reason you shouldn't be

1089
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:25,360
running ads and getting deals up front. It's okay. It diversifies your portfolio. Yeah,

1090
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:28,720
a hundred percent. And the other thing I would just really quick mention, and then we'll wrap

1091
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:34,960
this up is I give this strategy, I talk about ads, I talk about, hey, we're going to run ads

1092
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:39,760
up front to a landing page, but you have to understand that you got to pay the piper or

1093
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:43,440
you got to pay somebody that's paid the piper because like, I'll give you this really quick

1094
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:46,960
example. I jumped on the phone with somebody. This is not from this group, by the way,

1095
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:50,720
jumped on the phone with somebody with Kyle about two weeks ago, three weeks ago,

1096
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:55,760
and this person was interested. They're in another group, not this one. They're not having the

1097
00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:00,240
success that they want. It's not going fast enough, whatever. They want to run ads, blah, blah, blah.

1098
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:04,240
They don't know how to run ads. And they're like, let me get on. So they get on, they look at what

1099
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:08,560
it's like to work with me and what that looks like as far as a commitment and stuff. And anyway,

1100
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:14,000
long story short, they don't end up coming into the group. And I got a text today from this person

1101
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,080
and said, Hey, I just want to say, I appreciate you. You give so much value in your YouTube

1102
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:22,160
videos, blah, blah, blah. I actually feel like I'm in a pretty good spot. I went and bought a

1103
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:32,720
Udemy course on ads. And I think I'm going to be good. And I just took my phone and I was like,

1104
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:37,520
Hey, I don't want this to come across. So I did a voice note. I said, you're trying to do a

1105
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:42,800
shortcut here, bro. If the person that's on the, if the person actually spent a million,

1106
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:46,560
$1.5 million on ads like I did, and they actually know what they're doing, they're going to be

1107
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:50,480
selling a Udemy course for 15 bucks. I'm just telling you that right now. So you could keep

1108
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:54,080
going down the path. I've seen it a hundred times. You can go spin up some ads, waste a couple of

1109
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:58,640
thousand bucks, three months of your life, and we'll have the same conversation, or I can help

1110
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:05,040
you right now. So I say that because I love when people take action. I love when people get going,

1111
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:10,000
but realize that you either have to learn it over the course of four years and a $1.5 million,

1112
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,440
or you have to take it and you have to learn it from somebody that's done it. And I promise

1113
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:18,800
you, there's a lot of sharks out there. There's a lot of wolf in sheep's clothing, as they say

1114
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:22,240
in the Bible. And there's a lot of people that I know, and you guys know personally that are

1115
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:28,080
teaching this that aren't making jack shit on their own agency or never have. So the first thing,

1116
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:33,280
if you want to go to any training, I would go ahead and ask them, what have you made? Can you

1117
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:37,200
show me your Stripe account and tax returns? And what are you making right now? Because I promise

1118
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:42,000
you, it's going to eliminate 99.9% of people. Okay. That said, guys, I don't see any-

1119
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,480
Well, I want to clarify one thing. I just want to say this. So even though I said that I'm in one

1120
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:52,400
of your own markets, I do want to clarify because it's realized in that market, I'm running Facebook

1121
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:57,280
ads. So I'm swimming in a different pond. And even if you were running Google ads, Stephanie,

1122
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:01,760
I don't- Yeah, but no, but that's the other thing. I just want to show there's so many different ways

1123
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:06,560
you can slice and dice, so many different permutations and everything. Yeah. So I mean,

1124
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:10,320
there's so much business out there. So- Yeah. I have no worries at all. So-

1125
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:13,680
You got to DM me and see if you can guess what market it is.

1126
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:19,680
Okay. I'll DM me and they're like, hey, guess. And I'll shoot a guess. I think I've got a good guess

1127
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:22,720
because I've seen two different ones. So I'll guess.

1128
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:23,600
Really?

1129
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:28,000
Yeah. But maybe they're not both yours, obviously just one of them. But anyway, guys, appreciate

1130
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:33,120
you being on, appreciate Stephanie, appreciate Porter. If you guys do want to learn more about

1131
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:37,360
pre-selling, I have a YouTube channel, which a lot of Stephanie said, I think I have 2.1,000

1132
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:42,400
videos, just YouTube, my name, Nick Wood and RankinRet. We also, I have a free training

1133
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:46,640
if you go to rentsimplesights.com. In fact, Porter, while you're holding the baby, dude,

1134
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:50,880
hold on, freaking Porter. Stephanie, type that in the chat for me, rentsimplesights.com.

1135
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:55,200
You can go see blonde Nick, brown haired Nick. You can go see-

1136
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:58,160
Yeah, no, rentsimplesights, that one is brown haired Nick, don't worry.

1137
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:03,760
And also different lengths too. Sometimes it's short, sometimes it's really long.

1138
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,360
The Africa, Nick, you can see.

1139
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:10,960
Yeah, you got everything. You got everything. And then I'm going to drop one more link after

1140
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:16,800
you do that. About three weeks ago, some of you guys know I used to have a free Facebook

1141
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:20,800
group where we would cover any and everything related to pre-selling and this and that and the

1142
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:26,480
rest. And we got to this point where it just kind of got watered down with a bunch of looky-loo

1143
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:31,680
tire kickers. So we actually moved the group over to school. So I'll drop that. It's now called

1144
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:36,160
the RankinRet Academy. I'll drop a link to that. Don't feel like it's anything that you have to

1145
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:39,520
do, but it's just something that you can check out. So there's some links for you guys. It looks

1146
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:45,760
like Kevin said, hey, what's up, Nick, Porter, and Steph, cool. Yeah, by the way, Kevin says,

1147
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:53,200
cool VA. So Ford's the VA now. I love it. Anyway, check out those links. Check out those links.

1148
00:53:55,440 --> 00:54:00,480
You know what I forgot to do, Porter? Me and Porter talked about this because he works with

1149
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:06,240
me a little bit. I actually, inside of my group, I actually paid Porter to help out my students

1150
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:10,320
where if they have a question, they can literally jump on a call. So let's do the same thing in

1151
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:13,280
this group. What's your phone number? Let's give them your cell phone number.

1152
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:25,520
So it's 435-393-5694. If you guys have a question, that's Porter's actual cell.

1153
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:34,400
Text Porter, call Porter, preferably text him and he'll be driving a tractor, doing his thing.

1154
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:38,320
And when he has like little 30 minute breaks, he'll jump on phone calls with people and help

1155
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:41,680
them out. So are you cool doing that with people in this group if they want? Yeah, that's totally

1156
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:49,760
cool. You have to message me anytime. Awesome. Are you on Snapchat, Porter? Snapchat, whatever.

1157
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:56,080
You're going to get a lot of tractor Snapchat videos on that. Also, Stephanie, I do want to ask

1158
00:54:56,080 --> 00:55:05,840
one last question. What are you going to be at by December 31st? December 31st, what's MRR going to

1159
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:13,520
be at? 56. Okay, let's go. We're going to hold you to that. Okay, guys. Appreciate you being on.

1160
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:21,680
We'll see you next time. Thanks, guys.
