1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
Okay, so I'm just going to cover, by the way, welcome to the call once again.

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:11,720
If you are brand new to this group and it's your first call, welcome to Digital Landlords

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:16,360
Live, which we're going to be doing every single bloody week.

4
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,720
Yeah, every week, every Tuesday, 7 a.m.

5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,720
MST.

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,440
I understand it's not the most convenient time.

7
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,480
By the way, if you guys can hear me, please let me know.

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,680
I have my mic plugged in and sometimes it does a little funny business.

9
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,840
So anyway, if you're brand new to this group, you're going to see me going live every single

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,840
week.

11
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:42,600
I think over the course of almost three years now, there's only been two times that I haven't

12
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,600
been live and I got stuck in the bush.

13
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:51,040
And I literally was planning on being back at my hotel.

14
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,560
I was in Africa and I just couldn't do it.

15
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,080
Every other situation, it's either me or I've got somebody live.

16
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:01,240
And I think in those situations, I still put up a replay or gave you guys something.

17
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:05,480
So make sure to set your calendars every single Tuesday, 7 a.m.

18
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,320
You will see me going live, OK?

19
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:12,280
Real quick, the only thing that I want to cover is I guess maybe two things.

20
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:18,120
Number one is if you didn't catch, was it last week or the week before?

21
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,480
Maybe it was a couple of weeks ago.

22
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:24,080
But if you did not catch the live I did with Ryan Dalton, you guys need to go check that

23
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,080
out.

24
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,360
Find that really quick.

25
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:33,840
Guys, if you haven't been messing around, playing around with the tool, the rank and

26
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:41,960
rent engine tool, this thing is making business so much easier than when I was coming up.

27
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,920
Let me go ahead and find that real quick.

28
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,160
I'm going to lose my train of thought.

29
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,600
Where the heck is that live?

30
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,560
I know it's got to be right here at the top.

31
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,280
Let me just scroll just a tiny bit.

32
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,280
Where the heck is it at?

33
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,280
Search it.

34
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,280
Hold on.

35
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,640
Oh, that's weird.

36
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,440
That's weird because that thing got a lot of views.

37
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,440
Hold on.

38
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,880
Give me a sec.

39
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,800
I want to just share this live in the chat.

40
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,360
OK, I'm going to search it.

41
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,360
Hold on.

42
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,360
One sec.

43
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,360
Tool.

44
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:16,240
OK, there it is.

45
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,240
Hold on.

46
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,240
Got it.

47
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,240
And boom.

48
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,240
OK.

49
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:26,080
If you guys have not watched this, check this out.

50
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,840
By the way, Stephanie, what's going on?

51
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,480
That's the only other person I saw that looks new from what I was saying before.

52
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,480
OK.

53
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,440
If you guys didn't watch that, I'll try to even pin that.

54
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,600
That is such a good live.

55
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:46,520
Just real quick in a nutshell, guys, Ryan Dalton has built this very cool tool that

56
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:55,480
has basically taken everything that you need to build and scale your rank and rent agency.

57
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,640
And he's put it into a tool.

58
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,540
Go to rankandrentengine.com.

59
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:04,000
If anyone remembers the exact code, I think it's Ignition24.

60
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
All caps.

61
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm going to type that.

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,840
I think that's what it is.

63
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,120
Ignition24, I think.

64
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,600
And what that's going to allow you guys to do.

65
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,120
It's a beta discount.

66
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:25,560
So we're in the week, basically the beginning of week three of beta for that software.

67
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,920
Now I've been through it.

68
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,160
I spent time almost every day.

69
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:34,400
Yesterday, I spent about 30, 35 minutes doing more due diligence.

70
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,360
And man, that's not perfect.

71
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,820
We're going to be giving him feedback.

72
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,560
We're going to be making changes, whatever.

73
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:47,120
The thing that I love about it is with some of these other tools, the SEMrush, the Mangles,

74
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,480
whatever, we don't have control over it because it's just a tool that somebody else owns.

75
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,640
And with this one, like real time, we can give Ryan feedback and say, hey, what about

76
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,640
this feature?

77
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,640
What about this feature?

78
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,640
What about this feature?

79
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,600
And it's made for rank and rent.

80
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:05,440
There's other tools that people use for rank and rent, like high level and lead snap and

81
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,440
stuff like that.

82
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:12,840
Also, they built it for a wider platform in an effort to attract more people, which is

83
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,840
fine.

84
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:20,040
However, I think they did it wrong because this was built specifically for rank and rent

85
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,560
and rank and rent only.

86
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,960
And so if you are in rank and rent, it makes total sense.

87
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,760
So anyway, guys, no pressure, but I am telling you, you can, in fact, you know what I should

88
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,960
do really quick?

89
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,600
Is there a way I can show you without giving away my secrets?

90
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,600
Hold on.

91
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,800
Let me see if I open this up, if it's going to just show you my entire freaking whatever.

92
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,480
I don't know if I can do that.

93
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:52,160
I don't know if I can do that.

94
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,160
Let's see.

95
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,520
Yeah, I'll just do it anyway.

96
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,520
Let me just do this really quick.

97
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,040
I'm going to show you guys two seconds and we're going to get going on this call.

98
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,040
One second.

99
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,040
Okay.

100
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,040
Ready?

101
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,040
Okay.

102
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,840
Hopefully you guys can see my screen.

103
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,520
I just want to show you guys really quick.

104
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,280
So go rankandrentengine.com, but it's literally this dope tool.

105
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:20,440
You've got the task tracker, which is like, guys, I was paying for this software.

106
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,440
Let's see.

107
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,440
What software was I using?

108
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,440
Kind of like this.

109
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,240
This is a software we were using kind of like, what's that?

110
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,480
I can't even remember what it's called.

111
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,840
It's the one where you just move stuff around, not air table, something else.

112
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,880
Anyway, I was paid for a software that basically did this.

113
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,440
You could just drag your tasks like this.

114
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:42,640
I think it might've been Pipe Drive, but Francesca's put all these in and yeah, you could just

115
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,880
track all your tasks you need to do inside your agency.

116
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,960
So we've been messing around with that a bit.

117
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,840
You've got your due diligence, which is dope.

118
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,480
You can really crank out due diligence.

119
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:57,360
I used to spend an hour per due diligence to really look at a city and now I can pipe

120
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:02,880
everything in and I'm able to knock out a due diligence in like less than 12 minutes.

121
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,200
And I think I can get that down to about seven minutes once I really get the hang of this,

122
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,200
which is incredible.

123
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,840
It literally computes the data like that.

124
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,000
Then you have your site portfolio.

125
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,780
You can keep track of all your sites.

126
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:20,040
You got your prospecting pipeline and there's literally a software called Pipe Drive that

127
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:25,200
this does the same thing as you've got your client list, all your leads, all your calls.

128
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,520
You can buy your tracking numbers.

129
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,840
You can analyze a site, which is the same thing that SEMrush does.

130
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,720
You get your keyword planner and this is version one.

131
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,640
So I'm getting pretty pumped about this.

132
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:43,040
Our goal as an agency, and I don't know if you guys saw this post by Francesca.

133
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:50,880
We did an estimate on Thursday of last week and I say Francesca did it.

134
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,440
We gave them an option of $7,500 or $10,000 per month.

135
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,440
That was their two options.

136
00:06:55,640 --> 00:07:01,080
Now we may not even get the deal at all, but those are the type of deals that get me juiced

137
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,080
up, get me excited.

138
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,680
Those are the ones I'll get involved in.

139
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:11,320
If it's 10 grand a month, I'll show up to a call, but I'm not even including that.

140
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:19,040
Our goal is to add, by December 1st, to add an extra $10,000 per month to our agency.

141
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,160
Not to my digital landlords program, whatever.

142
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,160
We're going to keep growing this.

143
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,920
I'm going to keep focusing on this.

144
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,440
We've got a ton of stuff.

145
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,520
We're working on version 3.0.

146
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,680
We're working on new ad stuff, a bunch of stuff.

147
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:36,120
But just the agency alone, we're going to add an extra $10,000 in the next 45 days.

148
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,200
Mark my words.

149
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,680
And this tool is making it very, very easy.

150
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,000
So anyway, guys, I'm stoked about this.

151
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,520
I've been playing around a lot with this.

152
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,720
And this has taken the Google Sheet, the Airtable, the Pipe Drive, the Google Doc,

153
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,680
the SEMrush, the Mangools, the keyword planner, and you've got one tool that's

154
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,680
focused on rank and rent.

155
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,560
So if you guys haven't already, go play around with this thing.

156
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,560
There's a free version.

157
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:02,960
But if you use that Ignition 24, then it's 20% off for the first couple of months.

158
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,320
And that's part of the beta.

159
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,760
And we want the feedback and everything else so we can make this as good as possible.

160
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,120
But shout out to Ryan Dalton.

161
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,440
Great job, my friend.

162
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,240
Okay.

163
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:16,240
That said, guys, let me give a little preface to this call and let's do it.

164
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,800
Let me just get back to my screen.

165
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,240
I lost it.

166
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,040
Hold on.

167
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:22,880
I lost it.

168
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,560
There it is.

169
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:23,920
Okay.

170
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,200
Beautiful.

171
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,160
Okay.

172
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,600
Everyone can still hear me.

173
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,080
What else we got here?

174
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:35,120
We've got Matt Torres.

175
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:35,800
What's up?

176
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,480
And Mr.

177
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,760
Kurt Dahlstrom.

178
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,160
Guys, it's crazy to me.

179
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,200
I love this, by the way.

180
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,360
We've got people from all over the world in this call right now.

181
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,360
Like I just saw Corey and Nick.

182
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,000
Corey and Nicholas are like five minutes from me or 10 minutes from me, which is

183
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,560
awesome.

184
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:56,400
And then we've got on the other extreme, we've got Kurt, who's in China.

185
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,280
He's a resident of China right now.

186
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,600
I think that's what you'd say.

187
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,320
Trying to see if I can recognize anyone else that's in a far flung place.

188
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,440
Some of these people are, some of you guys are in different parts of the states,

189
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,800
but we're all here doing the same thing.

190
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,560
This is the community.

191
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,880
Make sure you guys are in this community every single day.

192
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,000
Make connections.

193
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,560
If you haven't already done your intro post, do it and go find some people that

194
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,480
are in your situation.

195
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,400
You guys can connect.

196
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,640
And like I was saying, Corey and Nicholas, you guys should definitely connect up.

197
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,760
Jahill says, quick question.

198
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,320
What would you say the baseline search volume would?

199
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:27,800
Okay.

200
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,080
That's the question, right?

201
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,680
So Jahill, I think I know what it is because I've been playing around a lot

202
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,440
with this tool.

203
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,800
That's going to be our topic for our live in the next week or two.

204
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:45,160
I know I've been saying that for a while, but I really want to make dang sure

205
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,080
that when I say, Hey, it's 50, then it's 50.

206
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:53,360
But that is one of the beautiful things about having a tool that we can control.

207
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:59,680
As I can confidently say, when the tool says this, you can be 95% sure there's

208
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,480
going to be enough volume.

209
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,520
And I was talking to Corey Gilbert about this yesterday real quick, and then

210
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,400
we'll get into this call.

211
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:10,440
And he was asking me about population and I was telling him, Hey, population

212
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,800
does not matter, which is the truth.

213
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,720
It comes down to search volume.

214
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,680
But generally speaking, the bigger the population, the more search volume

215
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,720
there's going to be generally speaking, right?

216
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,440
Not in every case, but in most cases.

217
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:27,720
Um, but what I would definitely say guys is on your first project, your first five

218
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:32,960
projects, make sure you're not risking, you know, you want to get into usually a

219
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:38,200
smaller city, a smaller population means less competition, but not always.

220
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:38,880
Okay.

221
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:43,640
So you always want to have like the lowest competition, the lowest population

222
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,960
technically, because that means the lower competition, but you've got to make

223
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,200
sure that you're, you're getting enough search volume.

224
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,600
You don't want to go into a city, um, where, you know, you're running ads,

225
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,120
you're, you're, you're ranking on Google and there's just not enough leads.

226
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:58,320
Okay.

227
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,160
That's the worst.

228
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,280
And I've done that before and I've done this in too small of cities.

229
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,640
Um, the search volume has been too low, et cetera.

230
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:08,920
So I would just recommend on your first couple of projects, make sure you guys

231
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:15,520
are being safe about going into a city that has enough search volume and you're

232
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,880
not even worried that you're going to not have enough.

233
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,040
Okay.

234
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:22,200
So I know for example, we're running a deal right now where we have a one pager

235
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,720
in a city in, I think Virginia, and we're having a problem getting leads.

236
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,280
I didn't pick the city, Francesca.

237
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,040
Gosh, dang it.

238
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,520
Francesca picked the city.

239
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:34,080
It was one of those that looked like low hanging fruit, but it was on the

240
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,200
bordering edge of is there going to be enough volume?

241
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,800
And it's looking like there's not.

242
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,760
And so I don't want you guys to make that mistake.

243
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,400
So make sure there's enough volume, uh, on these first deals.

244
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,000
Don't, don't even risk it.

245
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,840
Make sure you're going to have enough search volume.

246
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,280
Okay.

247
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,880
Okay.

248
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,200
That said, and Jahill, I promise you that's not going to be a question that's avoided.

249
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,920
I'm that's why I'm in the tool so much.

250
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,600
Part of the reason I'm checking out the due diligence, I want to know this

251
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,400
thing inside and out backwards and forward.

252
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,920
So if I'm going to endorse something, then I need to know it every part of it.

253
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,560
And I do know that there's a few little holes and tweaks we need to make,

254
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,120
but we want to hear your feedback as well.

255
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,800
So, um, Lynel says, how long do you run ads before it's a volume issue?

256
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:19,320
I know if like, I I'll know it's a volume issue within the first couple of weeks.

257
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,160
Okay.

258
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,960
And, but you have to keep in mind, you have to think about the time of year.

259
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,320
You have to think about, you know, other circumstances.

260
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,920
We've got the election coming up.

261
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,680
We got fricking, we're in the middle of a recession.

262
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,040
People are uncertain.

263
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,080
I've got my business owner right now.

264
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,760
Um, just so you guys know, I have problems too.

265
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,120
I have a business owner that's been with me a long time threatening, not

266
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,520
threatening, but telling me, I don't know, maybe I should just pause till the election.

267
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,600
And we're like, what are you talking about, dude?

268
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,120
What are you freaking talking about?

269
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,880
So there are some weird stuff going on in the world, but we're still pressing for it.

270
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,720
We just made a $10,000 a month offer, right?

271
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,280
So we're still, the companies that are hungry are hungry.

272
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,120
And, uh, that's just the game name of the game.

273
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,520
So hopefully that answers your question.

274
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,320
Um, Daniel Kelly, what does enough volume mean to you?

275
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,360
We're going to cover that.

276
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:11,240
Um, but for now I would, I don't even want to give you, uh, I would just say,

277
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:16,240
make sure that your main keyword, if you want to be safe, safe, safe, safe, safe,

278
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,960
make sure your main keyword on, uh, uh, rank and run engine says at least a hundred.

279
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:22,240
Okay.

280
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,840
That's being very safe.

281
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,320
Okay.

282
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,200
And I don't think it's going to mean to be near that, but if you want me to do

283
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,320
that without having to go in and check the tool very well, which I'm going to,

284
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:37,080
if it says a hundred and the CPC is something less than $5 on, you know, two,

285
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:40,400
three, four of the main keywords, then you probably going to be safe.

286
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:40,840
Okay.

287
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,880
And if you're looking at population, I know population doesn't matter, but it

288
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,040
can be indicative of how competitive it is.

289
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:51,200
Um, you know, a hundred thousand plus to be very safe is going to be work.

290
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,520
Now I've gotten deals in cities with 30,000.

291
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:58,200
Um, so I'm going to try to give you guys the bare minimum search volume.

292
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:02,400
And then you guys can know that anything above that should work, but for, to be

293
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:07,120
safe for a quick answer, that's what I would say real quick.

294
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,840
Adair says people are still spending money though.

295
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,920
I just talked to, I just talked to a concrete guy and said they want, they

296
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,120
start three to five pools a week.

297
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,320
People are still spending money in the, in the right parts of the country, the

298
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,880
right mindsets, like people are still spending money, dude.

299
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,320
That's the, that's a great point.

300
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:22,800
I dare.

301
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,080
Um, okay, guys, let's get in the call.

302
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,920
Uh, today I got a treat for you guys.

303
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,640
I'm going to be bringing on Mr.

304
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,480
Zach Powell.

305
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:37,800
Um, now I want to just preface this and let you guys know that this call, um,

306
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,560
we're going to take an interesting angle with this call.

307
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,720
For those of you that just got in this program, I don't want you to be confused.

308
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,240
I don't want you to be scatterbrained, whatever.

309
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,040
Zach Powell is crushing it.

310
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:47,320
Okay.

311
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:53,240
Now Zach Powell came into this program, I think it was two and a half years ago

312
00:14:53,600 --> 00:15:00,480
and he was in a situation where he was in a job making, and he'll confirm this

313
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,480
thing was like five, six grand a month and he needed to get out of the job as

314
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,360
soon as possible so he could focus on, you know, his business and so he was

315
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,920
sitting there looking like, what's the quickest way I can get out of my job?

316
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,880
And he decided to take this skillset and take it a little bit different angle.

317
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,200
So he's still doing the same thing, but instead of selling the leads, he's

318
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,800
actually just selling the service SEO as a service.

319
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,560
Now you guys might've heard me talk at length about how I don't like to do this.

320
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,600
And that is the truth.

321
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:33,600
I do not at the time of, of talking at this very moment, think we have an SEO

322
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,880
client, if we do, it's like a, it's like a $500 a month client because

323
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,840
Francesca signed it.

324
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:44,840
I, I had a bad experience, um, in the long run with SEO because I did it wrong.

325
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,400
Okay.

326
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,680
So I'm going to bring on Zach today.

327
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:54,200
Zach has been able to figure out how to literally build a business brick by brick.

328
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:58,640
And I mean that because he's figured out a way to go and get deals where most

329
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:02,240
people wouldn't even, you know, consider getting deals with these SEO clients.

330
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:06,720
And he's literally built a business brick by brick and he has built it up to

331
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,680
56,000 or $57,000 per month.

332
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,480
Um, there is a correct way to do this.

333
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:17,760
And the reason for those of you, like, I want to stand by my, like my belief is

334
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:21,640
that the true way to scale this thing, the true way to have a business that's

335
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:26,640
passive that you can build today, get it ranked and not have to spend a ton of

336
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:31,520
time on it and go and live your life, travel to Dubai, you know, travel to

337
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:37,280
Africa, coach your kids' soccer team, go be a service missionary, do this, do

338
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,600
that, coach high school football.

339
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,120
That's through Legion.

340
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,560
However, I do understand that if you're in a situation where you're stuck in a

341
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:49,200
job and you want it, you need to get out of that job so you can focus on this.

342
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:53,880
Then in, in certain situations, you know, getting a few SEO deals to get those

343
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:58,280
bills paid is not a bad option, but there's a correct way to do it.

344
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,160
And there's a wrong way to do it.

345
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,320
So I'm going to have Zach come on today.

346
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,720
We're going to be talking about mindset.

347
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,480
We're going to be talking about his strategy.

348
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:08,360
We're going to be talking about a ton of different stuff, um, that Zach does, but

349
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,520
I just want to say that, so I don't want anyone to get super in the weeds,

350
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,160
confused, whatever.

351
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,640
Guys, SEO is part of lead generation.

352
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,360
We do SEO to get our leads in the long run.

353
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,120
We do the ads, we get the deal.

354
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,520
Then we do the SEO to sustain the deal to then be able to turn off ads.

355
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,440
These go hand in hand, right?

356
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:31,480
Um, so I just want you guys, again, I don't want to confuse anyone, but Zach has

357
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,520
been doing this in a strategic way.

358
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:37,920
And you can go, if you do this in a way where you go after people that are

359
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:42,360
potential lead generation clients, you can get them on an SEO deal and you can

360
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,760
turn around and sell them lead generation.

361
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,240
And the lead generation is going to be the thing that sticks.

362
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,880
And the SEO might be the thing that falls off, but Zach has figured

363
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,480
out some very cool strategies.

364
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,920
He scaled this thing up to $57,000 per month.

365
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,040
Two and a half years ago was making five to seven grand per month.

366
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,160
And I'm going to be bringing him on right now.

367
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,280
So let's welcome Mr.

368
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,040
Zach Powell.

369
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,480
Here he comes.

370
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,880
Look at this handsome devil.

371
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:11,880
He's joining right now.

372
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,600
Zach Powell.

373
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,400
What's up, bro?

374
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,440
What's up, Nick?

375
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,120
How's it going, man?

376
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,720
Dude, it's going great.

377
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,320
How are you doing?

378
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,400
Doing good.

379
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,800
Thanks for having me on, man.

380
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,520
Yeah, you're welcome, bro.

381
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,640
So you're in, um, you're not at your office office.

382
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,720
Looks like you're at your home office.

383
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,280
Cause we did this call so early.

384
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,440
Right?

385
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,440
Oh, this is the new office is actually a house.

386
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,760
So we bought like an acre, put a sweet house on it.

387
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,400
And this is the new office, man.

388
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,320
It's like, yeah, a house on some land.

389
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,160
Hold on.

390
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,200
So when you say we, was that you and your wife, you and a partner?

391
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,160
Oh yeah.

392
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:49,400
Sorry.

393
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,080
Me and my wife, we just wanted some land.

394
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,680
So we bought some land and built basically like a new office on the, on the place.

395
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,240
Dude, I love, I love the humility, bro.

396
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:02,000
So you bought an, you, you built a new house using money that you made

397
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,760
from freaking slinging deals.

398
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,240
Yeah, basically.

399
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:07,960
That's sick, dude.

400
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:08,760
When did you guys move?

401
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,960
It was like a month ago.

402
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:12,800
That's great.

403
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:13,960
Well, congrats, man.

404
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:17,200
Is that the, your, your first, like official house house, or have you guys,

405
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,120
is this like second?

406
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,600
Uh, number four.

407
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,240
Oh, you guys are movers.

408
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,480
You guys are, you guys move around.

409
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:24,800
Okay.

410
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,240
Dope.

411
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:27,840
Yeah.

412
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,800
Yeah, it's been good.

413
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:29,840
That's cool, man.

414
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,320
Well, anyway, the reason I said that guys is Zach's usually in his office.

415
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:37,720
Um, but nothing like a home office, dude, wake up, you know, get the shower

416
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,600
really quick and you're at work in five minutes.

417
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,680
So anyway, congrats on that dude.

418
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,080
And I was just given a little intro.

419
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,720
I don't know if you were listening live, but I was just telling everyone,

420
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,080
you know, for those that are new, um, well, first of all, you,

421
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,280
you're still in Phoenix, right?

422
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,440
Yep.

423
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:53,760
Yeah.

424
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,400
Queen Creek, just outside Phoenix, bro.

425
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,280
That's a, that's a, that's a, you know, that's the city that we cover in

426
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,160
the training, right?

427
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,400
Oh, that's it.

428
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:02,920
Yeah.

429
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,000
It's a great city.

430
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,920
Tons of people, tons of business owners.

431
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,440
Yeah.

432
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:10,160
So Zach, Zach was, Zach started in here when we did version one.

433
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,560
So version 2.0, bro, it's Queen Creek.

434
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:16,960
So, um, we'll make sure to go ahead and saturate Queen Creek for you.

435
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,680
I'm just kidding, bro.

436
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,560
So let's talk about your story.

437
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,840
I know you've shared it before, but just kind of give everyone the, the two

438
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:29,600
minute version of how we got here to $57,000 per month, where you were at.

439
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:35,240
And then, um, yeah, like how you, where you were at, how you got into digital.

440
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,960
And then, um, maybe the short version of how you got to $57,000 per month

441
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,960
through simple SEO deals, dude.

442
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:44,680
Yeah.

443
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,320
Good question.

444
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:49,840
So brief overview is my dad actually owns a carpet cleaning company.

445
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:55,800
Um, and he was just overpaying for all this digital marketing stuff for years.

446
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:01,000
So I started helping him kind of on the side of my job, like three and a half

447
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:06,760
years ago, and then, you know, helping him get reviews, do a better side,

448
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,240
just kind of helping him.

449
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,680
But then, um, yeah, I bought into your course and realized like, Whoa, this

450
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,280
can go much bigger than just helping my dad.

451
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:21,280
Um, and so then I started going hard and started building Legion sites, doing

452
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,720
SEO deals, just like anything I can get my hands on.

453
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,400
And then I saw a path to quit my job.

454
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,800
And when I saw that path, I was like, Oh shoot, I'm going to do that.

455
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:35,320
Um, and I actually got laid off with a bunch of people cause it's like public

456
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:39,880
company I worked for downsized and I had four months of severance and I was like,

457
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:45,000
this is my four months to just grind and make as much, get as much monthly

458
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,400
recurring revenue as possible, as quickly as possible to quit my job.

459
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:52,760
Um, so I was just talking to anybody and any deal I could get, I was, I was

460
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:57,200
getting my dad's friends and then I'm cold calling and it started just being

461
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,840
where like all these SEO deals were just falling in my lap.

462
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,800
And I was like, I have to do this.

463
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:09,040
I have to stack these $500 a month deals, $300 or whatever that person wants and

464
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,520
just quickly build their site.

465
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,200
Obviously someone in the Philippines built their site and I'm stacking it up.

466
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,240
So that's what I did.

467
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:24,640
Um, got to like 6,500 monthly recurring revenue and quit my job or I guess got

468
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,520
laid off, got another job, but quit that within a couple of weeks and just started

469
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:34,200
going, um, and it's just kind of from there, been explosive.

470
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:40,280
Like once I hired someone in the Philippines to call businesses for me every

471
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:46,280
day, now I just talk with business owners all the time and bring them over, bring

472
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,480
them over to me because they're unhappy with their situation.

473
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:52,360
Now I actually got a year ago, I brought on the sales guy, so I don't do the

474
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,240
sales anymore, but we're growing.

475
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,920
We're at like, yeah, 57,000 monthly recurring revenue, just stacking those

476
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:01,120
easy wins where it's hilarious.

477
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,280
Like sometimes we do live transfers now.

478
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,200
So like the person in the Philippines will call a business owner and then if

479
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,760
they're like unhappy with their website, they'll just live transfer to my sales

480
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:16,360
guy and sometimes like within 45 minutes, it goes from cold call deal closed.

481
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:21,120
Now we have a new client because all the work is after they pay, which that's

482
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,840
kind of fun, but yeah, it's just, it's just stacking.

483
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:28,600
And now, um, systems are built pretty well and it just keeps growing.

484
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,200
So that's exciting.

485
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,000
That's kind of the story in a nutshell.

486
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,560
Yeah, it's been, it's been a ride.

487
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,280
That's been fun.

488
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:34,880
Yeah.

489
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,080
And obviously there's so many details that you weren't able to cover there,

490
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,280
but that's in a nutshell.

491
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,240
And that's why I called this live like brick by brick, because, you know, I

492
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:47,880
think sometimes we see people, they grow really rapidly and sometimes they

493
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:51,320
land a monster client and it completely, like I've heard of people getting

494
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:55,680
like these franchise deals and then they add like 20, 30,000 revenue, right?

495
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,760
Um, which is great, but the way that Zach's built his business is literally

496
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,760
brick by brick, $500 a month, $700 a month, $300 a month.

497
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:09,440
So if tomorrow Zach had five people call him and cancel, that's not really

498
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,240
going to do that much to his business.

499
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:16,080
He's still going to be at the same spot and that's a really comfortable place to

500
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,160
be. It's a really free, mentally free place to be.

501
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:24,200
So, um, for those that have never heard you before, I want you to kind of just

502
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,640
give an outline of like your process, what you guys are doing.

503
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,240
You don't need to give too many details.

504
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:34,760
Um, but just like how you guys are getting these deals, because right now

505
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:38,880
you're, you're removed from the equation, which is you've done it really well.

506
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,880
And so now you have this team, you have this system where, and I'm not going to

507
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:47,160
like, I'm going to let you talk about it, but you guys are, are finding certain

508
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:51,200
people, you're, you're cold calling using a certain, uh, type of person.

509
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:55,000
And then you have a, like, just kind of explain how you're going about getting

510
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,360
deals from like a high level overview.

511
00:24:59,520 --> 00:24:59,960
Totally.

512
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:06,720
So it's actually crazy how many companies are unhappy with just their website and

513
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,040
their, their online presence, their SEO.

514
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,760
And so we just target those people.

515
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:16,520
Like, we'll just get a big list of like electricians or a big list of

516
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:22,200
plumbers or a big list of everybody who uses a certain marketing company

517
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,280
that we know sucks.

518
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:28,120
We go to their website and see, Oh, their pricing is $800 a month and they're

519
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,800
terrible and they have 5,000 clients.

520
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:34,720
We'll grab their client list, call all those guys and just bring them over,

521
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,800
bring them over, bring them over.

522
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:42,320
Um, so essentially the whole concept or a big piece of the concept is like

523
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,440
having offshore talent that speak perfect English, calling business owners,

524
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,600
finding people who are unhappy.

525
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:55,400
It's a super short script that we have, but like, they just find the unhappy

526
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,080
clients, unhappy business owners.

527
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,120
They talk with our sales guys and we bring them over.

528
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:06,520
Um, and it's, it's an easy pitch because they've already been thinking

529
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:10,320
about switching, like they don't like who they have, like there's so many

530
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:15,520
pain points and we just find one pain point and then, you know, we just

531
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,760
transfer them over to us.

532
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:21,440
So when I was in college, like I sold direct TV door to door.

533
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:27,360
And when I sold direct TV, all my sales were people who had dish network or

534
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:32,000
AT&T U-verse and switched them to direct TV to save them money and give them

535
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,880
like more channels.

536
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:37,400
And so that clicked with me in digital marketing.

537
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:42,040
And I was like, because the issue for almost everybody, like I guess in the

538
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:47,760
chat, like guys in the chat, just write down like, what is the hardest part

539
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,680
of growth for you?

540
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:52,920
I'm like curious, like what people struggle with when it comes to growth,

541
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,280
like in the chat, light it up if you want and I'll read, I have it up right

542
00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:01,120
here, but generally it's in a couple buckets for most people.

543
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,200
But yeah, just throw in the chat what, why you struggle with growth.

544
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:08,600
For me, it was sales.

545
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,880
And I was like, I'm having trouble like actually collecting money.

546
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,280
And that made me really mad because I was just like grinding, grinding,

547
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,400
grinding, but I wasn't collecting money.

548
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,840
And I was like, this freaking sucks.

549
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,160
I don't want to work for nothing.

550
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,800
And so I was like, what is the easiest deal possible?

551
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,720
And I thought back to my direct TV days and I was like, the easiest sale for

552
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:33,800
me to quit my job and start getting a little bit of money coming in as I'm

553
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,080
starting out was just a transfer.

554
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:40,040
If I can save someone money and give them a better product, that's

555
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,080
just like an easy switch.

556
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:45,640
They're already paying 500 bucks a month, 800 bucks a month, 400 bucks a month.

557
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:49,920
If I can just switch that to me, but give them better service, it's an easy switch.

558
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:56,280
And so I realized that there's actually thousands of business owners in the

559
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:02,480
U S paying big marketing companies and those marketing companies are doing a

560
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,920
terrible job and why don't I just like steal a little bit of their thousands

561
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:11,080
and thousands of clients, why don't I just take a little piece and just keep

562
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,720
doing that until I quit my job.

563
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
So that's what I did.

564
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:17,280
Um, Spencer saying sales for sure.

565
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:22,520
I mean, I think most people think that like the hardest part of growth is sales.

566
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:27,960
So thinking of direct TV, I was like, if I can make easy switches, that's so easy.

567
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:33,400
Um, and so that's how we set everything up, calling business owners, finding

568
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:37,920
unhappy ones, and then our pitch is essentially doing them our research.

569
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:42,240
Like everyone's doing due diligence, you know, that skill set you guys already

570
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:46,560
have, it's essentially just doing due diligence for that company and their

571
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:51,000
business and explaining, oh yeah, your website, your online presence isn't

572
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,800
good because of these things.

573
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:57,760
Um, we can do a much better job than whoever you have now that doesn't care.

574
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:02,800
Now they have a small business, this, you care about them and they just switch to

575
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,120
you and you're just stacking that monthly current revenue.

576
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,760
So that's what it's been like for me.

577
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,800
And, uh, go tying that into the training.

578
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,240
It's funny.

579
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,120
So, cause some of you guys may know I had a background in door to door

580
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:20,080
sales as well, and we, we, we learned the same thing, uh, Zach sold TV.

581
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:24,720
I sold alarm systems, but, uh, it didn't take long before you realized, Hey, if I

582
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,440
knock on a door that doesn't have an alarm system, I have to sell them on the

583
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:31,440
idea of having home security, adding a bill.

584
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:34,880
And on top of that, I have to convince them they should use my company.

585
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:39,600
And then you knock on that door that already has another company, ADT, and all

586
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,440
you have to do is convince them to pay their money to you instead of the other

587
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:43,960
company.

588
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:48,400
And instead of having an hour and 15 minute sale, it was like a 20 minute

589
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,600
sale, not emotional, logical.

590
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,640
Oh, that makes sense.

591
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,200
Same price or less.

592
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,440
And I get all this extra stuff, better service.

593
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,360
Yeah, that's, that's a no brainer.

594
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:02,880
So that's why, when we talk about building the list, we go after people who

595
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,400
are already paying for these services in a similar way.

596
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,800
Zach's doing that exact same thing.

597
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,880
Those are the people that he's targeting.

598
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:13,360
So here's the misconception that I always had about SEO is I did it and I

599
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,680
did it incorrectly because when I did SEO, I was such, it was such a desperate

600
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,280
spot.

601
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,400
I didn't have severance pay.

602
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:24,360
I just like, I was on the tail end of a failed business, right?

603
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,960
So you were a little bit smarter.

604
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,840
You had like a little bit of a runway and you were smart about it.

605
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,440
And me, I just like failed the business.

606
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,880
And I was like, I need money today.

607
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:35,400
So any money I was taking, I had a restaurant client.

608
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:44,160
I had a, like a band, like a wedding band that played like music at weddings, dude.

609
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:50,600
I had all kinds of weird clients and I could never sell them Legion A, B, I

610
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,560
didn't, none of them had commonalities.

611
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,360
There was all these just like unknowns.

612
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,680
They were all over the country.

613
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,800
I had just a bunch of weird stuff.

614
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,160
I was trying to get the biggest deals possible.

615
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,480
I was convincing people who weren't doing SEO to do SEO.

616
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:10,080
And I just had this weird smorgasbord of, of a portfolio of SEO.

617
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:15,320
And I also had big, like I had this client that was, this is when I decided SEO is

618
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:19,200
not my game, which I've changed my mind on it for sure.

619
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:24,120
Otherwise I wouldn't have brought Zach on here, but I was in, I was in a SeaWorld.

620
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,240
Zach, you've been to SeaWorld with the kids yet, bro?

621
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,680
San Diego?

622
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,360
Yeah.

623
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,120
I haven't been there, but driven past it to the beach.

624
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:33,800
Yeah, dude.

625
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,440
It's a scam, bro.

626
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,240
It's a, especially if you've been to Disneyland, you go to SeaWorld and you're

627
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,120
like, bro, this is like the, the wish.com version of Disneyland.

628
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,000
Um, it was cool when I was a kid.

629
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,720
It's not anymore.

630
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,000
No.

631
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,320
Uh, anyway, I'm at SeaWorld with the kids and I get this call from my

632
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,560
client and keep in mind, I only got like six, seven clients at the time.

633
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,960
And this client was paying me $4,000 a month.

634
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:56,880
Okay.

635
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,880
Also, I was going into really hard niches.

636
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,000
I was, it was a foundation repair client.

637
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:04,920
And dude, I just knew when I saw the call, I'm like, this guy's going to cancel.

638
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,920
And that's going to be literally at the time that was almost half of my revenue.

639
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,360
It was half of my revenue.

640
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:14,360
Took the call, dude, missed the whale show, go out over and he's

641
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,320
like, yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm done, dude.

642
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,720
It just ruined my vacation.

643
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:17,920
Right.

644
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,520
I'm like, you know, you're like sitting there cringing when you're

645
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:24,600
getting the churros now, cause the $5 churros, like it feels a lot more

646
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,600
expensive than it did.

647
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,680
And I was just like, dude, this isn't going to work for me.

648
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:33,480
But the mistake that I made is I didn't have a criteria.

649
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,480
Similarly to you guys have heard my story.

650
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,880
I tell you guys when you're doing lead generation, go into the boring

651
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,480
niches, go into these niches that are tried and true.

652
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:45,720
Zach's does, he has a very strict criteria for who he works with.

653
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:50,240
He's he, he, he, he's got all these different like boxes that have to be

654
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,960
checked and if they're checked, that's his person he's going to go in.

655
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:54,960
He's going to get the deal.

656
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,800
He already knows everything about who they're working with, where

657
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,880
the pain points are.

658
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,160
And on top of that, he set up a system where he doesn't even have to do it.

659
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:07,440
So what I want you guys to understand is if you are going to do SEO, there's

660
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,280
a strategic way to do it and I want you guys to remember people that need

661
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:15,960
SEO only want SEO because they want, generally speaking, want phone calls.

662
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:20,720
So if you can get somebody on an SEO deal, you could turn around and you

663
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,480
could sell them lead generation if they're the right client.

664
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:27,240
Now, if you go get a restaurant deal, it's going to be difficult to sell

665
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,960
them lead generation, if not impossible.

666
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,240
If you go get an e-comm company that you're ranking their website for

667
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:36,680
this specific product, first of all, that's going to be tough, but it's

668
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,120
going to be tough to sell leads.

669
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:41,600
But if you do what Zach does, he targets home service businesses in certain

670
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:46,200
niches that are unhappy at a certain price point, dude, he's just like, it's

671
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,560
like a shooting fish in a barrel.

672
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,520
You know what I mean?

673
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,560
Um, and so anyway, I want you guys to understand that.

674
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:58,480
Now, Zach, I know I'm going to forget about this, but Zach, he's he grab your

675
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,000
link because I know you did like a webinar like a year ago or maybe like

676
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:08,080
six, seven months ago, so Zach started doing this and he had a couple of

677
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:11,480
buddies, just like I did, they were like, dude, what, like, I'm sure they

678
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:15,040
were looking at you like, whoa, dude, like how's your, your situation change.

679
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,600
And I know you're not a flashy person.

680
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:20,760
So they, they probably took a while for them to catch on, but, uh, they were

681
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,600
like, what are you doing?

682
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,600
And Zach started helping.

683
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,160
I think it was like his brother-in-law and his buddy, and then they

684
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,120
started having success.

685
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:29,120
And so he ended up starting and he put together a training where he

686
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,120
actually has his own thing.

687
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,280
He teaches people how to do this.

688
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:37,200
So, um, Zach, I do want you to drop that webinar if you would in the chat.

689
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,040
And then I'll pin that.

690
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,960
So for those of you guys that are like, Hey, you want to learn more and, and

691
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,080
see what Zach's up to click on that, watch the webinar.

692
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,160
It's very cut and dry to the point.

693
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:52,240
Um, I'm actually, uh, I'm actually in that it's I've been through it.

694
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,600
It's really, really solid.

695
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,480
And there's a lot of stuff that you can also use for lead generation, just the

696
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,720
concepts and the systems and everything.

697
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,880
Um, but, uh, so yeah, drop that.

698
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,520
And then we're going to get into Q and a here in a second, but, um, tell everyone

699
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:09,040
like what your team looks like.

700
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,600
This is what's, I think so impressive dude is like two questions that we're

701
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,760
going to get into Q and a, what does your team look like?

702
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:18,600
And then what is your day to day look like right now at $57,000 per month?

703
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,760
Awesome question.

704
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,360
So yeah, first I just put the link.

705
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,600
It's actually just Zach Powell.co.

706
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,680
Um, it's just like a, I built in like five minutes.

707
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,400
It looks retarded, but it has two videos.

708
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,320
So the first one just shows like my strike page.

709
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,960
So like, you guys actually know I'm not just like some fake dude.

710
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,200
It shows my strike page.

711
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:43,080
And I talk about like each of the steps and kind of what I learned.

712
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:49,080
Um, and then the next one, um, I explained more about like what I teach

713
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:53,160
and the success of people, like the first beginning students, whatever.

714
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:56,640
Um, but yeah, check out that link if you want.

715
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:02,440
Uh, but yeah, so first my team, um, and I'll kind of answer this in phases.

716
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:06,560
So when I started out, it was just me obviously doing everything.

717
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:11,240
And then I hired, um, an appointment center or an SDR in the Philippines.

718
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,960
And he just started calling people every day.

719
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:18,440
And that's what just really got us going because now I could talk

720
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:21,520
to way more business owners and therefore close way more deals.

721
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:26,200
So from there, hired a couple more appointment setters, hired, um,

722
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,640
website builders first, just hourly.

723
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:33,760
Cause it was super cheap, like four or $5 an hour.

724
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,240
And now these people would build my websites in like eight to 10 hours,

725
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,400
brand new website.

726
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,280
And I paid like 40 bucks for it.

727
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,000
It's crazy.

728
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:47,120
So I added website builders, then added like citation builders,

729
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:50,840
um, added, um, SEO specialists.

730
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:56,320
So now the team, we have, uh, 23 people.

731
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:01,960
There's like, uh, you know, six SDRs calling business owners.

732
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:07,320
There's, um, about six SEO specialists, four website builders,

733
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,640
like a support email support.

734
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,880
Um, and yeah, so that's, that's basically the team.

735
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,240
About 23 of us for all of that.

736
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,800
Is that all out overseas?

737
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,760
It's all overseas except the sales guy, um, is here in the office with me in

738
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:30,600
Arizona, and then, um, I actually have like, uh, like general manager basically

739
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,840
in the U S as well, that kind of like manages the whole team.

740
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:41,920
So my day to day, um, I mean, it's kind of lie, dude.

741
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,360
Cause like we were going to do this call last week.

742
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,360
He's like, I'm out for the week.

743
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:51,160
And I didn't even ask, but I bet I guarantee you were doing something

744
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,520
adventurous like that, right?

745
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:54,240
Yeah.

746
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,400
I just went on like a surf trip to Nicaragua for a week, which was insane.

747
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:02,520
Um, I love not biking, but essentially, um,

748
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:10,320
like all of these systems are now built where I'm not doing any of

749
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,280
like the day to day stuff that's all covered.

750
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:19,320
My mind is purely focused on like new strategies and growth and like, um,

751
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,200
and helping my team Excel.

752
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:26,040
So like, I love training my team because these are people that

753
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:32,160
are making $500 a month, but now they can have like the best training in the world.

754
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:36,280
You know, I'm, I pay for other mentors, big money to like learn

755
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,240
the best of the best.

756
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:40,560
And then I bring that to like my group and my employees.

757
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,200
And so that's what I love doing now is like helping individual cause

758
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:47,400
they're like, if your employees grow as people, they're going

759
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,400
to help your business more.

760
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,400
So I'm training my employees.

761
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,600
I'm training my group, my connections.

762
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:56,880
Like I'm just helping everyone elevate and distributing that knowledge.

763
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,520
I love doing that.

764
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:03,320
And then I love like analyzing businesses or like aspects of the

765
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,880
business and improving those things.

766
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:12,760
So like now we have a head of digital marketing, like a head of our SEO team,

767
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,120
who's like way smarter than me when it comes to SEO.

768
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,960
And, you know, I talk with him once a week and we just like bounce ideas off

769
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:23,480
each other and then he goes and implements these new strategies to serve

770
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,840
our clients even better on the sales side.

771
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,960
I love thinking about sales.

772
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,400
I'm like, how can we be more effective?

773
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:34,280
So we used to, our SDRs used to set appointments for our closer, but

774
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,640
now it's just a live transfer.

775
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,120
They have them on the phone and boom, live transfer and the account

776
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,600
executive takes over and it helps our conversion rates.

777
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:46,320
So just looking at stuff like that and continually improving the business.

778
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,320
It's how I spend my, my day to day.

779
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,720
And it's pretty dang fun.

780
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:54,480
Like it's fun in the beginning cause it's like life or death and you

781
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,080
just got to keep adding those deals.

782
00:39:56,120 --> 00:40:01,680
And now this day is more like, um, I got to look inward and become a better

783
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,480
leader because that's what I'm doing.

784
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:08,000
So I'm really focused on like personal growth, helping my team grow training

785
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,040
and implementing new processes.

786
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:13,560
And the more I can learn, the more I can implement in my company, which

787
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,920
is a pretty fun spot to be.

788
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,760
So, yeah, so you went from like day to day in the business and now you've

789
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:23,320
been able to extract yourself and most of your time's on the business, right?

790
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:28,520
Kind of strategic decisions and, you know, visionary, where's the company

791
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,400
going, all that kind of stuff.

792
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,120
And that, that to me is the fun stuff.

793
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,680
I do actually believe it or not.

794
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:36,320
When I do get in the weeds, I have fun because it's exciting.

795
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:39,120
I kind of like makes you, you know, like when you were doing door to door sales

796
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,320
and then you were like a trainer, whatever.

797
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:44,200
And then it's like, it's so fun to get back in with the reps and

798
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,840
like, go close the deal.

799
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:46,280
Right.

800
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,600
And I still, dude, I still like to do that to this day.

801
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:54,000
Francesca closes most of our deals, um, you know, on the agency side.

802
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,840
And then for the program side is Kyle, but I'll jump on, I was on the

803
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:01,440
phone with Kyle yesterday and I just love to hear people's stories and

804
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:06,000
like, like that excitement and that also that like people are taking

805
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,160
that step into the unknown.

806
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,960
So, um, but that's a really cool spot that you're in, dude.

807
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:16,960
Um, real quick, your entire team, apart from your U S based people, how much

808
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:20,680
are you, basically you have about 20 people that are overseas, roughly.

809
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:29,040
What's your monthly nut on the 20 people rough, like just guess.

810
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:36,360
It's like, um, nine or 10,000 a month for like bananas, bro.

811
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,840
That's literally the sound they're living.

812
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:39,240
Great.

813
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,240
Like they're, they're crushing it.

814
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,680
They're, they're making double, triple one.

815
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:47,640
Quadruple, like a normal person in the Philippines.

816
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,720
Cause she's so good.

817
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:52,560
And she's no one else in her family works.

818
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:56,920
She provides for her parents, her siblings, like everyone around another

819
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:01,000
guy provides for like his parents, his family, his sister, like they make so

820
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,080
much money that they're able to provide for all these people cause they generally

821
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:08,040
live in the same house and they're like the breadwinner for like three

822
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:11,320
generations, their kids, them, and their siblings and their parents.

823
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,960
It's, it's pretty nuts.

824
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,400
So that's awesome.

825
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:20,520
So I would guess based on what you're telling me out of this 57 grant, what

826
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,760
would you say your profit margin?

827
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:26,200
Cause that's so guys that there's upsides and downsides to different,

828
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:29,120
like, uh, this is a, this is the same business.

829
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,600
It's just a different deliverable, right?

830
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:34,160
Instead of selling the leads, you're selling the service of getting the website

831
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,280
ranked same, same thing you're doing SEO.

832
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:42,760
Um, but the, the, the downside to SEO is you don't have quite as much control

833
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:43,840
because you don't own the asset.

834
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:49,960
However, the upside is you have your profit margins from day one are ridiculous.

835
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:54,240
Like you're making, like if Zach was doing the work himself, his profit

836
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,240
margins are literally like 99%.

837
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,520
Um, what's your profit?

838
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:02,160
Would you say on the 57 K it's like, it's gotta be like 80%, right?

839
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,680
75, 80%.

840
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,640
Yeah, it was that for a bit.

841
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:09,480
I just hired like a bunch of people.

842
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:15,400
So it was probably like 50% now 40, 40 to 50%, but it's like, I have

843
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:19,800
two expensive us hires a sales guy, bringing all the sales, a general

844
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,760
manager taking care of everything.

845
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:26,440
And then after and the team in the Philippines and Pakistan, after that,

846
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:29,480
it's like, you know, I'm doing what I love.

847
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:32,480
And I still make that profit, which is pretty cool.

848
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:38,080
If I, when I was doing the sales, obviously and doing, didn't have the

849
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:42,800
U S labor, then it was like around 80, 75, 80%.

850
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:45,320
Now it's about 45%, I'd say.

851
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:45,920
Yeah.

852
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:49,400
But, and the thing is though, in order for you to go to a hundred K,

853
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,480
you need those hires.

854
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:53,760
So you may, it may look like you're taking a step back, but you're just,

855
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,600
you're just basically building that foundation so you can go higher.

856
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:57,960
Right.

857
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:58,280
Yeah.

858
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:59,760
We're in, we're in growth mode now.

859
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:06,360
Like, um, so yeah, we're going to hit a hundred thousand next year.

860
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:06,680
So

861
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,640
yeah, I guarantee you.

862
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:09,200
So, okay.

863
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,240
One last quick question.

864
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:14,040
I'm going to get into some Q and a, um, the people that you're working with,

865
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,360
what's your top person doing?

866
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:19,240
Cause I know when we talked like six months ago, one of them was doing

867
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,080
like 15 K or something like that.

868
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:25,920
Is it like, how many people do you have at 10 K or what's your top person

869
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,320
doing that you're, that you've taught us to.

870
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:30,840
Oh, like in my course?

871
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:31,520
Yeah.

872
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:36,080
Um, actually, actually 54,000.

873
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:38,640
So that kind of motivated me to get things going.

874
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:42,160
I'm like, man, people are now going to surpass me.

875
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:42,960
Which one of them?

876
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:43,920
Um, that's James.

877
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:44,680
Okay.

878
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:45,760
I got James Lincoln.

879
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:47,040
Yeah.

880
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:48,040
That's dope, dude.

881
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:55,520
Um, Mitch Mitch is like over 20 or 30,000 Vinny's over 20 and he's over 20.

882
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:59,600
Like there's a lot of guys crushing it, but when James started approaching me,

883
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:01,040
he's like a good friend of mine.

884
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:04,640
I'm like, dude, I gotta ramp things up and not just like coast.

885
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,640
I love, I love that.

886
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:10,800
Well, that's a, that's always, he started like a year and a half ago.

887
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:16,160
Um, and like part-time with his doing his MBA and having a different job at

888
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,120
the same time, but he's crushing it.

889
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:23,320
Um, I launched the course a year and a half ago.

890
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:28,360
So if, and the reason I'm asking him this guy's again, this, this is,

891
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:31,280
if you want to check out his site, I pinned it at the top.

892
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:33,680
I love Zach's thing.

893
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:36,400
Cause it's literally like, like he said, it's like a video or two.

894
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,360
And, um, he just talked to him.

895
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:41,000
He just shows the proof and then he's like, here's my system.

896
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,560
And if you guys want to check it out, here it is.

897
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,760
But, um, I've talked to some of these guys.

898
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:48,400
I know like what they're up to is I get, it's got my stamp on it.

899
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,760
And so I guess I would say anybody that's in a situation where like

900
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:57,680
you need to quit your job, um, today, uh, that's something you

901
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,240
should, you should consider looking into.

902
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:02,200
And it's something you can do in tandem with what we're doing again.

903
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:06,120
I don't want you to just go picking up random SEO clients, fricking

904
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:11,240
restaurant this and, um, you know, whatever, try to be strategic.

905
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:14,440
Like if you're going to get an SEO client and your long-term goal is to do

906
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:18,000
lead gen, think about, okay, I want to get into these niches.

907
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:18,840
I want to be in fencing.

908
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,200
I want to be in duck cleaning.

909
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,000
I want to be in tree service, et cetera.

910
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,760
Go get SEO clients in those niches because you can then go and sell

911
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,720
them lead generation on the backend.

912
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:31,000
And one thing that Zach hasn't even really tapped into in one of these

913
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:36,520
days, I'm just going to go buy his list is, um, he hasn't even like, to my

914
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:40,640
knowledge, you haven't really gone and like sold these guys like lead generation.

915
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,200
It's mainly just been the SEO, right?

916
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:48,040
Mainly the SEO, but it's hilarious how easy it would be.

917
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:50,960
I just need to set up the systems because people ask me all the time,

918
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,520
like, Hey, uh, yeah, we want to get more leads.

919
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,840
Like, can you help us set up Google ads?

920
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:58,640
And I'm like, ding, ding, ding.

921
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,480
There's a lead gen client, you know?

922
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:03,640
Um, but yeah, I just need to implement those, those systems.

923
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:08,000
We've been working on like a lot of automations and stuff, which is good too.

924
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:13,560
But yeah, essentially like when you're, if you guys are focusing on.

925
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:19,640
Like, let's say artificial turf or concrete or bathroom remodels

926
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:20,840
or whatever your niche is, like.

927
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,480
You can do, this is a, this is a pro tip right here.

928
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:26,680
There's this thing called outscraper.

929
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:32,680
Um, and you can, it can pull like thousands of businesses

930
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,800
from Google business profiles.

931
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:46,240
So use outscraper, grab a list of 5,000, um, concrete companies and have an

932
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:51,040
SDR call them, and now you're getting a conversation started and you're

933
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,400
building trust with your core market.

934
00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:00,640
And then the easiest way in the door is to just do a better website for them.

935
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,720
They already have a website there to pay for it.

936
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:05,600
Um, and you can just make it way better.

937
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:08,800
And now they trust you and now your foot's in the door.

938
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,720
You're already making money from them day one.

939
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,280
Now you can quit your job.

940
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:16,160
And in your mind, you're like, dude, I already have this connection.

941
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,360
I've already pre-sold it, right?

942
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:20,880
Like Nick's all about the art of pre-selling.

943
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:24,440
You basically have a pre-sale because you have this client in your pocket.

944
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:26,480
They're a concrete company.

945
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:27,680
They trust you.

946
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:29,320
They're already paying you.

947
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:34,600
You know, you have the insights to like how much work they can handle, how

948
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:38,080
they're growing, like how many jobs they can handle each month.

949
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:40,760
And you just crush it for them.

950
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:43,040
And then you're like, Hey, do you want more jobs?

951
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:46,440
A lot of business owners do Google ads, do whatever.

952
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:52,200
I actually have leads that are only for you ready to go 10 a month.

953
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,600
And I'll sell them to you for this much.

954
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,840
I'm going to, I was going to sell them to another guy, but I'm glad that

955
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:57,840
I actually know you because now I can sell them to you.

956
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:58,480
Do you want them?

957
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,960
You have first right of refusal on these leads.

958
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,480
Of course you're going to take those jobs, right?

959
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:04,800
It's like the easiest sale up.

960
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:11,280
So yeah, check out outscraper, check out that system, check out the videos on my,

961
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:14,160
on my page, I think you guys will get some good thoughts going.

962
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:19,280
So the other thing, other reason I wanted to have Zach is even if you guys don't

963
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:22,520
take anything else from this call, because you choose not to, because you

964
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:26,960
should be taking some nuggets is like, you guys need to realize that there's

965
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:31,400
like, once you get into a business, cause you guys are in digital landlords.

966
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:35,280
I've got, I've shown you guys exactly the system that I've used, exactly how I

967
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:38,200
was able to get to a hundred thousand dollars per month, but as you get going,

968
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:42,360
you start to see opportunities that you had no idea were there.

969
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:48,840
So like, I'm pretty sure when Zach started, um, he, you know, got done with

970
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:50,400
college or whatever, did you graduate college?

971
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,800
You, you got a degree, right?

972
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:53,360
Yeah.

973
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:53,880
Okay.

974
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:54,120
Yeah.

975
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:55,920
I studied business at BYU.

976
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:56,680
Okay.

977
00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:00,920
So yeah, I, I'm guessing you probably didn't imagine yourself like managing

978
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:06,120
websites for small businesses, like whatever you probably just, it was not

979
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:08,960
even on your radar, but then you get going, you start doing, and then you

980
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:14,400
see an opportunity and boom, now you're making $57,000 a month, managing

981
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:19,120
SEO for small businesses and you have a team of 20 plus people and you're

982
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:23,240
making, you know, a lot of money, you live in the life you want to live.

983
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:24,400
And it's just, it's exciting.

984
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,960
So, um, guys, people like,

985
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:36,280
one last thought that I'll share is, um, it's actually crazy how many clients

986
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:39,840
we have that don't really care that much about SEO.

987
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:43,800
They like went with us because they just wanted a better looking website.

988
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:48,720
And those clients, I saw someone in the chat asked like about our retention.

989
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:55,080
Um, I've been doing this for like about two and a half years, like focusing on

990
00:50:55,080 --> 00:51:01,480
this and we have clients that we've had for over a year, over two years because

991
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:05,040
they just like us, they like the look of their site.

992
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:09,080
They get most of their business from word of mouth anyway, but they

993
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:10,240
just want to be online.

994
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:14,760
And so like the SEO is like low priority for them.

995
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:18,800
So yeah, we're doing it and we're, we're doing the SEO, but they

996
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:19,640
don't actually care about it.

997
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:23,680
They are basically in their minds, they're just paying 500 bucks a month.

998
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:27,840
So they have a good looking website and someone that they can email to

999
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:29,360
make updates whenever they want.

1000
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:34,960
Um, and yeah, like SEO is being done and they have like our expertise.

1001
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,680
They can email and say, Hey, what should we do here?

1002
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:40,000
We give them like their Google review links so they can text it out.

1003
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:45,880
Like we do some things for them, but so many of these people are just like,

1004
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:49,960
Oh, I'm just paying 500 bucks a month for my website, 300 bucks, bucks

1005
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:51,080
a month for my website.

1006
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:52,680
That's not something you cancel.

1007
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:55,040
You want to have a website online.

1008
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:58,680
And so it's, it's actually crazy.

1009
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:02,080
Like I could tell, I could fire my whole SEO team.

1010
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:08,760
We could stop making sales and there would still be probably about 10 to

1011
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:13,200
20,000 monthly recurring revenue that would just sit there for years and years

1012
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:17,360
and years because we have their website lives and that's all they care about.

1013
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,240
It's pretty crazy.

1014
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:22,520
So there's some people that really care and that, um, you know, we do

1015
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:26,120
obviously do a great job for them, but we even do a great job for people

1016
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:28,080
that don't care, but I just like talking with them.

1017
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:31,640
I just know they're not going to turn cause they just like how their website

1018
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:34,760
looks and they're going to pay us 500 bucks a month because like we're their

1019
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:38,200
online guys and we're their only connection to like the online world.

1020
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:40,400
And it's really weird, man.

1021
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:43,880
Like you get those, you get those deals and you kind of know them.

1022
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:49,520
And I'm like, this is the easiest craziest thing in the world, but they love

1023
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:53,680
it because they feel confident in us taking care of it all really well.

1024
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:54,440
So

1025
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:57,680
these are like people that have just decided that they're just going to have

1026
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:01,480
that monthly fee forever and they, they, maybe they haven't even consciously

1027
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:03,600
decided, but yeah, to them, that's just how it is.

1028
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:04,360
That's just the fee.

1029
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:07,360
And that's one of the things Zach does really well is he's strategic about the

1030
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:11,400
people that he targets and he's targeting people that are already comfortable with

1031
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:14,720
this bill and, uh, that's what makes the retention.

1032
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:19,120
So again, there's so many, there's so many commonalities with what I talk

1033
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:23,200
about with what Zach's saying is when I always say, Hey, that, you know, the

1034
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,760
money's made or lost in picking the right city in the right niche and picking

1035
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:29,200
the business owner, you guys pick the right business owner in the right

1036
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:32,960
city and niche, your retention is going to be so much lower.

1037
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:35,040
You pick a high maintenance business owner.

1038
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:37,720
I don't care how many leads you're piping them full of.

1039
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,000
It's going to be difficult.

1040
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,800
So it all comes down to how you do that.

1041
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,560
And Zach has a really good system for how he selects those people and how

1042
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:44,960
he goes after them, what he says.

1043
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:48,800
And it's from the second you make that initial call until you close the deal.

1044
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:52,000
But, um, anyway, Zach Powell, thanks for jumping on this call, dude.

1045
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:53,040
Really appreciate it.

1046
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:57,080
57 K per month from, uh, from what were you making before?

1047
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:03,040
Around five to seven gross, um, 70,000 a year.

1048
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:05,200
So like $4,500 a month.

1049
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:05,560
Yeah.

1050
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:06,160
Amazing.

1051
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,360
Quite a bit different now.

1052
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:07,960
It's crazy.

1053
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:09,400
That's wild.

1054
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:13,400
And, uh, here we are a couple of years later and I've, I've, I've seen

1055
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:17,200
this firsthand in my life and I always say this is like, you're closer than

1056
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:20,120
you think to getting to your, to the goals that you have in the life that

1057
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:21,040
you, that you want.

1058
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:24,120
And it's like, I think it's in this book at the beginning.

1059
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:27,040
It talks about the three feet of being three feet from gold.

1060
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:31,720
Um, I know for me, what eight months before I hit a hundred thousand dollars

1061
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:34,440
a month, I was, I was $60,000 in debt.

1062
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:35,200
I had no idea.

1063
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:38,320
I was almost ready to give up on, on being a business owner.

1064
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:44,240
And, uh, and I know for you, your, your growth was much more like stable and

1065
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:50,080
consistent, but nonetheless, two and a half years ago, you were just paying the

1066
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:54,360
bills and now you're building a new house, going to Nicaragua on a random

1067
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:56,640
October week to, to go surfing, dude.

1068
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:57,480
That's amazing.

1069
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:58,560
I love that, bro.

1070
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:00,000
The waves were good.

1071
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:00,760

00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:03,080
