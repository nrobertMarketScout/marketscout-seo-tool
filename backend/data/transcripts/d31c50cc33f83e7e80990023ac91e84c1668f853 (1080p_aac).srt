1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,920
All right guys, so we've chosen a niche.

2
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,000
We're not going to overthink it.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,880
If you don't know, just going back to what we talked about before, choose concrete.

4
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,720
If you're going to be analysis paralysis and delay choosing, just choose concrete.

5
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,720
Okay?

6
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:27,080
So we've chosen the niche, we've done our keyword research, and now it's time to go

7
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,080
and find the city.

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,880
I don't want you to overthink this too much, but I also want you to understand how important

9
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,440
it is that we do this correctly.

10
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,000
This is where all the money is made and also, unfortunately, where all the money is lost.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,440
All right, so guys, the very first thing we're going to do is we're going to go and get a

12
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,000
tool that shows us demand, shows us search volume.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,960
And for some of you that chose Ahrefs or Mangools or SEMrush or any of these things, it doesn't

14
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,960
matter.

15
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,960
Okay?

16
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,960
And I'm going to explain why.

17
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,960
So let me just show you this really quick.

18
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,960
All right.

19
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,680
So this, I'm going to show you guys SEMrush, SEMrush.com, SEMrush, it is a little bit more

20
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,680
expensive tool.

21
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,680
It's just something I've been using for years and years and years.

22
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm just going to use it.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You can use any tool.

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And I want to stress the importance to you guys that tools do not tell the truth.

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Okay?

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
These tools are not accurate.

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Let me repeat that.

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,960
These tools are not accurate.

29
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,400
And so you're not going to take these at face value.

30
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,400
The reason that we're using tools is we want to look at comparisons.

31
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,400
Okay?

32
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,120
We want to see, all right, for example, we have, maybe there's a project that you've

33
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:33,920
done in Minnesota, Minnesota Tree Service or Minnesota Concrete, okay?

34
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,360
Or not Minnesota, sorry, Minneapolis, Minneapolis Concrete, Minneapolis Tree Service.

35
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:42,800
And you can then in your head, let's say you've ranked that website, you're in the maps, everything's

36
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,760
fine and dandy.

37
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:48,400
And you can look at the tools, let's say you're using Mangools.

38
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,360
Well, Mangools tells you that there's only, you know, 50 people searching for Tree Service

39
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,480
in Minneapolis and you're ranked number one and you're ranked number one in the maps and

40
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,600
you're getting a hundred calls a month.

41
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:07,120
So therefore we can infer or we can interpret that if Mangools tells us it's 50, it's probably

42
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,280
close to a hundred.

43
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,120
So I want to be very clear that these tools are not accurate.

44
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,520
The tool does not matter.

45
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:17,440
What matters, guys, is that we're consistent with the tool that we use.

46
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,720
Okay, so I'm going to use SEMROSH, SEMROSH, I don't even know how they say it, that's

47
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,240
how much I care about tools.

48
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,240
Just pick one, okay?

49
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,240
Don't overthink it.

50
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,760
If you want something free, use Google Keyword Planner, it's fine.

51
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,880
That's step one.

52
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:33,360
Step two is what we're going to do is we're going to take a project that you have ranked

53
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,780
number one in the maps for most of the top terms and number one organically, okay?

54
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,600
And that's for a couple of months.

55
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,840
Now some of you guys are going to go, well, I'm brand new to this, I've never done that.

56
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,040
If that is the case, or if you have other projects and you just want to make this easy,

57
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm going to let you use one of mine to do the following exercise.

58
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,960
So what we're going to do is we're going to take a site that's been ranking for years

59
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:59,160
and we're going to in our heads go, okay, this site based on data has produced this

60
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,160
many leads.

61
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,100
So the site that we're going to use is the trusty old Bentonville Concrete, which I am

62
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:07,400
ranking top in the maps, top in the organic, and I've done this for years and years.

63
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:14,040
And this site has consistently produced between 20 and 35 leads pretty much every month for

64
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,320
the past three years, two and a half, three years, okay?

65
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,920
So what we want to do is we want to take your tool.

66
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,960
So let's, in my case, I'm going to use SEMrush, right?

67
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,800
So I'm going to go to SEMrush or SEMrush, I'm not even sure how to say it, and I'm going

68
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,680
to type in Bentonville Concrete, okay, and I'm going to see what it says.

69
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:37,000
So this tool tells me, it tells me there's 40 volume, okay?

70
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,160
In fact, let me go and check recently what we've gotten here, give me a second here.

71
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,580
Because what's, and this is going to be an interesting point, okay.

72
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:45,840
So let me just give you an example here.

73
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,040
It's June 14th at the time of recording this.

74
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:56,880
We got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, literally one

75
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,220
a day, okay?

76
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:04,520
So we can pretty easily estimate that, you know, according to this, that's actually fairly

77
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,520
accurate.

78
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:11,040
Last month, we can go to May, well, this, you know, this is actually going to be changing

79
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,040
it.

80
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:20,320
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18,

81
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:31,440
19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40,

82
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,640
41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, okay.

83
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,000
So here's a couple of interesting things.

84
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,300
Number one is this is not accurate because this has changed.

85
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,760
Just for the record, since I started doing this, this has changed.

86
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,080
The data has changed.

87
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,040
This part of the country has gotten a big influx of people.

88
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,720
There's a lot of building going on, huge building boom.

89
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,100
This didn't used to say 40, just so you know.

90
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:59,040
And also, you guys are going to laugh because this also used to be about $2 cost per click.

91
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,320
There's been a lot of people jump into the space.

92
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,840
There's been a lot of competitors, a lot of people running ads, and so this has changed.

93
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,480
But I still want you to see that even though this says 40, I'm actually getting more than

94
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,680
40 leads, okay.

95
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,800
I'm getting about 1.25 to every time it says 4.

96
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,880
So if this says 40, it's probably closer to 50, okay.

97
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,640
We can kind of assume based on this.

98
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,520
And if I want to check maybe one more month, you know, I could go and do that.

99
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,520
Look at April.

100
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,520
And I've got three pages.

101
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,760
That looks like it's a pretty accurate estimate.

102
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,080
We're probably getting 50 to 60 leads at this point.

103
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,720
And it's funny because that's how long it's been since I've checked it.

104
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:36,660
So we're going to just base, basically anything that SEM rush says, we're going to, and again,

105
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:37,880
this isn't perfect.

106
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:41,760
We're just going to assume that anything SEM rush says or SEM rush says, it's going to

107
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,260
be about 1.25 to whatever it says, okay.

108
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,580
So now we've got our baseline.

109
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:50,720
If you guys want to use my Bentonville concrete project as a baseline, great.

110
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,300
If you want to use something else, that's great.

111
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,760
The point is we want to find a ratio.

112
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:59,200
We want to see what it says with this one compared to another one.

113
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:03,360
And guys, if you have multiple projects, I would highly encourage you to look at this

114
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,280
on multiple projects so you can get a good baseline number so that, okay.

115
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,200
And you guys might type this into keyword planner and it's going to say 10.

116
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:16,000
And you're going to know, okay, every time it says 10, it's probably closer to 50, okay.

117
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,200
And that's what I want you guys to look at is we want to have that baseline.

118
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,440
We got to come up with that baseline ratio to say, okay, when it says this, it actually

119
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,280
is 1.25 of whatever it says, okay.

120
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,840
So that's step two.

121
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,760
Now let's get into the fun stuff, all right.

122
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:34,160
What I'm going to have you guys do now that we've gotten a baseline, which according to

123
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,240
SEMrush, you're going to use this, it's probably going to be about 1.25 to whatever it says.

124
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,440
I'm now going to go over to this little tool that's free.

125
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,360
It's called Google Trends, okay.

126
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,360
Step three.

127
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,360
We're going to go to Google Trends.

128
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,160
You're going to type it in, in your whatever search bar and click on it.

129
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,140
And what you're going to do is you're going to plug in your main keyword.

130
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:56,500
So I'm going to, and it doesn't need to be the main one, it could be a main one.

131
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,300
So let's just do concrete, do concrete contractors.

132
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:05,740
I would do concrete, but concrete also encompasses ready mix concrete, a bunch of different stuff,

133
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:06,740
people that do projects with concrete.

134
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:10,640
So I'm going to do concrete contractors because that's somebody that is most likely looking

135
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,820
for somebody to pour concrete, okay.

136
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:15,980
So that's what you're going to do is you're going to type in concrete contractors.

137
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:20,780
And what this tool is going to do is it's going to tell you what states have the highest

138
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:26,660
search volume in the United States for this specific term.

139
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:30,220
And by the way, you guys can use this in different countries, et cetera, okay.

140
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:33,540
So you're going to go, and this is how you're going to pick a state because what I don't

141
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:36,000
want you to do is look at a map and just throw a dart.

142
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,940
Now if you live in a city, and I do want to mention this really, really briefly.

143
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,620
This is a really important point.

144
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,700
Do not go into California, okay.

145
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,840
Do not go into California.

146
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:49,880
If you live in California and you're targeting your backyard or if you have projects already

147
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,640
that you've built, I don't want you to get discouraged.

148
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:57,720
You can still make money, but I'm telling you right now, there is a lot easier money

149
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,480
to make outside of California.

150
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,340
And this is coming from experience, from calling, cold calling, this is coming from experience

151
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,340
knocking doors.

152
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:08,300
This is coming from experience of traveling there.

153
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:14,220
There is just a certain vibe, a certain distrust that happens in that state and it's not worth

154
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,220
your time, okay.

155
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,480
I'm telling you right now, if you're starting from scratch, do not go into California.

156
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:22,020
If you're going to get dinged on, you know, oh, your licensing isn't done or you don't

157
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:25,540
have this on your site or whatever, it's going to be in California, mark my words.

158
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:29,200
So if you have not built sites already, avoid the state.

159
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,200
Not because I don't like it.

160
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,280
I've got friends that live there, I go there a couple of times a year, we've got Disneyland

161
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,120
season passes baby, I'll go there all day long.

162
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,040
But for business, for this type of stuff, avoid California.

163
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,260
I don't know how much I need to emphasize that.

164
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:46,640
And also if you have projects, if you live there and have projects, it's okay.

165
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,640
You can still make money.

166
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,880
I'm just telling you going forward, okay.

167
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,480
So what you're going to do is you're going to go here, you're going to type in your main

168
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,760
term and you're going to select a state.

169
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,560
Now one word of caution, one little thing I want to mention when you're selecting a

170
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,760
state is think about this year round.

171
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:03,080
I don't want, you know, a really, really cold state where it's going to get icy blizzard

172
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,480
cold and no one can pour concrete.

173
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,120
So for example, I'm probably not going to hit South Dakota, okay.

174
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,520
It's going to do really well in the summer, maybe okay in the spring, good in the spring,

175
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,520
good in the fall.

176
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,580
In winter, I'm going to lose my client, okay.

177
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:18,720
Or I'm going to have to really do some kind of a deal where they stay on with me.

178
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,660
So what I like to do is I like to go through these top states and I like to look at ones

179
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:26,560
just intuitively, okay, that one's not as cold, right.

180
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,820
So for example, like Utah, I know it's really cold in some parts of state, but where I live,

181
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,200
it never gets cold.

182
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,540
So there's literally the city I live in never gets cold.

183
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:38,700
I have palm trees, people have swimming pools, it's stucco, okay.

184
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,220
Tennessee that'd be a great example.

185
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,980
That one gets cold, but not crazy cold.

186
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:49,560
South Carolina, decent, right, or I don't know, not Oregon.

187
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,140
North Carolina would be okay, but it still gets kind of cold.

188
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,100
But I'm talking more like the Florida's, right.

189
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,140
Florida never gets cold, relatively speaking.

190
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,900
Nevada never gets cold, relatively speaking.

191
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,500
Texas does get cold, but not as bad.

192
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,740
It's not like, you know, there's always snow.

193
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,180
So just keep that in mind.

194
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:08,100
And what I'm going to do is I want you guys to, I'm going to tell you the state I'm going

195
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,540
to go into, but I just want to give you ideas.

196
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,380
This is a good way to narrow down states and give you ideas.

197
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:17,820
What you can do is once you select a state, you can then, if you want city ideas, you

198
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:23,340
can actually click on the state and typically it will tell you the highest searched cities

199
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:26,960
or areas within that state, which is a really cool thing to do, okay.

200
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:31,260
But you also can, can rest assured that if there's a lot of searching, there's probably

201
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,260
a lot of competition.

202
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:35,420
So what I want you to do is just use this tool to pick a state.

203
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:40,060
And for this example, for this training, I'm going to use the state of Arizona.

204
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,060
Why?

205
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,060
I live close to it.

206
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:45,020
Utah does kind of I've been there.

207
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,860
I have multiple projects there.

208
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,540
It's warm most of the time.

209
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,420
I love that because I don't have to worry about on and off and everything else.

210
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,940
And I've had really good luck with contractors.

211
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:55,740
I'm going to choose Arizona for concrete.

212
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:59,740
And so what I want you to do is once you select your state, I want you to go type in, you

213
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:02,220
know, Arizona cities by population.

214
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:02,460
Okay.

215
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,820
And you're going to just click on one of the links.

216
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,460
Doesn't matter.

217
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:10,780
And what I want you to do from there is go down and start about like the 50,000 or so

218
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:11,420
population.

219
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,060
Okay.

220
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,620
I want to work from the bottom up because I want to go.

221
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:15,820
Guys, I want you to realize this.

222
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:22,620
I want to choose the smallest population city that still meets the minimum requirements

223
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,980
for demand.

224
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:27,740
And that's the city I want to target because think about all the big guys, think about

225
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:31,820
the big companies, the big budgets and the big crews and all the money.

226
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,340
They want to go into the big cities.

227
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:33,500
Right.

228
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,500
So in Arizona, you know what they want to go into?

229
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,540
They want Phoenix.

230
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,060
They want Tucson.

231
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,980
They want Mesa.

232
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,180
They want Flagstaff.

233
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:41,580
Whatever.

234
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:41,980
I don't know.

235
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,180
I don't even know what Flagstaff is.

236
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:45,100
They want the big cities that you can see on the map.

237
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:46,780
I don't.

238
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:47,500
I want cities.

239
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,380
No one's looking at.

240
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:51,820
I want to be obscure with my city selection because no one's doing it.

241
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,460
And I'm going to kind of cheat the system here because I know a city that's going to

242
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:57,740
crush it because I've got other projects and other niches in the city.

243
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:58,940
But I want to show you what I would do.

244
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:04,540
So from here, what you would do is you would select cities starting at 50 K and you would

245
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,580
work your way up.

246
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:08,780
So we're going to take Maricopa and you're going to go back over to your tool and you're

247
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:14,940
going to type in your main keyword or one of them and then type in the city and state

248
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:15,740
abbreviation.

249
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:16,060
Okay.

250
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:19,740
So Concrete Contractors Maricopa, Arizona.

251
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,940
And we're going to see if it pulls any volume and it does 50.

252
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:23,500
Great.

253
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,140
Awesome.

254
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,140
We're good to go and we're just going to leave it.

255
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,340
Then we're going to go to the next one.

256
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:27,500
Okay.

257
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,780
So the next one is going to be Catalina Foothills.

258
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,460
So I'm going to go over here.

259
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,660
Sam Rush.

260
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:36,060
I'm going to type in Concrete Contractors.

261
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:41,660
Catalina Foothills AZ.

262
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,420
Did I spell that right?

263
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,020
Probably not.

264
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:46,860
Catalina.

265
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:47,820
Yes, I did.

266
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:48,140
Okay.

267
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,700
Now, if you do the first term, don't give up.

268
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,660
Do some variation.

269
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,180
So try just Concrete.

270
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:54,540
Okay.

271
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,260
Nothing.

272
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,380
Try getting rid of Arizona.

273
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:02,540
Be careful when you get rid of this abbreviation because sometimes multiple cities, there's

274
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,980
the same name city multiple states.

275
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,580
Make sure you're not looking at the wrong state.

276
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:09,580
I'll try doing Catalina Foothills Concrete, you know, opposite order.

277
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,260
And I'm just not seeing anything.

278
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,140
I'll try one more.

279
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:12,380
Okay.

280
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:17,180
So this one's kind of one of those where I'm just going to assume there's not a ton of

281
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:17,740
volume.

282
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:17,980
Okay.

283
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:20,140
And so I'm going to just, it is what it is.

284
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:20,780
Okay.

285
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:21,260
Next one.

286
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:25,340
And this is the one that I'm going to actually go into, which is Queen Creek.

287
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,220
I've built projects here.

288
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,340
This is an up and coming city.

289
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,660
I've got this like information from clients.

290
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,580
They're like, this city is growing like crazy.

291
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,140
It's awesome.

292
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,660
It's going to keep expanding.

293
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,780
So I'm, I already knew before I did this, this was going to be a good city.

294
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:40,140
And so I did concrete Queen Creek, Arizona.

295
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:44,140
Lo and behold, there's 30 volume and we are good to go.

296
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:51,260
So what I want you to look at, I'm going to type in concrete contractors, Queen Creek AZ.

297
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:54,220
So it doesn't pull a lot for the concrete contractors.

298
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,740
Let me do concrete patio.

299
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:59,740
No, let's try Queen Creek concrete.

300
00:13:59,740 --> 00:13:59,980
Okay.

301
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,020
We know there's a term.

302
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,460
Give me a sec here.

303
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,140
Okay.

304
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:04,540
Concrete.

305
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:09,740
So the only one that's pulling volume is the concrete Queen Creek.

306
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:15,740
So that's something to note is it does pull volume, but it's lower than Bentonville concrete

307
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:19,500
and it doesn't pull volume for every term, but it might just be the perfect one.

308
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,340
So then what you're going to do is now we've looked at a couple of cities and you guys,

309
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,700
you might have to do this for 10.

310
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,100
Okay.

311
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:30,140
You're going to want to do this at least five, uh, probably five to 10 cities and you're

312
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:35,500
just going to look at the cities and just see what they say when you add the city and the state

313
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,580
abbreviation to the end of the term.

314
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,380
Okay.

315
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:43,900
So I want you to start at the 50 K population, work your way up and see which cities do that.

316
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:48,380
And then what I want you to do guys is you're going to select the city based on the following.

317
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:51,100
You're going to look at these and here's the criteria that it has to match.

318
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,340
Yes, it has to have volume.

319
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:57,980
I recommend it having volume within at least 10 of what Bentonville concrete had, which

320
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,500
Bentonville concrete was 40.

321
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:04,380
So this one right here is it's got to be at least within 10 or, or more.

322
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:04,620
Right.

323
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,500
So this one fits the bill because it's 50.

324
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:11,580
This one does not fit the bill because it's zero and this one fits the bill because it's

325
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:12,140
really close.

326
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:15,340
It's 30, but here's the kicker.

327
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:18,140
And this is something I've talked about over and over and over again.

328
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:21,180
We have to pay attention to the cost per click.

329
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,460
This is the CPC.

330
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:25,980
For those of you that don't know what that is, that is when you go to Google and you

331
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,540
type in concrete Phoenix.

332
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,140
And these people at the top, you see how this says ad.

333
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:35,100
And I know some of you guys like this is very basic guys, just relax.

334
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,180
It's something to remind everyone about.

335
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,460
You see how these say ads.

336
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,940
These right here, people are paying per click.

337
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,740
That's why it's cost per click.

338
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:47,180
So me as a consumer, if I click on this ad right now, if I push click, which I'm not

339
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:54,780
going to do, it is going to charge this company, whatever the amount it costs in Phoenix.

340
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:58,540
So if we want to look, this is probably not going to be 100% accurate, but let's just

341
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,340
look for fun.

342
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,420
So let's just do concrete Phoenix.

343
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:04,460
And it's going to be higher, I would assume, than the other ones.

344
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,260
Actually, it's not bad, believe it or not.

345
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:08,860
Not bad.

346
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,060
374.

347
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:13,180
I'm actually really shocked, but you know what else is interesting?

348
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,180
There's only 30 people searching for it.

349
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:16,780
That's weird.

350
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:21,260
Okay, go to concrete companies in Phoenix.

351
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:27,660
You got 210, ton of volume, and it's got CPC, but here's what you also got to realize.

352
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:30,940
You also have to have your intuition play into this and realize these tools aren't

353
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:31,980
necessarily accurate.

354
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:35,020
Guys, everyone's going to want to rank for Phoenix.

355
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,620
I promise you that.

356
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:40,220
And so I'm just telling you, when we go into the next steps, which is actually assessing

357
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:44,380
and looking at the competition, my intuition tells me it's probably going to be really

358
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:44,940
competitive.

359
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:49,900
So you're going to look at these different cities and you're going to make sure, and

360
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:56,140
you're going to find one that has at least within 10 or more of what Bentonville Concrete

361
00:16:56,140 --> 00:17:00,540
is, which is 40 search volume, according to SEMrush on this tool.

362
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:08,780
And then you got to make sure it has a CPC of less than $5, but more than zero.

363
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:15,820
If the CPC is $0, $0 cost per click, you can safely assume that that traffic is worth

364
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,580
nothing because no one else wants it.

365
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,020
So why would I, right?

366
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,700
So for example, in this one, yeah, cool.

367
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,300
There's 50 people searching for it.

368
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:25,020
It says, but no one's actually bidding on it.

369
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:28,940
No one's paying for clicks, which tells me it's probably worth nothing.

370
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:34,940
So I've, and I've tested this, guys, you're not going to get like, for some reason, it

371
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:35,820
just doesn't work.

372
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,740
So if it says zero, it doesn't work.

373
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,740
If it says 10, it typically doesn't work.

374
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:44,860
And I'm telling you right now, if I was doing Bentonville Concrete today, I would repeat

375
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:45,260
this.

376
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:49,660
I would not go into Bentonville Concrete today, but when I'm telling you, when I did this

377
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,980
a couple of years ago, it was like two bucks.

378
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:52,300
Okay.

379
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:56,220
Now, luckily I'm ranked organically, so this doesn't matter, but I would not be going into

380
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,180
Bentonville Concrete today.

381
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,980
When I did a couple of years ago, it was not this competitive.

382
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:00,300
Okay.

383
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,940
Thanks to me, it is.

384
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:11,340
So from these searches, we are now going to identify two or three cities that have volume.

385
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,020
Excuse me.

386
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:18,300
They have volume that's within 10 of Bentonville Concrete or whatever city you choose that's

387
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:27,500
got at least 30, 40, 50 leads per month or more, and it has a CPC of less than $5, but

388
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,140
greater than zero.

389
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:30,780
Okay.

390
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:34,220
So quick, quick, quick, quick recap.

391
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:34,460
Okay.

392
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,700
Number one, you are going to go and you're going to pick a tool.

393
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,140
Step one.

394
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:40,460
Okay.

395
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,340
Doesn't matter what it is.

396
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,860
Paid, free, don't care.

397
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,620
You're going to go figure out what the baseline is.

398
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:48,460
What I mean by that is pick a project that's ranking that you know is getting leads and

399
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:52,540
it's been getting leads for years and years organically, and you know how many leads it's

400
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:52,780
getting.

401
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:57,580
If you don't have one, use Bentonville Concrete and figure out how that compares to what the

402
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,220
tool says.

403
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,260
That's your baseline.

404
00:18:59,260 --> 00:18:59,500
Okay.

405
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,660
So that's number two.

406
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:05,660
Step three is you're going to use Google Trends to identify a state to start with.

407
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:05,900
Okay.

408
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:09,260
If you have a state in mind, awesome, but if you don't know and you're in a new niche

409
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,500
or whatever, go pick a state.

410
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:19,820
From there, you're going to type into Google state plus cities in population with population,

411
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:20,940
order of population, whatever.

412
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:23,340
So Arizona cities by population.

413
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,140
Utah cities by population.

414
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:32,300
And you're going to then start at 50,000, go to the bottom, start at 50,000, put those

415
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:37,580
into your tool with the city and state variation and find

416
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:45,420
cities where it pulls at least what Bentonville Concrete pulls or it's within 10 or more.

417
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:50,300
And it has a CPC of less than $5 and more than zero.

418
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:55,180
And guys, if you can find two or three cities with it meet those metrics following that

419
00:19:55,180 --> 00:20:00,140
system, you have got three potential, two to three potential cities that you are going

420
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,820
to go and make money on.

421
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:04,220
And that is what you're going to do to start.

422
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:06,620
And next guys, what we're going to do next is we're going to go and we're going to dig

423
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:07,020
into that city.

424
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:07,980
We're going to analyze that city.

425
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:11,020
We're going to do the market research on that city before we just start building.

426
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:12,620
Do those steps.

427
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:21,820
See you in the next video.
