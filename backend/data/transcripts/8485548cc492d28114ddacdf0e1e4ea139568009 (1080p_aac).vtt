00:00.000 --> 00:09.880
Alright, so now we're going to buy our domain for our website.

00:09.880 --> 00:16.440
We usually use GoDaddy, I know there's tons of other options you can have, so pick whatever

00:16.440 --> 00:17.440
you like.

00:17.440 --> 00:19.640
I'm just showing you again what we use.

00:19.640 --> 00:24.760
So once you create an account, you are going to search for your domain.

00:24.760 --> 00:32.200
And what we like to pick is ideally first the city and then the service.

00:32.200 --> 00:39.600
So in our case it would be Queen Creek Concrete.

00:39.600 --> 00:45.080
And we always like it to end with .com.

00:45.080 --> 00:51.280
Search domain, let's see if that's available.

00:51.280 --> 00:55.160
So we don't want to spend that much.

00:55.160 --> 00:59.280
And GoDaddy will show you the options that you have.

00:59.280 --> 01:01.000
So let's try to flip it.

01:01.000 --> 01:14.080
Let's do Concrete and then QueenCreek.com, see if that's available, see if it's not available.

01:14.080 --> 01:23.040
So what we like to do is put the location back and just put a little divider right there,

01:23.040 --> 01:29.240
put Concrete, alright, search domains, ok that's available.

01:29.240 --> 01:30.960
So perfect.

01:30.960 --> 01:35.720
We definitely never want to switch to .com, we don't want to do .co, .net, blah blah

01:35.720 --> 01:36.720
blah.

01:36.720 --> 01:51.000
So QueenCreek.com, continue to cart, perfect.

01:51.000 --> 01:55.880
We definitely just want to do a year to start off.

01:55.880 --> 02:02.920
And then we always like to add the full domain protection, so get it.

02:02.920 --> 02:12.800
And then I'm ready to pay.

02:12.800 --> 02:22.160
And then complete purchase.

02:22.160 --> 02:26.520
And after we're done purchasing we're going to connect it to our Weebly website, should

02:26.520 --> 02:29.360
be fairly simple.

02:29.360 --> 02:34.560
There you go, perfect.

02:34.560 --> 02:45.960
So I am going to continue connecting to an existing site.

02:45.960 --> 02:54.000
Ok, and the destination is Weebly, right here.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Connect domain.

02:56.000 --> 03:00.160
Ok, and here is going to give you the steps.

03:00.160 --> 03:04.160
Go to Weebly, click edit next to your site, want to connect, click settings and then click

03:04.160 --> 03:06.240
change under site.

03:06.240 --> 03:15.040
So make sure you copy this right here, command copy, go back to Weebly, and what we like

03:15.040 --> 03:22.680
to do is click publish just to save it.

03:22.680 --> 03:27.440
So we're going to click save and publish, we like to just do the pro up here.

03:27.440 --> 03:33.360
The reason why we publish it, it's because that's how you save websites on Weebly.

03:33.360 --> 03:37.920
So anytime you make an edit, make sure you always click the publish, publish, publish.

03:37.920 --> 03:41.800
Then we're going to click exit, now you can click out of it.

03:41.800 --> 03:43.840
So this is our website that we built.

03:43.840 --> 03:49.280
Click, just click right here, don't click on edit website, just click right here, ok.

03:49.280 --> 03:54.840
Click on these three dots and then edit domain.

03:54.840 --> 03:59.560
You're going to click provide your domain and you're going to paste in the domain that

03:59.560 --> 04:00.840
you just bought.

04:00.840 --> 04:17.840
Click save, perfect, and then you're actually going on edit website, ok, domain, click on

04:17.840 --> 04:21.440
settings, we want to change that.

04:21.440 --> 04:29.920
So just name it the same as the page title, queen creek concrete, uncheck that, click

04:29.920 --> 04:40.800
save, enable SSL, ok, it should tell you that, then click publish again, because again we

04:40.800 --> 04:47.000
always want to save everything that we're doing, ok, perfect, and you're done.

04:47.000 --> 04:55.280
And just so you know, right now it says not secure, because when we clicked on settings,

04:55.280 --> 04:56.400
it's still doing it.

04:56.400 --> 05:02.380
So just make sure you check on it later and it is secure and you're done, that's all you

05:02.380 --> 05:02.880
need to do.
