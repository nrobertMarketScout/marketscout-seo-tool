00:00.000 --> 00:02.160
you're going to go for the close, okay?

00:02.160 --> 00:06.020
My tip on that, do it on Zoom and do it in the morning

00:06.020 --> 00:09.980
before they go to work, before the day starts.

00:09.980 --> 00:12.980
And honestly, I've had some of my best success

00:12.980 --> 00:14.900
doing deals on Saturday morning.

00:14.900 --> 00:17.340
Sounds crazy, sounds weird, but guess what?

00:17.340 --> 00:18.480
A lot of times during the week,

00:18.480 --> 00:20.380
these guys are fricking running their business.

00:20.380 --> 00:21.820
They're not working on their business.

00:21.820 --> 00:23.420
They're working in their business.

00:23.420 --> 00:26.340
So I used to schedule calls when I was actively doing them.

00:26.340 --> 00:28.500
Now we have people in closers,

00:28.520 --> 00:31.480
but when I was actively in 2020, on Saturday morning,

00:31.480 --> 00:32.320
you know what I would do?

00:32.320 --> 00:34.600
And in 2021, Saturday morning,

00:34.600 --> 00:37.520
I would schedule a sales call for 7 a.m.

00:37.520 --> 00:38.940
That's how I wanted to start my weekend.

00:38.940 --> 00:40.960
I wanted to make dough by 8.30.

00:40.960 --> 00:43.100
I had a new credit card on file and boom,

00:43.100 --> 00:44.480
I could enjoy the weekend.

00:44.480 --> 00:47.880
I would close, I had very, very high percentage

00:47.880 --> 00:49.840
of closing on Saturday morning.

00:49.840 --> 00:52.760
So my tip is do it in the morning while they're still fresh

00:52.760 --> 00:54.380
before all the problems have,

00:54.380 --> 00:56.340
they become inundated with problems.

00:56.340 --> 01:01.360
And as a bonus, Saturdays seem to work very, very well.
