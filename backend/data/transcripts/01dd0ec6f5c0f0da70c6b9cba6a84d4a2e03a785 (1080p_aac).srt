1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,120
He or she who cares the least or he or she who appears to care the least or seems or

2
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:14,160
appears to seem like they're the most willing to walk away is the person that has control.

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,960
And if you're out of control in a deal, you're not going to get the deal.

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,840
And so if you're sitting there right now and you have a deal where someone's going to call

5
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,120
you back, it's time for the pullback.

6
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,560
If you're sitting there right now with a business owner who's not answering your calls, it's

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,560
time for the pullback.

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:32,360
If you're sitting there in a relationship and you have zero control, it's time to be

9
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,120
willing to walk.

10
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:40,240
OK, the person he or she who cares the least or appears to care the least has the control.

11
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,680
OK, and this game is about doing deals.

12
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,800
And when you want to if you want to get deals, you need to have control.

13
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,760
OK, that's it.

14
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,600
That's the pullback.
