Robert says, when are your optimal cold calling hours? Personally, mornings,

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:07,280
afternoons, evenings. So I'll tell you the times that seem like they're not the best.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:11,120
And then everything else, I feel like it's pretty similar. Times that are not the best seem to be

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,640
like Monday morning. So seem like a little bit tough because everyone's trying to like get after

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:26,160
it. And then it seems like right around like, you know, 11 to one, because something like I can never

6
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,480
tell people eat lunch. Some people eat lunch at once. Some people eat lunch like really early.

7
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:35,680
So what I would recommend is like maybe try and avoid those times. And then everything else,

8
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,240
I just kind of watch. I actually have had really good luck calling business owners on Saturdays,

9
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:45,840
like believe it or not, because they're working. The ones that are working, not all of them will

10
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,560
be, but I'll bet that most of the people that are running ads, they've got someone or they or

11
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:55,600
someone else that they are paying is going to be answering the phone. Saturday, if you call me,

12
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm talking about strategizing for my business. I'm talking about on my business, not in my

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,200
business. I've had a really good luck on Saturdays. I would just tell you the times that seem to be

14
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:09,840
hard is first thing in the morning, Mondays, and then like that 11 to one timeframe, just regular

15
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,520
days. Okay. Cause I just never know when they're doing lunch, just personal experience.
