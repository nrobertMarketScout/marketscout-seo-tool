Guys, welcome to part two of Digital Landlords.

00:10.040 --> 00:14.440
This is the section where we're going to talk about building the actual asset.

00:14.440 --> 00:18.880
We've got the deal, we've got the credit card on file, we've got the contract signed, AmEx

00:18.880 --> 00:22.880
or Visa baby, and now it's time to go and build this thing out.

00:22.880 --> 00:25.640
But a couple of things I want to mention really, really quick.

00:25.640 --> 00:34.000
And that is, number one, if you do not have your first deal, let me repeat, if you do

00:34.000 --> 00:40.220
not have your first deal, stop this video right now and go back and watch the other

00:40.220 --> 00:46.840
modules and keep doing what it talks about, the sales piece, steps one through seven again

00:46.840 --> 00:48.880
and again and again until you get your first deal.

00:48.880 --> 00:52.320
Because I do not want you playing with this stuff, I do not need you messing with this

00:52.920 --> 00:57.560
you get a deal because until you get a deal, this is nothing more than a hobby and we need

00:57.560 --> 00:58.560
to make money.

00:58.560 --> 01:01.520
So if you don't have a deal, go back and watch the modules.

01:01.520 --> 01:05.680
What happens, and the reason I'm not releasing these to people until they get their first

01:05.680 --> 01:12.800
deal, and I've been strategic about this, is because I don't want people having an excuse

01:12.800 --> 01:15.400
to not be doing sales.

01:15.400 --> 01:16.720
So if you don't have your first deal, go back.

01:16.720 --> 01:22.520
Number two, this does not take a front seat to sales.

01:22.520 --> 01:25.480
Even though we're going to be building these modules, or sorry, even though we're going

01:25.480 --> 01:29.360
to be building the sites out now, now that we've gotten the deals, and as we continue

01:29.360 --> 01:34.120
to get deals, this does not take precedence, this does not take priority.

01:34.120 --> 01:38.240
How I structure my day, how you should structure your day is you still need to be hitting sales

01:38.240 --> 01:43.500
during the golden hours, and then in the gaps, in the downtime at nights, in the afternoons

01:43.500 --> 01:48.500
when things are slow, that's when you build these websites, because we need to use our

01:48.500 --> 01:55.220
energy, our creativity, our focus to get the deals, because sales is what drives this machine.

01:55.220 --> 01:56.600
Money loves speed.

01:56.600 --> 01:58.260
Do not forget that, money loves speed.

01:58.260 --> 02:01.500
So do not let this take a front seat to sales.

02:01.500 --> 02:03.340
Sales fill takes the front seat, okay?

02:03.340 --> 02:07.780
And lastly, this is an art, not a science.

02:07.780 --> 02:09.700
This is not an exact science.

02:09.700 --> 02:13.180
Things are going to change, so at the time of recording this, I'm going to explain things

02:13.180 --> 02:19.660
as we're doing them, and as they are working as we speak, but this is an art, not a science,

02:19.660 --> 02:22.860
and so therefore, we're always going to be innovating, we're always going to be testing

02:22.860 --> 02:26.180
and tweaking and trying and everything else, and we're going to do the best that we can

02:26.180 --> 02:31.740
with the information that we have, and basically with SEO, what we look at is, okay, we've

02:31.740 --> 02:37.260
done X, Y, and Z steps for these different sites, and these different niches, and these

02:37.260 --> 02:39.380
different cities, and it's got us to rank.

02:39.380 --> 02:43.040
So we're going to keep doing it, because it's working, okay?

02:43.040 --> 02:48.560
So I'm just going to be explaining to you guys what I do from all the programs I've

02:48.560 --> 02:51.960
taken, from all the experience I have, and all the people that I've talked to, and the

02:51.960 --> 02:57.320
success that I've had with SEO, and what has worked for me in these niches, and with this

02:57.320 --> 03:02.520
specific business model, which is rank and rent, digital real estate.

03:02.520 --> 03:03.920
All right, guys, let's get into it.
