1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,560
First and foremost, I'm going to record the video.

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:14,640
Guys real quick, what I want to do this year and especially, well, not especially, but

3
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:19,560
just in general this year is I want to be, you know, we have our structured Tuesday lives.

4
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,560
I always come prepared.

5
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:26,920
I usually spend about an hour-ish preparing just for that Tuesday live.

6
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,360
But there's a lot of stuff that I learned, a lot of stuff that comes to my mind, a lot

7
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:34,520
of stuff that I'm learning as I'm trying to scale to a million dollars a month that I

8
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:40,440
think you can take and you can bring down and extract the lessons and extract the principles

9
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,880
and learn a lot.

10
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,240
Not to say that I know everything, not to say that I'm the only one that knows how to

11
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,240
do business.

12
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:48,240
In fact, I probably don't know how to do business that well at all.

13
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,400
I'm humble enough to admit that.

14
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,400
But I do want to start sharing those things with you and sometimes I have this, you know,

15
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,800
I have this big running list of like ideas of lives I want to do.

16
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,080
So I'm going to change that a little bit.

17
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:03,760
If I have something that I do or that I've learned or that's working for me, I'm just

18
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,240
going to come live and share it and then leave it.

19
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,240
And if you guys see it, great.

20
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,240
If not, no worries.

21
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,560
But I want to start doing more of that.

22
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,560
So happy Monday.

23
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:18,120
This is completely random this morning as I was, you know, I have my Monday stuff I do

24
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,640
every single Monday that it makes my entire week more productive.

25
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:25,480
I was doing that and I thought, you know what, this would be super instructive and I think

26
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,400
very important and useful for people to hear.

27
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,120
So Cindy says, can you can hear you?

28
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,120
Happy Monday.

29
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,120
Cindy, thank you.

30
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,240
And my comments are only shown up on my phone, so I'm going to be, you know, going from here

31
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,240
to here.

32
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,240
Adair, what's going on?

33
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,800
Glad to have a couple of people on, but I'm going to leave this live in the group so people

34
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,140
can see this later.

35
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,880
But really quick, what I want to share in the next like literally five, seven minutes

36
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:53,200
is something that I do every single week, specifically every single Monday that allows

37
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,200
me to get a ton of stuff done.

38
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,200
OK.

39
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:01,600
It's something that I've perfected over the years and I think it's a very it's a system

40
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,400
that's worked really well for me and I just want to share it with you.

41
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:10,920
OK, so I'm the type of person that I like to sit with my headphones on, undistracted

42
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:15,040
phone off like the one of the reasons I like being in Dubai or Africa is because I'm so

43
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,560
far ahead that by the time people can even wake up, I've already got a lot of that like,

44
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,360
you know, that important work, the working on the business, not in the business stuff.

45
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,640
I think it's very valuable where I can sit with my thoughts and solve problems and then

46
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,720
create solutions for my company.

47
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:38,360
However, sometimes I get a little bit too extreme with that and I end up like not utilizing

48
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,560
what I have, the resources that I have.

49
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,920
OK, so obviously within your business, you have different forms of leverage, right?

50
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,200
Some of like, for example, there's money is a form of leverage.

51
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,960
Media is a form of leverage and humans, human capital is a form of leverage.

52
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,440
So what I want to just share with you really quick is how I how I get a lot of stuff done

53
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,600
throughout the week.

54
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,760
Actually, I get a lot of stuff done Monday through Wednesday.

55
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,400
I get I get 90 percent of what I get done during the week, Monday through Wednesday.

56
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,960
And they're very exhausting, but very busy days, very fulfilling days.

57
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,680
But this is what I do.

58
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,480
So I want to share really quick.

59
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:18,040
OK, and maybe we may do a longer live that I can actually show you guys my screen.

60
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,480
Nick Cudlick, what's going on, dude?

61
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,200
Hopefully St. George's warming up.

62
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,320
Good to see you guys on.

63
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,280
So, guys, here's what I do.

64
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,560
Every single Sunday.

65
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,480
Now, I haven't been great at this at this this year, but it is something that I am

66
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,560
like, no questions asked.

67
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,320
I'm going to make sure that it is it is a non-negotiable for me

68
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,800
because I'm going back and looking at what were the years I did the best?

69
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,760
What's the years I grew?

70
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,560
I grew the most.

71
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,000
What's the years that I scaled the most?

72
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,040
And what was I doing?

73
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,240
OK, one of the things was I was very, very adamant about month

74
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,200
weekly planning on Sunday and specifically early in the morning

75
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,000
before kids were up, before church, before any of that kind of stuff.

76
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,080
I was very, very disciplined about getting my planning done.

77
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,520
OK. Now, what it does, guys, when you get your plan.

78
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,040
By the way, this isn't a planning topic I'm talking about.

79
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,440
But when you do that weekly planning, first thing in the morning,

80
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,680
you know, when you're thinking, hey, I got to do my planning at 630 a.m.,

81
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,560
it doesn't really encourage you or inspire you to go out on Saturday night.

82
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,880
Right. That's one thing that I've learned.

83
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,000
You get to bed a little bit earlier.

84
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,200
You start thinking, hey, I got to get up.

85
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,480
I got to get that done. OK.

86
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,560
I like to do it in the morning because by the evening, I'm tired.

87
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,040
My creativity is gone.

88
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:25,520
And on top of that, you know, it's like I, you know, I want to be

89
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,240
I want to give myself a chance to reset.

90
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,680
So first thing that I do, guys, is Sunday morning.

91
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,760
I plan out my entire week.

92
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,000
I have a live that I've done in this group on my weekly planning,

93
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,880
how I do my weekly planning, which you guys can go and you can find.

94
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,920
You can check out. OK. So do that on Monday.

95
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,880
Sorry. On Sunday, Monday, what I do is I set aside an hour.

96
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,360
OK. And sometimes I break it up into 30 minute chunks.

97
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,160
I'll do like 30 minutes. I'll take a five minute break.

98
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,480
I'll do the other 30 minutes.

99
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:53,000
But what I do, guys, is I have all of the human capital

100
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,480
that I have access to, OK, which is my team. Right.

101
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:02,640
So just some of the people you guys know, Francesca, Ashley, I've got

102
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,000
Isaac, who is my video guy, I've got Porter.

103
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,640
These are members of my team.

104
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,120
This is my human capital for you guys.

105
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,920
You may have your VA.

106
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,880
You may have your content writer, whatever, whatever, whatever. Right.

107
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,280
And for me, just so you guys know, I also have

108
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,080
my team members that report to me that have their own team members

109
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,560
that report to them, which is another layer of leverage.

110
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:30,280
So what I do is I have a simple Google document and I title it

111
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:35,080
2025 weekly priorities and I put the name of the person.

112
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,720
So 2025 weekly priorities, Ashley.

113
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,880
OK. 2025 weekly priorities, Isaac.

114
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,720
And guys, what I do is I go and I look at my weekly plan

115
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,440
and I sit there and I go, what things I look at my top three.

116
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,080
I, you know, my big three that I do, and you guys have to watch my weekly

117
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,600
planning live to understand what I'm talking about.

118
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,840
But I look at my big three things I want to accomplish.

119
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,320
And then I look at all my other tasks and I look and say,

120
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,960
what can I get off of my plate, but still keep moving the needle forward?

121
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,680
And there's things that I personally have to do.

122
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,360
I have to record a podcast.

123
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,880
I can't really outsource that because I'm the one doing it. Right.

124
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,800
But I can outsource the planning.

125
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,160
I can outsource maybe not even the planning, but I can outsource the

126
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,600
the production and the schedule of the post and the commenting

127
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,800
and making sure all of everything's dialed in and editing that I can do.

128
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,840
So I look at my weekly priorities and my weekly planning.

129
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,320
And I'm going to start assigning stuff to different people. Right.

130
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,800
Ashley, this is this falls under her role.

131
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,440
This falls under Francesca's role.

132
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,800
This falls under Porter. This falls under Jason.

133
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,120
This falls under, you know, my guy, Peter here in Africa.

134
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:42,640
And I start divvying this stuff out and I put it into two categories.

135
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:46,560
OK. First category I do is stuff that they need to work on.

136
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,600
It's like creative juices.

137
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,560
I need you to put your this is this is the priorities,

138
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,600
the stuff that actually takes, you know, brain power and creativity.

139
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,720
That comes first.

140
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,960
And then underneath that, I call it the managerial stuff.

141
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,160
That's hey, I need you to reschedule a flight for me.

142
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,400
I need you to make sure this is posted stuff that doesn't take a lot of time.

143
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,600
I need you to respond to the Facebook or the YouTube comments,

144
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,720
stuff that doesn't really take a lot of thought, but that needs to be done.

145
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
So each one of my team members, I have two different categories.

146
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,480
I have my creative needle moving stuff and then I have my managerial stuff.

147
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:25,000
And I go and I line them out every single week on Monday.

148
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,880
First thing that I do, exactly the things that are priorities.

149
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,240
And as long as I've communicated the goals of the company,

150
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,880
the way the direction that I want to move as a company and the vision for the company

151
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,440
and then they can see the weekly priorities, I can then go.

152
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,200
And as soon as I've done that, what I'll do, you know, once they wake up

153
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:47,360
or once I get a chance is I'll hop on with them for, you know, five, 10, 15 minutes.

154
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,320
Like as soon as I get off this, I'm about to hop on with Francesca.

155
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,040
I'm going to hop on with her.

156
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,480
We're going to buzz through it really quick.

157
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,560
And I'm going to clarify anything that she may have a question on

158
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,920
or anything that I want to make sure she really understands.

159
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,520
And then she goes to work.

160
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,320
So for all of Monday, for Monday at 9am for the whole week,

161
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,760
she's completely lined out and she's on her freaking business.

162
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,440
She's doing the task. She knows what's important.

163
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,000
She knows she needs to spend her time.

164
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,080
And then also, guys, there's Francesca calling me right now.

165
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:17,160
I'm also, well, I then I can go back to work on the stuff

166
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,800
because I have two different categories.

167
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,200
I have the stuff that's needle moving and creative, et cetera.

168
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,160
And then I have the managerial stuff that's like, get the tax paper here.

169
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,480
The only sign this that only I can do.

170
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:31,840
And then, hey, let's figure out how we can come up with more clients in a one week period.

171
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,520
Let's figure out how we can create better lives.

172
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,640
Let's figure out we can redo this training.

173
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,960
Those are my needle moving activities.

174
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,720
And so, guys, I do this every single week.

175
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,760
I line them out in their Google sheet.

176
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,960
I try to do a quick phone call, a quick Zoom call with them.

177
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,240
Some of the team members that it's really cut and dry do this, this, this and this.

178
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,560
It's a lot of the same stuff every week.

179
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,520
I don't need to do it.

180
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,560
And sometimes and some of the people I have to get on a Zoom like Francesca,

181
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,280
who keeps calling me, by the way.

182
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,600
She's like, where are you at?

183
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,040
And I make sure that we're on the same page.

184
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,000
And guys, by doing this, you're duplicating yourself.

185
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,120
You are then lining your team members out.

186
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,920
It's like you're programming.

187
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,000
I don't want to say a robot, but you're programming human capital

188
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,800
that you're like, hey, do this, this, this and this.

189
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:16,320
And you also have a very, you know, creative and strong brain.

190
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,760
And these are my team members are really, really smart.

191
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,680
Otherwise, they wouldn't be on my team.

192
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,000
I wouldn't allow them to be on my team.

193
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,280
And then they get to go and work on the stuff

194
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,440
that is going to move the needle in those departments.

195
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,920
And then guess what? On Friday, they send me a quick loom.

196
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,440
If we don't zoom and they say, hey, here was this priority.

197
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,200
Here's what I did. Here was this five minute loom.

198
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,480
Put it on to speed.

199
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,280
Watch it in two minutes. Done.

200
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,960
This right here, guys, is something that I do every single week.

201
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,200
So I've already done my weekly priorities for all my team members,

202
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,920
my human capital.

203
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,600
Now I got to do a couple of zooms and check in with them.

204
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,600
And then I'll be checking in on Slack and stuff midweek.

205
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,120
And then by the end of the week, we either do a quick phone call, zoom,

206
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,400
or they send me a loom via email.

207
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,520
Everyone on my team member sends me a loom on email or Slack.

208
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,280
I then Monday morning or when I'm planning, I watch it quickly.

209
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,920
I'm like, boom, they got everything done.

210
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,880
And on to the next week, guys, this has allowed me to get a lot of stuff done

211
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,080
leveraging human capital, which is something you're already paying for.

212
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,440
If you're not taking the time to line up your VA and tell them

213
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,800
exactly what they should be spending their time doing and the priorities

214
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,640
that they should be, you know, the things they should be prioritizing.

215
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,200
You're leaving a lot of money on the table.

216
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,480
And there's a lot of stuff that could be getting done that's not.

217
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:24,400
OK, so that said, guys, in lieu or in the same vein of what I'm talking about,

218
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,600
I'm going to hop on with Francesca.

219
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,320
We're going to go over our priorities and I'm going to keep cranking out work, guys.

220
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,080
Happy freaking January.

221
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,200
It's one of the greatest months to do deals.

222
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,360
And I will see you guys tomorrow on the live.

223
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,160
I'm out. See you guys.
