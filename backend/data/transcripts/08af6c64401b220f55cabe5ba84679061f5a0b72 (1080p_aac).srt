00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
OK, Martin says, are most business owners on Angie's

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,760
home advisor paying for leads?

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,600
I thought only it says sponsored or verified.

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,680
Yes, well, it depends.

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,080
Not all, not all are on.

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,800
And that's why I prefer Google ads.

7
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,840
Somebody's paying for Google ads.

8
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:14,640
You see, it says sponsored.

9
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,920
That means they're currently paying.

10
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,840
Home advisor angels doesn't necessarily mean they're paying.

11
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,120
So what I'll do is I've in my head, I'm assuming they're not.

12
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,240
I'm assuming they maybe got verified and they were paying.

13
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,680
But you know, the annoying thing with home advisor,

14
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,520
they can turn it off, they can turn it on.

15
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,640
So I assume that they're not.

16
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,800
But I still in my head, I'm like, at one point,

17
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,880
they went through the process of getting on home advisor

18
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,960
and they might still be paying.

19
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,520
So I would prefer they're paying for Google ads.

20
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,760
But no, that doesn't always mean that they're currently paying.
