1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
Dude, tell me about a deal that you've done,

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,520
a pitch you've been on, a Zoom close that you didn't close

3
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,040
and what the business owner said.

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,040
All right, so just so you know,

5
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:12,480
I've had five Zoom closes and I'm closed four of those.

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,280
So it's just been one.

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,360
Hey, all flex, all flex.

8
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,280
I like it, I like it.

9
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,240
Bro, you said you have to flex, so why not?

10
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,600
Dude, I love it, bro.

11
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,560
I wanna see more fucking posts is what I'm saying.

12
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:24,880
Let's go.

13
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:25,840
For sure, dude.

14
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,680
Hey, hit me though.

15
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,920
Hit me with the one you didn't close.

16
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,000
The one that I lost was,

17
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,840
they told me at the end of the call

18
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,920
that they had to talk to their spouse.

19
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:34,760
Okay.

20
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,480
And so I gave them until the next day,

21
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,880
until like around noon.

22
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,240
And then I called them, didn't answer.

23
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,360
And then we started going this back and forth

24
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,440
where he would shoot me a text.

25
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,960
He's like, yeah, call me later, blah, blah, blah.

26
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,880
I would call him and it didn't happen.

27
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,840
And I just ended up getting another business owner

28
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,680
and closing him.

29
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,640
So, but yeah, he just never got back to me.

30
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,120
So that one, was it the spouse or partner

31
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,600
or was the spouse a partner?

32
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,720
Or was like spouse partner or spouse spouse?

33
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,360
Like not involved in the business.

34
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,320
Spouse, spouse.

35
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,080
Yeah, that's a tough one because,

36
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,320
dude, the thing with those is like,

37
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,080
this is the pitch that they got, right?

38
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,880
So he got the phone with you.

39
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,800
He goes to his wife and he goes,

40
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,160
hey honey, there's this guy, he's in North Carolina.

41
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:22,360
He wants to do leads and it's 1500 bucks a month flat rate.

42
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,120
She's like, fuck no.

43
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,240
She has no involvement in the business.

44
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,920
She wasn't on the call, so you're fucked, right?

45
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,000
So the only thing I would say,

46
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,560
like this is an easy one in the sense that like,

47
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,840
you just gotta make sure upfront that you let them know

48
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,040
that if there's a decision maker

49
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,240
that needs to be on the call other than them

50
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,080
to get them on the call, okay?

51
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,920
Yeah.

52
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,760
That's the only way.

53
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:52,280
Cause dude, overcoming that shit is really difficult

54
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,160
because like that person doesn't even know

55
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,680
what's going on in the business anyway.

56
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,520
Makes sense?

57
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,120
So here's one thing that I've been doing

58
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,200
and a lot of you guys, I think even probably you,

59
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,440
do you remember the video I sent you

60
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,440
before we jumped on the call?

61
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,720
Yeah, that's what I've been doing.

62
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,880
Like when I send over the screencast right when I end it,

63
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,920
I say, you know, just make sure if there's anybody else

64
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,720
that has to be on the call, bring them on.

65
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,640
That's what I say.

66
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,120
And since then I've had no issues with that objection

67
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,280
or it hasn't come up.

68
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,240
So you did, you started doing that after you lost that deal.

69
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,200
Correct.

70
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,400
That's beautiful.

71
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,400
So all of you guys that are on,

72
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,240
all of you guys that are listening,

73
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,920
that's something I do and I'm showing you an example.

74
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,680
Like the thing is, I know if you're jumping on the call

75
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,800
to talk about FFM, it's probably a good fit.

76
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,320
Like you've seen the videos, you want to grow,

77
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,160
but guess what?

78
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,440
People get weird, people get nervous,

79
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,400
people do all these things.

80
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,560
So I don't want that to be an objection.

81
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,440
So I send that video out and you guys know,

82
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,080
I kind of made an over exaggeration

83
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,960
if you need to bring your dog, your goldfish,

84
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,480
your spouse or Jesus, bring them to the call

85
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,960
because I ain't doing, I want to think about it bullshit.

86
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,560
So you can say it a lot less confrontational,

87
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,480
but nonetheless, it's the same concept.

88
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,440
So I like that weaving it into the pre-closed screencast

89
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,520
is brilliant, dude.

90
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,040
I love that.

91
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,160
It's exactly what I do.

92
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,160
And it's also part of the training.

93
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,280
It's like, the other thing too,

94
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,760
is while you're doing the calls and the leads,

95
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,040
you could also, hey, so is it just you

96
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,000
or is it your partner?

97
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,520
Like, do you have a partner?

98
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,920
Is your spouse involved?

99
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,760
But I would definitely say,

100
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,400
is there anyone else that needs to be involved

101
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,360
like in this decision?

102
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,760
And you can, instead of being like,

103
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,640
making it like a lot of buying pressure,

104
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:39,080
just say, look, man, I don't want to play telephone

105
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,560
where I tell you everything.

106
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,800
You got to go to your wife or your partner

107
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,440
and then half of it's missing.

108
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,280
And then it's like,

109
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,680
I don't want to have to pitch this twice.

110
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,280
So get them on the call.

111
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,480
And literally when you jump on, say, hey, so we're good.

112
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,440
Like there's no one else who needs to be on this call.

113
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,280
Okay, cool.

114
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,160
And if they say, yes, cool, we're rescheduling this bitch

115
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,960
because I ain't going to do this twice.

116
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,720
But dude, it sounds like you already knew the answer

117
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,640
but I'm really glad you came on to tell everyone.

118
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,040
And that's definitely something you guys

119
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,160
should be incorporating at the end of your Zoom close

120
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,200
or your screencast just to mention,

121
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,160
hey, if there's anybody else, get them on the call.

122
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,520
And if that means we need to reschedule, I'm okay with it

123
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,360
but it's going to be way more beneficial for both of us

124
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,560
to get them on the call.

125
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,240
Yeah, can I say one last thing before I get off?

126
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,560
Please, please, please.

127
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,720
So usually what I've done and I did the same thing

128
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,680
with that person that I lost the deal with

129
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,680
was when I'm sending over the leads,

130
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,720
whenever I get on the phone with them

131
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,160
and I feel like they're not that busy

132
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,880
and they have a couple of minutes to talk

133
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,280
and I ask them all the questions about your closing rate,

134
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,400
your profit margin, right there I incorporate that question

135
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,520
of like, are you the sole decision maker?

136
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,200
Do you have like any other partners or whatever?

137
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,720
And so with that person, I did the same

138
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,720
but I didn't bring it up on the screencast, right?

139
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,720
And last thing I'll say, dude,

140
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,000
is I couldn't agree more with you

141
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,640
when it comes to the entire setup.

142
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,800
And the reason why I say that was

143
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,520
the last deal that I closed, this guy has a partner.

144
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,960
They run a concrete company.

145
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,040
They do about $3 million a year.

146
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,400
So he obviously has partners and nobody came on the call.

147
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,560
It was just him.

148
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,680
And it was the easiest sale of my life.

149
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,520
And why?

150
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,680
Because of the setup, because I did it properly.

151
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,200
So as long as you do the setup correctly,

152
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,720
you're gonna get the deal, man.

153
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,320
So that's what I wanted to say.
