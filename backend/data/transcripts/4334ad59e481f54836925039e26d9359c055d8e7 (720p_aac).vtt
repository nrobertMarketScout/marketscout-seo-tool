Do you leverage your initial leads to multiple business owners to get more of them on the hook?

00:03.840 --> 00:07.280
So Rudy, I've done, I've kind of tried both ways.

00:07.280 --> 00:12.960
I prefer to stick with one business owner because again, remember what I said to

00:12.960 --> 00:17.280
Jean or yeah, to Jeannie said, talk about retention, which by the way, Eugene or sorry,

00:17.280 --> 00:21.200
Jean, your issue, you need to get these guys in a contract.

00:21.200 --> 00:23.680
I think that's going to solve a lot of problems because if they're month to month,

00:23.680 --> 00:26.160
there's no commitment. There is zero commitment. Okay.

00:26.160 --> 00:31.520
I do a six month contract and it's a 30 day notice of cancellation type of thing.

00:31.520 --> 00:37.520
So it's like, yeah. So Rudy, I don't like sharing them with other people.

00:37.520 --> 00:41.280
I like to give them to one company because again, it comes back to this.

00:41.280 --> 00:43.040
If I can get a business owner to make money,

00:44.080 --> 00:48.160
I know I'm going to close that business owner. Like I better close that business owner.

00:48.160 --> 00:54.400
So I prefer to just give two or three leads to one person and just focus on that one person.

00:54.400 --> 00:56.800
What I found is when you start sharing the leads, like this guy gets it,

00:56.800 --> 00:59.520
this guy gets it, this guy gets it, and you kind of do the round robin,

00:59.520 --> 01:04.800
the lead gets overwhelmed. The lead's like, what is this? They're confused.

01:04.800 --> 01:09.600
And the person that closes the job might not be the person that you want to work with.

01:09.600 --> 01:12.960
So I like to just find the person I want to work with, hook them up,

01:12.960 --> 01:16.560
make them money and make it work. Okay. That's just my two cents. You can.

01:16.560 --> 01:18.400
I've done it not on purpose. I have done that before.
