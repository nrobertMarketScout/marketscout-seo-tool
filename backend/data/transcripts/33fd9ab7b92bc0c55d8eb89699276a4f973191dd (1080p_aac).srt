Jerry says, if you do not, if you do comment on quote, not so

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,920
niche relevant websites, but with good metrics, can it somehow

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,880
backfire and make uncle Google confused about what topic your

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,400
website really is about? What are your thoughts on that,

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:14,880
Eugene?

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,800
I mean, like, like I said, you know, we're, we're really, we're

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,000
really at a very, no, I wouldn't, I wouldn't say that.

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,380
No, I mean, I think Google is smart enough at this point to

9
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:29,880
know like what your content is. And, you know, I've seen like,

10
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,520
probably thousands of websites getting backlinks this kind of

11
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,200
like this way, right? So like, I don't, you know, I don't think

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,520
that's going to be issue. The only issue is, it's really just

13
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,040
going to be like, it's not going to be as effective as if you can

14
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:48,120
get a relevant backlink from a good website, right? But, but

15
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,560
yeah, I mean, we do it all the time. And, you know, we don't

16
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:56,080
have any penalty problems or miss indexing problems or

17
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:56,800
anything like that.

18
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,080
I think it's more if you get the relevancy, it's going to help.

19
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,200
If you don't, it's not going to help, but it's not going to hurt

20
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,680
you, because I know how I would look at it.
