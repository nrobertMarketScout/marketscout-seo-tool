1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
rewatch module one and you're going to have to learn that this is, it's honestly more of like a

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,920
gut feeling. There's not going to be specific things they're necessarily going to say. Sometimes

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:15,440
there will be, sometimes they'll say something, but most of the time it's what they're not saying

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,480
or they're just being too agreeable. Like I remember somebody posted a video in here of them

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:27,520
doing a hook, right? And the person just kept saying, yeah, that sounds good. Yeah. Okay. Cool.

6
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,400
Sounds good. And it was like, they just kept saying yes, because it was easier than saying no.

7
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,200
So it's more Nick, when you're listening to this, go watch module one, rewatch it.

8
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:45,520
I'm sorry, not module one, module four, go watch, go rewatch module four and, and do that. But the

9
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,440
other thing is I'll guarantee that this could solve 99% of your problems. Nick is just start making it

10
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,440
a habit. When you get to the end of that call and they sound interested and they keep going along

11
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:02,160
with you, do this, do the pullback. Hey, look, man, just want to double check, like happy to send

12
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,320
you a lead or two for free, but if that's all you're looking for, I'll still send it to you,

13
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,640
but I just want to be candid with you. I am looking to partner with somebody. So I just

14
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,080
want to make sure we're going to be good to talk in a couple of days. Is that cool? And if they,

15
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,000
if at that point you're giving them an out and if they're like, well, actually I'm actually pretty

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,800
busy, like, like double commit them, pull back. Like I don't care if you don't want to talk,

17
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:29,840
just tell me I'm a big boy. I'm a big girl. I don't need you to just, you know, kiss my

18
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:35,600
ass. Tell me the truth. So that, I think Nick, the real question here, I know what you're dealing

19
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:41,200
with. Start doing the pullback every single time and you're going to start, you're going to start

20
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,480
getting the not serious people out. And maybe these people, some of these are serious, but just

21
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:52,720
because of the, you're acting timid to ask that question. Um, they're, they're just going along

22
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,880
with you and then they're, they're kind of pushing them away. So try that. I think that

23
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,080
will solve a lot of your problems.
