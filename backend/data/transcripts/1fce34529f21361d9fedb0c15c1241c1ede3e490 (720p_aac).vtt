00:00.000 --> 00:03.720
Okay, guys, let's do this.

00:03.720 --> 00:04.720
Let's get into some Q&A.

00:04.720 --> 00:06.360
Moin, I got you in the waiting room.

00:06.360 --> 00:07.360
You're first up.

00:07.360 --> 00:09.740
What I'm going to do before I do that, I'm going to see if there's any quick questions

00:09.740 --> 00:14.080
I can answer on the post since those came in first.

00:14.080 --> 00:19.200
By the way, okay, let me just start with newest or I'm going to say all comments.

00:19.200 --> 00:20.200
Let's see what we got here.

00:20.200 --> 00:23.280
And I appreciate you guys posting the word king on the post.

00:23.280 --> 00:28.880
It keeps that post kind of trending towards the top and then more people can see it, okay?

00:28.880 --> 00:31.320
Let's see if we got any quick answers real quick.

00:31.320 --> 00:37.480
Shiju, your question is super long, which I can check out here just a second, but I'm

00:37.480 --> 00:39.680
going to see if I can knock out any quick ones.

00:39.680 --> 00:42.480
I don't see the link, Daniel.

00:42.480 --> 00:44.820
Hopefully he found it.

00:44.820 --> 00:45.820
We are live.

00:45.820 --> 00:47.680
Did you see it?

00:47.680 --> 00:50.120
Okay, that's the only question I see on there.

00:50.120 --> 00:53.840
So that said, I'm going to bring Moin on.

00:53.840 --> 00:59.320
And also, guys, if you want, you're free to put questions in the chat as well, okay?

00:59.320 --> 01:00.320
Here comes Moin.

01:00.320 --> 01:16.800
Okay, Moin, can you hear me, bro?

01:16.800 --> 01:17.800
There we go.

01:17.800 --> 01:18.800
Yeah.

01:18.800 --> 01:19.800
What's up, dude?

01:19.800 --> 01:20.800
Yeah, can you hear me?

01:21.800 --> 01:24.000
Yeah, can you hear me?

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
I sure can.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.920
And by the way, Luke, I think that's Luke Prichard.

01:26.920 --> 01:27.920
You're next.

01:27.920 --> 01:28.920
Hang in there waiting for me.

01:28.920 --> 01:35.920
But Moin, what's your question, brother?

01:35.920 --> 01:46.400
Moin, I can hear you clicking around like you're stealing someone's identity over there,

01:46.400 --> 01:47.400
bro.

01:47.400 --> 01:48.400
I know you're on.

01:48.400 --> 01:49.400
Can you hear me?

01:49.400 --> 01:50.400
Yeah, yeah, I can hear you.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
What's your question, dude?

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
Let's go.

01:53.000 --> 01:58.400
Yeah, so, like, you know, like, my question is, like, about Google Ads.

01:58.400 --> 02:04.520
So, like, how, you know, like, important is it in the process of, you know, of this process?

02:04.520 --> 02:09.320
Like, does it start with Google Ads, or is there any other way to do it?

02:09.320 --> 02:11.960
Yeah, so it's up to you, guys.

02:11.960 --> 02:17.200
I personally prefer using Google Ads because I like to pre-sell my sites.

02:17.200 --> 02:21.480
I like to go and get that deal up front.

02:21.480 --> 02:28.200
However, like, there's the other way to do it, which is the traditional way.

02:28.200 --> 02:32.720
I call it the traditional way, which is where you go, you pick a city, you pick a niche,

02:32.720 --> 02:35.880
you rank the website, then you go and sell it.

02:35.880 --> 02:42.320
So if you're somebody, let's say you don't have a lot of capital and you're nervous to

02:42.320 --> 02:47.120
spend money on ads, you know, I still would argue it's better to go get the deal up front,

02:47.120 --> 02:50.440
but maybe you're not confident in your ability to sell it, whatever, and that's what you

02:50.440 --> 02:51.440
want to do.

02:51.440 --> 02:52.440
That is fine.

02:52.440 --> 02:55.520
If you want, you could start at the second half of the training, build a website, rank

02:55.520 --> 03:00.640
it, and then go and start using the first half of the training to sell the deal.

03:00.640 --> 03:02.840
So you can do it either way.

03:02.840 --> 03:09.520
I just prefer going into it and getting paid while the website's ranking.

03:10.400 --> 03:15.960
Okay, so when you're running Google ads, like, you know, like, do you do test out like three,

03:15.960 --> 03:21.800
four sites or sites or properties, or you just run with one and then, you know, see

03:21.800 --> 03:27.960
if it is validated or you just stop it or you continue, you know, sell it off.

03:27.960 --> 03:32.840
So how do you start with three, four properties at the same time?

03:32.960 --> 03:40.440
When you first start, I would recommend starting with one, but once you get going and you've

03:40.440 --> 03:44.200
gotten that first deal, you can start adding two, and then once you figure that out, you

03:44.200 --> 03:45.200
can start adding three.

03:45.200 --> 03:50.400
And then what I do is once one website, one ad starts to really work, I start to get leads,

03:50.400 --> 03:54.480
then I pause the other two and I focus on the one and so forth.

03:54.480 --> 03:59.840
So when you first start, you probably want to start with one.

03:59.840 --> 04:00.840
Got it?

04:00.840 --> 04:01.840
Okay.

04:02.280 --> 04:03.560
Let's go get a deal, brother.

04:03.560 --> 04:09.640
You also, one thing I want to remind you of, make sure that you're focusing on asking people

04:09.640 --> 04:13.680
for money, because no matter what you do, no matter how much content you do, no matter

04:13.680 --> 04:18.040
how many backlinks you do, no matter how many websites you look at, unless you're asking

04:18.040 --> 04:20.480
people for money, you're not going to make money.

04:20.480 --> 04:21.480
Make sense?

04:21.480 --> 04:22.480
Yeah.

04:22.480 --> 04:23.480
Yeah.

04:23.480 --> 04:24.480
So, awesome.

04:24.480 --> 04:26.600
Well, Moin, thanks for helping out, brother.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.800
We'll talk soon and let's go get a deal, dude.

04:32.240 --> 04:33.240
All right.

04:33.240 --> 04:34.240
Moin is out.

04:34.240 --> 04:36.560
Let's get Luke in here.

04:36.560 --> 04:37.560
Good question.

04:37.560 --> 04:39.560
Let's see what Luke's got.

04:48.840 --> 04:50.560
Okay, Luke, I cannot hear you.

04:50.560 --> 04:51.560
It says it's connecting to audio.

04:51.560 --> 04:54.560
Oh, I think it's connected.

04:54.560 --> 04:56.560
There we go.

04:56.560 --> 04:57.560
What's up, bro?

04:57.560 --> 04:58.560
What's going on, Nick?

04:58.560 --> 04:59.560
How you doing, man?

05:00.280 --> 05:03.280
Hey, I'm about to get a hurricane up in here.

05:03.280 --> 05:05.200
So just enjoying the sunshine.

05:05.200 --> 05:07.000
I love that, dude.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.520
Don't waste, you know, never, what do they say?

05:09.520 --> 05:14.400
Never waste a good tragedy or a good opportunity like that.

05:14.400 --> 05:15.400
Exactly.

05:15.400 --> 05:20.760
Dude, one of my best years, 2018, I was in this niche called, I don't recommend this

05:20.760 --> 05:25.600
niche by the way, but at the time I was in basement waterproofing and, dude, it was the

05:25.600 --> 05:28.280
best time ever because all the basements flooded.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
Yeah, I know, man.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.120
I got a GMB for foundation repair.

05:33.120 --> 05:34.680
I think it's going to get really active.

05:34.680 --> 05:35.680
Oh, yeah.

05:35.680 --> 05:36.680
A hundred percent, man.

05:36.680 --> 05:38.760
So where are you at right now?

05:38.760 --> 05:39.760
I'm in Jacksonville.

05:39.760 --> 05:40.760
Beautiful.

05:40.760 --> 05:42.760
Shout out to these hurricanes, bro.

05:42.760 --> 05:43.760
Yeah, I know, man.

05:43.760 --> 05:44.760
It's going to get crazy.

05:44.760 --> 05:47.760
So, yeah, dude, what's your question, man?

05:47.760 --> 05:51.760
So, no, honestly, the course is amazing, Digital Landlords.

05:51.760 --> 05:55.000
I wish I'd been putting more time into it.

05:55.000 --> 05:59.920
I'm so busy with SEO clients and they take up so much of my time.

05:59.920 --> 06:02.560
I keep putting out fires every single day.

06:02.560 --> 06:07.400
I just want to give a big shout out to you, but also want to ask you, would you recommend

06:07.400 --> 06:13.040
kind of burning the boats and ditching some of these clients in order to free up more

06:13.040 --> 06:17.160
time or do you have any recommendations for outsourcing?

06:17.160 --> 06:24.520
So I definitely, like when I started scaling, first of all, is this, it's kind of a contextual

06:24.520 --> 06:29.160
question because if you need it to pay the bills and it's keeping you out of your job,

06:29.160 --> 06:30.960
then that's one thing.

06:30.960 --> 06:35.680
But I also know that it could be the thing that's causing you not to scale because your

06:35.680 --> 06:38.260
attention is definitely going to be split.

06:38.260 --> 06:43.060
What I did, again, this is just from experience, is in 2020 when I started scaling is I found

06:43.060 --> 06:44.320
a strategic partner.

06:44.320 --> 06:46.460
I created the strategic partner.

06:46.460 --> 06:49.200
It was my employee that was doing my SEO.

06:49.200 --> 06:50.760
He started a company.

06:50.760 --> 06:52.440
We did a 50-50 split.

06:52.440 --> 06:53.440
He would sign the deal.

06:53.440 --> 06:54.440
I'd sign the deals.

06:54.440 --> 06:55.440
I'd send them to him.

06:55.440 --> 06:56.440
I wouldn't talk to the client again.

06:56.440 --> 06:59.200
He would pay me 50% of the net profit.

06:59.200 --> 07:04.360
That allowed me to keep some of the money, but also just to focus strictly on lead generation.

07:04.360 --> 07:06.520
So that's what I did.

07:06.520 --> 07:07.880
It worked out really, really well.

07:07.880 --> 07:13.160
I still was able to make about, and every time I use, I say I made 100K a month.

07:13.160 --> 07:15.160
I hope you guys know that was just with lead gen.

07:15.160 --> 07:19.160
This was, when I talked SEO, that was just like gravy.

07:19.760 --> 07:25.160
We were doing like 7,000 to 12,000 a month, my split of SEO, which means I could have

07:25.160 --> 07:30.240
taken 20 if I would have done it myself, but I just decided, I could have taken 15 to 20,

07:30.240 --> 07:33.720
but I decided I'm going to take half of that focus on lead gen because that's where I could

07:33.720 --> 07:34.720
actually scale.

07:34.720 --> 07:39.080
So that's what I would recommend as far as outsourcing.

07:39.080 --> 07:42.880
I don't really have anyone that I've used that I would recommend.

07:42.880 --> 07:45.400
I can ask around and get that for you.

07:45.400 --> 07:51.360
It's just difficult when you're doing white labeling because people do the bare minimum.

07:51.360 --> 07:55.440
They just want to get paid and they don't really care, but you can shoot me a message

07:55.440 --> 08:01.960
and maybe there's some kind of a way you could even use my team.

08:01.960 --> 08:05.240
I don't know, but yes, if you want to send me a message, I'm happy to do that, man.

08:05.240 --> 08:06.240
All right, man.

08:06.240 --> 08:07.240
You have a good one.

08:07.240 --> 08:08.240
Bro, appreciate you hopping on.

08:08.240 --> 08:09.560
Hey, good luck with the hurricane.

08:09.560 --> 08:13.520
If you could, get us some good photos for the websites, dude.

08:13.520 --> 08:15.720
Let's get some storm damage.

08:15.720 --> 08:16.720
Yeah, maybe.

08:16.720 --> 08:17.720
That's a good one.

08:17.720 --> 08:18.720
All right.

08:18.720 --> 08:19.720
I'll try my best.

08:19.720 --> 08:20.720
Hey, good to talk to you, man.

08:20.720 --> 08:21.720
We'll talk soon.

08:21.720 --> 08:22.720
Later, Nick.

08:22.720 --> 08:23.720
See you, my boy.

08:23.720 --> 08:27.760
Okay, guys, good questions so far.

08:27.760 --> 08:31.640
Let's see if I got anything else cooking in the chat.

08:31.640 --> 08:35.560
Okay, let's see.

08:35.560 --> 08:36.560
What else?

08:36.560 --> 08:37.560
I'm going to go to Robert really quick.

08:37.560 --> 08:39.640
Robert said he's got clicks, but no phone calls.

08:39.640 --> 08:40.640
Can you assist?

08:41.480 --> 08:49.000
One thing I would love to just try and just reiterate that something that I've tried to

08:49.000 --> 08:54.040
really focus on is try to just, whenever you have an issue in your business, try to just

08:54.040 --> 08:59.560
use your intuition and think, okay, and by the way, this goes for anything.

08:59.560 --> 09:03.400
If your business owners aren't closing, but you're getting a bunch of people to a closing

09:03.400 --> 09:06.280
call, then you could use the same exact logic, okay?

09:06.280 --> 09:10.600
But with this situation, you're like, okay, I'm getting clicks, but no phone calls.

09:10.880 --> 09:16.200
That means that people are clicking on my ads and I'm getting no phone calls.

09:16.200 --> 09:19.960
Well, then you start kind of digging deeper, you go, all right, well, assuming that these

09:19.960 --> 09:24.680
people are visiting my website, then that would mean that I'm either getting the wrong

09:24.680 --> 09:34.720
people to my website because they're not ready to buy, they're not ready to call for an estimate,

09:34.720 --> 09:36.120
so that could be number one.

09:36.120 --> 09:41.960
The other thing is I have the right people, but my landing page isn't converting, right?

09:41.960 --> 09:46.040
So that's what you have to look at and you have to kind of be logical about it, okay?

09:46.040 --> 09:50.920
So what I would recommend is there's a couple of different things that you can do.

09:52.720 --> 09:58.760
If you have an idea that maybe your website's not converting, you can go, there's a software

09:58.760 --> 10:02.640
called Hotjar, you can install Hotjar on your, and there's other ones too, but you can install

10:02.680 --> 10:07.080
Hotjar on your website, you can track and look at what people, you know, when they come

10:07.080 --> 10:09.800
to the page, what are they doing, are they scrolling below the fold, are they doing this,

10:09.800 --> 10:10.800
are they doing that, whatever.

10:11.400 --> 10:12.200
So that's an idea.

10:12.200 --> 10:18.400
If you think it's a conversion issue, if you think it's maybe the wrong type of customer

10:18.400 --> 10:21.960
or you think they're clicking on the ad and they're not going to the website, for example,

10:21.960 --> 10:25.720
I know sometimes I used to think it was my competitors, maybe you could go and you could

10:25.720 --> 10:29.720
track, you could set up your analytics, you could see, are you getting, you know, how

10:29.720 --> 10:31.320
much traffic are you actually getting?

10:31.320 --> 10:32.160
Is it increasing?

10:32.160 --> 10:34.520
Is it lining up with how many clicks you're getting?

10:34.880 --> 10:38.160
And you just kind of have to dissect it from there and you just have to do a process of

10:38.160 --> 10:38.760
elimination.

10:38.760 --> 10:44.120
But if you guys are using the core keywords, you guys are following the training, most

10:44.120 --> 10:47.720
likely you have the right traffic going to your website, which means that you have a

10:47.720 --> 10:54.720
conversion issue, which then I would go, hey, is your website, you know, something that's

10:54.720 --> 10:56.400
actually converting, is it user friendly?

10:56.400 --> 10:58.400
Is it something that is scaring people off?

10:58.400 --> 11:00.160
Is the number easy to find?

11:00.160 --> 11:01.600
Is the quote form easy to find?

11:01.600 --> 11:04.680
Or are you burying the stuff at the bottom, making it difficult?

11:04.680 --> 11:06.680
So you just kind of have to use your intuition there.

11:06.680 --> 11:08.440
Go look at some of our example websites.

11:08.440 --> 11:10.520
You could go look at BentonvilleConcrete.com.

11:10.640 --> 11:12.040
It doesn't have to be complicated.

11:12.040 --> 11:13.080
It's very simple.

11:13.200 --> 11:15.480
I promise you guys, even the ugly websites convert.

11:15.920 --> 11:17.760
So that's kind of how I would attack that.

11:18.080 --> 11:19.600
But that's a really good question, Robert.

11:21.520 --> 11:23.440
OK, Luke, you might have had another question.

11:23.440 --> 11:24.360
He's back in the waiting room.

11:25.280 --> 11:26.280
Oh, shoot, hold on.

11:26.880 --> 11:28.840
I think I might have just jumped him in there again.

11:29.840 --> 11:31.600
Hey, did you?

11:31.600 --> 11:32.400
Oh, he's out.

11:32.400 --> 11:33.600
OK, I thought he had another question.

11:33.600 --> 11:34.520
I was like, OK, boy.

11:34.800 --> 11:37.280
Anyway, all right, let's keep going along.

11:37.280 --> 11:39.320
Guys, any questions you have, drop them in the chat.

11:39.320 --> 11:41.720
If you would like, you can you can grab the link.

11:41.720 --> 11:49.320
I'm going to actually pin that comment so you can join with that link above.

11:49.320 --> 11:51.400
You guys are just hopping on and you want to click on the Zoom.

11:51.400 --> 11:52.360
Guys, I'm not that scary.

11:52.360 --> 11:54.200
I promise you, I'm a complete goof.

11:54.960 --> 11:58.760
If you guys, I know when I've I used to get on these live calls and I

11:58.760 --> 12:01.440
was like, oh, my gosh, I can't imagine getting on live with the person.

12:01.640 --> 12:02.760
It's not that big of a deal.

12:02.760 --> 12:03.960
Just hop on live.

12:03.960 --> 12:06.280
And, you know, let's ask your question.

12:06.280 --> 12:07.400
It's going to be quicker.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
All right.

12:12.360 --> 12:15.120
Linnell says Google Keyword Planner says,

12:16.080 --> 12:19.320
before I say this, I want to let you guys know something that's kind of exciting

12:19.680 --> 12:21.800
because this is an ads question.

12:21.800 --> 12:26.400
We actually this is this is why I love that I'm in the trenches, that I'm in the game,

12:26.640 --> 12:31.080
that I think that you cannot trust anyone that's not, is because things change

12:31.080 --> 12:33.880
so freaking much with this business, with any business.

12:33.880 --> 12:36.920
I don't know how you could be in the business five years ago, 10 years ago,

12:37.160 --> 12:39.680
eight years ago, like when I started or maybe four years ago

12:39.680 --> 12:43.760
when I made my first million and pretend like I know everything.

12:43.760 --> 12:47.440
Right. If I wasn't in the game, then I wouldn't have any idea

12:47.440 --> 12:48.560
what you guys are talking about.

12:48.560 --> 12:51.960
So what I want to let you guys know is we are in the process of once again,

12:52.240 --> 12:55.280
testing out some new ad strategies, testing out some new

12:55.440 --> 12:59.640
campaign strategies, spending my own money, testing it on my websites.

12:59.640 --> 13:00.760
We've been doing this now.

13:00.760 --> 13:04.560
It's been about five weeks, I believe.

13:04.760 --> 13:07.760
And we're going to run it for another three weeks, making it eight weeks total.

13:08.000 --> 13:13.040
And then we are going to be redoing the training for the ad section.

13:13.520 --> 13:15.920
And I hate to even tell you guys this, because then everyone's

13:15.920 --> 13:17.800
going to start asking when's it going to be done, when's it going to be done.

13:17.800 --> 13:22.080
It's not going to be done probably till Q1 of 2025,

13:22.080 --> 13:25.320
but we are actually going to be redoing the entire training

13:25.320 --> 13:29.480
start to finish, which would make it the third version of this training

13:29.480 --> 13:32.320
since we launched. OK, I'm actually really excited about it.

13:32.320 --> 13:36.920
I'm a little bit nervous and intimidated by how big of a project that is.

13:37.200 --> 13:40.040
But I also want to always be giving you guys relevant information.

13:40.600 --> 13:43.440
And so any of those little tiny changes, it's kind of like when you have the books

13:43.680 --> 13:46.400
and it's like the classic Think and Grow Rich and it says,

13:46.600 --> 13:48.640
this is the 24th edition, right?

13:48.880 --> 13:51.280
Just those minor things that change with the times.

13:51.680 --> 13:56.280
So a lot of these things, I'm telling you this because once we launch

13:56.800 --> 13:58.880
and what I'm going to do is before we actually launch,

13:58.880 --> 14:01.840
I'm not going to wait to give you guys the the ads updates.

14:01.840 --> 14:05.120
And we're going to introduce the ads updates as soon as possible.

14:05.280 --> 14:09.800
And then for like two or three weeks, we're going to be doing Q&A on these calls.

14:09.800 --> 14:12.240
So any of these questions, we're going to give you guys, you know,

14:12.240 --> 14:15.880
the the the exact answers, maybe even show you guys live on screen.

14:15.880 --> 14:17.400
So I just want to let you know that.

14:17.400 --> 14:20.680
But let me look at this question says Google Keyword Planner says high end CPC.

14:20.840 --> 14:22.960
By the way, Linnell, I don't know if you knew this already.

14:23.720 --> 14:27.360
Have you checked out Ryan Dalton's

14:28.280 --> 14:33.080
rank and rent engine? OK, because that is going to be our go to tool.

14:33.080 --> 14:34.560
I should have mentioned this at the beginning.

14:34.560 --> 14:37.920
But that's going to be our go to tool for search volume.

14:37.920 --> 14:40.720
That's going to be our go to tool for due diligence.

14:40.720 --> 14:42.520
That's going to be our go to tool for everything.

14:42.520 --> 14:47.680
If you guys did not see that already, I think I can message Ryan right now.

14:48.040 --> 14:52.640
Let me look. But there we were doing a

14:53.200 --> 14:55.200
I'm going to drop the link really quick.

14:55.200 --> 14:58.720
We were doing a link. I'm sorry, not a link.

14:59.080 --> 15:04.600
We were doing a beta discount for anyone that wanted to check that out.

15:04.600 --> 15:07.160
So I'm actually going to put this on your comments.

15:07.680 --> 15:11.320
And I'm only mentioning this because that's going to be our go to on

15:11.320 --> 15:14.160
the search volume and the due diligence and everything else.

15:14.160 --> 15:15.240
OK, so check that out.

15:15.240 --> 15:17.080
I can't even remember what the code was.

15:17.200 --> 15:18.080
You have to look at the last one.

15:18.080 --> 15:21.800
There's a code that you guys can use that will

15:23.160 --> 15:24.800
maybe I should message Ryan really quick.

15:24.800 --> 15:26.600
Hold on. Let me message him while we're waiting.

15:28.600 --> 15:30.880
We just ask him, Ryan Dalton,

15:31.520 --> 15:36.040
what's the discount code for beta users?

15:36.800 --> 15:38.680
OK, anyway, guys, check that out.

15:38.680 --> 15:40.520
The thing is sick. I'm pumped about it.

15:40.520 --> 15:43.720
I'm actually going to be spending about 90 minutes today just playing around with it.

15:44.000 --> 15:47.040
But anyway, it says high end CPC is five dollars with the clicks

15:47.040 --> 15:48.440
I'm getting are saying twelve dollars.

15:48.440 --> 15:49.800
It's in tree service.

15:49.800 --> 15:51.840
Is it because the time of year less?

15:51.840 --> 15:54.160
Lonell, can you do a favor for me?

15:54.160 --> 15:55.360
Just make a quick loom.

15:55.360 --> 15:59.080
Send me what you're getting or send it to me and send it to fix it.

15:59.080 --> 16:00.320
Paid ads as well.

16:00.320 --> 16:03.760
And we'll check that out because that's a bit more of a deep question.

16:03.920 --> 16:05.920
And we'll dissect figure out what the heck's going on. OK.

16:07.880 --> 16:10.280
Simon says, oh, what's going on, dude?

16:11.280 --> 16:13.880
Luke says, we're in the meeting again.

16:13.880 --> 16:16.720
Why are you reading this people just join the program?

16:18.520 --> 16:21.080
Luke, Luke, Luke. OK.

16:22.360 --> 16:24.120
OK, Simon has an interesting question.

16:24.120 --> 16:28.720
He says, what do you think about Ecom with the digital asset approach?

16:29.400 --> 16:30.400
Can he do it?

16:31.880 --> 16:37.280
Guys, my answer to this is whether you're asking me about, you know,

16:37.720 --> 16:41.680
whole barns, whether you're asking me about assisted living leads,

16:42.120 --> 16:45.680
if you ask me about whatever, if you use this strategy,

16:45.680 --> 16:50.040
which is getting paid traffic or organic traffic to a landing page

16:50.040 --> 16:53.920
or to a website, you are going to get leads or conversions.

16:53.920 --> 16:56.760
Because if you sell a product, the same principles apply.

16:57.080 --> 17:00.640
However, the thing that makes this model so special

17:00.640 --> 17:03.640
is the fact that we can use a generic website.

17:03.960 --> 17:08.240
And we if if let's say our client starts to get sideways on us,

17:08.240 --> 17:10.440
they start to get a little funny, they start to complain.

17:10.640 --> 17:12.680
We can sell those leads to somebody else.

17:12.680 --> 17:15.520
So if you do Ecom, let's say you go to a company and they're like,

17:15.520 --> 17:18.040
hey, I want you to sell these water filters for us. Right.

17:18.200 --> 17:20.760
And you're doing all this SEO for these water filters.

17:21.800 --> 17:23.120
That's great.

17:23.120 --> 17:25.960
But first of all, first of foremost, you're probably going to be doing SEO

17:25.960 --> 17:28.760
on like a national level, which makes it very difficult.

17:29.520 --> 17:32.240
It's going to be much more difficult to get SEO

17:32.560 --> 17:35.040
to rank using SEO to get organic rankings.

17:35.680 --> 17:39.160
The other thing, guys, is that company is kind of going to have you buy the balls.

17:39.360 --> 17:41.160
Right. Because if you're advertising their products

17:41.160 --> 17:44.120
and you're using their branding or their location or their specific

17:44.440 --> 17:48.320
keywords that they want to target, what happens if they don't want to buy leads anymore?

17:48.720 --> 17:51.840
So you have to remember that one of the best parts about this business model

17:51.840 --> 17:56.320
is the ability to have complete control over our assets

17:56.480 --> 17:59.120
and not have to be at the mercy of anybody.

17:59.200 --> 18:00.960
And this kind of defeats the purpose of it.

18:00.960 --> 18:03.840
So could it work? Yes. Do I recommend it? No.

18:03.960 --> 18:07.840
If it's your own brand and it's your own ecom products,

18:08.760 --> 18:12.280
your own ecom store, your own products, then OK, fine.

18:12.280 --> 18:16.560
Use the SEO principles in the second half of the training to get your website ranked.

18:17.440 --> 18:20.960
But to do it for somebody else, I don't think it's the move. OK.

18:22.840 --> 18:26.440
There goes Luke Hill with the discount code ignition 24. Great.

18:26.680 --> 18:28.920
Thank you. I'm going to try and.

18:29.640 --> 18:30.840
Oh, he already did it. Thank you.

18:31.120 --> 18:35.000
Beautiful. OK. Robert says hot jar.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.120
Wow. Thank you. Yes. Hot jar. Great tool.

18:37.120 --> 18:38.320
OK. I got somebody the waiting room.

18:38.320 --> 18:39.880
I'm going to jump to them really quick.

18:39.880 --> 18:42.280
And then I've got one or two more questions.

18:42.560 --> 18:44.160
By the way, Simon said it's his own website.

18:44.160 --> 18:46.400
Yeah, Simon, use the SEO.

18:46.400 --> 18:50.400
Use the SEO strategies in the training for sure.

18:50.400 --> 18:53.040
If it's your own website, absolutely. OK, 100 percent.

18:53.800 --> 18:56.400
But just realize that that changes the model a bit.

18:56.400 --> 18:58.400
Now you're just doing SEO for your own website, right?

18:59.120 --> 19:00.240
OK, let's see what we got here.

19:00.960 --> 19:06.600
SD. I have no idea.

19:06.600 --> 19:10.080
I'm guessing who's SD, who's got the initial SD. SD.

19:11.480 --> 19:12.880
I can see that you're connected to audio.

19:12.880 --> 19:14.640
I just can't hear you. I can't see you.

19:14.640 --> 19:16.320
Let me know if you can hear me. You can see me.

19:22.800 --> 19:24.800
OK, not hearing anything.

19:25.840 --> 19:26.760
Don't know what's going on.

19:29.440 --> 19:30.880
Let's see what we got. OK.

19:30.880 --> 19:33.720
Well, that person is figuring out what's going on.

19:33.720 --> 19:34.520
I'm going to keep going.

19:38.120 --> 19:41.920
OK, Rob Lamb says, what social media accounts do you create

19:41.920 --> 19:44.040
like Facebook business page, Instagram page, Yelp

19:44.040 --> 19:47.320
to increase your chance of getting a GMB as part of creating a new city niche account?

19:47.320 --> 19:50.640
In other words, what are things you do to help improve Google acceptance?

19:51.600 --> 19:57.240
Guys, I don't spend a bunch of time with GMB anymore, OK,

19:57.560 --> 20:01.720
because to me, can you?

20:01.720 --> 20:03.480
Yes. Is it still possible? Yes.

20:03.480 --> 20:06.640
Did we actually recently got a GMB like in the last two weeks

20:06.640 --> 20:10.200
trying some new strategies, but I have not found anything that's tried and true

20:10.200 --> 20:12.960
that I'm confident saying, hey, here's the new strategy.

20:13.320 --> 20:17.520
What I've kind of opted to do instead is that I am going to focus

20:17.520 --> 20:21.320
on getting better at ads and getting better at organic rankings faster.

20:21.320 --> 20:24.120
OK, because guys, think about it like this.

20:24.120 --> 20:27.120
I've said this before, but you got to realize that when we have

20:28.120 --> 20:30.800
with Google, right, you can get leads from paid ads,

20:31.080 --> 20:33.520
you can get leads from the Google My Business or the local

20:33.520 --> 20:35.440
and you can get leads from organic.

20:35.440 --> 20:39.600
And if you can get two of those three, you're going to be just fine.

20:39.960 --> 20:44.280
Back in 2020, when I was just trying to figure things out

20:44.640 --> 20:47.800
on more than half of my website or at least half of my websites,

20:47.800 --> 20:50.400
I didn't even have a GMB because it didn't click to me.

20:50.400 --> 20:53.080
It didn't occur to me that I could use the business owner's address.

20:53.080 --> 20:54.640
I didn't understand all the stuff.

20:54.640 --> 20:57.560
And so I was going along getting deals scaling up to one hundred

20:57.560 --> 21:00.400
thousand dollars a month, not realizing that I even needed a GMB.

21:00.880 --> 21:02.080
You don't need a GMB.

21:02.080 --> 21:04.200
Now, if you can get one, does it help? Sure.

21:04.920 --> 21:07.800
But even if I have them, I don't like to rely on them for leads

21:07.800 --> 21:09.960
because I feel like they're always problems.

21:09.960 --> 21:11.600
You're falling off. You're doing this.

21:11.600 --> 21:13.880
You're getting suspended. You're checking, checking, checking.

21:14.120 --> 21:15.840
So for me, I just decided, you know what?

21:15.840 --> 21:18.400
I'm going to focus on getting better at the things that I know how to do,

21:18.400 --> 21:19.960
which is ads and organic.

21:19.960 --> 21:22.400
And if we can get the GMB grade, if we can't, then whatever.

21:22.680 --> 21:28.240
However, I will tell you that, yes, the Facebook business page does help.

21:28.400 --> 21:30.000
The Yelp page does help.

21:30.000 --> 21:35.280
But me personally, I'm just focusing on I told you that I'm in simplification mode.

21:35.440 --> 21:37.400
I mean, hey, these are the things I know that work.

21:37.400 --> 21:38.400
So I'm going to focus on them.

21:38.400 --> 21:41.000
And so that's what I've tried to put my effort on.

21:41.760 --> 21:42.680
That doesn't mean you can't.

21:42.680 --> 21:46.040
Doesn't mean that's not a possibility, but that's where I'm putting my focus. OK.

21:48.160 --> 21:48.960
What else we got here?

21:48.960 --> 21:51.840
So hopefully, oh, there we go. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

21:52.320 --> 21:54.240
OK, can you hear me, SD?

21:55.240 --> 21:57.360
Yeah, I can hear you. It's actually should do Daniel.

21:57.960 --> 21:59.800
Oh, what's up, bro? How are you?

21:59.800 --> 22:01.200
Hey, good. This will be good.

22:01.200 --> 22:04.280
Find your question, because I saw your question on the other one.

22:04.600 --> 22:08.960
And I know to be very honest, I saw it and I was like, it's kind of long.

22:08.960 --> 22:09.640
I'll come back to it.

22:09.640 --> 22:11.720
And I'm glad you hopped on it because I forgot to go back to it.

22:11.720 --> 22:13.160
So ask me your question.

22:13.640 --> 22:17.480
All right. So I'm having a tough time figuring out if I'm picking the right guy.

22:17.640 --> 22:19.840
So I just went back to the keywords that you created.

22:19.840 --> 22:22.520
OK, so I'm doing like a ton of analysis.

22:22.520 --> 22:23.560
Maybe I'm doing too much.

22:23.560 --> 22:26.240
I'm analyzing like 26 here because I wrote it.

22:26.240 --> 22:28.560
I'm a programmer, so I wrote an app to do all this for me.

22:28.880 --> 22:30.240
I'm not doing it manually.

22:30.240 --> 22:33.320
So I'm running like 26 keywords per city.

22:34.040 --> 22:36.160
And that's the screenshots I put in.

22:36.160 --> 22:37.480
So am I doing too much?

22:37.480 --> 22:40.720
Like, how do I know if those cities I pasted in are actually good?

22:41.120 --> 22:42.800
Yeah, I think you're doing too much.

22:42.800 --> 22:46.240
I mean, dude, look, I think you're doing too much.

22:46.240 --> 22:50.040
Look, I think people like you are I swear to you.

22:50.040 --> 22:52.200
And I mean this and I mean this as a compliment.

22:52.200 --> 22:53.440
You guys are too smart.

22:53.440 --> 22:58.920
Like the reason why this model works really well for people like me is because I'm like,

22:58.920 --> 23:02.000
all right, I don't even have the patience to do more than like five or seven.

23:02.360 --> 23:06.200
I don't think you need more than five or seven keywords to analyze the city.

23:07.400 --> 23:11.240
OK, all right. So the second part was, I mean, let me say one last thing.

23:11.440 --> 23:14.480
So like tree service, I know that the lists are in here.

23:14.480 --> 23:15.600
I can I can share those two.

23:15.600 --> 23:19.680
And guys, if you guys have lists or you've seen lists I've shared in the past,

23:19.680 --> 23:21.600
that would be awesome for you guys to reshare those.

23:21.600 --> 23:22.520
I can also go and find them.

23:22.520 --> 23:25.840
But tree service, you're looking at at least concrete, because it's just the one

23:25.840 --> 23:28.200
that was used. So concrete is the core keyword.

23:28.200 --> 23:29.960
They got concrete contractors.

23:29.960 --> 23:34.320
I think concrete company, concrete patio, concrete driveway, concrete sidewalk.

23:34.480 --> 23:35.800
There might be one more.

23:35.800 --> 23:38.120
I'm going to use those keywords plus the city.

23:38.360 --> 23:42.320
And that's going to be enough for me to say yes or no on a city.

23:42.320 --> 23:43.640
That's part one. What's part two?

23:44.080 --> 23:46.040
Part two was.

23:47.040 --> 23:51.560
I can't remember right now, so it should I split out the ads like for

23:51.560 --> 23:54.760
let's say I do three ads for concrete, like one is driveway, one is cement,

23:54.760 --> 23:58.240
one is patio. Should I do it all in one or split it into three?

24:01.600 --> 24:03.480
So repeat that question again.

24:03.480 --> 24:05.680
So you're saying split the budget into three.

24:06.400 --> 24:09.160
Yeah, or make three separate ads.

24:09.160 --> 24:15.240
Separate ads like do only one ad that concentrates on cement keywords.

24:15.360 --> 24:20.280
Do another ad that only concentrates on patio keywords.

24:21.680 --> 24:23.720
You know what? That's a really good question.

24:23.720 --> 24:27.880
I don't want to give you guys I would not want to give you advice that.

24:27.880 --> 24:31.600
And I said this at the beginning of the call, I this would be a question

24:31.600 --> 24:34.400
I would I would much rather fix it paid ads answer.

24:35.800 --> 24:39.040
What I would want you to do on this question, and I don't know if you caught this,

24:39.040 --> 24:42.400
but we're actually redoing again the training on the ads and then

24:42.400 --> 24:44.640
and also the entire training.

24:44.640 --> 24:48.520
But for this specific question, I think this is this be valuable for everybody.

24:48.520 --> 24:52.440
If you would post that just that simple question, say, you know, whatever,

24:52.440 --> 24:53.360
post that in the group.

24:53.360 --> 24:55.880
And then if you want to go a step further, make a quick little loom

24:55.880 --> 24:59.560
and send it to me and fix it paid ads, I'll give you an in-depth answer.

24:59.800 --> 25:01.600
But I don't want to just shoot something off the hip.

25:02.920 --> 25:05.280
So would you do that for me?

25:05.280 --> 25:06.480
Yeah, I'll definitely do that.

25:06.480 --> 25:11.080
The only reason I ask is because when you have targeted keywords for that ad,

25:11.080 --> 25:13.680
you get to, you know, you get to that 100 percent.

25:13.680 --> 25:15.760
You know how good the ad is.

25:15.760 --> 25:18.040
You know, you get poor, good and excellent.

25:18.040 --> 25:21.840
If it's all related, like you get closer to the excellent faster.

25:21.840 --> 25:27.320
That's why my my knee jerk reaction is I would tell you to do a separate ad

25:27.320 --> 25:32.720
for each, because, yes, that that is the relevancy that that's really going to help.

25:32.720 --> 25:34.840
And we've noticed that's been a big thing

25:34.840 --> 25:37.000
with the way that we're doing ads now.

25:37.000 --> 25:40.720
However, I also don't want to, you know, if there's somebody out there

25:40.720 --> 25:43.120
that's listening to this and they hear that, oh, three ads,

25:43.360 --> 25:46.200
I would rather you just get them up than not get them up at all.

25:46.200 --> 25:48.520
So if that's causing analysis, paralysis, no.

25:48.720 --> 25:52.240
But yes, 100 percent what you're saying, I think that is going to be the answer.

25:52.240 --> 25:53.280
But I would love for you to post that.

25:53.280 --> 25:54.160
Let's get everyone's feedback.

25:54.160 --> 25:57.120
I'll get fix it paid ads in there and then keep an eye out for this

25:57.600 --> 26:02.520
updated training, which we're about five five out of eight weeks into the testing of.

26:03.640 --> 26:04.440
All right. Sounds good.

26:04.440 --> 26:06.000
I think I got all my questions out of the way.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.440
Awesome, man. Well, I appreciate it.

26:07.440 --> 26:09.760
And let's go get some deals, dude. Thanks a lot.

26:10.240 --> 26:11.760
Hey, talk to you, man.

26:12.840 --> 26:15.920
OK, guys, there's another question or two I want to answer.

26:15.920 --> 26:17.240
You guys have really good questions.

26:17.240 --> 26:19.280
I've got a question is what do you guys use for phone numbers?

26:19.280 --> 26:23.400
I'm going to drop the rank and rent engine

26:24.000 --> 26:29.160
link because that is where we are now buying all of our phone numbers.

26:29.160 --> 26:33.080
However, another option is call rail.

26:33.560 --> 26:36.200
But it's a little more expensive.

26:36.200 --> 26:39.800
That's what we started by using. OK, so there you go.

26:40.440 --> 26:43.280
Hopefully that answers your question.

26:43.760 --> 26:48.000
Luke said, if you throw up a GMB as well for Ecom, it can be a moneymaker.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.400
I've done it before, but that's for more.

26:49.400 --> 26:54.120
Yeah. And that's a good point, Luke, is if this is for your own Ecom,

26:54.480 --> 26:57.520
you're going to be able to get if it's a legit brand, a legit company,

26:57.520 --> 26:59.280
you should be able to get your GMB much easier.

26:59.280 --> 27:02.280
So that's a great little nugget you tossed in there.

27:03.760 --> 27:07.280
OK, Simon says, do you have a list where one can see the key

27:07.280 --> 27:11.280
services by country, if not, that would be really handy for all of us.

27:11.640 --> 27:13.480
Post that in the group. Great question.

27:13.480 --> 27:16.400
And I think what he's saying is like, what are the recommended

27:16.400 --> 27:18.440
services in each country?

27:18.440 --> 27:23.520
And I think that that would be the the the people that are most

27:23.520 --> 27:26.040
equipped to answer those questions would be the people in those countries.

27:26.040 --> 27:28.640
OK, so I'm not doing any deals in Australia.

27:28.640 --> 27:31.360
I'm not doing any deals in the UK personally,

27:31.360 --> 27:34.000
because I'm making my money here.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.720
It makes no sense for me to do that other than probably just a test,

27:36.720 --> 27:38.480
which I probably should.

27:38.480 --> 27:40.160
But drop that question, guys.

27:40.160 --> 27:42.560
We have a we have a community of 700 people trying to do this.

27:42.560 --> 27:45.360
You guys don't have to be on an island by yourselves.

27:45.720 --> 27:46.800
Amazing questions.

27:46.800 --> 27:49.280
Drop that question if you would in the group.

27:49.280 --> 27:51.800
And let's see if anybody has recommendations.

27:51.920 --> 27:54.160
However, I do know just off top my head,

27:54.400 --> 27:59.280
tree service seems to be something that is valuable in every single country.

27:59.640 --> 28:01.200
I've seen that in every single question.

28:01.200 --> 28:02.880
I'm going to I'm going to stand by that one.

28:02.880 --> 28:05.760
That one seems to be like a pretty good one in every single country

28:05.760 --> 28:06.880
from what I could tell. OK.

28:10.000 --> 28:13.280
Steven says you can also decline the recommendations and it will push you up

28:13.280 --> 28:16.560
to 100 percent. Amazing. Great feedback. OK.

28:17.800 --> 28:20.520
Gina says, are you going to do more training on the RankinRat engine platform?

28:20.520 --> 28:22.080
Yes, we are.

28:22.080 --> 28:24.880
We didn't. We wanted to just introduce it really quick

28:24.880 --> 28:26.600
and then let everybody play with it.

28:26.600 --> 28:28.920
And we guys, by the way, if you guys are interested in

28:28.920 --> 28:31.600
if you guys are using that product,

28:31.600 --> 28:34.920
please give feedback to Ryan so we can improve it.

28:36.360 --> 28:39.440
We've noticed a few tiny little bugs as we've been testing with our team.

28:39.440 --> 28:41.080
But that's to be expected. It's beta test.

28:41.080 --> 28:43.360
It's pretty damn good for being a beta test.

28:43.680 --> 28:46.000
But please give feedback to Ryan.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.720
Send him an email. Send him a direct message. Do both.

28:49.560 --> 28:51.720
And yeah, let's just play around with that.

28:51.760 --> 28:55.680
Let's make that thing the I mean, if you guys give us feedback, we can

28:55.680 --> 28:58.120
we can go and I can tell Ryan, hey, let's change this.

28:58.120 --> 29:00.000
Let's change this. I'm super excited about that.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.040
But yes, we're going to be doing that the first week of November

29:02.320 --> 29:04.400
when we do our official launch.

29:06.280 --> 29:07.720
We'll be doing way more training.

29:07.720 --> 29:10.880
But that was kind of just like a hey, let's let let's let people

29:10.880 --> 29:12.920
in the community test this out first.

29:12.920 --> 29:14.800
But there will be a significant amount more.

29:14.800 --> 29:16.840
Plus, there is a Facebook group.

29:17.080 --> 29:19.040
I don't know if you're part of that yet, Gina.

29:19.040 --> 29:22.240
Maybe I'll put this in the answer, but I'm going to say join

29:22.800 --> 29:25.120
the Facebook group.

29:25.120 --> 29:28.880
The rank and rent engine Facebook group.

29:30.640 --> 29:34.720
Yes. OK, so a lot, a lot more to come as far as that training.

29:34.720 --> 29:36.680
That's going to be integrated in everything that we do.

29:39.840 --> 29:42.880
Case. OK, Robert says we got one or two more questions here.

29:42.880 --> 29:46.000
Robert says, Nick, do you try to sign first to be all

29:46.240 --> 29:48.160
that is on top of the sponsored ad section?

29:48.160 --> 29:49.280
Do you check there?

29:49.280 --> 29:53.440
I don't I don't really care if they're at the top or not.

29:53.440 --> 29:56.000
As long as they're running ads, they're going on my list.

29:57.520 --> 30:00.280
But yeah, I mean, checking their reviews is not a bad thing.

30:00.280 --> 30:02.280
If I'm looking at the reviews, they're like, oh, this guy is rude.

30:02.280 --> 30:04.080
This guy had no customer service.

30:04.080 --> 30:05.600
That's going to be my partner.

30:05.600 --> 30:07.200
And that means they're probably not going to close deals.

30:07.200 --> 30:09.040
That's going to be an issue. I want to check into all those things.

30:09.040 --> 30:10.520
So Robert, check into those things.

30:10.520 --> 30:12.760
But yeah, anyone at the top is going on my list.

30:12.760 --> 30:15.320
That's part of our training or part of our module and

30:16.480 --> 30:18.280
building your list.

30:18.280 --> 30:22.600
So, yes. OK, Simon says he volunteers for Middle East and Armenia.

30:22.640 --> 30:26.440
Amazing. Go ahead and make that post and then give us your recommended niches.

30:26.480 --> 30:28.480
You recommend industries for Armenia.

30:28.480 --> 30:30.680
OK, Gina says I'm loving it and have some feedback for sure.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.840
Yes, that's great. Maybe we'll even do something midweek.

30:34.440 --> 30:38.080
Gina, I will even have a pen here. Yeah, I do.

30:39.080 --> 30:41.680
I'm going to make a note here.

30:43.200 --> 30:47.160
Maybe we'll go live, me and Ryan, and we'll just do some more training

30:47.160 --> 30:50.640
and answer questions and get feedback.

30:50.640 --> 30:52.480
That's a great idea, actually. I just wrote it down.

30:52.480 --> 30:55.040
OK, no problem on the questions.

30:58.480 --> 31:01.640
OK, what else? I have time for one more. Let's see.

31:08.200 --> 31:12.760
OK, Rankinret engine says I couldn't use some of my unique niches.

31:12.760 --> 31:15.960
OK, I don't know exactly what you're saying, but that is great feedback.

31:15.960 --> 31:18.600
Would you send that feedback to Ryan?

31:19.200 --> 31:22.600
Just send him a direct message and tell him which niches you're talking about.

31:22.600 --> 31:25.880
Maybe that's just a glitch and let's get that feedback.

31:25.880 --> 31:27.960
That's really good feedback.

31:27.960 --> 31:31.960
Hey, Simon says, how can we measure market saturation for digital assets?

31:34.040 --> 31:37.200
That's I might need you to give a little bit more information on that.

31:37.200 --> 31:39.800
Maybe you can and I can answer it on a on a comment.

31:39.800 --> 31:44.480
But guys, I'm telling you, those of you guys that are worried about saturation,

31:44.480 --> 31:47.200
we are there. Go watch my videos.

31:47.200 --> 31:50.120
Type in saturation. Is Rankinret saturated on YouTube?

31:50.120 --> 31:52.720
And go listen to my logical answers, OK?

31:52.720 --> 31:54.720
This is not saturated.

31:54.720 --> 31:57.920
And just because you guys are seeing other Rankinret people,

31:57.920 --> 32:00.520
other marketers does not mean it's saturated.

32:00.520 --> 32:03.280
Just because there's someone else the website doesn't mean you can't have one.

32:03.280 --> 32:06.880
Just because there's somebody else that, you know, sorry,

32:06.880 --> 32:10.640
just because there is somebody that has a website in your niche and city

32:10.640 --> 32:12.160
does not mean they even have a client.

32:12.160 --> 32:14.560
It doesn't even mean that they're even in the business anymore.

32:14.560 --> 32:17.760
It doesn't mean that they know how to sell and create a deal.

32:17.760 --> 32:20.720
You guys have to remember that those websites that you guys see

32:20.720 --> 32:23.680
and get so scared of, they are just like another local business.

32:23.680 --> 32:26.320
OK, don't worry about that. Keep going. OK.

32:28.360 --> 32:30.440
OK, guys, got a ton of so many good questions.

32:30.440 --> 32:33.120
I mean, here's what I'm going to do. I'm either going to roll it.

32:33.120 --> 32:36.600
I'm going to try to either answer these on comments, me or Aaron

32:37.000 --> 32:39.520
or fix it, fix it, Felix.

32:39.520 --> 32:42.080
Or I'm going to create YouTube videos out of these questions

32:42.080 --> 32:44.160
and I'll send you guys a link to these guys.

32:44.240 --> 32:46.520
I really love you guys hopping on.

32:46.520 --> 32:48.280
I hope next time we have even more people.

32:48.280 --> 32:51.160
It's fun to connect with you guys, to to hear your voices,

32:51.160 --> 32:54.480
see your faces, to remember that like we're all in this together.

32:54.480 --> 32:55.360
We're all trying to make money.

32:55.360 --> 32:57.360
We're all trying to create better lives for ourselves.

32:57.360 --> 32:58.800
So, guys, let's go make some money.

32:58.800 --> 33:02.200
Don't forget that you're not making money if you're not asking for money.

33:02.200 --> 33:05.960

33:06.520 --> 33:10.120

33:10.120 --> 33:11.720
it's about how many offers we make.

33:11.720 --> 33:13.960
That's how you make money.

33:13.960 --> 33:15.280
Stop being distracted.

33:15.280 --> 33:18.080
Go ask people for money and let's scale this thing up, guys.

33:18.080 --> 33:20.560
I'll see you guys later in the week, hopefully with Ryan.

33:20.560 --> 33:22.480
If not, I'll see you guys next Tuesday.
