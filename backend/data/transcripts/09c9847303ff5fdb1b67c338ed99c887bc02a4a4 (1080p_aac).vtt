Gabe says, when leads start coming in on a new ad,

00:03.080 --> 00:05.080
do you get multiple business owners on the hook

00:05.080 --> 00:07.320
from the get or focus on the first?

00:07.320 --> 00:10.000
We've had different people do different things in here.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.840
Let me pour a little bit more mojito.

00:11.840 --> 00:13.800
Oh man, oh man.

00:17.160 --> 00:19.800
If only you guys knew what that tasted like.

00:19.800 --> 00:21.280
Oh man.

00:23.840 --> 00:25.240
Good thing that's not spiked.

00:26.680 --> 00:28.080
So the answer is it's up to you.

00:28.120 --> 00:31.960
I personally, I like to just do one.

00:31.960 --> 00:33.760
I personally do one.

00:33.760 --> 00:35.400
However, we've tried both.

00:35.400 --> 00:36.960
I know there's people in here.

00:37.920 --> 00:40.400
I think Devin Hutcherson, he does multiple people

00:40.400 --> 00:41.800
just to kind of have those backups.

00:41.800 --> 00:45.480
I typically do one and I'll send them like one or two

00:45.480 --> 00:49.520
or three and then I go from the time I talk to a business

00:49.520 --> 00:51.280
owner to the time I close, it's not long.

00:51.280 --> 00:52.920
And I'm always thinking, how can I do this quicker?

00:52.920 --> 00:54.760
So if they're like, hey, let's talk on Monday.

00:54.760 --> 00:56.560
I'm like, how do we talk on Friday?

00:56.560 --> 00:57.880
If they're like, hey, let's talk next Tuesday.

00:58.720 --> 00:59.680
I'm like, how do we talk on Saturday?

00:59.680 --> 01:02.360
I like to shorten my period up and I like to see,

01:02.360 --> 01:03.840
hey, can I close this guy in 24 hours?

01:03.840 --> 01:06.640
So I like to focus on one person and just really,

01:06.640 --> 01:08.640
really like just move fast and go,

01:08.640 --> 01:10.480
but I know other people have had success too.

01:10.480 --> 01:12.120
So it's really up to you, man.
