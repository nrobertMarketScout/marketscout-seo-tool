00:00.000 --> 00:03.280
In order to get to 90% plus close rate,

00:03.280 --> 00:05.480
how much pre-qualification do you do before jumping

00:05.480 --> 00:06.880
on a Zoom with a business owner?

00:06.880 --> 00:08.440
Other than average profits.

00:08.440 --> 00:11.560
Dude, Irving, you and Eugene, by the way,

00:11.560 --> 00:12.400
for anyone that doesn't know,

00:12.400 --> 00:15.280
Eugene and Irving are their partners.

00:16.360 --> 00:17.640
You're gonna get to a point,

00:17.640 --> 00:19.440
and you guys have been doing this for a while now,

00:19.440 --> 00:23.560
but just keep making offers, keep doing Zoom calls.

00:23.560 --> 00:25.120
You're gonna get to a point, Irving,

00:25.120 --> 00:29.280
where you're gonna know with like 98% certainty

00:29.360 --> 00:30.840
whether you're getting the deal or not.

00:30.840 --> 00:33.200
And it's like a soft skill.

00:33.200 --> 00:34.680
It's gonna be impossible for me to say,

00:34.680 --> 00:37.560
yeah, when they say this, this, this, and this guarantee,

00:37.560 --> 00:39.100
you're gonna do enough of these.

00:39.100 --> 00:41.400
And I've done enough where I know by the way

00:41.400 --> 00:42.920
they're talking, the way they're texting,

00:42.920 --> 00:44.960
the way they're interacting, the tone of their voice,

00:44.960 --> 00:46.640
how many leads I've sent them, timing.

00:46.640 --> 00:48.680
I know if I'm getting the deal.

00:48.680 --> 00:50.600
And guys, it's to the point now,

00:52.320 --> 00:54.880
excuse me, it got to the point in late 2021

00:54.880 --> 00:56.400
when we were going super hard.

00:56.720 --> 01:00.800
I, like guys, I didn't lose deals.

01:00.800 --> 01:04.120
Like I just didn't like ever lose deals.

01:04.120 --> 01:09.120
Like you, but I also knew what I was looking for

01:09.160 --> 01:12.680
and I only got on Zoom calls with people who were my fit.

01:12.680 --> 01:15.960
So my advice to you would be,

01:15.960 --> 01:17.800
you guys are doing this already,

01:17.800 --> 01:21.400
take really good notes of like, okay, I closed this guy.

01:21.400 --> 01:23.640
What are some of the things that were consistent there?

01:23.640 --> 01:26.040
Okay, he said this, he said this,

01:26.640 --> 01:27.880
we sent him three leads, he closed one.

01:27.880 --> 01:28.840
And it was over this period.

01:28.840 --> 01:30.640
And I know Eugene's really good at keeping track

01:30.640 --> 01:31.480
of that kind of stuff.

01:31.480 --> 01:33.360
But it's just one of those things that's a soft skill.

01:33.360 --> 01:34.200
You're gonna learn it.

01:34.200 --> 01:36.280
It's really hard to teach it without the experience.

01:36.280 --> 01:37.840
But you guys are doing enough deals.

01:37.840 --> 01:39.020
You're getting up to bad enough

01:39.020 --> 01:40.520
where you're gonna be learning that.
