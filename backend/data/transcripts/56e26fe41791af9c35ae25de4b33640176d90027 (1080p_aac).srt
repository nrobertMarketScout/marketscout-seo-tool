1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,080
You let the business owner know.

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,400
Say, Mr. Business Owner, I have a, you know,

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,560
I got this, when you call it,

4
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:06,760
when I'm gonna get it in a second,

5
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,120
you're gonna let them know you have a lead.

6
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:09,160
You're gonna let the business owner,

7
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,440
hey, for these first couple of leads,

8
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,920
I'm actually gonna do a live transfer.

9
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,200
I am going to have the lead on the phone.

10
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,640
So Mr. Business Owner, Mr. Business Owner,

11
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,440
you got my number, save it in your phone

12
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:25,240
and make sure to save it all caps, answer phone.

13
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,560
This is a hot lead, okay?

14
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,600
I need you to answer this call because it's gonna be money.

15
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,520
We're talking about money, it's a digital goal.

16
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,680
So make sure to answer this call

17
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,360
and I'm gonna be calling you back shortly.

18
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,920
Okay, you hang up the phone.

19
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:37,760
Now what do you do?

20
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,800
You call the lead back.

21
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,360
Hey, Janet, just wanted to let you know

22
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,760
I've got the business owner.

23
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:43,600
He's gonna be available.

24
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,400
So I'm actually just gonna do a three-way call

25
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,560
and get you guys patched in together.

26
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,600
He's driving.

27
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,440
Hang on one second.

28
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:52,120
It's gonna go quiet, boom, patch him in, boom, okay?

29
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,720
That's how you're gonna do it for the first

30
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,400
and you're gonna rinse and repeat, rinse and repeat.

31
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,600
Now, some of you guys go,

32
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,760
oh, do you live transfer every single lead for,

33
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,160
no, okay, I used to.

34
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,800
I used to, I thought it was this great upsell

35
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,120
and I used to say, hey, I'm charging you a premium.

36
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,840
Guys, the logistical nightmare

37
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,840
of live transferring every lead is very, very tough, okay?

38
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,080
You'll never, once you get past a couple handful of clients,

39
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,200
you're never gonna be able to do it all

40
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,960
and you're gonna have to have multiple staff on board

41
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,000
and then it's this whole thing.

42
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So I only do this live transfer

43
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
during the initial couple of calls, okay?
