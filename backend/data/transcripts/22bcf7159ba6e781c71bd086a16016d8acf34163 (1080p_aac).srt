1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,780
All right, so once we've let the business owner know who we are and we've done this

2
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:20,240
miniature transition into what we're doing, giving them a damn good reason, we're going

3
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,340
to now explain why we're calling.

4
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:25,840
We got to let these guys know, or these ladies, guys, whatever, we got to let them know why

5
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,920
we're calling and why it's important they listen to us because we're interrupting their

6
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:29,920
day.

7
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,320
They do not want to be interrupted.

8
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,000
You got to give them a damn good reason, and it better be different than everybody else.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,920
Now I do want to mention this.

10
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,160
I know that in this entire process, as I've talked about, and I've mentioned this before,

11
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:49,080
that we talk about the transition at the end of the hook, but there's also miniature transitions

12
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:54,160
in between each step, and so here's what's cool about this, is after in the first step

13
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,340
when you ask the three questions, you pattern, interrupt, tell them who you are, typically

14
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,700
what's going to happen is the business owner at some point is going to cut you off and

15
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,540
go, wait, wait, who are you?

16
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:07,460
Basically what they're saying is, who the hell are you, why are you calling me?

17
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:11,460
You didn't mention who you are, are you a real estate agent, are you a contractor trying

18
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,620
to send me work, is this your house?

19
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:19,780
They're going to ask something of that version, or some version of that, and that's going

20
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:24,620
to be a perfect opportunity for you to just segue, transition directly into what you're

21
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:25,620
doing.

22
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:26,620
Here's the steps you're going to follow.

23
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,900
Once they ask that, let's pretend that they do that.

24
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:32,260
What we're going to do now, and when we're explaining this, we're going to ask a couple

25
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:33,260
things.

26
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,180
We're going to say a couple things.

27
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:38,260
First of all, we're going to tell them our name, and we're going to tell them that we

28
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:41,460
have a website in this city.

29
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:47,820
Then we're going to tell them that we do not have a company, but that we have jobs.

30
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,100
We don't have a tree company, per se.

31
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:54,180
We don't do tree work, we don't do concrete work, but we have jobs coming in every single

32
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,180
week.

33
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:59,340
Then we're going to tell them that we call them specifically because we saw that they

34
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:05,540
were paying for leads, or paying for ads, or paying for whatever, or did this.

35
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:10,700
We know that that means they're hungry to grow, and then we're going to transition into

36
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:11,700
the deal.

37
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,540
What does that look like?

38
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,820
We get done, they're like, hey, so who are you?

39
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:17,820
Oh, sorry.

40
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,660
By the way, Jack, my name is Nick.

41
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:27,060
The reason I'm calling you is because I have a website here in Austin, here in, we want

42
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:33,620
them to know that we're local, I have a website here in Austin that gets three to five concrete

43
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:38,820
jobs every single week, and I don't do concrete.

44
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:46,420
I have a website here in Austin, here in St. George, here in whatever, and I don't do concrete,

45
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,260
but it's getting X amount of jobs.

46
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,820
If you don't have a site already, you're just doing a pre-sell, don't say more than three

47
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:55,700
to five, because three to five is a really safe number that you're going to expect off

48
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,700
of ads.

49
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:01,780
If you have a site that's been producing for years, and this sucker's pulling in 20 a week,

50
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:05,500
go ahead and say it, but let's not oversell this from day one.

51
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,060
Let's not oversell at all, but especially not from the first conversation.

52
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:12,340
Hey, I got a website here in Austin, it's getting three to five concrete jobs every

53
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:17,180
single week, and I don't do concrete.

54
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,180
We said that.

55
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:23,340
The reason I'm specifically calling you, Jack, is I noticed you're paying for Google Ads,

56
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:29,260
so I know that you are hungry to grow, or at least I assumed you would like a job.

57
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:33,220
I assumed you'd be happy to take on this job that I have, I have this lady named Janet,

58
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,220
whatever.

59
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,020
That's it.

60
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:41,540
We're just going to, and this step right here, we have to let them know why we are calling,

61
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,540
what we're doing.

62
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,220
Got to give them that reason.

63
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:48,460
Those are the main things that I like to hit is, they're going to cut you off in the middle

64
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:52,660
of step one, transitioning to step two, they're going to ask who the hell you are, and you're

65
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:56,060
literally just going to tell them, hey, sorry, Jack, my name's Nick, I have a website here

66
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,740
in Bentonville, Arkansas.

67
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,860
Don't say Arkansas, because that makes it sound like you're out of state.

68
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,940
I have a website here in Bentonville, it's getting three to five concrete jobs every

69
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,180
single week.

70
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:10,140
I specifically found you on purpose, because I saw you're paying for Google Ads, so I

71
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:14,300
already know you're hungry to grow, and I'm looking for someone to take on these jobs,

72
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,940
or I'm looking to work with somebody on an ongoing basis.

73
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,740
I don't actually have a concrete company.

74
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:22,380
You notice how when I explained that the first time, and now I explained it the second time,

75
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:25,900
I said that differently, but it was the exact same thing.

76
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:29,500
It's not about saying the exact phrase, and by the way, I'm going to give you guys, there's

77
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,700
going to be a PDF, there's going to be an exact script that you can follow, but I want

78
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:39,260
you to notice, you can say things multiple ways, and still convey the same message.

79
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:43,900
Sometimes I'll first tell them I don't have a company, but I have jobs, sometimes I have

80
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,940
jobs coming in, and I'll forget to mention I have a company.

81
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:52,940
The main point is, you want to be honest and direct and say, hey, I don't have a company,

82
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:57,660
I got jobs coming in, I have a job right now that's hot as hell, it's ready to go.

83
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:58,660
Notice how I didn't even said that.

84
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:02,140
This is my third time kind of explaining it, and this is the first time I'm saying I have

85
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:05,540
a specific job right now.

86
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,700
I don't want you guys to stress so much.

87
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:11,700
I'm going to give you the exact script, I just want to break down the important points

88
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,700
to hit.

89
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,940
We talked about the first part, which is who you are.

90
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,500
The second part is why you're calling them.

91
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,420
You have to have a good reason, and it has to make sense.

92
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:25,340
What makes sense to me, if I put myself in their shoes, is, hey, this kid has a website,

93
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:30,020
he's getting jobs, he doesn't actually have a concrete company, and he's calling me because

94
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:32,500
I'm already spending money on ads so he knows that I'm hungry.

95
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,740
That makes sense to me.

96
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:39,780
By the way, Jack, I have this lady named Janet, she's at Silver Beach Circle, she needs a

97
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,020
tree removed.

98
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,860
This is where we're going to transition into the deal.

99
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:49,460
And so, I have this lead, her name's Janet, that's our transition.

100
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:52,860
We're going to then transition into the third step.

101
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:56,940
So guys, don't overthink it, I just want you to get through these videos.

102
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:01,300
In the last video of this module, I'm going to give you an example from A to Z, and it's

103
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:05,820
going to be as closely as I can following the script.

104
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:09,980
But I'm telling you guys, I've done this so many times, I've said it so many times, it's

105
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:14,980
just ingrained in my mind, and sometimes I mix up the order.

106
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,220
Sometimes it just flows differently.

107
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:19,620
I know the steps, I know the things, you have to tell them who you are, you have to tell

108
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,940
them what you're doing, what the deal is, you have to transition.

109
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:26,580
But sometimes they're out of order, and it's okay because it sounds more natural.

110
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:33,340
So step two of the perfect prospecting script is a damn good reason why you're calling,

111
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:38,820
and tell them exactly, not mincing words, why it is that you're interrupting their day.
