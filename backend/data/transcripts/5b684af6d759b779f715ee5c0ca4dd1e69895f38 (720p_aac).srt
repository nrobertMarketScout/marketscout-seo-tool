1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
Guys, welcome to the call.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:14,160
Welcome to the freaking live digital landlords call that we do every single week at 7 a.m.,

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:20,200
every day, every week of the year, unless I'm on a plane or unless I'm in the bush with

4
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,960
no internet, okay?

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:29,640
One thing that I do need to do, before I forget, hold on.

6
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,040
I do need to get a piece of paper because I always, when I'm doing these calls, I get

7
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,260
all these great ideas and then I need to write them down, like I just barely had one.

8
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:44,880
So give me just a second, I'm going to write this, it's the 26th I think, no, it's the

9
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,880
25th?

10
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:51,480
Dude, it was the 26th or 25th yesterday.

11
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,960
Um, all right, okay, guys, can you hear me?

12
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,040
Can somebody give me a comment and let me know if they can hear me really, really quick?

13
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:07,600
Stephanie, Richard, maybe my, dude, that's, I bet you it's my, uh, I bet you it's my stupid

14
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,200
Facebook.

15
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,200
Let's see here.

16
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:18,600
Yeah, it is, that's really crazy, I can't even see the comments as they come in.

17
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,640
So I'm going to have Porter read the comments because it lags.

18
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,000
Kevin Williams, what's up?

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,160
Kurt Dahlstrom, what's up?

20
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:31,400
Gina Benson, what's going on, Adair, um, I don't know why there's no notification that

21
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,400
I'm going live.

22
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,240
Sorry about that, Kevin Moss, I'm glad that you found me.

23
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,640
Maybe what we should do, Porter, if you're listening right now, tag everyone, uh, actually

24
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,640
let me just let Porter know really quick.

25
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,640
Yo.

26
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,640
Hey, what's up?

27
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,640
Can you hear me?

28
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,640
Yeah, I can.

29
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,640
What's up, dude?

30
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,640
How are you doing?

31
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,640
I'm good, man.

32
00:01:50,640 --> 00:02:01,840
Hey, um, I just want to see, first of all, if they can see both of us because this has

33
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,560
been a really weird thing with Zoom.

34
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,560
Oh, great.

35
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,320
I want to see me.

36
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,320
That's a phenomenal.

37
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:12,360
Okay, bro, here's what you're going to do.

38
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:20,960
Hop off and, uh, and then I think if you get on, I should be able to just bring you on

39
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,960
live.

40
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,960
Yeah.

41
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,360
Hop off and just, just watch it as a guest or make a comment.

42
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,840
Let me see if I can bring you on that way.

43
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:32,520
Cause for some reason, something's up with my stripe or my stripe, my, uh, my zoom, by

44
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,120
the way, welcome Erwin McKenzie.

45
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,120
Yeah.

46
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,120
Hop off and just join as a guest, dude.

47
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,120
And I'll try to bring you on.

48
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,120
Cool.

49
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,120
Okay.

50
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,120
I'll hop off.

51
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,120
Cool.

52
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,120
My comments are finally showed up.

53
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,120
Erwin McKenzie.

54
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,120
What's going on, dude?

55
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,120
I think this is your first live call.

56
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,120
Welcome to the call.

57
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,120
Clellan Bradshaw.

58
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,120
What's up?

59
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,120
Uh, from Beaver, Utah.

60
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,120
Good to have you on, dude.

61
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,120
Mahmood.

62
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,120
What's up?

63
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,120
Stephanie can hear me.

64
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,120
Fine.

65
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,920
Uh, some people got the notification.

66
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,920
Some people didn't.

67
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,920
I have no idea what's going on.

68
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,920
Laura Shepherd morning.

69
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,920
All right.

70
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,480
We're going to try to get Porter.

71
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,080
Hopefully Porter can, uh, join.

72
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,080
Okay.

73
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:11,040
Let's see if I can get Porter to come on here.

74
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,080
Why doesn't it give me the option to bring Porter on?

75
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,400
It gives me the option to bring on other people.

76
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,920
Uh, that's weird Porter.

77
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,920
I don't know.

78
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,520
Just keep, keep commenting or say something because I, it says I can bring on Gina.

79
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,440
It says I can bring on Kevin.

80
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,440
You know what, Porter?

81
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,400
Try it.

82
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,400
Try to turn it on from your phone and see if that happens.

83
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,400
Okay.

84
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,040
Mahmood says I lost the fight with Raul.

85
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,040
That's my daughter.

86
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,040
She got my nose.

87
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,040
Yeah.

88
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,040
I think.

89
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,040
Yeah, basically.

90
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,840
Um, I got a little preventative, uh, dermatology done guys.

91
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,920
I got some spots burnt or frozen off my nose.

92
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,640
So I'm in just recovery phase here, but it had to happen at some point.

93
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,880
Um, let me see if I can just get Porter on really quick guys.

94
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,880
Then we'll just get going.

95
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,880
I got a few things I want to say.

96
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,320
But I don't know why you have Porter.

97
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,720
Try to jump on from your phone.

98
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:11,480
Try to watch from your phone and, uh, yeah, let's see.

99
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:16,240
Really need to get Porter on this thing.

100
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,240
Let's see.

101
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,240
Let's see.

102
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,240
It keeps saying Kevin Masa.

103
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,240
Watching.

104
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,680
That's good.

105
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,320
That is so strange.

106
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:30,960
Um, let me see if I say at Porter.

107
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,680
Try to watch from your phone.

108
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,800
Yeah, I'm not really sure what's going on with my zoom these days guys.

109
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,800
It's going crazy.

110
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,760
I'm going to have to, I'm going to have to, okay, there that is, that's going to work.

111
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:46,480
It's going to say, I think it's giving me the option.

112
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:51,000
It says I can, it says I have the little green button there, bud.

113
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
All right.

114
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,680
Let me see if I can pull it up from my computer.

115
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,780
Let Porter on and then we'll shake and bake here.

116
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:04,500
Let's see if I can find myself live.

117
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:17,140
It shows the, aha, there we go, wait, Porter, did that send you notification, bud?

118
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,140
I think we're good.

119
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:29,300
I think we're going to be able to do it.

120
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,140
Your audience is set to custom.

121
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:34,140
What is going on people?

122
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,140
Audience set to custom.

123
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,140
Why are there so many settings?

124
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,540
Why can't we just go live?

125
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:45,340
Ah, boy, audience.

126
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:48,340
That's crazy.

127
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:51,700
Porter, it says I'm, I'm, I'm letting you on.

128
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:54,860
Nick Ford, what's up, dude?

129
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,860
All right.

130
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:00,820
If I hold on to your name, dude, it's given me this option.

131
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:05,140
If anyone could tell me what to do here, it says your audience is set to custom.

132
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,820
So many people you select can watch this live broadcast.

133
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,820
That's great.

134
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,820
Hmm.

135
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,820
Hmm.

136
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,580
Okay.

137
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,580
One more thing.

138
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,580
Just give me one second, guys.

139
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:21,380
If this doesn't work, we're going to, we're going to improvise here, how to change my

140
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:26,380
audience from custom.

141
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,380
Just see really quick.

142
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,380
There's a way on the menu, top right at Facebook.

143
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,380
Okay.

144
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:35,380
This should be just a second here.

145
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,380
All right.

146
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:43,380
It says on my post, hit the buttons, oops, hit the buttons, whoops, whoops, whoops, whoops.

147
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:50,380
Tap your name, scroll down to the post, tap my name, scroll down to the post.

148
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:53,380
Oh, boy.

149
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,380
Okay.

150
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,380
I think this will work.

151
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,380
Let's hope.

152
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:02,380
If not, then we're just going to go anyway.

153
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:09,380
Groups, DL, and let's try this.

154
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:15,380
Select change audience.

155
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:20,380
Ah, well, no.

156
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,380
Well, all right, guys.

157
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,380
There we go.

158
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,380
That's great.

159
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:30,380
I'm going to put Ashley in charge of this today as the only task that she has to do.

160
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:35,380
Um, wild.

161
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,380
I don't know.

162
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,380
Okay.

163
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,380
Here's what we're going to do.

164
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:41,380
We're going to improvise.

165
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:44,380
Yeah, Porter.

166
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,380
Porter, just hop back on the link.

167
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,380
I'll try to do one or two things.

168
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:51,380
You might just have to talk, dude.

169
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,380
Let's just do this thing.

170
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,380
Try to jump back on that link here.

171
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:56,380
Let me send you one more link, and then we'll just get going, guys.

172
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,380
Apologize for that.

173
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,380
While Porter's jumping on, I'm actually going to do this.

174
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,380
Porter, I'm going to send you a link.

175
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,380
I'm going to share a couple of things.

176
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,380
Matthew McClellan, what's up?

177
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,380
Wouldn't Porter be a presenter?

178
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,380
Yeah, I don't know.

179
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:11,380
I'm going to try to send him.

180
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:13,380
That's wild.

181
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,380
All right.

182
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:17,380
We're going to send this one more time, but I'm going to, I got a couple of things I want

183
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:19,380
to say without Porter jumping on anyway.

184
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,380
Okay.

185
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,380
Here we go.

186
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,380
One more time.

187
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,380
All right.

188
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,380
While Porter's jumping on, guys, welcome to the call.

189
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:28,380
Um, again, it's Tuesday, February 25th.

190
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:31,380
It's almost two months into the year.

191
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:35,380
Six, almost a sixth of the way done with this year.

192
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:39,380
Exciting and also terrifying, right?

193
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:45,380
Uh, I, it's exciting if you're actually doing the work, if you're, if you're on track to

194
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:48,380
hit goals, if you're seeing yourself progress, it's really exciting.

195
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:52,380
And I've been on the other, last year, I'll be honest, I was on the other side of the,

196
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,380
uh, by the way, Porter, I'm going to let you on just a second.

197
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,380
Let me just finish my thought.

198
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,380
Yes.

199
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:59,380
Last year I was on the other side of the coin where I was like, oh my gosh, time's slipping

200
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:02,380
by and I don't know if I think I've done anything.

201
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,380
Right?

202
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:09,380
Um, and I've said this a few times, guys, admittedly, last year I, uh, I was in a, in

203
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:13,380
a weird mental fog, but, um, I'm, I'm ready this year.

204
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,380
I'm, I'm here.

205
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:15,380
I'm ready.

206
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,380
I'm pumped.

207
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:22,380
Um, one thing that I draw, I want to just remind you guys of, I put this in the, uh,

208
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,380
the group.

209
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,380
I made a post about this.

210
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:30,380
If you guys have not already, I have a, uh, PDF that I share with you guys with a book

211
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,380
called The Slide Edge.

212
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:35,380
Go and start reading that book for just read 10 pages a day.

213
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,380
Do it on your phone.

214
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:40,380
That's probably the equivalent of like four or five pages on a regular book.

215
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:46,380
Just go read 10 pages of this book every single day and start to make tiny implementations

216
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,380
of what this book is teaching you guys.

217
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,380
And it's going to freaking change your business.

218
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,380
Okay.

219
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,380
Um, I don't, I don't have a kickback from this book.

220
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,380
That link is a free PDF.

221
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,380
This isn't some kind of weird affiliate thing.

222
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:02,380
It is literally just completely given me so much momentum.

223
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,380
Go check this book out.

224
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,380
I've made Porter.

225
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,380
Watch this or start reading this as well.

226
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:07,380
If you guys didn't see my post, go and search my name.

227
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:12,380
Type in Nick Wood, go and look for the post where I gave a, uh, this book, The Slide Edge

228
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,380
by Jeff Olson.

229
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,380
Guys, go start reading 10 pages of that.

230
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,380
Of course you don't have to.

231
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,380
It's your business.

232
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:20,380
It's your life, but it's, it's been one of the best things I've done.

233
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:26,380
I started it almost exactly a month ago and everything is completely changed in, in the

234
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,380
better.

235
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,380
And I sincerely mean that.

236
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:31,380
It sounds a little bit like a cheesier over the top, but I'm dead serious.

237
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,380
It's been amazing.

238
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,380
Okay.

239
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:37,380
Um, another thing that I was going to just say really, really quick, and this is before

240
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:44,380
Porter hops on, um, Richard says, can you send that link again?

241
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,380
I'm not really sure what link you're talking about.

242
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:50,380
My friend, uh, I sent the link to Porter, but he's, he's in the waiting room.

243
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,380
So I'm gonna let him on.

244
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,380
I don't know which link you're talking about, sir.

245
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:55,380
Um, you know what I was thinking about yesterday?

246
00:10:55,380 --> 00:11:02,380
I was sitting on the treadmill and I have a couple of buddies that I know personally

247
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:04,380
that are in this group.

248
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,380
Okay.

249
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:10,380
And, uh, you actually, anyone that knows me is going to think I'm talking about them,

250
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:14,380
but there's some, there was two specific, there was actually one specific person I had

251
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,380
in mind.

252
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:19,380
Um, and I was sitting there thinking in my head, like I was about to text them last night

253
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:22,380
and, and say, cause I went to the gym a little bit late.

254
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:25,380
I was about to say, uh, where are you at?

255
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:28,380
Why are, why have I not seen you get a deal recently?

256
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:31,380
Why are you not, um, posting that you got to win?

257
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:34,380
You know, and I, that's how my thoughts started.

258
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:38,380
And then I just started thinking about like Porter, who I'm about to bring on, who's,

259
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:43,380
uh, at 10,700, he actually went up a hundred dollars after replacing these clients.

260
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:46,380
And I wanted to just, then I started to just get pissed off.

261
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:54,380
And I was thinking, like, guys, if you're watching this stream right now and you, like,

262
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:59,380
you're not annoyed that me and Porter are making the kind of money that we're making

263
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,380
from renting simple websites.

264
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:09,380
Like you don't know, like the, the, the, the basicness of our personalities, of our education

265
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:12,380
level, it should, it should piss you off.

266
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:13,380
Okay.

267
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:18,380
We are not by any means, oh, it's, you know, like we have, we have no tech experience.

268
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,380
Okay.

269
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,380
We've never done websites.

270
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,380
We didn't grow up doing that.

271
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:26,380
We grew up literally working on the farm and, and not everyone, I know some of you guys

272
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:29,380
are beating Porter, but he's beating a lot of you guys.

273
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:31,380
Like he's kicking your butt.

274
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,380
He is at 10,700.

275
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,380
He replaced two of his clients on Saturday.

276
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,380
He's got another deal in the works this week.

277
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:40,380
And some of you guys are, I see you every week on the stream and you're still not getting

278
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,380
a deal.

279
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,380
Like, what are you doing?

280
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,380
What are you?

281
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,380
Are you like, are you going to ever get a deal?

282
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,380
Are you ever going to get the next deal?

283
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:51,380
Are you ever going to, or is it just going to be a constant blame everybody else and

284
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:56,380
the time that you don't have and the weather and the fact that you got so much going on?

285
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,380
It's like, so does he dude.

286
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:59,380
He's Porter's got a kid.

287
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,380
Porter's got a full-time thing with my dad.

288
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,380
Like he does every reason to make excuses.

289
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,380
Right.

290
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:09,380
Why don't you guys, why, why some of you guys I see in here, why didn't you get a deal

291
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,380
this week?

292
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,380
Why haven't you gotten a deal yet?

293
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,380
Why haven't you gotten a deal in the last month?

294
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,380
What are you guys doing?

295
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,380
Like you're getting beat by Porter.

296
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:23,380
You like, what are you doing?

297
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,380
Porter's kicking your butt.

298
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,380
Have a little bit of pride.

299
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,380
Get pissed off.

300
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:30,380
Doesn't mean you have to hate on Porter or wish bad on Porter.

301
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:34,380
But guys, I remember when I was just starting, I would see people posting in the group that

302
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,380
were making money.

303
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:39,380
And to be honest, I think they were lying because now looking back on it, those people

304
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:42,380
are, I see sometimes their Facebook friends and stuff.

305
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:45,380
I'm like, dude, they were never making any money, but that's another story.

306
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:48,380
And I would see these posts and I would just piss me off.

307
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:51,380
I'm like, and I wasn't like, oh, they took money out of my pocket.

308
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,380
It was like, Nick, pull your freaking head out, dude.

309
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,380
These guys, I'm looking at them.

310
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:58,380
I'm seeing the post, whether it was real or not.

311
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,380
I'm going to their profile.

312
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,380
I'm like, dude, this guy, I'm better than this guy.

313
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:06,380
And I don't mean that in like a arrogant way, but like, dude, I know that if this guy can

314
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:11,380
get a deal, if this guy's at $10,000 a month, this guy's at $20,000 a month, what are you

315
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,380
doing?

316
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:16,380
Like, what are they doing that you're not doing?

317
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,380
Come on.

318
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,380
Have a little bit of pride, guys.

319
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,380
I want you guys to get excited.

320
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,380
I want you guys to get on these calls.

321
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:26,380
I want you guys to have good energy.

322
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,380
But like, when is enough enough?

323
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,380
When is it like, dude, this is too much.

324
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,380
I've got to get a freaking deal, right?

325
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:36,380
Like, when are you going to draw a line in the sand and say, look, I paid to be in this

326
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,380
program.

327
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,380
I'm here.

328
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,380
I'm getting on the lives.

329
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,380
I've gone through the training.

330
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,380
I've chosen this as the business model.

331
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,380
It's time to get a deal, guys.

332
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,380
You might have to get scrappy.

333
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:52,380
You might have to call every single person in your phone and tell them that you do lead

334
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:56,380
generation and tell them that you can get them more leads to get your first deal.

335
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,380
And you might have to follow up with that with that same list.

336
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:01,380
I think Hermosy talks about this in $100 million leads.

337
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:05,380
You might have to reach out to every single person and follow up with them every single

338
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,380
day for the next month.

339
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:11,380
But if you took every contact, you know, that owns a business and you followed up with them

340
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:15,380
every day for a month, you cannot tell me you couldn't squeeze a deal out of that.

341
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,380
You could not.

342
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:22,380
You cannot tell me you can't get a $300, $500, $750, $1,000 a month deal by just squeezing

343
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,380
your contacts.

344
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,380
You cannot tell me that.

345
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:28,380
Okay, guys, me and Francesca are getting scrappy.

346
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:29,380
We're doing stuff.

347
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,380
We're posting.

348
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:31,380
You guys saw my post yesterday.

349
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,380
We're posting in yard sale groups.

350
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:34,380
We're posting here.

351
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:39,380
She's going to the Chamber of Commerce looking at this, shaking hands, kissing babies, going

352
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,380
around town.

353
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:43,380
We're doing all kinds of stuff, testing all kinds of stuff.

354
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:50,380
If you've been in this program for more than two months and you do not have a deal, that's

355
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,380
on you.

356
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:54,380
Okay, because even if you don't want to run ads, even if you don't have money to run ads,

357
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,380
whatever it is, you should have a deal.

358
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:57,380
That's just fact.

359
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,380
That's just fact.

360
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,380
You have enough contacts.

361
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:02,380
You've been alive 18 plus years.

362
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,380
You've got enough contacts.

363
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:07,380
Even if you're 18, you don't have a bunch of big guys or big women that are your friends.

364
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:10,380
Your parents and their friends have big people.

365
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,380
Guys, take a little bit of pride.

366
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:14,380
Get a little bit pissed off that Porter's kicking your butt.

367
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:20,380
He's at $10,700 a month with a full-time job, with a baby, married, has every excuse not

368
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:24,380
to be making money, and he's running circles around some of you guys.

369
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,380
We've all got stuff going on.

370
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,380
When I started, I had a full-time thing doing door-to-door sales.

371
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,380
I had a kid, one on the way.

372
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,380
I had a team to manage.

373
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:34,380
I had church responsibilities, all that stuff.

374
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:38,380
Guys, I went to the gym every day, and I got deals.

375
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,380
What are you guys doing?

376
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,380
When are you going to have a freaking little bit of pride?

377
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:44,380
Let's draw a line in the sand, and let's go.

378
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,380
That's all I got.

379
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,380
Okay, let's get Porter on here.

380
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,380
You're not even going to be able to see him, but who cares, because some of you guys...

381
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:53,380
Porter, can you hear me?

382
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,380
Porter.

383
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,380
Hey, what's going on?

384
00:16:55,380 --> 00:17:00,380
Hey, I'm just going to pin you, because apparently this is the dumbest thing ever.

385
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:01,380
I don't know.

386
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,380
I'm going to make you the co-host.

387
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,380
We're going to start with that.

388
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:10,380
Then I'm going to pin you, and then we're going to just go.

389
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,380
Guys, you're not going to be able to see Porter.

390
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,380
Sorry about that.

391
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,380
We're just going to roll.

392
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,380
Listen to his voice.

393
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,380
My Facebook also is lagging.

394
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:20,380
Facebook has some of the crappiest tools on the internet.

395
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,380
They don't want to work with anyone.

396
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:26,380
They're like Apple, but at least Apple has good products.

397
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:30,380
If Facebook wasn't so convenient, I'd get off of Facebook in five seconds.

398
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,380
Screw you, Mark.

399
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,380
All right.

400
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:35,380
I'm just annoyed right now.

401
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,380
By the way, slide edge.

402
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,380
Sorry.

403
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,380
That's what Richard was talking about.

404
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:39,380
Thank you, Nick.

405
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,380
He was talking about...

406
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,380
Can you share the link?

407
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,380
There's the slide edge.

408
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,380
You guys can't see Porter.

409
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,380
We're just going to go.

410
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,380
Porter, I'm going to give a little bit of a backdrop.

411
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:49,380
Porter, he was at $10,600 about a week ago.

412
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:52,380
He had a client that wasn't paying.

413
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:58,380
It was one of those deals where they're missing a payment and all this different stuff.

414
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:01,380
By the way, guys, if you do have clients like this, don't just accept it.

415
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,380
Don't just let them walk all over you.

416
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:07,380
Realize that you're the one that holds the keys, the leverage.

417
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:13,380
Anyway, he had this client that wasn't paying, and he knew he had to replace this client.

418
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,380
It's a scary thing.

419
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,380
No one wants to replace a client.

420
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:19,380
Sometimes we're sitting there going, man, I'll keep dealing with it.

421
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,380
No.

422
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:24,380
Then he had another one that I think that's another one canceled, right?

423
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,380
No.

424
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,380
He replaced two on Saturday.

425
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,380
Porter, let's share your story.

426
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,380
Let's talk about...

427
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:31,380
Just share the story of how you lost the clients.

428
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,380
Then we'll go to Saturday.

429
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:37,380
Guys, I know you're not going to be able to see Porter.

430
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,380
I will get that fixed.

431
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:42,380
That's the first thing that Ashley's going to do when she wakes up.

432
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,380
If she's not awake already, zoom.

433
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,380
That's crazy.

434
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:49,380
I apologize, but we're just going to go with this because we want to get the information.

435
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,380
You're going to see me.

436
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,380
You're going to listen to Porter.

437
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,380
Porter, tell the story about how you lost the clients, dude.

438
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,380
Yeah.

439
00:18:55,380 --> 00:19:00,380
The first one, it was actually my first ever client that I landed three years ago, or two

440
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,380
and a half years ago.

441
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,380
Yeah, old nester, dude.

442
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:09,380
Anyways, it was in Concrete, and he was behind three payments.

443
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,380
He always gave the mentality of...

444
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:12,380
He always paid.

445
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,380
I always knew he was going to pay.

446
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,380
He was never on time.

447
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,380
It was always two or three weeks past.

448
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,380
I was like, bro, this is so annoying.

449
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:25,380
I felt like he was almost like that weak link in my business.

450
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:29,380
I was like, dude, how am I supposed to do this if I had five or six of these same guys?

451
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:31,380
I was like, I just got to cut the fat.

452
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:35,380
As hard as it was because I was at 10,000, and I was like, dude, I don't want to drop below.

453
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,380
I was like, he's not paying me anyways.

454
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,380
I'm like, what am I doing?

455
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,380
I'm just sitting here.

456
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:43,380
That guy basically told him, hey, I got to go look for somebody else.

457
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,380
Sorry.

458
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:50,380
The next guy, I literally sent him over a lead, and then he called me or texted me.

459
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:52,380
He's like, hey, when's our four-month contract up?

460
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,380
I was like, oh, it's up.

461
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:58,380
We need to renew it anyways.

462
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,380
He wasn't closing as many jobs anyway.

463
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:03,380
He was one of those business owners where he was satisfied to get the jobs.

464
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,380
He was quoting them high because he was busy.

465
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:10,380
His excuse was, dude, I'm so booked out that I literally can't even take on any more jobs.

466
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,380
I'm basically pointless.

467
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,380
I'm like, well, that's a good thing.

468
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,380
That's what you want.

469
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,380
Anyways, the whole thing, I didn't even try.

470
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,380
Most of the time, I try to make something work.

471
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:23,380
I try to sell through a client and try to say, hey, let's try this.

472
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:26,380
This might really help you if they're not selling type deal.

473
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,380
This one, I was like, you can't really argue with that.

474
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,380
I don't know what to say.

475
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:35,380
That was Saturday of last week.

476
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,380
Both those happened.

477
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:39,380
Two in one day, I was like, are you crapping me?

478
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:43,380
It just takes the breath out of you when you lose two clients like that.

479
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,380
That's how I lost them.

480
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,380
Okay.

481
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:52,380
Porter went from $10,600 per month down to what?

482
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,380
What did that drop you to?

483
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,380
Well, one was $1,200.

484
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,380
The other one was $1,600.

485
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,380
That puts you at $9,400.

486
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,380
You were at $8,800.

487
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,380
Yep.

488
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:06,380
Porter went from $10,600 to $8,800 overnight.

489
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,380
What a way to start a Saturday.

490
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,380
Love that for you, bro.

491
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:11,380
What a great Saturday.

492
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,380
I had no idea this was going on, by the way.

493
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:16,380
Guys, first thing I want to say.

494
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:19,380
First of all, if you don't have clients, get some clients, dude.

495
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,380
Come on.

496
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,380
Let's have some pride.

497
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,380
Do something.

498
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,380
Guys, the other day I got some stuff in the mail.

499
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,380
You know those value packs?

500
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,380
It's called ValPak.

501
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:28,380
Have you guys seen those?

502
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,380
I got that the other day.

503
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,380
I saw the mail.

504
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:32,380
I had an IRS bill.

505
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:36,380
I had my insurance bill, all those bills.

506
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,380
Then I saw this.

507
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,380
I opened it up.

508
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,380
Dude, I went through it.

509
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:46,380
Every single one of the little coupons that was a business, that was a home service business,

510
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,380
I put it on the side.

511
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:50,380
Had a big old stack of them, and I think my kid threw it away.

512
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,380
I think Riggs threw it away.

513
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:56,380
I put it on top of the stair rail to go up to the office, and I can't find it.

514
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,380
But that's a great way.

515
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:00,380
Guys, they're paying for freaking leads.

516
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:02,380
They're paying money to try and get leads.

517
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,380
That's what they're looking for.

518
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,380
Those are great, warm leads.

519
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:09,380
Anyway, I'm just still on my soapbox about the fact that if you don't have a deal, then

520
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,380
shame on you.

521
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,380
If it's been two months you don't have a deal, shame on you.

522
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:16,380
Porter, if you didn't know how to do this process, you didn't know how to run ads,

523
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:20,380
don't you think if you took a list of all the people you know that do concrete, all

524
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:25,380
the people you know that do fencing, all the people you know that do tree service, that

525
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:30,380
if you called them and text them and did something every day in 30 days, you couldn't get a

526
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:31,380
deal?

527
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,380
Oh, for sure.

528
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:35,380
Through your contact list, I guarantee you get a deal.

529
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:37,380
Dude, go through your Facebook friends.

530
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:40,380
Every person that has a company, write it down.

531
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,380
Go buy Hermosy's book.

532
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,380
He talks about it.

533
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,380
He's like, you just reach out to him.

534
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,380
Here's what you say.

535
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:49,380
And guys, it's literally that's how simple it is.

536
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:52,380
If it's been 60 days you don't have a deal, shame on you.

537
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:54,380
Have some pride in yourself.

538
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,380
It's enough is enough.

539
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,380
Guys, we're two months into the year.

540
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:01,380
Now I'm down just getting annoyed that it's on you.

541
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:07,380
Borders using the same training that you guys are using to get deals, to replace deals.

542
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:10,380
So is everybody else out there.

543
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:15,380
Francesca, who doesn't even speak English as her first language.

544
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:20,380
Guys, she came to the US as a 16 year old kid that didn't speak English.

545
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:22,380
She's landing deals.

546
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:25,380
Not with my help, not using me.

547
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:26,380
She's landing deals.

548
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,380
You guys need to land deals.

549
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,380
Have some pride.

550
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,380
It's enough.

551
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,380
It's done.

552
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,380
Okay.

553
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:37,380
So first thing, guys, once you do get deals, just know that you're going to lose a client.

554
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,380
Okay.

555
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,380
I don't care how good it is.

556
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:41,380
I don't care how many good leads you send.

557
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:45,380
I don't care how many, you know, whatever.

558
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:47,380
How many reports you send.

559
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:50,380
How many times you send them a card in the mail.

560
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,380
You're going to lose clients.

561
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,380
That's just the fact of the matter.

562
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,380
Why?

563
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:56,380
Because guys, sometimes these clients, they don't know how to close.

564
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:59,380
And that's not always the case, but that you lose them.

565
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,380
Sometimes it's your fault.

566
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:03,380
But sometimes, guys, they just suck at closing.

567
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,380
They should never be in business in the first place.

568
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,380
They should be working for somebody else.

569
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,380
But you know what?

570
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,380
They chose to be in business and you're going to lose clients.

571
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,380
So just accept the fact that you are going to lose clients.

572
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,380
That's just it.

573
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,380
Okay.

574
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:17,380
So Porter, when that happened, what was your first reaction?

575
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:21,380
Because I've done this before and I've lost clients and it's made me sick.

576
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:23,380
But I'll tell you, it's a lot worse when you're doing SEO.

577
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,380
But go ahead.

578
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,380
What was your first reaction?

579
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,380
What was your thoughts?

580
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,380
What was your feelings?

581
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:30,380
Well, the first reaction, I was kind of like, I was pissed off, first of all,

582
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:32,380
because I was like, this has happened to me before.

583
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:34,380
And I'm like, I'm providing the leads.

584
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:38,380
And you kind of just want to just say, I'm just going to take the day off.

585
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,380
I'm just going to lay in bed.

586
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:41,380
I'm just going to just chill.

587
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,380
I'll start hitting it Monday.

588
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:46,380
But I actually started hooking my clients Saturday.

589
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:49,380
I immediately got on the phone and I started calling business owners because

590
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:53,380
the last time that this happened to me, I remember it took the air out of me.

591
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:56,380
I almost stayed at two or three deals for a couple months because I literally

592
00:24:56,380 --> 00:25:00,380
was being such a pansy about just getting back on the phone.

593
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:04,380
I was taking it so personal that these business owners dropped me.

594
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,380
And this time I just had a better mindset.

595
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,380
I was like, dude, I'm not letting this affect me.

596
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,380
Like 10K is where I'm staying.

597
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,380
I'm not dropping below that.

598
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:13,380
So it was just like the standard of like, I got to stay above this.

599
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:17,380
Like this, you know, you hit something, you're just like, dude, I'm doing this.

600
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:22,380
And it's crazy what you can do when you have like the willpower or just like

601
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:24,380
the, I don't know, the urgency.

602
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:27,380
I don't know if that's like a better word, survival.

603
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,380
In that book, it talks about being like survival.

604
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:32,380
And you're like, when you need to like do something, you will do it.

605
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,380
And that's kind of where I was at.

606
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:36,380
I was like, dude, I got to, I got to get some deals.

607
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:39,380
Yeah, guys, it's just about standards, right?

608
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:43,380
So this is a really simple analogy that I've heard.

609
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,380
You've probably heard a million times.

610
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,380
I'm not trying to pretend it's my own.

611
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,380
It's not original.

612
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:49,380
It's like we have this financial thermostat, right?

613
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:54,380
And how a thermostat works is how the analogy goes is when you have a thermostat

614
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:58,380
set at 70, if it gets to 68, the heat kicks on, right?

615
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,380
You go back to 70.

616
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:04,380
If it gets to 72, the cool, the AC kicks on to go back to 70.

617
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:07,380
We have this thermostat of what we think we're worth.

618
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:12,380
And as soon as we go below it, we're going to do everything we can to get to it.

619
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,380
It's crazy.

620
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:17,380
Like we start scrapping our way and we start going into like, I can't breathe mode.

621
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:21,380
We start going into like, this is the only thing that matters.

622
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,380
Nothing else is important.

623
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:27,380
I got to get back to the certain baseline and you'll do everything.

624
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:29,380
You'll get scrappy, creative, everything.

625
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,380
And the reverse is true, too.

626
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:35,380
You think you're worth 10K a month and you make 15K one month and all of a sudden you

627
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,380
start self-sabotaging.

628
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,380
You start taking the day off.

629
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,380
You start doing all this stuff.

630
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:42,380
So the key is like, how do you get your standard hire?

631
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:46,380
Some of you guys, and I'm not trying to be rude here, but clearly some of you guys have

632
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,380
a standard of making no money, right?

633
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:52,380
Like in this business, your standard is zero because you're not urgent.

634
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:55,380
You're not doing whatever it takes to get a deal.

635
00:26:55,380 --> 00:27:01,380
You're content sitting there watching the training for the third time in a row and

636
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:05,380
tweedling around with your website when you need to just pick up the phone and call

637
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:11,380
somebody or walk into a business or go on Facebook or call your uncle or whatever.

638
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,380
But get a deal.

639
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,380
Make something happen, right?

640
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:16,380
So it's a good point.

641
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:21,380
Once you get to a certain point, guys, and I feel like when you get to these really good,

642
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:24,380
even numbers, like you get to the 10K and you kind of have this identity.

643
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:27,380
And it's really good, too, because everyone wants Porter hit 10K.

644
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,380
We're like, hey, Porter's at 10K.

645
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,380
Last thing he wants to do is drop below 10K.

646
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:32,380
He's now a 10K person, right?

647
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:38,380
When I made seven figures in 2020, it was the weirdest thing in my mind.

648
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:39,380
I was like, oh, I can't go.

649
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:41,380
I can never make less than a million dollars, right?

650
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:45,380
I can never make less than a million dollars no matter what happens.

651
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:49,380
And guys, even like, for example, last year, it was a weird year.

652
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:52,380
A lot of personal stuff took my eye off the ball in some ways.

653
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,380
Maybe you guys saw it.

654
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,380
Maybe you didn't.

655
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,380
But I did.

656
00:27:55,380 --> 00:28:01,380
Even then, I still made far above a million dollars, like well above a million dollars,

657
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:06,380
because even with all the distraction, even with all the personal stuff, I knew, hey,

658
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,380
I don't make less than a million dollars.

659
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:13,380
And so this year, I sat down and I was like, it's time for me to change that standard.

660
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:16,380
Like, a million is no longer even close to acceptable.

661
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:22,380
And the same way that I'm telling you guys you should get annoyed that Porter's at $10,600,

662
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:28,380
$10,700, is I'm looking at people around me that I know that are making a million dollars a month

663
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,380
in one of their businesses.

664
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:32,380
And I'm like, dude, there's nothing different between that guy and me.

665
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,380
Why are they beating me?

666
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,380
What am I doing?

667
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:40,380
Why am I still content at making a couple million bucks when I should be making five figures?

668
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,380
I should be at $10 million a month.

669
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:45,380
I made my first million five years ago, four years ago.

670
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,380
You know, I should be at 10.

671
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:49,380
I should be at 10 plus, period.

672
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,380
What am I doing?

673
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:51,380
What are you doing, Nick?

674
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,380
Big wake up call.

675
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,380
Roll my goals down.

676
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,380
And this year, everything's changing.

677
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,380
Changing my standard.

678
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,380
Getting around different people.

679
00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:06,380
So Porter, how did you how do you think people can change their standard of what they think they're worth?

680
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:11,380
And I don't want to get too much into like this mindset stuff because I want to keep this on tactical stuff.

681
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:18,380
But also, how does somebody that's never gotten a deal or that's barely making two, three thousand, four thousand bucks,

682
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:25,380
barely paying the bills at their regular job, how do they get the mindset of like, hey, I have to I have to make a certain amount?

683
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,380
Like, how do you create that?

684
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,380
How did you get to that point?

685
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,380
It definitely took a little bit of time.

686
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:38,380
I wish I would have gotten there faster because now that you've gotten there, you look back and you're like, if I would have just changed a few of these things,

687
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:50,380
I think the number one thing is I just think I was so analysis paralysis or I was too afraid to like make a jump in like spending money or doing certain things.

688
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:54,380
Like it's like you kind of just dabble, you know, for a while you're just dabbling.

689
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:56,380
You're like, I'm going to run a website, I'm going to run an ad.

690
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,380
And then you're like, I'm going to call a business owner.

691
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,380
I'm also going to call like five of them.

692
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,380
If one of them pick up, I'll do it.

693
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:06,380
But then it becomes like it's like, no, I'm going to do this until I get it.

694
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,380
I'm going to get someone on the hook.

695
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:10,380
And then it's like, no, I'm going to run this ad until I get leads.

696
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:13,380
Like, there's no reason I shouldn't because I've seen it work.

697
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:16,380
And it's like there's too many people in the group.

698
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:26,380
The thing that changed it for me was, again, seeing people in the group get deals that I knew that I thought I was better than them in a humble way.

699
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:28,380
But like I thought I could do better than them.

700
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:39,380
And so I think seeing other people get deals, I knew the process worked, but I knew it was my insecurities and my personal feelings of like what I thought I was capable of.

701
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:41,380
That was the biggest thing holding me back.

702
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:52,380
So I think I honestly for me to get to that point, I think I had to fake it until like I literally had to say, hey, I think I'm worth this, even though I necessarily don't feel like I am, but I'm going to be this.

703
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,380
Like, you know what I'm saying?

704
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:56,380
Like, that's kind of what you have to do until you feel that way.

705
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,380
Yeah, I agree.

706
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:06,380
And another thing, guys, another thing that will really help you is getting around people that are making a lot more money than you.

707
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:11,380
And I'm not saying that that should be the only thing that you look for in friends, right?

708
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:14,380
Because if they're just crappy human beings, that may not be worth it.

709
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:16,380
But we are talking about money in this group.

710
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:22,380
This group is not necessarily a group we're talking about, you know, whatever.

711
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,380
We're talking about money.

712
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,380
We're talking about money.

713
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:39,380
So in that regard, guys, one of the easiest ways to really get your standards changed or really to shake up your to really mind after yourself is start getting around people that are making way more money than you.

714
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:40,380
Right.

715
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,380
Because all of a sudden you start to see the way that they live their lives.

716
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:48,380
You start to see the way that they don't even think about the decisions they make aren't based on price.

717
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:52,380
They're based on convenience and time and, you know, things like that.

718
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:58,380
Like, I remember when I started hanging out with one of my only friends, I don't have a lot of friends that I really hang out with one of my only friends.

719
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:01,380
And I started to make I was starting to make a little bit of money.

720
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:07,380
I think this is around I actually became friends with them before I made my first seven figures.

721
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:15,380
But I remember that the first time I made some decent money, he's we went to Mexico and I'm like, so where are we going to stay?

722
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:16,380
And he just sent me the link.

723
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:23,380
He's like, I booked here and I pulled it up and it was like, you know, five hundred six hundred bucks a night, not all inclusive.

724
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,380
This is just for the room.

725
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:30,380
And I was like, you know, obviously, it can't be I got to just I can't say, oh, let's go somewhere cheaper.

726
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:31,380
I'm like, all right.

727
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:34,380
So, you know, I went there for like a five, six days.

728
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:37,380
It was like two, three, twenty five hundred three thousand dollars.

729
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:42,380
And I was like, dude, if I want to continue to be this guy's friend where I get invited to go to do stuff.

730
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:50,380
I mean, the guy's talking about like, hey, I don't let's just let's just split a private plane to go down there so we can just go straight out of, you know, St.

731
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:51,380
George Airport.

732
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:53,380
He started to make these kind of comments.

733
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:55,380
I got me like, OK, I got it.

734
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,380
I got to pull my head out.

735
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:57,380
What am I doing?

736
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:02,380
I'm sitting over here thinking I'm hot crap making, you know, a hundred grand a month.

737
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,380
This dude's making a million dollars a month.

738
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:05,380
Like, I got to step this thing up.

739
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:11,380
So, guys, you start getting around people that are making a lot more than you.

740
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:17,380
I guess I should say this, they have higher standards than you and you are naturally going to have higher standards.

741
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:18,380
Porter, how do you do that?

742
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:21,380
Because Porter lives in a town.

743
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:25,380
And by the way, there's some people in this in that town that are in this group.

744
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,380
And guys, welcome.

745
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,380
I know there's a couple of you guys that joined recently.

746
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:29,380
Dakota.

747
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:32,380
I don't know if you're on here, Dakota, but if you are, welcome, dude.

748
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:35,380
He's in a town where there's some people that are doing some things.

749
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:40,380
But a lot of the people, I would say the average income in that town, it's got to be like four grand.

750
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,380
Right.

751
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,380
Maybe monthly.

752
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:44,380
Maybe maybe four to six grand.

753
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:51,380
And people are really content with that, which in some ways I actually really respect because it's like, yeah, money doesn't make you happy.

754
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,380
I get that.

755
00:33:52,380 --> 00:34:01,380
But it's also it's tough when you're around that type of people all the time that like you're the big frickin dog, man.

756
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,380
You're you're making 10 grand, dude.

757
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:07,380
You know, your your donation at church is fat, dude.

758
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:11,380
And it's like, no, you're tricking little small chimp.

759
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,380
You're like, you're just a little fish.

760
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:13,380
Right.

761
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:15,380
And I'm the same way compared to a lot of people, too.

762
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:16,380
How do you do that?

763
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:24,380
How do you how do you have the high standard of, you know, hey, by the way, Porter, 10 grand, you're still making baby money, bro.

764
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:25,380
Let's go.

765
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,380
I know.

766
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,380
You are, dude.

767
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:28,380
Come on.

768
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:29,380
I mean, let's see.

769
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:30,380
Twenty.

770
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:31,380
What are you?

771
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:32,380
Twenty five.

772
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:33,380
Yeah, it is unacceptable.

773
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,380
Twenty five, twelve.

774
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:36,380
So you're like you're ripping like 120 a year.

775
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:38,380
I mean, dude, at twenty five, I'd be like two hundred and ten.

776
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,380
Just no.

777
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:43,380
I mean, throw your face a little bit, a little bit, a little salt in the wound.

778
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:44,380
You got it.

779
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,380
You get you're not.

780
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:46,380
You got to pick this up, dude.

781
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:47,380
Twenty K.

782
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:49,380
Then we can start, you know, flexing a tiny bit.

783
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,380
But how do you do it, bro?

784
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:57,380
Because I know that what it's like, like and that's one of the reasons I like to be around people that are successful.

785
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:59,380
That's one of the reasons I like to be in Dubai.

786
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:02,380
I look around. I'm like, dude, every other person's got a frickin Lambo.

787
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:05,380
I don't know if it's drug money, but nonetheless, they got cash.

788
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:09,380
Dinner, seven hundred and fifty dollars for two people.

789
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,380
That's you got to have cash.

790
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:16,380
What what do you do when you live around people that are at a lower standard to raise the standard?

791
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:22,380
I think I try to do that that same mindset, but it's got to be online.

792
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:24,380
It's got to be within the group.

793
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:28,380
It's got to be like I'm rubbing shoulders with with obviously you.

794
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:34,380
I talked to Jeff like you talked to Francesca like you just talked to people that you know are making money or landing deals constantly.

795
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:36,380
Like Mahmood making good money.

796
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:38,380
And it just kind of just makes you wait.

797
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:41,380
Sixty five K a month. He doesn't talk that he doesn't.

798
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:43,380
Yeah, as much as that sixty five K a month.

799
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:44,380
He's a sleeper. Keep going.

800
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:47,380
Yeah. But like that, it's just like, dude, these guys are making a lot of money.

801
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:51,380
So it's like I have to like be around those people in the group.

802
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:58,380
So like, yeah, if you can't be there physically, try to be there, you know, socially on their rub shoulders with them.

803
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:03,380
Comment like I for the longest time, I hated posting because I just didn't want you.

804
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:05,380
You don't know. You don't want people to know you.

805
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,380
You know what I'm saying?

806
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:08,380
Like, especially I'm your brother, too.

807
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:10,380
So I'm like kind of like hiding back and whatever.

808
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:12,380
And then I'm like, you know, then you kind of change.

809
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:15,380
You're like, what's so bad about people knowing your business in a way?

810
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,380
You know what I'm saying?

811
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,380
You kind of switch the mindset.

812
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:24,380
And so I think as soon as I started doing that, I kind of just was like it was like this eye opening thing.

813
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:29,380
It's crazy when you really start to think that you're you're actually this like right now.

814
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:36,380
But you're a big fish in a small pond, but but you're really a small fish and, you know, a massive pond, right?

815
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:37,380
That's kind of what you need to be.

816
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:44,380
So I just try to do it online and the Facebook group post be around people that can motivate you.

817
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:49,380
Yeah, guys, that's one of the reasons that you you maybe you didn't even join for this reason.

818
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:55,380
But this is one of the best things about this community is think about where we all came from.

819
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,380
We all have our lives. We're all in our situations.

820
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,380
We're all surrounded by people that are living average lives.

821
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:02,380
Maybe we were in the free Facebook group.

822
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:05,380
Maybe you came from the school community, you know, whatever.

823
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:11,380
And we basically sucked all the people out of there that are ready to do this for real.

824
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:14,380
Right. And so we filtered everyone out.

825
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:17,380
And these are the people in this group that are here to do this for real.

826
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:20,380
And you are surrounded by all the winners.

827
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:24,380
Right. Ma Moon's making sixty five thousand dollars a month.

828
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:26,380
Mike V's making forty thousand dollars a month.

829
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:30,380
These are U.S. numbers, by the way.

830
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:32,380
I'm not going to say this guy's name, because I don't know if he wants me to.

831
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:34,380
But there's a guy that just joined. This is not Ryan Dalton.

832
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:36,380
He makes one hundred and twenty thousand dollars per month.

833
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:39,380
He's not talking much, but he's in the group. He just joined.

834
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:42,380
We got Ryan Dalton six hundred thousand dollars a month.

835
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:46,380
Jeff, I don't know what Jeff's at. Twenty thousand plus.

836
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:50,380
Levi's at fifteen thousand plus. Jason's at fourteen something.

837
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:53,380
Stephanie's at, by the way, shout out to Stephanie, twelve thousand nine hundred.

838
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:56,380
There's Juan Finesse's at forty thousand plus.

839
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:58,380
Russ Ether's at forty thousand plus.

840
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:03,380
Guys, you are surrounded by people that are making some freaking cheddar in this group.

841
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:06,380
So go and be of value to these people.

842
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:09,380
Do not message them and say, hey, can I jump on the phone with you?

843
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:12,380
Because I'm going to not let them. OK, they're not going to.

844
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:14,380
But like, add some value.

845
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:19,380
If you see one of them post and you have an answer or you find something valuable, share it with them.

846
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:22,380
Go and make yourself known. You don't have to be super loud.

847
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:24,380
But like Porter's been doing a really good job.

848
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:28,380
He's been sharing his wins, sharing where he's at, sharing his losses. Right.

849
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,380
And then people can say they know who he is.

850
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:34,380
And that's not a bad thing, because now Porter's like, I'm the 10K guy.

851
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:37,380
Well, if you're at eight today, we'd just be freaking roasting you, dude.

852
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:41,380
You can't go below ten. Right. You can't go below.

853
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:46,380
Guys, go read freaking Porter. Tell these guys about slight edge.

854
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:49,380
I had Porter start the slight edge. Give it give it a review.

855
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:51,380
What are you on page like 80?

856
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:55,380
Yeah, I'm on page like 80. But it's it's totally like when you first like the first.

857
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:59,380
It's one of those books that it's not you don't have to wait a few chapters to get into it.

858
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:03,380
It's like it like hits hard and like the first couple of pages.

859
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:06,380
Like it's insane. Right. Yeah.

860
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:08,380
It is so cool. But it just makes you like this.

861
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:12,380
It's all your mindset. And it's like you already know what to freaking do, guys.

862
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:15,380
It's just us. Yeah. You just got it. It's all these little things.

863
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:21,380
Guys, if you want to skip to a chapter talking about this, this specific topic of, you know,

864
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:25,380
learning a specific skill, Chapter 13 talks about mentors.

865
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:27,380
And that's anyway, just as a quick note.

866
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:31,380
And I know that because I've been recommending this book to a lot of people recommending certain chapters,

867
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:33,380
screenshotting pieces.

868
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:38,380
This is just a very simple book about a simple strategy that if you'll just do these things,

869
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:40,380
guys, everything's going to change for you.

870
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,380
Like just simple stuff. Reading 10 pages a day.

871
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:46,380
Just all like just these little tiny things. Right.

872
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:48,380
If depending on what your goals are.

873
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:52,380
For me, it's like I need to make a post every single day on certain social media channels.

874
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:55,380
I need to do.

875
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:57,380
I mean, obviously the gym to me.

876
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:59,380
That's just the standard at this point.

877
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:01,380
I need to make a certain amount of money.

878
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:05,380
But in order to make that certain amount of money, I have to do these little tiny things.

879
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:08,380
So guys, go freaking just just 10 pages on your phone every day.

880
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:10,380
What does it take you 10 minutes?

881
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:12,380
Oh, not even that.

882
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:16,380
You know, sometimes like yesterday I was eating Chipotle after the gym, which that's it.

883
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,380
That was a decision, right?

884
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:24,380
Like, hey, I'm going to eat this 600, 700 calorie bowl instead of going and smashing Buffalo Wild Wings and waking up groggy.

885
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,380
You know what I mean? Like those little tiny things.

886
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:28,380
Drinking water. I stopped drinking soda.

887
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:30,380
I stopped drinking energy drinks.

888
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:32,380
Right. These are little tiny things.

889
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:34,380
I started focusing on my sleep.

890
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:36,380
Shout out to the whoop and Christiano Ronaldo.

891
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:38,380
Your boys get that dialed in sleep.

892
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:40,380
These are all little things that are contributing.

893
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:42,380
Anyway, guys, so we're going to get back into the tactical.

894
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:45,380
So I just wanted to go on a little soapbox on that, but go check out that book.

895
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:53,380
So guys, to raise that mindset, get around people to raise the standard, get around people that are making a lot more money than you.

896
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:55,380
And this group is a perfect way to do it.

897
00:40:55,380 --> 00:41:04,380
You can do it by getting on these calls and listening to the mindset, listening to the like, you know, people that have, you know, options, people that have freedom.

898
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:06,380
You get around that. It gets infectious.

899
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:09,380
They have the ability to go and do stuff that you can't.

900
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:11,380
And it's exciting and it should piss you off a little bit.

901
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:14,380
So, okay, Porter, let's talk about what you did.

902
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:20,380
So as soon as you got the news that you're losing the deals, you decided.

903
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:23,380
So you actually got the news on Saturday morning that you lost the deals.

904
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:25,380
Or does it Friday?

905
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:27,380
No, it was Saturday morning, dude.

906
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:28,380
It was the chitiest Saturday, dude.

907
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:32,380
My heart hurt. It was like my dog died or something, dude.

908
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:34,380
It's so sad, dude.

909
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:37,380
And it's worse when you have kids because you're like your kids.

910
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:41,380
You're like, dude, that just took some opportunity out of my.

911
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:44,380
We could have taken a little forward to Disney.

912
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:46,380
You know, dude, I felt so bad a little bit.

913
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:47,380
Okay.

914
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:54,380
So so you got the news on both or you the one you kind of knew was coming, but the one you hit hit you on Saturday, right?

915
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:56,380
Yeah. So it was like one.

916
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:58,380
I was like, okay, I could drop below a little bit.

917
00:41:58,380 --> 00:41:59,380
Right. And then.

918
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:01,380
And so I had so I had one deal that was going to be a new deal.

919
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:04,380
So I was working on him. I had a business owner hooked.

920
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:08,380
Then I decided to just cut the cut the fat with the other guy.

921
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:13,380
And then, bam, Saturday morning, three business owners that I was like, she is broke.

922
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:17,380
Okay. So so this is an important thing, guys.

923
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:19,380
Well, soon as Porter lost the deal, he got right on it.

924
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:22,380
He got pissed off instead of being like, oh, what was me?

925
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:26,380
Oh, my. I'm a victim. Oh, oh, of course.

926
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:30,380
The Porter, you know, guys, everyone's lost deals, dude.

927
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:32,380
I lost a four thousand dollar deal at SeaWorld.

928
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:34,380
And I was making eight grand a month.

929
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:37,380
Like, dude, that's that's when you go.

930
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:40,380
That's when you're like, yeah, I don't know about that churro.

931
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:42,380
You can't tell that you can't tell wifey.

932
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:43,380
You can't tell the kids they can't have the churro.

933
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:45,380
But you're like, how am I going to pay for that?

934
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:46,380
Pay for the churro.

935
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:50,380
The churro is like eight bucks, dude, pretty pricey.

936
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:51,380
We're going back for round two.

937
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:52,380
You know what I'm saying?

938
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:56,380
It goes a long way when you just lost a four thousand dollar client.

939
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:58,380
Been there, bro.

940
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:01,380
First and foremost, guys, you this is why you build assets.

941
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:03,380
This is why you don't do you don't trade time for dollars.

942
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:06,380
You build assets because now Porter's like, OK, screw you, Bob.

943
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:08,380
Screw you. What's his name?

944
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:10,380
Nestor, dude. Yeah.

945
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:13,380
Screw you, Nestor. I feel like I had.

946
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:14,380
I feel like I worked with a guy named Nestor.

947
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:16,380
I think it was probably my old client.

948
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:18,380
Screw you, Nestor. I'm going to go to somebody else.

949
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:21,380
He just jumped on it. He used the pit.

950
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:23,380
He was pissed off and he used it to go get a client.

951
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:25,380
What did you do? Did you even have any leads to send?

952
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:27,380
Did you like did you just start rip?

953
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:30,380
Like did you have your old list or what was the first thing you did?

954
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:32,380
You go lock yourself in your office. You go on a drive.

955
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:33,380
How did you make the calls?

956
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:35,380
So, yeah, dude, I do.

957
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:38,380
So, dude, I could just rip calls in the truck, dude.

958
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:43,380
So I just get in the V10, the gas log, dude, and I start trailing the farm roads, dude.

959
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:47,380
And then I was taking these leads because this guy wasn't calling these leads because he was so booked out.

960
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:49,380
So that was the one guy.

961
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:53,380
So I was literally calling leads back like weeks and weeks.

962
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,380
And some of these were like, yeah, I'd love a quote.

963
00:43:55,380 --> 00:44:00,380
So I sent over like two one day and then like I waited a little bit, sent another two.

964
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:03,380
So it was fast. That one was to cake.

965
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:05,380
And the other one, this one was a little bit slower.

966
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:07,380
This one was Nestor, the one I got.

967
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:10,380
So I called some of his leads that he had already quoted.

968
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:14,380
And I was like, hey, like I work with a couple of different contractors, whatever, me and this other guy working together.

969
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:18,380
But I could also send you another guy like I don't want to step on anyone's toes.

970
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:21,380
But like I could give you another option. And they're like, yeah, send them over.

971
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:27,380
So I sent them over the same lead and I let the business owner know because I didn't want him thinking I was giving this to two different guys.

972
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:31,380
But I was like, you know, I was working with this other guy, whatever. He didn't have a problem with it.

973
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:34,380
So anyways, that's what I was doing. But yeah, I was I just went in my truck, dude.

974
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:38,380
I just was like, I got to go take a little breather. And I just and I had a list already.

975
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:43,380
So I knew that like I had it already prepared because I think I hooked one of the guys like that first client I had.

976
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:46,380
It was the first call I did. So I had this whole list ready.

977
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:49,380
So I just went and started making calls right after.

978
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:52,380
Dude, one one little hack, guys, is I agree.

979
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:56,380
I definitely recommend you do your closing calls from your Zoom.

980
00:44:56,380 --> 00:45:04,380
But for some reason, getting in your car and driving around and doing calls, I think it's because you're not this is not safe.

981
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:14,380
I'm not saying this is the top safety protocol here, but use your Bluetooth, whatever I get in the freaking Tesla, dude, just I recline that seat like I'm basically about to take a nap.

982
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:17,380
And, dude, I got the thing on on the Bluetooth.

983
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:25,380
And, dude, for some reason, being distracted and looking at the way I'm driving, I'm so much more calm like I'm not.

984
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:27,380
Don't get me wrong. I'm still sweating.

985
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:32,380
I'm still freaking pouring sweat down my back and my face when I'm calling, even doing it this long.

986
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:40,380
Sometimes for some of you guys that are terrified, jump in your car, go on a drive and just take your list with you and call them while you're driving.

987
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:41,380
Call them while you're walking.

988
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:45,380
Try to distract yourself a little bit like that and it will help you a lot.

989
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:46,380
Sometimes I get it when you're sitting at your desk.

990
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:50,380
It's really nervous. You're sitting there taking your feet and you're like, I don't know.

991
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:53,380
But if you're moving and doing something, it seems to help.

992
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:57,380
So Porter, thank goodness he followed the process, right?

993
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:58,380
He had the list already built.

994
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,380
He knew who we wanted to contact.

995
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:06,380
One thing that I like that you did, he went and called some of the old leads that he that the guy never quoted or the guy never closed.

996
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:09,380
Whatever the guy's not paying him this this guy Nestor.

997
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:11,380
So it's like he's not obligated to do anything.

998
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:13,380
He went and called him and he hustled.

999
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:16,380
He didn't say, well, I'm going to wait for some more leads to come in.

1000
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:17,380
He just went and called him.

1001
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:21,380
So how do you what's the pitch like to a business owner?

1002
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:23,380
You have somebody you know they're going to cancel.

1003
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:25,380
You can just see it.

1004
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:26,380
You can smell it, right?

1005
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:27,380
They missed a few payments.

1006
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:28,380
They're a little unhappy.

1007
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:30,380
You've got a Zoom scheduled next Thursday.

1008
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:32,380
They want to review things.

1009
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:33,380
You have a good feeling.

1010
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:35,380
You kind of know they're going to cancel at some point.

1011
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:38,380
How what do you say to the new when you're calling the new list?

1012
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:43,380
What do you say to the business owner that's different than when you don't have a business owner?

1013
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:49,380
I guess the only I guess I ask him different questions.

1014
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:56,380
I think it's like, OK, that business owner that I just lost, what is one quality that that they have that I didn't know they had?

1015
00:46:56,380 --> 00:47:00,380
You know, when I started working with them, so I think I started I asked a little bit better questions.

1016
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:06,380
Like maybe it's like, hey, like I really started to focus on like, hey, how much you make and how long you've been a business.

1017
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:10,380
Like, I think that was his problem was he just wasn't making a lot of money.

1018
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:12,380
Like he wasn't he didn't have any source of lead flow.

1019
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:16,380
It was just me, which, yeah, you're fine with just doing this.

1020
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:21,380
But like most other guys have their own brand or mouth, all these different things.

1021
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:25,380
And so like one of the guys I quoted, dude, this is hilarious.

1022
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:30,380
I got on the phone with him and he I was like, hey, how much are you making like per month?

1023
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:33,380
And he's like, two. And I was like, like, two hundred thousand.

1024
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:36,380
He's like, no, two million. And then I was like, OK.

1025
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:42,380
And then he's like, hold on, give me one sec. And he walks out of his house and he's like, sorry, you mean my wife for going through divorce.

1026
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:45,380
I don't want her to see the numbers. I don't want to hear that.

1027
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:48,380
Somebody you're working with. Yeah, this is one of my clients, dude.

1028
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:51,380
He was hilarious. So dogs make it two mil.

1029
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:53,380
And you thought he was making way less. Yeah.

1030
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:57,380
And so I literally I was like, because you just don't know, like you talked to him on the phone.

1031
00:47:57,380 --> 00:48:00,380
You're like, this guy is probably making a couple hundred thousand a year.

1032
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:02,380
Right. And this guy takes me outside.

1033
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:07,380
He's flexing all he's got, like, three fifties, like trailers, like everything.

1034
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:10,380
And so in my mind, I was like, dude, I think I'd get a little bit more.

1035
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:13,380
But I was like, I'm not going to be greedy. Like, this is what it's going to be worth.

1036
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:16,380
Right. And so I quoted him like fifteen hundred dollars.

1037
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:18,380
And, dude, he didn't even bat an eye. He's like, that sounds good.

1038
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:21,380
He's like, honestly, I probably won't even know what's coming out.

1039
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:25,380
That's awesome. Just got or somebody you got before.

1040
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:28,380
No, this is the client that I got Saturday.

1041
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:33,380
I love that. Guys, if you could ever get your business owners talking like that and they like to flex a little bit,

1042
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:36,380
let them flex, stroke the ego a little bit.

1043
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:40,380
And also, even though they're making a bunch of money, yeah, you might be able to charge them a little bit more.

1044
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:43,380
But also, I'm a big believer of leaving some meat on the bone.

1045
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:48,380
Charge a fair price because you could go back to that client and get the second, third, fourth, fifth deal.

1046
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:51,380
So really good things that I want to point out there.

1047
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:55,380
OK, Gina says we are getting deals. I love Gina's got a little pride.

1048
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:58,380
She's like, Nick, you're talking smack. I'm over here getting deals.

1049
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:02,380
She says we have deals in the works right now. We're on track for our quarter one goals.

1050
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:04,380
This is perfect timing because we do need to replace a business owner.

1051
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:06,380
We'll post some wins. I love it. Post some wins.

1052
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:10,380
I would love to hear about it, Gina. Sean Sean says Gina is super scrappy.

1053
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:14,380
I love that. Porter, get close to the mic.

1054
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:17,380
Well, that was a little late, but Porter, get close to the mic.

1055
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:20,380
I don't think you have. Porter, you need to get yourself a mic, dude.

1056
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:23,380
No, I know. You have those lights still that I gave you?

1057
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:25,380
Yeah, I got them. Are you using them right now?

1058
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:29,380
No, I haven't got them on.

1059
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:33,380
Get yourself a blue yeti. A hundred bucks, dude.

1060
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:35,380
Listen to this. This is awesome. Nick Kudlik.

1061
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:39,380
His warm network is what got me to $9,300 a month.

1062
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:42,380
Nick Kudlik is somebody you guys don't know because he doesn't post.

1063
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:45,380
Frickin' post, Nick, I want people to know about you.

1064
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:52,380
This dude's been just working his warm network and behind-the-scenes silent killer is at $9,300 a month.

1065
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:56,380
And I think he even lost the deal. I think he got over $10K just using his warm network.

1066
00:49:56,380 --> 00:50:00,380
You have deals in your back pocket, guys. Go fricking hit them up.

1067
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:05,380
You guys know all the people with like the Mary Kay and the doTERRA and the Sensei and all these things.

1068
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:10,380
Dude, you got some of these housewives that are hustling harder than you guys.

1069
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:14,380
Frickin' running these shows, dude. Selling Tupperware, making more money than some of you guys.

1070
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:17,380
And you guys are actually selling something that can make them money, okay?

1071
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:22,380
Go get scrappy. I'm not saying to send a fricking Facebook post that says, hey, you'd be a great...

1072
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:26,380
No. Follow the process the best that you can, but you got people in your warm network.

1073
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:31,380
Okay, my mood. Agree, Porter. You got to hook a better B.O. immediately.

1074
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:33,380
Otherwise, your heartbreak will live in your head rent-free.

1075
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:36,380
A hundred percent. You got to take action quick. You got to use that...

1076
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:40,380
Guys, whenever I was on the doors and I would get a no, I would never take a break, dude.

1077
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:44,380
It was like next door. And I would take out all my anger on that door.

1078
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:49,380
And even if I didn't do anything, it was like I felt good because I was like, no, I own that door.

1079
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:54,380
They weren't interested. They weren't telling me, no, I fricking just boss that door, okay?

1080
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:58,380
Sean Sean said, Gina and I lost a $1,400 offense client yesterday, but we're not crying.

1081
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:01,380
The site brought 30 leads in January and over 30 leads this month.

1082
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:03,380
That deal is going to be awesome.

1083
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:07,380
I'm back on the phone today and excited that I will help another offense contractor make some serious money.

1084
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:12,380
Exactly. And that's the beautiful thing, guys, is you have assets that are paying you 30 leads a month, dude.

1085
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:17,380
That that's you could I think you guys could charge up with fencing 30 leads.

1086
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:21,380
That's a $2,000 a month deal. You guys can count it as a win.

1087
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:23,380
Get him under a six month contract. Good to go.

1088
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:26,380
Okay, Laura Shepard, Adair said, What's the book?

1089
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:31,380
Slide Edge. Read it. Do 10 pages a day. It's taking me about a month.

1090
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:35,380
I'll probably finish it this week. And it's phenomenal.

1091
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:39,380
Okay, Adair says I just lost a $3,000 a month deal from SEO.

1092
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:42,380
They hired in-house and let me go. Had that happen, my $4,000 a month.

1093
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:45,380
Same thing. They're like, yeah, I can pay somebody to bring them in-house.

1094
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:49,380
Okay, Porter, what's your what's your current status?

1095
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:51,380
You got another client on the hook?

1096
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:55,380
I got another one on the hook. I've sent him one lead so far.

1097
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:59,380
I kind of put him on the back burner just because I really want to replace these two clients.

1098
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:01,380
So he's still in the works. Message him.

1099
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:05,380
I told him, hey, it's not personal. I'm just busy this last week.

1100
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:08,380
So this week, as soon as I get some leads, going to pass them over, going to close them.

1101
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:14,380
Also, I will say I was nervous to get these people on the phone because one of these clients,

1102
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:19,380
the guy that was making $2,000 a year, I didn't feel like I'd send them enough leads.

1103
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:21,380
Like, you know, you ever get to that point where you're like, I don't know,

1104
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:26,380
because if you don't send them enough leads or you don't gain enough trust, they just won't.

1105
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:29,380
There'll be objection after objection. So I was nervous.

1106
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:33,380
But that Friday, I was like, and you had talked about, you're like, dude, you got to have deals on the weekend.

1107
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:36,380
I was like, dude, I'm just going to send it because if they're going to say no,

1108
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:40,380
I need to find somebody today and get something else rolling.

1109
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:42,380
So anyways, I'm really glad that I pushed that client.

1110
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:45,380
The other one, I'd send him really good leads. I was really confident in.

1111
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:48,380
But this one, I was like, I don't know, it could go either way.

1112
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:54,380
But I'm sure glad I did because I did send him enough leads and I felt like I communicated enough that he wanted that.

1113
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:58,380
So don't be afraid. Take imperfect action because, dude, it doesn't need to be perfect.

1114
00:52:58,380 --> 00:52:59,380
Everybody's different.

1115
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:03,380
I love that. I've sent people one.

1116
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:06,380
There's people I've closed. I sent one lead.

1117
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:11,380
I sent one lead. They didn't even, not only did they not close it, they didn't even quote it.

1118
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:15,380
But that was enough. Guys, sometimes when you do this long enough, you start to feel it in your gut.

1119
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:18,380
You start hearing things they're saying. They're really friendly with you.

1120
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:20,380
They're talking about working together in the future.

1121
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:22,380
You kind of start to get these like little cues.

1122
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:25,380
You just got to go for it, even though you don't feel 100 percent confident.

1123
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:29,380
Sometimes one lead is all they needed because they might have done it without a lead.

1124
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:31,380
That was just the cherry on top.

1125
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:37,380
So, guys, in closing, because it's eight o'clock, it's eight o'clock MST and we've got to go make some money.

1126
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:41,380
I got 20 minutes with the kids and I'm back here for the next eight hours at this desk.

1127
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:45,380
Guys, if you have clients that are not paying you, don't accept it.

1128
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:48,380
Go find a new client. If you have clients that aren't paying you enough, don't accept it.

1129
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:51,380
If you've got clients that are freaking playing around with you, dancing around with you,

1130
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:56,380
remember that you guys are the ones that have the quote, you know, the golden rule quote.

1131
00:53:56,380 --> 00:53:58,380
They say, do unto others.

1132
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:02,380
And then the real golden quote is like the person that has the gold makes the rules, right?

1133
00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:05,380
