My advice, by the way, guys, if you guys are brand new and you have a campaign going and

00:06.100 --> 00:11.300
it's like not hitting or you're waiting and the ads aren't consistent or it's not whatever,

00:11.300 --> 00:14.860
go get a couple, go keep doing due diligence, get a couple of them up.

00:14.860 --> 00:20.380
And then as soon as one starts to pop off, you can pause the other two, okay?

00:20.380 --> 00:25.020
If an ad campaign is set up and running, but it's not getting impressions and it's not

00:25.020 --> 00:29.120
getting clicks, or if it's not getting clicks, it's not costing you, okay?

00:29.120 --> 00:32.860
So get a couple up and just make sure to watch it like a hawk so you don't go spend a bunch

00:32.860 --> 00:36.200
of money that you don't have or that you don't want to spend.

00:36.200 --> 00:39.020
And then you can pause them and just focus on the one.
