00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
I got three things. You got content, we got backlinks, and we have age of domain.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,400
We're going to show you how to find all those things, how to assess all those things,

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,880
how to audit all those things, how to do all those things.

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:13,120
Those are the things that's the 80-20 principle.

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,120
That's the 20 percent of things that give you 80 percent of the results.

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,280
So all these other things that we're going to teach you, they do matter.

7
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,440
OK, and we're going to do them.

8
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,360
We're going to make sure we do them correctly.

9
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,920
But remember, fundamentally, if we can do those things better than everybody else

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,640
that we can control, because we can't control the age,

11
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,960
we can do those other two better than everybody else, we will win the game.

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,920
And especially if we're going against competition, that is not that great.
