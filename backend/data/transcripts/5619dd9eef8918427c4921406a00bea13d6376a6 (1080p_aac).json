{"text": " Okay, Franco says question, how many campaigns should we launch simultaneously when starting out to increase chances? So this is my rule of thumb, Franco really, really quick answer is, as long as you're not going to trigger, you know, whatever, Google to spend your account, doesn't matter how many you start as long as what I what I my rule of thumb is like if you have five that are set up right now right as soon as they start going popping off. I like to have like I would recommend in the beginning having one that's going so if you want to set up five and then have the ads on and then all of a sudden once one takes off you pause the other great. What I don't recommend is having five or 10 I know you guys want to get like some of you guys want to be at 50k today, which I love. But you also got to realize that you just started, and you got to, like, you got to take these steps, there's going to be steps to get there. And so, you can't short like you're not going to shortcut you still got to put in the work so don't go set up 10 campaigns and be spending all this money you're going to chase, if you're chasing I hate this saying but like you chase multiple rabbits you don't catch any right. So, I've noticed there's a threshold for me even that is very very I'm very good at managing multiple campaigns. When I get over five. I get it. I stopped giving attention to each campaign, and it in it, it kills me quite it kills me period. Okay. So my advice is if you're on your first deal. Okay, and if it's not producing get another one set up and then once if the first one starts producing pause the second one. Okay, go get one folks on one period if you guys have ever been in a situation where have you guys ever been in a situation where you have like three deals and they all end up lining up on the same deal. And you're so excited that you rush through the first one and you just barely miss it but you're like, ah, it's okay because I'm going to go on this other one. And then you get on the other one, and you kind of do the same thing and then all of a sudden you're at the end of the day and all three of them were like, eight out of 10 but none of them will close right sucks. The same exact thing like sometimes I if I feel too overwhelmed. I'll just schedule one sales call and that day if I'm feeling really tired or whatever, give all my energy I'll close it, I'll schedule the next one the next day because I want to focus on that one. Okay, so anyway, that should answer your question, set up one. Close it. Then once you're comfortable getting a deal with one, go to two, and go to three, and I would say the threshold as of right now with what I've experienced it's like four to five, but I've been I've been doing this for two years.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 27.0, "text": " Okay, Franco says question, how many campaigns should we launch simultaneously when starting out to increase chances?
