Nick would how often would you say you set up an ad in a niche and it never starts generating leads ratio between number of

00:05.200 --> 00:07.200
ads set up to ones that become sellable

00:07.360 --> 00:09.360
It does happen. Um

00:09.840 --> 00:15.200
It's not happened a ton for me. So if you guys follow the due diligence process follow the metrics

00:16.640 --> 00:17.600
You

00:17.600 --> 00:24.000
Most likely will generate leads now. I will say that I have in the past been a little aggressive gotten a little cocky

00:24.800 --> 00:30.000
Decided to test things out and i've gotten to where you know, i'm i'm doing stuff

00:30.000 --> 00:34.800
It's a little too high on the cpc. I'm like, oh well if it's five bucks that seven is fine

00:35.280 --> 00:40.080
Or ten is fine. I've also gone into markets that are really small just to test out

00:40.560 --> 00:43.840
So it will happen, but it shouldn't be happening very often. I would say

00:44.560 --> 00:46.560
like maybe uh less than

00:47.360 --> 00:51.520
You know probably less than 15 percent of the time if you're having that happen on 50 percent of your campaigns

00:51.520 --> 00:54.260
Then you're you're missing a step on selecting the niche
