00:00.000 --> 00:02.200
How do we fix this? How do you fix it number one?

00:02.200 --> 00:06.080
You need to identify what it is to start as you start making some of you don't know what it is

00:06.080 --> 00:09.440
By the way, you listen this like I don't know what it is. That's good. You haven't made enough offers

00:09.920 --> 00:14.800
That's your first problem. If you don't know what your thing is, you need to start doing more shit

00:14.800 --> 00:18.000
You're not asking enough people for enough money. You're not doing enough calls

00:18.400 --> 00:25.000
Okay, once you do enough calls, you're gonna figure out real quick. What that thing is for you. Now, here's how you solve it

00:25.880 --> 00:27.800
very simply

00:27.800 --> 00:31.640
You start doing the very thing you're asking people to do

00:32.640 --> 00:35.280
If you keep getting I need to talk to my partner. I

00:36.200 --> 00:37.880
Need to talk to my wife

00:37.880 --> 00:42.520
Go talk to your partner. Go talk to your wife. Hey partner. Hey wife. Do you trust me?

00:43.240 --> 00:49.360
If something comes across my desk, that's at least actually, you know, whatever blah blah blah blah. Are you good if I make that decision?

00:50.000 --> 00:55.120
Yes or no, okay, cool get on the same page overcome it if you have an issue with contracts

00:55.440 --> 01:02.400
You got to unfuck your mind because guys life is contracts you have a house you have a car you have a cell phone you have

01:02.840 --> 01:06.040
All these different things like life is literally contracts

01:06.040 --> 01:10.880
Okay, if you have an issue with price you need to get around people that are spending more money

01:10.880 --> 01:12.620
You need to get around people that are making more money

01:12.620 --> 01:16.160
You need to quit going with people that when they choose where they're gonna eat

01:16.480 --> 01:20.680
They're thinking of where can I get a meal for five bucks because they're broke as shit

01:20.840 --> 01:26.000
Okay, you need to go sit down with somebody that goes and they don't even look they get the appetizer

01:26.040 --> 01:29.520
They get the bottle of wine they get the frickin dessert

01:29.520 --> 01:34.280
They get they just look at what they want and now your mind is gonna start to expand like, okay

01:35.120 --> 01:39.780
Yeah, that's actually not that much thousand bucks not that much. I just spent three hundred dollars on dinner

01:40.280 --> 01:42.280
Okay thousand bucks is nothing

01:42.680 --> 01:47.680
That's how you overcome it. So my challenge to you guys this and then we're gonna jump into QA is

01:48.480 --> 01:53.360
Whatever first of all, if you don't know what that objection is for you, you're not making enough offers

01:53.360 --> 01:54.400
You need to do that first

01:54.400 --> 01:59.720
But if you do know the objection if you want to overcome that and quit getting that you need to fundamentally

02:00.320 --> 02:02.040
overcome this in your head and

02:02.040 --> 02:08.500
The way that you do that is by doing the thing that you keep facing by signing the contract

02:08.760 --> 02:11.520
Okay by making the decision same day

02:12.000 --> 02:16.680
By doing it without your wife or your husband or your partner

02:16.680 --> 02:17.080
Okay

02:17.080 --> 02:25.400
Now again strategically by not worrying about buying something because it's too expensive because you know what money's money and I'm gonna make it back

02:25.560 --> 02:27.560
Okay, that's how you overcome it
