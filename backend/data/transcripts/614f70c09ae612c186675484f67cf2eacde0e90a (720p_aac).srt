1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,880
Sam says, could you do automated check-ins?

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:03,600
Absolutely.

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,400
Absolutely could do automated check-ins.

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,400
I do think the phone call goes a long way,

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,720
like just checking in with them.

6
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,880
I think if you want to do an automated check-in,

7
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,960
maybe like half the time, and maybe half the time

8
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,280
you do a call, maybe you have it set up.

9
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,880
The second and the fourth week, it's an email.

10
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,000
And it's like, hey, whatever, whatever.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,440
The second week is this email, it's already scripted out.

12
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,720
This one's this email, and maybe every month it changes.

13
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:28,840
Totally.

14
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,720
I think the other two weeks though, you need to call them.

15
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,920
I think at least specifically for this first

16
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,960
three to six month contract, you need to call them

17
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,440
and you need to let them know that you care,

18
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,320
that you're paying attention, that you're focused on them.

19
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,120
Now, after that first contract's done

20
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,520
and you've signed the new one, that's when you can go,

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,520
okay, what parts of this can we automate?

22
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,880
That's where they're so much easier to work with.

23
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,720
Like, dude, the only time I even talk to my clients,

24
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,000
let me give you an example, my artificial grass client,

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,400
I've had him since 2021, okay, like the first of 2021.

26
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,680
So I guess we're coming up on two years.

27
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,000
I don't talk to this guy, like we just keep doing business.

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,920
Now, I talked to him today.

29
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,080
Well, he didn't answer.

30
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,520
I called him today, but it wasn't to talk about business,

31
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,680
it was because I needed a quote on a townhome

32
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,520
that I just bought.

33
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,240
And I had his little patch of grass and it looks like shit.

34
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,120
I'm like, hey, let me get my guy to give me a quote.

35
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,000
So they just become so much easier.

36
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,320
Once you gain that trust, Sam, or anyone else asking,

37
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,040
once you gain that trust during that first

38
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,040
three to six month period, things ease up,

39
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,760
but take your time, be okay doing things.

40
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,360
I heard this once, I loved it.

41
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,080
Be okay doing things that are unscalable

42
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,080
because sometimes the unscalable things

43
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,360
are the things that allow you to scale.

44
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,240
I know that sounds kind of weird.

45
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,560
Let me say that one more time.

46
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,600
Be okay doing the unscalable things

47
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,560
because sometimes those unscalable things

48
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,840
are the very things that allow you to scale.

49
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,520
What I mean by that is it's not scalable

50
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,800
to checking every one of your clients every Friday.

51
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,640
I get it, okay?

52
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:05,760
However, sometimes those things that aren't scalable,

53
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,240
they show the business owner, hey,

54
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,000
I know this isn't scalable.

55
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,480
He can't possibly do this to everyone.

56
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,640
And that's the reason why it's so effective.

57
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,920
So I would tell you during those first three to six months,

58
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,400
that first contract, be okay making a phone call.

59
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,240
And in the back of your mind, okay,

60
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,720
let's set up some automation so that once he or she

61
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,840
signs that second contract, boom,

62
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,680
it's just an automated system, okay?

63
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,520
Great question.
