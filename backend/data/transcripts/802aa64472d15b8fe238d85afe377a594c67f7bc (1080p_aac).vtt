Okay, Chris vise does Google still manager manage a campaigns clicks to ensure the budget is spent by the end. I think he's saying does Google still manage a campaigns clicks to ensure the budget is spent by the end of the 30 days, which I know I think

00:21.000 --> 00:27.000
because there's been times in mind where like I've set the budget for 20 bucks a day and it doesn't spend 600 in a month.

00:27.000 --> 00:42.000
Yeah, yeah. And then I've had some that, like, I set at a thing and all sudden it's, they get a thing like hey you're, you're ad didn't land on certain days because you ran out of budget, and you're like oh okay so it goes both ways so no they don't.

00:42.000 --> 00:51.000
It's not I wouldn't word it that way. It's just, it's what you set up to spend the day, and then they'll, they'll do their best to spend your money but it doesn't guarantee that it's going to spend it every day.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
Yeah, they would love to spend the money that you're

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
spending. Yeah, yeah.
