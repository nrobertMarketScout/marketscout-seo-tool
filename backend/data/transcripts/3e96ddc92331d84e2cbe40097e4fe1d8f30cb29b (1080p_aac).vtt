00:00.000 --> 00:11.480
Now that we have expanded our keyword list, I'm going to give you a list of rules that

00:11.480 --> 00:14.240
we follow when we are writing content.

00:14.240 --> 00:19.280
Whether you're going to outsource the content to someone or you're writing it yourself,

00:19.280 --> 00:24.540
we still follow these rules and they're very basic rules that we follow by.

00:24.540 --> 00:29.520
One piece of advice is I would actually, if this is the first website that you're starting

00:29.520 --> 00:32.560
on, I would actually write the content myself.

00:32.560 --> 00:37.680
I know it's a pain, but by doing so, you know exactly what you're going to outsource and

00:37.680 --> 00:43.720
it's always better to know what you're doing before you give that word to someone else

00:43.720 --> 00:48.160
because that way you can set expectations and you know what you want back.

00:48.160 --> 00:54.040
So here's starting, let's start, I'm going to write a paragraph.

00:54.040 --> 00:55.400
So again, we use Basecamp.

00:55.400 --> 00:56.400
All right.

00:56.400 --> 00:57.400
So I created a new doc.

00:57.480 --> 01:02.320
I'm actually going to, I usually keep them separate for each page.

01:02.320 --> 01:08.600
So we're going to talk about this later, but each page, I would probably keep it a separate

01:08.600 --> 01:09.600
doc.

01:09.600 --> 01:10.960
I'm talking about the content.

01:10.960 --> 01:16.520
So homepage, content, name it whatever you want.

01:16.520 --> 01:17.520
Okay.

01:17.520 --> 01:21.520
And let's just start with a little paragraph so you can kind of get an idea.

01:21.520 --> 01:29.000
So number one rule is the first word of your paragraph, especially on the homepage, especially

01:29.000 --> 01:34.880
the very top paragraph, the one that we put that little corner image, you want it to be

01:34.880 --> 01:36.200
a keyword.

01:36.200 --> 01:42.480
So if you're, if your website is Queen concrete or whatever it is, you probably want to be

01:42.720 --> 01:53.720
saying something like Queen Creek concrete.

01:53.720 --> 01:57.880
Or you can even, cause you always, so one of the rules is you actually want to sound

01:57.880 --> 02:00.760
like you own the company.

02:00.760 --> 02:06.520
So you don't want to sound like a third person or a third party or just in a weird way, you

02:06.520 --> 02:09.360
always want to sound like you are the owner of the company.

02:09.360 --> 02:17.720
So you can say something like here at Queen Creek concrete and remember that your company

02:17.720 --> 02:21.240
name is going to be the location and the service.

02:21.240 --> 02:22.760
Keep it simple.

02:22.760 --> 02:24.940
So in my case, it's Queen Creek concrete.

02:24.940 --> 02:29.360
If it was in Las Vegas concrete, I would just say here at Las Vegas concrete and keep that

02:29.360 --> 02:33.360
consistent because if you change the name within the content, you're going to sound

02:33.360 --> 02:34.360
unprofessional.

02:34.360 --> 02:39.680
So you want to keep it consistent and keep the name of the company that you have assigned

02:39.680 --> 02:43.440
yourself the same as in the header, the same as in the content everywhere, the same as

02:43.440 --> 02:46.640
in the, in the GMB everywhere.

02:46.640 --> 02:49.040
You are called Queen Creek concrete.

02:49.040 --> 02:50.120
Just keep it consistent.

02:50.120 --> 02:54.280
Do not have 10 names because an actual company would have one name only.

02:54.280 --> 02:55.280
Okay.

02:55.280 --> 03:00.960
So here we go here at Queen Creek concrete, we, and again, talk as if you were part of

03:00.960 --> 03:19.240
the company, we at, we offer service, we offer all types of residential and commercial concrete

03:19.240 --> 03:36.080
services and then whether, whether you are looking for concrete driveway or concrete

03:36.080 --> 03:40.840
patio, we have got you covered.

03:40.840 --> 03:41.840
Okay.

03:41.840 --> 03:47.840
I'm going to pause and kind of read you some of the rules that we have.

03:47.840 --> 03:51.400
So number one, again, start with a keyword.

03:51.400 --> 03:52.400
Okay.

03:52.400 --> 03:57.800
Queen, Queen Creek concrete is a keyword because we have the location and the service.

03:57.800 --> 04:03.960
Another one would be to create a bullet list and I would keep it one bullet list or a number

04:03.960 --> 04:09.720
list, whatever list you want to do per 1000 words.

04:09.720 --> 04:14.560
And what that is, is you don't want to start with a bullet list that looks a little silly.

04:14.560 --> 04:21.560
So after you've read a couple of sentences, you can put something like here are some,

04:21.560 --> 04:23.840
we'll keep a space in between.

04:23.840 --> 04:25.440
Okay.

04:25.440 --> 04:42.520
Here are some of the top services that our local contract, contract tours cover.

04:42.520 --> 04:43.760
And here's where we do the bullet list.

04:43.800 --> 04:51.800
The reason why we do a bullet list is because it's a very easy way to add keywords.

04:51.800 --> 04:52.800
Okay.

04:52.800 --> 05:07.480
We can put concrete driveway, stand concrete, concrete patio, concrete, I don't know, decorative

05:07.480 --> 05:13.480
concrete, whatever it is, whatever your company you really want to rank for.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.720
And you can, you can make it longer.

05:15.720 --> 05:22.240
Of course, don't make like a two, two little items or a thousand, like keep it smooth and

05:22.240 --> 05:23.240
professional.

05:23.240 --> 05:28.120
Another, another easy way to get some ideas on what content to write.

05:28.120 --> 05:33.400
You can actually get on Google and if you type concrete driveway near me, which is what

05:33.400 --> 05:36.800
we're trying to go after.

05:36.800 --> 05:39.240
And I'm sure you guys have seen this before.

05:39.240 --> 05:45.560
If you go down here where it says people ask for, Google will give you an idea of what

05:45.560 --> 05:48.120
people are looking for and their writing.

05:48.120 --> 05:53.280
So you can even write these rhetorical questions within your content.

05:53.280 --> 05:55.560
That's a very easy way you can.

05:55.560 --> 06:00.800
So this one would be a great question because you can, and this is a really easy way to

06:00.800 --> 06:04.640
get ideas on what content you're going to write about this subject.

06:04.640 --> 06:05.640
Okay.

06:05.640 --> 06:06.640
This is a great question.

06:07.240 --> 06:09.120
What is stamped concrete driveway?

06:09.120 --> 06:10.120
Okay.

06:10.120 --> 06:13.120
So you can put that in here.

06:13.120 --> 06:17.320
And again, we'll rearrange the content to run smooth.

06:17.320 --> 06:25.440
What is stamped concrete driveway?

06:25.440 --> 06:31.240
This could be one of our titles in the content and then you go and answer and say, stamped

06:31.240 --> 06:52.840
concrete driveway is a great way to personalize and get the exact look that you have been

06:52.840 --> 06:55.840
looking for in a driveway.

07:01.840 --> 07:05.840
What is stamped concrete?

07:05.840 --> 07:24.840
Our professional constructors will be able to give your concrete any texture.

07:24.840 --> 07:26.840
I think they can do color too.

07:27.440 --> 07:38.440
You want, I think, a type of the card of color, different pattern, textures, and color.

07:38.440 --> 07:39.440
Okay.

07:39.440 --> 07:41.440
We can add pattern as well.

07:41.440 --> 07:46.440
Texture, pattern, and color.

07:46.440 --> 07:51.760
So they can make concrete look like stone, but they can make concrete, you know, have

07:51.760 --> 07:52.760
any type of pattern.

07:52.760 --> 07:54.040
And that's really cool.

07:54.040 --> 07:58.040
So that's a great way to add some content right there.

07:58.040 --> 08:00.040
And this is a great tool.

08:00.040 --> 08:05.040
And the more you actually expand these questions, the more questions come up.

08:05.040 --> 08:08.040
So this is a very, very good idea.

08:08.040 --> 08:13.040
One rule that we also usually follow is try to avoid the word cheap.

08:13.040 --> 08:15.040
So we don't really put cheap concrete service.

08:15.040 --> 08:17.040
That sounds like it's not really good quality.

08:17.040 --> 08:20.040
So instead of using words like cheap, we use affordable.

08:20.040 --> 08:22.040
Just be smart about the words that you're using.

08:22.040 --> 08:27.040
Don't make it sound like you're Walmart, but make it sound like your actual professional

08:27.040 --> 08:28.040
local company.

08:28.040 --> 08:37.040
So then we have do not use more than 10 of the same keywords per thousand words.

08:37.040 --> 08:39.040
That's why we expanded the keyword list.

08:39.040 --> 08:44.040
So do not use the same 10 keywords per thousand words.

08:44.040 --> 08:47.040
And that includes the location as well.

08:47.040 --> 08:52.040
So not just concrete patio, but also don't keep saying here in New York, here in New

08:52.040 --> 08:54.040
York, here in New York, or here in Queen Creek.

08:54.040 --> 09:00.040
Do not keep repeating that more than 10 times per thousand words.

09:00.040 --> 09:06.040
And I'm actually going to show you some resources and tools that you can use to track that down.

09:06.040 --> 09:10.040
And then use both short tail and long tail keywords.

09:10.040 --> 09:15.040
So make sure you are using something very short like concrete patio as a keyword, but

09:15.040 --> 09:25.040
also you're also using something more lengthy like concrete driveway repair here in Queen

09:25.040 --> 09:26.040
Creek, Arizona.

09:26.040 --> 09:28.040
That would be a long tail.

09:28.040 --> 09:30.040
They're both important.

09:30.040 --> 09:35.040
Make sure after you're done writing your content, if you're writing the content yourself, you

09:35.040 --> 09:41.040
probably know whether you plagiarize the content or you've wrote it yourself.

09:41.040 --> 09:48.040
If you are outsourcing, make sure that you're checking the plagiarism and you're not copying

09:48.040 --> 09:50.040
and pasting content from anywhere else.

09:50.040 --> 09:52.040
This will really penalize you.

09:52.040 --> 09:59.040
And you want to keep the plagiarism percentage below four percent.

09:59.040 --> 10:04.040
Make sure, again, the company name, in my case, Queen Creek Concrete, that it's on your

10:04.040 --> 10:08.040
header is always consistent everywhere.

10:08.040 --> 10:10.040
Include the phone number in your content.

10:10.040 --> 10:15.040
So like something that I really like, I think it's very easy and a good way, a good rule of thumb

10:15.040 --> 10:21.040
would be to add the phone number once, at least once every thousand words.

10:21.040 --> 10:22.040
And that's a very easy way.

10:22.040 --> 10:26.040
You could say something like whether you're looking for a concrete driver or concrete patio,

10:26.040 --> 10:27.040
we've got you covered.

10:27.040 --> 10:48.040
And if you want to receive a free instant quote, get in touch with us by calling the following number.

10:48.040 --> 10:55.040
And here's where you're going to add the phone number that we got from CarRail.

10:55.040 --> 10:58.040
If I can find it.

10:58.040 --> 11:02.040
Anyway, I'll add it in later.

11:02.040 --> 11:07.040
I'll just put X, X, X, X, X, because I know that will mean adding the phone number.

11:07.040 --> 11:11.040
OK, next rule, spell check everything.

11:11.040 --> 11:13.040
A really good tool to have.

11:13.040 --> 11:15.040
It's actually Grammarly.

11:15.040 --> 11:21.040
So Grammarly, I'm pretty sure you have to pay for it.

11:21.040 --> 11:26.040
There may be free tryout, but this is what it is.

11:26.040 --> 11:32.040
You can actually add it on as an extension and it will follow you wherever you are,

11:32.040 --> 11:35.040
whatever you have Basecamp or your website builder.

11:35.040 --> 11:43.040
And not only it will spell check every word, but it will also rephrase the sentences to make them better.

11:43.040 --> 11:49.040
So that's a very easy way to spell check and actually make the sentences.

11:49.040 --> 11:52.040
And it will also correct like the punctuation.

11:52.040 --> 11:56.040
So it's a really great tool to have.

11:56.040 --> 11:59.040
And then again, write as if you were the owner.

11:59.040 --> 12:01.040
Don't make jokes.

12:01.040 --> 12:02.040
Don't try to be funny.

12:02.040 --> 12:05.040
Again, we're not writing this to be entertaining.

12:05.040 --> 12:06.040
Be simple.

12:06.040 --> 12:08.040
Keep sentences short.

12:08.040 --> 12:09.040
Keep it simple.

12:09.040 --> 12:10.040
Don't plagiarize the content.

12:10.040 --> 12:18.040
Make it like it's just a simple description of what the company does and what you do and what you offer.

12:18.040 --> 12:21.040
And keep the keyword density.

12:21.040 --> 12:23.040
What we talked about earlier.

12:23.040 --> 12:28.040
Do not use the same keyword more than 10 times per thousand word.

12:28.040 --> 12:34.040
Another way of looking at it is keep the keyword density less than five percent.

12:34.040 --> 12:37.040
And here is a really good tool for that.

12:37.040 --> 12:41.040
You can also use this to check for plagiarism.

12:41.040 --> 12:42.040
It's free.

12:42.040 --> 12:54.040
So just go on SEO review tools dot com and then you're going to add that one.

12:54.040 --> 13:05.040
Let's do keyword density checker.

13:05.040 --> 13:10.040
OK, it's super easy because you just put in so you can do the text input.

13:10.040 --> 13:14.040
You can also put the domain that you have.

13:14.040 --> 13:20.040
In my case, it would probably be text input because I haven't copied the content to my website.

13:20.040 --> 13:28.040
So I'm actually just going to do this copy and paste it in here.

13:28.040 --> 13:39.040
Perform check.

13:39.040 --> 13:52.040
OK, see, I already need to edit my content because I've said that I know that you're like, OK, well, it's 10 times the actual extension of the keyword or the short keyword.

13:52.040 --> 13:55.040
And I would say the short.

13:55.040 --> 13:57.040
So I said concrete way too much.

13:57.040 --> 14:02.040
The density right here is 19 percent and we want to keep it less than five.

14:03.040 --> 14:14.040
So go ahead and go in and add more sentences, maybe some sentences that don't have keywords just to make it less.

14:14.040 --> 14:16.040
And again, keep that less than five.

14:16.040 --> 14:24.040
And then another another tool that we use is actually the duplicate content.

14:24.040 --> 14:34.040
Cancel that part out and just type duplicate content.

14:34.040 --> 14:40.040
Oops. Maybe click right here should give you the option duplicate content checker.

14:40.040 --> 14:51.040
And that's the same thing. You can go ahead and plug in your domain at the very end if that's easier or you can text input your stuff.

14:51.040 --> 14:55.040
Perform check.

14:55.040 --> 15:01.040
And this one, you want to keep below four percent.

15:01.040 --> 15:05.040
Perfect. There is no duplicates. Of course, we just wrote that.

15:05.040 --> 15:09.040
And that is that is it for content.
