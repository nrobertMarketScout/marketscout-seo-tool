Okay. Bernie, I haven't reached the end of my initial contracts yet for my first clients.

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:11,280
Any tips to get the renewal? Yes. Super simple. I like to bump things up. I like to give them a

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,080
lot of soft touches leading up six weeks, a month up. Sometimes I'll bump the ads up a little bit

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,280
just to make sure they have a really good month. And then we have the conversation. And I make sure

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:24,960
to have the conversation about four weeks to two weeks out so that if they don't want to renew,

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,320
I have time to go find somebody else. But yeah, make sure that that last two weeks,

7
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,360
four weeks before you have the chat is a good one. Okay. And not only that you send them a

8
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,760
lot of leads, but that they're actually closing deals. You got to make sure to stay in touch with

9
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:45,280
these people. Make sure to have a lot of soft touches during that first six months. And then

10
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,480
once you re-sign into that year, dude, it becomes a lot easier. And that's the beauty is there is

11
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,000
light at the end of the tunnel.
