if nobody answers, would you leave a voicemail? And as long as it was just kind of vague,

00:05.760 --> 00:11.600
you would. Anytime I call leave or call for prospecting, I call twice. I call, hang up,

00:11.600 --> 00:16.720
call again. Because it's like, it's aggressive. It's different. It doesn't look like spam. Like

00:16.720 --> 00:22.000
most spam calls once and they're done. And then I'll leave a voicemail and I'll do a text with

00:22.080 --> 00:26.640
that same format. Hey, this is so-and-so asking about a job. Give me a call.

00:27.680 --> 00:28.160
Okay.
