1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,180
Alright, now we are doing the images for the website.

2
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:15,280
So we talked a little bit about images in our previous module.

3
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:22,040
We have said that the best practice is to ask your client for pictures.

4
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:27,040
If you do not have pictures from your clients, I am going to show you how to get some free

5
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,040
images.

6
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,080
My favorite one is actually Adobe stock images.

7
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:36,080
You are more than welcome if you know none of your clients are going to give you images

8
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:40,080
and you need to buy some.

9
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,680
It is definitely worth to get a subscription there.

10
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,400
If you only need a couple, I would do the free trial.

11
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:51,480
The free trial usually up to this day, it includes 10 images.

12
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:58,920
Because we need 25 images, you do need to create 3 accounts just to get those 25 images.

13
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,920
It can be time consuming to use the free trial.

14
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,920
That is why this is up to you if you want to pay for them or not.

15
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,920
But there is a free trial option, especially for the first site.

16
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,920
I already went ahead and made an account.

17
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,920
Right here, if you are making the free 10 photos account, I am only going to show you.

18
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:23,360
Keep in mind that you need 25 pictures, but we are only doing the header one and we will

19
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,360
do 4 more pictures underneath just to show you what the rest is going to look like.

20
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:32,360
Right here, it will tell you how many assets, so how many pictures you have left to use.

21
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:37,360
Right here, again, when we are looking for pictures, you want to make sure that you are

22
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,360
looking, especially when you are getting stock photos, that they look not stocky.

23
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,360
You want them to look like you are a local company, you actually took those photos.

24
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,800
Make sure you are familiar with what the area looks like.

25
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:54,800
Obviously, we are located in St. George, so it is very similar to Arizona.

26
00:01:54,800 --> 00:02:01,800
But I am still going to look at what homes and residential properties look in Queen Creek,

27
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:06,800
Arizona, which is the area that we are focusing on for our website.

28
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:11,800
I want to make sure that the images that I am putting on the website look like they are local.

29
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:17,840
So make sure you are going on Zello or anything like that to look at houses or whatever niche

30
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,840
you are going into.

31
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,840
So, let's start with something more broad.

32
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,840
Concrete driveway.

33
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,840
And keep in mind, you can use any other, you don't have to use Adobe Stock.

34
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:37,840
If you just go into Google and type free stock images, you will get Shutterstock, which has

35
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:42,880
some good ones, you will get iStock, Pexels, Unsplash, anything really.

36
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:47,880
So go ahead and use whatever you want as long as you follow those guidelines that we have

37
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,880
said before.

38
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:55,880
So, let's see.

39
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:12,880
The header picture is usually the hardest one because the header picture, you really

40
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:17,880
need to pick one that is looking good because it is going right here.

41
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,880
So, let's see.

42
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,880
This could be in Arizona.

43
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,880
Ok, let's go ahead and download this.

44
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,920
So, just click on license right here.

45
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:45,920
Ok, it's going to download it right here.

46
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,920
And if you really like the photo up here, it's actually going to give you some other

47
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,920
ones that are similar.

48
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,920
This could be in Arizona too.

49
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:01,920
It's not a great driveway, but it may work.

50
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:10,960
Ok, I think this one is pretty, could be, this looks pretty general.

51
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,960
We have three.

52
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:20,960
I don't know if I like any of those to be my header photo, so I would like my header

53
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:21,960
photo.

54
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:26,960
And your header photo could even be a picture of Queen Creek, like a city or a neighborhood.

55
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,960
Let's see, maybe if we type Queen Creek, Arizona.

56
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Let's see if they have any good ones.

57
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Alright.

58
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Ok, maybe Arizona.

59
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Get creative with how you're searching.

60
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Like for example, if you're going into, I don't know, Alabama and you know that in your

61
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
city that you're going after, there's a lot of brick homes, you can actually just search

62
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
brick home.

63
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
If you know the exact type of house that you're looking for, you can just type that.

64
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,040
This actually looks perfect.

65
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,040
I'm pretty sure there's a stamped concrete.

66
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:12,040
So, that would actually work.

67
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:19,040
Let's see, this one would be a good one.

68
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,040
Ok, we already have four.

69
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,040
I think that's stamped concrete.

70
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,040
Um.

71
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:46,040
But because I'm not sure, just do a quick stamped concrete driveway.

72
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:52,080
This is when you want to be careful.

73
00:05:52,080 --> 00:06:01,080
Make sure that what you're putting up is exactly what you're looking for.

74
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,080
Ok, yeah, I think that's stamped concrete.

75
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:13,080
Ok, this would be a really good header photo.

76
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,120
Ok, let's download and we should have all the images that we need.

77
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,120
Ok, let's go back to our website.

78
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,120
There's the header photo right here.

79
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,120
Now we need to optimize the images.

80
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,120
So we need to make them SEO friendly because even images are important when it comes to

81
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,120
ranking, when it comes to optimizing your website to be Google friendly.

82
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,120
So one thing that we want to do is when it comes to optimization of your images, there's

83
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,120
two very important things.

84
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,160
One is resizing the images.

85
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,160
The other one is renaming the images.

86
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,160
See how right now they're called Adobe stock?

87
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:52,160
Well, nobody that is Googling for your website will see that that photo is called Adobe stock.

88
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,160
Google will and they don't usually like that.

89
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:59,160
So they want to know exactly what that photo is instead of being an Adobe photo.

90
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,160
And so we're going to rename them.

91
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:07,160
Now let's, we resize every picture except for the header one.

92
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:11,200
Usually the header one we don't need to resize because the header picture needs to be at

93
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:15,200
least 1200 pixels to even look not blurry.

94
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:20,200
So let's Google a free image resizer.

95
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,200
And again, there are so many options out there.

96
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,200
Just pick one that works for you.

97
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,200
I've used this one before.

98
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,200
A simple image resizer.

99
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,240
So select image.

100
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,240
Download.

101
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,240
Okay.

102
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,240
Let's resize this one.

103
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,240
Usually I want to do it by dimension.

104
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,240
And I would keep them under a thousand pixels.

105
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:02,280
But usually I like it to do between like 300 and 400.

106
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,280
Let's see, 450.

107
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,280
Okay, that looks silly.

108
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,280
So maybe let's try the percentage because this is not a square picture.

109
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:28,320
It's hard to make it look natural.

110
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,320
So maybe let's do 30% smaller.

111
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,320
Oops.

112
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,320
We need to select it again.

113
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,320
This one right here.

114
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,360
Okay.

115
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,360
Okay, but we don't really know how many pixels that is.

116
00:08:53,360 --> 00:09:02,360
So let's try different free image resizer.

117
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,360
Okay, let's try this one.

118
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,360
Drop it there.

119
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,360
This should work better because he tells you exactly this is way too much.

120
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,360
So let's make it.

121
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,360
Okay.

122
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:28,360
And he already tells you this is perfect because you want to keep it max 400

123
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,360
and he already automatically picks a hyphen.

124
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,400
That won't make it look funky.

125
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,400
Let's download the image.

126
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,400
Perfect.

127
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,400
Now I like to open the image immediately.

128
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,400
Now let's go ahead and change the name.

129
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,400
So click here.

130
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,400
And the name of the image really just can be a keyword.

131
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:53,400
So have your keyword list on hand, whatever you're doing on page SEO

132
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,400
because you're really going to use the keyword list.

133
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,440
So have your keyword list on hand, whatever you're doing on page SEO

134
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,440
because you're really going to use it.

135
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,440
And it's really easy when you have an image pulled up

136
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,440
because all you need to do is look at what the image is and describe it.

137
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,440
So this is a concrete driveway and that is going to be the name of the image.

138
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,440
You can even put the location that you're trying to target.

139
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,440
So Queen Creek.

140
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,440
And I'm going to save this on my desktop.

141
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,440
You can say whatever you want.

142
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,480
Just make sure you know what it is when you need to add it to your website.

143
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,480
Perfect.

144
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,480
Now let's go back

145
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,480
to our images.

146
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,480
Let's do the next one.

147
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,480
OK, 400.

148
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,480
OK, I'm going to name this.

149
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,480
Because the driveway does not look like it's concrete,

150
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,480
but the sidewalk does.

151
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,480
So I'm going to name this concrete sidewalk.

152
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,480
Perfect.

153
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,480
Let's do

154
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,480
let's do another one.

155
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,480
I should do this one.

156
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,480
OK, this could be the concrete walkway.

157
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,480
It looks like it's stamped concrete.

158
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,480
We can even put the cord of concrete.

159
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,520
Image.

160
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:52,520
Rename it and do not use the same names or the same images.

161
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,520
Always be creative and use a different name for each image.

162
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:59,520
So, um, the cord of

163
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,520
concrete.

164
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,520
OK, let's do the next one.

165
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,560
Concrete.

166
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,560
Perfect.

167
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,560
And

168
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,560
so far we have three.

169
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,560
OK, we need another small image,

170
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,560
which I believe is this one.

171
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:29,560
And then we're going to work with our header photo.

172
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,560
Oops.

173
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,560
OK, right here.

174
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,560
OK, let's see.

175
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,560
OK, this one.

176
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,560
And let's do the same thing.

177
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,560
So for 100,

178
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,560
you can even do 300 if you want to be extra safe.

179
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,560
The reason why we make them smaller

180
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,560
is because

181
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,560
if you have very large images, they look very nice,

182
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,560
but the website takes a longer time to load.

183
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,560
And these people are calling themselves

184
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,600
a contractor.

185
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,600
They want things done.

186
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,600
So if if you

187
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,600
I mean, think about the times that you have searched something

188
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,600
on the Internet and the website was really, really slow to load.

189
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,600
You have probably clicked out of it and clicked a different one.

190
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,600
So that's the reason why we want to optimize things

191
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,600
to make the website load fast.

192
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,600
OK, and we can actually name this stamp to concrete.

193
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,600
So let's download

194
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,640
so let's download

195
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,640
rename

196
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,640
stamped concrete.

197
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,640
Make sure you're spelling everything correctly

198
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,640
and don't leave spacers, by the way, when you're renaming.

199
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,640
So how I have a space right here, that won't be good.

200
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,640
So have everything put together.

201
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:06,680
OK, and now, lastly, we're going to worry about our header photo.

202
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,680
So let's click out of here, select image.

203
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,680
Make sure it's this one.

204
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,680
Awesome.

205
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,680
So it's four point three.

206
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,680
It's a little big.

207
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,680
So I would probably do two thousand.

208
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,680
That should be better.

209
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,680
You can also crop it, but you can do that in Weebly as well.

210
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,680
So let's try it.

211
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,680
If it doesn't work exactly how we want it,

212
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,720
we can always go back here and edit it.

213
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,720
And how I like to name the header photo is usually the company's name,

214
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:42,720
not the client name, but our company that we have created with this website.

215
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:49,720
So in my case, that would be Queen Creek Concrete.

216
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,720
OK, I'm going to save this on my desktop where I have all my other ones.

217
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,720
OK, now back to Weebly.

218
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,720
So we have optimized images.

219
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,760
We have resized, renamed.

220
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,760
OK, let's go back to Weebly.

221
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,760
Right here, let's do the header first.

222
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,760
See how that looks.

223
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,760
So you're going to click on replace header layout.

224
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,760
Oops, just kidding.

225
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,760
You're going to click on edit background.

226
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,760
Click out of color, click on image and replace.

227
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,760
OK, upload image, upload a photo from your computer.

228
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,760
OK, right here is our header image.

229
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,800
Let's click on open.

230
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,800
OK, that looks good.

231
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,800
So you can actually, if you hold on to the mouse, you can actually move this around.

232
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:42,800
I know the house is really nice, but you also want to make sure that people can see the driveway.

233
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,800
So let's keep it that.

234
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,800
Click save usually gets a little bigger.

235
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,800
Perfect.

236
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:52,800
So you can, if you click here, this little dot, you can make it larger.

237
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,840
OK, that should work.

238
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,840
I think there's a space here.

239
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,840
There's not.

240
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,840
OK, let's go ahead and add our phone number here.

241
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:04,840
What we like to do, if you have a very colorful image, sometimes it's hard to read.

242
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,840
So we like to do something.

243
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:10,840
Whatever we have done right here with the color block, we put in the header.

244
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:18,840
So go ahead and add that up here and let's drag the title in here and the phone number.

245
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,880
OK, let's actually add the company's phone number.

246
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,880
So go ahead and copy that.

247
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:30,880
Either go on call real, make sure that everything is very detail oriented.

248
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:35,880
So make sure the phone number double, triple check that it's the exact one that you want

249
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:36,880
it to be.

250
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:42,880
Make sure that it's linked to a click to call to the same phone number so people can actually

251
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,880
click and call.

252
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,880
Let's make this smaller.

253
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,920
A little bigger.

254
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,920
All right.

255
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,920
We don't need the color block to be that big.

256
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:54,920
And Weebly doesn't allow you to make things skinnier.

257
00:16:54,920 --> 00:17:02,920
So a trick to doing by doing that is to put a spacer outside the color block and see how

258
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:07,920
now you can make it more skinny to fit in there.

259
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:12,920
So put it outside of the color block and you can actually fix it to fit in there.

260
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:21,960
And then we can make the color block less of a block by clicking on it under background

261
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,960
transparency.

262
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:28,960
You can make this less so you can actually still see through the picture behind it.

263
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,960
But it's you can see the letters more and you can make the color block like you can

264
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,960
round the corners.

265
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,960
This is up to you.

266
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,960
I like to round them a little bit so it's not so harsh, but you can do whatever you

267
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,960
want.

268
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
And then I usually like to put a divider in between so I have a nice line.

269
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,000
OK, let's make see what this looks like on the mobile.

270
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
OK, I don't love I usually like everything to be in a line.

271
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
So just switch things up.

272
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
If you see this, just go into the theme, change the fonts to make something that looks

273
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
better and more aligned.

274
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:15,040
OK, and now you can also I'm pretty sure if we put a spacer above, it should screen.

275
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,040
No, that won't work that way.

276
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,040
So let's get rid of that.

277
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,040
OK, let's see.

278
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:25,040
Let's make this a different color.

279
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,040
OK, that looks better.

280
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,080
OK, that looks better.

281
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:38,080
And then let's change this to be.

282
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:51,080
OK, let's change the and now that we know what the header looks like, it's easier to

283
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,080
make a form for it.

284
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:59,080
So we can even do you can round the corners of the form as well.

285
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,120
OK.

286
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:09,120
Let's do let's just see what a yellow would look like.

287
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,120
Don't really like that yellow.

288
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,120
So let's grab.

289
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,120
Maybe we just need to do a gray.

290
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,120
OK, now that it's really hard to see the font.

291
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,160
This is a little annoying.

292
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,160
Whenever you're going with a dark color in the form, you just have to click on theme,

293
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,160
click on fonts and then paragraph text.

294
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:39,160
You're going to have to make that white and then it's going to be invisible here.

295
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,160
So you have to manually make that black.

296
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,160
But that's OK.

297
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,160
I don't love.

298
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,160
That.

299
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,160
Don't love you, neither of them.

300
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,200
OK, we want to make this white.

301
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,200
You can actually see it.

302
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,200
You probably want to make this yellow.

303
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,200
Like the phone number.

304
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:10,200
And obviously, this is not I mean, there's no rule in this.

305
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,200
It's whatever you think looks decent.

306
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,200
I would probably go with it.

307
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,240
There.

308
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,240
You can also make the form like a little smaller.

309
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,240
I feel like that looks better.

310
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,240
OK, now let's highlight every piece of content.

311
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:29,240
Make sure and this is can be annoying.

312
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,240
But it's important that you are paying attention to the font.

313
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,240
You can also make the font smaller.

314
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,240
I feel like that looks better.

315
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,240
OK, now let's highlight every piece of content.

316
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,240
Make sure and this is can be annoying.

317
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,280
But it's important that you are paying attention to.

318
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,280
This is already black.

319
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,280
OK, so the rest of the content is good to go.

320
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,280
Now, let's add the corner image right here.

321
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,280
So just click on here.

322
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:58,280
Upload a photo from your computer and.

323
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,280
Let's do this one.

324
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:09,280
I don't know if you remember when we were putting this into the desktop

325
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,280
into the mobile phone.

326
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:15,320
Look, this content would actually be disappearing.

327
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:21,320
So well, when you add an image, as I said, in the module in the second

328
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,320
module, this comes back.

329
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:29,320
So OK, go back to desktop and you're going to do the same down here

330
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,320
with the other three images that we downloaded.

331
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,360
So one.

332
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,360
Two.

333
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,360
Three.

334
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,360
All right, make sure the pictures are looking good.

335
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,360
One thing that I like to do, and this is totally up to you, just giving

336
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,360
you ideas where the pictures are.

337
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,360
You can put it like a dark gray.

338
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,360
You can match the same dark gray as the quote form.

339
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05,360
And then one last thing you need to do to optimize your images

340
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,360
to be SEO friendly is click on the image right here.

341
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:13,360
Go all the way to advanced and make sure you have an alt text.

342
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,360
An alt text is pretty much another description of what the image is.

343
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,360
So I'm pretty sure if you are.

344
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,360
Like have some kind of disability and you can't see the image,

345
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,360
there is a way that you can see the description of the image.

346
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,360
And that's what the alt text is also used for is for people to identify

347
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,400
whatever is on the image.

348
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,400
So just be descriptive about it.

349
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,400
For example, this could be stamped.

350
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,400
Concrete for house.

351
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,400
Walkway.

352
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,400
And you're going to do this for these three images

353
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,400
and all the other images as well.

354
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,400
And then make sure you're always publishing after you're done.

355
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,440
And that's all you have to do.

356
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:04,440
So do that for all 25 images and you're good to go.
