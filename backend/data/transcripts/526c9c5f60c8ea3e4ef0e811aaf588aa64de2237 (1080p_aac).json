What I would be doing is if I have a couple ads live, I would be thinking like okay, and I'm gonna let you answer your own question but if I had if I was in that case, and let's say that like they're just not getting clicks and leads are coming in whatever right. I would be thinking, let's assume that once these start popping off, I'm going to have to, you know, I'm going to have to replace them right like what let's say I sell these two, these two deals that I'm that I'm running ads for. What would then be your next steps. Okay. You probably have to go and find more niches and cities and get those landing pages ready, and the ads ready. So what I would be doing if you're waiting it's like, have the next three or four in the pipe. Okay, that's what I'd be doing. Okay. But for those of you that are in that situation I like to have if one of them you got one going, and there's nothing coming in, you're cool setting up another one and then once one of them starts to go pause the one focus on it So that's what that's what I would personally do camera is like have the next few ready to go.", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 9.0, "text": " Cameron, you mentioned you know the effective task when you have a couple ads going waiting for leads to come in to transfer what else can you be doing great question.", "tokens": [50364, 24962, 11, 291, 2835, 291, 458, 264, 4942, 5633, 562, 291, 362, 257, 1916, 10342, 516, 3806, 337, 6689, 281, 808, 294, 281, 5003, 437, 1646, 393, 291, 312, 884, 869, 1168, 13, 50814], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.14579626657430408, "compression_ratio": 1.7520325203252032, "no_speech_prob": 0.004200385417789221}, {"id": 1, "seek": 0, "start": 9.0, "end": 21.0, "text": " What I would be doing is if I have a couple ads live, I would be thinking like okay, and I'm gonna let you answer your own question but if I had if I was in that case, and let's say that like they're just not getting clicks and leads are coming in", "tokens": [50814, 708, 286, 576, 312, 884, 307, 498, 286, 362, 257, 1916, 10342, 1621, 11, 286, 576, 312, 1953, 411, 1392, 11, 293, 286, 478, 799, 718, 291, 1867, 428, 1065, 1168, 457, 498, 286, 632, 498, 286, 390, 294, 300, 1389, 11, 293, 718, 311, 584, 300, 411, 436, 434, 445, 406, 1242, 18521, 293, 6689, 366, 1348, 294, 51414], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.14579626657430408, "compression_ratio": 1.7520325203252032, "no_speech_prob": 0.004200385417789221}, {"id": 2, "seek": 0, "start": 21.0, "end": 22.0, "text": " whatever right.", "tokens": [51414, 2035, 558, 13, 51464], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.14579626657430408, "compression_ratio": 1.7520325203252032, "no_speech_prob": 0.004200385417789221}, {"id": 3, "seek": 2200, "start": 23.0, "end": 37.0, "text": " I would be thinking, let's assume that once these start popping off, I'm going to have to, you know, I'm going to have to replace them right like what let's say I sell these two, these two deals that I'm that I'm running ads for.", "tokens": [50414, 286, 576, 312, 1953, 11, 718, 311, 6552, 300, 1564, 613, 722, 18374, 766, 11, 286, 478, 516, 281, 362, 281, 11, 291, 458, 11, 286, 478, 516, 281, 362, 281, 7406, 552, 558, 411, 437, 718, 311, 584, 286, 3607, 613, 732, 11, 613, 732, 11215, 300, 286, 478, 300, 286, 478, 2614, 10342, 337, 13, 51114], "temperature": 0.0, "avg_logprob": -0.07176724525347147, "compression_ratio": 1.6325301204819278, "no_speech_prob": 0.08137962222099304}, {"id": 4, "seek": 2200, "start": 37.0, "end": 40.0, "text": " What would then be your next steps.
