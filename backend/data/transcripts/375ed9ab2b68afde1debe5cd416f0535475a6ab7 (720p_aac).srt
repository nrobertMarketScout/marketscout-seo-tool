00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
some of you guys, maybe it's not the people that are listening right now,

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:10,960
but some of you guys are so in this mindset of like, I have these 20 sites and I got a couple

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,360
that are getting leads and I got to close one, two, three, four, five before I can go presale.

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,600
No, no, no, no. If you have a site that's getting leads and it fits the due diligence,

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,240
passes the sniff test, go sell it. And if you can't sell it, because whatever reason,

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,600
you tried a couple of times and you're just kind of stuck, set it down. That doesn't mean

7
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,480
you need to go onto your next one. Cause I know some of you guys are like, well, I need to get my

8
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:37,680
hosting taken care of and all this stuff. Forget about that. Go, if you're struggling selling your

9
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:44,720
existing sites because you did crappy due diligence or whatever, pause those, do SEO,

10
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:50,000
come over here, follow my recommendations, concrete, tree service, foam and sprays from insulation,

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,520
go and sell a presale, get your momentum. Now you got momentum and you can go get another one or

12
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,520
you can come back. And I promise you guys, it's crazy when you go to sell the same person that

13
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,520
you had a problem with last time, but now you got momentum, how much easier it is to close.
