was getting a thousand impressions a day. Now I'm getting five to 10. He's the one. Do you remember

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,320
which one this was the guy who had to add suspension? What would you recommend in that?

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,440
Things are going good, getting good impressions, gets a suspension unsuspends and now he's only

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,000
getting five to 10 a day. Is that something where he needs to just go recreate it because

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,800
he's kind of got a black black X on him or is it just time of year and some other factors?

6
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:28,560
Probably other factors. Go check population, budget, CPC, go look at the edit, make sure there

7
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,240
hasn't been increases. That's probably more it than that. Typically once you're done with the

8
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:38,480
suspension you're fine. They don't really hover over it unless you're being a jerk and you continue

9
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,200
to push the buttons then they'll flag you but none of us here are trying to do that so once

10
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,240
you're through it you're good.
