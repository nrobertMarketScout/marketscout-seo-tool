1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
All righty, I think we're live, let me tell my music, sorry about that.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:25,000
All right, hey guys, let's see, we are here and live, cool, cool, hope all is well.

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
What is going on with the internet today?

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:37,000
All right, hang on a second, pain in the butt.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I think we're back in it, sorry about that.

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I am having some minor internet issues, but here we go.

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
All right, here is the Zoom, oh, that's the wrong one, let me back copy that, sorry.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Let me give you guys the Zoom link here and let's get that going there.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Let's kill that feed, okay.

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
All right, so it should be good.

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Let me know if you guys can hear me here and then let me go onto my phone and update something here.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Let's see, everyone.

13
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Go through.

14
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:52,000
All right.

15
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Yeah, it went through, cool.

16
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
All right, okay, sorry about that, guys.

17
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Okay, so I think we got the tag going.

18
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,000
There is the Zoom link if you want to hop in and let me make the setting change here.

19
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
That's already done, awesome.

20
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Okay, so.

21
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Hey.

22
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Hey, Todd, how's it going, man?

23
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Good, man, how are you?

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm doing all right.

25
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Of course, it is negative five degrees outside, so not great.

26
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Is it really?

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Yeah, yeah.

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
That sounds miserable.

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's so weird, yeah, we're in Minnesota and it's like negative five today, by Sunday it's going to be 40.

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm wearing a sweater and it's like 68 out, so I don't mean to rub it in, but I am a Southern California baby when it comes to weather, so.

31
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Yeah, yeah, I went to college in Irvine, so I get it.

32
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Okay, yeah, I'm a spoiled princess for sure, so.

33
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Yeah, all right, what's up, man, what can we help you with?

34
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Yeah, I got a couple of questions, and I don't know if I'm still going through the training, I'm not sure if this is in the training.

35
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Keyword near me.

36
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Is that a legit keyword? I know it's expensive, but what do you think?

37
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Towing, not towing, like tree service near me.

38
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So, okay, it depends on, like, in bigger cities, it's a very valuable keyword, and they charge, like, well, they're always going to charge a premium for that, and it's nothing, what's interesting about the near me is like, you and I never type that.

39
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:50,000
That is always an auto filled world by Google, so when you're typing it and you see it, you're like, yeah, near me, like, yeah, of course, like, I want to go, you know, I want to get sushi near me, yes, near me, I don't want to drive 15 miles, right?

40
00:03:50,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So it's a premium term that's like auto populated typically by Google, so they charge a premium on it because there is like a little, like a location signal, right, like an antenna from your website or your address or your Google business profile.

41
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
So they're always going to charge more for it.

42
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It's a very valuable word, so if it's in your budget to do it, what I would recommend is you running, if you're seeing a good or a decent amount of search volume for that term, I put the brackets around it to make it an exact match just for that term.

43
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:41,000
But like, let's say for tree service, like, you know, doing a tree service as a phrase match will capture near me, but it won't capture it as fast as like an exact match tree service near me, and you can have both.

44
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Okay. And typically, you'll see a big difference between the two. Yeah. Is it necessary? It's not necessary. If you guys are targeting, you know, lower population cities and there's not like a crap ton of competition out there.

45
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:11,000
When there's a lot of competition, that's where that's like that. That might be where I put that differentiation in of doing something that's going to have that a little bit, a little more dialed or focused. Does that help?

46
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Yeah, yeah, no, it totally makes sense. So, so, okay, kind of having an idea, do I need it if I'm in a high competition kind of area or whatever I'm doing.

47
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:36,000
So that's the question I have to ask. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And it's not necessarily something that you have to have. It's just, it's a nice thing to have. Yeah. Can I show you, can I share my screen and show you my current deal?

48
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I should be able to, it should be open to.

49
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:49,000
How about that? You see that? Uh huh. Okay. So, this is a campaign, let's see, started just a little over a week ago.

50
00:05:49,000 --> 00:06:03,000
So we're just coming out of that learning phase. Yeah, yeah. So, hitting about only 375 and click through rate, nine clicks. I've had a couple of calls.

51
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:14,000
In fact, I was working, trying to sell, trying to rent this out to a local guy, but I lost him. He was stuck on this Google ad thing.

52
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:25,000
But as I go through here, and again, I'm pretty new with Google ads, the question I have under the ad group, I can click on ad group and then take a look at each of the terms, correct?

53
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Uh huh. So these terms are ones that Google is adding in the searches. Is that correct?

54
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So like here, let me get, actually, let me back that off. I don't understand that question. Okay.

55
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:49,000
So like, let's go to like tree removal search terms.

56
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Okay, so these are under the search terms. I'm getting impressions on them, but I didn't, I didn't put these in here.

57
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Okay, so yeah, so there's a different, okay, go back to keywords. Let me, I think I can explain this to you in a better way.

58
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You're on it though, but okay. So when we, when we say like you have an exact match and you have phrase match keywords in there, right?

59
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Yeah. Okay. So obviously exact match, like tree removal is only going to be tree removal, but like tree service with a phrase match.

60
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:35,000
So like typically any query within that area that you're throwing your ads to that has the term or phrase tree service in it is going to have the potential to throw your ad out to it.

61
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Okay. So it, so it's so the search term report, if you go back to that.

62
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
What was I on tree trimming?

63
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Actually, if you think you can actually get it on your left, cause you're just, so you're just looking at it on one word right now.

64
00:07:49,000 --> 00:08:00,000
But if you just go, that's right. But look in the left column. Now go up, go up under insights and reports, go up, up, up right there. Search terms. See that?

65
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Go down a couple right there. That will give you all of them if you don't have it. So you have a filter turned on. So turn off the keyword tree trimming.

66
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Yeah. Get rid of that. So this will show you all of the search terms your, your ad is running to. So when you set up our ads, like it's really difficult to like, when you guys like all of us learn about what are better search terms and keywords as we get better at niches and we hone down on them and we get to know them a little bit better.

67
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:37,000
But like when we don't know and we're just trying to see what's out there, we get that list of like our core keywords and we throw them out there as a phrase match. Right.

68
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:45,000
And so with that becomes a little bit of like broad match is terrible. So phrase match is better.

69
00:08:45,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And so what you, but this is part of the first week and the second week is caving into your search terms here and getting rid of ones that you don't want your ad showing to. And a lot of them will be like, like able tree service. That's probably like that's a branded search term.

70
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You already excluded it. So those are like, that's what you want to do the first week. And what that does is that helps train your ad to start getting better for that second week. And you do this again. And then by that third and fourth week is when it really starts getting better results.

71
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:37,000
And so over, over time though, let's say two, three, four months, like if you keep doing this and dialing in your ad and like you can get rid of, you can get rid of keywords. If you're like, this is just not producing or Hey, I got a bunch of like this, this and this, like three or four keyword searches.

72
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:50,000
that I'm getting a lot of impressions for, I'm going to make those an exact match and add those to my keywords. There's nothing wrong with that. Right. Okay. But it's a little beyond like the beginnings of it. This is just as you get into it and learn it.

73
00:09:50,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Okay, yeah, that makes that makes sense, I guess. And I told Nick this on Monday, I'm just kind of impatient. So, so you know, eight days in, it's like, why am I not getting 10 calls a day? You know, so

74
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:31,000
yeah, it's Google is I say this, like, they're the largest advertising company in the world. They're there to make money first. And at the same time, like, you can only imagine the billions of amounts of like, or attempts at fraud every day that they get. So like, they're all so a lot of

75
00:10:31,000 --> 00:11:01,000
times there are tweaks and adjustments could be a pain, pain in the butt to us. But they're doing it for a certain reason. So used to be able to kind of launch ads and within a couple days really get it going. And now it's like, that first week is just like, it's terrible. But it's designed so that what because what used to happen, a lot of people would do. So they would get an ad going. And as soon as it started, like, getting relevance and clicks, and this and that, people would go to the landing pages, and they would like redirect

76
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:31,000
certain like links and stuff. And so Google's now like, I'm going to make you sweat it out for a couple weeks now. Right? They want to make sure you're legit, make sure nothing's changing. So it's kind of like, like I've been saying for a while with the group and on the office offices, like, don't like, you should really reduce your expectations for the first two weeks. This is just where you manage and massage your you massage your ad to point it in the better direction to fine tune search terms

77
00:11:31,000 --> 00:12:01,000
fine tune keywords, and make sure your butt because sometimes like, even a keyword planner, you're like, okay, this is this, here's the info, I'm setting everything up, then you go to launch it. And you're like, I'm getting my butt kicked. And then you go and like, kind of reevaluate. And you're like, holy crap, like that, that cost per click is like three times as much as what I just saw two weeks ago, that's sometimes that just happens. But that's why we try to spend those first week or two like, dialing in the ad, because then by week three, four and beyond, it's it's producing way

78
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,440
better quality leads for you and your business owner.

79
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:20,040
Okay, okay, that that makes sense. One last thing, still this. So instead of going down to campaigns and ad group to look at these search terms that they're adding or testing out, this is where I should go or should I because I or should I go?

80
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:47,720
So they're not they're not adding or testing these out. These are people in that area are actually searching this into Google. And because you have tree trimming, because you have tree removal, because you have tree services, tree trimming, tree service, tree removal, like all of those are in phrase matches. And because they're in phrase matches, they're going to show up in those queries that people are actually typing in, in the area you're running ads to.

81
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:58,480
I got it. Okay. So yeah, okay. So I'll go back through those and maybe for the next week, still keep chipping away at some of these.

82
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:28,440
Yeah, and I would I would more focus like, I think you have some good words there for trees, like, I would more focus on, like, monitoring what search terms those phrases are showing up for. And part of that will be like, let's say you see a lot of like free or cheap or price or how to's or whatever, like you can add those terms into a negative keyword on your negative keyword.

83
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,840
List. So if you want, I can quickly show you how to do that.

84
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:40,160
Yeah, I think I know. So like tree removal search terms, let's say I pick one cost of tree removal, and I just add it right there.

85
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:51,280
Yeah, yes. But okay, two things on that. That is correct. But that will add that 12345 word phrase as an exact match negative keyword.

86
00:13:52,240 --> 00:14:12,560
Ah, okay. But let's say that when you're inspecting all of your search terms, you see like, not like like how much might be something but like how to free cheap cost pricing, like maybe things you don't want. You can go into if you go to the left and go down to keywords. Oh, sorry, it's right here. You're already on keywords right here. So you're already on keywords.

87
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:30,720
Here, go to the top and you'll see negative search keywords. See it? Okay, so these are ones that you've added. You see how they're bracketed. So those are exact matches, right? Yeah. Okay, but now let's let's go hit the plus sign.

88
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:54,400
Now let's add down there. Let's write. Let's just do example, you can go through this later, but add like how to because you don't want someone to be like, you don't want your ad running to someone who types, how to, how to trim my trees, or how to remove my tree, you're like, I don't want to spend my money or you're right. Okay, so do like, just type in that phrase, how to

89
00:14:54,400 --> 00:15:24,400
as a bracketed. No, just type it in. How to. Good. Now go down. You'll hit save. Okay, and then as you go up there, did it save? Yeah, right. Okay, and see how it's a broad match? Yeah. Okay, so anything that says how to, and any phrase that like has tree service, tree removal, tree trimming, whatever, related to tree service, tree removal, tree trimming, whatever, related to tree service, tree removal, tree trimming, whatever, related to tree service, tree removal,

90
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:54,400
it won't show. Same thing with the word free. Yeah. DIY. Yes. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So I don't need to do exact or phrase matching. It just well, I think that there's you got to do. I think there's a little bit of both. Like, if someone's typing in like, Kirk salsa tree service, that's a branded term, like I'll just throw it away because I don't want that competitor on there. It's an easy click and send it over. But if I'm seeing like, if I'm seeing, like,

91
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:59,960
I'm seeing, you know, and you don't have to do this, because

92
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,400
sometimes there's value in it, but it's up to you. But like,

93
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,440
you have one that's how much would it cost to remove a tree?

94
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,520
So that's a big, that's a big, exact match one, which is fine.

95
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,320
But let's say that you're like, I'm getting a lot of like, how

96
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,760
much or cost and I don't want my ads running to that. I want to

97
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,800
run that for SEO or whatever. You can just type what you just

98
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,480
did for how to you can do how much, how much you can do the

99
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,960
phrase cost, you could do free, you could do DIY, you could do

100
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,680
cheap, you can do whatever. And you could add those in the

101
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:34,280
negative keyword list. And you could be that would be a valuable

102
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:39,160
possible, that's a way to manage it. So if you go to search terms,

103
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,360
and you're like, I don't want that one, I don't want that one,

104
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,800
but oh, god, I'm seeing a lot of free or I'm seeing a lot of how

105
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,440
to or I'm seeing a lot of like, whatever Home Depot or Lowe's

106
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,440
or something, you could just type that you what I like to do

107
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,480
when I do that is I like to get it, I just, I'm kind of old. So

108
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,160
I'll just have a pad of paper next to me. And I'll just write

109
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,600
it down. And I'll just write down those like little one or

110
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,680
two word phrases. And then when I just add them, and then that

111
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,520
way, I don't have to go through every single search term and

112
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,560
decide if I want to click it. Because when I do that, it's

113
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:12,640
just an exact match. So but if I'm like, well, how to is coming

114
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,600
up a lot. So I'll just put how to and now I'm going to

115
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,400
eliminate all of the how tos that can come up in the future.

116
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,880
Oh, god. Okay. Yeah, gold, man. Thank you so much. That gives me

117
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,760
some homework to do this next week.

118
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,720
Yeah, and it's something that we go over. We've gone over a

119
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,640
bunch of office hours, still trying to get a lot of these

120
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,200
loaded into the training for you guys. And I know they're trying

121
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:39,320
to work on a 3.0. And I think it's just kind of getting the

122
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,960
videos done. But also, I think they might be moving to a

123
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,040
different platform. And there's a whole security. So we're just

124
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,760
in the background, we're trying to like, make sure that that

125
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,840
stuff's good. So it might just take a little bit longer. But a

126
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:56,040
lot of these things will come out eventually and be better able

127
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,000
for you guys to find.

128
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,480
So yeah, and I don't I don't know why the last couple of

129
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,920
times, we were trying to figure out why the volume doesn't show

130
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:11,560
I'm from Shiv's group. So I, you know, I don't when I when I go

131
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:16,480
on to my, my master account for Google, I still I'm okay, I

132
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:21,120
still see mine. But I know, you know, sometimes the the ranges

133
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,440
don't show up at all. So

134
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,920
well, I think that's last week, we were trying to figure that

135
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:31,080
out. And I haven't had a problem with it. But so

136
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,240
yeah, yeah. Okay,

137
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:38,400
it's just, I'm really liking the rare right now. Because it just

138
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,240
helps it just gets it all there. And it's really fast and easy.

139
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:46,000
So I've been pretty happy with that. I'm still trying to like,

140
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,720
you know, I'm still new to it. But I really like it. I think

141
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:54,680
for you guys, it would be it'd be a lot faster, like due

142
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,640
diligence wise for you guys, I think. And just to kind of like

143
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,760
blast these things out. And what's nice is it's all in like

144
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,960
a place where you can manage everything, which I will tell

145
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,840
you that as I've progressed in this business over the years,

146
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:13,320
like, man, having all of my stuff in one place. So nice.

147
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:18,160
Yeah, I did the I did the trial and I loved it. I just I just I

148
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,280
got to get some cash flow going in before I jump into that.

149
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:26,600
Yeah, but yeah, very cool. Yeah, I'm that that'll be the my first

150
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,360
first upgrade. So thanks, man. I gotta get to work.

151
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,720
No problem. All right. Take care. All right. Hi, Cindy. How

152
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,280
are you doing?

153
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,480
Hey, Jeff. I'm good. How are you?

154
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,800
I'm great.

155
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:41,560
That was helpful already. I've been watching a lot of your

156
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:46,120
videos. So I don't I don't have a specific question. Like, I

157
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:51,240
have the answer. But I went into like a medium competitive market.

158
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:55,960
Okay, as we had a business owner for that market, right. So my

159
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:00,960
goal is to be number two there. And when I started the ads, it

160
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,360
was great. Like the first, I don't know, three, four days, we

161
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:08,920
probably got three, four leads for this. And now it's been like

162
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:14,400
three weeks, and it's been like completely dead. So I changed a

163
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,480
couple things, like, I first I set up some ads in like the

164
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:23,720
neighboring areas that were less competitive, which is okay, like,

165
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,840
they're kind of new. So I haven't seen much from that yet.

166
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,720
And they're smaller populations.

167
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,760
So let me stop it. So you expanded your ad area out.

168
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,800
I actually set up whole new ad in another city.

169
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,560
Okay. Yeah.

170
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:44,400
Under under a different ad, whole different separate ad or

171
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,760
under the same campaign,

172
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,720
completely separate ad campaign.

173
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,080
Gotcha. Okay.

174
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:55,200
Yes. And then, and then Google got to me, because they were

175
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,040
calling trying to tell me to switch to conversions and ad had

176
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:01,000
been up for two, three weeks. And I thought, okay, maybe since

177
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,040
it's not producing, I'll give that a try. So I know, I've

178
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,440
watched a lot of your videos this weekend, never listen to

179
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,200
Google. So I need to undo this. So I did, I switched to

180
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,720
conversions on the main ad. And the next day immediately got like

181
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,800
a call. So I was like, oh, maybe this is good. The call costs a

182
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:23,560
lot of money, obviously. And they will maximize, they will

183
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:27,040
maximize the crap out of your budget when you do conversions.

184
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,960
So I guess where I need help is, can I go back like now I'm

185
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:36,280
looking at that ad and all of my search keywords are gone except

186
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:41,240
one. And it looks like it's hardly showing unless like, when

187
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,600
somebody calls, then it just charges me the full budget. I'm

188
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,640
not quite sure what happened. But should I just

189
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,880
we might be able to salvage it if you can. You can share your

190
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:55,760
screen if you want. And then we can. Sure. Yeah.

191
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:01,120
Where do I go to? Oh, I see. I see. Yeah, I see at the bottom

192
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:01,720
of the window.

193
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,200
I see open system settings.

194
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,320
Should just hit share and then yeah.

195
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,520
You can't see it yet, right?

196
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:22,840
Nope.

197
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,640
Oh, I think I had to give okay to Chrome.

198
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,560
That's okay. Yeah, there's like sometimes you even have to like

199
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:32,720
restart it and all that. So if you do just I'll be here if you

200
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,560
if you need to, it gives you a warning.

201
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,160
Yeah, it's saying quit and reopen. Yeah, that's fine. Go

202
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,800
ahead and do that. And I'll still be here. I'll wait. I'll give

203
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:50,080
you 90 seconds. Okay, thanks. All right. Okay. All right. Let's

204
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:54,920
see here. Okay, Cindy's gonna have to redo that. And we don't

205
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,480
really have anyone else on. So if anyone has any questions,

206
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,240
type them in the comments. Want to hop on zoom, hop on zoom.

207
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,200
Otherwise, let's just kind of hang out here for a minute. And

208
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:16,160
let me go through some of my DMs this week. Sorry. And see here.

209
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:48,280
All right. And oh, wow. Okay.

210
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:28,480
Sorry, someone's on. Hi, Jeff. Hi. Hey, yeah. Oh, okay. This is

211
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,000
you. I'm talking to you. So let me get me to get rid of the

212
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,040
other one. I have you twice. If this gets rid of you. I'm sorry.

213
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:40,600
Hang on. If he gets gets rid of you, come back. No, you're good.

214
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:47,320
Okay. Still here. Yes. Okay. Good deal. All right. You had two

215
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:50,800
different views up there. I'm like, wait a second. That's

216
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:54,280
okay. That's just because you restarted. It's all good. So I

217
00:24:54,280 --> 00:25:02,560
think it's working now. All right. Green share. Can you see

218
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,600
my screen now?

219
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,400
Yes.

220
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,840
Okay, so yeah, can you see that there?

221
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,400
OK, so yeah, can you see that there?

222
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,800
Yes.

223
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:39,920
So I've only got one keyword here for some reason.

224
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,600
My negative ones are there.

225
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,840
Hang on, go back to search keywords.

226
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,920
Go back to that.

227
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:50,040
OK, you have four filters turned on.

228
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:50,840
I do?

229
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,400
Yeah, so hit the three more.

230
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,720
Do you see where it's at?

231
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,760
Right there, see what you got turned on.

232
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,800
Just hit X and see if you can get rid of those.

233
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,360
No, OK.

234
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,720
OK, go to where the little martini glass is.

235
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,840
It has the number four on it.

236
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:17,280
So you have it turned on to only show concrete point.

237
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:22,200
OK, how do I turn that off?

238
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,640
You should be able to.

239
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,160
You should be able to where you're at,

240
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,120
but it's not showing you that.

241
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,080
Go ahead and click the ad group thing.

242
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,240
See what that does.

243
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,240
Here?

244
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,760
No, no, no, where it gave you that.

245
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,080
Did it let you click on anything when you click the?

246
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,440
Yeah, if you go down and click one of those, go down.

247
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,480
Down, down, right there.

248
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,640
What happens when you click that?

249
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,720
What does it do?

250
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,920
It opens up.

251
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,680
So now you want to go down and hit.

252
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,720
You should be able to remove it.

253
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,560
Remove this?

254
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,560
No.

255
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,880
You should be able to get rid of that filter.

256
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,840
So I'm trying to get.

257
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,280
OK, so you see how it has the X's,

258
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,880
or it says Lakeland concrete, phrase match,

259
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,240
like X on those little bubbles that are up?

260
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,240
Up here.

261
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:07,120
Yeah, hit X. Get rid of that filter, do the next one.

262
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,040
Get rid of that filter, do the next one,

263
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,600
get rid of that filter.

264
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,440
There's our keyword.

265
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:15,240
OK, so now you're going to go down and click on it.

266
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,920
Do the next one, get rid of that filter.

267
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,520
There's our keywords.

268
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,800
OK, so they're still there.

269
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,200
OK.

270
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:32,280
So I can just go switch this back from conversions to clicks

271
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,200
and get it going again.

272
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,440
Yeah, you just go.

273
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,160
Let's see, you're going to want to get into the settings.

274
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,160
You should be able to just go to campaigns,

275
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,300
and then go down to your search ad down there,

276
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,640
and it should be a little gear, yeah.

277
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,720
Let's see if we can do it from here.

278
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,940
If not, we'll have to go to the top, but.

279
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,800
It's right there.

280
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,080
Bidding, where it says maximize conversions.

281
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:07,840
Go down.

282
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,860
Right below $20 a day.

283
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,960
Now go ahead and change the bench strategy.

284
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,780
Flicks.

285
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:18,040
You want to set a max CPC.

286
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:18,940
If you don't know what it is,

287
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,920
just choose something for now,

288
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,520
and then you can come back and change it.

289
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,320
Is it okay to have it a bit higher

290
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,240
if it's like a little bit more?

291
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,800
I like to do a penny higher than what I see.

292
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,920
That's my normal plan.

293
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,520
Yeah, it's a penny higher than the highest.

294
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,360
The top of the pitch.

295
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,200
Okay.

296
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,720
Yeah, I'm gonna go back and check that out later.

297
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,800
Okay.

298
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,120
And then I don't know, just in general,

299
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,320
do you think like,

300
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,640
should I just focus on targeting the neighboring areas

301
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,420
that are smaller and see how that goes,

302
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:58,400
or just spend more of the budget on the main guy

303
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,480
and shoot to rank number two?

304
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,800
I don't know.

305
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:06,080
So I guess what I'm trying to understand is like,

306
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,840
you have an ad set up in your main area,

307
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,520
and then you set up, is it separate ad groups,

308
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,760
or is it like completely separate ad campaigns

309
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,600
to those other areas?

310
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,780
Completely different campaigns.

311
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:21,480
Different websites, the whole thing?

312
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:25,520
Yeah, one website that's more specific to like,

313
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:29,560
just DriveWife, and the other is general,

314
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,360
but just to a landing page,

315
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,600
because we possibly had another business owner,

316
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,480
they both wanted the same area.

317
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,960
So it was like, I'm gonna keep them separate,

318
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,320
and then just in case like the, you know,

319
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,400
BO number one doesn't want three areas,

320
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,680
and maybe they're all producing leads,

321
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,520
then I have someone else, right?

322
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,140
Yeah, you can do that.

323
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,680
Okay.

324
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:00,160
I mean, if you're running,

325
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,760
so you're running like three different ads,

326
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,840
as long as you've done the math and they're all like,

327
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:11,320
set up to optimize in those areas, you should be fine.

328
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,240
I would just try to limit any overlap.

329
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,280
That's probably the biggest thing.

330
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,920
You don't want your ads competing with themselves.

331
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,360
And I think they are.

332
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,520
So yeah, I think I need to choose,

333
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:24,360
like just focus on the bigger population,

334
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,880
slightly more competitive,

335
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,640
but that's where my business owner is,

336
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:30,320
and like that was the initial campaign,

337
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,480
and just put all of that there,

338
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,160
or scrap it all together,

339
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,560
and just go for the two on the outskirts.

340
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:39,160
So that, but maybe those are still gonna compete

341
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:43,200
with the other people advertising in the main city.

342
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,960
I get, do you wanna look at your locations?

343
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,800
Maybe we can see where you're overlapping possibly.

344
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,640
Okay.

345
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,720
So this one's Lakeland,

346
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,360
and I think I have a radius set up.

347
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,640
Unless I changed that.

348
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,480
No, I do.

349
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,080
You can still see my page, right?

350
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:22,000
Yeah, so I've got, looks like 13 miles around Lakeland.

351
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,600
Do you wanna see the actual map if I click on it?

352
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,240
Okay, so are you writing a call only ad as well?

353
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:40,080
So, no, I shut it off immediately.

354
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:40,920
Okay, no problem.

355
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,760
Yeah, okay.

356
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,160
Yeah, after you posted on, I had posted,

357
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,880
and you commented that you weren't a fan,

358
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,720
so I shut it off.

359
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:52,720
Yeah, when we were, that video is from when we were going

360
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,480
from what were smart campaigns to this expert mode,

361
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,880
and at the time, like everyone was like,

362
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,440
at the time, like everyone in the group,

363
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,960
it wasn't as many people, but at the time,

364
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,800
everyone had been trained like a really specific way,

365
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,680
and it was very, it was a lot easier.

366
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,480
And now we're jumping into like the big boy,

367
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,440
big girl territory of the expert.

368
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,560
There's no like medium area for Google ads.

369
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,080
So when we taught, it's like, hey,

370
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:22,040
like call only is the easiest one to teach people

371
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,080
because it's a lot more simple.

372
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:27,360
So yeah, I kind of wish maybe we didn't do that

373
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,560
because it creates confusion, but it is an option.

374
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,800
It does work, but it works for like immediate,

375
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:36,200
like I need help yesterday, or large areas

376
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,880
where there's not a lot of competition type of thing.

377
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,360
So, but anyhow, it's okay.

378
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,480
All right, and one of those, like when you're trying

379
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,480
to figure out what's the best way to roll something out,

380
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,480
and later you're like, it probably wasn't

381
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,280
maybe the best moment.

382
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:54,360
No, it was fine, the business owner wanted calls.

383
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,640
He's like, I don't like the forms, I want calls.

384
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,200
So I was like, okay, but.

385
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,360
Some people are weird with that.

386
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,680
I don't understand that.

387
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,120
It's like, I don't want to have money.

388
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,280
I think when I replied back to you,

389
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,640
it's just, I find that a lot of them,

390
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,160
they just like, I don't check my emails.

391
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,000
And I'm like, okay.

392
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,960
So I just sent them a text and they're like, thank you.

393
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,800
That's easy.

394
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,640
I'm like, cool.

395
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,360
Yeah, I think that's what it is.

396
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,760
By the time you get there, they're not answering the phone.

397
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,040
And I just got a call earlier.

398
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,280
Yeah, and some of them, I will say this,

399
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:31,280
over the years, I mean, sometimes there's people

400
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,560
that are just really, really busy

401
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,240
and their hands are dirty all day and they're like,

402
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,720
I'm not getting on the phone, I'm busy.

403
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,080
So sometimes that's like, okay, cool.

404
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,640
Well, who else would you trust to get this

405
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,640
and do these calls?

406
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,720
So sometimes it's their spouse.

407
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,440
Sometimes it's like, some of them might make

408
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,720
some of them more legit guys and gals may have an office

409
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,040
and they have somebody there.

410
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,600
So sometimes it's just clarifying,

411
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,760
okay, well, it's because you can't handle them right now.

412
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,960
So who can handle them?

413
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,960
And then let me point the forms to them.

414
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,320
And then that sometimes helps because

415
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:11,320
I have a couple of contractors that are clients of mine

416
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:14,560
and they don't even wanna be bothered with it.

417
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:18,960
So it goes to, one of them has an assistant that does it

418
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,640
and the other one has a sales manager.

419
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:23,000
And so I just funnel things that way

420
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,640
and it works great for their business.

421
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:27,040
And because the owner is at a place where they're like,

422
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,120
I don't even wanna deal with that.

423
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,400
I have people for that.

424
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,600
So it's more of like, okay, who do I need to point it to?

425
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,160
So, yeah.

426
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:37,120
Yeah, we've got to dig a little deeper on that

427
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,840
because like he answers the phone.

428
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:43,680
Like if it rings, he's picking up and so he's doable.

429
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:46,840
Maybe, yeah, maybe we can, someone had suggested,

430
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,880
I think it was Jason suggested maybe we can like

431
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,320
add on the service where a form comes in

432
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,160
and then we call them.

433
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:57,600
So now we give them the lead over the phone if they answer.

434
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,440
So now-

435
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,840
Yeah, you can do that.

436
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:04,840
It just becomes, it's good to do that to get a deal.

437
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:08,080
But it's something that you can like have

438
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:11,360
as an additional cost, additional service costs to people

439
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,880
because it's gonna cost you.

440
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,760
But like just think about long-term scalability of that.

441
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,880
It's not, yeah.

442
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,720
It's not.

443
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,040
It is, I mean it is, but you have to hire somebody

444
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,880
at some point to manage that.

445
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,600
Yeah, exactly.

446
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,440
I get it.

447
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,280
So, okay.

448
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,760
So, yeah, so-

449
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,800
Okay, so the areas.

450
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,280
So areas, yeah.

451
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,400
What do I show you?

452
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,280
Do you want to see like the map?

453
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,480
Well, are you running both Lakeland

454
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,320
and 13 miles around Lakeland?

455
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,440
Yes, because I think I had-

456
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,880
Are one of them turned off?

457
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,880
No, no, they're both on.

458
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,040
I think I added the radius after when it went quiet

459
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,800
because I thought I needed to expand.

460
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,800
What's the population of Lakeland?

461
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,720
Show me Lakeland on a map real quick, if you don't mind.

462
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:04,520
I'm kind of familiar with it, but I'm like-

463
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,800
I think it's 200.

464
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,240
There we go.

465
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,080
Yeah.

466
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,040
Okay, what is that to the left?

467
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:17,680
That looks like a metro area to the left there.

468
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,640
What is that?

469
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,480
Not Plant City.

470
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:22,080
What's more like towards Brandon, Bloomingdale?

471
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:22,920
What is, what's that?

472
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,600
Beyond that, it's Tampa.

473
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,920
Tampa's over there.

474
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,960
Tampa.

475
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,720
What's the distance, do directions

476
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,840
between Lakeland and Tampa?

477
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,120
How many miles is that?

478
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,040
See on the left, you can just do directions.

479
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,080
See right there?

480
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,480
Probably like 40 minutes.

481
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,920
Yeah, how do I, okay.

482
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,960
Yeah, and just do that to like Tampa.

483
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,640
I think it's like 40 minute drive.

484
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,360
Oh, I'm right on, there we go.

485
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,960
40 minutes, 35 miles, okay, cool.

486
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,960
All right, and then Winterhaven

487
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,400
is a suburb of Orlando, right?

488
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,520
And Winterhaven is very close.

489
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,160
It's like immediately to the right of Lakeland.

490
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,640
And that's actually where my business owner is.

491
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,960
Where, in Winterhaven?

492
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,800
Yeah.

493
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,360
Okay, I actually have two business owners there too.

494
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,200
It's funny.

495
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,680
Yeah, are you my competition, Jeff?

496
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,760
I'm probably competing with you.

497
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,680
No, I don't really mess with concrete, so you're good.

498
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,040
Okay, because somebody's number one

499
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,160
and I'm like, I know I'm not gonna be number one,

500
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,400
but number two is wide open, so.

501
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,320
Yeah, no, I don't really,

502
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,920
I'm not a big fan of the concrete guys, so.

503
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:39,320
Yeah, Winterhaven is, it's, where is it?

504
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,760
It's to the right a little bit more.

505
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,880
Yeah, right there.

506
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:45,240
Yeah, so you're also really close to Orlando.

507
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,600
Yes.

508
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,960
Okay, because like Disney World's like right there, right?

509
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,920
Yeah, you're up north.

510
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:55,920
Yeah, so, okay, so when you go,

511
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,520
so 13 miles outside of Lakeland

512
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,960
is picking up Winterhaven and all these up,

513
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:05,160
so you're, by blowing your ad out more

514
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,760
than just those city limits right there that we see,

515
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:11,400
you're running your ads to all of those other people

516
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,120
in that region.

517
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:15,640
So you could be at, so that will,

518
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:19,240
that, if you don't adjust your budget for that,

519
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:22,040
that's an easy way to like sabotage yourself.

520
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,160
Okay, so maybe that was my-

521
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:29,200
Yeah, yeah, so it's not that you can't run outside,

522
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,720
you just have to just make sure that you understand,

523
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:36,320
like in some areas where like Tennessee's a great example

524
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,520
of a state where like you'll have a city

525
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:41,800
of like 50, 60,000 people and that's like the big city,

526
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,880
that's the town, the grocery store, all that,

527
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:46,080
then you have this rural area around it

528
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,080
for like 10 miles, 15 miles,

529
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:51,680
and there's like a couple thousand here, five, eight, 10,

530
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,720
there's not like 100,000 population

531
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,440
somewhere next to that city.

532
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,920
That's where like that rules,

533
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,920
ruralness works for you to do that.

534
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,280
But in areas like Florida, California, New York,

535
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:07,160
except unless you're like way upstate New York,

536
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,920
those are areas where like there's so many damn people

537
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,680
that you just have to be really mindful of

538
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,440
when I just throw out a radius to throw out a radius.

539
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:17,480
I think like North Carolina and Georgia are like that too,

540
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,640
because they're just not that big territorial wise,

541
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,720
so when you throw out a map like that,

542
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:24,200
you could easily like double the population

543
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:27,760
without realizing that you just doubled the population.

544
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:31,520
So is that, is it bad though if I'm maximizing the clicks?

545
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:35,120
Like if my target is the biggest city there,

546
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:38,440
which is Lakeland, and then when I throw the radius,

547
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,760
like it increases population,

548
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,680
because yes, it's adding the smaller towns,

549
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,760
versus, so the other campaigns I set up

550
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,400
were like Winterhaven and Poinciana,

551
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,440
which is even more East, and I didn't put the radius,

552
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,840
at least not at first,

553
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:56,240
because I didn't want that to count Lakeland,

554
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,720
but then it was small, I don't think I got any hits.

555
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,880
Right, some of that is probably because like

556
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,960
when you expanded that Lakeland one,

557
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,560
you probably didn't increase your daily budget, right?

558
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:10,920
I did a little bit, but like not enough to.

559
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,240
Yeah, you just need to do, you just wanna look at,

560
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,640
like if you go to the map and look at that radius,

561
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,880
if you wanna go back to where the locations are.

562
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,720
Sure.

563
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,560
And then that, yeah, show that spot where the road,

564
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:26,920
where the radius goes, not there on the ads, yep.

565
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:29,120
Yeah, let's see what that looks like.

566
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:33,440
Okay, let's zoom in on that and let's look at, so, okay.

567
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:40,440
If I was to overlay that map with zip codes of that area,

568
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,280
okay, so I want you to imagine that,

569
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:45,360
that line, that 13 mile radius line,

570
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,760
that's not like, that doesn't like cut through a street.

571
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:51,400
If whatever zip code that's touching,

572
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:54,160
you're running ads to that, a whole zip code.

573
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,000
Yeah, it's pretty big.

574
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:55,840
So you're actually, yeah,

575
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:58,120
so you're including more people than you realize,

576
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:01,680
because you probably are kind of touching a zip code

577
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,880
possibly related to Tampa, maybe not.

578
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,760
You're definitely running ads to pretty much

579
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:11,400
all of Winterhaven, probably all of Lake Alford.

580
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,160
Like, does that make sense?

581
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:17,080
So like, even though we think, oh, okay, it's not,

582
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:19,560
that line is not like a definitive line.

583
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,280
Any zip code that line touches,

584
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,040
you're running ads to that whole zip code.

585
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,760
Okay, so yeah, so if you were,

586
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,840
if you were gonna target this area then,

587
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,400
so just knock out the radius and let it run,

588
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:39,320
or together, like, should I just forget Lakeland

589
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:42,000
and just go Winterhaven without the radius,

590
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,560
Auburndale, Lake Alford, like just pick up the smaller guys?

591
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,640
On my other-

592
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:50,880
It seems like you have like another ad for,

593
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,560
you said a whole other ad for Winterhaven and other areas.

594
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:57,000
So you can run like individual ads.

595
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,040
If you just wanna pick up like around Lakeland,

596
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,560
there's that, there's a little city to the south

597
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,080
and there's a little one to the southeast.

598
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:06,120
Like, you can just add those cities into it

599
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:08,960
and you'll see the map just kind of grab that city limit

600
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,280
and grab the other city limit.

601
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:14,600
That's a way to better control that just random radius.

602
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,320
And, but keep it all in one ad.

603
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:20,080
So you wouldn't exclude Lakeland,

604
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,280
Lakeland because it's kind of competitive?

605
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,360
Like I'm-

606
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:30,000
I'm not afraid to, 200,000 is not that big of a deal to me.

607
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,280
That's a good sweet spot, uh-huh.

608
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,120
Okay.

609
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,120
It's just that outside of that area,

610
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,040
there's like bigger cities

611
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,400
or cities that even have a hundred thousand people in it.

612
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,080
So that's where you go, ooh, okay.

613
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:43,120
That could get really expensive really fast.

614
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:45,600
Cause now I'm running my ad to 400,000 people

615
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:49,080
or 500,000 people, which isn't terrible,

616
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:52,840
but I have to make sure my daily budget

617
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:55,760
and my bids and everything else are aligned

618
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,160
to be successful to run ads to that many people.

619
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,040
Right, okay.

620
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,000
Okay, thank you, yeah.

621
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,560
We need to put it all into one ad because yeah,

622
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:08,880
it doesn't make sense to have three campaigns going.

623
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,440
I was like just trying to test it out,

624
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:12,240
but now my budget is all over the place

625
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:16,080
and it's getting complicated, so.

626
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:19,680
Yeah, the only thing with that is like you'll have your,

627
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:28,800
like Winter Haven's its own little spot

628
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,120
and it's got a decent enough population

629
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,600
that like maybe they're not,

630
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:35,160
they may not respond to a Lakeland concrete site.

631
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:37,840
Right. Maybe they will.

632
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:39,800
So that's something, it's not that you can't do that,

633
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,200
it's just a thing to think about.

634
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,680
Okay, yeah.

635
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,240
I would just run numbers, run numbers for both cities.

636
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:49,040
That'll, the data directs me.

637
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:52,560
So like if there's good population, good data,

638
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,360
I can make some ads, there's competition.

639
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:57,800
Like I might just set up a Winter Haven concrete site

640
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,120
and go for another business owner.

641
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,360
Yeah, okay.

642
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:02,200
You know what I mean?

643
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,600
Yeah, I guess I was getting kind of almost like panicky

644
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,560
because he's already paying me.

645
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,280
So I'm like, I need to produce, you know?

646
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,120
Like I don't wanna lose him.

647
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,680
I'm so sorry, but I have to run.

648
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:14,480
I didn't realize the time getting late.

649
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,320
That's okay.

650
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,320
All right, no problem.

651
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,520
Appreciate your help.

652
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,120
All right, good luck.

653
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:20,360
Thank you, bye.

654
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,200
Bye.

655
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:22,960
All right.

656
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,360
Let's see here.

657
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:29,960
Okay, Boya, I'm gonna,

658
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:31,600
remind me how to pronounce your name again.

659
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:32,440
I'm sorry.

660
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:34,440
Hi, ladies.

661
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:35,760
Ladies, okay.

662
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,080
Did I say that right?

663
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:37,920
Yes.

664
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,880
I was like, there's like four ways to say that.

665
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,320
I don't even wanna attempt to blurt it out.

666
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:43,040
It's fine, it doesn't matter.

667
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,240
That's okay.

668
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,640
All right.

669
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:47,960
And you were having issues with your,

670
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:49,760
trying to set up your conversions, right?

671
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,840
Yeah, so I'm new.

672
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:54,840
This is the first time I'm gonna set up a campaign.

673
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:55,680
Nice.

674
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,840
Managers accounts.

675
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:00,280
And I also have a Google account.

676
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,120
Okay.

677
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:02,760
I don't think the Google account,

678
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:06,160
it's not a sub account, it's just a Google account.

679
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,480
So I tried to set up a sub account

680
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,480
under my managers accounts.

681
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:11,840
Yeah.

682
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:16,840
And I noticed that the questions that I get to set it up

683
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,720
are different than the ones explained in the training.

684
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:21,600
So I was like a little bit lost.

685
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:22,440
I didn't know.

686
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:23,640
Yeah.

687
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:26,120
So maybe I can share my screen.

688
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:26,960
Yeah.

689
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:29,480
Okay.

690
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:32,720
Yeah, let's do that.

691
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:37,720
Yeah, and there's been some changes.

692
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,920
And that's why I asked you if you can hop on

693
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,440
because there's people that are,

694
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,560
I've been getting more and more of these same questions.

695
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,760
So what, I think I said it last week too,

696
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:50,040
is like what I suspect is happening

697
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:54,520
is that Google is rolling out a new interface for people

698
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:56,320
and maybe a new setup,

699
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:59,240
but it hasn't fully flipped across the board

700
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:03,440
because I just set up seven new ads this week.

701
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,920
I didn't run across what you're talking about at all.

702
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,720
So it's like, okay.

703
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:10,640
So it just maybe hasn't hit my interface yet.

704
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:13,320
So, and these are like normal things that happens.

705
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:16,000
Like it's not a huge issue.

706
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,160
So, okay.

707
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:18,560
Do you see my screen?

708
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:19,400
I do.

709
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:20,240
Okay.

710
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:24,120
So the first, the initial problem I had like disappeared.

711
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:25,080
I don't know what happened.

712
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:28,960
So my initial problem was that it showed a screen

713
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:32,200
where I had to enter like a sub page.

714
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:35,080
I had to choose, first I had to choose

715
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:37,680
the goal of my campaign.

716
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:43,840
And I chose views, page views, like you told me to.

717
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,880
It asked me to enter a sub page.

718
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,080
I sent you a screenshot.

719
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:52,280
You have like everything turned on though.

720
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:56,360
It looks like YouTube, Gmail, search, display, discover.

721
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:58,120
Like we don't want any of those.

722
00:46:58,120 --> 00:46:59,360
We just want search.

723
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:01,560
Okay.

724
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:03,400
So, all right.

725
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:04,240
Let me...

726
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:07,520
Can we go back to the beginning?

727
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:08,360
Yeah.

728
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:09,180
Just say discard.

729
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:10,020
Yeah.

730
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:16,040
All right.

731
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:17,720
So I'm in my,

732
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:20,440
I'm in my...

733
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:22,280
This is a regular Google account.

734
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:23,120
Manager's account.

735
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:23,960
Yeah.

736
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:25,560
I'm in my manager's account.

737
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:27,520
Okay.

738
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,440
So I'm going to go and set up a campaign

739
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:31,600
or do I need to set up?

740
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:36,600
Well, first I try to set up a sub account.

741
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:39,880
Let me see.

742
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:40,720
Where did I?

743
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:41,560
Okay.

744
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:45,600
Yeah.

745
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:48,240
You know, the, like finding the sub account settings

746
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:51,240
is also like different than...

747
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:52,080
Yeah.

748
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:52,920
Like account.

749
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:53,760
Yeah.

750
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,320
Hit account settings.

751
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:57,120
Account settings.

752
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:57,960
Wait.

753
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:58,780
Account settings.

754
00:47:58,780 --> 00:47:59,620
Yeah.

755
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:00,460
Okay.

756
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:03,760
Yeah.

757
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:04,580
Let me see here.

758
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:05,420
Hang on.

759
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:06,260
I just want to look at something real quick.

760
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:07,100
Oh, so this is,

761
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:08,480
this is my sub account that I made.

762
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:12,560
Mm-hmm.

763
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:15,520
Hold on one second.

764
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:16,360
Okay.

765
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:22,600
Okay.

766
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:23,560
All right.

767
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:25,440
Let's do this just because...

768
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:26,920
Okay.

769
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:29,240
This is a manager account and that's fine.

770
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:33,260
There has been some changes to the MCC stuff.

771
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,880
You would, since you don't have an ad already,

772
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,440
let's go to the one above that, that 931.

773
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Let's just start with a regular Google ads account

774
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:43,840
because what?

775
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:45,600
There's this like thousand dollar limit

776
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:47,880
that's really weird that Google's done.

777
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:49,960
So, okay.

778
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:52,320
Is this the account that you're asking questions about

779
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:53,160
or this is a sub account?

780
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:55,400
No, so this is, this is just a,

781
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:57,600
now I'm in my Google accounts.

782
00:48:58,920 --> 00:48:59,760
Yeah.

783
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:00,760
This is regular Google ad account.

784
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:01,600
This is, this is fine.

785
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,640
This is a regular Google ad account.

786
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:05,900
All right.

787
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:07,020
So I don't need to make a sub account.

788
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:09,860
I just go straight to make a campaign.

789
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:12,980
Well, we can, well, not here.

790
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:15,900
This is, this was a campaign you already set up

791
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:17,660
and it looks like it got suspended.

792
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:20,140
Where does it say?

793
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:21,980
Oh no, you know, you remember that I,

794
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:23,820
that I know that's another camp.

795
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:25,740
You remember a couple of weeks ago

796
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:30,340
that I asked you how to see the exact search volume

797
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:32,140
and you helped me set up a campaign,

798
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:33,900
just like a fake campaign.

799
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:35,820
That's the one.

800
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:39,580
Okay.

801
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:40,420
Oh, that's the fake one.

802
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:43,260
But it's unsuspended, it's already unsuspended.

803
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:44,100
Okay.

804
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:44,920
All right.

805
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:45,760
Okay.

806
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:46,600
Okay.

807
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:48,700
So in this account, you have something happening.

808
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:51,660
You have a campaign, right?

809
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:55,160
So this is its own individual account.

810
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:57,940
Under the MCC, this would be considered a sub account.

811
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:01,660
This is just a Google ad account.

812
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:04,500
But this is not a sub account, right?

813
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:05,820
Okay.

814
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:08,340
This is a regular Google ad account.

815
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:09,180
Okay.

816
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:12,060
This is the same thing as a sub account

817
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:13,260
and a manager account.

818
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:14,100
Okay.

819
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:14,920
All right.

820
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:17,300
So as far as like the setup and all that stuff.

821
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:18,140
Okay.

822
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:20,020
What's happening in the, with the MCCs,

823
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:21,780
the manager accounts is like,

824
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:24,120
they're limiting how many ads you can create,

825
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:26,100
how many sub accounts you can create up right,

826
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:29,360
you can create right now until you hit a thousand dollars

827
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:34,360
and another, another account under the Gmail.

828
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:35,260
Okay.

829
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:36,940
So what you'll wanna do is you're gonna,

830
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:39,780
so for like your first, say five, six, seven ads,

831
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:43,060
you're just gonna wanna set up individual Google ad accounts

832
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:46,500
and then you can bring them by invitation

833
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:49,300
under the MCC to be managed.

834
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:51,380
Is that necessary or no?

835
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:54,380
You don't have to, but at some point you'll hit like,

836
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:56,980
I can't remember if it's 14 or 17.

837
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:58,980
You can set up like 14 or 17,

838
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:01,900
like Google ad accounts under one Gmail

839
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:04,320
before you have to have another one.

840
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:05,160
Yeah. Okay.

841
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:05,980
But I'm not there yet.

842
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:06,820
So. No.

843
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:09,400
So for right now, this would just be more,

844
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,960
it'll be, it'll simplify it for you for right now.

845
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:12,800
And this is just something

846
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:15,760
because Google changed some stuff on us.

847
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:19,040
So we're just, this is the best way to adapt.

848
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:21,400
It's one of those things we've covered on office hours.

849
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:24,980
I've asked for it to be put into the training for you guys.

850
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:27,040
So I'm just still waiting for it to get uploaded

851
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:30,600
for you guys, cause I know it's something that's changed.

852
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:32,480
I think like you weren't, I don't think you were on yet,

853
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:35,360
but I've been where I know they're in the works

854
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:38,580
of getting the 3.0 stuff done and dialed in,

855
00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:41,980
but I know there's been some like security issues

856
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:43,000
and other things like that.

857
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,240
They're trying to like work out.

858
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:47,480
So can I ask you something?

859
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:48,320
Yes.

860
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:50,760
So how many campaigns can I make

861
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:53,220
under this one Google accounts?

862
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:58,240
It's like, I can't remember the exact number.

863
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,080
Well, okay.

864
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:00,740
Under this one, one.

865
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:01,580
Okay.

866
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:03,240
One to one website.

867
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:05,780
So you can set up different campaigns

868
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:08,820
as long as it's going to the same website.

869
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:10,900
So let's say that you're doing like,

870
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:11,820
I don't know which one this is,

871
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:14,420
but let's say this is a tree one and you're like,

872
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:18,100
well, I really want to focus on like a tree trimming,

873
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:19,140
like whatever.

874
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:21,660
And then I want to do tree removal or whatever.

875
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:24,900
You can set up different campaigns to the same website,

876
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:28,420
but you don't want to set up a new campaign

877
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:30,920
to a different website under this one.

878
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:34,300
You would create a whole new Google's ad account for that.

879
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:35,140
Okay.

880
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:36,640
So only in case, for example,

881
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:41,640
I want to expand my ad to neighboring areas.

882
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:43,840
Yeah, you can set up a-

883
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:45,060
And I need the same websites.

884
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:47,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

885
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:50,380
And otherwise I have to make a new Google accounts.

886
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:52,320
Yeah, and that's easy.

887
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:55,160
You just go to where your icon is, the A,

888
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:57,840
and then you just go to set up new Google ads account.

889
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:59,100
Okay.

890
00:52:59,100 --> 00:52:59,940
Yeah.

891
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:01,500
If you have a full website,

892
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:05,700
the other thing is if you have a full website,

893
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:08,140
let's say you want to go to like your neighborhood

894
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:10,300
to the right, to the east of wherever,

895
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:12,420
you can just make a landing page.

896
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:15,040
So let's say that I have like Jeff's Tree Service

897
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:19,540
and I have like my main location is like Farmington,

898
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:20,500
whatever.

899
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:22,900
And then I want to go to like,

900
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:24,740
I want to run ads and like, you know,

901
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:26,180
Gold Beach or something.

902
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:28,980
I just set up a landing page that'll say

903
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:31,580
Gold Beach tree trimming services or whatever.

904
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:34,820
And I just run my targeted, you know,

905
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:37,220
if I want to target Gold Beach community,

906
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:39,620
I set up a landing page and I just run my ads that way.

907
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:43,740
You can set that up under here if you want to,

908
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:47,940
as long as it all falls under the same big website.

909
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:49,300
Does that make sense?

910
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:52,020
So if I have a proper website

911
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:55,900
and I make an extra landing page

912
00:53:56,300 --> 00:54:01,300
for the same niche but a different area.

913
00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:03,660
Yeah.

914
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:04,500
I can do it.

915
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:07,580
I wouldn't be like, I wouldn't run my like,

916
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:11,540
I wouldn't jump off the bat and run like one in one state

917
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:13,380
and one in another state.

918
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:14,820
Cause that would be weird.

919
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:18,060
But if it's like, if I'm in Farmington,

920
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:20,400
I don't know where Farmington is, I'm just making it up.

921
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:23,700
And Gold Beach is the community right next to it.

922
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:24,680
That would make sense.

923
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:27,160
If you want to try to expand in an area,

924
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:28,400
that's one way that you can,

925
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,680
that's one way you can do this.

926
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:32,800
Or you can just set up many one-pagers

927
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:36,000
and run individual, yeah.

928
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,560
Okay.

929
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:38,400
All right.

930
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:42,760
So yeah, so I have this Google account.

931
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:44,840
Can I just talk with you,

932
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:47,960
if I start making a campaign that it looks,

933
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:51,040
I suppose it's going to look more or less the same

934
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,600
than what you explained in the training,

935
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:55,840
but I'm not really sure.

936
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:58,280
I think it has to do with the fact that my,

937
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:03,680
my location is, I think my location.

938
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:04,520
Yeah.

939
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:07,860
I think the last time that, I think that's an issue.

940
00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:09,320
Yeah.

941
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:11,600
I don't know about, it was the manager's account.

942
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:15,200
I don't know about his Google accounts.

943
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:16,040
Right.

944
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:18,640
I think there's a,

945
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:20,840
I really think that there is a,

946
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:26,240
there's an interface issue with what you guys have out there.

947
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:29,480
Like when I go here, like if I click website traffic,

948
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:33,160
and it's asking you, like it's,

949
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:38,640
I'm sorry.

950
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:40,560
It pains in the butt.

951
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:41,920
Like, okay, like here,

952
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,640
it's asking you to like run a tag on your website

953
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:45,720
and do all that.

954
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:46,980
I just hit continue.

955
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:49,040
And then what is it asking?

956
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:51,240
The one action, I just leave it?

957
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:52,080
Yeah.

958
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:53,440
It just means, you're just telling it like,

959
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:54,280
yeah, I hear you.

960
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:55,120
I'm just going to ignore you.

961
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:56,720
Okay. Okay.

962
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,440
And then you go down to select your campaign

963
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:00,960
and it's typically search, right?

964
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:01,800
That's what we want to run.

965
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:02,620
That's what we want to run.

966
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:04,120
And then you hit continue.

967
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:05,720
Just hit continue.

968
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:08,440
Okay. Don't enter my website.

969
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:11,720
You can name it if you want, whatever.

970
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:13,720
It could be a tree tree or whatever it is,

971
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:16,120
whatever you want to name it that you remember.

972
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:19,920
Concrete.

973
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:20,760
Yeah.

974
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:22,800
Okay.

975
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:26,520
Okay. So this is all,

976
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:31,040
these are all the same steps that you encounter as well.

977
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:33,160
Yeah. Go to clicks.

978
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:36,160
And then I always set my maximum CPC here,

979
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,640
but if you don't know it, don't worry about it.

980
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:38,480
Just leave it.

981
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:39,740
Just uncheck that box.

982
00:56:39,740 --> 00:56:40,580
You can come back to it.

983
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:42,000
I can do it later on.

984
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,080
If you don't have that data,

985
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:44,340
I like when I set this up,

986
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:46,060
I like to have the data with me.

987
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:47,320
If you don't have the data right now,

988
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:49,120
we're just kind of walking through steps.

989
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:50,480
I mean, I don't have the data.

990
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:52,800
Let's put it in.

991
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,400
I mean, what do you mean with data?

992
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:58,800
I mean, I have the CPC that is the minimum

993
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:01,800
and the maximum that is mentioned in the Google ads.

994
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:06,800
What's the maximum CPC that you saw for this campaign?

995
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:10,280
The maximum was 1538.

996
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:14,640
Okay. So I would put my max CPC at 1539.

997
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,040
Okay.

998
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:23,120
Is that a period or a comma?

999
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:25,120
Sorry, I can't tell on my end.

1000
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:26,260
It's a comma.

1001
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:27,100
Okay.

1002
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:31,240
So this is, I just leave it like that?

1003
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:32,400
Okay. Yeah.

1004
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:37,840
You see here, I have to change.

1005
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:38,960
Okay. I know. I hear you.

1006
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:39,800
Hang on.

1007
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:42,720
We want to get rid of the search partners

1008
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:44,160
then display network.

1009
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,640
They're always going to auto fill that.

1010
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:46,760
We always remove it.

1011
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:48,900
Both. Okay.

1012
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:50,000
Okay.

1013
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:53,480
Now we go to look, enter another location, right?

1014
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:55,300
And then type in that area.

1015
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:02,280
That's 306 million people

1016
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:04,120
you're going to run your ad to right now.

1017
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:05,760
Oh, okay.

1018
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:08,080
Just type in the city and the state.

1019
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:12,160
I mean, you can, but I don't think $20 a day

1020
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:13,280
is going to help you there.

1021
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:14,120
Yeah.

1022
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:19,080
Right.

1023
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:20,160
Okay.

1024
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:21,000
All right.

1025
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:24,540
And then location, you're going to hit location options.

1026
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,640
Presence, people and or regularly,

1027
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:28,680
and you're included here.

1028
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:29,520
There you go.

1029
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:30,340
Okay.

1030
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:32,560
Language is English.

1031
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:34,840
Yeah. Yep.

1032
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:35,820
Hit next.

1033
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:37,760
Okay.

1034
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:41,680
And this is, okay.

1035
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:45,000
So this is something I'm currently exploring.

1036
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:47,640
This is it asking you

1037
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:50,920
if you want to just let them kind of run your,

1038
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:54,800
like, this is like allowing AI Gemini to,

1039
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:56,600
that's Google's AI is Gemini,

1040
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:58,860
to let them like set everything up.

1041
00:58:58,860 --> 00:59:01,840
That's your headlines, your description,

1042
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:03,260
instead of how we have it.

1043
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:06,920
I'm like, I'm not convinced yet,

1044
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:09,080
but I'm not like, I don't hate it either.

1045
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:10,860
So I'm still trying to figure it out.

1046
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:13,800
So this is that where if you want to put your URL in,

1047
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:17,040
you can put it in and it might help you generate

1048
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:19,160
a bunch of headlines and keywords and all that,

1049
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:22,660
or you can hit skip and just do it manually.

1050
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:24,320
So it's your call.

1051
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:27,000
I'm going to try.

1052
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:27,840
Yeah.

1053
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:43,080
Okay.

1054
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:49,280
So you, you've done it before.

1055
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:54,260
What makes your product service unique?

1056
00:59:54,260 --> 00:59:55,100
So I have to-

1057
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:56,200
Oh, interesting.

1058
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:58,100
All the ones I do, it actually pulls it in.

1059
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:00,940
So what you can do is go back to your homepage,

1060
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:02,660
your one pager.

1061
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:03,560
Yeah.

1062
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:04,480
Yeah, go to your one pager.

1063
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:06,400
Let's go down to what, what's your intro paragraph?

1064
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,160
Let's just see what that looks like.

1065
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,400
Right. And then just copy that,

1066
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:13,560
like just copy and paste that into the description

1067
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:15,520
and see what it does.

1068
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:16,720
Yeah.

1069
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:18,880
Like a part of it or how much should I-

1070
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:19,720
Just the whole thing.

1071
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:21,400
Just the whole opening paragraph.

1072
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:22,240
Right there.

1073
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:23,060
Yep. Just that.

1074
01:00:23,060 --> 01:00:23,960
There you go.

1075
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:25,920
Copy that and then paste that in there.

1076
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:28,800
Let's see what it does.

1077
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:32,240
Hit generate.

1078
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:36,640
And again, I don't know if this is like

1079
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:37,920
going to be awesome all the time,

1080
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:40,360
but it is something I'm kind of like interesting.

1081
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:43,580
Now I'm not,

1082
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:46,320
I don't really trust them on all of their keywords.

1083
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:47,800
I don't know if that's going to be up to you

1084
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:48,960
to set your own keywords,

1085
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:50,240
set them up as phrase match.

1086
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:52,480
These are set up as broad match right now,

1087
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:55,200
but like, but we can, like we can just,

1088
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:56,400
let's just leave them for right now.

1089
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:59,120
You can do this later and then go down.

1090
01:00:59,120 --> 01:00:59,960
Right.

1091
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:00,920
Okay. Just a question here.

1092
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:02,240
Yeah.

1093
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:04,960
Enter products or services to advertise.

1094
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:07,280
We don't have any that we're running services.

1095
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:08,880
Yeah. You can leave it blank.

1096
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:10,800
And then another question about the keywords.

1097
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:14,240
So the, the keyword that is in,

1098
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:16,640
that's having the most searches

1099
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:20,280
is concrete companies near me.

1100
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:24,320
I don't see, so I can add it.

1101
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:25,160
Yeah. Okay.

1102
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:28,240
Is there a difference between the, for example,

1103
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:31,520
concrete companies and concrete companies near me?

1104
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:33,800
Is the near me making a difference?

1105
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:34,640
Yeah. Yeah.

1106
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:36,880
I talked about this with the first person today.

1107
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:39,600
So like, this is where,

1108
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:43,760
like no one types in concrete companies near me

1109
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:45,760
or concrete contractors near me, right?

1110
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:48,280
Google auto fills that for us.

1111
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:51,000
So when we're typing something and let's say that, like,

1112
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,640
I don't know, what's your favorite type of food?

1113
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:56,720
Like your favorite type of restaurant to go out to, right?

1114
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:58,160
So whatever, let's say that,

1115
01:01:58,160 --> 01:01:59,800
like if you're standing in the middle of somewhere

1116
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:01,200
and you don't know where something is,

1117
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:04,440
but you, you want that food, you're going to type in,

1118
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:06,360
like for me, it might be like sushi.

1119
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:07,600
I might type in sushi

1120
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:09,800
and it's going to auto-populate near me.

1121
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:11,120
And I'm going to be like, yeah, near me.

1122
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:11,960
I want that.

1123
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:13,880
I want to know what's near me, right?

1124
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:15,720
Yeah. So, yeah.

1125
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:17,760
Okay. Now remember this is,

1126
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:20,760
this is running as broad match.

1127
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:24,840
So we want to do either exact match or phrase match here.

1128
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:26,480
Okay.

1129
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:27,320
Okay.

1130
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:30,280
Yeah. You can go back through this later.

1131
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:31,600
Okay. Okay.

1132
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:33,600
All right. And then now let's scroll down

1133
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
and let's see what it filled in for you.

1134
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:39,240
Keep going, keep going.

1135
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:41,480
Oh, it didn't fill in any headlines for you.

1136
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,320
Really interesting.

1137
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:45,720
Okay. What I think this is,

1138
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:49,680
is because it's a, because it's a one pager,

1139
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:52,000
it's recognizing Weebly.com.

1140
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,520
I bet you that's wrong, which isn't a big deal.

1141
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:56,520
It just means we just manually have to do it.

1142
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:59,400
So the AI may not be working for you guys right now

1143
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:02,680
because you're using Weebly.com, right?

1144
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:04,120
So much is fine.

1145
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:05,680
AI is not that smart yet.

1146
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:07,440
But I mean, this kind of sets you up,

1147
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:09,600
concrete contractors, concrete company,

1148
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:11,600
like you just, this is where you got to go back

1149
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:14,000
through the training and nail those things down.

1150
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,040
So then once you're here, you just kind of set it up.

1151
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:18,400
You just follow the training from here.

1152
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:21,320
But you can see how it didn't take us through

1153
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:24,360
any of those other steps that you were asking about earlier.

1154
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:26,840
And even that one with the page view, I just ignore it.

1155
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:27,680
Okay, fine, great.

1156
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:28,840
I'm gonna ignore you.

1157
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:31,720
All that is, is a tracking mechanism.

1158
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:35,000
The problem was I couldn't ignore it.

1159
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,680
I couldn't skip, I couldn't continue.

1160
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:40,080
I know, but I also, when I looked at it,

1161
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:41,160
you were trying to run ads

1162
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:43,000
to like five different Google platforms.

1163
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,840
So I think something happened in the setup,

1164
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:47,960
which is probably why it directed you to say,

1165
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:50,600
no, I need this, I need this, I need this.

1166
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:52,400
And you're like, I don't have it.

1167
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:54,280
Well, it's because you're probably,

1168
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:55,120
just like when you went in

1169
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:57,880
and it auto-populated display and partners,

1170
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:02,480
it's an easy one to forget, but that's most likely why.

1171
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:03,440
So.

1172
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:07,560
Okay, can I just, or as I go back to the keywords,

1173
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:12,320
that were mentioned, like automatically by AI.

1174
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:13,600
Yeah, I don't really trust them,

1175
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:15,920
but you can just trust and verify.

1176
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:18,400
Just, you can look at them, but.

1177
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:19,400
Does it make a difference?

1178
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:22,520
I mean, do I need to be very, does it make a difference

1179
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:27,440
that there's like five keywords generated automatically

1180
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:30,560
and I don't think they're gonna show up?

1181
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:33,720
I am not, I have not been a fan of any of the keywords

1182
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:35,960
that the AI has recommended to me.

1183
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:36,960
I just delete them.

1184
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:38,680
I'm the expert.

1185
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:40,360
I know I've done my own research.

1186
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:42,480
I looked at the Google keyword data.

1187
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:44,600
That's the stuff that I'm gonna do.

1188
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:45,440
Yeah, okay.

1189
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:49,280
What I was saying is that I'm experimenting with it,

1190
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:54,280
helping me like maybe throw out headlines and descriptions

1191
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:56,160
and I can go, oh, I like those.

1192
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:57,760
Okay, those are great.

1193
01:04:57,760 --> 01:04:59,800
I'm just, I'm experimenting with it.

1194
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:03,400
I don't know that I love it yet, but I'm trying.

1195
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:05,200
There's other things I'm doing with AI right now

1196
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:06,520
that I've been very impressed with.

1197
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:09,680
So I'm trying to not be so old

1198
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:12,960
and I'm trying to be open to some new ideas.

1199
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:16,360
So it's just something to try, but yeah.

1200
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:17,640
So otherwise you just follow the training.

1201
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:18,480
Just do it yourself.

1202
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:20,280
Man, you can do it, follow it in.

1203
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:22,120
Yeah, okay.

1204
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:26,320
Just as far as their keyword ideas, I'm not a fan of them

1205
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:29,440
but you can also go, oh, I know I've actually seen it

1206
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:30,760
because you should already know your keywords

1207
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,120
before you set your ad up.

1208
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:34,040
So it's like, yep, I'm gonna use that one.

1209
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:34,880
I'm gonna use that one.

1210
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:35,720
Nope, nope, nope.

1211
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:37,240
Yes, yes, yes, no, no, no.

1212
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:39,480
So I call that trust but verify.

1213
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:40,680
So just look at them.

1214
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:42,240
If they look good, yeah, oh cool.

1215
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:43,920
I was gonna run that ad anyways.

1216
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:47,520
Great, if not, I'm out and you're out.

1217
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:49,640
You just make your own like you should, right?

1218
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:50,480
All right.

1219
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:52,360
When is the next time that you're gonna be online

1220
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:53,560
just in case that I have?

1221
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:55,760
Good question.

1222
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:56,760
Let me see.

1223
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:58,280
What does next week look like?

1224
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:05,440
Tuesday'd be cool, but I know Nick goes on Tuesday mornings.

1225
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:10,440
So let's see, it'll probably be Thursday the 27th.

1226
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:13,040
I typically try to come on between 10 and 10.30 a.m.

1227
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:15,440
my time if I'm here in Los Angeles.

1228
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:18,400
So that works for me.

1229
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:20,240
Okay, all right.

1230
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:21,160
Thank you.

1231
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:22,480
Yeah, you're very welcome.

1232
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:23,600
Bye-bye.

1233
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:25,320
Bye, take care.

1234
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:26,160
All right.

1235
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:29,440
Let's see here.

1236
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:30,680
Hello, Jeff.

1237
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:31,680
Hi, how's it going?

1238
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:34,360
I'm good, I'm good.

1239
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:36,800
So yeah, I'm from, I'm in Australia.

1240
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:38,200
Okay.

1241
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:42,160
Yeah, I just, I mean, I don't think I have,

1242
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:44,960
there's no issues yet, but I just want to make sure

1243
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:49,640
whether I'm just on the, that I'm not doing anything wrong.

1244
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:52,520
So I'll just quickly share my screen

1245
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:55,480
because what's happened is, where's the share button?

1246
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:56,320
Yeah.

1247
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:01,760
Best of three.

1248
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:06,000
So in my, you know, the normal Google account,

1249
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,840
so once again, just press the share button.

1250
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:11,560
Is it even sharing?

1251
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:13,160
It's not yet.

1252
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:15,280
I'm not seeing it yet.

1253
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:17,560
Yeah, because I'm just clicking the share button,

1254
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:19,120
but it's not seems to go.

1255
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:23,680
Okay, I don't know what's going on.

1256
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:25,320
I'll just explain it.

1257
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:29,680
In the normal Google account, I've spent more than $1,000.

1258
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:31,080
Okay.

1259
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:36,760
And now I have to pause the ad

1260
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:41,160
because my client here, she has gone on a holiday.

1261
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:44,160
So, but she is just going to start when she comes back.

1262
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:45,680
She's gone on a three week holiday.

1263
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:48,280
So the crew is not, they're not working.

1264
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:49,920
It's in the tree service space.

1265
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:54,720
Now that I, since I've crossed $1,000,

1266
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:58,000
I've gone back to my MCC account

1267
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,880
and added this account as a sub account.

1268
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:04,200
Now I need to, when I try, like what I don't know

1269
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:07,360
is I'm also doing a due diligence on another area,

1270
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:11,280
which I'm looking to start the, start an add-on,

1271
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:12,920
but I'm not there yet because I'm not sure

1272
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:14,800
if that's, if I really want to go into there

1273
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:16,480
because of ICPC.

1274
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:20,680
In terms of like, when I try to look at, okay,

1275
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:22,080
just to see if I've got everything,

1276
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:26,960
it says I can't add like the payment or stuff

1277
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:28,800
seems to be there.

1278
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:31,840
Because I'm just not sure if my,

1279
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:34,920
if I can link the same credit card to my MCC account,

1280
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:38,840
like this, like how I've done for the other account.

1281
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:40,800
And do you think the card's be there?

1282
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:41,920
Yeah.

1283
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:44,720
Yeah, I have all of them set up on all of the same,

1284
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:47,080
either PayPal or credit card right now.

1285
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:50,200
When I have, I have multiple MCCs.

1286
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:54,120
I have, they're under multiple emails or multiple gmails.

1287
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:57,760
Like I very rarely, once in a while I get a problem,

1288
01:08:57,760 --> 01:09:00,720
but for the most part, it's like, hey, what are you doing?

1289
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:01,560
I just hit it.

1290
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:03,320
I just send an appeal and it gets appealed.

1291
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:06,720
So yeah, I haven't really had any issues.

1292
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:09,280
Okay, cool.

1293
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:11,680
I'll just try it and see what happens.

1294
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:13,960
I was just, it was slightly fearful

1295
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:17,080
the fact that it might ban me or suspend me or something.

1296
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:18,400
So I just didn't want that.

1297
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:21,760
You know, if it does, it's typically,

1298
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:24,880
it's typically just because like it,

1299
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:29,040
it happens so fast and it like,

1300
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:31,360
it might trigger just an auto like,

1301
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:32,520
oh, something's happening.

1302
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:35,880
So your bank and everyone just hits stop.

1303
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:38,280
And you just, typically those are easy ones.

1304
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:40,960
You just appeal and it comes back within a day or two.

1305
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:43,280
So typically that's what I see is that.

1306
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:44,360
And that's it.

1307
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:47,520
That is like, I mean, that could happen to me at the store.

1308
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:49,920
You know, it's like, those aren't really big issues.

1309
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:51,200
It's like, I get a notification.

1310
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:52,840
Hey, are you using your card?

1311
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:53,880
You're like, yeah, that's me.

1312
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:54,920
Okay, your card's fine.

1313
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:56,200
Go ahead and use it again.

1314
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:57,520
It's kind of the same thing.

1315
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:59,560
I wouldn't be too worried about it.

1316
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:00,400
Yeah.

1317
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:01,220
All right.

1318
01:10:01,220 --> 01:10:02,060
Okay.

1319
01:10:02,060 --> 01:10:02,880
Yeah.

1320
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:05,520
And generally with, when the client comes and says,

1321
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:07,800
I will go with chatting shop,

1322
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:10,400
we're going for three weeks holiday.

1323
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:12,840
I mean, my initial reaction was, yeah, of course,

1324
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:14,440
if you can't earn money, how can you pay me?

1325
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:16,520
So we'll pause it.

1326
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:18,920
I mean, I just said, I'll just stop sending leads to you.

1327
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:20,720
I didn't say all the other details.

1328
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:25,560
I mean, usually like, you know, if I'm doing this,

1329
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:28,520
if I'm earning money through this and that's my only,

1330
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:31,240
like, do you just say, yes, I'll accommodate that?

1331
01:10:31,240 --> 01:10:33,200
Like generally for people.

1332
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:35,760
Have you had an instance like this

1333
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:38,760
where they've gone on holiday and you had to just stop it?

1334
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:41,880
Yeah.

1335
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:47,080
Yes, I've had, I've had, yeah, I've had, you know,

1336
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:51,600
you know, deaths in the family, you know, recently,

1337
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:54,040
like fires, like someone lost their home.

1338
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:58,680
I had a guy who like, you know,

1339
01:10:58,680 --> 01:11:01,040
not saying this in a political stance,

1340
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:04,560
but like in our country, my country, like, you know,

1341
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:07,760
we're, they're like mass deporting a lot of people

1342
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:10,240
that are like undocumented workers and my friends.

1343
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:12,040
Well, I had a guy, his whole crew got clipped

1344
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:12,880
and got sent away.

1345
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:15,200
It's, and he's like, bro, I just lost my whole crew.

1346
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:16,160
I'm like, I got you.

1347
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:17,120
I'll hit pause.

1348
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:20,080
Yeah, it just depends on the relationship you have.

1349
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:23,520
Like I've had people now for like four or five years

1350
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:24,480
that are awesome.

1351
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:28,800
You know, so it's like, it just kind of depends.

1352
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:30,800
If it's like the very beginning

1353
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:33,560
and they're kind of like, kind of a difficult client,

1354
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:35,600
I'd be like, I'm just going to find, like, you know what?

1355
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:37,560
I got three weeks to find somebody new.

1356
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:39,440
Yeah.

1357
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:41,200
Like I'm firing you, you're just not worth it.

1358
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:43,840
But if they're a really good client and it's whatever,

1359
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:45,160
I got you.

1360
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:46,000
I got you.

1361
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:46,840
I'll see you when you get back.

1362
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:47,680
Okay.

1363
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:48,520
Yeah.

1364
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:50,120
Does that help?

1365
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:50,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1366
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:53,640
I mean, with this client, it's still early on.

1367
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:57,120
Like they've been with me for a month, solid.

1368
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:57,960
Yeah.

1369
01:11:57,960 --> 01:12:01,600
So, but it's, and they just, and she didn't mention it

1370
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:03,800
even before I engaged, I brought her on

1371
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:07,920
that they might be going on holiday in late February, so.

1372
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:10,040
So it's not like a surprise or a shout out.

1373
01:12:10,040 --> 01:12:11,200
Yeah.

1374
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:12,120
No, no, no.

1375
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:13,800
So, yeah.

1376
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:16,240
I just, see how it goes, so, yeah.

1377
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:17,080
All good.

1378
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:17,920
Thanks.

1379
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:18,760
Thanks for the word.

1380
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:20,240
Unless you're getting, oh, you're welcome.

1381
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:23,000
Unless you're getting like a weird vibe from them,

1382
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:25,760
it sounds like they were very upfront with you.

1383
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:28,960
So what I will say to that is like,

1384
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:33,120
what we should be charging these people

1385
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:35,120
is not all Google ad spend.

1386
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:38,280
So if you think this is going to be successful,

1387
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:40,880
whether with this business owner or there's others

1388
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:43,440
that are potentially out there, like, you know,

1389
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:47,800
in the future, I would be more like maybe,

1390
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:50,440
because you're trying to do SEO as well.

1391
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:51,280
Yes.

1392
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:54,560
You're like, I will say that,

1393
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:57,480
kind of thinking of something similar

1394
01:12:57,480 --> 01:12:58,440
to what you're talking about,

1395
01:12:58,440 --> 01:13:02,680
like I've reduced my monthly fee for people,

1396
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:04,800
but I'm still going to have you pay me while you're gone,

1397
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:07,440
because I'm still doing work on yours.

1398
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:08,840
I'm still doing things.

1399
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:10,840
Now, if it's the very, very beginning

1400
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:13,920
and you haven't fully moved into building a full website yet,

1401
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:16,760
and you're pretty much just running Google ads only,

1402
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:18,520
then maybe you could be like, all right,

1403
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:19,560
I'm just going to be cool about it.

1404
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:20,760
I'm not going to be a jerk.

1405
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:22,680
But like, as time goes on, let's say this,

1406
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:24,160
let's say you're with this client,

1407
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:26,120
this time comes around next year,

1408
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:27,920
and they're like, hey, I'm going on.

1409
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:29,240
You're like, that's cool, I got you.

1410
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:30,520
I'll tell you what, for the next month,

1411
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:33,800
I'll just reduce half your fee for this month

1412
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:34,640
while you're gone.

1413
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:37,440
That allows me to still work and do this stuff

1414
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:38,840
on your behalf while you're gone.

1415
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:41,920
But I'll turn off some of the paid stuff

1416
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:43,680
I have going da-da-da-da-da.

1417
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:45,120
And basically you're telling them like,

1418
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:46,720
I'll give that savings to you.

1419
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:49,480
Like enjoy a beer while you're out on me type of thing.

1420
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:52,040
And then, so that's setting up a good tone.

1421
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:54,440
And it's not like, right?

1422
01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:56,200
Because we're not just running Google ads.

1423
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:58,280
Like your goal, the main play is SEO.

1424
01:13:58,280 --> 01:13:59,120
Exactly.

1425
01:13:59,120 --> 01:13:59,960
Okay.

1426
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:01,680
So in the very beginning, I can understand.

1427
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:02,920
You're like, okay, I'll hit pause.

1428
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:05,000
I'll see you next month, blah, blah, blah.

1429
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:05,840
No problem.

1430
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:06,680
Yeah.

1431
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:07,520
Okay.

1432
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:08,340
Makes sense, makes sense.

1433
01:14:08,340 --> 01:14:09,180
Yeah.

1434
01:14:09,180 --> 01:14:10,020
Awesome.

1435
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:10,840
Thank you so much.

1436
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:11,680
You're very welcome, man.

1437
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:12,520
Have a good one.

1438
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:13,360
Glad to see you.

1439
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:14,200
Glad to see your success.

1440
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:15,680
It's awesome.

1441
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:16,520
Thanks.

1442
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:17,340
See ya.

1443
01:14:17,340 --> 01:14:18,180
Bye.

1444
01:14:18,180 --> 01:14:19,020
Yeah, we'll see you later.

1445
01:14:19,020 --> 01:14:19,840
Okay.

1446
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:22,680
Hi.

1447
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:23,640
You have more questions?

1448
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:24,480
I stayed.

1449
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:26,080
Yeah, I sent you a message.

1450
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:29,520
Yeah, just, I'm new to this.

1451
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:32,960
What I still try to understand with the Google ads

1452
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:37,000
is I did the training with Shift before.

1453
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:40,200
They don't work with Google ads, so this is new to me.

1454
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:42,600
What I'm still trying to understand is

1455
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:49,640
how come that we can spend less money on Google ads

1456
01:14:51,740 --> 01:14:53,720
than the business owner?

1457
01:14:53,720 --> 01:14:57,080
Because we're focusing on business owners

1458
01:14:57,080 --> 01:14:59,000
that are running Google ads.

1459
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:03,660
So the sales argument that you're gonna have

1460
01:15:03,660 --> 01:15:05,880
is you're gonna be better off with me

1461
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:07,840
than keep on running your own ads,

1462
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:09,560
or I'm gonna send you,

1463
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:12,200
or is it just I'm gonna send you extra clients

1464
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:14,420
on top of your own Google ads?

1465
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:19,720
I don't really understand yet what the...

1466
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:20,560
Okay.

1467
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:21,800
Have you had that objection yet,

1468
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:22,640
or are you just thinking about it?

1469
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:24,240
I'm not there yet.

1470
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:26,240
I haven't had a business owner yet.

1471
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:28,320
Okay, so, all right.

1472
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:35,480
So I would say don't get too worried about things

1473
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:38,760
that maybe haven't happened yet, right?

1474
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:42,160
And just think of it like this.

1475
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:44,720
If I was, I think you mentioned tree trimming.

1476
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:48,200
Let's say that I had my own tree trimming company,

1477
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:52,800
and I have my own website, I'm running my own Google ads,

1478
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:55,860
I'm doing my own SEO, and I'm killing it.

1479
01:15:56,920 --> 01:15:58,040
Am I gonna talk to you?

1480
01:15:58,040 --> 01:15:59,120
I'm probably not.

1481
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:00,120
No.

1482
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:03,000
Right, unless I'm like, hey, yeah, you know what?

1483
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,880
I'm doing really well here,

1484
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:08,080
but I don't have enough time to go over here.

1485
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:08,920
Do you have anything in this area?

1486
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:09,760
No, I know.

1487
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:11,240
The business owners, for example,

1488
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:14,320
that I'm now listing, they have a Google ads,

1489
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:19,320
but they have a website on page 10, or something.

1490
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:22,560
But what I'm saying is if I'm running Google ads

1491
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:24,740
and I'm successfully doing it,

1492
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:29,680
I'm not going to talk to you, typically,

1493
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:31,080
because I'm doing it fine.

1494
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:32,480
Why am I gonna pay you for something

1495
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:33,320
I'm having success with?

1496
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:35,320
So you mean, okay, so you mean-

1497
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:38,160
It's the people that are running ads

1498
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:42,240
or paying some shit company, some shit agency, SEO,

1499
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:43,840
and they're like, yeah, I'm not getting results

1500
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:44,960
for these people at all.

1501
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:47,280
Those are the people we end up selling to.

1502
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:48,280
Okay, okay, got it.

1503
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:50,320
It's not the people, the people that are doing it

1504
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:52,760
and are successful and are kicking butt,

1505
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:55,280
they're probably not even gonna answer the phone.

1506
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:57,440
And if they are, it's probably gonna be like,

1507
01:16:57,440 --> 01:16:59,200
oh yeah, yeah, I already did that, I don't have,

1508
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:01,520
I'm good, I already did a click.

1509
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:02,920
Unless that person's like,

1510
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:05,320
actually, I wanna expand to this area,

1511
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:06,640
but I don't have the time.

1512
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:08,240
Like, yeah, if you can do something for that,

1513
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:09,280
we can do business.

1514
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:12,680
Because that business owner understands it already.

1515
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:13,720
You're already pre-sold.

1516
01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:17,160
So if they want something from you or want more from you,

1517
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:19,400
that's a business owner you can work with

1518
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:21,680
because they understand that you're an expert

1519
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:24,080
that's gonna go over here and do these things for them,

1520
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:26,360
and they understand the value of it, right?

1521
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:28,880
But the business owner that's comfortable

1522
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:30,960
with where they're at, they're not gonna talk to you.

1523
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:32,000
So don't worry about that.

1524
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,880
They're not gonna wanna buy your stuff

1525
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:35,920
unless they want to expand.

1526
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:39,280
So I have a guy, I had a guy,

1527
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:41,200
I shouldn't say I have him anymore.

1528
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:45,080
He's since retired, but like, he was,

1529
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:48,520
he did a lot of things,

1530
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:51,960
and he wanted to really focus down on one thing.

1531
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:54,400
And I was like, okay, so I was like his expert

1532
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:59,240
for that like silo, that type of specific service

1533
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:01,720
in his business and his overall business.

1534
01:18:01,720 --> 01:18:04,600
And basically what he did is he basically had,

1535
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:07,520
he had a few people internally, and then he had me,

1536
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:10,680
and he had someone else doing some type of like

1537
01:18:10,680 --> 01:18:14,160
social media, like retargeting, stuff like that.

1538
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:17,480
And I mean, the guy was probably spending

1539
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:19,240
80 to 90 grand a month.

1540
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:23,280
Like that guy was making millions of dollars,

1541
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:25,240
but he's also spending like 100 grand a month

1542
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:27,040
on marketing his business.

1543
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:30,240
So like that business owner understood it.

1544
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:33,360
He was fine with me coming in and buying the stuff for me.

1545
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:36,560
But those business owners, you might, you'll find them,

1546
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:39,520
but they're not typically who we're gonna sell to.

1547
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:41,280
Yeah, okay, okay.

1548
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:42,680
Typically the guy we're selling to

1549
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:44,440
or the girl we're selling to is the person

1550
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:47,840
that's like, you see, that's why we wanna talk to them

1551
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:51,080
because there's a barrier.

1552
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:54,280
If I'm just a guy who does concrete and you call me

1553
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:56,120
and I'm like, I already have a website.

1554
01:18:56,120 --> 01:18:58,200
I don't know that stuff, click.

1555
01:18:58,200 --> 01:18:59,400
We're not, good luck.

1556
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:01,680
You have to really convince me it takes a long time.

1557
01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:04,560
If I'm like, yeah, I'm trying and I'm getting my butt kicked

1558
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:07,120
or I was paying these guys $5,000

1559
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:08,320
and they're not getting me anything,

1560
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:11,280
and I'm now a frustrated business owner.

1561
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:13,320
The thing about that is like,

1562
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:15,080
when you call me and talk to me,

1563
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:17,600
I'm either having a problem with it

1564
01:19:18,240 --> 01:19:19,080
or I'm not.

1565
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:20,520
If I am, I'm gonna talk to you.

1566
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:22,440
And if I'm not having a problem with it,

1567
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:24,280
I'm not gonna spend the time talking to you.

1568
01:19:24,280 --> 01:19:25,440
So don't worry about it.

1569
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:28,160
Don't worry about that objection that you have in your head.

1570
01:19:28,160 --> 01:19:30,760
Don't worry about it because that person's gonna tell you

1571
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:34,000
no thank you or buzz off or I'm good and click.

1572
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:37,200
What about from your experience with business owners,

1573
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:41,360
do most of them run their Google ads by themselves

1574
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:44,040
or do they hire an external company?

1575
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:45,760
Hmm.

1576
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:49,600
I don't know how it is in the US.

1577
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:51,000
And in my country in Europe,

1578
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,880
I would say everybody does it, they don't spend money.

1579
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:55,440
They're gonna do it themselves.

1580
01:19:56,360 --> 01:20:00,040
I don't know in the US, the majority of the business owners.

1581
01:20:00,040 --> 01:20:02,360
The small guys, yes, it's the same.

1582
01:20:02,360 --> 01:20:05,080
I mean, I have a guy who I just picked up that's a,

1583
01:20:07,160 --> 01:20:09,000
he's in Austin, okay,

1584
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:12,000
which is like seven and a half million people.

1585
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:17,040
And he had an issue and he went on full panic mode

1586
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:19,400
and blew up his whole business on Google.

1587
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:21,920
Like, I mean, it's like, so when I'm talking to him,

1588
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:23,480
I'm like, you did what?

1589
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:25,000
Like, oh my God.

1590
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:28,760
So to unwind his mistake, like we triple charged him

1591
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:32,120
just to unwind his mistake because it was like,

1592
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:33,760
but that happens.

1593
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:34,800
But when we call him,

1594
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:37,400
we happened to pick him up on a day that he was like,

1595
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:41,480
yes, I need help, I am dying right now.

1596
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,520
He just didn't realize what he did.

1597
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:45,800
And those are the guys that have forever

1598
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:47,440
because they're the people that like,

1599
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:49,320
they are trying to do it themselves,

1600
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:51,440
but they don't understand it or they think they do

1601
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:53,720
or they call the Google ad specialists

1602
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:55,600
and they're like, okay, I'll do this.

1603
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:58,520
They don't realize that Google doesn't wanna help you.

1604
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:01,600
Google's main job is to make money for them.

1605
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:04,160
It's Google experts that you guys get emails from

1606
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:05,000
and all that.

1607
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Those are salespeople.

1608
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,760
They get commission on how much money you spend.

1609
01:21:09,720 --> 01:21:11,600
They don't care about you making money.

1610
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:13,320
They're not trying to make you money.

1611
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:15,520
They're trying to make themselves money.

1612
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:17,760
And it's not that they're, does that mean that they're bad?

1613
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:19,240
No, they just, that's their job.

1614
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:20,920
And you just gotta understand that like,

1615
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:22,120
that's their angle.

1616
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:22,960
Yeah.

1617
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:23,960
Yeah, okay, okay.

1618
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:25,280
Okay, got it, thanks.

1619
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:27,000
Yeah, no problem.

1620
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,320
Have a good day, bye.

1621
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:30,840
All right, you too, take care, bye-bye.

1622
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:31,680
All right, cool.

1623
01:21:31,680 --> 01:21:33,480
All right, we've been on for a while.

1624
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:34,920
I'm late to my next meeting.

1625
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:36,800
So talk to you guys later.

1626
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:38,160
Hopefully this was helpful.

1627
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:39,760
All right, have a good week, bye.
