1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,560
How do we do this when we have 40 billion things going on?

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,720
You need to prioritize, bro.

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,000
Kenny, look at all the stuff you gotta do.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,800
Cause I know you got a job, I know you got kids,

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,800
I know you got everything.

6
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,280
What is the one thing that would move the needle

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,120
towards your goal?

8
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,680
First of all, you gotta have your goals, right?

9
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,960
And I know you do.

10
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,840
So you got your goals, and if your goal is 20K,

11
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,680
what's the one thing you could do today

12
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,880
that would get you closer to the goal?

13
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,080
Go get a sale, okay?

14
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,320
Is there something you need to do before

15
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,360
you can go get a sale?

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,800
You gotta hook the business owner, cool.

17
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,000
Go hook the business owner, yes.

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,680
When you have 40 billion things going on,

19
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:37,800
what's the one thing that's gonna get you

20
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,640
closer to the goal?

21
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,600
It's by getting a damn client, okay?

22
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,440
Go get a client.
