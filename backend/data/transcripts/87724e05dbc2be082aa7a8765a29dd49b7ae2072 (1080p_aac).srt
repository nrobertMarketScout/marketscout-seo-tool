1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,360
All right, now that we have created the website, we're just missing the images.

2
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:17,600
So rule of thumb, we get 25 images total for our website that has three service pages and

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,820
that does not include the header photo.

4
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:25,800
So it's 25 plus 126 and the 26 photo is the header image.

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,720
So right here where it looks blue is going to be your header photo.

6
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:37,040
There is usually the best way you can get images is just by asking the business owner

7
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,280
that you landed.

8
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,680
The reason why is because you're going to be the best pictures you can get the most

9
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,220
local, the most like authentic photos for this.

10
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:51,280
It's going to make the website look really local, very authentic instead of getting stock

11
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,280
images.

12
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,080
So that's what we recommend you doing.

13
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:58,160
You do need to remember two rules when you're doing that.

14
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:04,200
Number one is when you're asking the business owner for photos, make sure that they are

15
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,320
not being used on his own website.

16
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,800
A lot of the times when you're pitching and you're selling leads, what happens is the

17
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:16,760
business owner already has a social media account, a Facebook page or their own website.

18
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:24,520
So we do not, and again, we do not want to use photos that are already being used by

19
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:29,840
him or her on their website or social media because that would be copyright.

20
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:36,520
So any photos that he sends you, they need to be fresh or unused on his own platforms.

21
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,360
That being said, that is the first rule.

22
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:44,800
Number two, let's say he has some fresh images or he's going to take pictures for you.

23
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,800
And one thing that I personally do is I just say, Hey, if you don't have photos, next

24
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:53,640
time you do go on the job, just take some on your phone and usually an iPhone camera

25
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,640
will be pretty good.

26
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,200
Take them on your phone and email them to me.

27
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,360
And then the number two rule is make sure that the pictures that are being taken do

28
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,600
not have the company's logo on it.

29
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,600
And just be attention.

30
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:13,160
Like a lot of the time, the concrete contractors will wear a t-shirt that has their company

31
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,280
logo on it or they'll drive a truck that has the company logo on it.

32
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:21,320
So make sure that the pictures that you're taking from the business owner do not have

33
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:28,320
their company name on it because we are targeting this website as Queen Creek concrete.

34
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,360
And if in the future you ever need to switch up the business owner, you don't have to

35
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,760
worry about, Oh, well, it's marketing that company.

36
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:38,200
So those are the two basic rules for images.

37
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:43,400
And then one last thing, let's say you cannot get images from the business owner.

38
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,400
You can.

39
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,760
And we do use stock images.

40
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,160
We like to use the free trials.

41
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:57,280
So for example, just go on Google and type free stock images and we'll have a video on

42
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,360
how to optimize images and get, grab those images.

43
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,080
But right now I'm just showing you very quickly.

44
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,280
We use like stock Adobe, Shutterstock.

45
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,800
They all have free trials that you can use.

46
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,240
So just go ahead and take advantage of those and you're done.
