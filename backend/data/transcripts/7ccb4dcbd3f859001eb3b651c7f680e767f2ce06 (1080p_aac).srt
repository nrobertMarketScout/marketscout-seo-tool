1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,500
The question is, should you keep adding content and how often should you keep adding content?

2
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:16,760
We are not Google so we can't give you like a specific answer on what is, you know, the

3
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:20,920
perfect thing that you can do when you are building your website and when it comes down

4
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:21,920
to content.

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,040
But we can tell you what we are doing that has been working for us.

6
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:30,560
So usually if this is the first website that you are building, you put on the content,

7
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,040
you are doing all the on-pages here, you are setting this up, don't touch it for a couple

8
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,200
of months and then in a couple of months, two, three, four months, do the ranking, see

9
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,760
how your website is doing and then you can add content.

10
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,920
But I would not keep editing, I would not keep touching, just let it do its course,

11
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,800
keep getting other deals, focus on other things and just kind of focus on other things, don't

12
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:01,720
keep adding or editing because Google is crawling your website, is ranking your website

13
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,320
and so you don't want to mess too much with it.

14
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,560
So I would say wait a couple of months, do the rankings after that, see how your website

15
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,560
is doing.

16
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:14,880
If it's not doing great, if it's still on page five, six, seven and you are not seeing

17
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,720
it, you know, getting better, then add some content.

18
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,920
And I would start with adding 500 words per page every week.

19
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:30,200
Do that and then after a month, do the rankings again and see if, and I mean, it doesn't have

20
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:36,000
to be page one, number one, but it should be progressively getting better.

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,240
And again, it's not just about content, you are also going to have to do other things

22
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,840
to rank it if it's not ranking, but content will be something major for your website and

23
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,640
so that's something that you want to do.

24
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,920
You want to be checking it and adding if needed.

25
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,160
If your website is ranking, do not touch it.

26
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,840
That is one of the main rules that we have.

27
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,240
If your website is on page one and it's ranking really well, it's getting leads.

28
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:08,560
Don't think, oh, well, what can it, how much more better it could be doing if I added more

29
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,880
content, if I touch it up or well, it's kind of ugly.

30
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,760
I don't really like the content I'm going to edit.

31
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,760
Don't touch it.

32
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,040
If it's ranking, if it's producing, don't touch it.

33
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,920
Just leave it because it's working.

34
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,780
It has been working and there's no need for you to touch it or mess with it.

35
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:23,780
So leave it.

36
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:30,800
You only go on and add content, edit content if it's not ranking or producing.

37
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,800
And that's it for content.
