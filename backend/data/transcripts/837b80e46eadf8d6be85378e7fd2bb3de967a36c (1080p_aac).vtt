WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:15.440
So let's talk about objections and let's talk about our plan to overcome each of these objections

00:15.440 --> 00:19.560
I want to make one important note before we hop over the screen and that is you only need

00:19.560 --> 00:22.720
to create this once I am going to give you a cheat sheet but I'm going to I'm going

00:22.720 --> 00:28.920
to ask you or I'm going to invite you to make some tweaks and do things you know the way

00:28.960 --> 00:32.480
that it makes sense to you so if there's a way that I overcome an objection that just

00:32.480 --> 00:36.800
doesn't feel right doesn't sound right doesn't really vibe with you feel free to change it

00:36.800 --> 00:41.320
the cool part is just like the keyword list you only have to build this once and then it's just

00:41.320 --> 00:48.000
a matter of slowly refining this process okay and what I mean by this process is these objections

00:48.000 --> 00:52.240
and the way that we're gonna overcome them okay so let's hop over to the cheat sheet guys welcome

00:52.240 --> 00:59.380
to FFM 2.0 objections cheat sheet so what I've got here is I've listed out the most common

00:59.380 --> 01:04.800
objections and then I've listed out the way that I overcome each of these objections which again

01:04.800 --> 01:10.000
I want to invite you guys you're free to make some slight tweaks to the ones that don't really

01:10.000 --> 01:14.840
make sense don't jam with you don't vibe with you don't whatever with you don't sit well with you

01:14.840 --> 01:18.320
that's fine this is just what I do okay so I'm gonna go through these really quick the most

01:18.320 --> 01:22.920
common objections are these are the following okay number one I need to talk to my partner and

01:22.920 --> 01:27.720
this aren't in order by the way this is just the list I need to talk to my partner number two I

01:27.720 --> 01:33.320
want to do a commission or paperly deal basically the deal structure right number three you know

01:33.320 --> 01:39.800
price this is too expensive number four is trust and trust they're not gonna come out say I don't

01:39.800 --> 01:45.360
trust you it's gonna be like hey can I talk to some customers can I see your website can I look

01:45.360 --> 01:50.200
at some reviews can this one is hard because they're not gonna come out and say hey I don't

01:50.200 --> 01:55.040
trust you okay most people won't say that or they're gonna say how do I know it's gonna work

01:55.040 --> 02:05.600
right five I want to think about it and six I don't do contracts okay so let me talk about really

02:05.600 --> 02:09.920
quick we're gonna go into all these number one I need to talk to my spouse slash partner how do

02:09.920 --> 02:16.320
I overcome this preemptively offensively and I've listed here really simply when setting up zoom

02:16.320 --> 02:22.240
call make sure all decision makers can make that time and stress on the value of both of your time

02:22.240 --> 02:26.040
so I just let them know I'm like hey is it just you that owns the business like you could be a

02:26.040 --> 02:30.440
little tactful here hey it's just you do you have a partner okay cool make sure they're on the call

02:30.440 --> 02:34.360
tomorrow because I don't want to play telephone and have you having to talk to them and the whole

02:34.360 --> 02:39.600
thing so make sure if you have a partner they're on tomorrow that's it very simple because that's

02:39.600 --> 02:44.440
the only way to overcome it is make sure that all decision makers are present on that call okay or

02:44.440 --> 02:50.080
if they say yeah that person you know my partner is out of the country or whatever say oh okay so

02:50.080 --> 02:54.320
just to confirm just to respect both of our time if we talk tomorrow and we can work something out

02:54.320 --> 02:57.640
you're not gonna be one of those guys like I gotta go talk to my partner right like you can make a

02:57.640 --> 03:02.200
decision because if not let's push the call a little bit okay just be candid with them say that

03:02.200 --> 03:08.160
up front okay number two I want to you know I'm just saying the objection I want to do a

03:08.160 --> 03:12.760
commission or paper lead deal you're gonna have a lot of people that say hey I don't want to do a

03:12.760 --> 03:18.000
flat fee deal or you know I'd like to just do a commission where I just add a little extra and I

03:18.000 --> 03:22.680
pay you a percentage or I'll pay you ten percent Nick I'll pay you ten percent on what I close

03:22.680 --> 03:28.800
right tons of people are gonna say this and we're gonna overcome this very simply during the pre

03:28.800 --> 03:35.400
closed screencast and we're gonna be talking about that very soon in the next couple lessons I

03:35.400 --> 03:41.520
explained that with commission there's no skin in the game and I explained that it's not profitable

03:41.520 --> 03:46.800
for either party to do commission or paper lead and I have a story for each of those and we're

03:46.800 --> 03:52.040
gonna get into that but basically in the pre-closed screencast I let them know that it is not a good

03:52.040 --> 03:56.080
use of anyone's time and I give examples okay and it never comes up by the way I never have people

03:56.080 --> 04:01.760
asking they're never hey can you do this or hey can you this because there's a couple reasons why

04:01.760 --> 04:07.640
that's number one the other reason and the other way that I overcome this is if you send people

04:07.640 --> 04:13.680
good quality leads in the setup during the Costco sample strategy phase they're not gonna be as

04:13.680 --> 04:17.080
worried the reason people want to do commission or paper lead is because they're worried they're

04:17.080 --> 04:21.760
not gonna get leads or that the leads are gonna suck okay so part of it is actually getting them

04:22.240 --> 04:27.680
next objection that you might get or you will get at some point is it's too expensive they're

04:27.680 --> 04:30.720
not gonna come out probably and say it's too expensive because they're too prideful but they're

04:30.720 --> 04:36.240
gonna say hey I just can't justify that blah blah blah blah so the way I over I overcome this is I

04:36.240 --> 04:41.160
again I give them quality leads during the Costco sample stage just like I told you in the commission

04:41.160 --> 04:46.480
slash paper lead how to overcome that but I properly during the pre-closed screencast and even

04:46.480 --> 04:51.400
sometimes on the close I make sure to show them the lead value calculator and show them just how

04:51.400 --> 04:55.320
valuable these leads are worth and one of the biggest things that I've heard over and over and

04:55.320 --> 04:59.680
over from students that have gone through this program already is that they didn't know what

04:59.680 --> 05:04.120
their leads were worth they didn't value their leads enough and when you value your leads and

05:04.120 --> 05:08.200
you have a lead value calculator to show them hey look at how much this is worth if you get even

05:08.200 --> 05:13.680
12 leads with these concrete leads you're gonna make this much money okay and when you show them

05:13.680 --> 05:19.280
this and this isn't a lie and you don't want to oversell but when you do this properly their mind

05:19.840 --> 05:24.360
is blown I never ever ever get this objection because I explain how valuable these leads are

05:24.360 --> 05:29.480
during the pre-closed screencast during showing the lead value calculator and by the quality of

05:29.480 --> 05:33.840
the leads that I send during the Costco sample strategy which is also part of the setup okay

05:33.840 --> 05:40.600
number four is trust this is again this is a really difficult it's like a touch-and-go a feel one this

05:40.600 --> 05:45.800
one's harder they're not gonna come and say I don't trust you okay they're typically gonna say hey do

05:45.800 --> 05:51.920
you have any reviews do you have any case studies do you have any people I can talk to can I see

05:51.920 --> 05:56.680
your website how long have you guys been in bit like all these things mean they don't trust you

05:56.680 --> 06:02.880
okay and so here's what I do is and I put again same as above with the samples okay which is the

06:02.880 --> 06:07.680
leads that we send this is why sending these leads up front and good quality leads is so freaking

06:07.680 --> 06:12.160
valuable because it overcomes so many objections the biggest one we talked about this during the

06:13.160 --> 06:18.640
the biggest one that actually overcomes is the objection of trust and that's why because it's

06:18.640 --> 06:25.200
so hard to overcome and I also noted here also during the pre-closed screencast show ample case

06:25.200 --> 06:28.840
studies and social proof and for those of you that are like I don't have any cases I don't have any

06:28.840 --> 06:34.520
samples or I don't have any social proof great leverage other people in the group and their

06:34.520 --> 06:38.920
projects until you have your own no no issue with that and I will let you leverage mine if you'd

06:38.920 --> 06:44.520
like as well number five I want to think about it okay here's how I do it I always let them know

06:44.520 --> 06:49.680
the morning of or the night before I just let them know as I call them and say hey are we good for

06:49.680 --> 06:54.480
XYZ time okay cool and this is me talking like you're the business owner okay cool sounds good

06:54.480 --> 06:58.280
the reason I ask I have a let's say the calls at two by the way I say the reason I ask I have a

06:58.280 --> 07:02.200
call at four with another company and I'll even make sure that that company is someone I've talked

07:02.200 --> 07:06.560
to you I have a call at four or I have a call later this afternoon I just want to make sure

07:06.560 --> 07:11.440
it's not gonna conflict I plan on canceling that as long as and assuming we can work something out

07:11.440 --> 07:14.480
but I just want to make sure there's no conflict okay and what you're doing there is you're

07:14.480 --> 07:19.160
planning that seed like okay first of all this guy this lady she has options he has options okay

07:19.160 --> 07:23.480
number one number two is when they go I'm gonna get back to you on Monday I'm gonna get back to

07:23.480 --> 07:28.120
you on Friday it's like no I told you I have a call later this afternoon and I told you I only

07:28.120 --> 07:34.760
work exclusively with one company so you can wait until you know next year for all I care but if I

07:34.760 --> 07:41.060
find somebody that's ready to rock and roll I'm working with them so shit or get off the pop man

07:41.060 --> 07:47.320
we doing this or not okay last one I don't do contracts which I think is so ironic and I love

07:47.320 --> 07:54.000
I don't say I don't do this because I preemptively want to teach you guys to bring this up but when

07:54.000 --> 07:59.320
I used to post emptily and I when they taught me to wait for the you know the objection I used

07:59.320 --> 08:02.480
to love burning them when they would say I don't do contracts I'm like oh that's interesting I'm

08:02.480 --> 08:08.960
like that that phone you have in your hand um I guess and you just paid cash for that right it's

08:08.960 --> 08:13.640
like what thousand bucks like no well no I'm on like a plan oh okay okay interesting well that's

08:13.640 --> 08:19.600
a that's a contract that's a two-year contract and then they'd say or I'd say hey well this

08:19.600 --> 08:25.120
house did you pay cash no no I guess it's like no listen man listen lady you do contracts you

08:25.120 --> 08:31.040
got a cell phone you got a house you got a car you do contracts that's part of life okay all right

08:31.440 --> 08:36.640
like it was like very aggressive but anyway just a quick side note here's how I preemptively

08:36.640 --> 08:41.720
overcome it okay during the zoom close I remind them that since this is exclusive I'm gonna need

08:41.720 --> 08:46.200
a commitment or you're you're gonna need a commitment from them just like you're making to

08:46.200 --> 08:51.400
them okay and you want to frame it as a good thing as a protection against the price going up but

08:51.400 --> 08:56.160
listen think about it this way you are being married to them essentially you're being married

08:56.160 --> 08:59.720
to them you don't have the ability to go and look for other companies right because you are

08:59.760 --> 09:04.840
married to them you are exclusive with them so how does it make sense that I'm exclusive to you

09:04.840 --> 09:09.080
I'm committed to you I can't talk to any other companies or send them any other leads but you

09:09.080 --> 09:13.080
get a walk away whenever that's like being married to someone and they can go do whatever the hell

09:13.080 --> 09:18.360
they want but you are stuck and you can't do anything okay doesn't make any sense okay so for

09:18.360 --> 09:23.060
me to be exclusive to you I need you to give me give me a fair shake and we got to do this for six

09:23.060 --> 09:27.560
months the other reason and I'll say this as well is we're gonna have just to be candid we're gonna

09:27.560 --> 09:31.160
have some slow months we're gonna have some really hot months and we're gonna take the average of

09:31.160 --> 09:36.520
these six months and this is going to be a net net profitable win-win but I don't want you after

09:36.520 --> 09:40.360
one month we have a slow month because of the weather because of this or because it takes a

09:40.360 --> 09:44.600
while to get warm this year and you all of a sudden just think this sucks I want you to give

09:44.600 --> 09:48.200
this a fair shake so we can see what it's like during some of the slower months and some of the

09:48.200 --> 09:51.960
warmer months because I want to work together for 10 years I'm not looking at this for you know a

09:51.960 --> 09:57.160
couple months so we've got to do a six month deal to start and then after that we can go from there

09:57.320 --> 10:03.560
okay so guys these are the objections these are the objections you're going to get and these are

10:03.560 --> 10:09.080
the ways that I preemptively these are the ways I personally preemptively overcome them one last

10:09.080 --> 10:14.680
thing I want to note is any objection that you keep getting over and over and over just use this

10:14.680 --> 10:20.680
same exact model meaning just bring it up first bring it up first I got to give some love to some

10:20.680 --> 10:26.440
people in our group that actually taught me this and pointed out that we can just do this for any

10:26.440 --> 10:31.400
objection and so one of the students that's in this group they mentioned that they kept getting

10:31.400 --> 10:35.720
the same objection over and over which was they would get on the call and the business owner kept

10:35.720 --> 10:41.640
saying well I haven't closed any you know leads I haven't closed any of these yet okay and I don't

10:41.640 --> 10:45.000
ever get that so I know it's probably something in the way that they were doing the hook or

10:45.000 --> 10:51.240
something that they were saying however they kept getting it and so this individual she realized

10:51.240 --> 10:54.040
I'm just going to bring this up first so immediately when they hopped on the call

10:54.920 --> 10:59.640
she would say hey so I know you got those leads and by the way just so you know I understand like

10:59.640 --> 11:04.760
you probably haven't even closed any that's pretty typical I mean I only sent you a couple the purpose

11:04.760 --> 11:08.520
wasn't to have you close a deal the purpose was to send you a couple to try them out and if you

11:08.520 --> 11:12.520
close one great but we understand like it's a numbers game right just something very very

11:12.520 --> 11:16.600
simple like that instead of waiting for the customer to say hey I didn't close any I'm not

11:16.600 --> 11:21.640
doing this she went after it she went after the objection never an objection again so if you guys

11:21.640 --> 11:27.480
have any objections keep getting over and over and over guess what well put it on your cheat sheet

11:27.480 --> 11:32.040
and bring it up some at some point whether it's during the phone call when your life transfer

11:32.040 --> 11:35.800
leads whether it's during the pre-closed screencast or whether it's right at the beginning

11:35.800 --> 11:40.600
of the close bring up the objection first and it will become a non-objection
