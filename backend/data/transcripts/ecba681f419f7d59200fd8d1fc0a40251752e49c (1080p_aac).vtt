00:00.000 --> 00:12.380
All right, let's talk about the deal.

00:12.380 --> 00:16.860
Let's talk about step three of the perfect prospecting script, which is explaining the

00:16.860 --> 00:17.860
deal.

00:17.860 --> 00:19.220
What is in it for them and what is in it for you?

00:19.220 --> 00:24.260
And as I've talked about already, the more important part of this equation, which is

00:24.260 --> 00:29.020
what's in it for the business owner and what's in it for you, it's way more, although it

00:29.020 --> 00:33.780
sounds counterintuitive, it's way more important for you to explain to them clearly what's

00:33.780 --> 00:37.580
in it for you than what's in it for them, because they already know what's in it for

00:37.580 --> 00:38.580
them.

00:38.580 --> 00:39.580
Okay.

00:39.580 --> 00:42.780
They're already expecting you to shower them with reasons why it's a good deal for them.

00:42.780 --> 00:49.820
But very, very few people, in fact, no one explains what's in it for the person calling.

00:49.820 --> 00:53.100
So for example, home advisor, all they do is they call and they say, hey, you're going

00:53.100 --> 00:54.820
to get, I'm going to give you leads, blah, blah, blah.

00:54.820 --> 00:58.340
They don't turn around and say, hey, the reason that we're doing this is because we make a

00:58.340 --> 01:01.140
shitload of money off of selling leads.

01:01.140 --> 01:02.140
Okay.

01:02.140 --> 01:03.140
Because guess what?

01:03.140 --> 01:06.060
If they did that, they'd sell a whole lot more leads if they just said that.

01:06.060 --> 01:08.780
But instead it's always like, oh no, we're just such good people.

01:08.780 --> 01:11.840
And guys, that's the same reason you guys have been on calls with me.

01:11.840 --> 01:14.740
That's the same reason why I tell you, hey, I'm going to take care of you.

01:14.740 --> 01:15.940
I am going to over deliver.

01:15.940 --> 01:18.700
I know you're expecting me to say that, but guess what?

01:18.700 --> 01:19.860
Here's what's in it for me.

01:19.860 --> 01:25.920
If I over deliver, I am going to grow this group and I am going to make a lot of money.

01:25.920 --> 01:27.580
And I have no shame in talking about it.

01:27.580 --> 01:29.620
I got no bones saying that.

01:29.620 --> 01:30.620
Okay.

01:30.620 --> 01:32.820
And when I say that, you respect it.

01:32.820 --> 01:34.620
You're like, okay, that's what I thought anyway.

01:34.620 --> 01:36.180
I'm glad he owns it.

01:36.180 --> 01:37.180
Okay.

01:37.180 --> 01:38.380
So I just wanted to point that out.

01:38.380 --> 01:42.380
Do not be shy telling them, hey, this is what's in it for me.

01:42.380 --> 01:43.380
Okay.

01:43.380 --> 01:44.620
This do not, do not be shy.

01:44.620 --> 01:46.280
Do not feel like you need to lie.

01:46.280 --> 01:47.860
Do not feel like you need to hide.

01:47.860 --> 01:51.180
Do not feel like you need to pretend to be a good person or that you're just helping

01:51.180 --> 01:52.180
out.

01:52.180 --> 01:53.180
I like to help local business owners.

01:53.180 --> 01:54.180
Bullshit.

01:54.180 --> 01:55.180
Okay.

01:55.180 --> 01:56.180
Bullshit.

01:56.180 --> 01:57.180
You're here to make money.

01:57.780 --> 01:58.780
They don't know.

01:58.780 --> 01:59.780
They already know you're going to do that.

01:59.780 --> 02:00.780
Okay.

02:00.780 --> 02:01.780
I just want to point that out.

02:01.780 --> 02:02.780
Let's dive in.

02:02.780 --> 02:05.700
So guys, going back a little bit, the last thing that we did before we transitioned is

02:05.700 --> 02:10.860
we explained, Mr. Business Owner, Jack, the reason I called you is because I saw you're

02:10.860 --> 02:13.160
running paid ads on Google.

02:13.160 --> 02:15.620
So I know you're hungry to grow.

02:15.620 --> 02:17.540
Now we transition and we're going to transition.

02:17.540 --> 02:21.100
The first thing we're going to do is we're going to tell them that we have a hot lead

02:21.100 --> 02:25.300
for them and that we want to give them a couple leads in exchange for a conversation.

02:25.300 --> 02:26.840
Okay.

02:27.500 --> 02:28.960
Yeah.

02:28.960 --> 02:32.800
So Jack, I'm merging these a little bit, but we get done.

02:32.800 --> 02:35.480
Hey, the reason I'm calling you is because you're running ads.

02:35.480 --> 02:38.600
So here's the deal is the reason I'm calling you, you know how I mentioned Silver Beach

02:38.600 --> 02:39.600
Circle?

02:39.600 --> 02:40.600
Yeah.

02:40.600 --> 02:41.600
I have a lady.

02:41.600 --> 02:42.600
Her name is Janet.

02:42.600 --> 02:43.600
She needs a tree removed.

02:43.600 --> 02:44.600
This just actually came through my website.

02:44.600 --> 02:45.640
That's why I was calling you.

02:45.640 --> 02:47.400
I want to give you this job.

02:47.400 --> 02:48.400
Literally.

02:48.400 --> 02:49.400
It costs you nothing.

02:49.400 --> 02:50.400
I'm going to do it.

02:50.400 --> 02:52.120
I don't care if you don't even return my call.

02:52.120 --> 02:53.120
Okay.

02:53.120 --> 02:54.780
However, I do want to mention this.

02:54.780 --> 02:59.460
What I would like to do and the reason I called you specifically is I am looking for an ongoing

02:59.460 --> 03:00.460
partner.

03:00.460 --> 03:01.460
Okay.

03:01.460 --> 03:02.460
Make no mistake about it.

03:02.460 --> 03:06.080
I would like to give you this one, but I'd also like to give you about three to five

03:06.080 --> 03:08.700
of these to just test out.

03:08.700 --> 03:12.040
All I would ask in return, and the reason I'd be willing to do that is I would love

03:12.040 --> 03:16.380
to talk about possibly working together in a couple of days or maybe a week, whenever

03:16.380 --> 03:17.960
I can get you a couple of jobs.

03:17.960 --> 03:18.960
Would you be open to that?

03:18.960 --> 03:22.900
If I could just give you a couple for no charge and then we talk in a couple of days.

03:22.900 --> 03:23.900
Okay.

03:24.020 --> 03:25.720
Guys, that's all you got to say.

03:25.720 --> 03:27.160
That's the whole step.

03:27.160 --> 03:28.520
That's the deal.

03:28.520 --> 03:29.520
You're going to get a couple of jobs.

03:29.520 --> 03:30.940
First of all, I have a hot lead.

03:30.940 --> 03:34.540
That's why I'm calling you, just to follow up from last step.

03:34.540 --> 03:35.540
Okay.

03:35.540 --> 03:38.760
And I would like to give you three to five for free.

03:38.760 --> 03:40.420
That's what's in it for you.

03:40.420 --> 03:42.620
What's in it for me is I want a conversation.

03:42.620 --> 03:44.080
Are you good if we have a conversation?

03:44.080 --> 03:45.080
Because here's the deal.

03:45.080 --> 03:46.080
You're already spending money.

03:46.080 --> 03:47.080
You're hungry to grow.

03:47.080 --> 03:48.680
I have jobs.

03:48.680 --> 03:49.880
I don't do the work.

03:49.880 --> 03:52.780
You do the work and you need more jobs or you wouldn't be running ads.

03:52.780 --> 03:56.700
So what if I get you a couple for free to prove that I'm not messing around and we talk

03:56.700 --> 03:58.020
in a couple of days?

03:58.020 --> 03:59.020
Okay.

03:59.020 --> 04:00.020
No obligation, no commitment.

04:00.020 --> 04:03.860
The only thing I ask in return is that you talk, is that we have a discussion.

04:03.860 --> 04:04.860
That's it.

04:04.860 --> 04:05.860
Are you good with that?

04:05.860 --> 04:06.860
Cool.

04:06.860 --> 04:07.860
And guys, that's it.

04:07.860 --> 04:08.860
That is it.

04:08.860 --> 04:10.860
And I don't even want to go any further.

04:10.860 --> 04:15.060
Some other things that you can sprinkle in is I do at times, if I'm feeling a little

04:15.060 --> 04:21.560
shaky or I'm a little bit more comfortable, I do like to sprinkle in, I like to name drop.

04:21.560 --> 04:23.320
So let's say I'm targeting St. George.

04:23.320 --> 04:26.120
So at this point, I would be like, maybe they'd say, yeah, I'm down.

04:26.120 --> 04:27.120
I'm cool.

04:27.120 --> 04:29.860
Cause like guys, that's a really, it's a, it's a, it's a no lose.

04:29.860 --> 04:31.960
There's no risk for them, right?

04:31.960 --> 04:35.880
The only risk is if you start saying, oh, it's good, good, good, and you don't explain

04:35.880 --> 04:39.240
what's in it for you, they're going to say, yeah, I'm good because they just think it's

04:39.240 --> 04:40.240
a scam.

04:40.240 --> 04:41.240
Okay.

04:41.240 --> 04:42.520
That's going to translate the scam.

04:42.520 --> 04:46.560
They think it's a scam is going to translate into I'm good or I've got plenty of work.

04:46.560 --> 04:48.760
They're really actually interested because they're running ads.

04:48.760 --> 04:49.760
They just don't understand.

04:49.760 --> 04:50.760
Okay.

04:50.960 --> 04:55.480
At this point, if I'm feeling a little shaky, what I'll say is, Hey, do you guys know the,

04:55.480 --> 04:58.080
you know, XYZ company down the road?

04:58.080 --> 04:59.200
It's totally different.

04:59.200 --> 05:03.000
These guys actually do, they do, they do tree service.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
You guys know them?

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
Yeah.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
So yeah.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
Tony's a great guy.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
Michelle's awesome.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
Yeah.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.200
I've been working with those guys for two years doing the exact same thing.

05:11.200 --> 05:12.440
I just send them the jobs.

05:12.440 --> 05:17.240
We have a deal worked out where we, you know, I win, they win, I get paid, they get paid.

05:17.240 --> 05:18.240
It's worked out super nice.

05:18.240 --> 05:19.920
So anyway, so I'll do that.

05:20.080 --> 05:23.400
So if it's somebody in their town, if I'm already working with somebody in St. George

05:23.400 --> 05:27.760
or in Austin or whatever, I'll use, even if it's a different industry, I'll use somebody.

05:27.760 --> 05:30.800
If it's somebody in the industry, I'll just drop the name.

05:30.800 --> 05:36.040
So let's say I'm going, I'm in St. George and I'm targeting a company in Vegas or I'm

05:36.040 --> 05:38.920
targeting company in Vegas, but I have somebody in St. George in Vegas.

05:38.920 --> 05:41.960
I'd say, Hey, I know this is a little bit of a stretch, but you don't happen to know

05:41.960 --> 05:45.760
that company up in St. George, a couple hours wait, it's called Provent.

05:45.760 --> 05:48.160
I know that they've like done a few jobs down there.

05:48.160 --> 05:49.160
Have you bumped into them?

05:49.160 --> 05:50.160
Okay, cool.

05:50.160 --> 05:51.480
Anyway, the guy's name is Joe.

05:51.480 --> 05:55.880
I've been working with him doing something similar, not in your market, but in St. George

05:55.880 --> 05:56.880
for about two years.

05:56.880 --> 05:58.000
It's been awesome, man.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.160
We've been working together forever.

05:59.160 --> 06:03.760
So anyway, beside the point, and that's just a way of me building credibility.

06:03.760 --> 06:05.680
Okay, guys, that's it.

06:05.680 --> 06:06.680
That's the deal.

06:06.680 --> 06:10.400
Again, most important part about explaining the deal is first of all, don't overthink

06:10.400 --> 06:11.400
it.

06:11.400 --> 06:12.400
Just explain.

06:12.400 --> 06:13.400
I'm going to give you a couple of leads.

06:13.400 --> 06:14.400
First of all, I got Janet.

06:14.400 --> 06:15.400
She's hot, baby.

06:15.400 --> 06:16.400
She's ready to roll.

06:16.400 --> 06:17.400
Number one, you're going to explain that.

06:17.640 --> 06:20.640
You're going to say, let me give you a couple for free.

06:20.640 --> 06:24.320
Like literally, the only thing I ask in return is I want to have a conversation.

06:24.320 --> 06:25.320
That's it.

06:25.320 --> 06:28.920
I want to have a conversation about possibly working together.

06:28.920 --> 06:29.920
That's it.

06:29.920 --> 06:30.920
Explain it.

06:30.920 --> 06:33.600
Then again, we're going to transition after this point if they've agreed and said, yeah,

06:33.600 --> 06:34.600
that sounds good.

06:34.600 --> 06:35.600
I'm okay with that.

06:35.600 --> 06:36.920
Say, oh, awesome.

06:36.920 --> 06:40.660
What's the best email and phone number to send these leads to?

06:40.660 --> 06:42.440
I'm just going to go right into it.

06:42.440 --> 06:46.840
What's the best email and phone number to send these leads to?

06:47.280 --> 06:50.600
Because if you ask that question and they're not following you, they ain't going to give

06:50.600 --> 06:51.600
you the email.

06:51.600 --> 06:52.600
They're not going to give you the phone number.

06:52.600 --> 06:53.600
Okay?

06:53.600 --> 06:54.600
That's where I'm going to leave this video.

06:54.600 --> 06:55.100
I'll see you on the next one.
