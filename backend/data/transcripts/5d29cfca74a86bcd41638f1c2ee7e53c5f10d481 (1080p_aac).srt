1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,880
What is SEO and why do we do it?

2
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:13,760
So I'm gonna go very basic here and some of you that are experts and have been doing this

3
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:18,200
for a long time, just bear with me, I'm all about the fundamentals because fundamentals

4
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,600
wins basketball games, ask John Wooden.

5
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:27,480
Okay, so SEO, I know this is very basic but S stands for search, E stands for engine,

6
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,880
O stands for optimization, search engine optimization.

7
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:36,280
In layman terms, it is taking a website and getting it to the top of Google.

8
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,280
Okay, that's it.

9
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:43,080
Very, very simple and there are certain things that we have seen and tested and proven, at

10
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,520
least in theory, that they will get you to the top of Google and I say that at least

11
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,880
in theory because nobody really knows the answers.

12
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,640
This is Google that's messing with us.

13
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:57,440
Google basically gives these little breadcrumbs and says, hey, this is what we say helps but

14
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,380
we don't actually know if that's true and it's just a big giant game for them but here

15
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:07,520
we are, we're playing the game because this traffic that will come from SEO is worth gold.

16
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:16,200
So this is the part where we are going to turn a deal into an asset and I'll tell you

17
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,640
right now if you're watching this video and you're like, hey, I don't really care about

18
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,320
the assets, I just want to have my deal at 1000 bucks or my deal at 1500, I'm gonna spend

19
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:28,720
the $300 or $400 or $600 on ads, I'm gonna make the difference, cool, shut this part

20
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,200
down and keep doing deals.

21
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,680
However, I would highly recommend you continue these modules, you continue watching, you

22
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,800
continue learning, you continue growing because if we can nail this part, this is where we

23
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:45,920
can get the website to rank at the top of Google and when a website ranks at the top

24
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,680
of Google, we start getting what's called organic traffic.

25
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,800
That is traffic where people will search for Concrete Queen Creek using our example and

26
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:00,680
they will look and find our website without us having to pay for ads, they will call us

27
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:05,840
without us having to pay for ads and therefore that traffic is essentially free, those are

28
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:11,320
free leads for us so it costs us $0 to acquire and then we can turn around and be charging

29
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,240
that same 1000, 2000.

30
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,680
So the game is very simple.

31
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,440
We're going to use SEO, we're gonna build up the website, we're gonna use SEO and we're

32
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:27,600
gonna rank it at the top of Google and as the organic calls start to come in, it's gonna

33
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:33,840
allow us to shut down the ads little by little and our organic continues to increase and

34
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,200
there's gonna be this shift so every time we decrease our ads by $10, we make an extra

35
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,200
$10 because our price stays the same.

36
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,600
We make $100 so we're doing this, okay?

37
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,640
I highly, highly, highly recommend doing this part of the process.

38
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:56,000
This is the final piece because this is where we go from a deal to an asset.

39
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,480
One of the other benefits of doing SEO, of getting your website ranked is it solidifies

40
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,500
the deal and it mitigates our risk.

41
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:11,380
What I mean by that is if we only have leads coming in from ads, we run the risk of Google

42
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:15,100
messing with the ads and us being affected.

43
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:21,580
But if we have leads coming in from SEO and the ads, if Google messes with the ads, well

44
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,380
we still have the SEO leads, right?

45
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,500
We still have the organic leads.

46
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:32,020
So doing this is going to solidify the deal and mitigate our risk.

47
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:37,940
What I've seen in my experience is the leads that come in from SEO, the organic leads,

48
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,940
meaning leads that weren't paid for by ads.

49
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:44,980
I don't know if this is actual fact, this is just my gut telling me, but it seems like

50
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,140
they're usually a little higher quality.

51
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:51,620
I don't know if it's because the buyer, the person that's searching for that service is

52
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:56,140
a little bit more savvy and they see the ads and they go, hey, you know, that's an ad which

53
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:59,580
means that that company paid to be there, I'm gonna go and look for the organic.

54
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,120
I don't know.

55
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:06,080
But pound for pound I have seen that the leads that come from organic seem to be a little

56
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,160
higher quality and by higher quality I mean they convert a little bit better.

57
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:14,360
Again, this is just a gut thing, but I really, really like the organic leads.

58
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:20,960
Even though we don't necessarily need them, they're super, super nice to have because

59
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:26,000
again they mitigate our risk and they just allow us to sleep better at night.

60
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,520
So guys, with that said, let's keep going.
