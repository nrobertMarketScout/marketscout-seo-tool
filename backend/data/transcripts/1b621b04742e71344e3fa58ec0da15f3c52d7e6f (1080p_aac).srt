1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,120
All right, let's build a killer keyword list. Now, what does that mean? Why are we doing

2
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:19,440
this so early? I'm going to go over all of those things, but first of all, I want to

3
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:24,560
cover why we are taking the time at this stage of the game. All we've done at this point

4
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,240
is pick the niche, and if you haven't picked the niche, you pick a niche, and if you don't

5
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:32,680
know what to pick, pick concrete, okay, just to recap from our last lesson. But we've picked

6
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,760
the niche, you're like, why are we already doing the keyword list? Okay, so there's many

7
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:42,160
reasons to this, and I'm going to go over a couple of them, but guys, it's very, very,

8
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,800
very crucial that you stop what you're doing and you do this step. Don't just watch this

9
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:53,960
module, or sorry, don't just watch this lesson, watch this lesson and do what I'm asking,

10
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:58,840
okay? All right, so why does this matter? Why does it matter to have our keyword list

11
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:03,680
dialed in? And what I mean by that is these are the keywords that we're going to be targeting

12
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:09,600
for our SEO, for our ads, for everything within that niche. So let's just assume that we're

13
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,800
doing concrete, because I've said if you don't know what to do, you're going to do concrete.

14
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:18,880
So the number one thing, the first thing that I think you need to understand is that in

15
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,880
order for us to run ads, which is going to be part of this game, now for some of you

16
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,840
that already have sites that are producing leads, this process works just the same and

17
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,920
you're going to use your leads that are already coming in organically, that's fine. But for

18
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,640
everybody else that wants to pre-sell and is just starting, and this niche is starting

19
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,200
from scratch, you are going to need to run ads, okay? That's how we're going to speed

20
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,440
this deal up. And as such, we're going to have to set up keyword themes, or we're going

21
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:52,720
to have to pick our keyword inside of our ads. So what keywords do we pick? Well, if

22
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:58,640
we do the keyword list correctly from the beginning, that becomes very simple, okay?

23
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,840
Also, what kind of ad copy do we want to include? Well, we're going to want to include some

24
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,960
keywords into our ad copy. So, you know, it's very, very crucial. The second thing, so number

25
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:14,120
one is we're going to need these keywords for the ads. Number two, remember that the

26
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,200
long-term game here, unless you're somebody who's just going to come in and, you know,

27
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,800
sell, and by the way, you could do this, but if you're somebody that's going to come in

28
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,480
and sell a deal for a thousand bucks a month, run $500 in ads and just take the difference

29
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:30,280
and never build out a website, that's totally fine. But I completely, completely, completely

30
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,840
recommend that once you do that and you get the deal, you then take the money from the

31
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,600
deal and build out the actual website. And when you build out the actual website, you're

32
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,120
going to need to know what kind of content to write. And you're going to want to look

33
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,480
at your keywords for that. And you're going to want to know what H1 tags, and we're going

34
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,960
to, by the way, if you have questions on this, we're going to get into that. It's fine. But

35
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,840
if you want to know what type of, you know, heading to use, you want to know what to put

36
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,280
as your page title and your meta description and what to name your images, it all ties

37
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:07,280
back to the keyword list. Okay. So it's super, super, super crucial that you spend the time

38
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,920
to do this correctly. Also, guys, one thing that I made a huge mistake, and you've heard

39
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,960
me talk about having to get rid of 125 sites. One of the things I made a huge mistake with

40
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,040
is when I was doing my due diligence, my market research, whatever you want to call it, I

41
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:26,240
used to just use one keyword. So if I was doing concrete, I would go type in concrete

42
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:31,640
Orlando Florida, and I would look at the metrics and I would base it on one keyword. Okay.

43
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:38,640
And guys, if you base a decision on one keyword, you are rolling the dice, man. It's like going

44
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:43,320
and buying a piece of real estate and literally basing it off of one thing, basing it off

45
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:48,160
what the rents are. That's like, okay, well, the rents are 2000 bucks a month. Great.

46
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,920
That's not looking at how much capital expenditure you're going to need into the roof. It's not

47
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:57,000
looking at HOA fees. It's not looking at, you know, is that a desirable area? Is the

48
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,160
area growing? It's like looking at one factor of a real estate deal and putting money down.

49
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:07,000
That's the same as using one keyword to analyze a deal. Okay. So I did this incorrectly and

50
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,480
I didn't know what I was doing. So we're going to take this keyword list and we are going

51
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:16,280
to use at least five of the keywords that we, that we derive from this keyword list

52
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:21,760
to analyze the deal. So you need to make sure this is done correctly. Okay. I'm telling

53
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:26,480
you, this is so, so important. I've done this the wrong way and it is a nightmare.

54
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:30,440
All right, guys, the cool part about this too is you only have to do this once per niche.

55
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,560
So if you're going to do concrete, you do this correctly. You do it once. Now, if you

56
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,040
build five, 10, 15 more concrete sites, you don't have to keep doing it over and over

57
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,600
you just need to build a keyword list once. Okay. And what I'm going to do is I'm going

58
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:49,840
to show you guys an example of what happens when you don't do this correctly. You don't

59
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,160
look at the keyword research. You don't analyze the competition correctly because you only

60
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,440
look at one keyword. And I'm going to show you what happens. All right, guys. So I went

61
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,720
into this niche called foundation repair and I will tell you right now, this is one of

62
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,520
those niches that is very high ticket. I thought it was going to be a home run. It ended up

63
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,480
being, oh my gosh, I don't even want to get into, I spent a lot of money thinking I was

64
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,760
going to just crush it in this niche. But that's neither here nor there. What I wanted

65
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:21,760
to show you is this site has been live for, I kid you not, multiple years. We've been

66
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:26,640
running SEO on this site and it hasn't been done perfectly. But typically based on the

67
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:32,640
way that I now teach it and the way that I now pick cities and niches, even without doing

68
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:36,400
much, I would be ranking or I would at least be close to ranking. And I'm showing you right

69
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:42,360
now at the time of recording, this site has been live for at least three years. At least

70
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:49,360
three years. And for the main term, I am literally sitting on page five. I am literally sitting

71
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:53,280
on page five. In fact, this is a website that's on my list. I need to just cut this website.

72
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:58,240
This is not going anywhere. It's not doing anything. So if nothing else, guys, this should

73
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:04,280
be a great example of why you have got to make sure to do this keyword list correctly

74
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:08,000
so that you don't make these mistakes. All right. So guys, how do we actually build the

75
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,120
keyword list? So what I would recommend is I like to either get a piece of paper, pull

76
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:18,160
up a document, whatever. You can use a Google doc. It doesn't matter. You can use a note,

77
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,840
a sticky note. It does not matter. But the first thing that we're going to do is we're

78
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:27,280
going to use a tool. And it doesn't matter what tool you use. I just want you to use

79
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,800
the same tool every time you do this. So whatever you decide to choose, whatever you decide

80
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,480
to go with, use that again and again and again. Don't be bouncing here and there and

81
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,120
everywhere and using different tools because we want to keep this consistent. So what we're

82
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:44,480
going to do is we're first going to choose a tool. Okay. And for this example, I'm going

83
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:51,480
to use SEMrush. Now with this product, there is a 14 or seven day trial. I don't know.

84
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:56,700
It is an expensive product. It's just something that I'm familiar with. And the person that

85
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,560
I learned from the beginning was using it. So it's something I'm familiar with and I'm

86
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,840
going to be able to teach this really quickly using SEMrush. Now there's other examples

87
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:10,240
or other options you can use. Ahrefs, Mangools, Google Keyword Planner is a great free tool

88
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,840
that I would definitely recommend using if you don't want to spend money. For the sake

89
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,080
of this example, I'm going to use SEMrush. Okay. So what we're going to do is we're going

90
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:23,320
to choose a tool and then we are going to go and we're going to find out within the

91
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:30,320
niche that you selected, we're going to find the 10 to 15 main most highly searched terms.

92
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,440
So for example, I'm going to show you and demonstrate here in a second with concrete.

93
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,080
Within concrete, there's a lot of things that people could search. They could search cheap

94
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:44,920
concrete. They could search how much does concrete cost. They could search concrete

95
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:50,880
contractors. They could search concrete patio. Which of those terms are the most highly searched

96
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:56,720
nationwide or in your country? If you're outside of the US, totally fine. Which of these terms

97
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,200
are searched most in your country? That's what we're going to do first. Okay. So I'm

98
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:05,160
going to show you an example right now. All right guys. So again, like I said, I'm going

99
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:10,480
to use SEMrush for this. I think it's SEM. It might be SEM. I don't know, but it's going

100
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,840
to be really, really simple. So if you're doing concrete and we're going to use this

101
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:18,640
example because I am assuming a lot of people are going to use, are going to go into concrete.

102
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:22,840
So you're going to start off with your tool, whether it's keyword plan or whatever. You're

103
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,480
going to just type in the main term, which is concrete. If you're using, if you're doing

104
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,160
spray foam installation, type in spray foam installation. If you're doing artificial grass,

105
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:35,480
type in whatever comes to mind. Artificial grass, fake grass, turf. Just type in something.

106
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,560
And what we're going to start doing is we're going to look at it. Okay, concrete. And we're

107
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,600
not going to add the city. We're not going to add any city because we haven't even got

108
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:45,120
to that point yet. But we're just going to type in the main term. So concrete. And I'm

109
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,040
going to look at this and go, okay, that's interesting. There's 110,000 searches. And

110
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,600
you could see this as keyword difficulty. Don't pay attention to this. It's not, it

111
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,440
doesn't matter right now. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to take that term. I'm

112
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,240
going to write it down. And then what I'm going to do is I'm going to start like looking

113
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:05,440
in these sections here for what would I would consider, uh, uh, they, they call them, um,

114
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:11,760
related. Sorry. I should just look at this related keywords. Okay. So concrete calculator,

115
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,800
you got to use your intuition as well because like concrete calculator, that's more of like

116
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:23,860
somebody that's looking to do their own project. So no concrete cowboy. No. So concrete contractors

117
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:29,840
near me. Okay. 40,000, 40.5 K. That's a good one. I'm going to write that one down. Okay.

118
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,200
And this is what we're going to do. And we're going to click on these and there's going

119
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:37,520
to be other ones that come up. Um, you know, and then we're also, okay, here's a good,

120
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:41,660
here's a good one. Concrete patio contractors. So we're going to kind of use our intuition.

121
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:45,980
So we're going to go through and first thing we're going to do is compile a list of the,

122
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:50,700
the main term and related terms. Okay. Another idea I want to share with you guys when you're

123
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:54,540
coming up with this, cause we need to go and get 10 to 15 terms is what you could do is

124
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:59,460
you could go to a really competitive city. So let's just use like, um, uh, let's use

125
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:05,780
Atlanta. So let's do concrete Atlanta, Georgia. Okay. And you can look at the top ranking

126
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:10,060
companies. All right. So for example, this is the top ranking company for this term,

127
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:15,980
Sudlow concrete. And you're going to use their site to generate ideas. So for example, concrete

128
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:19,260
contractors. Okay. That's interesting. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to type

129
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:25,180
in concrete contractors. I'm going to remove the near me and Oh, what do you know? 27.1

130
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:29,400
thousand. Boom. I'm writing that down. And then based on that, you can start looking

131
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:33,460
at the related keywords again. Right? Okay. We already wrote that one down. Now concrete

132
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:37,420
contractors. We're going to write that one down. Concrete contractor. That might be interesting

133
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:42,940
to write down. Right. And we're going to go back to their site. We're going to check

134
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:48,860
it out. Okay. Uh, we could look at top rated concrete contracts. I have done this niche

135
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:51,980
enough to know that's not, but that's something you could look at if you were just going into

136
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:56,140
the niche things you want to look at on the page is you want to look at, you know, their

137
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:59,700
service pages. There's, those are going to be the most highly searched terms. So for

138
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:06,180
example, um, uh, driveway repair could be interesting. I also know like just using my

139
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:11,260
intuition driveway repair, you know, it's probably going to be more high ticket, uh,

140
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:14,180
concrete patio. Let's just use that for an example. So I'll, I'll do one more example

141
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:20,940
and I'm just going to give you my list here. Concrete patio. Okay. Boom. 12.1 thousand.

142
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:25,260
So guys, and then look, stamped concrete patio. What I want you to first do is I want you

143
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:30,460
to make a list of 10 to 15 terms that are the most highly searched term in the niche

144
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:35,520
that you selected. Okay. All right, guys, I went ahead and just grabbed one of my keyword

145
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,800
lists. Uh, I mean, we go into this niche, we're in this niche all over the country.

146
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:44,040
So I know what keywords are good. Don't mind the highlighted stuff. I'll explain that in

147
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:50,640
a moment. So this is my compiled list. I did 18 terms. Um, it's not, you know, it's, it's

148
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:54,400
not a hundred percent complete, but I I've done this enough to know these terms are really,

149
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:59,360
really good. So I got concrete contractor, concrete company, concrete driveway, and I

150
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,480
just have them listed here. Okay. So what you want to do is you want to have your list.

151
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,080
And by the way, I have this in base camp. Don't recommend this. Um, I just, I'm telling

152
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,960
you that so you don't go and think you need to get base camp. There's something we use

153
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:14,320
and it's just already in here, but it's not worth the money. Um, I'm telling you that

154
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,240
in fact, we got a free trial of this. And so that's why I'm still using it. Okay. So

155
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:24,480
what you're going to do is you're going to take your, your, let's call it 10 to 15 keywords.

156
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,880
And then what you're going to do from there is you're going to take, and you're going

157
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:34,400
to use your intuition and you're going to select five to 10. I prefer like seven being

158
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:39,000
the sweet spot. You're going to select five to 10 of these keywords closer to five than

159
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,760
10. In fact, I'm just going to tell you, do five top set. Okay. Five to seven of these

160
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:49,880
keywords. And I'm going to have you use your intuition and say, okay, would that keyword

161
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:54,800
be something I want to focus on because of, uh, it's high ticket. It's, you know, it's

162
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,480
not someone that's looking around like, for example, uh, conk, cheap concrete near me.

163
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:04,000
I don't want those leads. That's some cheap ass. I don't want that. Okay. So anyway, I

164
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,880
went ahead and these highlighted ones are the ones that I determined as, you know, they're

165
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,800
really interesting keywords to me. And so what we're going to do is pick those five

166
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:18,520
to seven and these are going to be what we call core keywords. Okay. So just to recap,

167
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:22,240
we're going to go in, we're going to pick, or we're going to go find the terms that are

168
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:27,520
most searched across the nation. Okay. Concrete concrete contractor, concrete company, concrete

169
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:32,320
driveway, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. From that list of 10 to 15 to 20, we're going

170
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:37,360
to select five to seven of those keywords. And here's the interesting thing. It's not

171
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,200
always based on the search volume. Cause if you look at the actual total volume, notice

172
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:48,000
how concrete repair has more volume than a lot of these terms are very similar volume

173
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,240
to some of these terms, yet it didn't make the cut, right? Because I know people looking

174
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,600
for concrete repair. Those are really small jobs. Okay. So you're going to pick those

175
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:01,220
top terms. Okay. And I didn't include that because I just decorative concrete kind of

176
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:05,500
goes with polished concrete, but it's, it's didn't, I didn't, I didn't include it. Okay.

177
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:09,520
And you're going to come up with what are called your core keyword list. Okay. That's

178
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:16,520
going to be five to seven keywords. Now what you're going to do from here is very simple,

179
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:23,600
but we're going to build what are called expanded core keyword list for each of these terms.

180
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,800
Okay. So I'm going to tell you the terms that I selected. I selected concrete contractor.

181
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,320
I put, I don't know even know why this, this, in fact, I need to edit that. That shouldn't

182
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:37,120
even be in there. Concrete specialist should not be in there. In fact, for the sake of

183
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:43,320
this, let me go ahead and just delete this. Um, that, that was not done by me. Um, yeah,

184
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,760
I don't actually know why that's in there. Okay. There's no volume. It's not a great

185
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:52,000
term. So just forget you ever saw a concrete specialist. Don't add it. Stupid term. Not

186
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,360
that much volume, not that great of a term. Okay. But here are the core keywords that

187
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:00,600
I chose. Okay. To build my expanded lists on. And this is all going to make sense. So

188
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:07,600
just stay with me. Okay. Concrete contractor, concrete company, stamp concrete, concrete

189
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:14,960
staining, concrete driveway, concrete patio, polished concrete. Okay. I actually did like

190
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:22,720
eight or nine of these. Um, but I recommend doing seven. I don't, I actually do not use,

191
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:28,840
um, I can tell you this because we just did a site recently. I don't use these, uh, decorative

192
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:32,680
concrete terms. They were just built because we, in the beginning we thought we were going

193
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:37,800
to do that. So something important to note about concrete, there is decorative side and

194
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:41,800
then there's the flat work side. And most of these people, they want flat work stuff.

195
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,140
So I would, I would err on that side. But what I'm going to show you is you're going

196
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:48,040
to pick your five to seven terms. If you want to do a couple more, that's totally fine.

197
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,960
It's just going to take you a little bit longer. Guys. So what we're going to do is we're going

198
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:55,400
to take those five to seven keywords, your core keywords, and we're going to build an

199
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:59,540
expanded keyword list. Okay. And so what we're going to do is very, very simple. You're going

200
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:02,900
to take your first term. Okay. So you're going to go over and take your first term

201
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:06,660
concrete contractor. Okay. You're going to come over here and you're going to type it

202
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:11,580
into Google. Okay. And then what you're going to do is you're going to scroll the bottom

203
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:15,540
and you're going to see these related searches and it's going to give you ideas. These are

204
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:18,860
things people are searching and I want you to use your intuition. Should this be added

205
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:23,300
to the list or not? So concrete contractor near St. George, Utah. I'm not going to do

206
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:26,220
that one because I don't even know if I'm going into St. George yet. We're just picking

207
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:32,660
the niche at this point. So no near Las Vegas. No concrete pouring near me. Maybe. Okay.

208
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:36,780
Maybe you would add that. Maybe not concrete contractor salary. No, that's going to pull

209
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:41,140
people looking for jobs. Okay. Residential concrete contract. That's a really good one.

210
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:43,700
I would add that to my list. Okay. And what you're going to do is you're going to take

211
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:48,480
that keyword and you're going to go over here and you're going to add it to your list. Okay.

212
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,620
And you guys don't overthink this. Don't overthink this. Okay. Con concrete contractor jobs. No.

213
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:56,300
Okay. Not doing that one. Concrete calculator. Probably not doing that one. That's probably

214
00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:00,460
somebody looking to do a project themselves. Residential concrete contractors near me.

215
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:04,180
Yeah, we might, but it's getting a little long tail. So I don't know. Okay. So that's

216
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:06,620
what you're going to do is you're going to do that with all of your terms and you're

217
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:10,940
going to start building these individual lists. Another thing that you can do is you can go

218
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:15,580
and use the alphabet. So you go to concrete contractor. In fact, it typically, let me

219
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:21,180
go ahead and let go like this and open a new incognito window and do in concrete contractor

220
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:31,180
actually, let's go to Google first. Okay. We're going to go concrete contractor. Okay.

221
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:35,860
And then we're going to start with the letter A. Okay. Type in A. Whoops. And you're going

222
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:39,060
to see, why is it caps? There we go. And you're going to look and see if there's anything

223
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:44,060
with A. Association? No. Atlanta? No. Aberdeen? No. No. It's a lot of, a lot of city stuff.

224
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:53,460
So no. Okay. Okay. B. No. A lot of cities. Business plan. Nope. C. Okay. Concrete contractor

225
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:58,020
contract. No. Cost. Concrete contractor cost. That's an interesting one. I'd add that to

226
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:02,500
my list. Concrete contractor companies near me. Add that to the list. Okay. I'm still

227
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:09,900
going to avoid the calculator. We're going to go D. No. No. E. Estimate. I'd probably

228
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:19,580
add that. Okay. F. Nothing. G. Lot of cities with this term. And you're going to do this

229
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:25,140
H. Okay. You're just going to keep doing this with every one of your course. You're going

230
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,780
to do this five times all the way through the alphabet. And for whatever reason with

231
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:32,340
concrete contractor, you're going to kind of get a lot of cities, but let's try and

232
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:38,620
change the term. Let's do concrete patio and let's go A. Okay. Now you can see there's

233
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:45,880
a lot less cities. So A. Alternatives. Probably not. Around window well. No. Against house.

234
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,860
Probably around pool. I'll probably add that one. Depending on where you're at. Right?

235
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:52,180
If you're in somewhere that doesn't have pools, like where I grew up, don't do that. Okay.

236
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:56,820
It's not going to be a good one. Concrete patio and fire pit. Maybe. Okay. B. Concrete

237
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:00,300
patio blocks. And you're just going to go through and you're going to just use your

238
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:04,060
intuition. You're going to grab the ones that make sense. Concrete patio backyard. What

239
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:11,660
you would search for as a consumer, as a customer that would be interesting? C. Cost. I think

240
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:16,380
we talked about that one. Yes. Concrete patio contractors near me. Yes. Concrete patio contractors.

241
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:23,380
Yes. Concrete patio cleaner. No. Concrete patio square foot. Maybe. But probably not.

242
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:27,380
Concrete patio coatings. Yes. Go to D. And you guys, you're just going to go through.

243
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:31,500
So to recap, you're going to go through all of your five core keywords. You're going to

244
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:34,860
type it in. You're going to, you know, for patio, you're going to first go to the bottom.

245
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:40,420
You're going to look at related. You're going to grab the related block. Heck no, Google.

246
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,980
You're going to look at the related. You're going to add those to the list. And then you're

247
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:47,260
going to do the alphabet game. You're going to go A through whatever with the term. So

248
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:52,820
concrete patio space. Okay. Concrete patio space in every letter of the alphabet. And

249
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:55,940
look at the auto fill suggestions. And what you're going to do is you're going to build

250
00:19:55,940 --> 00:20:01,340
out these expanded keyword lists. And guys, if you get the keyword, the core keywords

251
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:05,660
dialed in and you then expand the keyword list, you're going to be off to a great start.

252
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:10,660
You're going to be able to use this keyword list over and over and over. So guys, to recap,

253
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:14,820
what you're going to do is you are going to go and pick a tool. Okay. If you don't want

254
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:20,420
to spend money, do Google keyword, Google keyword planner. I think that's what it's

255
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:24,380
called. Okay. Pick a tool and stick with that tool. Then you're going to go and you're going

256
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:29,820
to type in the main term. And from there, you're going to start building a list of 10

257
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:35,460
to 15 to 20 core keywords. Things that people, they're the most highly searched thing based

258
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:40,860
on what this tool tells you. Okay. From that list, you are then going to pick five to seven

259
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:45,980
core keywords. From those core keywords, you are going to build an expanded list on each

260
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:50,160
of those keywords. And you're going to do it by first typing it into Google and looking

261
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,680
at the very bottom at the related keywords and then going to Google and typing in the

262
00:20:54,680 --> 00:21:00,920
keyword, pushing space and then the letter A and then looking at those automatic fills.

263
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:04,040
Hey, do any of these make sense? You're going to do that for every single letter of the

264
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:07,800
alphabet for all five to seven keywords. I know it sounds like a lot. I know that, but

265
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:11,840
guys, if you do this once and you do it correctly for concrete, you're never going to have to

266
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:16,440
do this. If you do 15 concrete sites, a hundred concrete sites, you will never have to do

267
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:21,360
this again. So it's worth doing and doing correctly. And I want to say this last thing.

268
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:26,720
Do not overthink this. Do not overthink this. Remember our goal is to go into cities and

269
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:32,840
niches with low competition. So even if we do this 75% correctly, we're going to win.

270
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:36,600
But I'm telling you, if you do this correctly and you take the time, it is going to help

271
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,520
you immensely. And you're going to be able to use this keyword for your ads. You're going

272
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,680
to be able to use this keyword list for your ad copy. You're going to be able to use it

273
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:48,840
for your SEO, for your content. It is worth doing and doing correctly. And you only got

274
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,840
to do it once.
