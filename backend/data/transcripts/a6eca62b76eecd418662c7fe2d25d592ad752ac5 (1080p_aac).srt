00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,280
Another question that comes to us is regarding the the CPC limits. Some people want to know

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:12,440
how do you know or what is too high for CPC. So when we go through our Google Keyword Planner

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:18,920
it gives us a range of the low page and the top of page bid. Sometimes those are within a few dollars

4
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:24,040
of each other. Sometimes there's wide variance. Sometimes you have a low page bid at like six

5
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:29,000
dollars and the top of page bid could be closer to thirty dollars. When you have those big ranges

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,720
it makes it a little more difficult to figure out. But what I typically see when I get that

7
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:40,720
question is that, and this is an example I have on the screen right now, is that you're choosing

8
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:45,920
a large city which you're not supposed to do and you're choosing a very competitive niche which

9
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:51,400
you're not supposed to do. So when we see a large city in a competitive niche you're going to see

10
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:59,920
that larger more expensive CPC. What is too much? You know according to the training we try to keep

11
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:05,040
it between like five like around the five dollar range on Simrush. As you go into the ad you'll

12
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,200
see sometimes it's a little bit more. But here I have something brought up. This is an ad that we

13
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,880
were running for Nick for a little while and it was for duck cleaning. I believe that the website

14
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,840
was starting to get some its own organic leads but we were having CPC of up to forty dollars per

15
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:25,240
click on some of these. And you can see here that we're able to be really good and we're able to

16
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:30,040
play and keep our average CPC in the ten dollar range and sometimes the fourteen dollar range.

17
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:37,960
But knowing that niche, and this is for the New Orleans area, so big city, expensive niche, knowing

18
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:42,280
that it is we know that we're going to spend more. We know it's going to cost a lot to get those leads

19
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:49,520
and so for us running that ad we weren't afraid of having those thirty dollar clicks because we

20
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,320
know what we were going to get on the other side. We know what niche we were playing in. So for you

21
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:58,680
guys if you're seeing something that seems way high up there I'd ask you to go back look at the

22
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,640
population of the city. Look at the population that you're running your ads over and think about

23
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,240
what niche you're running because that's typically where I see where that becomes an issue.
