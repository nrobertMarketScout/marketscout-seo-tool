1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,400
So guys, you start building your list and you're like, well, there's not that many people

2
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,160
paying for Google ads.

3
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,800
There's a couple on Home Advisor, but should, like, what do I do and should I continue to

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,700
pursue this if there's not that many people paying for Google ads?

5
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:25,240
That is a really good question and I'm going to talk about that right now.

6
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:29,120
So I want you to have, like, think about it this way.

7
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:33,000
The first thing that you want to think about is, okay, you're in Utah, you're in Pennsylvania,

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,400
you're in California, wherever you're sitting, and you're probably searching for, you know,

9
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,320
these searches in a different state.

10
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,280
Maybe not, but most likely you are.

11
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,080
And so one of the reasons why you might not be seeing ads is because of where you're searching

12
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,080
from.

13
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,680
Now, that's not always the case, but that is sometimes the case.

14
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:54,640
So I'm going to recommend a couple of tools that you can use where you can put in the

15
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,040
search terms and you can put in the city and it's actually going to search it as if

16
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,040
you were there.

17
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:05,720
Okay, it's going to kind of, like, change your IP address, if you will, and it's going

18
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:10,640
to give you different search results, different ads are going to show up because it's going

19
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,640
to look like you're actually there.

20
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,280
So a couple of those tools, if you look at my screen here, a couple of those tools that

21
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,760
I'm going to recommend, I actually have never used this one, I kind of like it.

22
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,800
I'm not sure, it looks like there's a paid, like, you could do a free trial.

23
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,480
I got a couple of searches for free.

24
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,760
It was seranking.com, actually really cool.

25
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,760
Like that one a lot.

26
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,760
You could check that out.

27
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,600
You literally put in the keyword, you know, country's already there unless you are in

28
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,960
Australia, Canada, I don't care where you're at, you put in the country and then you put

29
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,960
in the location.

30
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,960
So that was cool.

31
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,740
I checked this box.

32
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:48,880
Another popular fan fave is the valentine.app.

33
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,560
That's one that's kind of an OG, if you want to check that one.

34
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:57,680
So a couple of tools that you can check out to change what it looks like your location

35
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,160
is to give you a different search result.

36
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,760
The next thing that I do is this.

37
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,960
That's number one.

38
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,000
Next thing that I do, if you keep following along with me here on the screen, is if you

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,480
type in the city that you're targeting, so let's say Queen Creek Concrete, and we go

40
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:16,560
to the map, I like to just look at this and go, okay, you know, obviously we're trying

41
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,840
to target these cities that no one else is necessarily, they're not on people's radar.

42
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,240
So Queen Creek, I don't know, it's right here.

43
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:30,240
So what are the cities and suburbs around that specific city we're targeting that are

44
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:35,080
bigger, maybe people, they're more on people's radar that people would be willing to drive

45
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,080
to?

46
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,640
So I'm going to start from here, I'm going to start typing in Concrete Chandler, Concrete

47
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:45,240
Gilbert, Concrete Mesa, Concrete Tempe, Concrete Scottsdale, even Concrete Phoenix, because

48
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,640
that is not that far.

49
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,880
A lot of these people, they advertise in Phoenix, but they're actually based down here.

50
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,680
The majority of the people I know and have talked to in the businesses I work with, they

51
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,560
don't live in Glendale and Phoenix proper.

52
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,680
They live down in the southeast corner with Chandler, Gilbert, Mesa, Tempe, Queen Creek,

53
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,960
they live down there anyway.

54
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:09,680
So what I would then start doing is after you look at the valentine.app, some of these

55
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,520
other tools, I would then just go use your same keywords and look at nearby cities,

56
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:18,800
because if there's a business that's in Chandler, that's not a very far drive, and that's almost

57
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,720
like a neighborhood, that's like a little suburb, if you will.

58
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,040
So those are the first two things that I would do.

59
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,040
Here's what you need to do.

60
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:30,320
Ultimately, though, this is what it comes down to, is you need to make a decision.

61
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:35,840
Let's say you do this, let's say you just still can't find anyone on Google Ads, or

62
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,840
there's maybe one person, or there's one person, but you're like, I don't know, maybe they're

63
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,880
a lead gen company, whatever, but there are people on Home Advisor, but there's just not

64
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,640
a lot of people paying for Google Ads.

65
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,640
You need to make a decision.

66
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:53,480
I will tell you this, it is possible to sell to somebody who is not paying for Google Ads

67
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,480
or advertising.

68
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,200
Yes, I have done it, there are many, many people that have done that.

69
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,800
And before I discovered how much easier this was, that's all that I did.

70
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,160
So yes, it is possible.

71
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,160
And so here's the decision you need to make, is you need to make the decision, especially

72
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,800
if it's your first deal, is this worth the squeeze?

73
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:14,760
Because you can turn any website that is producing leads into money if you try hard enough.

74
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,760
But I'm looking at opportunity cost.

75
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:24,640
So what I look at is, okay, given the situation, given this specific niche and city location,

76
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,960
is this worth going after at this time?

77
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,360
And here's kind of the rule of thumb that I would give you.

78
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:36,400
If this, for me personally, if I find a city like Queen Creek, and you guys watched me

79
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,760
do the due diligence, and it was absolutely ridiculously low-hanging fruit, there was

80
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:47,240
no competition, there was Steve, Steve Wood, or Steve whatever, that didn't even have a

81
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,800
website and he was showing up for everything, I mean, there was nothing, no competition,

82
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,000
and there's search volume, and there's CPC.

83
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,280
For me, where I'm at in my business, I'm going for it, I'm just full-setting, baby, I'm going.

84
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:06,160
If this is your very first deal, however, my advice to you is if this is your first

85
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,600
deal, and you do all this, and you cannot find people that are paying for Google Ads

86
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:15,760
after you've done the valentine.app and these different tools, you've looked at nearby cities,

87
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:22,200
and you're just not seeing that many options, my advice to you is skip it, earmark it, dog,

88
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:26,560
whatever that term is, put it on the back burner, save it for later, and go find another

89
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,960
one because the game is you gotta get your first deal, that's what we gotta do, no matter

90
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:36,640
what that looks like, no matter what opportunities you have to avoid, what opportunities you

91
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:41,240
have to pass up, we want you to get your first deal, because that first deal is gonna get

92
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,360
you the confidence, that first deal is gonna get that mental barrier removed, that first

93
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,360
deal is gonna lead to the second deal, the third deal, the fourth, the fifth, so my advice

94
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,280
to you is if this is your first deal, and you start looking around, and there's just

95
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,040
no one paying for ads that you can find, and you've done a lot of searching, you've tried

96
00:05:55,040 --> 00:06:01,640
all the different apps and tools and nearby cities, skip it, put it on the back burner,

97
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:05,480
and come back, I want you getting your first deal, I want you to go into a city where there

98
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,580
are hungry business owners, if you're somebody that has multiple deals, if you're somebody

99
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:14,200
that is making a decent amount of money, and you see a city like this, like in my case,

100
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:19,240
I am going to go for it anyway because I can afford to lose a little bit of money, I can

101
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:24,160
afford to go in and run the risk of there's no one that wants to pay for ads because it's

102
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:29,040
such a good opportunity that it's worth the risk for me, but if you don't have a deal,

103
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:35,040
or you really need that first deal, my advice to you is save it, skip it, and we'll come

104
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,540
back to it.
