00:00.000 --> 00:05.280
Okay, encouragement for members who only have enough positive cashflow to run one campaign

00:05.280 --> 00:09.520
at a time to get clients with, makes things move at a snail's pace.

00:09.520 --> 00:13.760
So yeah, I mean, the way I look at it, guys, is this, right?

00:13.760 --> 00:19.240
If you guys get in that situation where you're like, man, of course, Nick can do 24K in a

00:19.240 --> 00:20.240
month.

00:20.240 --> 00:21.240
He's got money to run.

00:21.240 --> 00:22.240
I do.

00:22.240 --> 00:29.920
But guys, remember that in 2019, not only did I not have money to run ads, I had $60,000

00:29.920 --> 00:30.920
in debt.

00:30.920 --> 00:34.640
And not only did I have $60,000 in debt, I had two car payments and not only did I have

00:34.640 --> 00:38.560
two car payments, I had a house payment and I had a wife and I had a couple of kids and

00:38.560 --> 00:43.520
I had this and I had that and I had bills and I think all the stuff and my wife just

00:43.520 --> 00:46.800
because I didn't have money didn't mean she doesn't want to go on vacation and she wasn't

00:46.800 --> 00:49.760
on Instagram and she wasn't talking to her friends who are going to Disneyland.

00:49.760 --> 00:51.840
Guys, I've been there.

00:51.840 --> 00:52.840
Okay.

00:52.840 --> 00:58.040
So my encouragement is that you have to look at it like, okay, first of all, let's not

00:58.040 --> 00:59.040
be stupid.

00:59.160 --> 01:03.960
Let's not go blow money, obviously, but also at the same time, let's just be really good

01:03.960 --> 01:05.200
about where we put our money.

01:05.200 --> 01:08.240
And yes, for the first little bit, it might feel like it's running at a snail's speed,

01:08.240 --> 01:09.240
but guess what?

01:09.240 --> 01:12.280
Once you get that first deal, it opens up a little cash and then instead of taking the

01:12.280 --> 01:17.160
cash and just go blowing it on something stupid, let's put it back in the business.

01:17.160 --> 01:20.360
And now maybe we can run too, but we're going to be smart about it.

01:20.360 --> 01:23.920
We're not just going to go burn in cash and boom, we got two deals.

01:23.920 --> 01:24.920
Okay, cool.

01:24.920 --> 01:27.440
Things are starting to go and now maybe we need to get a VA, right?

01:27.840 --> 01:32.160
So I think the thing I would tell you is like, the encouragement is I was there.

01:32.160 --> 01:35.160
I was there in 2019 when I was figuring this out.

01:35.160 --> 01:37.760
I was like, dude, what do I have to work with?

01:37.760 --> 01:39.320
What can I sell?

01:39.320 --> 01:40.400
What can I do?

01:40.400 --> 01:44.560
Which one of my sites that I built in another program is generating some leads that fits

01:44.560 --> 01:48.000
the criteria and has low CPC.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.280
And yeah, for the first couple of months running this strategy, guys, I was doing them one

01:52.280 --> 01:53.280
at a time.

01:53.280 --> 01:56.960
Literally, it was one at a time until we went and said, let's do 10K in a month.

01:56.960 --> 01:58.560
And then we started doing two or three.

01:58.560 --> 02:00.600
So I think it gets frustrating.

02:00.600 --> 02:04.880
We see everyone else smash the deal, smash the deal, smash the deals.

02:04.880 --> 02:05.880
Trust me, guys.

02:05.880 --> 02:11.880
I know that it could get frustrating, but also you got to realize just because it's

02:11.880 --> 02:18.000
taking you, whoever you are to get your first, it's taking you longer.

02:18.000 --> 02:23.640
I heard this quote one time and it gets over quoted, but like, I think it's we overestimate

02:23.640 --> 02:29.240
what we can do in a year and we underestimate what we can do in five.

02:29.240 --> 02:34.280
And some of you guys are overestimating what you can do in one month or two months or six

02:34.280 --> 02:35.280
months.

02:35.280 --> 02:40.040
Guys, if I would have stopped, I started doing this in 2016.

02:40.040 --> 02:44.160
If I would have stopped, if I would have at the year two mark or the year three mark,

02:44.160 --> 02:49.320
if I would have stopped and been like, well, guys, at the end of year three, I had made

02:49.320 --> 02:53.440
a couple hundred grand in three years.

02:53.440 --> 02:57.720
And then in literally in eight months, I went to a hundred grand a month and made seven

02:57.720 --> 03:00.840
figures in one freaking year.

03:00.840 --> 03:05.640
We underestimate what we can do or we overestimate what we can do in, you know, one year.

03:05.640 --> 03:12.000
And for some of you guys, one month and we underestimate what we can do in five years.

03:12.000 --> 03:17.040
The reason why I'm patient, but I'm still hustling, but I'm patient is because I'm going

03:17.040 --> 03:18.040
to be doing this.

03:18.040 --> 03:19.400
I don't care what recession comes.

03:19.400 --> 03:21.040
I don't care what business opportunity comes.

03:21.040 --> 03:24.840
I don't care who comes across my plate or what partnership comes, but I'm going to be

03:24.840 --> 03:25.840
doing this.

03:25.840 --> 03:30.200
And I promise you, for those of you that are like already shiny object syndrome, looking

03:30.200 --> 03:33.800
at other stuff and, oh, there's this thing over here, you'll be back.

03:33.800 --> 03:35.440
And guess who's still going to be here?

03:35.440 --> 03:39.520
Your boy, the king of digital real estate and the crown is going to be a lot freaking

03:39.520 --> 03:41.120
bigger when you come back.

03:41.120 --> 03:42.120
Okay.

03:42.120 --> 03:43.120
I'm going to be here.

03:43.120 --> 03:44.120
So that's why I don't get upset.

03:44.120 --> 03:49.040
I'll get worked up when Google changes the GMB and the recession's coming and it's winter.

03:49.040 --> 03:53.880
It's like, so, so I'm in this man.

03:53.880 --> 03:54.880
Good question though.
