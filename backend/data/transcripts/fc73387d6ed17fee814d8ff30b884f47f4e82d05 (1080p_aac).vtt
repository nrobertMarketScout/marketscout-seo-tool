WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.520
we went ahead and kind of took some content that we already had it's not great content so don't

00:10.520 --> 00:16.760
overthink it don't read through too much of the content that we have prepared this is just to

00:16.760 --> 00:29.000
show you how we add the content to your website so we have our Weebly page open okay let's start

00:29.000 --> 00:38.840
with the first paragraph I keep opening the wrong one there you go okay just going to copy

00:38.840 --> 00:46.320
website right here is the first paragraph and you're going to paste it okay make sure

00:46.320 --> 00:53.360
it's online to the side so it doesn't look silly we can definitely add a couple we usually like

00:54.200 --> 01:02.360
this content to the same length of the quote next to it so let's go and grab a couple more

01:02.360 --> 01:08.160
sentences from below and an easy way to you know because then you're like okay which part

01:08.160 --> 01:13.600
which sentence did I copy and paste it which one did I not so I usually highlight in yellow what

01:13.600 --> 01:22.800
I've already copied and pasted that way I don't duplicate the content on the website okay this

01:22.800 --> 01:32.640
seems enough make it yellow go ahead and copy that in here okay that looks fine now right here

01:32.640 --> 01:39.760
we put a page title so what could a page title be actually let's let's copy all the content and

01:39.760 --> 01:49.160
then we'll go ahead and make things pretty copy that bring it back here don't know why

01:49.200 --> 01:55.200
you did that no because it's the page title I'm gonna put that into the text there you go

01:55.200 --> 02:04.440
and again don't read through our content too much it is just a very simple that we were not

02:04.440 --> 02:10.760
going to use so it's not it's not great content it's just to show you how to structure it once

02:10.760 --> 02:11.520
it's on the website

02:30.720 --> 02:37.720
we can you can go on and build more like I would probably like to add probably a little more down

02:37.720 --> 02:42.040
here put a little spacer in there

02:51.240 --> 02:55.320
I think I already copied that yep okay

03:07.720 --> 03:24.280
I like to leave the very last sentences I'll show you how I usually use it copy make it yellow

03:24.280 --> 03:34.240
I'm going to copy that here okay the very last few letters I actually like to align them in the

03:34.240 --> 03:41.920
center I'll show you what that looks like so we can add that's a little too much so I'm going to

03:41.920 --> 03:59.000
you I'm going to just copy this part yeah okay add it down here I'm going back okay the very

03:59.000 --> 04:03.560
last sentence I liked it to be something like hey give us a call for a free instant quote hey

04:03.560 --> 04:12.960
if you want to get a free instant estimate on your concrete project give us a call or fill out the

04:12.960 --> 04:19.840
quote form right above something that catches that actually makes them do somewhat of an action and

04:19.840 --> 04:25.320
to contact us that's usually how you want it to end because people are not going to look at the

04:25.520 --> 04:31.440
very likely nobody's going to read anything of what you wrote but they're definitely going to

04:31.440 --> 04:37.040
look at the header where there's a big phone number and possibly at the bottom because when

04:37.040 --> 04:42.840
you go and look for a website we usually look at the bottom then we scroll scroll scroll to see the

04:42.840 --> 04:49.040
ending and then you look at the ending you don't look anything that's in between so we put those

04:49.040 --> 04:55.840
words and I actually like to align them in the middle perfect and I went ahead and copied the

04:55.840 --> 05:02.200
tracking number that I had from Coral okay now how do we structure it we kind of already structured

05:02.200 --> 05:09.040
it doesn't look bad this is definitely not even 2,000 words so yours is probably going to look

05:09.040 --> 05:17.040
more lengthy let's add some titles and the titles they probably want to be something that's a keyword

05:17.040 --> 05:29.600
so post this doc I'm going back to our keyword list we have extended um you can probably put

05:29.600 --> 05:46.360
something like concrete contractors let's get some ideas from Google I like that is a concrete

05:46.360 --> 05:55.920
driveway worth it and again some of these you're actually going to have once you write the content

05:55.920 --> 06:04.960
so like how I did that what is seemed concrete driveway that could be a title so is what was

06:04.960 --> 06:19.600
the sentence is concrete driver worth it okay and then we have one more again add a couple more if

06:19.600 --> 06:25.600
you have obviously you're probably going to have more content so go ahead and grab add more make

06:25.600 --> 06:33.040
it more structural so and more titles and the title can be a long tail keyword list it could

06:33.080 --> 06:38.280
also be just a short tail keyword so it could just be like stamped concrete could be a title

06:38.280 --> 06:43.040
so get creative it could also be the name of your company if you haven't used it in your content

06:43.040 --> 06:48.120
it could literally be Queen Creek concrete contractors or Queen Creek concrete that's it

06:48.120 --> 06:58.000
we already put that one we could put what are the pros

06:58.000 --> 07:14.880
okay there you go so just make sure that the structure once you're done copying the content

07:14.880 --> 07:21.440
actually looks like a structure professionally like you have a little bullet list here and there

07:21.440 --> 07:33.200
you can add more bullet lists you are adding see this is my bad this is actually you have some

07:33.200 --> 07:42.960
titles you have your phone number added on it and then what I like to do because we now need to

07:43.000 --> 07:49.120
link the phone number as a click to call so when people see the phone number right here I want

07:49.120 --> 07:53.880
them to be able to click it and call directly because if they're looking at this from the phone

07:53.880 --> 08:00.000
and that's something that I like to do consistently while I'm adding the content or really doing

08:00.000 --> 08:09.000
anything on the website is to okay so if you see this don't get alarmed so see how our first

08:09.000 --> 08:14.320
paragraph is gone because it should be before the quote form the reason why is because we have not

08:14.320 --> 08:21.120
added the corner image yet so because we don't have this corner image here it's actually canceling

08:21.120 --> 08:27.960
this out so don't worry about it yet as soon as we optimize it we'll do that in the next video we

08:27.960 --> 08:34.760
optimize we add images this will show up on the mobile section as well so let's just look make

08:34.760 --> 08:41.480
sure that everything looks good from the phone number from the phone screen okay that looks good

08:41.480 --> 08:48.560
to me perfect now it's let's inner link within your website and let's link the phone number so

08:48.560 --> 08:59.880
I see the phone number here copy oops highlight the phone number copy click the link phone and

09:00.640 --> 09:09.080
and put the same phone number click out of it okay see that now it's linked to a phone

09:09.080 --> 09:13.960
okay we probably want to make this bold and a color

09:13.960 --> 09:31.600
if you go on theme and change fonts and links this is you definitely want to change this so

09:31.600 --> 09:37.760
the link color I would probably do either a red or blue so people know that it's a link and they

09:37.760 --> 09:45.760
can click on it okay and then when you're going over with your mouse I would probably

09:45.760 --> 09:51.840
keep the same slightly darker and again this is up to you on how you want to do it okay so see

09:51.840 --> 09:56.600
when you hover that I don't know why that's not showing it doesn't really matter and what you can

09:56.600 --> 10:01.360
actually do is just copy this phone number because you already linked it it's ready good to go I

10:02.240 --> 10:10.320
click command F if you're a macbook type 480 to find any other phone number that you put in

10:10.320 --> 10:18.160
here there it is and I'm just going to paste that format that we made that way it's already linked

10:18.160 --> 10:26.480
we don't have to do this again all right now last part is inner linking so inner linking is if you

10:26.480 --> 10:34.000
know what a backlink is it's a similar idea but instead of doing a backlink outside of your website

10:34.000 --> 10:41.160
with other websites you're just interlinking it within your own connecting every page to each

10:41.160 --> 10:48.280
other so if someone ends up in on the corporate driveway they can roll into the home page and

10:48.280 --> 10:54.160
every other page okay and how you do that's pretty simple so we usually do three inner links per

10:54.160 --> 11:01.880
page and you usually want to keep a you usually want to pick a keyword that's what you're going

11:01.880 --> 11:11.920
to interlink so we have a stamped concrete service page so I am going to select stamping concrete

11:11.920 --> 11:19.080
interlink it to a standard page and I'm going to interlink it to our service page for stamped

11:19.080 --> 11:27.480
concrete that's it now we need a driveway one and again it doesn't need to be the same exact like

11:27.480 --> 11:34.360
you can put the driveway concrete in the link to link to be linked to the company's name standard

11:34.360 --> 11:41.880
page that's your concrete patio and then let's do one more and you want to do this for each page

11:41.880 --> 11:46.240
and make sure you are covering you're not doing the same two pages back and forth you're doing

11:46.240 --> 12:01.640
all of the pages here are the concrete services

12:01.640 --> 12:20.680
perfect and you're done make sure you can also change let's say you go dark let's say you go

12:20.680 --> 12:26.480
dark here you added the background and you want the background to be dark make sure you're changing

12:26.480 --> 12:36.560
the font to be white obviously and you do that again you can change the font and everything right

12:36.560 --> 12:48.480
here paragraph text you can change and you can make it bigger it does look a little tiny it's

12:48.480 --> 12:55.040
black I actually don't think that's black it's a charcoal so we'll make it more black should be more

12:55.040 --> 12:56.040
clear

12:56.040 --> 12:57.040
better spacing

12:57.040 --> 12:58.040
line height

12:58.040 --> 12:59.040
there you go

12:59.040 --> 13:00.040
you can switch it up

13:00.040 --> 13:08.040
pick whatever

13:08.040 --> 13:31.040
let me pick one that's pretty clear

13:31.040 --> 13:54.040
let's just keep this one and make sure you publish save and obviously keep doing that for all of

13:54.040 --> 13:57.040
your other service pages as well and you're done
