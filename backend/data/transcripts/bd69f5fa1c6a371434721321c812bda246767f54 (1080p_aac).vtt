00:00.000 --> 00:15.560
The pre-closed screencast guys this is a highly highly effective tool this is

00:15.560 --> 00:18.760
something that should not be skipped this is something that really needs to

00:18.760 --> 00:22.800
be done properly okay so before we top over to the screen I give you guys the

00:22.800 --> 00:27.320
template I want you guys to understand the objective of the pre-closed

00:27.320 --> 00:31.040
screencast which is part of the bigger picture of the setup which is part of

00:31.040 --> 00:37.000
the bigger picture of closing the deal okay the purpose and the objective of

00:37.000 --> 00:42.260
the pre-closed screencast is twofold number one is to overcome objections

00:42.260 --> 00:45.600
that you haven't covered yet okay and there are certain objections that

00:45.600 --> 00:49.960
we covered that we talked about that just fit really nicely inside of the

00:49.960 --> 00:53.920
screencast because it might be weird to bring them up during a phone call okay

00:53.920 --> 00:57.560
so number one is to bring up and overcome objections number two is this

00:57.560 --> 01:03.120
is an opportunity for you to basically pitch them without being interrupted and

01:03.120 --> 01:06.640
without having the pressure of them being on the call like it's really

01:06.640 --> 01:10.600
really nice because you can give this amazing pitch without them even

01:10.600 --> 01:14.360
interrupting you or without feeling like it's a pitch okay and so that those are

01:14.360 --> 01:18.200
the two objectives during this but this is something that I used to not do and I

01:18.200 --> 01:22.280
started implementing this about a year ago maybe it's even less not maybe eight

01:22.280 --> 01:26.480
months ago and it is what it works like a charm because it really gets them

01:26.480 --> 01:29.800
prepped for the call and you guys will probably if you remember back to when

01:29.800 --> 01:34.640
you joined this program okay you probably received a video and you should

01:34.640 --> 01:39.640
have received a video right before it said watch this video before we talk and

01:39.640 --> 01:44.160
during that I overcame a couple of last a couple last objections where I said

01:44.160 --> 01:48.880
hey if you need to talk to your mom or your dog or your goldfish or your aunt

01:48.960 --> 01:52.600
bring them to the call because we're not doing the whole I want to think about

01:52.600 --> 01:55.840
it thing okay and I was overcoming that objection and I and I showed social

01:55.840 --> 02:00.760
proof and I did a few things that's the equivalent of my pre-closed screencast

02:00.760 --> 02:04.360
that I'm gonna teach you here so let's hop over the screen so here we have the

02:04.360 --> 02:10.420
pre-closed screencast template and I want to share with you the structure okay

02:10.420 --> 02:13.240
so there's a couple things that you need to include you don't have to do it in

02:13.240 --> 02:17.760
this specific order this is the order that I do it in and I just want to

02:17.760 --> 02:22.560
explain it this way so the first thing is we want to make sure and by the way

02:22.560 --> 02:25.720
I'm gonna give you guys examples of this we're gonna have some some examples

02:25.720 --> 02:29.880
attached some examples there's tons of examples already in the group of actual

02:29.880 --> 02:34.000
screencasts that I've done so I'm not gonna share one in this video because I

02:34.000 --> 02:37.480
don't want to make it long I just want to share the template okay so the first

02:37.480 --> 02:40.400
thing is I want to share how we get our leads in the strategy behind it and the

02:40.400 --> 02:44.840
thing that I use here is I show them an actual example and I like to use the

02:44.840 --> 02:50.840
monopoly strategy slash concept so I explain the monopoly thing I say hey

02:50.840 --> 02:54.520
look when you're playing monopoly there's a giant board and the more

02:54.520 --> 02:58.360
properties that you can you know buy the better chance you have a win in the game

02:58.360 --> 03:01.840
and these properties at the top or the boardwalk the park place etc etc etc

03:01.840 --> 03:05.480
that's how I explain it and I explain how we get the leads guys I've been in

03:05.480 --> 03:10.480
groups where people ask they're like hey what happens at the business owner they

03:10.480 --> 03:13.760
ask what the website is if they ask what happens if they ask I'm getting the

03:13.760 --> 03:19.320
lead tell them okay guys you don't need to hide stuff this is a very straight-up

03:19.320 --> 03:23.480
process you do not need to hide anything so number one thing is I explain how we

03:23.480 --> 03:26.120
get the leads in the strategy behind again there's gonna be an example I

03:26.120 --> 03:29.240
show you this entire thing okay the second thing as I've listed here is I

03:29.240 --> 03:35.480
show example sites so I like to best case scenario is you show them a niche

03:35.480 --> 03:39.200
sorry you show them a site in the niche that you're going after so if you're

03:39.200 --> 03:43.120
targeting somebody that's doing concrete you show them an example of concrete

03:43.120 --> 03:46.320
you show them a site you show them results you use that as a case study

03:46.320 --> 03:49.680
however if you don't have one this is your first time going into that niche

03:49.680 --> 03:53.920
what I would do and what I typically like to do is I like to show them a case

03:53.920 --> 03:59.920
study an example or a site in that city or close to that city so here in st.

03:59.920 --> 04:03.200
George let's say I have a duck cleaning site but I'm going after tree service I

04:03.200 --> 04:06.200
might not have any other tree services my first tree service site but I'm gonna

04:06.200 --> 04:10.120
show them a duck cleaning site because it just relates they're like oh that

04:10.120 --> 04:13.400
guy's in st. George that lady's in st. George that makes sense right we're

04:13.400 --> 04:17.760
showing these examples so I put that right here preferably in their niche or

04:17.760 --> 04:22.240
in their state and city and then if you guys have a lot of leads coming from

04:22.240 --> 04:26.480
those projects let's say you have a site already built it's generating leads you

04:26.480 --> 04:30.440
can show that if you don't don't worry it's there's not specific things you

04:30.440 --> 04:34.340
need to show you it's just showing them that you've done this before if you have

04:34.340 --> 04:37.400
a really good case study and you can show them hey this business owner has

04:37.400 --> 04:43.640
gotten this many leads show them that okay I noted here if you don't have any

04:43.640 --> 04:47.720
projects you don't have any other sites leverage the group man leverage the

04:47.720 --> 04:50.800
group we have so many case studies combined between all of us in this

04:50.800 --> 04:54.880
program at the time of recording this it's so many case studies so many

04:54.880 --> 04:59.360
websites leverage the group so if you don't have any don't worry about it make

04:59.360 --> 05:04.480
a post search for post and say hey guys does anyone have a concrete project I

05:04.480 --> 05:09.760
can use as a case study use and leverage the group okay number three is I show

05:09.760 --> 05:15.720
social proof okay including screenshots of text messages reviews etc also

05:15.720 --> 05:19.000
sometimes show contracts whatever stripe accounts the proof number one I have

05:19.000 --> 05:23.120
customers number two that people are really making some some money so what I

05:23.120 --> 05:25.920
would recommend is anytime you're communicating with a business owner and

05:25.920 --> 05:29.960
they tell you about some amazing story that they closed a huge monster deal

05:29.960 --> 05:33.560
we've all been on the phone or you will be on the phone where the business owner

05:33.600 --> 05:37.520
says hey you sent me those leads I just closed a $50,000 job what I say in those

05:37.520 --> 05:41.400
situations I'm like hey just so I can use that as kind of a testimony I'm

05:41.400 --> 05:44.240
gonna message you here in just a second after we help with the phone I'm gonna

05:44.240 --> 05:48.880
ask you a question about how things are going if you would just respond don't be

05:48.880 --> 05:51.760
fake about it but if you would just respond and tell me you just what you

05:51.760 --> 05:55.880
just told me on text I can screenshot that and use that as a case study and I

05:55.880 --> 05:58.880
can use that as proof that this works if you wouldn't mind that would help me out

05:58.880 --> 06:02.520
immensely and guys I just have a folder of case studies so for example one of

06:02.520 --> 06:07.000
the ones I use you're gonna see this in the example is I had this lady in Las

06:07.000 --> 06:11.200
Vegas and she sends me a text she's like hey I just closed one of your leads for

06:11.200 --> 06:15.920
like 40 grand so I like to show that example I'm like hey here's one of my

06:15.920 --> 06:20.720
artificial turf clients in Las Vegas she closed the job for 40,000 bucks okay

06:20.720 --> 06:24.960
it's literally proving like hey I showed you the lead value calculator but here

06:24.960 --> 06:28.520
is proof that they're actually that these people are actually closing jobs

06:28.520 --> 06:33.200
okay so I like to show social proof including screenshots screenshots of

06:33.200 --> 06:37.920
text messages reviews etc and then I also like to explain this is where I'm

06:37.920 --> 06:43.280
gonna explain the deal structure so I will basically shit on commission I'm

06:43.280 --> 06:47.480
like hey just you guys know or just so you know here's how the deal typically

06:47.480 --> 06:50.760
works and how we do this first of all we don't and that's how I say first of all

06:50.760 --> 06:53.840
we don't do commission okay there's no skin in the game for you and there's no

06:53.840 --> 06:56.880
incentive for me to even send you leads because I don't even know if you're

06:56.880 --> 07:00.680
gonna close I don't do commission never have never will okay secondly I don't do

07:00.680 --> 07:03.680
paper lead and in the beginning just so you guys understand or just so you

07:03.680 --> 07:06.440
understand mr. business owner mr. business owner I did this in the

07:06.440 --> 07:09.720
beginning and I tell a story I say I used to work with this company and I

07:09.720 --> 07:13.000
sent them leads and we agreed a hundred bucks a lead okay here's what happened

07:13.000 --> 07:17.160
is I they were cool paying at you know I usually shoot high so I get kind of

07:17.160 --> 07:20.960
start price anchoring them I said they were they were cool at a hundred bucks a

07:20.960 --> 07:25.120
lead sending them 20 30 leads paying two three bucks two three grand a month but

07:25.120 --> 07:28.840
my whole goal the whole time was how do I jack these leads how do I get to 50 60

07:28.840 --> 07:32.520
70 because I wanted to make more money obviously I'm human right and let me

07:32.520 --> 07:35.960
tell you what happened once I got and I had that month where the website ranked

07:35.960 --> 07:40.280
and the leads got spiked through the air and I sent them 70 leads and invoice for

07:40.280 --> 07:44.120
seven grand you know what happened they pulled out the red pencil and all of a

07:44.120 --> 07:48.280
sudden it became hey that lead didn't answer hey that lead was it was too far

07:48.280 --> 07:53.240
out hey that lead was a small job and it became this this whole nitpicky thing

07:53.240 --> 07:57.200
okay and it really strained the relationship so since that time that's

07:57.200 --> 08:01.320
been a while that's been two years ago three years ago I have done something

08:01.320 --> 08:05.120
that's been way better and it's called a flat fee deal and so mr. business or

08:05.120 --> 08:09.740
what that means is it's a flat fee deal you pay a certain amount every month or

08:09.740 --> 08:13.680
every week and you get every single lead from this website what does that mean

08:13.680 --> 08:16.440
well sometimes during the winter it's gonna be slow I'm gonna tell you that

08:16.440 --> 08:19.800
right now okay guess what in the spring when the leads are just crushing it and

08:19.800 --> 08:23.560
it's tax return time and people are cleaning up their yards and blah blah

08:23.560 --> 08:27.360
blah I'm not gonna come out to you for more money okay so you know exactly how

08:27.360 --> 08:30.680
much is coming out every single month and you get the upside of those

08:30.680 --> 08:36.600
additional leads okay that's it guys those are the things that I include in

08:36.600 --> 08:41.220
my screencast I noted here do not give price do not give price I usually let

08:41.220 --> 08:44.120
them know after I explain the deal structure I'm like hey as far as the

08:44.120 --> 08:48.240
actual cost per month or per week we're gonna discuss that tomorrow I got to

08:48.240 --> 08:52.800
finish writing the numbers but I promise you will be reasonable and then I last

08:52.800 --> 08:57.480
thing as I noted here is I like to end with a pullback okay so what I say is

08:57.480 --> 09:00.160
hey so I'm look I'm really looking forward to talking tomorrow and by the

09:00.160 --> 09:04.360
way like all I want to do is see if this is a good fit if we find out this is a

09:04.360 --> 09:07.720
good fit let's make something happen let's make a lot of money together but

09:07.720 --> 09:12.200
at the same time if it's not no big deal you know there's a lot of companies to

09:12.200 --> 09:15.240
work with and I only work with one okay see tomorrow and I just end with that

09:15.240 --> 09:20.160
pullback I'm taking off the pressure I'm letting them know hey no big deal no

09:20.160 --> 09:23.980
harm no foul I end with that pullback guys the pullbacks you can use them

09:23.980 --> 09:27.180
again and again and again and you can never overuse them so guys after you've

09:27.180 --> 09:30.900
done the screencast and just so you know I should have mentioned this earlier the

09:30.900 --> 09:36.480
tool that I like to use is a tool it's called the Vimeo recorder in fact hop

09:36.480 --> 09:39.000
over the screen let me show you what I'm talking about so guys over here on the

09:39.000 --> 09:42.600
Google Chrome store if you guys aren't using Google Chrome you're crazy I've

09:42.600 --> 09:45.840
already mentioned this you need to be go to the just type in Google Chrome store

09:45.840 --> 09:51.060
and you can get this little plug-in or this little extension I apologize just

09:51.060 --> 09:55.260
type in Vimeo and it's this Vimeo record I love this one because you can just

09:55.260 --> 09:59.360
push up here you could probably see it right here you could just push this and

09:59.360 --> 10:03.560
like if I click it like this it's literally just gonna let me push start

10:03.560 --> 10:07.000
recording and I'm automatically there and then as soon as I'm done it's just

10:07.000 --> 10:10.680
gonna upload it to my Vimeo account okay so I really really like that tool but

10:10.680 --> 10:14.080
there's a ton of tools that you can use so make sure that you record the tool as

10:14.080 --> 10:20.520
a screencast that's number one number two when you send this screencast make

10:20.520 --> 10:24.120
sure that you can track it so you know there's like if you want to use loom

10:24.120 --> 10:28.640
that's cool too loom is gonna tell you when they open the screencast that's a

10:28.640 --> 10:32.460
cool tool I like having Vimeo because I use Vimeo for everything loom would be a

10:32.460 --> 10:38.000
cool tool because you can see it so what I typically do is I use a software where

10:38.000 --> 10:42.200
if I send this as an email I send a link as an email I can tell when they

10:42.200 --> 10:45.120
open the email and when they clicked on the link and there's a ton of tools I

10:45.120 --> 10:49.680
don't even want to mention any but I used to use one called banana tag which

10:49.680 --> 10:54.080
they've since kind of gone out of business I don't even know if my banana

10:54.080 --> 10:58.680
tag even works anymore and so I don't even have to ask myself guys what we're

10:58.680 --> 11:02.280
using at this time but I definitely recommend finding something and you

11:02.280 --> 11:09.360
could just go ahead and Google and type in link let's see like email opening

11:09.360 --> 11:14.440
software whatever and there's gonna be tons of options let me get rid of this

11:14.440 --> 11:22.160
this is really bugging me okay trash this get rid of this okay yeah so write

11:22.160 --> 11:25.440
inbox sales handy mail check whatever just use something so that you know

11:25.440 --> 11:32.800
when they open the link and when they watch the video okay lastly make sure

11:32.800 --> 11:37.200
they watch the video okay if you guys record these videos and then they don't

11:37.200 --> 11:40.720
watch them what why'd you record it right why did you record it make sure

11:40.720 --> 11:43.400
they watch the video so before you jump on the call say hey talk to you in 30

11:43.400 --> 11:48.560
minutes just want to make sure you watch the video before we talk okay that is

11:48.560 --> 11:51.520
going to be part of the the the objections we're overcoming part of the

11:51.520 --> 11:55.120
objections during that video so they have to watch it you guys notice before

11:55.120 --> 11:59.520
we got on a call before you join flat view mastery you were sent a video and

11:59.520 --> 12:04.680
and I said or whoever onboarded you said hey make sure you watch this video

12:04.680 --> 12:09.880
before we talk guys there is no hidden secret here I am doing the exact same

12:09.880 --> 12:14.280
process that I'm teaching right here and it's working like a charm and the last

12:14.280 --> 12:19.240
thing I want to mention is the length of these videos should be no more than 10

12:19.240 --> 12:23.440
minutes 10 to 12 max but guys if you start rambling on you start talking

12:23.440 --> 12:26.200
about stupid stuff that no one cares about you start talking about backlinks

12:26.200 --> 12:29.920
and you start including stuff that I didn't cover in the template you're

12:29.920 --> 12:33.200
going to lose them they're not gonna watch the video okay get to the point be

12:33.200 --> 12:37.720
conversational talk to them like you're talking to them in person and make this

12:37.720 --> 12:41.400
something that they can actually stand listening to do not get into backlinks

12:41.400 --> 12:45.840
and the ranking and all this crazy stuff and do not make this 15 minutes okay 10

12:45.840 --> 12:49.120
minutes or less the shorter the better the shorter that the shorter it is the

12:49.120 --> 12:52.920
more likely they are to watch the video
