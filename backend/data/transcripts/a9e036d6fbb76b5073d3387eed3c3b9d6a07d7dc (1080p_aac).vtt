Trust me on this, when people try and rush you through the process, don't let them.

00:07.720 --> 00:10.220
They want to jump on a Zoom call.

00:10.220 --> 00:13.300
I can't remember who dropped the one-liner, it was beautiful.

00:13.300 --> 00:20.220
But say something like this, hey, that's cool, I want to talk with you on Zoom as well and

00:20.220 --> 00:21.220
talk about this.

00:21.220 --> 00:24.380
But honestly, I only work with one company.

00:24.380 --> 00:27.940
So before we get too ahead of ourselves, I want to see how you actually handle these

00:27.940 --> 00:32.180
leads before we, you know, I waste my time or you waste your time.

00:32.180 --> 00:33.180
It's a two-way street here.

00:33.180 --> 00:36.300
I'm not, you know, I'm not looking for everybody, okay?

00:36.300 --> 00:40.100
So they want to start pushing you, pull back, pull back.

00:40.100 --> 00:42.220
It's going to make them want you more.

00:42.220 --> 00:46.640
You're going to become the pretty girl in the club that everybody wants to touch, everybody

00:46.640 --> 00:51.220
wants to dance with and ain't nobody got business touching and they're not going to, okay?

00:51.220 --> 00:53.100
That's who you're going to become by pulling back.

00:53.100 --> 00:55.900
So follow the process.
