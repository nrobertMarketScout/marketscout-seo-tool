1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,800
Guys, let's put this all together. Let's do this from start to finish. And what I want

2
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:19,800
you to do, I want you to hop over to the perfect prospecting script. And I'm going to pull

3
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,640
it up on my screen right now. Guys, this is the perfect prospecting script. And at the

4
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,720
top, I'm just going to go through this really, really briefly so we can put this all together.

5
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:33,320
At the top, I've kind of just put this as a way to just mentally see how this works.

6
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:38,440
So the way that this was explained to me when I first got into sales, when they were teaching

7
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:43,600
me like, okay, here's the steps to a perfect approach. Here's the steps to a perfect door

8
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:50,760
approach or a perfect cold call. They described it, the managers, and I had really, really good

9
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,840
trainers, people that really knew their stuff. So I love sharing this stuff, but it's the sizzle

10
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,120
and the steak. So the sizzle is you call them, you grab their attention, you break the ice.

11
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:08,880
The steak is, hey, here's the step. Here's exactly what I'm doing, why I'm calling, the deal,

12
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,160
and the transition. The sizzle is grabbing their attention. So just maybe as more of a visual,

13
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,360
think of it as a sizzle and a steak, just like you would when you're grilling a steak. So you

14
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,440
got that sizzle to grab their attention. Then you got the actual, the thick of it, the steak.

15
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:25,600
And that's the way that I think about it. So I just listed here, the sizzle is to grab the

16
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,000
attention, break the ice, get them to ask in their head, what the hell is this guy doing?

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,400
You're getting their attention. And then the steak is the steps. Who you are, what you're doing,

18
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,920
what's in it for them, what's in it for you, and transition. This is one step combined,

19
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:44,320
that's the deal, but I just separated it out. So guys, the funny thing is, or not the funny thing,

20
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:50,720
but the ironic part is, this doesn't look like much. This has every step that we just covered.

21
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:57,440
The who you are, the what you're doing, the deal, and the transition all built in. So

22
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:03,680
if you guys choose, and you need to, for these first couple calls, guys, read this verbatim.

23
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,960
It doesn't matter. It does not matter. And if you read this verbatim, you actually will get

24
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:14,560
people on the hook. No shit. You will get people on the hook. That's how good this is. It is deadly.

25
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,280
Now, once you master it and you can just start speaking like a normal human, plus say these

26
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,240
things, you're going to be dangerous. Let's just go through this. So again, as we talked about,

27
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:31,360
first thing you're going to do is, hey, Jack, this is Nick. Do you guys do ex service? Do you

28
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,840
guys do patios? And again, this is going to be a slight variation of what we talked about,

29
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,880
the same exact concept. Do you guys do patios? Cool. Or do you guys do patios here in Little Valley?

30
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:47,520
You can combine it. Great. And then they're going to respond. Okay, great. And do you cover

31
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:53,120
this area, which we talked about? So, hey, do you guys cover Little Valley? Do you guys cover

32
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:59,360
Henderson? Do you guys cover Summerlin? Do you guys cover Norcross? A suburb of whatever, wherever

33
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:06,000
that lead is at. Do you guys cover 84790? And they're going to respond. Cool or excellent.

34
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,960
Last, lastly, how far out are you guys? You can even make a joke. Can you guys actually do

35
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:16,800
something in 2022 or in 2023? Are we looking at like in a decade? I mean, this is getting crazy.

36
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,360
Oh yeah, yeah. No, we're a couple of months out, but we can get, we can take care of you. Okay,

37
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,720
cool. Okay. And so then, and you'll notice here, like I make, this is a little bit different than

38
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,760
what I explained, but it covers the exact same thing. And so I'm not actually going to reshoot

39
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,400
this. Okay. Because I want to prove a point here. It's about hitting the steps, not about having it

40
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,880
in the perfect order. It's about hitting the main point. So in this script, this is the script I've

41
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:46,800
been using forever. This is how I have it listed. Ironically, as I was teaching and training the

42
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,560
last few times I've done it, I put this at the end and I want to keep it this way because I want

43
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,560
to show you that it doesn't matter. You just need to hit the point. So in this script, it says we,

44
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:01,680
we, we can say, Hey, I've got this lady. I got Janet here. Janet here in Little Valley. She needs

45
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:07,040
tree service or she needs a tree removal. And I just wanted to make sure you could help them before

46
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,680
I wasted any of your time. Guys in the, in the last couple of videos, I mentioned this at the end.

47
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:17,280
It doesn't matter. Okay. This is just how the script is right now. Okay. And feel free to make

48
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,960
some tweaks to this. It fit this, fit this to your style, but realize it's just about hitting the

49
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:28,560
points. I just want to go over that. Okay. And then I put to which you will continue. And guys, I,

50
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,320
I left out what the business owner is going to say in return, but you can kind of just interpret

51
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,160
the business owner is going to say, you know, who the hell are you? What, whatever, right? Who's this

52
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,880
guy? Like, what are you doing? Et cetera. Oh, sorry. Like I said, my name's Nick and I have a

53
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:47,200
website and phone number here in blank city in St. George. That's getting a ton of, or getting three

54
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:54,160
to five concrete jobs every week. Notice how I said jobs, not leads. Very important to, to notice.

55
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,760
Okay. And then I put here I, and guys, again, you could read this verbatim. It will work. Okay.

56
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:04,000
I was planning on sending you a couple for free before I take any of your time,

57
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:11,120
but to be candid with you, I am looking to find a partner here in Austin to work on an ongoing basis

58
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,640
or just here in Austin. Okay. Doesn't need to be perfect. Okay. I want you guys to see that this

59
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:21,440
doesn't need to be perfect. Okay. Continuing. I noticed, and again, you can probably just guess,

60
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:27,280
Hey, I transition right there. I noticed you're already paying for Google ads. So I know you're

61
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,960
hungry to take on more work and figured since I already, since I already have to work, why not

62
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,880
just work with you directly? Guys, it's just a different order of what we already talked about.

63
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:42,400
Okay. Again, so, and then you can imagine the business was going to respond. So let me send

64
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:48,400
you this lady. Let me send you Janet real quick, maybe one or two more. And then all I ask in return

65
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:53,920
is a conversation in a couple of days. How does that sound? Is that cool? Same thing, right? Just

66
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:59,360
in a little bit different order. Okay. You open to that and then literally I put in here, that's it.

67
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,000
I'm going to bold this actually on, on, I'm going to bold this. That's it. That's all you need to say.

68
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,960
Okay. And I even said right here, that's it. Do not discuss, in fact, I'm going to put asterisks

69
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:14,000
by this. Do not discuss price. Do not tell them you were looking to do a flat fee contract, blah,

70
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,040
blah, blah. You will lose the deal. We talked about this at the beginning when I said, do not,

71
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:23,280
you're selling dinner. You're not selling marriage. Okay. If they ask repeatedly,

72
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,320
and this is one thing I want to point out. Okay. And one thing too, I want to just add into this is

73
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:43,280
we need to add transition. Okay. Let me grab. What's the best email and phone number to send leads to

74
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:56,640
explain. By the way, I'm doing this real time. So you let's, I don't even, I hope this isn't

75
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:01,680
even getting edited out. I want to keep this in. Okay. Explain the live transfer

76
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:09,840
and then pull back if necessary. Okay. There's a couple of things I want to add. Okay. Last

77
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,360
thing I want to mention on this, cause guys, that's it. There's nothing else to talk about.

78
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,720
If you need to read the damn script, read the damn script, this will work. This is like,

79
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,240
this is why I call it the perfect prospecting trip. Read this shit word for word. It'll work.

80
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:27,040
Read it word for word. It will work if you need to master it, learn it, put it in your brain,

81
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,640
and then say it as you would say it. And you're going to be a deadly human being. You're going

82
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:34,880
to be a savage salesperson. Okay. You're going to be hooking people freaking left and right. Like

83
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,840
you're using some illegal substance. Like they do out on the, on the lakes where you use corn,

84
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:45,280
or where you use like WD or DW, whatever that stuff 40, where you spray it on totally illegal,

85
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,440
but it works like a charm. That's going to be you. Okay. Last point is this. Okay.

86
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:58,320
If they ask repeatedly about price, which they can and sometimes will, I mentioned here,

87
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:02,320
and I said this at the beginning, just push it off till the end. Hey, look, I'm not actually

88
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:07,920
worried about that. I do all kinds of different deals. Like honestly, that's the, that's the

89
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,600
wrong question. We're putting the cart before the horse. Let me get you a couple of jobs

90
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:16,480
before we even get to that. Okay. And if they keep going to like, Oh, just give me a ballpark.

91
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:22,640
Here's my response. Okay. To be honest, I have, I have somebody right now that's paying me around

92
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:27,600
three to $400 per month. And I also have a company that's paying me $50,000 per month. So it's going

93
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:32,800
to be somewhere in there. No, but seriously, that's not that like we'll, we'll work something out.

94
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,240
Don't worry about that. Okay. And we're just, we're just kind of, we're just saying, Hey, look,

95
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,520
it's going to be, it's too hard to tell at this point. Stop asking that question. Okay. But if you

96
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,920
need to satisfy them, cause they keep asking, I like to use that. And that's true. Hey, I got

97
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,720
somebody paying three, $400 bucks and I got somebody paying me $50,000. I definitely can tell you

98
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,560
you're going to be way closer to the bottom than the top, but we have a huge range. It depends on

99
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,880
a couple of things, but I don't, I don't want to waste time on that until we can figure out if this

100
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:04,080
is even a good fit. Okay. And back into it, back into the process, right? That's what's cool about

101
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:09,680
having a process. You have your steps and your transition. And if you deviate and start asking

102
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:14,320
questions outside of that, you can answer it and come right back to where you were at. If you, if

103
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:20,560
they cut you off in the middle of explaining the deal, cool. Answer it. Come right back. Like I was

104
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,440
saying, I want to give you a couple of free leads. Let's talk in a couple of days. Why don't I just

105
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,000
give you the leads in exchange for, we work something out. I mean, I don't know about you,

106
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,080
but unless you have some kind of a romantic relationship with Google or Larry Page or

107
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,960
Sergey Brin, I don't like, I would love to work with someone local. And I'm sure you would too.

108
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:46,240
Okay. Just address it. But the point is, and I mentioned this at the first, don't sell marriage,

109
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:52,000
sell them. Okay. Guys, that's it. This is the script. This script has been working like a charm

110
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,040
for me for years and years and years. And yeah, I had a couple of tweaks. You guys just saw me real

111
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:02,240
time. Add a couple little tweaks. Okay. The important part is that we hit the steps necessary.

112
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,520
And just to recap who you, first of all, the sizzle, okay. Pattern interrupt who you are,

113
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,720
what you're doing, which is a damn good reason why you're calling. Okay. And I like to make sure

114
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,480
that you remember that the deal, what's in it for them, what's in it for you, stressing more on

115
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:22,800
what's in it for you and the transition and drop in a pullback when necessary. Guys, that's it.

116
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,840
Hook these people. Let's get them some leads and let's get one step closer to closing the deal.
