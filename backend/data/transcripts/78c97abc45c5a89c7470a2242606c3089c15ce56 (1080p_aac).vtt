00:00.000 --> 00:05.380
I've had like, six, yeah, six cities now I've done concrete in

00:05.380 --> 00:10.160
Florida. Okay. And all the DD the search volume checked out.

00:10.160 --> 00:13.240
I mean, like, you know, when you search on SEM rush, you get like

00:13.240 --> 00:16.560
the main number on the bottom left, you have related keywords.

00:16.960 --> 00:19.220
I mean, add all those up. I mean, there were it was like

00:19.240 --> 00:23.120
100 200 300 searches a month, right? So like, the search

00:23.120 --> 00:25.380
volumes there, but it was getting no impressions after

00:25.380 --> 00:28.400
like eight or nine days. So I just went ahead and pause those.

00:28.400 --> 00:32.480
But um, and I took the number off a call rail, so I wasn't

00:32.480 --> 00:35.560
paying for it. I don't know if that does anything for like

00:35.560 --> 00:40.380
future payments anyway. Um, my question is, do you go back and

00:40.380 --> 00:44.560
test those cities again? Maybe like two weeks down the road,

00:44.560 --> 00:47.720
because maybe like the first time around for for whatever

00:47.720 --> 00:50.600
reason, there was like a glitch in the algorithm or something

00:50.600 --> 00:54.000
happened. And like the second time around, like it actually

00:54.020 --> 00:57.360
performed really well for you. I don't make no sense for those

00:57.360 --> 01:01.240
cities not to be getting zero impressions or two impressions,

01:01.240 --> 01:02.400
three impressions, you know?

01:02.520 --> 01:07.000
Yeah, I definitely will test them out. I'll circle back on

01:07.000 --> 01:10.480
everything. I don't do it two weeks later, though, like I'll

01:10.480 --> 01:14.600
wait a couple months. Okay, because I think it just my head,

01:14.600 --> 01:16.960
I'm always like, I wonder if it has to do because I know, like

01:16.960 --> 01:19.920
on paper, where, you know, you're really close to me. I'm

01:19.920 --> 01:22.720
in, I'm in St. George in Vegas, we're basically like, it's 70

01:22.720 --> 01:25.400
out there. And so I think, like, and I know what the weather is

01:25.400 --> 01:28.980
like in Florida, but also, I, so I'm always like, let's, let's

01:28.980 --> 01:32.880
like, wait till the next season and try it. So I'll pause and

01:32.880 --> 01:37.080
unpause shit. Because, and that's the same way I and I do that.

01:37.080 --> 01:40.080
Because when I used to sell door to door, there would be

01:40.080 --> 01:43.160
neighborhoods that I would give up on, I'd go, I'd knock the

01:43.160 --> 01:46.720
doors, and I had a bunch of freaking douchebags. I'm like,

01:46.720 --> 01:49.200
oh, I screw this neighborhood, I'm never coming back. But then

01:49.240 --> 01:51.680
like a couple months later, I'm like, now I'm going to go back

01:51.680 --> 01:54.560
in there. And then I would get that first deal. And all of a

01:54.560 --> 01:56.720
sudden, I would blow that neighborhood up. And I'm like,

01:56.760 --> 01:59.800
okay, I'm glad I didn't give up on that. So I always serve you

01:59.800 --> 02:02.920
guys, I did a training, like way back when my mood was in town,

02:03.200 --> 02:06.560
on just working your areas. And that's the same for projects,

02:06.560 --> 02:09.560
you guys have projects that like, you want to just pick and

02:09.560 --> 02:12.440
shit on them and like get rid of them and burn into the ground.

02:12.920 --> 02:17.760
Just relax, pause it, go get a deal. Get that momentum, come

02:17.760 --> 02:20.920
back and work on it. And the same with ads, pause it, if you

02:20.920 --> 02:23.300
get rid of your number, whatever, that's fine. And then

02:23.300 --> 02:25.740
just come back, you know, a couple months down the road. So

02:25.740 --> 02:27.780
I would definitely circle background, especially if like

02:27.780 --> 02:30.620
the CPC lines up, and their search volume and the whole

02:30.620 --> 02:34.380
deal, then I would just come back, I would definitely not

02:34.380 --> 02:37.220
give up on that would come back. Because if not, you could shoot

02:37.220 --> 02:38.340
them to me and I'll try them out.

02:39.780 --> 02:42.020
Yeah, I'm definitely gonna try them out again. Because like I

02:42.020 --> 02:45.940
said, everything is perfect. And these are cities that were like,

02:46.560 --> 02:51.700
in between Central Florida to like Tampa. So if you're

02:51.700 --> 02:55.140
familiar, you guys, so you got like Brandon Riverview, stuff

02:55.140 --> 02:59.020
like that 100,000 population. I mean, and I have I have a

02:59.020 --> 03:01.740
couple of sites, a few sites in Florida, like Gainesville,

03:02.540 --> 03:06.940
Ocala, you know, Palm Coast, St. Augustine on the East Coast,

03:06.940 --> 03:10.380
I have less population less search volume than those five

03:10.380 --> 03:12.700
did. Yeah, and they were they were getting leads and

03:12.700 --> 03:15.740
impressions left and right. Well, for those five or so, for

03:15.740 --> 03:17.860
whatever reason, they just weren't getting any impressions.

03:18.420 --> 03:19.180
Yeah, I don't know.

03:19.340 --> 03:22.780
Think about it like this. Yeah, I have a site called Cedar City

03:22.780 --> 03:24.940
concrete. I have a site Bentonville concrete, those are

03:24.940 --> 03:29.100
30,000 population. And they're like they're getting 30 like

03:29.140 --> 03:33.020
Cedar City is only getting probably like 10 to 20. But

03:33.100 --> 03:36.620
Bentonville has been doing 30. There is concrete volume in

03:36.660 --> 03:40.020
every city. I don't care where you're at. There's always going

03:40.020 --> 03:43.060
to be some like at least 30,000 plus there's going to be concrete

03:43.060 --> 03:45.020
volume. So yeah, if it's if you're talking 100,000

03:45.020 --> 03:48.300
population, all the metrics are there. Come back and hit it

03:48.300 --> 03:49.580
again. Okay.
