We're as salespeople, we get on these calls and we're thinking in our heads, you know,

00:04.160 --> 00:08.160
as soon as we get off the call, we think that the customer gets off the call and they're just

00:08.160 --> 00:13.760
thinking about us. Oh, should I join? Should I join this guy's lead generation program where

00:13.760 --> 00:17.920
he's going to get me these leads? And you think that they're sitting there writing lists and

00:17.920 --> 00:23.520
calling people and guys. And the reality is, is the second that you get off that call,

00:23.520 --> 00:27.280
they're not thinking about you. They're not thinking about you. And the highest,

00:28.000 --> 00:33.120
the most highest chance you have of closing that deal is on the call. And this is one of

00:33.120 --> 00:38.080
the lines I love that you use, Kyle. And your closing is you say to people, you know, as much

00:38.080 --> 00:42.880
as you're going to know, you're ever going to know about me, about this deal, this, you know,

00:42.880 --> 00:47.840
the most that you're going to know right now. That's, and that's the reality. They're not

00:47.840 --> 00:52.640
going to get off the call and go do more research. Right. And I know someone's going to go, well,

00:53.040 --> 00:58.800
yeah, maybe one, maybe, maybe Bob and Bob's a serial killer. Okay. That, that it's not the

00:58.800 --> 01:02.720
reality. People do not go and do more research. The reality is they have an answer. And I'll say

01:02.720 --> 01:06.640
that to people all the time. I'll say, look, here's, what's going to happen, Bob, you know,

01:06.640 --> 01:11.360
what the answer is. And I would rather you, I'm a big boy. I could sleep at night. I've got other

01:11.360 --> 01:15.520
people I'm talking to. This is no sweat, man. If this doesn't make sense, then that's fine. But I

01:15.520 --> 01:19.200
just don't want to be, you know, drug on it. I don't do, I don't, I don't do, I want to think

01:19.200 --> 01:22.640
about it. So I'm sorry if that rubs you wrong. That's just how I am. Here's what's going to

01:22.640 --> 01:27.440
happen. Bob, you're going to get off this call. And in five seconds, you are going to admit to

01:27.440 --> 01:31.360
yourself the answer that you already know. And it's either yes or no. So Bob, which one is it? Do

01:31.360 --> 01:38.640
you want to do this deal or you want me to go to freaking Jack down the street? Boom. Okay. That's
