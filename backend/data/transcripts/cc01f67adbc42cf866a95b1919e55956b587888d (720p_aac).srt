Tips on closing faster.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:03,900
I find it takes a few weeks to close

3
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,160
while it takes some like two weeks.

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,040
Nate Eath, great question.

5
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,640
My biggest advice for that is

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,580
you don't need as many leads as you think, okay?

7
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:22,720
I have closed deals where I've sent two leads

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,560
in a period of 24 hours.

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,760
They haven't even run the leads.

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,280
They've literally just scheduled the estimates

11
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,440
or yeah, usually scheduled the estimates

12
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:34,440
but they haven't even gotten the chance to get out.

13
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,200
But I can tell by the way we're talking,

14
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,960
I can tell by the rapport that was built,

15
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,400
I can just tell because I've done it enough,

16
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,360
hey, this person is ready to go.

17
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,280
This person's ready to freaking,

18
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,800
you know what I'm saying?

19
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,840
And I'm sending it.

20
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:51,040
So my only advice is test it, dude.

21
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,200
Test it at three leads.

22
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,640
If you have three leads sent, two leads sent

23
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,680
and it feels right, even though you're like,

24
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,960
man, that seems like it's only been two days

25
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,960
or I've only sent them two leads

26
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,180
but it just kind of feels like they're ready, send it, dude.

27
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,020
Try it out.

28
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,120
What's the worst that can happen?

29
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,920
You don't need to send as many leads as you think, okay?
