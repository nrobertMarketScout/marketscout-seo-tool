Okay. Does it matter which tool we use at all? Are some tools superior? No, I don't think so.

00:04.800 --> 00:09.120
I don't think so. I use SEMrush because it's what I was trained on. That's why I use it.

00:09.120 --> 00:18.960
I don't think you guys have to use SEMrush. Karina, SEMrush numbers are so much lower than

00:18.960 --> 00:25.920
other tools. Why don't we use Keyword Planner for volume and CPC? Yeah, great question. So again,

00:25.920 --> 00:36.240
it's based on what does the tool that you're thinking of show for St. George's Block Wall?

00:36.240 --> 00:42.400
What does it show for the site that you're looking at doing? Go find a site that's producing at least

00:42.400 --> 00:47.920
30 leads a month and look and see what the volume is on your tool and set that as a benchmark.
