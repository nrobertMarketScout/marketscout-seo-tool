00:00.000 --> 00:16.120
All right, let's build a killer keyword list. Now, what does that mean? Why are we doing

00:16.120 --> 00:19.440
this so early? I'm going to go over all of those things, but first of all, I want to

00:19.440 --> 00:24.560
cover why we are taking the time at this stage of the game. All we've done at this point

00:24.560 --> 00:27.240
is pick the niche, and if you haven't picked the niche, you pick a niche, and if you don't

00:27.240 --> 00:32.680
know what to pick, pick concrete, okay, just to recap from our last lesson. But we've picked

00:32.680 --> 00:36.760
the niche, you're like, why are we already doing the keyword list? Okay, so there's many

00:36.760 --> 00:42.160
reasons to this, and I'm going to go over a couple of them, but guys, it's very, very,

00:42.160 --> 00:47.800
very crucial that you stop what you're doing and you do this step. Don't just watch this

00:47.800 --> 00:53.960
module, or sorry, don't just watch this lesson, watch this lesson and do what I'm asking,

00:53.960 --> 00:58.840
okay? All right, so why does this matter? Why does it matter to have our keyword list

00:58.840 --> 01:03.680
dialed in? And what I mean by that is these are the keywords that we're going to be targeting

01:03.680 --> 01:09.600
for our SEO, for our ads, for everything within that niche. So let's just assume that we're

01:09.600 --> 01:12.800
doing concrete, because I've said if you don't know what to do, you're going to do concrete.

01:12.800 --> 01:18.880
So the number one thing, the first thing that I think you need to understand is that in

01:18.880 --> 01:23.880
order for us to run ads, which is going to be part of this game, now for some of you

01:23.880 --> 01:27.840
that already have sites that are producing leads, this process works just the same and

01:27.840 --> 01:31.920
you're going to use your leads that are already coming in organically, that's fine. But for

01:31.920 --> 01:36.640
everybody else that wants to pre-sell and is just starting, and this niche is starting

01:36.640 --> 01:41.200
from scratch, you are going to need to run ads, okay? That's how we're going to speed

01:41.200 --> 01:46.440
this deal up. And as such, we're going to have to set up keyword themes, or we're going

01:46.440 --> 01:52.720
to have to pick our keyword inside of our ads. So what keywords do we pick? Well, if

01:52.720 --> 01:58.640
we do the keyword list correctly from the beginning, that becomes very simple, okay?

01:58.640 --> 02:03.840
Also, what kind of ad copy do we want to include? Well, we're going to want to include some

02:03.840 --> 02:08.960
keywords into our ad copy. So, you know, it's very, very crucial. The second thing, so number

02:08.960 --> 02:14.120
one is we're going to need these keywords for the ads. Number two, remember that the

02:14.120 --> 02:18.200
long-term game here, unless you're somebody who's just going to come in and, you know,

02:18.200 --> 02:20.800
sell, and by the way, you could do this, but if you're somebody that's going to come in

02:21.040 --> 02:25.480
and sell a deal for a thousand bucks a month, run $500 in ads and just take the difference

02:25.480 --> 02:30.280
and never build out a website, that's totally fine. But I completely, completely, completely

02:30.280 --> 02:34.840
recommend that once you do that and you get the deal, you then take the money from the

02:34.840 --> 02:39.600
deal and build out the actual website. And when you build out the actual website, you're

02:39.600 --> 02:44.120
going to need to know what kind of content to write. And you're going to want to look

02:44.120 --> 02:47.480
at your keywords for that. And you're going to want to know what H1 tags, and we're going

02:47.720 --> 02:51.960
to, by the way, if you have questions on this, we're going to get into that. It's fine. But

02:51.960 --> 02:55.840
if you want to know what type of, you know, heading to use, you want to know what to put

02:55.840 --> 03:00.280
as your page title and your meta description and what to name your images, it all ties

03:00.280 --> 03:07.280
back to the keyword list. Okay. So it's super, super, super crucial that you spend the time

03:08.160 --> 03:12.920
to do this correctly. Also, guys, one thing that I made a huge mistake, and you've heard

03:12.920 --> 03:16.960
me talk about having to get rid of 125 sites. One of the things I made a huge mistake with

03:17.040 --> 03:22.040
is when I was doing my due diligence, my market research, whatever you want to call it, I

03:22.040 --> 03:26.240
used to just use one keyword. So if I was doing concrete, I would go type in concrete

03:26.240 --> 03:31.640
Orlando Florida, and I would look at the metrics and I would base it on one keyword. Okay.

03:31.640 --> 03:38.640
And guys, if you base a decision on one keyword, you are rolling the dice, man. It's like going

03:39.520 --> 03:43.320
and buying a piece of real estate and literally basing it off of one thing, basing it off

03:43.320 --> 03:48.160
what the rents are. That's like, okay, well, the rents are 2000 bucks a month. Great.

03:48.160 --> 03:51.920
That's not looking at how much capital expenditure you're going to need into the roof. It's not

03:51.920 --> 03:57.000
looking at HOA fees. It's not looking at, you know, is that a desirable area? Is the

03:57.000 --> 04:02.160
area growing? It's like looking at one factor of a real estate deal and putting money down.

04:02.160 --> 04:07.000
That's the same as using one keyword to analyze a deal. Okay. So I did this incorrectly and

04:07.000 --> 04:11.480
I didn't know what I was doing. So we're going to take this keyword list and we are going

04:11.480 --> 04:16.280
to use at least five of the keywords that we, that we derive from this keyword list

04:16.280 --> 04:21.760
to analyze the deal. So you need to make sure this is done correctly. Okay. I'm telling

04:21.760 --> 04:26.480
you, this is so, so important. I've done this the wrong way and it is a nightmare.

04:26.480 --> 04:30.440
All right, guys, the cool part about this too is you only have to do this once per niche.

04:30.440 --> 04:34.560
So if you're going to do concrete, you do this correctly. You do it once. Now, if you

04:34.560 --> 04:39.040
build five, 10, 15 more concrete sites, you don't have to keep doing it over and over

04:39.440 --> 04:43.600
you just need to build a keyword list once. Okay. And what I'm going to do is I'm going

04:43.600 --> 04:49.840
to show you guys an example of what happens when you don't do this correctly. You don't

04:49.840 --> 04:53.160
look at the keyword research. You don't analyze the competition correctly because you only

04:53.160 --> 04:57.440
look at one keyword. And I'm going to show you what happens. All right, guys. So I went

04:57.440 --> 05:02.720
into this niche called foundation repair and I will tell you right now, this is one of

05:02.720 --> 05:07.520
those niches that is very high ticket. I thought it was going to be a home run. It ended up

05:07.600 --> 05:12.480
being, oh my gosh, I don't even want to get into, I spent a lot of money thinking I was

05:12.480 --> 05:16.760
going to just crush it in this niche. But that's neither here nor there. What I wanted

05:16.760 --> 05:21.760
to show you is this site has been live for, I kid you not, multiple years. We've been

05:21.760 --> 05:26.640
running SEO on this site and it hasn't been done perfectly. But typically based on the

05:26.640 --> 05:32.640
way that I now teach it and the way that I now pick cities and niches, even without doing

05:32.640 --> 05:36.400
much, I would be ranking or I would at least be close to ranking. And I'm showing you right

05:36.400 --> 05:42.360
now at the time of recording, this site has been live for at least three years. At least

05:42.360 --> 05:49.360
three years. And for the main term, I am literally sitting on page five. I am literally sitting

05:49.640 --> 05:53.280
on page five. In fact, this is a website that's on my list. I need to just cut this website.

05:53.280 --> 05:58.240
This is not going anywhere. It's not doing anything. So if nothing else, guys, this should

05:58.240 --> 06:04.280
be a great example of why you have got to make sure to do this keyword list correctly

06:04.440 --> 06:08.000
so that you don't make these mistakes. All right. So guys, how do we actually build the

06:08.000 --> 06:12.120
keyword list? So what I would recommend is I like to either get a piece of paper, pull

06:12.120 --> 06:18.160
up a document, whatever. You can use a Google doc. It doesn't matter. You can use a note,

06:18.160 --> 06:21.840
a sticky note. It does not matter. But the first thing that we're going to do is we're

06:21.840 --> 06:27.280
going to use a tool. And it doesn't matter what tool you use. I just want you to use

06:27.280 --> 06:31.800
the same tool every time you do this. So whatever you decide to choose, whatever you decide

06:31.800 --> 06:36.480
to go with, use that again and again and again. Don't be bouncing here and there and

06:36.480 --> 06:40.120
everywhere and using different tools because we want to keep this consistent. So what we're

06:40.120 --> 06:44.480
going to do is we're first going to choose a tool. Okay. And for this example, I'm going

06:44.480 --> 06:51.480
to use SEMrush. Now with this product, there is a 14 or seven day trial. I don't know.

06:52.600 --> 06:56.700
It is an expensive product. It's just something that I'm familiar with. And the person that

06:56.700 --> 06:59.560
I learned from the beginning was using it. So it's something I'm familiar with and I'm

06:59.560 --> 07:03.840
going to be able to teach this really quickly using SEMrush. Now there's other examples

07:03.840 --> 07:10.240
or other options you can use. Ahrefs, Mangools, Google Keyword Planner is a great free tool

07:10.240 --> 07:14.840
that I would definitely recommend using if you don't want to spend money. For the sake

07:14.840 --> 07:18.080
of this example, I'm going to use SEMrush. Okay. So what we're going to do is we're going

07:18.080 --> 07:23.320
to choose a tool and then we are going to go and we're going to find out within the

07:23.320 --> 07:30.320
niche that you selected, we're going to find the 10 to 15 main most highly searched terms.

07:32.960 --> 07:37.440
So for example, I'm going to show you and demonstrate here in a second with concrete.

07:37.440 --> 07:41.080
Within concrete, there's a lot of things that people could search. They could search cheap

07:41.080 --> 07:44.920
concrete. They could search how much does concrete cost. They could search concrete

07:44.920 --> 07:50.880
contractors. They could search concrete patio. Which of those terms are the most highly searched

07:50.960 --> 07:56.720
nationwide or in your country? If you're outside of the US, totally fine. Which of these terms

07:56.720 --> 08:01.200
are searched most in your country? That's what we're going to do first. Okay. So I'm

08:01.200 --> 08:05.160
going to show you an example right now. All right guys. So again, like I said, I'm going

08:05.160 --> 08:10.480
to use SEMrush for this. I think it's SEM. It might be SEM. I don't know, but it's going

08:10.480 --> 08:12.840
to be really, really simple. So if you're doing concrete and we're going to use this

08:12.840 --> 08:18.640
example because I am assuming a lot of people are going to use, are going to go into concrete.

08:18.640 --> 08:22.840
So you're going to start off with your tool, whether it's keyword plan or whatever. You're

08:22.840 --> 08:26.480
going to just type in the main term, which is concrete. If you're using, if you're doing

08:26.480 --> 08:30.160
spray foam installation, type in spray foam installation. If you're doing artificial grass,

08:30.160 --> 08:35.480
type in whatever comes to mind. Artificial grass, fake grass, turf. Just type in something.

08:35.480 --> 08:38.560
And what we're going to start doing is we're going to look at it. Okay, concrete. And we're

08:38.560 --> 08:41.600
not going to add the city. We're not going to add any city because we haven't even got

08:41.600 --> 08:45.120
to that point yet. But we're just going to type in the main term. So concrete. And I'm

08:45.120 --> 08:50.040
going to look at this and go, okay, that's interesting. There's 110,000 searches. And

08:50.040 --> 08:52.600
you could see this as keyword difficulty. Don't pay attention to this. It's not, it

08:52.600 --> 08:55.440
doesn't matter right now. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to take that term. I'm

08:55.440 --> 08:59.240
going to write it down. And then what I'm going to do is I'm going to start like looking

08:59.240 --> 09:05.440
in these sections here for what would I would consider, uh, uh, they, they call them, um,

09:05.440 --> 09:11.760
related. Sorry. I should just look at this related keywords. Okay. So concrete calculator,

09:12.600 --> 09:16.800
you got to use your intuition as well because like concrete calculator, that's more of like

09:16.800 --> 09:23.860
somebody that's looking to do their own project. So no concrete cowboy. No. So concrete contractors

09:23.860 --> 09:29.840
near me. Okay. 40,000, 40.5 K. That's a good one. I'm going to write that one down. Okay.

09:29.840 --> 09:32.200
And this is what we're going to do. And we're going to click on these and there's going

09:32.200 --> 09:37.520
to be other ones that come up. Um, you know, and then we're also, okay, here's a good,

09:37.520 --> 09:41.660
here's a good one. Concrete patio contractors. So we're going to kind of use our intuition.

09:41.660 --> 09:45.980
So we're going to go through and first thing we're going to do is compile a list of the,

09:45.980 --> 09:50.700
the main term and related terms. Okay. Another idea I want to share with you guys when you're

09:50.700 --> 09:54.540
coming up with this, cause we need to go and get 10 to 15 terms is what you could do is

09:54.540 --> 09:59.460
you could go to a really competitive city. So let's just use like, um, uh, let's use

09:59.460 --> 10:05.780
Atlanta. So let's do concrete Atlanta, Georgia. Okay. And you can look at the top ranking

10:05.780 --> 10:10.060
companies. All right. So for example, this is the top ranking company for this term,

10:10.180 --> 10:15.980
Sudlow concrete. And you're going to use their site to generate ideas. So for example, concrete

10:15.980 --> 10:19.260
contractors. Okay. That's interesting. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to type

10:19.260 --> 10:25.180
in concrete contractors. I'm going to remove the near me and Oh, what do you know? 27.1

10:25.180 --> 10:29.400
thousand. Boom. I'm writing that down. And then based on that, you can start looking

10:29.400 --> 10:33.460
at the related keywords again. Right? Okay. We already wrote that one down. Now concrete

10:33.460 --> 10:37.420
contractors. We're going to write that one down. Concrete contractor. That might be interesting

10:37.420 --> 10:42.940
to write down. Right. And we're going to go back to their site. We're going to check

10:42.940 --> 10:48.860
it out. Okay. Uh, we could look at top rated concrete contracts. I have done this niche

10:48.860 --> 10:51.980
enough to know that's not, but that's something you could look at if you were just going into

10:51.980 --> 10:56.140
the niche things you want to look at on the page is you want to look at, you know, their

10:56.140 --> 10:59.700
service pages. There's, those are going to be the most highly searched terms. So for

10:59.700 --> 11:06.180
example, um, uh, driveway repair could be interesting. I also know like just using my

11:06.180 --> 11:11.260
intuition driveway repair, you know, it's probably going to be more high ticket, uh,

11:11.260 --> 11:14.180
concrete patio. Let's just use that for an example. So I'll, I'll do one more example

11:14.180 --> 11:20.940
and I'm just going to give you my list here. Concrete patio. Okay. Boom. 12.1 thousand.

11:20.940 --> 11:25.260
So guys, and then look, stamped concrete patio. What I want you to first do is I want you

11:25.260 --> 11:30.460
to make a list of 10 to 15 terms that are the most highly searched term in the niche

11:30.460 --> 11:35.520
that you selected. Okay. All right, guys, I went ahead and just grabbed one of my keyword

11:35.520 --> 11:38.800
lists. Uh, I mean, we go into this niche, we're in this niche all over the country.

11:38.800 --> 11:44.040
So I know what keywords are good. Don't mind the highlighted stuff. I'll explain that in

11:44.040 --> 11:50.640
a moment. So this is my compiled list. I did 18 terms. Um, it's not, you know, it's, it's

11:50.640 --> 11:54.400
not a hundred percent complete, but I I've done this enough to know these terms are really,

11:54.400 --> 11:59.360
really good. So I got concrete contractor, concrete company, concrete driveway, and I

11:59.360 --> 12:02.480
just have them listed here. Okay. So what you want to do is you want to have your list.

12:02.480 --> 12:07.080
And by the way, I have this in base camp. Don't recommend this. Um, I just, I'm telling

12:07.080 --> 12:09.960
you that so you don't go and think you need to get base camp. There's something we use

12:09.960 --> 12:14.320
and it's just already in here, but it's not worth the money. Um, I'm telling you that

12:14.320 --> 12:19.240
in fact, we got a free trial of this. And so that's why I'm still using it. Okay. So

12:19.240 --> 12:24.480
what you're going to do is you're going to take your, your, let's call it 10 to 15 keywords.

12:24.480 --> 12:26.880
And then what you're going to do from there is you're going to take, and you're going

12:26.880 --> 12:34.400
to use your intuition and you're going to select five to 10. I prefer like seven being

12:34.400 --> 12:39.000
the sweet spot. You're going to select five to 10 of these keywords closer to five than

12:39.000 --> 12:44.760
10. In fact, I'm just going to tell you, do five top set. Okay. Five to seven of these

12:44.760 --> 12:49.880
keywords. And I'm going to have you use your intuition and say, okay, would that keyword

12:49.880 --> 12:54.800
be something I want to focus on because of, uh, it's high ticket. It's, you know, it's

12:54.800 --> 12:59.480
not someone that's looking around like, for example, uh, conk, cheap concrete near me.

12:59.480 --> 13:04.000
I don't want those leads. That's some cheap ass. I don't want that. Okay. So anyway, I

13:04.000 --> 13:09.880
went ahead and these highlighted ones are the ones that I determined as, you know, they're

13:09.880 --> 13:12.800
really interesting keywords to me. And so what we're going to do is pick those five

13:12.800 --> 13:18.520
to seven and these are going to be what we call core keywords. Okay. So just to recap,

13:18.520 --> 13:22.240
we're going to go in, we're going to pick, or we're going to go find the terms that are

13:22.240 --> 13:27.520
most searched across the nation. Okay. Concrete concrete contractor, concrete company, concrete

13:27.520 --> 13:32.320
driveway, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. From that list of 10 to 15 to 20, we're going

13:32.320 --> 13:37.360
to select five to seven of those keywords. And here's the interesting thing. It's not

13:37.360 --> 13:42.200
always based on the search volume. Cause if you look at the actual total volume, notice

13:42.200 --> 13:48.000
how concrete repair has more volume than a lot of these terms are very similar volume

13:48.000 --> 13:52.240
to some of these terms, yet it didn't make the cut, right? Because I know people looking

13:52.240 --> 13:56.600
for concrete repair. Those are really small jobs. Okay. So you're going to pick those

13:56.600 --> 14:01.220
top terms. Okay. And I didn't include that because I just decorative concrete kind of

14:01.220 --> 14:05.500
goes with polished concrete, but it's, it's didn't, I didn't, I didn't include it. Okay.

14:05.500 --> 14:09.520
And you're going to come up with what are called your core keyword list. Okay. That's

14:09.520 --> 14:16.520
going to be five to seven keywords. Now what you're going to do from here is very simple,

14:16.600 --> 14:23.600
but we're going to build what are called expanded core keyword list for each of these terms.

14:23.600 --> 14:28.800
Okay. So I'm going to tell you the terms that I selected. I selected concrete contractor.

14:28.800 --> 14:33.320
I put, I don't know even know why this, this, in fact, I need to edit that. That shouldn't

14:33.320 --> 14:37.120
even be in there. Concrete specialist should not be in there. In fact, for the sake of

14:37.120 --> 14:43.320
this, let me go ahead and just delete this. Um, that, that was not done by me. Um, yeah,

14:43.320 --> 14:46.760
I don't actually know why that's in there. Okay. There's no volume. It's not a great

14:46.760 --> 14:52.000
term. So just forget you ever saw a concrete specialist. Don't add it. Stupid term. Not

14:52.000 --> 14:56.360
that much volume, not that great of a term. Okay. But here are the core keywords that

14:56.360 --> 15:00.600
I chose. Okay. To build my expanded lists on. And this is all going to make sense. So

15:00.600 --> 15:07.600
just stay with me. Okay. Concrete contractor, concrete company, stamp concrete, concrete

15:07.960 --> 15:14.960
staining, concrete driveway, concrete patio, polished concrete. Okay. I actually did like

15:16.640 --> 15:22.720
eight or nine of these. Um, but I recommend doing seven. I don't, I actually do not use,

15:22.720 --> 15:28.840
um, I can tell you this because we just did a site recently. I don't use these, uh, decorative

15:28.840 --> 15:32.680
concrete terms. They were just built because we, in the beginning we thought we were going

15:32.680 --> 15:37.800
to do that. So something important to note about concrete, there is decorative side and

15:37.800 --> 15:41.800
then there's the flat work side. And most of these people, they want flat work stuff.

15:41.800 --> 15:45.140
So I would, I would err on that side. But what I'm going to show you is you're going

15:45.140 --> 15:48.040
to pick your five to seven terms. If you want to do a couple more, that's totally fine.

15:48.040 --> 15:50.960
It's just going to take you a little bit longer. Guys. So what we're going to do is we're going

15:50.960 --> 15:55.400
to take those five to seven keywords, your core keywords, and we're going to build an

15:55.400 --> 15:59.540
expanded keyword list. Okay. And so what we're going to do is very, very simple. You're going

15:59.540 --> 16:02.900
to take your first term. Okay. So you're going to go over and take your first term

16:02.900 --> 16:06.660
concrete contractor. Okay. You're going to come over here and you're going to type it

16:06.660 --> 16:11.580
into Google. Okay. And then what you're going to do is you're going to scroll the bottom

16:11.580 --> 16:15.540
and you're going to see these related searches and it's going to give you ideas. These are

16:15.540 --> 16:18.860
things people are searching and I want you to use your intuition. Should this be added

16:18.860 --> 16:23.300
to the list or not? So concrete contractor near St. George, Utah. I'm not going to do

16:23.300 --> 16:26.220
that one because I don't even know if I'm going into St. George yet. We're just picking

16:26.220 --> 16:32.660
the niche at this point. So no near Las Vegas. No concrete pouring near me. Maybe. Okay.

16:32.660 --> 16:36.780
Maybe you would add that. Maybe not concrete contractor salary. No, that's going to pull

16:36.780 --> 16:41.140
people looking for jobs. Okay. Residential concrete contract. That's a really good one.

16:41.140 --> 16:43.700
I would add that to my list. Okay. And what you're going to do is you're going to take

16:43.700 --> 16:48.480
that keyword and you're going to go over here and you're going to add it to your list. Okay.

16:48.480 --> 16:52.620
And you guys don't overthink this. Don't overthink this. Okay. Con concrete contractor jobs. No.

16:52.780 --> 16:56.300
Okay. Not doing that one. Concrete calculator. Probably not doing that one. That's probably

16:56.300 --> 17:00.460
somebody looking to do a project themselves. Residential concrete contractors near me.

17:00.460 --> 17:04.180
Yeah, we might, but it's getting a little long tail. So I don't know. Okay. So that's

17:04.180 --> 17:06.620
what you're going to do is you're going to do that with all of your terms and you're

17:06.620 --> 17:10.940
going to start building these individual lists. Another thing that you can do is you can go

17:10.940 --> 17:15.580
and use the alphabet. So you go to concrete contractor. In fact, it typically, let me

17:15.580 --> 17:21.180
go ahead and let go like this and open a new incognito window and do in concrete contractor

17:21.180 --> 17:31.180
actually, let's go to Google first. Okay. We're going to go concrete contractor. Okay.

17:31.180 --> 17:35.860
And then we're going to start with the letter A. Okay. Type in A. Whoops. And you're going

17:35.860 --> 17:39.060
to see, why is it caps? There we go. And you're going to look and see if there's anything

17:39.060 --> 17:44.060
with A. Association? No. Atlanta? No. Aberdeen? No. No. It's a lot of, a lot of city stuff.

17:44.060 --> 17:53.460
So no. Okay. Okay. B. No. A lot of cities. Business plan. Nope. C. Okay. Concrete contractor

17:53.460 --> 17:58.020
contract. No. Cost. Concrete contractor cost. That's an interesting one. I'd add that to

17:58.020 --> 18:02.500
my list. Concrete contractor companies near me. Add that to the list. Okay. I'm still

18:02.500 --> 18:09.900
going to avoid the calculator. We're going to go D. No. No. E. Estimate. I'd probably

18:09.900 --> 18:19.580
add that. Okay. F. Nothing. G. Lot of cities with this term. And you're going to do this

18:19.580 --> 18:25.140
H. Okay. You're just going to keep doing this with every one of your course. You're going

18:25.140 --> 18:27.780
to do this five times all the way through the alphabet. And for whatever reason with

18:27.780 --> 18:32.340
concrete contractor, you're going to kind of get a lot of cities, but let's try and

18:32.340 --> 18:38.620
change the term. Let's do concrete patio and let's go A. Okay. Now you can see there's

18:38.620 --> 18:45.880
a lot less cities. So A. Alternatives. Probably not. Around window well. No. Against house.

18:45.880 --> 18:48.860
Probably around pool. I'll probably add that one. Depending on where you're at. Right?

18:48.860 --> 18:52.180
If you're in somewhere that doesn't have pools, like where I grew up, don't do that. Okay.

18:52.180 --> 18:56.820
It's not going to be a good one. Concrete patio and fire pit. Maybe. Okay. B. Concrete

18:56.820 --> 19:00.300
patio blocks. And you're just going to go through and you're going to just use your

19:00.300 --> 19:04.060
intuition. You're going to grab the ones that make sense. Concrete patio backyard. What

19:04.660 --> 19:11.660
you would search for as a consumer, as a customer that would be interesting? C. Cost. I think

19:11.660 --> 19:16.380
we talked about that one. Yes. Concrete patio contractors near me. Yes. Concrete patio contractors.

19:16.380 --> 19:23.380
Yes. Concrete patio cleaner. No. Concrete patio square foot. Maybe. But probably not.

19:23.500 --> 19:27.380
Concrete patio coatings. Yes. Go to D. And you guys, you're just going to go through.

19:27.380 --> 19:31.500
So to recap, you're going to go through all of your five core keywords. You're going to

19:31.660 --> 19:34.860
type it in. You're going to, you know, for patio, you're going to first go to the bottom.

19:34.860 --> 19:40.420
You're going to look at related. You're going to grab the related block. Heck no, Google.

19:40.420 --> 19:42.980
You're going to look at the related. You're going to add those to the list. And then you're

19:42.980 --> 19:47.260
going to do the alphabet game. You're going to go A through whatever with the term. So

19:47.260 --> 19:52.820
concrete patio space. Okay. Concrete patio space in every letter of the alphabet. And

19:52.820 --> 19:55.940
look at the auto fill suggestions. And what you're going to do is you're going to build

19:55.940 --> 20:01.340
out these expanded keyword lists. And guys, if you get the keyword, the core keywords

20:01.340 --> 20:05.660
dialed in and you then expand the keyword list, you're going to be off to a great start.

20:05.660 --> 20:10.660
You're going to be able to use this keyword list over and over and over. So guys, to recap,

20:10.660 --> 20:14.820
what you're going to do is you are going to go and pick a tool. Okay. If you don't want

20:14.820 --> 20:20.420
to spend money, do Google keyword, Google keyword planner. I think that's what it's

20:20.420 --> 20:24.380
called. Okay. Pick a tool and stick with that tool. Then you're going to go and you're going

20:24.420 --> 20:29.820
to type in the main term. And from there, you're going to start building a list of 10

20:29.820 --> 20:35.460
to 15 to 20 core keywords. Things that people, they're the most highly searched thing based

20:35.460 --> 20:40.860
on what this tool tells you. Okay. From that list, you are then going to pick five to seven

20:40.860 --> 20:45.980
core keywords. From those core keywords, you are going to build an expanded list on each

20:45.980 --> 20:50.160
of those keywords. And you're going to do it by first typing it into Google and looking

20:50.240 --> 20:54.680
at the very bottom at the related keywords and then going to Google and typing in the

20:54.680 --> 21:00.920
keyword, pushing space and then the letter A and then looking at those automatic fills.

21:00.920 --> 21:04.040
Hey, do any of these make sense? You're going to do that for every single letter of the

21:04.040 --> 21:07.800
alphabet for all five to seven keywords. I know it sounds like a lot. I know that, but

21:07.800 --> 21:11.840
guys, if you do this once and you do it correctly for concrete, you're never going to have to

21:11.840 --> 21:16.440
do this. If you do 15 concrete sites, a hundred concrete sites, you will never have to do

21:16.440 --> 21:21.360
this again. So it's worth doing and doing correctly. And I want to say this last thing.

21:21.360 --> 21:26.720
Do not overthink this. Do not overthink this. Remember our goal is to go into cities and

21:26.720 --> 21:32.840
niches with low competition. So even if we do this 75% correctly, we're going to win.

21:32.840 --> 21:36.600
But I'm telling you, if you do this correctly and you take the time, it is going to help

21:36.600 --> 21:39.520
you immensely. And you're going to be able to use this keyword for your ads. You're going

21:39.520 --> 21:43.680
to be able to use this keyword list for your ad copy. You're going to be able to use it

21:43.720 --> 21:48.840
for your SEO, for your content. It is worth doing and doing correctly. And you only got

21:48.840 --> 21:49.840
to do it once.
