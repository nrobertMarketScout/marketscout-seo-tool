1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,960
Oh. All right, guys.

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,040
And when I say guys, I think there's only one person on.

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,800
It's cool. It's good to have Hustler 80.

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,160
It says love is breaking.

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,000
I don't know if that means live is breaking. Oh, great.

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,560
Well, let's just try it.

7
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,640
Let's just try to do it, Zach.

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,760
It is what it is. It's it's live, dude.

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,960
That's the point. It's supposed to break.

10
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:27,400
It's at least you guys know, completely polished.

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,040
So we're we have four people watching.

12
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:35,640
If you are on this live right now, I'd love to hear just comment on it.

13
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,640
Just say something. You can say that.

14
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:41,040
Say, what's up? Say you can hear me just so I know who's on.

15
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,600
The funny thing about YouTube is it's a username.

16
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,680
So we got like Hustler 80.

17
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,480
You got all kinds of different names, but I'll call you guys by your name.

18
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,800
So we're just going to jump in.

19
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,200
I want to get I wanted Zach to get on this call today.

20
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,480
If you guys don't know who I am,

21
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,400
go watch some of the other YouTube videos that we put out.

22
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,720
I've been doing this business model of building simple websites,

23
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,440
ranking them on Google and renting them out for almost nine years.

24
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,120
Lost a bunch of money, made a bunch of money.

25
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,120
But I think it's one of the best business models on the Internet.

26
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,840
OK, I want to bring Zach on

27
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,040
because Zach does things a little bit differently.

28
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,320
Zach is somebody that I started working with like,

29
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,440
I think it was like two and a half years ago.

30
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,600
And he he needed to get out of his job.

31
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,840
He needed to replace the income from his job.

32
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,680
And Zach, at that time, you're making like six thousand gross, right?

33
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,360
After taxes, my job, I'd bring home like forty six hundred.

34
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,600
So, yeah. OK.

35
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,040
So he's making forty six.

36
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,720
The taxes are crazy.

37
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,040
It's making forty six hundred bucks a month.

38
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,760
But he's like, I need to get that replaced as soon as possible

39
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,200
so I can keep building my dream.

40
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,480
And many of you guys are in that same situation

41
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:58,040
where you want to do digital real estate, you want to do something online,

42
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:03,840
but you need to get that initial jail be nine to five, whatever it is.

43
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,200
Maybe it's even a business.

44
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,400
It's just not bringing in a lot of money.

45
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:11,480
You need to get that income replaced so you can then focus on other things

46
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,520
like building digital real estate.

47
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,360
So I want to bring Zach on because I've realized that sometimes people need,

48
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,960
you know, different ways out of the the rat race.

49
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,680
They want to get out.

50
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,400
And I think the best thing you can do as quickly as you can get out

51
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,080
is the method that you should take.

52
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,920
And so Zach has found this really, really interesting way

53
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,480
of of selling simple SEO services

54
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,760
where he has been able to scale.

55
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,840
Zach, are all of your deals, your fifty eight thousand dollars per month,

56
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,480
is that one hundred percent SEO?

57
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,280
I have one lead client.

58
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,520
For five hundred a month, everything else is SEO.

59
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,120
Yeah, that's crazy, bro.

60
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,160
I'll buy it from you.

61
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,080
We'll talk later.

62
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,760
So OK, so fifty seven.

63
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,640
I missed fifty seven thousand five hundred dollars all from selling simple SEO.

64
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,720
And I'm I'm I'm enunciating and I'm putting the emphasis on the simple

65
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,440
because Zach's strategy is very unique when I and the reason

66
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,640
I was a big you guys watched me for a long time, I was a big hater of SEO

67
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,920
services because I did it wrong and I tried to go land a bunch of big clients.

68
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,680
I had clients cancel on me.

69
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,840
I had this really bad experience and I was like, no, don't do it.

70
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,800
Don't do it.

71
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,800
And then Zach started scaling and I was like, well, obviously

72
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,320
he knows something that I don't.

73
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,280
Let's take a look.

74
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,360
And so we hopped on the phone and I realized, oh, he's doing this very, very differently.

75
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,840
So Zach does this in such a way, guys,

76
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,880
that he doesn't put himself at risk of like losing a bunch of business.

77
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:47,920
The other thing is he has his team that he's built doing this for him.

78
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:53,480
And on top of that, he actually has if he were to go in right now today into his.

79
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,960
Let's call it 50.

80
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,120
Let's call it because your deals are smaller.

81
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,960
So you probably have close to 100 clients, right?

82
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,800
Yeah, there's like a hundred and seventy some hundred and seventy.

83
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,080
You do like really small.

84
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,600
So, guys, you've got this business brick by brick, right?

85
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,280
Well, imagine he goes to half of those clients

86
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,400
and pitches them on a lead generation deal.

87
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,600
He's got a ton of money sitting on the table.

88
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,080
And so you can do this in a really strategic way.

89
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,240
Excuse me, that I have never seen done before.

90
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:30,000
So as a way to just add value to you guys and to show you guys

91
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,440
something a little bit different, I want to bring Zach on, talk about his overall strategy.

92
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,800
And then also the other reason I like talking about this is because SEO

93
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,600
is a part of what we are doing inside of lead generation,

94
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,600
inside of digital real estate, inside of ranking.

95
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,360
We have to rank the website at some point, whether you do it at the beginning

96
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,480
or you do what I do, you sell it and then rank it.

97
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,560
You have to do the ranking part to complete the process.

98
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,720
So Zach just happened to focus on the ranking of other people's websites.

99
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,960
So, Zach, welcome to call, man.

100
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,840
Let's just get into it.

101
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,400
I know you you've got we've got like twenty five minutes

102
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,680
and then you got to hop off.

103
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,960
And I think that's perfect.

104
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,080
So kind of explain to everyone.

105
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,160
High level, what it is that you do, like the type of clients that you have.

106
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,800
And then maybe we can talk about your process from like,

107
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,440
like, again, like a ten thousand foot view.

108
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,880
And then if people, you know, want to check more of your stuff out,

109
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,720
whenever we can let them know.

110
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,960
But just I want to inspire people that there's you can get your life

111
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,600
can change in a matter of 12 months.

112
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,320
And so let's let's just start there and let's talk about

113
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:35,640
let's talk about what you actually do, your business does.

114
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,800
Yeah, so pretty simple.

115
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,400
I started out actually 100 percent focused on lead gen,

116
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,480
building sites, ranking those sites.

117
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,480
That's why I still have a client like that I've had for years.

118
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,200
And then I realized there was this opportunity

119
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,680
because my dad owns a carpet cleaning company where

120
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,280
I built his website and ranked that well.

121
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,040
And then his friends wanted me to build their websites.

122
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,840
And it was the same skill set.

123
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,960
And I was like, man, I could see the path to quit my job

124
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,160
if I just stacked these easy website builds plus SEO clients.

125
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,040
So that's what I started doing.

126
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,400
I already knew how to build the websites.

127
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,960
I already knew how to rank the sites.

128
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,520
Now, instead of building my own sites and putting the money into that

129
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:30,280
to then land the deals later, I would just go

130
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,640
make money day one, which I liked.

131
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,560
I would just go get the deal.

132
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,840
They pay me day one.

133
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:40,400
Then my team and I build the website and help it rank.

134
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,600
And they just keep paying us every month.

135
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,720
And it was low stress because I would start out, just charge

136
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,680
three hundred to five hundred bucks a month per client

137
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,120
and just stack those clients is easy wins, easy wins, easy wins

138
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,720
until I was able to quit my job quickly.

139
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,360
Like, I started doing that

140
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,360
about four or six months later, quit my job,

141
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,400
and then just grew it a much more from there.

142
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,880
But it's essentially the same concept you talk about all the time.

143
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:12,040
I just tweaked it where I didn't own the site.

144
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:16,240
They own the site and they just pay me each month to build it and improve it.

145
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,680
And that's how I got the easy wins

146
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,560
because I needed the fast, easy wins to to quit my job.

147
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:28,040
And so that's that's the route I took and it's worked really well.

148
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,640
And then from there, you know, build the systems to get more sales faster,

149
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,400
more websites, build faster and just build it up.

150
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,600
So that's kind of the high level overview.

151
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,360
I want to go into questions I know everyone's asking.

152
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,600
Number one, does it worry you?

153
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,400
By the way, I've asked you these questions.

154
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,480
So I know you're going to be like, do I ask this again?

155
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,040
But from somebody that's just hearing you,

156
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,760
does it not worry you that your clients have the control

157
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,320
where they can just cancel at any point?

158
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,600
Why doesn't that worry you or does it worry you?

159
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,360
How are you kind of like hedging your bet against that?

160
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,400
Yeah, that's a great question.

161
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,200
Business owners need a website

162
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,600
and they need someone they can trust.

163
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,840
Most business owners, they're too busy

164
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,840
doing plumbing or electrical work or cleaning carpets.

165
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,680
They don't have the time and they don't want to worry about their online,

166
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,560
their website, their stuff online.

167
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,320
So they know they need a website.

168
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,200
They know they're going to get the website will pay for itself.

169
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:36,480
And if it ranks better, it's going to weigh more than 10x pay for itself.

170
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,280
As we'll go on Google, people just like when they need their carpet

171
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,160
cleaned, when they need a plumber, they're just going to Google it.

172
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:47,560
So business owners, they know they need a website.

173
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,800
And they're going to pay someone for that.

174
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,760
So it might as well be me, right?

175
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:01,360
Very rarely do I lose clients because as long as they're in business,

176
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,040
I've had, I've lost some clients where the guy's like, hey, I'm retiring.

177
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,400
I'm not selling the business.

178
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,200
I'm not, my son doesn't want to take it over.

179
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,280
The business is done.

180
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,840
And it's like, okay, now the website, you know, I lost that client,

181
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:17,080
but man, that's so rare because people are going to be in business

182
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:22,040
for five, 10, 15, 20, 30 years, and they need a website.

183
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:30,200
But it's, it's a pretty solid business model where when you explain things

184
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,440
well, people trust you and they just know like you're their go-to guy.

185
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:43,720
Um, now for these hundreds of businesses and they're like, oh yeah, it's just

186
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,080
like, it's a monthly expense.

187
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,080
It's like my phone bill.

188
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,160
It's like my TV subscription.

189
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,120
It's like my website.

190
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,120
It's just like, it's just a subscription that is mandatory for their company.

191
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,720
And that's why I love it.

192
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,240
Even if, you know, money's tight and they're like, Hey, um, we don't really,

193
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,760
we can't really afford this.

194
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,120
They're still going to have it up.

195
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,520
And there's, you know, I might give them a reduced package, but they're

196
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,880
still going to be with me because they need that website.

197
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,560
They realize it's critical.

198
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,200
So that's, that's why I like it.

199
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,520
So essentially guys, Zach's using his brain.

200
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:23,640
He's targeting people who are already planning on and used to spending that money.

201
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:24,720
Right.

202
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,920
If you've watched any amount of my content on this channel, I always talk

203
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,160
about go after business owners who are already paying for leads.

204
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,400
Why?

205
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,760
Because they don't need to be sold.

206
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,360
You don't need to convince them to spend money on leads.

207
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,480
They already believe in the concept and the idea of spending money on leads.

208
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,040
You just need to show them that your leads, your, uh, services are better

209
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,680
than home advisor angels, whatever.

210
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:56,560
So Zach, um, explain to everybody, cause you had a very similar experience

211
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,960
as I did doing door-to-door sales, by the way, Zach did door-to-door sales.

212
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:05,600
He sold a dish network and I wanted to tell you why he stumbled into this

213
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,960
idea of selling to people that were already using the service, but I also

214
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:13,560
want before he does that before anyone goes, oh my gosh, I, uh, I have

215
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,680
to have sales experience.

216
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,760
That's why these guys are, are no, no, no, no guys.

217
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:23,760
We, we, we just happened to do door-to-door sales, but we've seen, I

218
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,000
would say at this point over a hundred or hundreds of people that have taken

219
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,080
what we teach and without any sales experience and it made a ton of money.

220
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:39,000
In fact, um, Zach and I were just barely on a live like an hour ago with somebody

221
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,040
that had zero sales experience.

222
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,960
He's making $44,000 a month.

223
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,680
Did Vinny have any sales experience?

224
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,200
None.

225
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:47,920
No.

226
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,440
Okay.

227
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,720
So I just want to say that because I know that's what everybody's thinking.

228
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,320
Oh, it's cause they have sales experience.

229
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,240
No, we're, we're the anomaly.

230
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:59,320
So why should people, why should people target, target, uh, well, not why should

231
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,600
they cause everyone knows that, but what made you decide to start targeting

232
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,320
these kinds of people?

233
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,880
It makes so much sense, dude.

234
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,960
But when I was doing SEO, what I was doing is I was trying to target everybody.

235
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,400
Right.

236
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,280
I was like, well, I know this person has a business.

237
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,520
Let me see if I was pitching these deals where I had to convince them.

238
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,760
They needed, they needed SEO and they needed to use me.

239
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,680
And it was like such an uphill battle.

240
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,960
And then even when you got the deal, the first thing that went wrong, they were

241
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,880
getting ready to cancel the service because they weren't used to paying that bill.

242
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,440
So just tell everyone how you discovered that.

243
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,000
And, uh, I mean, it's genius.

244
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,840
And, and if you're doing it, Legion, if you're doing door to door alarms, door

245
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:42,360
to door TV, if you're selling SEO, you should freaking follow what Zach's about to say.

246
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:49,960
Yeah, this is like the golden nugget for me that finally clicked and everything

247
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,480
went buck wild, essentially.

248
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,880
I realized when I was in college and I was selling door to door, um, I was just

249
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:03,280
getting people to switch from dish network to direct TV or Comcast or AT&T U

250
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:06,040
verse, whatever they had, I would just get them to switch.

251
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,560
I never watched TV.

252
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:14,560
Like I didn't care about TV at all, but I knew that I could rebundle people's

253
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,560
packages or I could switch them over.

254
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,400
And they would go from paying $150 a month to 70.

255
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,320
I would cut their bill in half and they would get the same channels

256
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,000
plus NFL Sunday ticket, right?

257
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,560
And so like they're getting more for half the money.

258
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,840
And it was so easy.

259
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:36,200
I would just, I would make about 250 or $300 a sale and get like three sales

260
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:40,880
a day on average as a college student for a hundred days, I ended up making

261
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:47,520
like 70,000 in three or four months doing this and the whole idea was if

262
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:52,640
someone didn't have a TV subscription already, I would never make that sale

263
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:56,480
because you got to sell them on paying 70 bucks a month when they're spending

264
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,960
zero, that's a tough sale, but I could sell people, I would just sell savings.

265
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,520
I would, I would transfer people and save them money all day long.

266
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:11,520
So then I entered this same thing.

267
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,200
And that's what I figured out, right?

268
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:19,920
People that are already paying a company, a big marketing company, whoever,

269
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:25,640
their local dude, they're paying yellow pages, they're paying whatever for their

270
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:30,360
online presence, their website, they're paying, um, I don't know, Yelp, people

271
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,200
pay, Angelo's people pay for their websites, people pay all sorts of stuff

272
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:34,760
online, right?

273
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:43,920
I would just find people who are paying for SEO and give them a better offer for

274
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,080
the same price or a lower price.

275
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:50,840
And people would just switch to me all day, same concept.

276
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:57,120
And that's how I built, um, my whole company is just giving people a better

277
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:57,760
experience.

278
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,480
They're already used to studying the money, but why not get more bang for your

279
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:06,520
buck and just start paying me instead of these other guys that don't care, don't

280
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:10,320
know what they're talking about, aren't attentive to the details, don't have good

281
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,720
systems built like, man, I'm just going to serve those people all day long.

282
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,200
And it makes the sales easy and it makes your growth predictable.

283
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:22,320
You're just like, of course I can add five, 10, 15 new clients a month.

284
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:27,680
Um, because everyone I talked to wants to do this.

285
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,520
They're already paid just like direct TV.

286
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,600
They're already paying one 50.

287
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,440
They might as well pay 70 and get more with me.

288
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,920
Oh, they're already paying 500.

289
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,960
They might as well pay 500 with me, but get a way better website, a new built,

290
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,120
newly built website.

291
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,240
It's going to rank better.

292
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,000
I'm going to do their Google business profile stuff, which isn't being done.

293
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,960
Like there's going to get a better service than they have for the same price.

294
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:52,000
It's a no brainer and you just win people over all day long.

295
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,520
So that's how I think about it.

296
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,480
Makes sense.

297
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,080
And it's the same.

298
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,280
I had the same experience.

299
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:01,280
I won't bore everyone, but I had a very similar experience.

300
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:06,680
And that's why I always preach and say, target people that are already sold period.

301
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,040
Um, real quick, before we keep going, um, hustler 80 says, Zach is

302
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,560
selling low ticket SEO services.

303
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,640
I thought SEO was around 1500 a month.

304
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:20,800
Can you clarify if he is selling low ticket to get them to buy more services from you?

305
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:26,160
So in hustler eighties mind, that's he's never heard of SEO being that cheap.

306
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,880
Can you clarify exactly what you're offering?

307
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,440
Which, uh, I think is a good question by the way.

308
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:33,520
Yeah.

309
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,200
Great question.

310
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,160
A lot of people charge way more.

311
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,840
My expenses are lower than those companies because I have international people

312
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,880
working for me, um, which is awesome.

313
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:48,400
And so our profit margin is insanely high because our costs are low and

314
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,560
we deliver a great service.

315
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:54,040
But yes, we build websites and do their SEO and their Google business profile

316
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:59,880
optimization, usually for like around 500 bucks a month, some clients are more if

317
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:05,320
we're doing additional things and yes, we can then upsell them to, um, other

318
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:10,080
things that we offer, um, Facebook ads, like we've added other things on over

319
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:18,840
time, um, but it's those easy wins and then they stay with you forever because

320
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:23,560
you do a good job and you're like a great price and then you make great

321
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:29,520
money because you're smart and have international talent that, um, is

322
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:34,480
phenomenal and not as expensive as, as expensive as us labor.

323
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,200
So great question.

324
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:43,120
It's a business model that works super, super well because, um, most SEO

325
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,960
companies charging 1500, 2000, 5,000, they see a lot of churn.

326
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,200
I just have a lot less churn.

327
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,320
People are with me for years and years and years.

328
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,120
And I just, I just had a thought, bro.

329
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:59,480
It's kind of like what's, and this is to answer your question,

330
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,120
um, Hunter or hustler eight.

331
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,240
It's kind of like insurance, right?

332
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,280
So you, I'm sure everyone's act.

333
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,280
Have you ever been pitched on whole life insurance?

334
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:10,880
Yeah.

335
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:11,320
Okay.

336
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,080
Everybody has, right?

337
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,800
It's like everyone pitches whole life insurance because the insurance

338
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,800
guys get paid crazy commissions.

339
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,040
Basically whole life insurance.

340
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,160
There's a bunch of perks.

341
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,560
You can, you can take out a loan against it.

342
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,360
You can all kinds of different stuff, right?

343
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:28,240
There's that, which is what everyone wants to target because they get these

344
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,400
big commissions and these big jobs, whatever.

345
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:35,560
And Zach's basically the guy that's like, Hey, you guys can go and chase all that.

346
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:38,240
You guys can go fight over all the whole life insurance deals.

347
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,560
I'm going to go target everyone that has life insurance, just a policy, a term

348
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,240
policy, which is 50, 60, 70 bucks a month.

349
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,040
Why?

350
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:52,080
Because I know for me personally, I have a policy with Northwestern mutual.

351
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,200
That's like 50 bucks a month.

352
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,360
I've been paying for it since 2018.

353
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,160
I don't touch it.

354
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,000
I don't think about it.

355
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
It's just a bill that is, and I will always keep Zach would be the person

356
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,960
would come along and say, Hey, I know you already have term.

357
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:07,480
Let me show you how I can, you can work with me and it's a better option.

358
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,920
And I've already, I'm used to this bill.

359
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,600
He's not selling me on this additional bill.

360
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,800
He's just targeting people like me that already have term.

361
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:18,880
He's going for those low ticket, set it and forget it bills that are just a bill.

362
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:24,760
And he's just figured out a way to use international talent, AKA VA is to go

363
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:29,000
scrape the internet, find a whole bunch of people that have it go and, and sell

364
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,880
them on using his service, put him into, put them into his system and rinse and

365
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:37,760
repeat, is that, is that a pretty decent way of describing it or is that my way off?

366
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,120
Yeah, man, you nailed it.

367
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:48,200
Um, and the other thought there is like, you're building durable revenue.

368
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,920
That's what I love about this business model is it's a subscription.

369
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:59,120
Most businesses, service businesses, they got to go out and like earn

370
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,920
the next dollar every day with this.

371
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,960
It's like, you have a recurring client base that trusts you and likes you.

372
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:12,560
And that creates the foundation, but then, yeah, as you build your company,

373
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,840
you can upsell to other things.

374
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:18,640
And then it's like, you have no sales cost.

375
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:24,560
It's like all of a sudden, boom, you upsell them on Facebook ads or on, um,

376
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,720
your CRM system on, you know, whatever you want to offer in the future.

377
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,240
And you have these clients that trust you, you're in the door.

378
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:36,360
You got that easy win and you can stack that and make an amazing company.

379
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,000
And then if you want to crush it even further, like we're doing is like, cool.

380
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,760
Now these people that trust us, when they ask about whatever, boom, we can fulfill

381
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:48,120
that need and we grow with those clients and it's pretty phenomenal.

382
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:52,120
I think the hardest thing is getting the first deal.

383
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:55,960
That's why there are less entrepreneurs in the world than there could be is

384
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,640
people don't get like that first deal.

385
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:01,200
And so you want the bar, the barrier of entry in my mind.

386
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,680
I was like, how can I lower that bar?

387
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:08,880
So I'm going for the easiest wins possible to start stacking the money.

388
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,760
And that's how I quit my job.

389
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,520
And now we just keep stacking and then we stack and expand.

390
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:18,560
And that's how we build the empire is little by little easy wins.

391
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,800
Boom, that expand.

392
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:23,640
Cause now you have the trust and easy upsells wherever you want.

393
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,040
So.

394
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,320
Amazing.

395
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,040
Um, another question, what strategies do you recommend for attracting and

396
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:35,040
retaining clients in the competitive field of websites?

397
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:40,080
Well, first, just to clarify, this is the, we're not, I, if Zach reached

398
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,640
it out to somebody and they do have a crappy website or they need a website,

399
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:47,920
he'll offer it, but he's targeting people that are paying that monthly fee.

400
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:52,440
And maybe working in that, uh, that website as part of it is not just

401
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:57,440
targeting people that just need a website as a one-time bill, but I get your question.

402
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,320
So Zach, what are, what are some strategies that you recommend?

403
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,320
By the way, I dropped this already.

404
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,160
I'll drop it again.

405
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,840
If you guys want to check out more of what Zach's up to, he actually does

406
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:13,320
have, uh, some stuff that he, that he trains and you can check it out on

407
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:17,800
this website where he goes over like his A to Z process, but for the sake of

408
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:22,480
this call, what, what are some strategies that you use to attract or reach out

409
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,320
to those people that you want to target those easy wins?

410
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:33,480
Yeah, I love this question because the gears are turning, right?

411
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,600
And I think the biggest obstacle is irrelevance.

412
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,520
People don't know that you exist.

413
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:46,080
There's millions of business owners that if they knew you had the skills and knew

414
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:52,520
who you were and knew your price, they would go with you, but you are, you,

415
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:57,480
they don't know you, you are invisible in their minds, right?

416
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,320
So the biggest thing is just contacts.

417
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,720
I've used cold outreach a ton.

418
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:08,120
I have teams in the Philippines that call business owners and they

419
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,600
just find people that are unhappy.

420
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,920
Do they have accents?

421
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,080
Yeah, a little bit, but that's fine.

422
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,760
They're finding people who are unhappy with their current situation.

423
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,800
They set them up for my closers or used to be me.

424
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,480
They set up the appointment for me.

425
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,800
I talked with that business owner who I already know is unhappy with

426
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,840
their online presence, their website.

427
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,840
They're unhappy and that's an easy win.

428
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,520
So in the beginning I would do the, I would do the cold calls.

429
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,360
You know, I would just call business owners and talk with them.

430
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:43,560
The thing is just asking them questions and digging in when they answer the

431
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,360
phone to start a conversation.

432
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,040
Hey, see that you're in this area.

433
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,880
Um, I help companies.

434
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,120
I live local, whatever.

435
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,600
Um, what are your thoughts on like how you guys are doing online?

436
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,080
What are your thoughts on your website?

437
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,000
What do you guys want to do better?

438
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,840
Do you guys want to grow?

439
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:01,840
And if you start having conversations, it can be over the phone.

440
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:07,200
Um, it can be over email, but just learning about companies.

441
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,080
Now they know that you're even an option.

442
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,400
So I think that's to answer your question.

443
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,680
What strategies do you recommend for attracting and retaining to

444
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,640
attract, they need to know you.

445
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,600
So you need to do way more outreach.

446
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:23,320
You need to, if you're talking with five companies a day and not having much

447
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:28,960
success, go talk with 20 comp, 20 business owners a day, and it's

448
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,280
just a numbers game, right?

449
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:34,160
If more people know about you and know what you do, you'll get better at reaching

450
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:34,400
out.

451
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,680
So your conversion rates will get higher and higher over time, but

452
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,720
we'll even know that you're an option.

453
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:50,200
The biggest thing is it's like irrelevance or, um, not even knowing

454
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,240
about you, right?

455
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,400
You need to be known.

456
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,400
So you need to do outreach every day.

457
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:58,600
You or your team calling business owners, emailing business owners,

458
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,520
reaching out and Facebook groups, however you want to reach out.

459
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,720
I don't care, but you need to talk with people.

460
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,960
You need to care about them.

461
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,880
You need to listen to them.

462
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,200
And if they feel heard, then they'll listen to you.

463
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,920
First, you listen to them.

464
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,760
You understand them.

465
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,760
And then you're able to say, Hey, here are my recommendations based on what I

466
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,480
saw and what I found with your website and your online presence.

467
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,640
Here's what I recommend.

468
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
What's your current situation?

469
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,800
How much are you currently paying for everything online?

470
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,160
Oh, we pay this for this.

471
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:25,840
We pay this for this.

472
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,600
We pay this for this.

473
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,720
Okay, cool.

474
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:28,920
What if we do this?

475
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,640
Let's do this all way better for this price.

476
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,680
We'll start here.

477
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:36,240
Uh, once we know that down, we'll then work on your ads and we'll do this.

478
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,960
And boom, now you have another client.

479
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:45,320
So, I mean, a lot of cold outreach, if you join, you can join local BNI groups,

480
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:49,680
you can do whatever, but you just need to be talking and connecting with business

481
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,160
owners on a consistent basis.

482
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,120
And then your growth is automatic.

483
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:01,880
And one other thing too, just as I think I mentioned at the beginning, the thing

484
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:06,200
that you can be very, you can do is you can be very strategic too, at the type

485
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:11,280
of clients, the type of businesses that you actually go after and you work with.

486
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:15,400
So if your goal, you're on this channel, your goal is to actually own

487
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,200
assets and to rent them out.

488
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,360
That's great.

489
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:24,240
Go and get a handful, go get 20 clients that pay you 500 bucks a month.

490
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,600
You have a $10,000, $10,000 per month.

491
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,040
Your margins are going to be ridiculously high.

492
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,640
You're probably going to be making 9,000 of that or 8,000 of that.

493
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:37,680
Even if you have a VA and you can go now to these 20 clients and go and sell them

494
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,480
lead generation services on the backend.

495
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:45,080
So if you have a bunch of clients in the concrete space or the duct cleaning

496
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:50,000
space or the masonry space, et cetera, you can now go and you can sell them a

497
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,120
lead gen as well on that note.

498
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:59,200
What I was going to ask you is, shoot, I had a question regarding that.

499
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:09,040
Oh, uh, I guess one of their thought, one other thought I'll add to that is like

500
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:13,400
over time you'll get a better and better at reaching out.

501
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:19,960
Now I have very targeted campaigns to reach out to, you know, people that are

502
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,920
already paying big marketing companies and I'll get lists of big marketing

503
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,520
companies and we'll target those people.

504
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,320
Find unhappy ones, switch them over, switch them over.

505
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:33,800
I'll find people that are local to where I live in certain niches that I like to

506
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,920
work with, you know, maybe it's like HVAC companies are good.

507
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,560
Maybe I have experienced cleaning carpets.

508
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,960
My dad owns a carpet cleaning company.

509
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,880
I'm able to speak that language really well.

510
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,080
I'm going to pull a list of local carpet cleaners in Arizona where I live.

511
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,760
And now we have connections that those are easy wins.

512
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:54,360
So think about your strengths and think about how you can get easy

513
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,880
wins and easy switches to you.

514
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:00,520
And you'll just stack a monthly recurring revenue.

515
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:06,240
The other thing about SEO is every single person on this planet that owns

516
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:14,720
a business you can sell to right at the right price, you can sell SEO to anybody.

517
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,120
And I'm not saying that you should, but you could sell SEO to the person that

518
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:24,000
owns this company that makes these water bottles or the person that cleans this

519
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,480
office, you know, with lead generation, you have to be a lot more targeted.

520
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:33,360
So it is nice because anybody that you talk to, even if let's say you, you, you

521
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:38,760
find somebody, you can sell them SEO, but it's a really competitive city.

522
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:43,360
It doesn't matter because as long as you charge enough money for that SEO,

523
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,840
you're you it's still money.

524
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,360
Um, so anyway, that's number one.

525
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,400
Number two is I remember when I was going to ask you real quick, and I know you

526
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,880
got to get off for a second, but what is your pro on an average client?

527
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,920
What's your profit margin?

528
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,840
Let's say you make it 500 bucks a month gross.

529
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,840
How much of that are you putting in your pocket out of your 58,000 a month?

530
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,440
How much of that is, is actual profit?

531
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,600
So, yeah, great question.

532
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:14,720
In the beginning, it was a lot higher, um, because I was doing the sales.

533
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,240
I was, um, involved in the business more.

534
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,360
It was like 70 or 80% profit margin.

535
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:27,440
Now, um, I have like an SDR team, a sales team, um, website building team, SEO

536
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,360
team, everything's built and just runs.

537
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:35,480
Um, you know, I have the support team, everything is just dialed in, um, day

538
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:40,240
to day, there's not honestly a ton for me to do except new things that I want to

539
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:45,480
implement margin is like 30, 40%.

540
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:54,000
Um, so, and on top of that, we cross sell our clients to other businesses with

541
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,680
high profit margins, more like the 70, 80% profit margins.

542
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:01,640
Um, so yeah, it's a pretty good, pretty good system.

543
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:08,680
If you, by the way, last thing I want to say, uh, hustler 80, for example,

544
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:13,000
if you were to go and build a business right now of 20 clients, 500 bucks a

545
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,800
month average client, you were going to do all the work.

546
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,840
You could probably have 90% profit margins.

547
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,800
Like that's not unrealistic.

548
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,080
You wouldn't be doing the work.

549
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,280
You wouldn't be doing the updates on the websites, but that'd be manageable.

550
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,840
Once you start to scale, you're going to have to bring on people.

551
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,920
You're going to have to put in systems.

552
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,200
You're going to have to do some of these things.

553
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,920
And as you scale, your profits going to go down, but you're also scaling.

554
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,640
And, and I know Zach, for example, he doesn't have to do a lot of

555
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,520
the actual work himself.

556
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:44,760
So anyway, Zach has got to jump onto another call here in three minutes.

557
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,440
I'm going to let him go.

558
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:50,680
But guys, if you want to check out more of what Zach's up to, go to Zach pile.co.

559
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,040
I dropped it a couple of times in the chat.

560
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,360
Hustler 80s had got his grade.

561
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:57,080
I've been searching for SEO coach like Zach, and here he is live right on my

562
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,320
break at work on a crazy coincidence.

563
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,400
Either that's crazy or this guy's messing with us, but either way, that's cool.

564
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:07,880
He might just, he might be feeding us, but, um, yeah, hustler 80 reach out to Zach.

565
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,360
Maybe mention that your username is hustler 80.

566
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,160
Appreciate you being on.

567
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,960
Appreciate everybody being on guys.

568
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,160
See your 20, 25, get out of the rat race.

569
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,760
It's God didn't put you on this earth to just be under someone's thumb.

570
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,400
Get your freedom and live the life you want to live.

571
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,440
Zach, thanks for being on the call.

572
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,720
We'll see you guys when I go live again.

573
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,240
Thanks man.

574
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,440
Thanks Nick.
