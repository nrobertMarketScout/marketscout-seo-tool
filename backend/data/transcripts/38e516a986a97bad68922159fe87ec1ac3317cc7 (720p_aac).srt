Jeff, do you suggest creating a new email to create each new account?

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,360
If so, should payments for all those accounts be made with the credit card set up in the MCC?

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:18,320
Okay, so people will tell you that the best practice for with the rank and rent model is yes.

4
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,840
But you can ask Nick, me and some other people that that's not necessary.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:33,600
I just create for me. If I'm running an MCC, I run, I set up a new account and then one campaign

6
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,760
under that for one website. And then I do that again, multiple times, or like on some of them,

7
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:45,280
I'm not even turning it. I just don't want them associated with my MCC. And I just have a basic

8
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:51,280
Google profile and I go in and I add account and I set it up for one website. And then I go add

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,640
account and I set up and I'm kind of running MCC, but it's just all on the right underneath the

10
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,680
little profile circle of yours. So it's not necessary. It doesn't mean I'm not going to get

11
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,240
flagged, but it's just, I don't necessarily need it right now. Yeah. I don't think there's any,

12
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,280
I know in Russ, I think Russ ether over in Australia, when we did a one point,

13
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,240
Oh, we talked a lot about that. I don't know. I don't think it's going to hurt,

14
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,160
but I don't think it's necessary. And so if you want to add that layer, great.

15
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,880
But again, I've never done that and I've never had a problem.
