When you are asked a question when you are explaining something or overcoming an objection

00:06.280 --> 00:13.080
You are not going to give an answer from you. You are going to give an answer from a client

00:13.680 --> 00:17.640
Let me repeat that when you answer an object when somebody asks you a question

00:18.200 --> 00:23.600
Okay, a client asks you a question. Hey, how are you different the home advisor? Hey, how does your pricing work?

00:23.680 --> 00:26.400
Hey, how do you guys do flat fee?

00:27.160 --> 00:33.560
Etc or when you are doing your screencast or you're overcoming an objection, you know is going to come up

00:34.560 --> 00:39.800
Instead of answering it just blah and this is what this is the answer

00:40.120 --> 00:43.520
You're going to take a little bit more time and you're gonna answer that question

00:44.200 --> 00:51.000
By using a client's answer to answer that question. Okay, that might be a sound a little bit confusing. It's really really simple

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
Okay, let me give you an example

00:53.320 --> 00:58.080
Client asks you you jump on the phone. You're doing your prospecting. You're hooking the business owner

00:58.080 --> 01:03.440
Like we talked about in step three or sorry step four module four

01:03.440 --> 01:07.600
I'm losing my numbers here in module four where you're actually hooking the business owner

01:08.040 --> 01:13.600
You call them they're interested you go through the script and you're kind of at the end and they're one of those people that starts asking

01:13.880 --> 01:18.880
Questions, right they keep asking questions and you're trying to like avoid it, but they keep asking

01:18.880 --> 01:21.800
Okay, so business owner for example, they would say something like

01:22.440 --> 01:23.640
Okay

01:23.640 --> 01:27.880
So tell me real quick before we end this like how are you different than home advisor?

01:27.880 --> 01:31.240
Okay, most of us would start rambling on well

01:32.000 --> 01:36.480
We we don't we don't do shared leads number one, sir

01:37.720 --> 01:39.720
well, I

01:39.880 --> 01:47.580
Mean whatever the 17,000 different reasons and canned responses are we we work exclusively with one company

01:48.580 --> 01:55.020
We make sure the leads are qualified but whatever whatever the reasons are that you give of saying you're different than home advisor

01:56.020 --> 02:01.340
Once you respond they expect you to have a certain response like they know you've been asked

02:01.340 --> 02:03.340
So when you say it it is what it is

02:03.700 --> 02:06.740
But here's what you're gonna do is instead of answering that

02:07.180 --> 02:11.860
You know answering that question just the way that that you hear it or the way you understand it

02:12.100 --> 02:14.540
You're gonna use a client. Okay, so for example

02:15.420 --> 02:18.120
This is how you're gonna answer instead of saying yeah

02:18.340 --> 02:22.900
Well, we don't do exclusive leads you could say well, and this is kind of the response

02:22.900 --> 02:26.460
I like to give is if somebody says something like that and say hey, what's the difference between you and home advisor?

02:26.460 --> 02:31.780
Well, and I'd say something like well, basically the only thing that's the same as we work with contractors

02:31.820 --> 02:36.540
No, but for real and then this is what I would say I'd say so I'd say no

02:36.540 --> 02:39.140
But for real like we have a guy his name is Joe

02:39.140 --> 02:44.420
He's he's our duct cleaning client in Chicago. You can look up his site as Chicago duct cleaning

02:44.580 --> 02:46.460
And his biggest thing because he was working

02:46.460 --> 02:49.260
He was actually working just like you with home advisor for like three years

02:49.620 --> 02:54.700
His biggest thing and we just talked him last week is he's keep saying over and over is like dude

02:55.100 --> 02:57.500
Just the fact that I don't have to worry about

02:58.100 --> 03:04.900
Competing with four other companies in town and I have the lead exclusively to myself has made all the difference in the world

03:05.100 --> 03:09.900
So just so you know, we work with one company exclusively and we don't share the leads

03:10.660 --> 03:14.020
You say that guys you use it like that

03:14.020 --> 03:18.700
It's a little bit it takes a little bit more effort of thinking and it gets it gets easier

03:18.700 --> 03:24.980
But you use that and now it's not me saying it's Joe. It's Joe the duck cleaner in Chicago

03:25.500 --> 03:33.140
It not only does it hold way more weight, but it also builds authority and it removes the objection of trust

03:33.380 --> 03:39.020
Okay, it removes the objection of trust because now you're not just some random schmo

03:39.020 --> 03:46.340
That's in his mom's basement now. You're a human being that has other clients. You're a human being that has other clients in Chicago

03:46.340 --> 03:51.020
You're a human being that has other clients in duck cleaning, which is the same industry as this guy

03:51.340 --> 03:57.420
So just doing that simple thing you are removing this objection. There's a huge objection of trust
