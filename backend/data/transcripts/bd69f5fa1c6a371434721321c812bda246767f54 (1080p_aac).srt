1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,560
The pre-closed screencast guys this is a highly highly effective tool this is

2
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,760
something that should not be skipped this is something that really needs to

3
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,800
be done properly okay so before we top over to the screen I give you guys the

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,320
template I want you guys to understand the objective of the pre-closed

5
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,040
screencast which is part of the bigger picture of the setup which is part of

6
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:37,000
the bigger picture of closing the deal okay the purpose and the objective of

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,260
the pre-closed screencast is twofold number one is to overcome objections

8
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,600
that you haven't covered yet okay and there are certain objections that

9
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,960
we covered that we talked about that just fit really nicely inside of the

10
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,920
screencast because it might be weird to bring them up during a phone call okay

11
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,560
so number one is to bring up and overcome objections number two is this

12
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:03,120
is an opportunity for you to basically pitch them without being interrupted and

13
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,640
without having the pressure of them being on the call like it's really

14
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,600
really nice because you can give this amazing pitch without them even

15
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,360
interrupting you or without feeling like it's a pitch okay and so that those are

16
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:18,200
the two objectives during this but this is something that I used to not do and I

17
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,280
started implementing this about a year ago maybe it's even less not maybe eight

18
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:26,480
months ago and it is what it works like a charm because it really gets them

19
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,800
prepped for the call and you guys will probably if you remember back to when

20
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:34,640
you joined this program okay you probably received a video and you should

21
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,640
have received a video right before it said watch this video before we talk and

22
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:44,160
during that I overcame a couple of last a couple last objections where I said

23
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:48,880
hey if you need to talk to your mom or your dog or your goldfish or your aunt

24
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,600
bring them to the call because we're not doing the whole I want to think about

25
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,840
it thing okay and I was overcoming that objection and I and I showed social

26
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,760
proof and I did a few things that's the equivalent of my pre-closed screencast

27
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:04,360
that I'm gonna teach you here so let's hop over the screen so here we have the

28
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:10,420
pre-closed screencast template and I want to share with you the structure okay

29
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:13,240
so there's a couple things that you need to include you don't have to do it in

30
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,760
this specific order this is the order that I do it in and I just want to

31
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,560
explain it this way so the first thing is we want to make sure and by the way

32
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,720
I'm gonna give you guys examples of this we're gonna have some some examples

33
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:29,880
attached some examples there's tons of examples already in the group of actual

34
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,000
screencasts that I've done so I'm not gonna share one in this video because I

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,480
don't want to make it long I just want to share the template okay so the first

36
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,400
thing is I want to share how we get our leads in the strategy behind it and the

37
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,840
thing that I use here is I show them an actual example and I like to use the

38
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:50,840
monopoly strategy slash concept so I explain the monopoly thing I say hey

39
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,520
look when you're playing monopoly there's a giant board and the more

40
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,360
properties that you can you know buy the better chance you have a win in the game

41
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,840
and these properties at the top or the boardwalk the park place etc etc etc

42
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,480
that's how I explain it and I explain how we get the leads guys I've been in

43
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:10,480
groups where people ask they're like hey what happens at the business owner they

44
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,760
ask what the website is if they ask what happens if they ask I'm getting the

45
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:19,320
lead tell them okay guys you don't need to hide stuff this is a very straight-up

46
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:23,480
process you do not need to hide anything so number one thing is I explain how we

47
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,120
get the leads in the strategy behind again there's gonna be an example I

48
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,240
show you this entire thing okay the second thing as I've listed here is I

49
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:35,480
show example sites so I like to best case scenario is you show them a niche

50
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:39,200
sorry you show them a site in the niche that you're going after so if you're

51
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,120
targeting somebody that's doing concrete you show them an example of concrete

52
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,320
you show them a site you show them results you use that as a case study

53
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,680
however if you don't have one this is your first time going into that niche

54
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,920
what I would do and what I typically like to do is I like to show them a case

55
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:59,920
study an example or a site in that city or close to that city so here in st.

56
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,200
George let's say I have a duck cleaning site but I'm going after tree service I

57
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,200
might not have any other tree services my first tree service site but I'm gonna

58
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:10,120
show them a duck cleaning site because it just relates they're like oh that

59
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,400
guy's in st. George that lady's in st. George that makes sense right we're

60
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,760
showing these examples so I put that right here preferably in their niche or

61
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:22,240
in their state and city and then if you guys have a lot of leads coming from

62
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,480
those projects let's say you have a site already built it's generating leads you

63
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:30,440
can show that if you don't don't worry it's there's not specific things you

64
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,340
need to show you it's just showing them that you've done this before if you have

65
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:37,400
a really good case study and you can show them hey this business owner has

66
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:43,640
gotten this many leads show them that okay I noted here if you don't have any

67
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:47,720
projects you don't have any other sites leverage the group man leverage the

68
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,800
group we have so many case studies combined between all of us in this

69
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,880
program at the time of recording this it's so many case studies so many

70
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,360
websites leverage the group so if you don't have any don't worry about it make

71
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,480
a post search for post and say hey guys does anyone have a concrete project I

72
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:09,760
can use as a case study use and leverage the group okay number three is I show

73
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:15,720
social proof okay including screenshots of text messages reviews etc also

74
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,000
sometimes show contracts whatever stripe accounts the proof number one I have

75
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,120
customers number two that people are really making some some money so what I

76
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,920
would recommend is anytime you're communicating with a business owner and

77
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:29,960
they tell you about some amazing story that they closed a huge monster deal

78
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,560
we've all been on the phone or you will be on the phone where the business owner

79
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,520
says hey you sent me those leads I just closed a $50,000 job what I say in those

80
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,400
situations I'm like hey just so I can use that as kind of a testimony I'm

81
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,240
gonna message you here in just a second after we help with the phone I'm gonna

82
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,880
ask you a question about how things are going if you would just respond don't be

83
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,760
fake about it but if you would just respond and tell me you just what you

84
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,880
just told me on text I can screenshot that and use that as a case study and I

85
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,880
can use that as proof that this works if you wouldn't mind that would help me out

86
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,520
immensely and guys I just have a folder of case studies so for example one of

87
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:07,000
the ones I use you're gonna see this in the example is I had this lady in Las

88
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,200
Vegas and she sends me a text she's like hey I just closed one of your leads for

89
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:15,920
like 40 grand so I like to show that example I'm like hey here's one of my

90
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:20,720
artificial turf clients in Las Vegas she closed the job for 40,000 bucks okay

91
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,960
it's literally proving like hey I showed you the lead value calculator but here

92
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,520
is proof that they're actually that these people are actually closing jobs

93
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:33,200
okay so I like to show social proof including screenshots screenshots of

94
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:37,920
text messages reviews etc and then I also like to explain this is where I'm

95
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:43,280
gonna explain the deal structure so I will basically shit on commission I'm

96
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:47,480
like hey just you guys know or just so you know here's how the deal typically

97
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,760
works and how we do this first of all we don't and that's how I say first of all

98
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,840
we don't do commission okay there's no skin in the game for you and there's no

99
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,880
incentive for me to even send you leads because I don't even know if you're

100
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,680
gonna close I don't do commission never have never will okay secondly I don't do

101
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,680
paper lead and in the beginning just so you guys understand or just so you

102
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,440
understand mr. business owner mr. business owner I did this in the

103
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,720
beginning and I tell a story I say I used to work with this company and I

104
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:13,000
sent them leads and we agreed a hundred bucks a lead okay here's what happened

105
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,160
is I they were cool paying at you know I usually shoot high so I get kind of

106
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,960
start price anchoring them I said they were they were cool at a hundred bucks a

107
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,120
lead sending them 20 30 leads paying two three bucks two three grand a month but

108
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,840
my whole goal the whole time was how do I jack these leads how do I get to 50 60

109
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,520
70 because I wanted to make more money obviously I'm human right and let me

110
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,960
tell you what happened once I got and I had that month where the website ranked

111
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,280
and the leads got spiked through the air and I sent them 70 leads and invoice for

112
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:44,120
seven grand you know what happened they pulled out the red pencil and all of a

113
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,280
sudden it became hey that lead didn't answer hey that lead was it was too far

114
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:53,240
out hey that lead was a small job and it became this this whole nitpicky thing

115
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:57,200
okay and it really strained the relationship so since that time that's

116
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,320
been a while that's been two years ago three years ago I have done something

117
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:05,120
that's been way better and it's called a flat fee deal and so mr. business or

118
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,740
what that means is it's a flat fee deal you pay a certain amount every month or

119
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:13,680
every week and you get every single lead from this website what does that mean

120
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,440
well sometimes during the winter it's gonna be slow I'm gonna tell you that

121
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,800
right now okay guess what in the spring when the leads are just crushing it and

122
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,560
it's tax return time and people are cleaning up their yards and blah blah

123
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,360
blah I'm not gonna come out to you for more money okay so you know exactly how

124
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,680
much is coming out every single month and you get the upside of those

125
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:36,600
additional leads okay that's it guys those are the things that I include in

126
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:41,220
my screencast I noted here do not give price do not give price I usually let

127
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,120
them know after I explain the deal structure I'm like hey as far as the

128
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:48,240
actual cost per month or per week we're gonna discuss that tomorrow I got to

129
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,800
finish writing the numbers but I promise you will be reasonable and then I last

130
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,480
thing as I noted here is I like to end with a pullback okay so what I say is

131
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,160
hey so I'm look I'm really looking forward to talking tomorrow and by the

132
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,360
way like all I want to do is see if this is a good fit if we find out this is a

133
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,720
good fit let's make something happen let's make a lot of money together but

134
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:12,200
at the same time if it's not no big deal you know there's a lot of companies to

135
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,240
work with and I only work with one okay see tomorrow and I just end with that

136
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:20,160
pullback I'm taking off the pressure I'm letting them know hey no big deal no

137
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,980
harm no foul I end with that pullback guys the pullbacks you can use them

138
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,180
again and again and again and you can never overuse them so guys after you've

139
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:30,900
done the screencast and just so you know I should have mentioned this earlier the

140
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:36,480
tool that I like to use is a tool it's called the Vimeo recorder in fact hop

141
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,000
over the screen let me show you what I'm talking about so guys over here on the

142
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,600
Google Chrome store if you guys aren't using Google Chrome you're crazy I've

143
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,840
already mentioned this you need to be go to the just type in Google Chrome store

144
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:51,060
and you can get this little plug-in or this little extension I apologize just

145
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:55,260
type in Vimeo and it's this Vimeo record I love this one because you can just

146
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:59,360
push up here you could probably see it right here you could just push this and

147
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,560
like if I click it like this it's literally just gonna let me push start

148
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:07,000
recording and I'm automatically there and then as soon as I'm done it's just

149
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,680
gonna upload it to my Vimeo account okay so I really really like that tool but

150
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,080
there's a ton of tools that you can use so make sure that you record the tool as

151
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:20,520
a screencast that's number one number two when you send this screencast make

152
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:24,120
sure that you can track it so you know there's like if you want to use loom

153
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,640
that's cool too loom is gonna tell you when they open the screencast that's a

154
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,460
cool tool I like having Vimeo because I use Vimeo for everything loom would be a

155
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:38,000
cool tool because you can see it so what I typically do is I use a software where

156
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,200
if I send this as an email I send a link as an email I can tell when they

157
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,120
open the email and when they clicked on the link and there's a ton of tools I

158
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,680
don't even want to mention any but I used to use one called banana tag which

159
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,080
they've since kind of gone out of business I don't even know if my banana

160
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:58,680
tag even works anymore and so I don't even have to ask myself guys what we're

161
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:02,280
using at this time but I definitely recommend finding something and you

162
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:09,360
could just go ahead and Google and type in link let's see like email opening

163
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,440
software whatever and there's gonna be tons of options let me get rid of this

164
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:22,160
this is really bugging me okay trash this get rid of this okay yeah so write

165
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,440
inbox sales handy mail check whatever just use something so that you know

166
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:32,800
when they open the link and when they watch the video okay lastly make sure

167
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,200
they watch the video okay if you guys record these videos and then they don't

168
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,720
watch them what why'd you record it right why did you record it make sure

169
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,400
they watch the video so before you jump on the call say hey talk to you in 30

170
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:48,560
minutes just want to make sure you watch the video before we talk okay that is

171
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,520
going to be part of the the the objections we're overcoming part of the

172
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:55,120
objections during that video so they have to watch it you guys notice before

173
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,520
we got on a call before you join flat view mastery you were sent a video and

174
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:04,680
and I said or whoever onboarded you said hey make sure you watch this video

175
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:09,880
before we talk guys there is no hidden secret here I am doing the exact same

176
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:14,280
process that I'm teaching right here and it's working like a charm and the last

177
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:19,240
thing I want to mention is the length of these videos should be no more than 10

178
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:23,440
minutes 10 to 12 max but guys if you start rambling on you start talking

179
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,200
about stupid stuff that no one cares about you start talking about backlinks

180
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,920
and you start including stuff that I didn't cover in the template you're

181
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,200
going to lose them they're not gonna watch the video okay get to the point be

182
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,720
conversational talk to them like you're talking to them in person and make this

183
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,400
something that they can actually stand listening to do not get into backlinks

184
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:45,840
and the ranking and all this crazy stuff and do not make this 15 minutes okay 10

185
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:49,120
minutes or less the shorter the better the shorter that the shorter it is the

186
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,920
more likely they are to watch the video
