00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
Luke says, I bought the Xpire domain from a roofer who let Xpire.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,360
He rebranded.

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,280
I'm thinking of reaching out to them, but it's in California.

4
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,720
You recommend against California and roofing.

5
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,200
So I'm wondering if it's two, just two bad things.

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,840
I'm thinking of reaching out.

7
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,200
Yeah, reach out, dude.

8
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,440
I only like, the only reason I say avoid California is there's easier places to make money.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,400
But if you can find a spot that has like, I would go and research that person's city.

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,440
How is the competition?

11
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,000
How many leads are there actually flowing through that city?

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,440
Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

13
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,000
Okay.

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,800
That's what I would do.

15
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,920
And then you can make that decision.

16
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,360
I don't think it's the worst thing ever.

17
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,200
I just think it's not the greatest use of your time if you have another option.

18
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:35,600
Okay.
