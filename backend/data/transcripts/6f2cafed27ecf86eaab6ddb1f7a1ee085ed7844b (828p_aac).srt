1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,920
What would you say to a BO if they ask,

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:05,840
can you teach me to build my own website?

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,720
Or this one's probably one that people get more often

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,320
is why do I need you when I can build my own website?

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,600
Seems easy enough.

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,200
And I guess my clarification,

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,420
and I'm gonna make some assumptions here,

8
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:18,040
but my clarification is like,

9
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,080
are we building websites or are we generating leads?

10
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,240
So I'm assuming that you're talking about generating leads.

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,680
And if the business owner,

12
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,720
if that's just wasn't clarified, then that's fine.

13
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:28,800
But let's say the business owner said,

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,560
why do I need you if I can just build my own website

15
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,800
and get my own leads?

16
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,560
Then my question or my response to that would be like,

17
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,680
if you honestly, sir, if you can do that,

18
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,360
then you should go do that by all means, by all means.

19
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,680
But like, why haven't you done that yet?

20
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,520
Right?

21
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,920
Like that makes zero sense.

22
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,920
Like, and so I don't think I've ever got the second one.

23
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,520
Why would like, why do I need you?

24
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,080
Then I guess my question would be like,

25
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,520
well, then why are you paying home advisor?

26
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,680
If you could do it, why haven't you done it yet?

27
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,480
Right.

28
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,280
And I'm not gonna,

29
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,960
I know that like a lot of people want me to go,

30
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,040
probably say, well, you should focus on your business

31
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,120
and I'll focus on mine.

32
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,040
It's like, no, call them out.

33
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,360
Okay, Bob, go do it.

34
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,680
And guess, I'd probably kind of be a little bit,

35
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,520
I'd probably be a little tongue in cheek here

36
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,520
and I'd go, I'd say something like along the lines of like,

37
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,320
oh, I didn't know you had that skillset.

38
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,280
If you have that skillset,

39
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,600
like I'm looking for good people.

40
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,480
Why don't you just build the website

41
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,440
and then I'll buy the leads from you?

42
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,440
No, seriously, because I think I can go get,

43
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,600
sell them somewhere else for hire.

44
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,800
Like, and honestly, if you know how to build them,

45
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,120
then do it A for yourself and then we should talk

46
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,760
because maybe you can help me with some of these webs.

47
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,640
Like they're full of crap, okay?

48
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,640
That's number one.

49
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,880
The first part of it, which was,

50
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,200
what was the first part of that question?

51
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,080
Which was, what was it?

52
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,960
Can you teach me to build my own website?

53
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,800
Is that what you're referring to?

54
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,640
Oh, yeah.

55
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,160
If they ask that, I would just say, yeah, I can.

56
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,200
But like, are you, you just want a website?

57
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,080
Again, is it, can you,

58
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,000
can you teach me to build my own website

59
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,840
or can you teach me to get leads?

60
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,680
Because there's a big difference

61
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,240
between getting leads and building a website.

62
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,080
Because if you just want to build a website,

63
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,520
then why don't you just go to GoDaddy

64
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,340
and throw up a website.

65
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,180
But guess what?

66
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:28,580
A website for a website's sake is a waste of money.

67
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,980
If your website's not generating leads,

68
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,340
why do you have a website?

69
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,420
Yeah.

70
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,660
Yeah, and the only other thing I'd add to that is,

71
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,980
one, they're probably not qualified.

72
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,260
So it's probably a business owner

73
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,060
that you would want to work with in the first place.

74
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,780
But then it also just goes back to the monopoly model

75
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,620
that we talked about.

76
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,500
Like, hey, the whole goal is to get your property,

77
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,220
our property, and you get as many leads as possible.

78
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,460
But if you don't want more leads,

79
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,700
then you can just stick with your website.

80
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,320
So. 100%.

81
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,160
100%.
