00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
Enon says, it just seemed that Queen Creek was pretty obvious right off the bat.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:08,240
A lot of the areas, yeah, and that's probably true, but you notice the difference.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,880
Let me show you. Well, I can just share my screen and show you this.

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,560
Okay, let's look at this.

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:26,000
Population, Queen Creek, Arizona is 59,000 a couple of years ago. Let's look at we say if we type in 2023.

6
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:38,320
Okay, 78,000. Let's do the same thing for Jacksonville, Florida, almost a million.

7
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:48,080
Okay, so let me just say this, Enon. The more population, usually the more business owners,

8
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:57,200
usually the more variables. And so I would go as far as to say that the lower population cities,

9
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,040
it's going to be more cut and dry. And that is why I mentioned in the training,

10
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:08,400
I have done very, very well in going into this as small of city as possible that still has the

11
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:14,640
search volume. So I start at the 50,000 or the 40,000, and then I look and I'll look at 20 cities

12
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,280
and find the one or two that actually have enough search volume. And then I'll start doing due

13
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,480
diligence instead of like my rule of thumb is if I look at a map, and I look at the map, and I look

14
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:29,680
at the map, and I look at the map, and I look at the map, and I look at the map, and I look at the

15
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:36,560
map, and I can see the city, everyone else can see the city, and that's probably on their list to

16
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:42,880
go and look at first. That makes sense? So I understand the frustration is like, well, obviously,

17
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:49,120
Nick, Queen Creek was cut and dry. Go look at cities between 50,000 and 80,000 across the US

18
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:53,840
in pavers, and you're going to see stuff that's a lot more cut and dry. The bigger the city,

19
00:01:53,840 --> 00:02:00,400
the more competition, the more variables. And that's just the reality. Now, also in that same

20
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:05,120
breadth, usually the bigger the win. If you can get ranked, like I would love to see somebody that

21
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:12,480
has SEMrush, go and type in that Jacksonville paversfl.com. Go look at the amount of traffic.

22
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,360
I bet they're getting a hell of traffic because it's such a big city. But I'm telling you, Edward,

23
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:26,800
I would not be going into that city. It's too competitive. It's too big. The CPC is too high.

24
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,560
Okay. Hopefully, that answered your question, Ema.
