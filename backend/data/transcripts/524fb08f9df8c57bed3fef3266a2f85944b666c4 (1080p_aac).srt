1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,480
As I said in the beginning, if you're going to run ads, you're just going to need to go

2
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,360
ahead and expect and accept the fact that you are going to have an ad suspension.

3
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,360
Okay?

4
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,260
And if you're watching this video just to watch this video and you haven't had one yet,

5
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:25,260
no problem.

6
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,260
It's totally fine.

7
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:30,140
I've had people that have seen people have ad suspensions and they ask, and it's a good

8
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,140
question.

9
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,140
They say, hey, what can I do?

10
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:35,700
What are the top two or three things I can do to avoid ad suspensions?

11
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:36,700
Okay?

12
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,580
My advice is don't worry about it.

13
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,580
Okay?

14
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:40,580
Now don't do something stupid.

15
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:44,540
And if you see somebody comment on something, like try your best to avoid it.

16
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:48,500
But what I'm telling you right now is that it happens to everybody.

17
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,500
It really does.

18
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:55,540
For example, I have run a one point, at this point, time I'm recording this, $1.2 million

19
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:56,540
in ads.

20
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:57,540
Okay?

21
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:00,300
It took me four years to get an ad suspension.

22
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,300
Four.

23
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,300
Okay?

24
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,300
And I had actually spent over a million dollars.

25
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,300
And I was like, you know what?

26
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,300
I'm good.

27
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,060
I'm not going to get the suspension, whatever.

28
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:11,460
And I got four in one single day after spending a million dollars.

29
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:16,800
So Google doesn't, it's not a respecter of persons as they say in the Bible, right?

30
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,800
They don't care.

31
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,800
They don't care how much money you spend.

32
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,960
They don't care who you are.

33
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,260
They're going to suspend you at some point.

34
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:25,220
And here's my theory is Google, and you got to look at it from Google's perspective, right?

35
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:26,900
Google's a massive company.

36
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,340
We talked about this a little bit at the beginning.

37
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,540
They're trying to protect their own butts, okay?

38
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,380
You can't really blame them.

39
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:34,860
So I just want to say, number one, it's going to happen.

40
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,820
And so the first thing is, when this happens, I want you to, if you're watching this video

41
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,700
because you just got a suspension, take a deep breath, okay?

42
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:51,980
Breathe in, exhale, and realize you ain't special because everybody deals with them,

43
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:52,980
okay?

44
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,980
So just realize everyone dealt with them.

45
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,780
Up until this point, and at the time of recording, I know we have a couple students that are

46
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:04,260
currently under some suspensions, but I, to my knowledge, okay, again, to my knowledge,

47
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,980
at the time of recording, with how many students, I don't even know how many students we have

48
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:11,220
right now, but we have not had one student that's come into this program that has had

49
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:15,460
a suspension that we have not been able to find a solution for, okay?

50
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:18,820
And for the people that are in one right now that are going to watch this going on, oh,

51
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,500
that's me, I'm going to be the one, I promise you're not going to be the one.

52
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,780
You're not going to be the one because we haven't had that happen with anyone.

53
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,820
You are going to go through it, it's going to happen, and the way I look at it is two

54
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:29,820
ways.

55
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:33,340
Number one is once you get through it, I've seen that Google doesn't hit you again with

56
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,340
a suspension.

57
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:38,100
Typically, it's like they give you the suspension, you get through it, and they're like, okay,

58
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,660
that guy, that girl, she's good.

59
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,320
That's a real business because they appealed that many times.

60
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,260
No fake clown would do that.

61
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,620
They're good, we're going to let them through.

62
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,060
I haven't changed anything.

63
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:51,340
Since I had my suspensions and I appealed them and I got out, I haven't changed one thing.

64
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:54,140
I didn't learn my lesson, I didn't get slapped on the wrist and go, oh, I'm not going to

65
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:57,520
do this or that because Google doesn't even know what you did wrong.

66
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:01,320
You go ask their people, you get on a hold of their team, which is almost impossible,

67
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,580
they can't even tell you.

68
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,980
Take a deep breath, relax.

69
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,120
Everyone's been through it.

70
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,660
No one's not gotten through it.

71
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,660
There's always a solution.

72
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:10,660
I promise you that.

73
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:13,660
Let's talk about these suspensions just really briefly.

74
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:17,940
I want to talk about the two types of suspensions really, really quick.

75
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:22,980
Number one suspension is, well, it's not in any order, but what you're going to see more

76
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:28,780
often than not is the suspicious payment suspension, which happens to be a little bit more difficult

77
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:34,540
to unsuspend from, at least compared to the second suspension type, which is something

78
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,540
around circumvention.

79
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:38,660
They'll say, hey, you circumvented systems or circumvented this.

80
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:42,740
I don't even remember the verbiage, but they're going to tell you, you got some kind of circumvention.

81
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,840
Those are the two things.

82
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,340
Most people that are watching this, most people are going to have some kind of suspicious

83
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,500
payment suspension.

84
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,780
Guys, what you're going to do if you do have a suspension.

85
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:57,020
The game is really, you just want to make sure there's nothing weird.

86
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:01,900
Some of the things that when I say weird that I've seen is, let's say three years ago, and

87
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:06,420
if any of these trigger thoughts, oh yeah, yeah, that's me, go and fix these things.

88
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:11,700
I know we had a student that years and years ago, they had set up an ad really quickly

89
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,780
and they're like, oh crap, I forgot about it.

90
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:18,540
They went, they checked it out, and there was a balance of literally like $2, or maybe

91
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,540
it was even like 20 cents.

92
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:24,780
They went and they paid it, and then a couple days later, a couple appeals later, voila,

93
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:25,780
they're going.

94
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:26,860
That's one thing I've seen.

95
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:33,100
Other thing is, I've seen people, they've used weird cards.

96
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,860
They've had cards on multiple accounts.

97
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:39,980
What I would tell you with suspicious payments is we need to diagnose the problem.

98
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,780
If you have multiple accounts, go and check all of those.

99
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,540
Make sure there's no balances that are outstanding.

100
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,580
It might be something as dumb as 20 cents.

101
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:48,580
Who knows?

102
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:55,300
Then also, how many accounts, how many Google ad accounts is your card linked to?

103
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:59,620
I know that it seems like, again, I don't know, but it seems like that seems to be a

104
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,740
big factor.

105
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:06,180
What I want to tell you not to do, what I don't want you to do, the first thing is do

106
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,580
not go and create another ad account.

107
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,580
Do not go and create another ad account.

108
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,060
You think Google is that stupid.

109
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,060
They understand how people operate.

110
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,340
They know how people think.

111
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,700
That is not going to do anything.

112
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,700
Don't go and create another ad account.

113
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:22,300
All that you're going to do is you're going to try and make sure there's nothing else

114
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:27,060
that's weird out there, no extra accounts, no outstanding balances.

115
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,460
Ask yourself, what kind of a card am I using?

116
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:33,500
Am I using some weird one-off card, whatever, some prepaid visa, whatever it is.

117
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,740
I don't even think they would allow that.

118
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,420
Go and close all those things up.

119
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:41,940
What you're going to do is you're just going to go and you're going to fill out an appeal.

120
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:42,940
You're going to click on the button.

121
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:46,740
It's going to say, if you think this is wrong, click here, and I'm not going to show you

122
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,620
on the screen because it's going to change.

123
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:53,740
Go find that button, click it, and it's going to have this application, this appeal application.

124
00:05:53,740 --> 00:06:00,020
Go and fill it out and fill it out as thoroughly as you possibly can.

125
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:02,540
As thoroughly as you possibly can without spending that much time.

126
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:06,500
You're going to go through it, you're going to hit submit or whatever the verbiage is

127
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:10,520
and you're going to send it off, and what's going to happen is it's going to be off with

128
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:15,440
Google for sometimes 24 hours, sometimes a couple days, sometimes I feel like it's

129
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,720
a week.

130
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,720
You're going to send it off and they're going to come back and most often the first time

131
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:25,080
they're going to say, we apologize for the inconvenience but your appeal request has

132
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,080
not been granted.

133
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,160
You're like, oh my gosh, the world's ending.

134
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,160
It's not.

135
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,160
What are you going to do?

136
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,960
You're going to go appeal again.

137
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,360
This time you're going to ask yourself, did I fill it out thoroughly?

138
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,960
If you didn't, damn it, fill it out thoroughly because you should have done that the first

139
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,960
time.

140
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,280
You're going to appeal and you're going to send it off.

141
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,280
Is there anything that you missed?

142
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,520
Any answers that you were half-assed that you could fill out better?

143
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,520
Go and appeal again.

144
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,880
You're just going to do this process and I know that you're going to be like, oh my gosh,

145
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,880
this sounds terrible.

146
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,880
It is.

147
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,880
It sucks.

148
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,280
You're going to do this process and I have seen, there's one student I can think of off

149
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:01,160
the top of my head, they did this seven times before finally Google's like, okay, you win.

150
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,160
Here you go.

151
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,160
You're good.

152
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:07,840
Until you've gone seven, eight, I would venture to say, until you've appealed 10 times and

153
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,320
you're still running into the same thing.

154
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,320
Keep appealing.

155
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:14,560
Now, if you're not doing anything and you have accounts that are out there and you haven't

156
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,000
checked to see if there's any weird stuff, then yeah, you might appeal forever, but as

157
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,160
long as you shut all that down and go and check that and go do a very thorough, what

158
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,160
would be the word?

159
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,440
You want to go and just make sure, an audit, a thorough audit of accounts that you may

160
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,440
have set up.

161
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,440
Try and think.

162
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,640
Was there a time when you watched a video in another group and they told you to go do

163
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,440
and you wouldn't set up this ad account and think like, what emails?

164
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,240
What I do is I go and search on my phone, I have all these emails linked up, I go and

165
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,440
search Google ads or payment successful and I look, oh, and I look at the email, it said

166
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,440
it too.

167
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,520
Oh, it looks like I had my ad account set up under that email and the reality is in

168
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,480
this business, we set up a lot of emails, we have a lot of burner emails, we have a

169
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,840
lot of accounts and it kind of sucks and if you're not good at organization, you can get

170
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,280
stuff kind of spread out, go and shut all that down and you're just going to appeal.

171
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,520
You're going to fill it out properly.

172
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,520
You're going to appeal.

173
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,520
You're going to fill it out properly.

174
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,520
You're going to appeal.

175
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,520
You're going to fill it out properly.

176
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,520
You're going to appeal.

177
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,520
And you will get unsuspended.

178
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:15,040
Now, obviously, as should be the case with any question, go and search the group, go

179
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,040
and look at the threads.

180
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:20,480
If those don't answer your questions, reach out to people, make your own post, tag the

181
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,960
people that have gone through it.

182
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,520
I know there's people that have gone through the freaking wringer and they figured out

183
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,400
a way to get out of it, but what I would tell you is this.

184
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,280
If you want to get out of the suspension, you will get out of it.

185
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:36,240
If literally a Google ad suspension is enough to throw you off, maybe you should consider

186
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,360
the fact that maybe you're not cut out for this.

187
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:42,040
I love the fact that there's ad suspensions because I know it's going to eliminate half,

188
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:46,240
if not 75% of the people that want to be successful and they're going to have an ad suspension.

189
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,000
As soon as they get it, they're done.

190
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,440
They're not going to try to do the ad suspension because it's too much work and they just don't

191
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,840
want to deal with it and they're just going to stick with ranking and waiting six months,

192
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,840
not me.

193
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,840
I'm going to figure it out.

194
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,160
I'm going to get to the bottom of it and I'm going to go.

195
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,200
That's with the suspicious payment.

196
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,480
With circumventing, it's the same exact process.

197
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,680
Click the appeal, fill it out, send it.

198
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:12,640
It seems to me in my experience and talking to students, if you have a circumventing issue,

199
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,640
it seems to get appealed a lot quicker because it's more cut and dry whereas suspicious payments

200
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,000
kind of out there, but guys, you're just going to appeal.

201
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,080
You're going to fill it out.

202
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:25,200
You're going to appeal after you've closed any doors that are weird, cards that are on

203
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,640
multiple accounts, et cetera.

204
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:35,760
Guys, once again, when you get a suspension, take a deep breath, exhale, realize you're

205
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,320
not special.

206
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,320
Everybody deals with them.

207
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,320
I deal with them.

208
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,320
You deal with them.

209
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,320
Every single person deals with them.

210
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,600
We're going to get through it.

211
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,600
We're going to keep appealing.

212
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,600
It doesn't matter if it's going to take 10 times, we're going to appeal and then once

213
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:54,560
we get on the other side of the appeal, we're back in action.
