1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Let's get into it.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:13,740
Before we jump into it, guys, I want to share with you a quick story.

3
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,500
When I was doing door-to-door sales, and I promise I'm going to make this really quick,

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,660
when I was doing door-to-door sales, they would literally drop us off in neighborhoods

5
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:21,060
and we would just start knocking doors.

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:27,020
And I am not the sharpest tool in the shed, as they say, but I learned really quickly

7
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:32,220
If I would just knock on the homes of people who already had security systems, so like

8
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:39,160
ADT or Monotronics, these different companies, I would look for those security signs.

9
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,980
When I knocked on these houses, in the beginning I didn't do it on purpose, and I knocked on

10
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:46,260
these houses, it was a really different sale, it was a completely different thing.

11
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,980
I didn't have to convince them that they should get security, I didn't have to convince them

12
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,460
that security was a good idea.

13
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:56,100
I didn't have them telling me, oh, I have a gun, I have Smith & Wesson, I have a dog,

14
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,100
it's a safe neighbor.

15
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:02,340
I didn't have these objections because they were already paying for security.

16
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,860
So what was cool is I would knock on these doors, and my pitch was very simple, it was

17
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:09,340
like, I would knock and I would say, hey, my name's Nick, blah blah blah, I'm with this

18
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:13,860
company right here, I know you're already paying for XYZ service and I already know

19
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,220
how much you're paying, what we're doing for everybody in the neighborhood is we're just

20
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,980
upgrading them, we're giving them a camera, we're giving them a door lock, we're giving

21
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:24,140
them this, we're upgrading their system, it's the same price per month, roughly, and we're

22
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:27,420
going to put you on a phone app, can I step inside and show you what this looks like on

23
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,420
paper?

24
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,940
And that was it, and I was right inside the house, we were talking numbers.

25
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:34,380
It wasn't this big emotional sale, it wasn't this long, dry-out thing, it was very, very

26
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,940
cut and dry.

27
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:40,700
And so what it did, and this is what I want to talk about, is this collapsed time.

28
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:44,780
I was trying, every single year when I was doing this job, I was like, how do I make

29
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:45,780
more sales?

30
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:46,780
How do I make more sales?

31
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:51,420
And I didn't have the leverage of the internet or any of these tools, it was literally sweat

32
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,420
equity.

33
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:55,600
How can I get more deals done in less amount of time?

34
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,700
And the way that I was able to do this is by collapsing time, and it was by going after

35
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,340
these type of customers.

36
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:05,260
Guys, there's three things I want to share here as to why we're going to target people

37
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,620
that are already paying for ads.

38
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:11,940
Number one is when you call people and you target people that are already paying for

39
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:17,520
ads, already sold on what you're selling, you only need to make one sale.

40
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,300
What I mean by that is you don't need to call a business owner and convince them that, hey,

41
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,980
Mr. Business Owner, advertising is a good idea.

42
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:26,740
You don't need to do that because they already know they're already paying for it.

43
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:30,940
So what it is, all you need to do is you need to let them know, hey, Mr. Business Owner,

44
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,660
here's why you should work with me.

45
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,800
Here's why my product is better than what you're paying for, or not even better than,

46
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,240
but also a good fit, okay?

47
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,940
So you only need to make one sale.

48
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:44,620
Second reason is you're going to have to talk to less people to get deals.

49
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:47,820
You're not going to have to go through so many people to find a deal.

50
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:51,420
When you just go and you're targeting and you're prospecting and you just go to Google

51
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:55,700
and you type in concrete Minneapolis, you're going to have to go through a lot of business

52
00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:00,860
owners to find people that are sold on your product and then sold on you, and it's going

53
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:01,860
to take a long time.

54
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:06,420
But when you're specifically targeting people who are already sold, you're going to get

55
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:11,220
a deal a lot quicker, and you're going to have to go through a lot less heartache, headache,

56
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,380
pain to get to that deal.

57
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,300
Third reason is this, guys.

58
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:19,940
When you're talking to people that are already sold on what you're selling, they conceptually

59
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:25,460
understand, okay, I pay for advertising because it's going to get me more business, I understand

60
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:29,860
what leads are, and so what this does is it allows you to collapse time.

61
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:33,820
They conceptually understand the concept of paying for advertising, and so these deals

62
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,140
tend to go a lot quicker.

63
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:38,160
When you're talking to somebody who's never spent money on ads, they've never spent money

64
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:44,220
on Google Ads, Home Advisor, Angie's List, et cetera, you have to explain everything.

65
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,060
Hey, Mr. Business Owner, this is what cost per click is.

66
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,100
Hey, Mr. Business Owner, this is how a lead is, or this is what a lead is.

67
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,100
Hey, Mr. Business Owner, this is what the customer sees.

68
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,500
Hey, Mr. Business Owner, this is why we're better than Google Ads.

69
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:58,860
But when they're already paying for advertising, you don't have to do all that.

70
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:02,500
They conceptually understand it, and these deals tend to go quicker.

71
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,420
So guys, let's go ahead and build the list.
