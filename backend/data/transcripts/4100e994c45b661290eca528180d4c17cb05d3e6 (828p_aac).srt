1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,160
All right, boom, recording, Porter, you can hear me.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:11,200
I see Porter, I'm afraid Nils was on, Moza was on, I don't know who else is on.

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,800
Guys, my name is Nick, this is Porter, we're brothers, and I'm just going to share a couple

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,800
things really quick.

5
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:23,960
If you can hear me, let me know, if I'm choppy, Moza can hear me all the way from South Africa,

6
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,440
so that means that it's working, okay?

7
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:32,440
So we're going to do this in 20 minutes or less, maybe 15.

8
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:37,800
What I want to talk about today, I want to, I think I titled this, how to make money building

9
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,600
simple websites with zero technical knowledge, okay?

10
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:48,600
The reason why I want to do this and go live, number one is because I've realized that no

11
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,360
matter how much you talk about what you do, you're going to get sick of talking about

12
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,720
it before people even know what you do.

13
00:00:53,800 --> 00:01:00,680
I talk to people all the time, they're on my Facebook, they're, I think, maybe they

14
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,040
can't stop unfriending me.

15
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,920
I always think they're on my Facebook, they're like, so what do you do for work?

16
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,960
And I'm like, dude, I literally post about it every day and it's really annoying for

17
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,840
me, I can't imagine how annoying it is for everybody else.

18
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:17,160
So in an effort to let everybody know what it is I do, number one, number two, is I've

19
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,800
realized that when you start a business, when you start doing something that no one knows

20
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:26,600
about or that's new, there's kind of like four stages that you go through.

21
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,840
And here's the four stages that I went through.

22
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,360
Number one is it was like, I told everyone, hey, I'm going to start doing this thing where

23
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,480
I'm going to start renting these websites and building these websites.

24
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,440
It's kind of like real estate, but it's on which websites.

25
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,720
And I was like really excited.

26
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,320
And then people would just like crap on me.

27
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,760
They're like, oh, that's cool, bro.

28
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:46,840
But like, is that like, is that a viable business?

29
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,640
You know what I mean?

30
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,400
Like, is that really a way to make money?

31
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:54,680
I remember specifically somebody said that to me and really just pissed me off when I

32
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,120
was like, dude, I really, you just gave me motivation.

33
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,520
So that's kind of the first stage that you go through.

34
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,040
Then it was like, you start making money and people that they're like, well, he's either

35
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:10,280
lying or maybe he's making money, but it's because of these reasons that make it so that

36
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,000
he's a, he's an anomaly and no one else could do it.

37
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,960
It's just him, right?

38
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:19,960
Then what happens is you start to teach or have other people that you know, do it like

39
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,400
you Porter Porter started doing this.

40
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,840
He's making 10 K a month.

41
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,200
Our other brother, Zach started doing this.

42
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,480
He got up to three K a month before he got distracted.

43
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,800
I've had friends do it.

44
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,800
I've had all kinds of different stuff.

45
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,640
And then what happens is people like, all right, I'm going to start paying a little

46
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,600
bit more attention.

47
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,240
Right.

48
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:41,080
And then the fourth stage, which is what we're finally at, is that people look at it

49
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,720
and they're like, all right, it's legitimate.

50
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:48,760
If it weren't, then his brother and his friends wouldn't be doing it and talk about

51
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,240
it as well.

52
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,480
And I'm also sick of what I'm doing as a job or as a 95.

53
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,760
So let me check this thing out.

54
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,920
And so, and how can I learn?

55
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,960
That's kind of the stage.

56
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,200
Finally, I've been doing this for nine years.

57
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,200
That's finally where I've gotten to.

58
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,840
And so that's a little bit more fun to talk about.

59
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:10,040
But guys, no matter what stage you're at of this, I think you're going to find this

60
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:10,600
interesting.

61
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,920
And so just to kind of give you a little bit of background, I've worked with single moms,

62
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,640
single dads.

63
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,480
I've worked with millionaire business owners.

64
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,480
I've worked with real estate investors.

65
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,680
I work with doctors.

66
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:25,560
I've worked with like professional lawyers, college students, broke college students,

67
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:30,200
corporate American, nine to five people climbing the ladder and everything in between.

68
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:35,400
And one of those people that I've worked with or that I've like brought into this is

69
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,120
Porter, who like I told you, is my little brother.

70
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:43,800
And I wanted to specifically bring Porter on because not when Porter started doing this,

71
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,920
which was what, two years ago?

72
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,280
Yeah, like two years ago.

73
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:56,280
Not only did he had no sales experience, but he also had like negative tech experience.

74
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,440
Like that's right around two years ago.

75
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,000
It's right around the time you got your first like smartphone, right?

76
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,880
Basically, yeah, legit.

77
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,560
Yeah, between the two of us, not really.

78
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:13,880
I'm not saying that we have a combined ACT score that we're going to put on our Facebook page.

79
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,440
We're not technical people.

80
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:16,760
Okay.

81
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:20,920
And so whenever you bring somebody like me or Porter, it's like, all right, these guys

82
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,360
are just simple people.

83
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,720
If they can do it, I can do it.

84
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:28,760
So now guys, Porter, two years later, he makes $10,000 per month of renting these simple

85
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,160
websites.

86
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,440
We're going to show you one of these websites.

87
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,520
In fact, maybe I'll do that first.

88
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,520
But basically, I brought Porter on.

89
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:39,640
I want to just like have him share his experience, having no experience, no technical experience,

90
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,280
how he's been able to do it, ask him a few questions.

91
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,440
And then also one thing you should know, I'm going to show you guys an example,

92
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,840
is Porter doesn't do this full-time.

93
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,480
This is something that he does kind of on the side.

94
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,280
He works on the family farm.

95
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,320
He's taken over the family farm.

96
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,280
That's his main priority.

97
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:00,680
So this is like a part-time thing for him and which I think is very interesting to note

98
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,840
because he's not doing this full-time.

99
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:07,400
So a lot of you guys might be watching this and you have full-time jobs, which I know

100
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:12,120
you do because you're on this YouTube live right now, which means you're trying to escape

101
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,360
work and you're getting paid to do it.

102
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,200
But anyway, let me show you a quick example.

103
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,680
And then Porter, I'm going to pepper you with some questions.

104
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:25,400
Also on that note, Porter, as he's built this $10,000 per month business, he's also

105
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,360
got married.

106
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,520
He has a baby, how old is your baby, four months?

107
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,600
Four months old.

108
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,320
Amazing, dude.

109
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:35,480
So for those of you that are like, I have kids and I don't have time, whatever your

110
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,120
excuse is, you do have time, okay?

111
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,360
Okay, Porter, can you see my screen?

112
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,440
Yeah, I can see it.

113
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,280
I'm going to give you just a quick example.

114
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,000
This is what we do.

115
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,120
Basically, we build simple websites.

116
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,880
We get them to the top of Google.

117
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,040
And then when people call those websites, we get paid.

118
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,440
Very simple.

119
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:59,720
We build, rent, and rank simple websites, simple web assets.

120
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,280
We're website rental people.

121
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,320
We're middlemen.

122
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,360
We're whatever.

123
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,720
Basically, we're putting a customer and a business owner together using a website.

124
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:13,480
And you're going to see here in a second, we're anything but web designers, okay?

125
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:17,640
So I'm going to show you one of my ugliest websites I've ever produced my entire life.

126
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:23,240
If you type in tow truck St. George, Utah, towing St. George, Utah,

127
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,960
all the stuff around towing, you're going to go here.

128
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,680
And this very first listing here says towing St. George.

129
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:36,440
If you click on this, you're going to come across an absolute banger of a website, okay?

130
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,920
As you can see, this is a template that I use from a platform called Weebly.

131
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:45,400
And I know there's people on there right now that are probably like, oh my gosh,

132
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,040
how are you even making money on this?

133
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,400
That's the point.

134
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,920
I'm going to talk about that in a second.

135
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,480
By the way, Kevin Saba, my friend from Sierra Leone.

136
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:53,960
What's up, bro?

137
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,000
Is this come to crypto?

138
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,800
Kevin, I'm going to let you keep crypto because I'm Mr. Shiny Object.

139
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,800
If I get into crypto, then I'm going to go down the rabbit hole, not make any money.

140
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,160
And I'm eventually going to come back here.

141
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:10,120
So for now, I'm sticking with tried and true steady eddy.

142
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,400
You guys can keep all the money on the Trump and the Melania coin.

143
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,400
But when I come back to Sierra Leone, I do want to talk to you.

144
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,520
So this website right here, basically how it works.

145
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,960
If Porter gets, let's just actually use a different example.

146
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,680
Kevin Sessions.

147
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,480
What's up, dude?

148
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:30,040
Kevin Sessions from Cedar City driving to Vegas breaks down in St. George last exit.

149
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,920
He goes online.

150
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,840
He types in tow truck near me.

151
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,960
He comes to my website.

152
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,320
He calls this number.

153
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,000
I get paid, right?

154
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,040
That's it.

155
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,160
That's the whole model.

156
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:43,960
Now, just you guys have a little bit of context because I was curious exactly how much

157
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,800
we're making from this website.

158
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,520
I'm going to tell you the exact number that we're making per month and the exact amount

159
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,920
of money that we've made all time on this little website.

160
00:07:54,200 --> 00:08:00,360
So I am making right now gross $500 per month.

161
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,880
I know it doesn't sound like a lot, but $500 per month.

162
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:09,000
And I have all time on this little website, which I think we built in 2019.

163
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,760
End of 2019, we've made $25,175.

164
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,640
Not bad for this.

165
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,200
Right?

166
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:22,680
To put it in context, okay, the last real estate property that I bought.

167
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,640
And when I say the last, I don't have hundreds of properties, I have four.

168
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,760
So let me not make this sound like I have like a bunch of property.

169
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:33,320
But the last one I bought, it was $415,000, 20% down.

170
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,320
So I put $80,000 into it.

171
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:41,640
I don't rent it out because there is a long story.

172
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,840
I don't rent it out to anyone.

173
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,800
I just have it.

174
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,640
But I priced it out.

175
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:49,720
If I were to rent it out, the most amount of money I'm going to make on that is like,

176
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,440
if I'm lucky, $150 a month, right?

177
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:58,280
So I'm making three times more on this stupid little website than I am on a property that

178
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:05,400
I put $80,000 into and I pay HOA and I'm legally liable for all this different stuff.

179
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,360
I have to pay the note.

180
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,160
I'm on the hook for this website right here.

181
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,480
Cost me $80 to build.

182
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,200
$80, not $70, not $90, $80.

183
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:18,680
And by the way, I did a breakdown of it.

184
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,720
You can go to Spotify and type in digital real estate secrets.

185
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,520
You guys can check it out.

186
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,360
I broke down how much it would cost to build it.

187
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,880
$80 to build this.

188
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,960
Sweat equity probably 40 to 60 hours.

189
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,800
That's maybe $25,000.

190
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,400
And it's just on Senate and forget it.

191
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,920
So this thing, while I'm talking right now, this is bringing in phone calls.

192
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,800
While I'm sleeping, while I'm traveling, this is bringing in phone calls.

193
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:43,160
So the game is what we in Porter do is we just go and find cities and niches

194
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,400
where we can build these little websites, rank them really quickly,

195
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,120
find business owners that want these jobs.

196
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,800
And then we just forward the calls to the business owner and we get paid.

197
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,520
Okay.

198
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,880
So that's the model.

199
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,520
Did I miss anything, Porter?

200
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,320
No, that's perfect.

201
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,560
So I want to ask you some questions.

202
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,440
And by the way, anyone else that's on this call right now,

203
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:10,600
we've got Abu Bakar Ba, I'm guessing from Sierra Leone.

204
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,560
What's up, brother?

205
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,360
Zane Wilson.

206
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:12,840
What's going on?

207
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,520
Hope the moves going well, dude.

208
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:18,520
Tong Yang, Peter Bassi from Sierra Leone, Nick Maxwell.

209
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,360
If you guys have questions for Porter, great.

210
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,160
If not, you guys can just enjoy what he's about to say.

211
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,360
I've got some quick questions for you.

212
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,400
All honest, straight up.

213
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,680
Give me your real answers.

214
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,880
No sugar coating, no fluff.

215
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,380
Okay.

216
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,540
Sure.

217
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,500
Can you confirm how much you're making?

218
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:42,380
And can you also let people know that I have never helped you on any deal?

219
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:45,580
And by the way, Simon says hi, Nick and Kyle.

220
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:46,460
This is not Kyle.

221
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,220
Kyle's about twice as tall as this guy.

222
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,620
And he's like twice his age.

223
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,140
But this is Porter, my little brother.

224
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,580
They're nice to see you on, Simon.

225
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,860
Porter, how much you make it?

226
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:57,980
And sorry, how much you make it?

227
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,660
And can you confirm that you're doing this part time?

228
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,100
Just so that we were like on the same page.

229
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:02,540
Yeah.

230
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,860
So I'm making a little over 10K per month.

231
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:05,500
And what?

232
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,380
Give us an exact figure so people don't think that you're wrong, bro.

233
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,260
Sorry, say that you cut out like what?

234
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:11,980
What's your exact number?

235
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:12,620
Is it 10 and four?

236
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,660
Was that what it was?

237
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:16,140
It's 107, 10,000, 700.

238
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,340
10,700.

239
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,140
Okay.

240
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,300
And you're doing this part time, correct?

241
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:21,580
Yes.

242
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,460
Doing this part time.

243
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:26,940
And you, it's honestly, I was kind of mad at first because like, bro, you know exactly

244
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,060
how to do this business model.

245
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:31,820
Why don't you just like share these little secrets or like give me a little referral

246
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,260
on a few of these business owners?

247
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:38,140
But it's been so much more, it's been way more fulfilling to do it myself because I

248
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:42,140
actually am like so bought into it now because it took me as long as it did.

249
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:45,340
And I don't feel like I would have appreciated it as much if you would have helped me.

250
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,820
So yeah, I've given him no referrals.

251
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,340
In fact, I probably answer his calls less than anybody.

252
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:54,700
I've closed none of his deals, nothing, like zero.

253
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:55,500
Okay.

254
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,860
So for those of you that are like, oh, big brother, no, didn't do that at all.

255
00:11:58,860 --> 00:11:59,100
Okay.

256
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,740
And I will do that for you, but I'll make you pay me for it, right?

257
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:02,540
I'm sure you know that.

258
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:05,420
Okay.

259
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:09,020
Next one I've got is honest, honest, honest.

260
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:13,820
When you, because Porter, when I first started doing this, for real, Porter was on his

261
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,340
mission in Colorado.

262
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:17,180
He got back.

263
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,700
He knew what kind of what I was doing.

264
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:22,300
Truth be told, did you think that this was a bag of crap, what I was doing?

265
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,660
Or did you think it was legit?

266
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,260
Or would you just like, you just didn't know?

267
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,300
I honestly didn't even know what you did.

268
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,300
Like for the longest time, like it was funny.

269
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:33,100
I always thought you did something like for only one niche.

270
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:36,940
Like I knew bits and pieces about kind of what you did, but I had zero interest.

271
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,460
I had zero like, oh, that's cool.

272
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,060
You know, my brother's doing well.

273
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:43,500
And then I came home and then I was like, dude, life's expensive.

274
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,100
Being married is expensive.

275
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,020
Like I got to start making more money.

276
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,740
And then I was like, Nick, like, what are you actually doing?

277
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:52,300
And probably like most of you guys, you don't really care until you're like, dude,

278
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,580
like you're, what are you doing?

279
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,620
So that was kind of the interest I would say.

280
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:00,380
Like when I first like heard about it, it was almost like too good to be true.

281
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,900
I was like, dude, is this actually legit?

282
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,260
Like this seems so fake.

283
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:08,380
Like how do you have this website and you're making that kind of income per month?

284
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,620
Like that just doesn't make any sense to me.

285
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,180
You know what I'm saying?

286
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:13,260
Like it doesn't, it just seems too good to be true.

287
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,420
Yeah, no, for sure.

288
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,140
Porter Pelfett thought I was up to some shady stuff.

289
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:21,180
He's like, there's no way you're making money renting out these simple websites.

290
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,940
Um, okay.

291
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,860
I'm just going to go through these as fast as I can.

292
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,020
Cause I see some questions people have, which we're going to get to.

293
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,060
So Moza, I see you.

294
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:30,220
I've got a question is I'm going to address her in a second.

295
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:37,100
Um, truthfully, how has making an extra 10 K per month changed your life?

296
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:40,780
And I'll mean that in a cheesy way, but I mean like, what is, has it,

297
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:44,060
has it been like a breath of fresh air to giving you more flexibility?

298
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,660
Has it given you more confidence?

299
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,220
Like what was it?

300
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:49,500
Has it done for you personally, been able to make an extra $10,000 per month?

301
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:53,020
Which by the way, for somebody that, how old are you?

302
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:58,380
23, 24, 24 years old, married kid.

303
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:05,820
Uh, just 10 K on its own is, I mean, it's not, it's not the end all be all,

304
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:06,940
but that's not a bad thing.

305
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,140
You didn't go to college.

306
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,620
You don't have a degree, you know?

307
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:17,020
Um, so that even without the farming stuff, that's, that's not a bad little gig,

308
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:19,980
but yeah, how's it, what's it done for you and the family and your life?

309
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,300
It's been game changer.

310
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:26,860
I really, uh, I didn't realize how much I, I, you needed it.

311
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,300
Like I felt like I was like, oh, I could live.

312
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,740
Like when I first moved out, I got an apartment, like half of it went to rent,

313
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,380
half it went to the food of the insurance, the whatever.

314
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,380
And then I was like, dude, life with like a couple hundred bucks.

315
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,980
I'm like, dude, this is not okay.

316
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,100
Like this is stressful.

317
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:43,260
So to be able to make that kind of money, it takes a little bit off my shoulders to

318
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,860
make me feel like, okay, like this is good.

319
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:49,500
But also like I've got way more confidence in my ability to be able to make money.

320
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:55,180
Like I think my biggest thing was again, being in this bubble and not being able

321
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:58,140
to realize like the kind of money that's actually out there.

322
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:01,900
Like all you see is what's in front of you until you actually start being around

323
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,060
other people that are making this kind of money.

324
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:08,140
And it just like made me realize that like, dude, I can do more and I should expect

325
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:11,180
more out of life than just the use.

326
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:12,940
Yeah, I like that.

327
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,540
Did you have any experience building websites?

328
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:21,180
Did you even know how to log on like search?

329
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,020
I had some party on my phone for the longest time.

330
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:29,340
You gave me crowd for it because Chrome was the way to go.

331
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,940
But no, I had zero tech experience.

332
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:31,900
Like I didn't even have a lap.

333
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:36,060
I didn't own a laptop until like two years ago.

334
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,340
Seriously, or like anything like I didn't have anything.

335
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,980
And so I still am like.

336
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:47,020
I was just going to say this is one that a lot of people, I think they get intimidated.

337
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:51,260
They're like, yeah, I don't mind talking to people, but I don't know how to build a website.

338
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:53,260
I don't know how to do this thing called SEO.

339
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:58,540
I don't know how to any of this technical guys.

340
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:01,180
This business model isn't near as technical as you might think.

341
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:05,740
When I started, I actually didn't know what SEO stood for, which you might not either.

342
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,580
It stands for search engine optimization.

343
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:12,700
I didn't know what a domain was, which by the way, is just the website, the www dot whatever.

344
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,900
That's the domain.

345
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,740
I didn't know any of this stuff.

346
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:17,580
And here I am.

347
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:21,500
I'm like, yeah, I'm going to go start renting simple websites, building and renting simple websites.

348
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:25,500
So now I look back and I can see why people were like, dude, you're crazy because it made no sense.

349
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:29,740
But neither of us had any technical experience.

350
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:37,260
So Porter, from somebody really speaking, let's say that they're, I don't know.

351
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:45,420
40 to 50 years old, never built a website, probably not been at social media,

352
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:48,300
you know, whatever has to have their wife or husband log in for them.

353
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:54,220
How realistic is it for them to be able to be, to build one of these like websites

354
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,780
if they've gotten no experience actually like.

355
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:00,860
I think easy.

356
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:04,860
I definitely it's literally drag and drop depending on the platform you use.

357
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:09,100
I mean, you literally could go look at someone's website and say, hey, this looks good.

358
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,740
And then kind of like mimic how it looks or whatever.

359
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,540
But it's so easy.

360
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:16,300
You really don't need to over complicate it.

361
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,940
It's such a simple process that a lot of us get so scared.

362
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,020
But yeah, you could do that easy.

363
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:22,960
Okay.

364
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,700
Guys, I second that.

365
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:32,380
I think if I took my son, he's 11.

366
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,540
Oh yeah, he's going to be 12.

367
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:39,260
I think without question that I could put him through my training and

368
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:45,260
he would have a website at the end that would rank like that's how you know.

369
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,940
So anyway, I think you're right.

370
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:51,020
Did you have doubts about building and renting simple websites

371
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:54,380
when you started like what or what were your doubts?

372
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:57,500
Because for me, it makes to me, it makes total sense.

373
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,420
I made I make all my money doing this.

374
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,500
It's provided my lifestyle.

375
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,980
I bought real estate, real estate properties, all this kind of stuff.

376
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,140
That doesn't even cross my mind.

377
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:09,260
But I think when I started, I looked around.

378
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,300
It's not that I thought people were lying.

379
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:16,460
I just thought like, maybe everyone else can do it.

380
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:17,180
I can't.

381
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,540
Did you have any doubts when you started?

382
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,860
Yeah, well, dude, the only job I ever had was working on the farm.

383
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,340
And so to kind of be for you to be able to say,

384
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,740
you could make money on a computer or whatever.

385
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,580
Like you almost just think like, yeah, that's good.

386
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:33,820
But like not from from from my personality or this type of lifestyle.

387
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:34,320
Right.

388
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:37,420
So like when I did it, I was like, it's just it's just too complicated.

389
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,060
It's like I would do it.

390
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:40,700
But I also was afraid because I was like everything that I

391
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,380
the money that I made, I worked for.

392
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,140
Like I literally physically went and did it.

393
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,660
And then I got paid for it.

394
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:48,140
And so like to have that that like reincorporating income

395
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:50,060
was kind of like mind blowing to me.

396
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:54,140
And also starting out at however old I was and to have that money,

397
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,420
I was scared to like.

398
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,420
And this is like my first venture, you could say.

399
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,140
So maybe someone.

400
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:04,380
Oh, but for me, that seemed pretty big to be able to spend me.

401
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,980
And then expect to get it back.

402
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,980
Right. Because you don't have much to begin with.

403
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,620
And then to hopefully get it back, like if I make it work.

404
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,460
Right. And that was my I think.

405
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,700
And then finally, when it changed was when I was like, dude,

406
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,580
I'm going to do exactly what everything that you say,

407
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,020
exactly how it's supposed to be done.

408
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,420
And I don't care how long it takes.

409
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:25,340
And it finally just like every, every, every month or every day I did it,

410
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:28,460
I got more and more like bought into it.

411
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,220
And it finally just clicked for me.

412
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:32,460
And I was like, I'm just going to give everything I have.

413
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:35,420
And you just starts to fall into place.

414
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,980
So Porter, somebody guys that he has a really hard time sitting still.

415
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,020
If we're playing more games as a family, which I do not like to do, by the way.

416
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,620
So it's very rare nowadays.

417
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:54,860
But back when I used to semi enjoy this, he'll literally in between every turn,

418
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,820
he has to stand up.

419
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:56,620
He's walking around.

420
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:57,740
He's on his phone.

421
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:58,940
He cannot sit still.

422
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,780
So I remember your concern at the beginning was like,

423
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:03,740
how am I going to sit at a computer and do this?

424
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:04,940
How have you been able to do this?

425
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:09,660
I've never even asked you because it's very tough for you to like sit down and do this.

426
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:14,460
You're more of the go out, be on the tractor, move pipe, do that kind of stuff.

427
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,220
So this wasn't, I know you were worried about that.

428
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:21,020
How have you been able to, I mean, if you're taking Adderall or something,

429
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,460
you can just go ahead and let us know right now.

430
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,420
But what's the secret?

431
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,460
Oh, dude, I honestly, it's weird.

432
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:29,340
But I feel like the, by the way, I do better.

433
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,180
I'm not taking Adderall.

434
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,900
If Porter took Adderall, dude, he'd be off the freaking walls.

435
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,020
He needs the opposite of Adderall.

436
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:35,820
Here you go.

437
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:36,540
Yeah.

438
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:43,500
But anyways, I honestly do better when I actually, it's funny because I farm full time.

439
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:47,420
I feel like that honestly is the best thing for me because I need to be able to have that kind

440
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:52,540
of escape of like do something with my body, get outside, like get my mind clear

441
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,220
and come back to the computer.

442
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:59,660
And it's like those like couple hours, like people that are watching this,

443
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:02,380
it's like you have such an advantage because like you're so dead.

444
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:06,940
That's what kind of pushed me was like, hey, I don't want to get out of this,

445
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:10,220
but I want to be able to like not rely on this source of income.

446
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:13,180
I want to completely like live my life off this.

447
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:16,860
And so like that kind of motivated me, but like I would do it for a couple hours a day,

448
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:20,860
but I felt like I got more out of the two hours at night after I got done farming,

449
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:25,260
then I did the eight hours of sitting at my computer because I can't focus for that long.

450
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,100
Like I literally can't just sit down for eight hours.

451
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:31,500
Like I have to do 30 minutes, go do something, 30 minutes, do something, but I can't do it.

452
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:36,620
So for me, it's just like do something, go work out, do whatever I need to do, sit down,

453
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:40,780
say, hey, I got two hours and I get so much more done in two hours than I did eight hours.

454
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,060
I agree.

455
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,260
I'm a little bit like that too.

456
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:45,420
Okay.

457
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:49,260
I have just a couple more questions and then I want you to show one of your websites that you built

458
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:54,540
and you can tell us, you can be one you're most proud of, the one that's the ugliest.

459
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:57,420
And I want you to tell everyone how much you're making for that website,

460
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,620
but a couple of quick questions.

461
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,700
How long did it actually take you to build your first site?

462
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:10,700
Probably took me like realistically, probably like to build it out like a month

463
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:13,100
and then to do all the other jazz, you know, it was just kind of slow.

464
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,060
I'd say like a month.

465
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:16,620
And working on that, that was like two hours a day.

466
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:17,900
Yeah.

467
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:18,540
Yeah.

468
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:19,500
Okay.

469
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,340
I already asked that question.

470
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:26,780
What do you think is the biggest reason that people don't start doing this?

471
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,300
So I have people all the time.

472
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:32,380
They're like, I'll have people message and again, this isn't like a ton of people,

473
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:38,780
but occasionally people will message me and say, hey man, I see what you're up to

474
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:40,940
and I'm wondering if it's something that I can do.

475
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:41,580
I'm interested.

476
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,180
I hate my job, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

477
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,860
And then I like, I never hear back from them.

478
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:53,100
So I guess at some point they just like get spooked or they get sidetracked or whatever.

479
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,420
What do you think is the biggest reason people don't start doing this?

480
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:01,820
I think it's a fear of failing.

481
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:02,380
I really do.

482
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:06,540
I think it's like, I don't want to try something and then it's worked for us.

483
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:11,260
And so like, if it doesn't work for them, it's going to be maybe embarrassing in a way.

484
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:14,620
Like I almost just feel like it's this lack of trust in themselves.

485
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:20,220
In securities and it could be the money, but like you really can't argue with the

486
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,540
fact that it costs $80 to build this website.

487
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,180
You know what I'm saying?

488
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:26,220
Like literally the numbers, it's like a no brainer.

489
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:29,660
But to someone, I just feel like it comes down to the excuse of like,

490
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:33,420
oh, well he's got sales experience or he is Nick's brother or he's whatever.

491
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:36,860
But it's like, if you don't make it work, like it's on you.

492
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:39,100
It's not really the idea.

493
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,500
You know, that's what I feel like why a lot of people fail.

494
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,860
And a lot of people are just in their heads.

495
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,460
They overthink the whole thing.

496
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:47,660
And I think if you could just kind of dumb it down a little bit and just be like,

497
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,780
dude, you could figure this out.

498
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:52,380
It might take you a little bit longer than some of us, but like you'll figure it out.

499
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:52,620
Yeah.

500
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:58,140
What do you think is the biggest reason people fail that start doing this?

501
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,380
We've all, by the way, just everybody knows.

502
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,860
Not everybody that does this goes and makes 10K.

503
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,140
Not everybody does this goes.

504
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,060
I mean, we have extremes.

505
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:08,780
I have one guy that he started working.

506
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,860
We started teaching him two years ago.

507
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:13,340
He's doing $87,000 per month.

508
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:14,860
Insane.

509
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,100
We've also got people quarter knows.

510
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:20,860
I know that come in and every reason to succeed and then they fail.

511
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:22,540
Why do you think that is?

512
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:25,580
What's the biggest reason people fail that the ones that do start doing this?

513
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,700
What's the biggest reason they fail?

514
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,420
I think they get shiny object syndrome.

515
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:33,580
I think they, they joined the course excited.

516
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:38,220
They realized that, hey, it's, it's harder than they expected, which I think.

517
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:41,820
Yeah, it's simple, but it's not like, you know, you have to do some work.

518
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:44,300
It's not like it's, hey, as soon as you build a website, like,

519
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,740
no more, you don't have to ever look at it.

520
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:48,380
Like there, there's definitely some things you have to upkeep, right?

521
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:48,860
It's a business.

522
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:53,260
So there's like pullbacks and setbacks, but I think a lot of people will join

523
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,260
and they don't see results right away.

524
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,300
And so they jump ship.

525
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:59,980
They find something else and they're like, I could maybe do this like a lot faster.

526
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:03,100
When in reality, this took me two years and I'm making 10K.

527
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:06,060
That's really not that long.

528
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:06,300
Really?

529
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,940
When you think about it, like, I know a lot of us want to make it like

530
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:12,220
in the next two months, but it's like, I mean, I'll take it.

531
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,300
Obviously, I want to do a lot more than that.

532
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:18,620
But like, even if I was to do 10K every two years, I mean, I'm pretty happy.

533
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:21,260
You know, for sure.

534
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,620
I mean, if you're comparing that to like a job,

535
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:30,380
let's say you're out of school and you're, let's say your entry level

536
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:33,180
position is 10K a month, which means you have a really good degree

537
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:35,740
and you're probably living in a city that you may or may not want to live in.

538
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,660
And your costs are probably really expensive.

539
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:41,580
You're definitely not doing 10K a month working at a job

540
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,620
in Peru and Utah.

541
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,660
That's just for sure.

542
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,100
Yeah.

543
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:50,460
But let's say you do, like, for you to get to 20K, for you to double your income

544
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,580
is almost impossible.

545
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,860
If you do, it's going to take you 10 years kissing a lot of butt,

546
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:57,500
shaking hands, going to all the meetings, not pissing anyone off,

547
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:01,420
not having any political views, go to the bathroom when you're told to go,

548
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:04,940
only taking vacay, like just it's a mess and you can get fired at any point.

549
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:07,900
So I wouldn't say it's too bad if two years were to work.

550
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:08,460
You know what I mean?

551
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:09,740
Yeah.

552
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:14,860
So here's what I want to do, finish your thought and I've got two things

553
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:17,180
I want to do, we'll end this live and then if anyone has questions.

554
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:25,180
No, I was just going to say, I think that if you guys actually had a desire

555
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:29,500
to start a business, I think if you guys really checked all the boxes

556
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:32,140
that you guys want in a business, I think you guys would really realize

557
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:34,300
that this could work for literally anybody.

558
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:39,260
We have people that do this that are firemen that are, I mean, I'm farming.

559
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:43,020
Police officers, like whatever you can, you can possibly name it.

560
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,300
That's what's cool is I get it.

561
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:47,580
You get to rub shoulders with people that, you know, wouldn't normally

562
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:52,860
rub shoulders with and that every personality out there from 80 years old,

563
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,620
what's our oldest person that does this?

564
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:58,620
I don't know, but like pretty old, you know, and then down to we had

565
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,140
a 16 year old that was landing deals.

566
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:06,060
Yeah, I mean, definitely a few in the 60s.

567
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,340
I think we had one guy in the 70s.

568
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:08,220
I don't know 80.

569
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:12,540
Maybe not 80, but 80 might be a little bit.

570
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,300
You might be over the hump at 80.

571
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,020
No, I'm kidding.

572
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:17,820
If you're 80 and you want to do this, I promise you I'll work with your hands

573
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:20,220
on it because that'd be a sick case study.

574
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:24,460
We start slinging this to a whole new audience.

575
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:25,180
You know what I'm saying?

576
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,780
No, it doesn't matter what age you are.

577
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:29,580
If you're willing to learn, it's cool.

578
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:31,340
It's doable, right?

579
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:37,020
Especially for two people coming from Parawant, Utah.

580
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,620
Evil waters, baby.

581
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:39,420
You know what I'm saying?

582
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,380
Shout out to Parawant, by the way.

583
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,180
It was an amazing childhood.

584
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:47,500
So I just, you know, just having fun.

585
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:52,300
So Porter, I want you to show one of your websites that you've built

586
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:55,740
with your own hands, your own money that's making you money.

587
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:59,260
And I'm going to ask you a final question as we sail off into the sunset.

588
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,340
It's 848 where I'm at in Dubai.

589
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,140
Porter's in Parawant, Utah.

590
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:02,940
What time is it there, dude?

591
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,380
It is 948.

592
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,020
948.

593
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:07,740
You're starting today.

594
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,700
I'm just really getting done.

595
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,700
So I'm going to give you co-hosts.

596
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,900
I want you to show one of your sites.

597
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:13,660
Okay.

598
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,180
Real quick.

599
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:19,100
I could even give you one that I'm building right now.

600
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:20,780
Let's show.

601
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:23,740
Do you have one that's, show, just show us the site real quick.

602
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,940
Go look, what's, oh, you want to give me the domain?

603
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:27,900
You want to give me the domain?

604
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:28,860
I'll log, I'll check it out.

605
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:34,940
Yeah, do Lawrencevilleconcrete.com.

606
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:38,940
Lawrencevilleconcrete.com.

607
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:42,220
Okay.

608
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,820
Let me see if it goes to it really quick.

609
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:44,860
Then I'll share my screen.

610
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:48,780
I can guarantee you Porter just gave you his best site.

611
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:51,340
So whatever this is, just guarantee this is the best one.

612
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:52,620
There's no way he gave us his ugliest.

613
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:55,580
Just kidding.

614
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:56,700
All right.

615
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,260
This one up?

616
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,220
Yeah, that's it.

617
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:01,180
Okay.

618
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,740
So check this bad boy out.

619
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:08,380
It's actually pretty sound.

620
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:13,740
It's not, you know, obviously isn't a web design beauty or anything like that, but

621
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:14,700
it looks better than mine.

622
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,660
I'll buy a long shot.

623
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:18,220
He's got his tracking number here.

624
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,740
He's got his little quote form.

625
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:20,860
He's got his content.

626
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:24,780
He's actually got some really, if you, you might not know this because

627
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:28,060
you wouldn't know what to look for, but he's actually done a really sound SEO.

628
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:31,180
I can just tell with some of the stuff he has up in the heading.

629
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:32,620
I'm sorry.

630
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:35,180
In the page description up here.

631
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,500
But actually this is pretty solid.

632
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,700
So how much is this little website making you per month?

633
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:46,060
This one right here is making me 1600 per month.

634
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:48,780
$1,600 per month.

635
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:49,980
Where's Lawrenceville by the way?

636
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:50,940
Yes.

637
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:55,980
That's in, uh, it's kind of outside of Atlanta, like a little suburb.

638
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:57,900
So this is in Georgia.

639
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:58,140
Okay.

640
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,940
Lawrenceville concrete.

641
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:02,620
Every time that phone number rings.

642
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:07,180
Porter's bank account gets a little, gets a little dingle.

643
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:11,660
It gets a little, a little bumpy every time he's golfing.

644
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:14,300
He's on the tractor and that phone number rings.

645
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,500
He's getting paid.

646
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,300
Right.

647
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:20,860
I kind of look at this like, um, kind of like, uh, Porter, you've seen

648
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,900
despicable me, obviously.

649
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:28,220
So I can get these minions, dude, that are out there and they're literally

650
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:29,260
just doing work for you.

651
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:32,940
But the difference is the minions have like feelings and stuff like that.

652
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,140
These guys have no feelings.

653
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,020
They don't need holidays.

654
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,060
They don't need vacations.

655
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:36,780
They're just working.

656
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:39,180
You build them, you set them free.

657
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:42,460
They go make you money and you could, you could build as many as you want.

658
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:45,260
So, um, yeah, that's it guys.

659
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:45,900
Super simple.

660
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:48,060
So we got Zach, uh, Zach Porter.

661
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:48,780
Sorry, dude.

662
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:55,100
Sorry, by the way, um, sorry to call you that, bud.

663
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,820
I got a little confused a little later here.

664
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:58,620
No, it's okay.

665
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:02,780
What advice would you give somebody watching this right now that is

666
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:04,220
contemplating jumping into this?

667
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:07,100
And then I'm going to go to Moses got a question, but what advice would

668
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:11,340
you give somebody that's contemplating got a little toe dipped in the water

669
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:16,780
thinking about jumping in, but they're nervous for this, that, whatever reason.

670
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,060
What advice would you give them?

671
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:26,620
Uh, I would, I would tell them, look at your life now.

672
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:30,220
If you're happy with where you want to be great, then stay there.

673
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:33,580
But I think most of us want a little bit more out of life than,

674
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:39,580
then sometimes we put out, put out to be, I would say, if you're thinking

675
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:41,740
about doing this, I would say, do it.

676
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:42,940
I said that there's no other bit.

677
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:45,500
Maybe there is a business model, but nothing that I would be interested in,

678
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,620
but like, that is going to be able to make you the amount of money that you

679
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:51,740
can do with being able to do something that you love.

680
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:55,020
For example, I don't know if I could do any other business model while

681
00:31:55,420 --> 00:32:00,700
in love and this passive is a work to it.

682
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:05,020
But like, you basically are checking every box that you possibly could do.

683
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,220
I would say, don't overthink it.

684
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:10,780
If we are literally as you do it for sure, there's plenty of people out

685
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:14,220
there that are testimonials of that, but I wouldn't say just don't overthink.

686
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:21,740
Say, Hey, I got a thousand bucks to, you would be able to, you could land a

687
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,580
deal and you can get a client, you know?

688
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:26,780
So I just, I would say, don't overthink it if I can do it.

689
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:30,620
But I don't go out there.

690
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:31,740
Yeah.

691
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:32,380
I like that.

692
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:33,100
That's good advice.

693
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:34,940
Okay, bro.

694
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:37,740
Moses said, how many customers are rent?

695
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,740
By the way, I know that we're getting a little choppy here.

696
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:42,620
We're about to end this, but he said, how many customers are renting the site?

697
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:44,140
That's one customer, Mozo.

698
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:46,620
So you don't, you could do this however you want.

699
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:48,460
You could rent this to multiple companies.

700
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:53,020
The way that Porter and I structure these is we work with one company per area.

701
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,580
So for example, I know you're in South Africa.

702
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:59,660
Let's say that you wanted to build a Johannesburg tree service site.

703
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:04,300
You would want to work with one company locally and send them all weeks.

704
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:09,020
Now you could split it up, but in my experience, working with one company,

705
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,260
giving them a great service is the best way to do it.

706
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:16,300
And then this follow up question said, is just one customer renting

707
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:19,100
or many renting your site Porter's website?

708
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,660
That is, yeah.

709
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,500
So one customer per website.

710
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:28,780
And there's a lot of reasons why we do that, which I can share with you.

711
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:31,820
So anyway, guys, that's all I wanted to share.

712
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:35,580
If you guys have any questions, Porter, actually, this is one thing

713
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,180
that Porter has been really helpful to do.

714
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:40,620
If people have questions and they just want to ask you,

715
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:43,260
do you want to just, how can they reach out to you?

716
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:46,540
Because he's been a really good, I know a bunch of people

717
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:49,820
in some of the other groups have reached out to him that we're a part of.

718
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:52,140
And he's really cool to just jump on like 15 minute call.

719
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:56,460
Do you want to drop your cell phone number and they can text you or,

720
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,060
and this is, this is actually your cell phone.

721
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:00,300
This isn't like a, this isn't like a trap phone, right?

722
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:04,220
No, this is my personal cell, dude.

723
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:04,780
All right.

724
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:06,380
Just checking this.

725
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:06,780
Thank you.

726
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:07,100
Sure.

727
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,100
But that'll keep you on your toes.

728
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:09,340
Okay.

729
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:15,020
By the way, I'll send you a $10 gift card.

730
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:17,100
If you go put him in one of those drawings in the mall

731
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:21,420
for like the Harley-Davidson, just so he gets spam and dollars for every person.

732
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:24,220
Or insurance, dude.

733
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:25,900
Put me in for that insurance marketplace.

734
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:30,780
Anyway, also, oh, I forgot to do this.

735
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:31,980
Two things.

736
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,020
Well, I'll just say one thing.

737
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,100
I have a bunch of free stuff.

738
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:37,900
I have a YouTube channel and I have a free,

739
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,580
I'll drop the free training really quick.

740
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:45,980
It's, it's called rentsimplesites.com.

741
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:50,460
Just to give you guys an idea, like an overview of what we do.

742
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:56,620
And then we actually just launched this rankandretire.com,

743
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:00,940
which is a community of people that are just kind of getting into this,

744
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:04,940
want to get their feet wet, but aren't quite ready to pull the trigger.

745
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:08,300
I'm like doing this for real for real.

746
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:13,900
You guys can go to rankandretire.com and I don't know if those links pull up for you.

747
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,500
Can you see them on your end quarter?

748
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,460
I don't think it works.

749
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,780
Can you see them in the chat?

750
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:22,940
Okay.

751
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:24,620
No.

752
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:25,020
Awesome.

753
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:26,060
Guys, thanks for being on this call.

754
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,100
Porter, thanks for being on.

755
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,740
And that's it, guys.

756
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:32,220
We'll, we'll see you guys whenever we decide to go live next.

757
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:32,700
Thanks, bro.

758
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:33,180
See you soon.

759
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:34,780
Thanks.

760
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:35,180
Thanks.
