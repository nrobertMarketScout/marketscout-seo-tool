00:00.000 --> 00:04.080
So what I call it means like, Hey, so actually right now, um, I'm grocery shopping with my family.

00:04.080 --> 00:07.600
So we'll do this a little bit later. Okay. I'm like, okay, that's fine. Cool. Hour and a half later,

00:07.600 --> 00:13.600
I call them and nothing. I call them again, like 30 minutes later, nothing and nothing. So,

00:13.600 --> 00:18.080
so at that point, do I just move on to the next person? No. So here's what you need to do. Um,

00:18.880 --> 00:23.040
that's kind of like, cause you kind of got that scent sounds like when you were talking to him,

00:23.040 --> 00:27.520
right? And you kind of tell this kind of a yes, man, he's getting, he's nice, sick. He probably

00:27.520 --> 00:31.680
wouldn't do something to offend you. Kind of a guy like really soft spoken. If I get a guy

00:31.680 --> 00:35.760
like that, because you could bulldog the shit out of those guys, but at the end of the day,

00:35.760 --> 00:39.600
they're not going to give you their credit card. So what I do is I I'm like, Hey, can I,

00:39.600 --> 00:44.960
I can call you back later. I got a job. It's hot. They need a tree removal. I can call you back,

00:44.960 --> 00:49.760
but I also don't want to waste my time or your time. If I call you back, are you going to pick

00:49.760 --> 00:54.560
up or is this just the, this is the no, like it's a soft no. I'll, I'll literally say that because

00:55.360 --> 01:00.000
if not, that guy might not even be following you. And now you're going to be like, Oh, I got somebody,

01:00.000 --> 01:04.880
I got somebody. And you're going to be thinking, Oh, we're good, but you're not. So I would ask

01:04.880 --> 01:09.360
right there and then get your answer. And a lot of times that pullback, they're like, Oh, okay,

01:09.360 --> 01:13.760
this is different. This guy is actually like a real person, not a robot. And, and you'll get them

01:13.760 --> 01:17.520
to answer right there. So that's what I would have done different. I would still keep hitting them.

01:17.520 --> 01:22.560
Maybe like if the lead comes in, do a screenshot, blur out the number. Hey, I got this lead. I want

01:22.560 --> 01:27.360
to send it to you. Can you give me a call? Um, but I, I wouldn't chase them too much. I would just

01:27.360 --> 01:30.400
do, I'd be try some different angles.
