For sure. We got some good questions. So Matthew says, is it viable to try and snatch a few leads

00:04.320 --> 00:09.600
from FBA groups to use also to close deals before ads take off? I remember you did talk

00:09.600 --> 00:13.360
about this. It's pretty hit or miss, but can work. Francesca, what are your thoughts on it?

00:13.360 --> 00:18.560
Did you know what he's asking? You cut out the first half. Is it viable to take,

00:18.560 --> 00:22.480
go into Facebook groups, grab a few free leads and use those to go hook a deal and

00:22.480 --> 00:24.320
get the process going while you're waiting for ads?

00:30.000 --> 00:35.600
Can you repeat it? Sorry. No, you're good. So like, and the, like Facebook groups,

00:35.600 --> 00:40.560
people ask for recommendations like, Hey, who has a local concrete guy, right? Can we use those

00:40.560 --> 00:46.000
leads, those interested people as a form of free leads on our end to give to business owners

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
while we're waiting for ads to take off or even to supplement them to get the deal?

00:50.000 --> 00:55.360
I think so. Yeah. Nick, you did a live on this or YouTube video like last year.

00:55.360 --> 01:03.920
The only thing I like to use Facebook group leads to pick up the slack. I don't like to use

01:03.920 --> 01:10.160
them to start a deal. Sometimes I'll use them to hook a deal to test the market. I don't love,

01:10.160 --> 01:14.720
once I know the market's good to use them, because then if my ads don't kick in, it's like,

01:14.720 --> 01:21.200
I don't have a predictable way to continually just scrape leads. But if I'm running ads and

01:21.200 --> 01:25.280
my ads slow down, it's a great way to go get like some sweat equity deals and go get some

01:25.280 --> 01:32.160
leads that way. So my opinion is hook them, use those leads to get interest, to gauge interest,

01:32.160 --> 01:35.520
to call around, to get somebody on the hook if you need to, if you want to do that without

01:35.520 --> 01:40.880
setting up ads. But I like to have my leads coming in from ads and then use those as a supplement

01:41.440 --> 01:45.760
rather than my main thing, because I don't, I can't predict when people are going to ask

01:45.760 --> 01:50.960
for recommendations, right? So that's just my two cents, but leads are leads guys. It's about

01:50.960 --> 01:56.880
strategy versus tactic. The strategy is giving free leads in advance. The tactic that we're using

01:56.880 --> 02:00.960
is Google ads. But guess what? If you guys can, if somebody in this group can come up with a

02:00.960 --> 02:10.240
predictable, you know, repeatable way to glean and harvest leads out of Facebook groups forever,

02:10.240 --> 02:15.280
and we don't have to run ads, go ahead and hit me up on DMs. And we'll go ahead and implement

02:15.280 --> 02:17.760
that and stop running ads, but ads is just the most predictable thing.
