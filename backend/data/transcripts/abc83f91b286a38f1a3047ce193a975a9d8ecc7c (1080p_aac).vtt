Okay, Simon has an interesting question.

00:01.760 --> 00:04.320
He says, what do you think about e-comm

00:04.320 --> 00:07.120
with the digital asset approach?

00:07.120 --> 00:08.140
Can he do it?

00:09.600 --> 00:13.320
Guys, my answer to this is whether you're asking me

00:13.320 --> 00:16.440
about pull barns, whether you're asking me

00:16.440 --> 00:19.480
about assisted living leads,

00:19.480 --> 00:20.960
whether you're asking me about whatever,

00:20.960 --> 00:25.120
if you use this strategy, which is getting paid traffic

00:25.120 --> 00:28.760
or organic traffic to a landing page or to a website,

00:28.800 --> 00:31.240
you are going to get leads or conversions.

00:31.240 --> 00:32.700
Because if you're selling a product,

00:32.700 --> 00:34.440
the same principles apply.

00:34.440 --> 00:37.980
However, the thing that makes this model so special

00:37.980 --> 00:41.360
is the fact that we can use a generic website.

00:41.360 --> 00:45.580
And if, let's say our client starts to get sideways on us,

00:45.580 --> 00:48.000
they start to get a little funny, they start to complain,

00:48.000 --> 00:50.040
we can sell those leads to somebody else.

00:50.040 --> 00:52.480
So if you do e-comm, let's say you go to a company

00:52.480 --> 00:53.540
and they're like, hey, I want you to sell

00:53.540 --> 00:55.560
these water filters for us, right?

00:55.640 --> 00:58.360
And you're doing all this SEO for these water filters.

00:59.200 --> 01:02.000
That's great, but first of all, first and foremost,

01:02.000 --> 01:04.920
you're probably gonna be doing SEO on like a national level,

01:04.920 --> 01:06.880
which makes it very difficult.

01:06.880 --> 01:09.960
It's gonna be much more difficult to get SEO,

01:09.960 --> 01:13.040
to rank using SEO, to get organic rankings.

01:13.040 --> 01:15.480
The other thing, guys, is that company's kind of gonna

01:15.480 --> 01:17.000
have you buy the balls, right?

01:17.000 --> 01:18.560
Because if you're advertising their products

01:18.560 --> 01:20.400
and you're using their branding or their location

01:20.400 --> 01:24.000
or their specific keywords that they wanna target,

01:24.000 --> 01:26.120
what happens if they don't wanna buy leads anymore?

01:26.120 --> 01:28.480
So you have to remember that one of the best parts

01:28.480 --> 01:30.440
about this business model is the ability

01:30.440 --> 01:33.880
to have complete control over our assets

01:33.880 --> 01:36.600
and not have to be at the mercy of anybody.

01:36.600 --> 01:38.360
And this kind of defeats the purpose of it.

01:38.360 --> 01:39.560
So could it work?

01:39.560 --> 01:40.400
Yes.

01:40.400 --> 01:41.220
Do I recommend it?

01:41.220 --> 01:42.060
No.

01:42.060 --> 01:46.120
If it's your own brand and it's your own e-comm products,

01:46.120 --> 01:48.560
your own e-comm store, your own products,

01:48.560 --> 01:50.940
then okay, fine, use the SEO principles

01:50.940 --> 01:52.480
in the second half of the training

01:52.480 --> 01:54.840
to get your website ranked.

01:54.840 --> 01:56.360
But to do it for somebody else,

01:56.360 --> 01:57.760
I don't think it's the move.
