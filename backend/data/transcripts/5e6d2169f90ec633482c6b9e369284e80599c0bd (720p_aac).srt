1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
Board. Okay, guys, welcome to officially welcome to our call

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,080
today. It is the beautiful month of October 29, two days away

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:18,360
from Halloween. We are almost in the second to last month before

4
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:23,040
this beautiful year ends. For some of you guys, that's a very

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,200
exciting thing, because you're gonna love to close the door on

6
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,240
this, this year. And some of you guys have had the year of your

7
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,160
life. And maybe that's not the case. But time is actually

8
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,560
flying. Lots happened this year, a lot of money's been made, a

9
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:40,120
lot of money's been lost, I'm sure. And here we are. That's

10
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,840
it's actually crazy. Also, I think I might have said this. But

11
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,440
guys, this is just a quick thing I want to say, get creative with

12
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,680
everything you're doing in your business, you need to let people

13
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,120
know what it is that you do. Porter, I told you what we're

14
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:03,880
doing for Halloween. No. So what we decided to do because one

15
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:09,520
of my friends, his father in law has this massive, actually an

16
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,880
orthodontist practice. So maybe you could take this to your

17
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,520
wife's family. But it's a great idea. So what they do every

18
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,600
single year on Halloween is instead of giving out candy, they

19
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,680
give out freaking toothbrushes branded with the company. And I

20
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,160
thought I was thought that was genius. Because think about this

21
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:29,120
500 1000 kids, they're they're dumping their brand in their

22
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,640
home and these toothbrushes are just floating around their house

23
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,120
for the next 365 days. So I was I was like, that's really,

24
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,560
really smart. So this year, because I keep saying I'm going

25
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,600
to do it, I keep saying I'm going to do it. This year, I

26
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,760
went ahead, and I made, like, to well, I don't think it was 650

27
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:50,400
of these things, I made $2,000 worth of Rubik's cubes, branded

28
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,560
with digital landlords. They're pretty dope, dude, they got the

29
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,880
digital landlord, they got the smiley, and we're gonna be

30
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:00,720
popping 650 Rubik's cubes into people's homes. And I'm hoping

31
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,800
that moms are going to trip on them. I'm hoping they're going

32
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,840
to end up in minivans. I'm hoping they're going to end up

33
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,680
at schools. And we're going to spread the gospel of rank and

34
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,480
rent. So just as a heads up, guys, you don't need to go spend

35
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,760
two grand, but get creative and think about opportunities. I got

36
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,800
650 little morons coming to my house. Just kidding. They're not

37
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,200
all morons. But a lot of these are pesky little kids. And

38
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,800
instead of giving them a Twix, that's going to just go go and

39
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,000
ruin their teeth, we're giving them a Rubik's cube, which is

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,480
going to get their minds sharp. And it's going to get the

41
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,880
branding floating through the southern Utah home. So anyway,

42
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,800
stoked about that. Unfortunately, I'm not going to

43
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,200
be there. So I got my son I'm hiring to pass those out. He's

44
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,000
going to forgive, forego the candy, make a little make a

45
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,040
little cheddar and hand those out since I'm in Dubai. But

46
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:51,160
guys, use opportunities that you see fit to talk about what

47
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,680
you're doing. Maybe it's a, you know, it's something in your

48
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,040
town, you can put a booth together. I see these all the

49
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,600
time. And I missed them. Like at my son's school, you can do

50
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:02,960
like a booth and you can give stuff away and whatever. And

51
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,320
they're just good opportunities to, to market your business

52
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,800
because there's a lot of money in your town. I don't even care

53
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,680
like, even where Porter's at, it's a population of like 3000

54
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,200
people or less, there is money in that town. In fact, I have a

55
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,440
client from that town, Mr. Porter. So I think you know who

56
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,320
that is. But anyway, so guys, today, we're gonna be talking

57
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:27,400
about how to almost get to 10k. Porter, why don't you go ahead

58
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:33,800
and share the story. And we are going to just get into this. Now,

59
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,920
from what I understand, technically, the deals not 100%

60
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,840
lost Porter sitting at $9400 per month, that is a gross nut

61
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,600
net, just so everybody knows. But he's at $9400 per month,

62
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,800
he's touched, he's almost touched the outer the outer rim

63
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,240
of the 10,000 multiple times, and he keeps falling a bit

64
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,160
short. So we're going to just rub it in a little bit Porter,

65
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,520
tell us what happened, where we're sitting, and what we can

66
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,240
expect from this deal. But

67
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:06,600
Okay, so I got I got one of this campaign going, it was in

68
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,920
fencing, because I got one in another one in fencing a little

69
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,960
while ago. So hold on, is this, would this be the first fencing

70
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,760
deal you've ever got?

71
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,240
No, this would be my second one.

72
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,880
So you have a client for fencing right now? Beautiful. Okay.

73
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,360
So I was like, I'm just gonna do the same thing. So I go into the

74
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:27,000
area, and the leads were not as heavily coming in as the first

75
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,920
one. So like, it took me a little bit to send this guy some

76
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,640
lead. But anyways, I called him. And it was the first guy I

77
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,720
called, it was, it was like, hey, someone's actually done

78
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,440
this with me before. And actually, it's someone in the

79
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,440
free group. It's fine. I like looked at his Facebook, and I

80
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,080
figured out who it was. But anyways, I figured out that he

81
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,480
had done this. But anyways,

82
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,200
Oh, tell me his name will kick him out right now.

83
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:53,520
Yeah. So he was, he didn't even tell me his name. But anyways, I

84
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,120
knew he, I knew who he was. So I started sending him like two to

85
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,440
three leads, whatever. And then I was like, hey, let's get on a

86
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,960
call. So I scheduled out for like the next day. And we get

87
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,400
on the call, I call him and I send him the zoom link, he

88
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,440
watches the screencast. I'm like, hey, get on the computer.

89
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:12,080
I'm trying to get this thing perfect as I can. Let's set up

90
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,000
like I'm making sure that he watches it. I watched my, my

91
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
screencast, make sure I included everything. And I sent it to him.

92
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,520
He watches it. And I'm like, sweet, I'm ready to go. And I'm

93
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,360
on my computer. I'm waiting. He called me. And he's like, Hey,

94
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,920
the zoom is not working. I'm like, Oh, my gosh. He's like,

95
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,520
yeah, I like I've been answering. And I'm like, Oh, my

96
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,960
gosh, like, for whatever reason, he couldn't figure out zoom. And

97
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,520
it was a Friday. And I was like, dude, I don't want to get this

98
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,880
half a call. So I just was like, well, let's just do it over the

99
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:41,040
phone. So this is where I think I messed up was I should have

100
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:45,120
waited until I got him on zoom. Because this is what happened is

101
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:51,000
we I did the call, I pitched him at two or 375 per month. And so

102
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,280
1500, which would have put you at 11,000, basically. Yeah. And

103
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,720
so like, it's perfect. So I pitched him at it. And he's like,

104
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,720
okay, that sounds good. I was like, am I supposed to be so

105
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,880
he's like, I think it's a master card. Like, oh, sweet. So I got

106
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,960
Yeah, I got him so I wrote his card number down. And then he's

107
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,060
like, I see the money on the car. Okay. So I'm like, okay,

108
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,980
whatever he's like, it's a car that I use them like, but now I

109
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,780
think about it's credit cards should be able to freaking charge.

110
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:18,360
Yeah, that was another car, or for he's on it. Yeah. I was like,

111
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,360
you're full crap anyway. But I didn't think about the, oh, I

112
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,960
got his number? Information? Whatever. So a day goes by, and

113
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,180
um, I keep texting like dude. Are you get the cars? Oh, sorry.

114
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:31,220
I haven't gotten there. And every day, it's like, why send

115
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,980
excuse, excuse. And then finally, it's so hard to get he won't

116
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:37,340
even answer my call. So I'm like, dude, this guy's dog. And

117
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:40,700
so I said, I was like, Hey, did you get my because I was like,

118
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:44,020
maybe I can just have him sign my agreement or my you know, my

119
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:46,780
credit card authorization so that I can just like sleep at

120
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:50,140
night, you know, knowing he signed it. So I send that over.

121
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,220
And he's like, you know, I haven't received it. So I sent a

122
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,940
screenshot of the credit card authorization at the bottom. I

123
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:59,060
said, he will be charged for 375 per month. And he reads it. And

124
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:05,020
he's like, wait, I thought it was $349 per month. And I was

125
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:09,820
like, I was like, what? So he literally he thought it was 349

126
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:14,000
per month. And so the price wasn't right. And it definitely

127
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,940
so he thought it was $1,500 for six months. So I'm like, dude,

128
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:21,140
what the hell do you mean? That is that is not right. So I

129
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,940
explained to him and he was on the fence about it. And I called

130
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,580
him last night, talked to him. And I was like, dude, like,

131
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,940
where are you at? And he wants to do it. And then at the end of

132
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:33,220
the day, he's just he's scared to make money scared to, you

133
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,300
know, spend the money. But anyway, I think the deal is

134
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,860
lost. I sent him a breakup text because I was tired of dealing

135
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:41,100
with him last night. I was like, dude, shit or get off the plot

136
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,060
because I wasted so much time the last couple days. So I just

137
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,620
didn't want to find somebody else.

138
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:51,980
It's a heartbreaker, bud. It's a heartbreaker. So all right. I'm

139
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:56,300
curious in the chat, who the heck has had something similar

140
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,220
to that to this happen to them? By the way, Gina Benson,

141
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:02,620
welcome to call. Good to see on I saw a few more people popping

142
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:05,700
in. Who has had something similar to this happened to

143
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:11,060
them in the in their entire career? Maybe they've only been

144
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,700
in the game a little bit and have had to happen. I've had

145
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:17,300
this happen, by the way, but this is far from uncommon. And

146
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:20,020
we're going to talk about this today. And yeah, that deal is

147
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:22,460
toast, but you go ahead and write that puppy off and go get

148
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,740
another one. It's heartbreaking because you don't want to have

149
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,300
to get another one, but you're gonna have to get another one.

150
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,660
And you just chalk it up to a lesson learned. You know what

151
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:32,580
I'm saying? But we are going to break this down today. But I am

152
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:37,180
curious in the chat. Has anyone had a similar experience? You

153
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:39,260
thought you had it? Oh, here we go. Get comments. I didn't even

154
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:43,900
see. Aaron Vogler says yes, yes, yes. With a triple quadruple

155
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:47,660
pack. Yes, he has. We got Jared Ochs has had a similar thing

156
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:50,940
happen twice in the last two weeks. Damn. But Porter, for

157
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,900
real, send me that guy's name. Kick him out of the group, block

158
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,780
him. And I'm going to see if I can get his account completely

159
00:08:55,780 --> 00:09:01,780
span, removed from Facebook. Just kidding. Brandon Shulman.

160
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:06,900
Absolutely. Okay, so guys, this is a common thing. Porter, you

161
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,420
know, since you're my brother, I'm not gonna say you shouldn't

162
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,660
feel bad because you should, bro. You could have had the

163
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:16,740
frickin deal, dude. You know, but what it is. So let me start

164
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,780
off by saying this. This happens in any kind of sale

165
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,900
possible. The first time this ever happened to me, I'm not

166
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,900
going to go on story time forever. But you do need to

167
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,220
understand the very first time this ever happened to me in my

168
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:29,340
entire life. I was in Kearney, Nebraska. Yes, just like you say

169
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:33,500
Kearney is like when there's the fair, but it's spelled K E A R

170
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,020
N E Y could be an interesting city. Go check it out. It's

171
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:40,700
it might fit the the pop the the search volume on some of the

172
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:46,140
niches. Anyway, I mean, Kearney, Nebraska spring break 2013.

173
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:49,820
Instead of being in Miami trick and chasing women and doing all

174
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,580
that, I had a baby back home wife back home, and I was

175
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:56,580
knocking doors in the cold. So try that went on for size, but

176
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:00,100
I'm out in Kearney, Nebraska. And it's a Saturday, and I'm

177
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,660
trying to do my best. I'm trying to make money. It's I'm

178
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:07,100
frickin drove all the way there. And I, you know, I had a bunch

179
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:11,380
of deals teed up from Friday to Saturday, come back, come back,

180
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,620
come back, I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm too

181
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:16,260
young, too stupid to understand that people are full of crap and

182
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,820
they're liars, even though they're humans and they're

183
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,700
adult. So I'm waking up Saturday morning, stoked,

184
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,980
excited, listening to music, thinking I'm gonna have three

185
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,940
deals in the bag by lunch, and I'm going to sail into the

186
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:28,740
sunset on my way back home. And within about an hour, I realized

187
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,100
I'm gonna have to put on my frickin big boy panties and go

188
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:34,620
get a deal because all of those deals fell through. First one,

189
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:39,060
note on the door. Second one, no answer. Third one, don't know

190
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,540
where they're at. All the lights are closed, blinds are closed,

191
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,900
kids peeking through the frickin blinds like don't answer the

192
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:49,100
door. All of them done. So I'm knocking. I'm scrapping. And

193
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,940
guys, in my mind, I was like, if I have to drive, I don't even

194
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:54,540
know, it's like 12 hours from Kearney, Nebraska to St. George,

195
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:58,460
Utah, correction, Cedar City, Utah at the time, I am going to

196
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:04,900
die of, of, of just mental head heads, just jacked up because

197
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,060
I'm going to I'm going to have to go and think about how I

198
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:09,820
didn't get a deal on my last day. And I had the whole

199
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:13,100
Saturday. So I'm literally scrapping to the point where at

200
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:17,940
lunch, I told them not even to pick me up. I'm like, I have to

201
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:21,060
get a deal. So my manager came, he brought me like a Gatorade and

202
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:25,060
like a disgusting protein bar that I didn't eat. And I sat in

203
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,820
the car for five minutes and went knock. So I knock on the

204
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:30,380
store, guys from South Africa, I do my pitch, I get in the house,

205
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:34,380
I do the walkthrough. But I started skipping a few steps.

206
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:37,300
Like I remember, I didn't let him sit down at the table, like

207
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,220
all these little things kind of like Porter's talking about

208
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:42,300
where, you know, he didn't do the zoom call. Have I closed

209
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,380
deals before not been on a zoom call? Yes. Does it increase my

210
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:47,940
chances? Yes. But I kind of got a little bit lazy, because I

211
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:52,060
was so like, I was like Porter, like I had gotten deals almost

212
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:57,780
every day that week. And I was just so not desperate, but I was

213
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:00,860
so anxious to get a deal on Saturday, just like Porter so

214
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:03,620
anxious to finally cross that 10k mark. It's almost like you

215
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:06,940
have like this bad juju over your head. And I didn't I just

216
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:09,540
skipped a few steps and I didn't even let him sit down and I was

217
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:14,220
kind of rushing. Anyway, I pitched the deal. And he's super

218
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,380
interested in the thermostats because you can control them

219
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,700
from the phone. This is before Nest and everything. This is

220
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:22,300
very, very like high tech to everybody. And the guy's like,

221
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:26,380
he says to me, he's like, Well, hold on, like we get done. He

222
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:29,340
says yes, he gives me his information, like the deal is

223
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:33,340
done. And I'm filling out the card, just to call in and get

224
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:36,260
this thing set up. And he says to me, he goes, Hey, real quick,

225
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:40,260
just as a just a heads up. I have, you know, three

226
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:44,660
thermostats, not two. Will this work? Okay, or he says something

227
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,820
like that, or I've got this other kind of a system. Will

228
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:51,460
this work? And I hesitated just a tiny bit, because I didn't

229
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,580
want to lie to the guy, but I never heard this question. I was

230
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:57,300
like, Yeah, it should. There should be no issues. I like,

231
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,900
yeah, I don't think there's any problem. I said, let me just call

232
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,900
my manager really quick. And I'm gonna let me just double

233
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,620
checks. I really didn't want to like, lie to him or whatever.

234
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:10,620
Anyway, I think I just text my manager and I was like, Hey, can

235
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,380
you do this? And he was also trying to get deals and he

236
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:15,060
didn't respond. And I was like, Hey, he hasn't responded. But I'm

237
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,820
telling you, if this doesn't work, then we can just lower

238
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:22,180
your price, whatever. But I'm 90% sure that's gonna work. Well,

239
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:26,260
90% was not good enough for him. 90% was enough for him to feel

240
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:30,620
a little bit hesitant, a little bit queasy about the deal. And

241
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:36,140
from there, I just lost him. And he's like, Well, you know, I

242
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:38,140
had this meeting, I'm going to go check the meeting out, you

243
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:41,100
get the answer, come back, meet me, and then we'll do the deal.

244
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,860
But I really want to get that 100% answer. I don't want to

245
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:47,300
maybe I don't want to whatever. And the so long story short, I

246
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:51,500
lost the deal. The other crappy part is I found out that yes,

247
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:55,780
indeed, that I didn't lie, it did do that thing that I that he

248
00:13:55,820 --> 00:14:00,300
did do three thermostats, whatever. And the lesson that I

249
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:04,180
learned, and it sucked, because I actually left the house, you

250
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,140
know, went and tried to get another deal. And I came back

251
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:08,660
thinking, Oh, thank goodness, this guy's gonna be home, and

252
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:11,900
I'm gonna be able to get this deal. And I got back and met

253
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:14,060
him there telling me, you know what, I thought about it more.

254
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:16,420
And this isn't something that I need right now, blah, blah,

255
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:20,540
blah, blah, blah. So basically, the same exact story that you

256
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:23,380
have, but in alarms, and I've had this happen so many times

257
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,860
to me, we're doing rank and rent that I'm sick and tired of

258
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,660
even thinking about it. So this is something that happens. But

259
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:32,060
yeah, let's let's break this thing down, guys. Where do you

260
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,540
guys think Porter went wrong? Porter, where do you think you

261
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,940
went wrong? You think you went wrong, not getting on the zoom?

262
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:40,060
Or where do you think that we lost this deal? Because I'm

263
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:42,980
telling you right now, I don't think the guy was confused about

264
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:47,060
375 per week. I think that was just an excuse. I think he

265
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:49,940
definitely knew what it was. I think that he came back and that

266
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:52,540
was just him trying to save face based on what you're telling me.

267
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:55,380
But what do you think you wrote? You went wrong, bud.

268
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:59,580
I think definitely the zoom call I this is this is what pissed

269
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:02,180
me off too, though, as he closed one of the deals. So I was like,

270
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:05,020
bro, and that's why I told him, I said, did you close one of

271
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:07,700
these jobs? I sent you like, you're telling me like, I don't

272
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,700
see you three. So I didn't think that was a problem. I feel like

273
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,300
I said enough to be the sender screencast. The only thing that

274
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:16,580
I didn't do was get I get them on the zoom call. And I

275
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,980
obviously I didn't make sure that the deal went through on

276
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,780
the call. You know what I'm saying? Like, I didn't feel like

277
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:24,060
I actually like got a yes or no. And I should have just said,

278
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:27,060
hey, if it's a yes, it's either yes or no, it may be is a no.

279
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:30,220
And I shouldn't have let him freaking get off. I should have

280
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,500
just, you know.

281
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,940
So let me ask you a question. Let's dissect this a little

282
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,500
bit. You said in three leads over the course of how many how

283
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,180
many days weeks? How many leads? Yeah,

284
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,540
it was like one. It was like a week.

285
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:46,780
Okay, so every week three leads. Did he close? Which one of the

286
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,700
three leads he closed number one, two or three?

287
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,940
Number three, the third one,

288
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,460
the third one. And that's when you decided to go for that's

289
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,460
that's textbook. Good job, by the way, because you don't need

290
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,780
to send him five if he closed number three. So you did all

291
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:03,540
that correctly. You sent him the screencast did. Yeah, the only

292
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:06,780
thing guys, remember that when you lose a deal when you lose a

293
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:11,540
sale, most of the time, it's the step previous. So you think, oh,

294
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:14,420
you know, I didn't do a good job in the presentation. And that's

295
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:18,500
why I lost the deal. But really, it's typically something if you

296
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,780
lost the deal there, it's probably something in the

297
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:24,260
previous step, which is the setup. And I mean, I think

298
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:26,060
there's two things that could have happened. I think number

299
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:31,060
one is, you know, guys, I ran calls trying to close deals on

300
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:35,500
the phone for four years. I isn't it's crazy. Porter, did

301
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:39,460
you know that I didn't start doing zoom closes until 2020?

302
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:43,420
I did not. It's so hard. I was getting so frustrated.

303
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:48,140
Now there. Let me say this. I when I say I didn't I didn't

304
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:52,820
do them like consistently once in a while I would but it was a

305
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,980
little bit more comfortable for me because I felt a little bit

306
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:58,300
like nervous having to sit in front of a screen and talk to a

307
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,940
human even though it was a computer screen. So I was the

308
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:03,740
one that was opting usually for the phone call I'd get my card

309
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:06,460
is kind of like a de stress or I could talk and whatever. But

310
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:10,180
guys, I for the first first four years of my rank and rank

311
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:13,740
career, I did not use zoom. And then the only reason I started

312
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,700
using zoom is because it was COVID and everyone is talking

313
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,700
about zoom. And there was like all these memes on zoom and

314
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:21,780
people doing weird stuff during classes and calls and stuff. And

315
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:24,740
I was like, and everyone was like zoom, zoom, zoom. So I was

316
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,780
like, Okay, I'm gonna start using it. And then I just shot

317
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:29,380
through the roof. And I was like, I'm an idiot. Because it's

318
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:32,540
just like being in person to the point that even if I was closing

319
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:35,340
somebody in Dubai, and they want to go to dinner, I would choose

320
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:37,660
to do is I go to dinner, I choose to do to do a zoom call

321
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:40,020
to close the deal because I can show them things. People are

322
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:43,220
serious when they're at their desk at their computer. But

323
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:46,060
that's number one, guys, always, always, always, always, always

324
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:50,660
get on a zoom call. Now, I'm at the same time, because this is

325
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:55,340
an art not a science. You know, sometimes you you try so hard to

326
00:17:55,340 --> 00:18:00,300
get on a zoom call that you miss the deal, you miss the energy

327
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:05,100
and whatever. And so I will say there are times when conditions

328
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:09,100
can't be perfect. But dude, I would rather even someone be on

329
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:12,020
a zoom call in a gas station parking lot on their phone,

330
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:14,420
than be on a phone call, because you ended up running a phone

331
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:19,820
call, correct? Yeah. Yeah. So that I would say that's number

332
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,860
one. And then the second thing, and it's something I want to

333
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,300
talk about really quick, too. And by the way, Brandon said,

334
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,860
well, let's look at our comments here. Aaron said, Yeah, hopping

335
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:29,180
on a zoom, probably would have built more trust seems like that

336
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:32,020
was the issue. I agree with you, Aaron. And that is one of the

337
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:35,700
things, I would say the hardest thing here, sending the leads

338
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:38,060
does help build trust. But when people can see you, they can see

339
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:40,340
this is a real person. And if they have my credit card,

340
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:43,620
they're actually not going to like scam me. That helps a lot. I

341
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,620
agree. And then Brandon says, what if you would have

342
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:49,500
compromised said, let's do it for 349 per week for a month or

343
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,740
two, and then it will go to 375. So Brandon, just a little

344
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:57,660
clarification. The guy's claiming that he thought it was

345
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:02,940
$349 per month, instead of per week. So it's not a discrepancy

346
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:08,460
of 15 or $25. It does discrepancy of 1200 $1,100 of

347
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:11,220
difference per month. So the guy's basically, in my mind,

348
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:15,460
full of crap. And saying that he thought it was something else

349
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,500
when I think that's bullcrap. What do you think, Porter?

350
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:20,700
No, now, after I'm done with this, everything that I'm

351
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,420
thinking about, I'm like, that's so dumb. Like, I showed you the

352
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:25,780
screencast, like everything that I was pointing at, like, I

353
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:28,660
didn't drop the price. But during the call, I clearly said,

354
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:32,460
Hey, $1,500 per month, like, I was not hesitant about that. I'm

355
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:35,300
like, you, you're, you're, you're full of crap.

356
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,940
Yeah, you can't I mean, it's it did he ever sign the contract?

357
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:44,300
No. Okay. So yeah, he definitely knew. Here's the other thing

358
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,220
guys. And this is another really, really important thing

359
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,700
is I have a live Aaron, if you're still on this call, I

360
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,740
would love for you to pull this up. And maybe we can reference

361
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:55,060
it in the comments. But there's a live we have it's called drill

362
00:19:55,060 --> 00:20:00,020
the hole. And there it is so important that you guys getting

363
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:03,060
a credit card. unbelievably important. You did a great job

364
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,660
because a lot of people say, Hey, call me and I'll give you

365
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:08,220
my credit card digits. And that's great. But running the

366
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:14,500
credit card is the key. Okay. And so I have this live, I don't

367
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:17,180
want to like spoil it. But basically, there was something I

368
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,980
used to do in door to door sales, a lot of the stuff that

369
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:21,980
I that I learned, that's like the fundamental stuff about

370
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:24,820
sales, I learned from door to door sales, but it's exactly

371
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:27,980
the same here. And what I would find guys is that when I got a

372
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:30,380
deal, I'd close somebody on getting an alarm that was going

373
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,980
to be in their house for the next however many years, five

374
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:35,980
year contract, I would get the credit, I'd get the credit card,

375
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:39,140
I'd get the check, I would get the contract signed everything

376
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:43,340
right, just like Porter did. But sometimes like we would always

377
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:46,940
try to schedule by the way, we would always try to schedule to

378
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:49,420
get these things scheduled right away. So if I close you today,

379
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:52,580
like right now, I would have it scheduled tonight, because I

380
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:55,020
knew that if I didn't, there was a good chance that you were

381
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,380
going to cancel. Okay, that's just what happened because you

382
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:00,620
start thinking about it. And it was emotional sale. Oh, man, five

383
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:04,660
50 bucks a month or whatever that's $600 a year, or more, we

384
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:08,220
could do something else that but then what I started realizing

385
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:12,340
is that if I could just get some of the equipment in the house,

386
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:16,220
even one piece of equipment and charge their card charge their

387
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:20,460
bank account for that initial deposit, even if it was $100, I

388
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:24,900
almost never lost any deals, I swear to you, and my technicians

389
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,820
would get really pissed off because they wanted to get to

390
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,060
the house, install the whole thing and not have to come back.

391
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:31,500
So I'd have to text the technicians and be like, yo, this

392
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,020
lady is not going to be cool with you staying in her house

393
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:37,340
till midnight. She's a single lady. And you look pretty scary

394
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:40,940
and you haven't showered in like a year. But I'm going to pay

395
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:44,980
you whatever 100 bucks or not probably 20 bucks that time

396
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:48,380
said it wasn't making 100 bucks to throw around. I'll pay you

397
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:51,780
20 bucks, come in, drill a hole in the wall, slap up the panel

398
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:55,500
and come back tomorrow, I'll pay you extra for your time spent.

399
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:59,460
And just because guys, it was crazy the amount because then

400
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,060
guess what it was real to them. They could see it on the wall.

401
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,740
And most importantly, we had charged the card and the damage

402
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,180
was done. There was no going back even though it was possible

403
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:10,620
to get their money back. It was so much harder. So what I highly,

404
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,460
highly, highly, highly recommend by the way, Aaron just

405
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:15,220
referenced it, that is a phenomenal live and it is very

406
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:20,740
true. And we do this the same with anything that we sell, we

407
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:25,500
sell is get a payment, send the guy an invoice, say, Hey,

408
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,340
Porter, what I would have done, hey, I'm gonna send you an

409
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:29,260
invoice, you can put the money on later, but I got to get at

410
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:33,180
least like $100 down payment, non refundable. And I'm going to

411
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:35,580
send it to you real quick. And then I'll charge the rest of it,

412
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:38,700
you know, let's say in 24 hours, but I'm going to charge 100

413
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,220
bucks. So hang on one second. I promise you if you would have

414
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:44,060
charged even 100 bucks, there would have been an 80. I'm just

415
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:47,340
throwing numbers out here. But maybe, you know, 80% chance he

416
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,380
would not have went sideways on you.

417
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,220
No, it pisses me off so bad because I was like this thoughts

418
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:54,980
and you said yes.

419
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:58,940
Yeah, and that's the frustrating part. And I you know,

420
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:01,220
Francesca's lost deals like this, Kyle's lost deals like

421
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:03,900
this, I've lost deals like this. And I'm hoping that people on

422
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,020
this call are not going to lose deals like this guys, if you get

423
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:12,300
the deal, make sure you frickin run the deal on the call. Okay,

424
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,900
and good. Look, I understand the situations people are lying.

425
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,140
We've had the craziest stuff happen. We've had people giving

426
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:19,460
the credit card, and they're reading all the digits and they

427
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:23,060
get to the last four and they cut the zoom and they pretend

428
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:24,980
that their phone died and you never hear from them again.

429
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:32,140
We had a guy just barely this is so amazing. We had a guy in

430
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:36,340
the last couple weeks, about a month ago, get done, we figure

431
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:38,780
it out, put a deal together. He's pumped. This guy has been

432
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:43,420
hitting me up for years about doing this. And anyway, long

433
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:47,980
story short, he gets the credit card information to us. And he

434
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:51,260
tells Kyle, he's like, Yeah, I'm sorry, he doesn't give the

435
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:55,380
credit card information. He's a yes, he's I'm good. He's a

436
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:58,340
whatever. And then you know what he says? He says, I lost my

437
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:03,220
wallet. Let me I'm gonna have to find it. And then I'll let you

438
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,620
know. It's like, bro, no one lost their wallet. And I don't

439
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:08,180
know about you. But I have like 15 cards saved on my computer.

440
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,700
And I know my card. And I've got a picture of my card, and all

441
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:15,340
this different stuff. And dude, Kyle, Kyle, Kyle took the bait,

442
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:19,500
dude. Kyle took the bait called me got the deal. We got the

443
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,460
deal. Didn't run the deal. I was like, yeah, things done, dude.

444
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:25,580
Guess what, dude still hasn't done it.

445
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:27,620
In two weeks.

446
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:31,180
Oh, it's been like a month. And then we finally got a text back.

447
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:33,900
We started giving him a hard time. We're like, Hey, bro, are

448
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:39,300
you like, you know, not sure that you can make this work? Or

449
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:41,660
are you? Do we need to talk to your wife? Like, it's somebody

450
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:44,300
that's like pretty chill. We're giving him a hard time. And that

451
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:48,220
was like, finally, like, oh, sorry, been busy. We had a baby

452
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,340
and I can't make any decisions to after the baby. And it's

453
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:53,380
like, bro, you already said yes, you said you lost your wallet.

454
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:58,380
So point is, guys, I don't care if these by the way, Richard

455
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:01,060
Marches, welcome to the call, my friend, it doesn't matter how

456
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:03,980
old people are doesn't matter if they're men, women, doctors,

457
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:07,100
lawyers, frickin, whatever people are full of schnazzle.

458
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,300
And they will lie straight through their teeth while

459
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:13,380
looking you in the eyes and eating frickin, whatever. That's

460
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:17,340
just how people are. Do not leave the call. First of all,

461
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:21,420
always get on a zoom call every single time. Let's talk about

462
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:24,420
that really good Porter. I couldn't get on the zoom call you

463
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:26,660
said because he had an Android. Is that a thing? Because he

464
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:27,180
should know.

465
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,620
I think I was that was complete bull crap. I think he didn't want

466
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:34,180
to get on the zoom call because he was he was out on a job. I

467
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:36,620
told him I said, Hey, I need a computer. That was his first

468
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:39,620
thing I told him I said be on a computer. He was that was this

469
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:43,020
one thing. And then zoom I called him I was like, we're like,

470
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:45,140
are you home? He's like, no, I'm out on a job. I'm like, okay,

471
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:49,300
well, that sucks. Like, so now he's in his truck. And then the

472
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,940
zoom call, which I think you can join zoom, just join in your

473
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:54,460
browser. So I'm like, I don't think he just wanted to get on

474
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:56,540
zoom. He was just making that excuse.

475
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:01,140
100%. So here's the thing, guys, is if I'm doing a call, and I've

476
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:04,900
tried to get this deal, and the guy closed a job, and I'm like,

477
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:08,500
hey, look, this guy's hot, let me get on it, whatever. And I, I

478
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:12,380
could see and I could I could justify like, all right, you

479
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:16,340
know, perfect scenario, he's at a computer, and he's on zoom. I

480
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:20,900
could justify though, getting on a zoom on your phone on the job

481
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:23,060
site, I'd say, hey, can you go in your truck? Let's talk like

482
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:26,460
that's still not ideal. But it's it's it works. And I've closed

483
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:30,300
deals like that. But I would rather wait, I would I would

484
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:34,020
literally tell the guy maybe on the spot, something like, hey, I

485
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:36,300
you know, no disrespect here. I've sent you three leads, you

486
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,740
already made money. You said you'd be on a zoom call, I need

487
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:43,180
you to be on a zoom so I can show this to you. Can I like, if

488
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:45,660
it's not that I need you to be by computer in the next couple

489
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:51,380
hours, I probably would never get on a call call on without

490
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:54,940
being in zoom, unless maybe I had tried two, three times. And

491
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:58,100
I was like, at this point, I'm just losing that momentum, that

492
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:01,260
steam that energy that whatever, that's when I might justify

493
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:06,260
that. But I would say it's, it's, you could justify getting

494
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:09,380
on a zoom on the phone, but definitely make sure you get on

495
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:12,540
a zoom, even if it's a gas station parking lot on a on a

496
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:15,900
job site zoom for sure, because it's just hard. Like if, you

497
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,860
know, people, it's, again, when we go back to door to door

498
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:22,100
sales, guys, there's these little things that the more of

499
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:25,220
it's, it's like the training, right? Sales is like baking a

500
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:27,940
cake, we have the perfect recipe, we're telling you exactly

501
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:30,660
when to put in the flour, when to bake, when to, you know, stir

502
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:33,300
the eggs, when to add this, how much butter, what brand of

503
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:36,660
butter, whatever. And, you know, you guys can, you know,

504
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:39,300
you have to do it perfectly. And you might still have a cake

505
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:43,180
that's that works, right? But the less of the of the

506
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:46,940
recommendations, the more you deviate from the exact recipe,

507
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:51,060
the more variables there are, and the more chance you have of

508
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:54,340
losing the deal of the cake coming out tasting like garbage,

509
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:58,420
right? So you do what you can, you know, once in a while, you're

510
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,540
like, all right, ideally, you're supposed to use this kind of

511
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:03,900
butter. But today, we only have this kind of butter. It's not

512
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,980
perfect. But you know what, we need the cake because it's

513
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:08,620
somebody's birthday, I'm going to slam it in. That's a good

514
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:12,140
that's something that you could look past. Something like not

515
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:15,900
getting on a zoom call. That's like, you know, using baking

516
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:20,460
powder instead of flour. Like that's tough, right? And yes,

517
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:23,580
maybe once in a while, you're going to squeak out a deal. But

518
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,180
I'm telling you guys right now, we're gonna we're talking about

519
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:28,660
this, because it's just for everybody to not lose this, make

520
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:33,300
sure you guys get on a zoom call every single freaking time,

521
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,980
even if it's in a gas station parking lot, even if it's on a

522
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:38,460
job site, and just tell the business owner, especially

523
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:44,100
Porter, you had enough leverage because he you'd you'd send him

524
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,820
three leads and he closed one you had made him money without

525
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:49,500
anything in return. So I think it would have been completely

526
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,300
fine for you to say like, look, dude, you told me to be on a

527
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:54,940
call. I need you to like get to a truck and get on a zoom you

528
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:58,100
sir, you have to push a link. I've done this 100 times. I don't

529
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,740
care if you have an iPad, you just push the link and it's

530
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:03,580
gonna put you on pretty simple. My grandpa does. Yeah, you can

531
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:09,140
joke about it. But get on a zoom. Yeah. Okay, so it's okay,

532
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:14,140
bro. Um, nothing like losing nothing like losing a $18,000 a

533
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:17,140
year, but could have been pretty nice to when you think about

534
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:22,900
it like that. It makes you sick, right? Yeah. Dude, I I've been

535
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:25,860
to the very, very end of deals and been like, I literally did

536
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:29,020
all this work. It's been it's been weeks of work. And I just

537
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:32,420
lost at the very end because I was lazy or because I said this

538
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:36,580
or because I did that. And it's frustrating. Okay. So Trevor

539
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:39,620
time says not being able to get a zoom call from an Android is

540
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:43,140
100% BS. Yes, that is absolutely true. Because guys, all you have

541
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:45,500
to do is click on it. Yes, we know that I enjoy is our

542
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:49,180
inferior. Just kidding to you Android users. To be honest, I

543
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:53,220
just think that Apple's got me by the teeth. But you can just

544
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:56,140
click on a link. And Aaron says, Yeah, someone needs to tell zoom

545
00:29:56,140 --> 00:30:00,060
to get compatible with Android lol. Okay, Corey says, Are there

546
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:03,020
any live recordings of zoom calls with past customers that

547
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:08,340
we can? Yes, there are. Corey Gilbert. Yes, there are. Maybe

548
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:12,180
Aaron, you could tag him in a few. We have a few live calls

549
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:16,060
that I've done. These are some of the OG calls from 2020. You're

550
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:18,540
going to see that my process isn't perfect. I'm still

551
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:22,740
learning. But you definitely can see that I'm a young buck, just

552
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:26,020
trying to make a name for himself back in the the on the

553
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:29,300
interwebs. Gina Benson says, What do you think about recording

554
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,380
a video to send to the business owner before getting on the

555
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:39,900
zoom? Yeah, I do that. I don't know. Maybe Gina's talking

556
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:42,420
about said like having one video that you can send that could be

557
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:47,380
a good idea. That's a really good idea. And I'm guessing

558
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:50,300
part of you said in the zoom that like kind of explained what

559
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:54,620
the expectations were before, right? Yeah, screencast. Sorry.

560
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,100
What do you think about recording a video to send the

561
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,980
business owner before getting on the zoom? Yeah. So yeah, I'm not

562
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:03,700
really sure you're saying Gina, but if you're saying because

563
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:08,940
that is actually a really good idea. I like to do with lead

564
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:13,180
generation deals, I really like to have, I'll take the time to

565
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:19,220
manually create a custom video, a custom screen recording a

566
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:22,460
custom screencast for each one, because then I can say their

567
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:24,900
name again, and again, and again, I can show their website,

568
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:27,740
it's very custom, and it's 10 minutes long, five minutes long.

569
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:31,420
However, with those of you, all of you that are on this call

570
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:34,340
that joined digital landlords, we do the same thing, we have a

571
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:36,500
call that kind of sets expectations. It's funny, we do

572
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:41,140
the exact same process that we teach with you guys, when you

573
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:43,660
join this program, right, we send you a screencast, it's not

574
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:46,420
exactly customized for every single person. But that

575
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:49,820
screencast says, here's the expectations. You know, when you

576
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:52,060
get to the end, don't don't tell us you need to do this, this,

577
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:54,300
this or this, like, we are expecting you to give us a yes

578
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:57,180
or no, if it's a maybe it's a no. And we're going to get on and

579
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:59,140
show you this, this and this. And we're going to ask you to

580
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:02,380
make a decision, like, we do the exact same thing. So that's a

581
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:09,900
good idea. Let's see, Gina says, yeah, like custom for each

582
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:13,540
one. Yeah, that's, that's what I that's what I do. That's exactly

583
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:18,020
what I do. Aaron says, Andy, the you can't sell an Android

584
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:22,140
user truth lives on. It is a little more difficult. I sold

585
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:26,340
Android users, but I know what you're saying, bro. Okay, Aaron

586
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:28,860
says to Corey, he's gonna message a few screencasts Nick

587
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:31,540
has done for real profit. Also, Corey, if you want, like, I'm

588
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:34,980
going to check this out. Like if I, if you go to, if you just go

589
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:39,100
to the Facebook group, I'm going to see what the smart search

590
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:41,060
I'm just I have no idea how I'm even going to find it. I'm going

591
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,940
to go to the Facebook group, I'm going to go to the little

592
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:50,980
search bar and put live recording. Hold on. Maybe live

593
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:54,140
sales call. Okay, there's Yeah, right there. Okay, that's let's

594
00:32:54,140 --> 00:33:00,180
see. Hold on. There we go. I got one right there. Oh, that's a

595
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:02,580
discovery call. Just kidding. But yeah, another thing that you

596
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:05,940
guys can do it, Corey is you can just do some smart searches might

597
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:09,820
take you a second. But if you don't want to wait for anyone,

598
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:13,460
look, there's another one right there. Borhan, one of our

599
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:16,980
students actually posted his deal. There's a bunch of them

600
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:21,180
just type in smart searches, live recording, live call. I'm

601
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:25,500
going to I bet you type if you type in live close, like this

602
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:31,220
live close Nick would inside of the group search bar. There we

603
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:33,820
go. Boom, found one right there. There's a there's a deal that I

604
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:38,260
lost right there on December 7 2022. If you want to see that

605
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:43,420
one, there is let's see, I bet I can find another one quickly.

606
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:47,820
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold tight. See if I can find

607
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:50,020
another one. There's a picture of Kanye in a boat. You guys

608
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:54,060
know what I'm saying? That's great. Let's see. Oh, right

609
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:59,420
there. There's another one. Yeah, anyway, that's just another

610
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:04,740
idea, guys. Video two of to build your list. Just go do a

611
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:06,460
couple smart searches. But Aaron, yeah, that would be cool

612
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:10,260
if you could if you could help him out as well just to kind of

613
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:13,580
speed things up. Okay. I'm just gonna see if there's one more.

614
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,940
Dude, I by the way, guys, for those of you that have been in

615
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:19,580
this group. Oh, here we go. I'm gonna here's a $1,200 a month

616
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:22,460
flat fee close. Corey, I'm gonna tag you in this one right now

617
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:25,780
just to save Aaron some time. But just guys. Yeah, that's one

618
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:28,020
thing to know in this group. That's the beautiful thing about

619
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:31,100
Facebook groups, even though I freaking hate Facebook sometimes

620
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:36,060
is if you just go in and search for certain things like Oh, what

621
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:38,700
would Nick probably have done live clothes live this just

622
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:41,860
type in Nick would and whatever you can find a lot of material

623
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:45,260
this group is almost three years old and it's chock full of

624
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:47,820
material. Okay. So anyway, just tagged you, bro.

625
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:55,620
Your clothes on the guy in St. George the excavation guy right

626
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:57,860
before my first deal. I watched that the night before just to

627
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:58,780
get a good feel.

628
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:01,700
Oh, yeah, dude, it's it you know what I used to do every single

629
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:04,500
day before I hit the doors. I would listen I there was the

630
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:07,500
guys the top guys making the most amount of money. They had

631
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:10,460
their pitches recorded and they were put in like our company

632
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:13,780
training. And I promise you, I would listen like a 20 minute

633
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:16,940
video. I would listen to Oz making my omelet. I would listen

634
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:20,620
to it as I get in the shower. I listen to every freaking day. And

635
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,980
you know, it was amazing. I would get on the doors, I would

636
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:25,020
get at a closing table, somebody would say something and I would

637
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:28,420
just say this one liner. And it was like exactly like, you know,

638
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:30,940
this there's this guy named Jordan Williams, it was like one

639
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:35,460
of the OGs and he had like 400 accounts made how many $100,000

640
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:39,220
as like a college kid selling selling alarm systems. And I

641
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:42,260
would say the exact same lines the exact same ways that he

642
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:45,220
would. And it was like, okay, I'm like programming my

643
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:49,260
subconscious. So guys, I'm not saying I'm the only person knows

644
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:54,100
how to close deals. But I scaled quickly we went we were closing

645
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:58,820
every freaking deal we were on fire. And if you guys want to go

646
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:02,140
to my 2020 calls, we have probably four or five that you

647
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:05,220
can listen to. Definitely guys listen to those go to the gym

648
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:10,100
before your freaking your zoom call. And and listen to that. I

649
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:12,060
know it's maybe you don't want to maybe you can get on the

650
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:14,740
treadmill, whatever and just you're going to start hearing and

651
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:18,420
saying things that I say how I explain the monopoly thing how

652
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:20,940
I explain this how I explain that the confidence that I have

653
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:25,060
when I go for the close and help Corey, Corey Gilbert knows

654
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:27,540
exactly who Jordan Williams is. That's hilarious. Because he

655
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:33,220
also did door to door. Okay, let's see. Shane Coogan can also

656
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:36,180
have the screencast. Yes. So they're not screencast. These

657
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:38,740
are actually recordings. Corey, since you're on this call, so I

658
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:41,620
just tagged you if you could hook Shane up real quick and tag

659
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:45,620
Shane on that video as well. That might push it to the top.

660
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:48,900
But guys, these are these are not record. These are just

661
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:51,220
recordings. They're not screencasts of me doing live

662
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:54,300
closes. Okay. Gina says you're gonna check it out. Oh, there we

663
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:57,900
go. Aaron just barely had went ahead and posted for us. So

664
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:01,100
guys, in the next 12 minutes, let's let's see what what

665
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:05,300
questions you guys have. What? This could be about sales, this

666
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:08,260
could be about losing deals, closing deals, get a 10k. Any

667
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:10,420
question you have drop in the chat and that what I'm going to

668
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:15,700
ask you Porter is what have you learned on this journey of

669
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:21,140
scrapping your way to $10,000 because it has been a scrap

670
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:25,380
Porter, he went he got to do I think you got to like 85 one

671
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:29,700
time. Yeah. And then you got busy with farming, which is

672
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:32,060
natural, you dump some of your business owners weren't super

673
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:36,580
solid, you lost a couple deals. There was that like you almost

674
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:39,860
touched it then I think you're at nine and then you dropped and

675
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:43,740
then you you like turn it back on you're at 9400 and you almost

676
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:46,580
just had 10,000 you're gonna get 10,000 obviously but like

677
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:50,700
now you're like give us what have you learned just trying to

678
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:53,300
hit that 10,000 it's almost like you got this like dark cloud of

679
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:55,620
doom hanging over your head you're like oh my gosh, I'm not

680
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:58,020
sure if I can hit it you obviously can but it's sometimes

681
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:00,660
it's like when you want something so bad. It's like so

682
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,820
hard to hit but yeah, tell us about that.

683
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:07,340
I honestly even with the last couple deals that I've gotten I

684
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:10,140
tried to have a different mindset of getting these deals

685
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:14,500
like instead of like like that 10k is such a big number which I

686
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:17,260
know I mean it's a lot of money but like in the grand scheme of

687
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:20,460
things it's not but like to me I've always made it this huge

688
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:23,820
deal and I feel like it's like psyching me out a little bit you

689
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:26,380
know I'm saying like I'm this close but then like I make the

690
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:30,260
zoom call too much pressure like I'm forcing it too much and

691
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:33,220
like the last couple deals I was like hey if I get to 10k and

692
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:35,580
because the goal was hey I want to get to 10k and it wasn't even

693
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:38,040
to get to 10k before I was on farming but like it kind of

694
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:41,000
worked out that way because I was landing a couple deals and

695
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,080
then I was like dude I gotta hit this like I want to hit it this

696
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,480
month like I was setting goals and we were like trying to get

697
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:49,560
these things happening and I think I had sales breath I really

698
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,880
do think at the end of the day I should have just been like hey

699
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:55,760
the goal is 25,000 and when I hit that 20 that hit that 10k

700
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,880
great but like I got to kind of you know I felt like that I was

701
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:03,160
almost like my end point in my head mentally you know I'm

702
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:07,520
saying like I just over over hyped it in a way that I kind of

703
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,800
just psyched myself out maybe I was just a little bit too

704
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:14,400
salesy on the call you know like I was forcing it you know but I

705
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,040
definitely feel like the deals are never perfect every one of

706
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,760
my deals I always expect them to be perfect but every one of

707
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,760
them are are wrong in some way but I end up getting them so

708
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:26,400
like that's the crazy thing like I'm literally doing prospecting

709
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,800
calls on the tractor I'm like standing over leads with

710
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,280
servando in the background chopping his gum you know I'm

711
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:35,000
saying like there's there's certain certain things that are

712
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,840
happening but like just you're able to get the deal nothing

713
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:43,000
needs to be perfect to do it yeah that's a good point I hope

714
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,320
everyone knows that well by the way you're going to get it you

715
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,480
just kind of relax you got to I think what you need to do is set

716
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:50,480
your targets be like dude I got to get to 25k because I'm

717
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,600
playing small ball and then 10k is just something you got to

718
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,120
pass to get to 20k I think you're making 10k too big of a

719
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:59,720
deal 10k is not any money dude you you can't do dog diddly

720
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:03,680
whack on 10k a month and I mean that disrespectfully I just mean

721
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,760
that like if you have that mentality it's like yeah 10k is

722
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:10,160
just on my way to 50k 10k is on my way to 100k it's just a

723
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,760
little blip in the grand scheme of things honestly the best

724
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,360
money you're ever going to make guys for those of you that

725
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:17,160
haven't is your very first dollar doing this because that's

726
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,920
going to hit I promise you the hundred dollars I made on the

727
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:26,560
golf course back in 2018 2017 whatever it was I'm sorry I made

728
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:29,760
I got my my towing deal back in 2016 because I kind of have two

729
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,040
different in my mind I kind of started twice I started in 2016

730
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:37,680
I took a break I came back into it but my towing deal for 600

731
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:40,280
bucks a month and my hundred dollars that I made when I got

732
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:45,800
back into the game those two payments were sweeter I promise

733
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:49,120
you this isn't sounds to sound cooler to sound whatever those

734
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:52,360
are worse sweeter deals those meant more to me those felt more

735
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:55,240
euphoric than when I made a million dollars and I made one

736
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:58,120
point five when I made a hundred thousand dollars in a day like

737
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:02,640
I've done some really cool stuff financially not crazy crazy

738
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,960
but like some cool stuff that I thought was really cool that

739
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,920
hundred dollars when I was on the golf course meant everything

740
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:13,160
to me but you just have to like set yeah dude 2010,000 nothing

741
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,760
we're gonna get to 50 we're gonna get to 100 but I do

742
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,480
understand what you're saying is sometimes you do have sales

743
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,560
breath so yeah just relax realize you're going to 25

744
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:25,400
anyway this is just a blip in the radar so what was the other

745
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:31,760
thing I was gonna say on that note oh I was gonna say this I

746
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:36,800
like what I love I like love whatever is guys Porter's been

747
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:41,160
able to do this while doing something entirely different so

748
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:45,680
his entire summer okay let's let's talk about this early

749
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:49,720
summer like March April right when we got back from Africa you

750
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:54,080
got right back into working with dads that was let's say March

751
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:59,600
April May June July August September October October so the

752
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:03,960
last eight months okay you've been full time farming okay what

753
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:07,760
were you at when you got back from Africa in in March how

754
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,120
much were you making per month because I know you had some

755
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:12,800
deals and you lost some deals were you like six no I think I

756
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:18,680
was at 45 45 or something well no it might have been 64 think

757
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:23,800
it was 64 okay point being is that Porter has been able to

758
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:28,080
maintain his deals by the way he got to six last year while

759
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:31,160
doing farming but my point is that he's been able to not only

760
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:34,880
keep his clients but add another $3,000 per month while he's been

761
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:39,960
working for you know with my dad to learn the ropes of the farm

762
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:43,960
and this is like very strenuous work sometimes 12 hours a day

763
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:46,800
sometimes 12 hours a day take a nap go back and work throughout

764
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,160
the night to try and get the hay baled and make sure it doesn't

765
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:53,600
get rained on sometimes work in 20 hours out of 24 hours and he's

766
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:56,400
still been able to do it and and sometimes he's taking calls

767
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,800
while he's on the tractor and some of you guys I promise you

768
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,760
would be like oh my gosh it's loud and the business owner it's

769
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,880
not going to be professional and I'm going to wait until I'm off

770
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,080
the tractor or he's got you know we have this guy that works for

771
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:11,440
my dad that he swear he chews gum louder than anyone on this

772
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:15,120
planet and you definitely would think you'd lose the deal if you

773
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:18,200
were doing that next to him and he's just doing it and the point

774
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,360
I'm trying to make guys is that some of you guys are so worried

775
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:23,160
about everything being perfect that you are not taking any

776
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:26,560
action and I'm telling you I would rather you like Porter have

777
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:30,040
you ever had a situation where somebody's like yeah I'm not

778
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:35,840
going to do it because you don't sound professional no nobody

779
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:39,240
cares dude a lead to lead is a lead I don't care what you're

780
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,680
doing in the background like yeah okay ideally it's quiet

781
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,840
whatever but at least like you being on the farm it's being

782
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:47,720
real it's being raw so anyway just want to point that out guys

783
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:50,960
for those of you that have excuses like I don't have time

784
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:55,880
I'm busy I got kids also on top of that Porter's wife's been

785
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:58,640
pregnant the entire time so she's been he's been you know

786
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:02,480
helping her with that and then also they just had a child was

787
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:07,360
it like three weeks ago yeah yeah three weeks ago Porter had a

788
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:12,000
child so I just want to point this guy out guys he's been

789
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
able to get to 10k over the last two years while doing

790
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,600
something full time that he's going to do for the rest of his

791
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:19,600
life while his wife's been pregnant they had a baby we've

792
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:22,240
also moved to Africa he was there for a month like we've

793
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:25,520
done all this stuff there is time you can do it it's just

794
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:30,000
about prioritizing so yeah that's it Porter when are we

795
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,680
going to hit 10k dude what are we doing here we're going to

796
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,840
keep that same that same location and we're going to go

797
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:38,000
get another business owner what's the plan well the goal is

798
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,160
I got to get well I'm going to get another city going I'm

799
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:43,600
going to have one in the works my problem is I've been I'm not

800
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:46,880
as prepared so I've had a few weeks where I'm like it's slow

801
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,120
because I don't have one ready to go so I'm going to have one

802
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:51,920
more ready to go I'm going to let this one sit at the lead

803
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,080
because I'm getting leads it's just been a little bit slower

804
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:56,560
so I don't want to bag the area completely because I who

805
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:00,160
literally was the first guy called so I'm going to keep him

806
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:03,920
I'm going to hook a guy today and I like by the end of the

807
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:07,600
week I should either be on as it well what is today what

808
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,760
Tuesday by the end of the week hopefully I at least have a

809
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,400
zoom call scheduled or send them enough leads for the

810
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:16,640
beginning of next week but I'm so close dude I'm so close

811
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,800
you'll get it we're just going to get it and then once he gets

812
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,280
he gets it we'll figure out what he learned by actually

813
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:24,720
getting the deal but yeah um just go ahead and call that one

814
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,440
quits did he say yeah we're done we're not doing it for sure

815
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:31,600
no I said the breakup text I saw that he read it but no reply

816
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:34,640
so I'm just kind of I would just send him a text like best

817
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:39,520
of luck man yeah like you know what I'm saying like uh the dude's

818
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:42,000
not doing it and then sometimes that will like get the deal

819
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,560
back that'll get you that control but anyway lesson learned

820
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,720
you know eighteen thousand dollar lesson learned no big deal

821
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:52,240
just simple anyway guys it happens it's business it's just

822
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:54,880
better than eighteen thousand dollar lesson than a million

823
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,560
dollar lesson that's the way I look at it and again it's crazy

824
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,400
that we're even talking in these kind of numbers that you

825
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,960
can go out and get a fifteen hundred dollar per month deal

826
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:05,280
from a skill set that Porter didn't even know how to do two

827
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,360
years ago while he's driving the tractor while he's having

828
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:09,920
kids while he's freaking doing all this other stuff that's

829
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:13,200
amazing and Kyle Patton thanks for hopping on at the end of the

830
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:17,840
