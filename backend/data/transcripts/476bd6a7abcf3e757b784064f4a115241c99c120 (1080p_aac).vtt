The point of us doing the one-pager is we want to see how the market's going to react.

00:06.600 --> 00:12.680
We want to see, before I go spend money on a domain and all this stuff and actual content,

00:12.680 --> 00:16.280
I want to see what kind of volume I'm going to get for my ads.

00:16.280 --> 00:20.480
I want to see if I can get a business owner on the hook that's going to pay and fund my

00:20.480 --> 00:22.600
property.

00:22.600 --> 00:23.600
That's why I do it.

00:23.600 --> 00:28.940
Now, if you've done really strong due diligence, you're confident in it, no problem.

00:28.940 --> 00:36.220
There is value in getting the domain live, indexed, and starting to rank, no question,

00:36.220 --> 00:41.420
but for me personally, I like to do the one-pager because I will not build, will not build unless

00:41.420 --> 00:43.020
I have somebody that's got a credit card on file.
