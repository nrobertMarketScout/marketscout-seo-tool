WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.960
all right so I just logged in into our own designer Weebly account just because

00:10.960 --> 00:14.840
we want the website to be in our own we're going to create a website for

00:14.840 --> 00:21.440
Queens Creek Arizona concrete now concrete is pretty general make sure

00:21.440 --> 00:25.320
you're talking obviously to your client like some concrete companies they do

00:25.320 --> 00:33.080
driveway patios they do crack repairs they do concrete paving they do stamp

00:33.080 --> 00:38.640
concrete so make sure and this it goes back to your keyword list that you are

00:38.640 --> 00:44.120
targeting only the services that the company does because certain companies

00:44.120 --> 00:47.880
do certain things and not everything so once you're logged in you're probably

00:47.880 --> 00:52.720
not going to have any of these because these are all of our old websites so

00:52.720 --> 01:03.160
you're going to click up here top right create website and okay so here you're

01:03.160 --> 01:08.760
going to pick your theme this is kind of up to you I'm going to pick one of the

01:08.760 --> 01:18.080
ones that we usually use and keep in mind that once you create one frame you

01:18.080 --> 01:22.680
can actually duplicate your website so let's say you have a second concrete

01:22.680 --> 01:26.200
company you can actually just duplicate your first one so you don't have to do

01:26.200 --> 01:30.120
this whole thing from the very start but I am going to show you on how to get it

01:30.120 --> 01:39.200
started for the first time so let's go with this one right here okay and we be

01:39.200 --> 01:44.520
likes to kind of create a website for you but we're going to delete every page

01:44.520 --> 01:48.520
that they made for you except for the home one so you're going to click start

01:48.520 --> 01:58.080
editing right here and it should bring you down here reload editor okay so

01:58.080 --> 02:02.200
you're going to delete that one can stay there for a second you're going to click

02:02.200 --> 02:06.320
on pages up here and I just want to get rid of everything that we've created

02:06.320 --> 02:12.680
for me because we're not going to need it so click on delete confirm let's

02:12.720 --> 02:19.200
delete every page that they made for you because we want to create our own and in

02:19.200 --> 02:25.000
the home one just click on SEO settings make sure there's nothing here okay go

02:25.000 --> 02:30.920
back now we're going to delete everything so every element that was put

02:30.920 --> 02:36.160
in here we want to delete because we're trying to make our own you might just be

02:36.160 --> 02:40.440
able to click here perfect and delete the whole section that way you don't

02:40.520 --> 02:46.440
have to delete every single piece manually so just click delete it should

02:46.440 --> 02:53.240
just eliminate the whole thing okay and then do it again and delete perfect so

02:53.240 --> 03:00.880
pretty fast pretty easy now click on build up here let's add a title up here

03:00.880 --> 03:10.480
in the header section and then we are going to add okay so add so we're going

03:10.480 --> 03:15.280
to click down here on installed apps click on the plus sign where it says add

03:15.280 --> 03:21.680
app and we're going to add some elements are not into designer Weebly already so

03:21.680 --> 03:29.640
in the search bar just type h1 and we're going to add this one right here h1 tag

03:29.640 --> 03:33.680
okay should be free so you don't have to pay for it click on it then click on

03:33.680 --> 03:43.840
add connect and done perfect and now it should show up here okay so we can add

03:43.840 --> 03:51.600
that right here at the bottom okay perfect now we are going to add another

03:51.600 --> 03:59.280
title under our title right here okay so in this top title in the header we're

03:59.280 --> 04:03.280
going to put the company's name obviously we're not going to put the

04:03.280 --> 04:06.600
actual company's name we're just putting the service that we're targeting and

04:06.600 --> 04:13.060
the location so in our case it's going to be and I like to put everything in

04:13.060 --> 04:24.360
capital letters Queens Creek oops concrete okay I don't like going into

04:24.400 --> 04:29.200
separate sentences I like to be in the same line so I'm going to make it

04:29.200 --> 04:33.400
smaller and then we can go back and edit the fonts because they look a little

04:33.400 --> 04:38.040
cartoonish and then we're going to add a phone number right now we don't have a

04:38.040 --> 04:41.800
phone number so you can just put like xxx just so you know that's where you're

04:41.800 --> 04:47.760
going to put the phone number okay all right now we're going to put some text

04:47.760 --> 04:52.960
at the bottom of the h1 I like to put a little spacer there this is up to you on

04:52.960 --> 04:56.280
how you want to structure it you can put a spacer you can put a divider the

04:56.280 --> 05:03.040
divider is just a line so it's right here and then under there right here so

05:03.040 --> 05:08.640
what we like to do is have the h1 right here a text here we like to put a corner

05:08.640 --> 05:14.920
image right here so drag the image until you see this little shape see how the

05:14.920 --> 05:18.600
shape is gone and now the shape is back it looks like a square when you see that

05:18.600 --> 05:24.240
square you just drop it the mouse and once you we put an image right here now

05:24.240 --> 05:28.360
right now it looks a little funky but once you put the image right here you

05:28.360 --> 05:34.680
are going to have the text right next to it and now we're going to put the quote

05:34.680 --> 05:39.640
form the instant quote form right to your right of your text so right here

05:39.640 --> 05:46.680
it's called a contact form on Weebly so we're just going to hold in grab it and

05:46.680 --> 05:54.480
drop it right here perfect this is how we want it to look like and now we're

05:54.480 --> 06:00.640
going to create the quote form and we usually put free a hundred percent

06:00.640 --> 06:06.120
something again we're not making this website to make them look amazing and

06:06.120 --> 06:11.480
fancy we just want them to convert so we wanted them to be simple clear to the

06:11.480 --> 06:17.640
point of what people are getting and how to reach the contractor in the

06:17.640 --> 06:24.480
easiest and fastest way as possible so free a hundred percent instant quote

06:24.480 --> 06:29.560
because we want them to think that they're going to get the quote right away

06:29.560 --> 06:36.760
okay I actually like to put this making myself so I'm going to delete that and

06:37.240 --> 06:46.520
we don't need a comment section so let's just leave the email put a large text

06:46.520 --> 06:57.960
box above the email this is no let's do a short short text box okay perfect and

06:57.960 --> 07:02.000
you're going to click on it right here in the fill title you're going to put

07:02.000 --> 07:13.400
name okay and then we are going to put checkboxes will we arrange the order

07:13.400 --> 07:20.720
just put that and then we're going to put a drop-down box and then do not

07:20.720 --> 07:25.960
forget this we need the phone number because if we don't then our client

07:25.960 --> 07:31.600
cannot call the lead back so make sure the name phone number and the email

07:31.600 --> 07:35.600
right there one important thing this should be automatically done by Weebly

07:35.600 --> 07:40.360
but make sure there is a little asterisk it's red and tiny at the top quarter that

07:40.360 --> 07:44.840
means that the person that is filling out the quote is required to fill out

07:44.840 --> 07:48.480
that information in order to submit the quote if you don't do that then people

07:48.480 --> 07:52.520
can't skip on the number and how you check it is actually right here once you

07:52.520 --> 07:57.640
click on the field it's required is checked out see if I unmark it the

07:57.640 --> 08:02.400
asterisk goes away so make sure that's on because we don't want anyone skipping

08:02.400 --> 08:06.480
on any information because if someone fills this out and we don't have any

08:06.480 --> 08:11.560
more phone number it's a lost lead so and how we like to order this is

08:11.560 --> 08:20.200
actually to put what the client needs at the top and then gathers information at

08:20.200 --> 08:24.200
the bottom because people are more likely to fill it out if they can fill

08:24.200 --> 08:27.600
out their needs first and then tell you who they are instead of the other way

08:27.600 --> 08:39.320
around okay so we're going to change this field to what service do you need

08:39.320 --> 08:43.640
and again you can customize this to whatever your niche is to whatever you

08:43.640 --> 08:50.000
think would be best option items right here you can add as many as you want so

08:50.000 --> 08:55.520
I like to put the services that the client offers so in this case it could

08:55.520 --> 09:07.520
be concrete driveway oops driveway concrete patio these are just some

09:07.520 --> 09:15.840
samples we can put stamped concrete okay and if you click add option you can add

09:15.840 --> 09:21.520
as many as you like if you click on edit you can actually delete them and you can

09:21.520 --> 09:25.920
also move them so you can have stamp concrete at the second and stuff like

09:25.920 --> 09:31.440
that and then you click on done click out of it and you're done with that this

09:31.440 --> 09:40.660
one I like to put when do you need do you need it question mark option items

09:40.660 --> 09:59.500
I'm going to put I am flexible this week and then as soon as possible okay so we

09:59.500 --> 10:04.020
are done making the form and there is something else that we like to add but

10:04.020 --> 10:07.220
make sure you check in with the client and make sure that that's something

10:07.220 --> 10:11.380
that they could possibly offer so first of all we like to center this since

10:11.380 --> 10:16.380
it's the title so center it right there then you're going to add a spacer so

10:16.380 --> 10:24.620
it's not so cramped and then we usually like to add a text right under the free

10:24.620 --> 10:37.220
instant quote where we say something like plus free bonus coupon just to kind

10:37.220 --> 10:41.060
of get them more interested again checking with the client and see if they

10:41.060 --> 10:44.860
could even offer a slight coupon or something like that if they don't then

10:44.860 --> 10:51.820
just remove that and we're going to center that let's make that bold as well

10:52.220 --> 10:58.740
see it and then lastly the button right here see how it's skirted to the left we

10:58.740 --> 11:04.580
want to make a center as well so just click on the main thing you're going to

11:04.580 --> 11:10.220
click on button you're going to align it to the center and we're actually going

11:10.220 --> 11:16.220
to change what it says I like I would like to say get quote exclamation point

11:16.220 --> 11:23.380
then click out of it then oops I don't know why I did that it's not a problem

11:23.380 --> 11:27.140
just move them back how they wear

11:37.660 --> 11:44.020
okay perfect and then one last thing when if you click on form options you can

11:44.060 --> 11:48.700
actually name this and what we like to name it just to keep it organized it

11:48.700 --> 12:01.580
would be the same as the title of the website in our case it's Queen Creek put

12:01.580 --> 12:07.580
the state concrete and then since this is the form for the home page I like to

12:07.580 --> 12:12.300
put in parentheses I like to put an H you can also put home whatever you are

12:12.340 --> 12:16.700
more comfortable with something like that and then right here is where you're

12:16.700 --> 12:21.980
going to put the email you want this form sent to you so I'm just gonna put

12:21.980 --> 12:29.340
my email I wait every time I get this form so I get forwarded to mine okay

12:29.340 --> 12:35.660
then click save and we're done with the form creation okay now I would like to

12:35.660 --> 12:39.060
put more sections because especially on the home page we're going to add a lot

12:39.060 --> 12:47.340
of content so go right here under structure you're going to select section

12:47.340 --> 12:52.940
and you're going to drag it right below right here I like to put a couple of

12:52.940 --> 12:59.780
section because this is the very first one let's put a second one okay and then

12:59.780 --> 13:11.700
we're going to add some titles in here and text then you can put a divider once

13:11.700 --> 13:15.980
we have the content and we're adding the content we can also switch things out

13:15.980 --> 13:21.460
but just to have it there already prepared for us we'll do this and then

13:21.460 --> 13:32.780
let's use this for images so let's put some images perfect let's add another

13:32.780 --> 13:49.180
section underneath text put a divider spacer another title up here and we'll

13:49.180 --> 13:52.540
go more in depth in the next videos about content and how to structure that

13:52.540 --> 14:00.860
so don't worry about it right now right now we're just framing out our asset and

14:00.860 --> 14:10.140
here at the bottom okay so this is the home page now what we usually do for our

14:10.140 --> 14:14.820
websites and this depends on your competitors so when you do the due

14:14.820 --> 14:18.220
diligence you're going to have the top three websites are ranking and you're

14:18.260 --> 14:22.500
going to see what their website looks look like if your competitor has ten

14:22.500 --> 14:26.940
service pages we definitely want to beat them but on average what we like to do

14:26.940 --> 14:34.340
is create one home page three service pages and a contact page so what you do

14:34.340 --> 14:38.980
after this one is the frame is built out you click on pages and you're actually

14:38.980 --> 14:43.060
going to click on the plus sign right here we are going to make a non

14:43.260 --> 14:48.460
clickable menu this is where you'll have drop down with the services and you're

14:48.460 --> 14:59.420
going to put the page name as services out of it done okay now click I would

14:59.420 --> 15:02.820
actually like to just duplicate the home page because we already have that quote

15:02.820 --> 15:11.100
form it just saves you time so click on home and click on copy and it's just

15:11.100 --> 15:15.460
going to duplicate it so we're going to change the name of it you're going to in

15:15.460 --> 15:20.900
my sample for my client I would like to call this stamped concrete that's one of

15:20.900 --> 15:24.220
the main services and again you want to pick the three service pages to

15:24.220 --> 15:30.260
represent the main most searched three services in that niche in that location

15:30.260 --> 15:36.100
that your client covers okay make sure there's nothing in the SEO settings

15:36.100 --> 15:40.820
always make sure and you're very attentive to details this is very

15:40.820 --> 15:47.140
important when you do things like that okay so the title and the number will

15:47.140 --> 15:52.540
always remain consistent and the same in every page down here the h1 we haven't

15:52.540 --> 15:56.160
even put in so we don't need to worry about the only thing is remember when we

15:56.160 --> 16:01.300
created the quote form in the form name just make sure you switch that I just I

16:01.300 --> 16:06.500
would just put service one oops service one save it and then everything else

16:06.500 --> 16:13.220
can stay the same we should actually add the phone number at the bottom as well

16:13.220 --> 16:18.140
so let's make a separate section right here at the bottom so we don't forget

16:18.140 --> 16:24.620
and drag a title in and we're going to put another the same phone number we're

16:24.620 --> 16:28.220
just going to put it down align it in the center and let's do that on the

16:28.220 --> 16:31.940
homepage as well so right at the bottom after you're done writing all of your

16:31.940 --> 16:40.220
content you're going to have a section that is just having the phone number

16:40.220 --> 16:48.140
xxxx align the center let's create the other two pages and once you're done so

16:48.140 --> 16:51.860
this looks perfect the only thing is we want to make it underneath the service

16:51.860 --> 16:56.700
how you do that see you just see when you screwed it over it gives that gap

16:56.700 --> 17:04.260
right here and boom it's right here so let's just copy this one as well and

17:04.260 --> 17:09.100
make sure that it's underneath there as well we're going to call this concrete

17:09.100 --> 17:17.380
driveway make sure the quote form says s2 so you know this is service page

17:17.380 --> 17:24.900
number two and then we're going to copy it again make our last service page and

17:24.900 --> 17:28.860
again you can go in and add it and make as many as you like this is just the

17:28.860 --> 17:35.780
average of what we usually do I'm going to call this patio and just make sure the

17:35.780 --> 17:42.140
quote form says three and then we're going to add a contact page the contact

17:42.140 --> 17:49.660
page is very simple it's actually going to be so it's not going to be under

17:50.220 --> 17:56.980
so we want home services and home again that is going to be contact contact us

17:56.980 --> 18:03.100
and then you can actually delete every section because the only thing the

18:03.100 --> 18:07.980
contact page is going to have is a big form to fill out for them and then on

18:07.980 --> 18:13.900
the contact page we also add the link to the Google My Business so we definitely

18:13.900 --> 18:18.180
want this phone number down there but you can go ahead and delete the content

18:18.180 --> 18:23.980
and just have the main quote form right here I don't know why did that see

18:23.980 --> 18:28.660
that's why you want to pay attention to you tell sometimes often designer we

18:28.660 --> 18:31.820
believe it we believe in general we have little glitches so you want to make sure

18:31.820 --> 18:38.820
that everything looks how we first set it up on every page

18:39.020 --> 18:50.260
name number and email going to save it see it's already looking different for

18:50.260 --> 18:58.660
some reason so just make sure it all looks the same

19:08.860 --> 19:15.700
save again attention to details is very important when you're building out this

19:15.700 --> 19:20.220
framework so just make sure that everything looks consistent because if

19:20.220 --> 19:23.780
it if it doesn't you know if you have stuff like this coming up to someone

19:23.780 --> 19:29.300
it's going to look not very professional so just touch it up make sure you're

19:29.300 --> 19:32.700
checking every page even if we did duplicate them just double and triple

19:32.740 --> 19:40.540
check on things being very consistent on each page same with the header and you

19:40.540 --> 19:48.260
again you shouldn't have to do this all the time sometimes it does this

20:02.700 --> 20:25.580
see that pretty sure there you go okay service to last service page and we are

20:25.620 --> 20:46.420
almost done building the frame of our asset right here make sure you always

20:46.420 --> 20:53.980
click save as well and then perfect this looks good the only thing that sometimes

20:54.100 --> 21:00.060
we like to do but this is totally optional click on build and sometimes

21:00.060 --> 21:04.180
just to make the quote pop especially if you're using a white background under

21:04.180 --> 21:11.500
the header so just like this one is called we like to use a color block so

21:11.500 --> 21:16.180
just drag this right above the quote okay like that and then you're going to

21:16.180 --> 21:22.740
drag the whole quote form in it like that now it's not going to look like it's

21:22.740 --> 21:29.020
anything but you can actually change that's how you make the quote in a

21:29.020 --> 21:34.860
different color and this sucks in Weebly but you it's you don't only have this

21:34.860 --> 21:39.820
option you can actually put your own colors here and how you do that is I

21:39.820 --> 21:46.020
think if you click here and change color it will give you a color palette okay I

21:46.060 --> 21:55.100
know it's at the bottom but let's say we wanted to make it a nice and bright

21:55.100 --> 22:05.980
yellow a little more orange like that you can copy this code I don't know why

22:05.980 --> 22:16.860
it's not copying it click out of it change color okay I'm just going to write

22:16.860 --> 22:25.780
it down so it's F1 AB 40 okay you click again on the color block and you change

22:25.780 --> 22:30.860
color and you can insert your own color so you don't have to pick out of these

22:30.860 --> 22:37.980
ones one eight be forty click out of it and it will make it that color okay

22:37.980 --> 22:44.860
perfect and it moved the surfaces again

22:51.940 --> 22:57.220
okay perfect and you're going to this to do this for every page again now you're

22:57.220 --> 23:00.460
probably looking at the quote from this is one when you make colors and

23:00.460 --> 23:03.860
adjustments and stuff like that you're going to see well you can't really see

23:03.860 --> 23:07.780
here right and if you click up here in this desktop you can actually see how

23:07.780 --> 23:14.180
the website would look on phone so keep that in mind as well like this looks

23:14.180 --> 23:20.420
gigantic it looks silly on a phone so and the spacer we probably want to remove

23:20.420 --> 23:24.940
because it's a really big gap so click back here and once you we are done

23:24.980 --> 23:29.820
adding the content we're going to do the little touch-ups but just really quick

23:29.820 --> 23:36.020
click on theme this is where you can change the color and the fonts and we

23:36.020 --> 23:42.100
please nice so he actually highlights what things are you see it's going to

23:42.100 --> 23:46.980
highlight that the paragraph title can remain the same the paragraph text we

23:46.980 --> 23:52.100
want to make it black because it's pretty hard to see there you go and then

23:52.100 --> 24:02.060
you can change the font let's try things out okay feel like that's all more

24:02.060 --> 24:06.740
visible and then we are going to delete the spacer again it's totally up to you

24:06.740 --> 24:12.900
just kind of how you see things going and then this we like to do it a

24:12.900 --> 24:24.060
different color and the one above this a little bigger oops make sure you save

24:24.060 --> 24:33.380
save save let's make this a little more yellow and then again this is up to

24:33.380 --> 24:52.140
your preference just can even make it blue okay 40 CDF one see if that looks

24:52.140 --> 24:59.860
better again don't overthink this but you can definitely make smaller

24:59.860 --> 25:09.380
adjustments okay and we are done building the frame
