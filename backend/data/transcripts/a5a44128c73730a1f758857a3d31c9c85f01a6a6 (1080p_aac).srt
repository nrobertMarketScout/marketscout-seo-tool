00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
["Money, Love, Speed"]

2
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:13,080
Guys, welcome to Money, Love, Speed.

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,360
And we're gonna talk really quickly.

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,800
I'm gonna share what the one-pager is,

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,040
why we use it, and then when we should use it.

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,200
Okay, I'm gonna go really quick.

7
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,040
We're gonna get this done,

8
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,840
because guys, let's go make some money.

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,320
Number one, what it is.

10
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,200
Very, very simple.

11
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,360
Think about a website and think about the home page, okay?

12
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,240
So, we're not gonna build that entire website.

13
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,760
We're not gonna have service pages, location pages,

14
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,200
about us, all that crap.

15
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,280
We're not going to do that.

16
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,720
We are gonna build a one-page landing page

17
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,760
that we're gonna send traffic to,

18
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,120
and that traffic is gonna convert into leads,

19
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,700
and we're gonna do the least amount of work possible,

20
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,160
the minimal viable product.

21
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,580
We're gonna just have enough

22
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:50,960
where people are gonna hit the website

23
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,760
and they're gonna call the phone, fill out the form,

24
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,560
we're gonna generate leads, okay?

25
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,280
It's very simple, don't overthink it.

26
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,160
Just think about a regular website, a home page, okay?

27
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,600
There are certain things that we do need to include

28
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,040
on this home page, and I'm gonna go over those,

29
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,440
but everything outside of that,

30
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,840
you don't need to worry about that.

31
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,500
I will tell you, it is worth your time

32
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,520
taking your time building your template

33
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,320
for this first go-around.

34
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,800
Then after that, you can literally copy and paste it

35
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,700
and switch out the content, switch out the words,

36
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,480
switch out the, or just the same thing,

37
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,040
switch out the background image,

38
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,120
switch out the phone number,

39
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,300
and it becomes very quick and easy, okay?

40
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,900
So, that's what a one-pager is,

41
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,660
and some of you guys are watching this video

42
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:33,300
and you are going to go pre-sell a site, okay?

43
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,380
Great, welcome.

44
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,580
Some of you guys went and you sold a site

45
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:38,620
that you already had,

46
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:41,940
and now you're getting ready to pre-sell a site, okay?

47
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:45,220
There's gonna be multiple different reasons why you're here,

48
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,360
but this is what you're going to do, okay?

49
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,200
So, why do we do it?

50
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,760
Well, number one is speed.

51
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,860
We want to do this as quickly as possible.

52
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,380
We wanna do this as quickly as possible,

53
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,020
as cheaply as possible,

54
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,560
because, as I've said many, many, many times,

55
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,900
money loves speed, okay?

56
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,460
So, we wanna do that as quickly as possible,

57
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,620
and that is why we're going to be building the one-pager.

58
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,260
So, speed, speed, speed.

59
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,260
Secondly, we are gonna be building this

60
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:09,500
on what's called a sub-domain.

61
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,660
So, we're gonna be doing a .wix, a .weebly,

62
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,340
whatever, you could use WordPress.

63
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,500
We're gonna be doing this on a sub-domain,

64
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,440
and what that means is we don't have to pay for the domain.

65
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,860
So, instead of having to go buy the, you know,

66
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:27,020
cedarcityconcrete.com or minneapolisconcrete.com,

67
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:30,500
this is gonna be minneapolisconcrete.weebly.com,

68
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,500
and we're not gonna have to pay for it.

69
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,900
So, speed, cost.

70
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,740
The other thing that's really awesome about this

71
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,460
is it allows us to test the market

72
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,580
without having ongoing recurring costs.

73
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,900
So, it has kind of a combination

74
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,660
between the other two things that I said.

75
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,900
We're gonna be able to build this one-pager

76
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,620
for very little time, very little money,

77
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:48,580
and quickly go and test the market,

78
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,220
and if it doesn't work,

79
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,580
we spend a little bit of money on ads,

80
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:52,420
and there's no buyers,

81
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,900
or we spend a little bit of money on ads,

82
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,220
and no one calls,

83
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,500
we didn't spend all of our time, effort, and money

84
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,100
building out a full website.

85
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,900
So, those are just a couple of reasons

86
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,060
why this is such a valuable tool.

87
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,940
The thing I love the most, above all, is the speed.

88
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,820
The fact that I could literally look at a project

89
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,220
and say, hey, I need a one-pager in Minneapolis

90
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,580
for concrete, and I could have that one one-hour's time,

91
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,260
and I would have no money spent into it.

92
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,460
That is a amazing thing, okay?

93
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:21,440
So, that's what it is, why we do it,

94
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,920
and then thirdly is, when should you do the one-pager?

95
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,280
Okay, when should you do,

96
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,880
when should you utilize these one-pagers?

97
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,440
And it's up to you, this is your business.

98
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,240
You're free to go build out full sites, okay?

99
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,240
You're free to do your homework on the niche in the city,

100
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,000
and just go build the full Monty.

101
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,200
That's you, if you hate money, go do that, okay?

102
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,480
However, I'm gonna tell you that the answer to this

103
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,920
is I use the one-pager every single time,

104
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,000
every single time.

105
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,920
Let me give you one example.

106
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,200
So, we have a client right now, he's a masonry guy.

107
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,320
We call him the other day, we're like, hey, are you happy?

108
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,680
Just kinda checking in, he's like, yeah,

109
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,520
everything's going great.

110
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,440
He's like, I actually have a friend, he does excavation,

111
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,960
he wants to use you guys,

112
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,720
he wants to get some leads from you guys.

113
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,560
So, keep the deals done, right?

114
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,840
We're crushing it for this one guy,

115
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,000
he referred us to his buddy, deal's done.

116
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,720
We're like, okay, cool, what should we do?

117
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,360
And in the past, I used to just like,

118
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,600
because I got the deal, I'm like, oh, I'll just go

119
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,800
and build out the website because we're using his money.

120
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,720
The deal's already done, right?

121
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,040
That's not what we do anymore.

122
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:25,000
Now what we do is, I'm actually going to sign the deal,

123
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,080
I'm gonna get his money,

124
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,520
but before I go build out the full website,

125
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,120
I'm actually, for the first at least three months,

126
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,240
I'm gonna be running ads to a one-pager.

127
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,360
Now, why would I do that if I already got the deal?

128
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,160
Well, I'm not familiar with excavation.

129
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,640
I don't know if that niche is going to really work

130
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,000
in the city we're targeting.

131
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,920
I just don't, part of my gut tells me

132
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,080
that it's too commercial heavy

133
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,920
and that most people are gonna know who to call.

134
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,760
I don't know if it's gonna work.

135
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,320
So instead of building out a full site,

136
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,520
even though it's his money, I'd rather keep the money,

137
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:03,280
use an MVP, what I mean by MVP is a minimal viable product,

138
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,320
which is like a one-pager, okay?

139
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:08,080
Use a one-pager that costs me no money, no time.

140
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,920
I run it for three months, and if it's crushing it,

141
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,800
okay, cool, in three months, we take some of the profits,

142
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,440
we build out the full website, and we like,

143
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,800
hey, this niche in this city works really well, okay?

144
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,760
However, if we do this, and a couple months in,

145
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,020
we find out, hey, the calls we're getting,

146
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:26,080
they're not really the leads this guy's looking for.

147
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,880
They're kind of just random stuff,

148
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,320
people looking for jobs, whatever it is.

149
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,320
Now I can go to him and say, hey, here's the deal.

150
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,600
We have a six-month agreement,

151
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,400
but this isn't really working.

152
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,840
The niche city doesn't, you know, whatever.

153
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,080
I didn't build out a full website.

154
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,880
I don't have this hosting bill and this tracking number

155
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,080
and all this stuff I gotta take care of.

156
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,160
I didn't have to pay for the content.

157
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,240
I didn't have to pay employees to build this out, right?

158
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,400
And I still made a profit.

159
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,780
So I use the one-pager every single deal.

160
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:56,000
Even if it's a layup, hey, here's a referral,

161
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,680
I use it because I wanna test it

162
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,240
and make sure that I pick the right city.

163
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,160
Maybe I'm looking at the Dallas-Fort Worth area

164
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,760
and I have a guy that covers all the area,

165
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,320
and he's like, hey, I would love to get leads in Arlington.

166
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,840
Okay, cool, so what I'm gonna do

167
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,920
is for the first couple months,

168
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,860
even though I got the deal, it's a referral,

169
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,660
I'm gonna go do a one-pager probably in Arlington,

170
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:16,380
Plano, whatever cities that he's interested in,

171
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:17,700
and I'm probably gonna run a test

172
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,140
with these three different landing pages

173
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,820
to see which one's getting me the cheapest, best leads.

174
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:25,640
Okay, so just a few examples.

175
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,880
One last thing that I really like to use this one-pager for

176
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,940
is if I have a client in a big city, let's say Atlanta,

177
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,800
and we got the deal, I did the one-pager,

178
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,340
we went through the process, I got the deal.

179
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:39,060
But two months later, something happens

180
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,620
that's not ranking that quick,

181
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,780
and the business owner's like,

182
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,860
Nick, I need more leads, or whatever,

183
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:44,820
and they're kinda getting frustrated,

184
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,520
I can tell they're getting frustrated.

185
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,380
What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go and research

186
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,100
some of the suburbs around Atlanta,

187
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,100
so Norcross, Marietta, maybe Flowery Branch,

188
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,980
and I'm gonna do the homework on those.

189
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,540
And then I'm gonna be able to go build one-pagers

190
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:00,260
in Marietta, in Norcross, maybe in Flowery Branch,

191
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:03,260
and run ads to those landing pages

192
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:06,740
and supplement that deal, he doesn't even need to know,

193
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:09,780
say hey, I'm just gonna keep pushing him leads,

194
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,060
he doesn't know that it's coming

195
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,020
from a separate landing page,

196
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,700
they're all just gonna funnel to him,

197
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,520
and it's a way that you can kind of increase the leads

198
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,860
if things get a bit stagnant,

199
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:20,320
and it's a beautiful way to use that one-pager.

200
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,300
So there's a ton of application,

201
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,800
there's a ton of use for these one-pagers,

202
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,380
my biggest piece of advice is learn how to do this,

203
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:34,020
build a kick-ass template, learn how to do it,

204
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,220
master it, and then we can go to the next step,

205
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,220
which is outsource it, but you are going to be using this

206
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:41,660
on every single deal,

207
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:44,320
because we are going to use other people's money

208
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,340
to build our empire.
