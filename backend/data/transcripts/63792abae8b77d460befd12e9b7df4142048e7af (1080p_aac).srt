1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,600
Guys, before we go any further and before we get, you know, jump into this, get started,

2
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:20,920
I want to explain to you and stress the importance of the fact that the money is actually made

3
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,480
in picking the city and the niche combination.

4
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,240
And I really, really mean that it's super, super important.

5
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,840
And so I'm going to use an example from physical real estate.

6
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:35,680
The reason I like to use examples from physical real estate is because we are doing the exact

7
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,360
same thing, but doing it digitally or doing it online.

8
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,440
We want to become digital landlords.

9
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:47,720
So there's a saying in physical real estate, and they always say this, okay, and by they

10
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:52,680
I'm talking about the books, the experts, the gurus, the investors, and they always

11
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:59,080
say the money is made in the buy, not in the sell, okay?

12
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,080
What does that mean?

13
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:05,240
It means that if you're going to go purchase a, let's call it a duplex or a single family

14
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,960
home for $200,000, okay?

15
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:14,600
If you go and you buy a property, a duplex, let's say, that's worth $200,000, but you

16
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:21,200
purchase it for $160,000, you immediately are going to win.

17
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,240
Even if you turn around and you sell it for market value or below market value, you're

18
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,500
going to win because you immediately got $40,000 of equity, right?

19
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,720
You bought it for $160,000, it's worth $200,000.

20
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:39,600
You're going to win no matter what, and likewise, with digital real estate, if you pick the

21
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:46,160
right city and the right niche combination, you are almost guaranteed success, okay?

22
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:50,920
So there's a couple of reasons why this is super, super, super important.

23
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:56,200
All right, reason number one, by choosing the right city and the right niche, you are

24
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:02,360
going to be able to avoid very competitive, heavy SEO.

25
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:06,320
Nothing gets more tiring, nothing burns you out quicker, nothing is more frustrating than

26
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:12,480
just chugging along and doing backlinks and content and this and that and the rest.

27
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,600
It's very, very frustrating, and especially when you know you could put the same amount

28
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:23,040
of time into another niche and city combination and yield much higher results.

29
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,500
You could get ranked much quicker.

30
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:30,740
Number two is by not having to do heavy SEO, it's going to allow you to rank your site

31
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:36,140
quicker, and the quicker you can rank your website, the less money you're going to have

32
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:39,420
to spend on ads, the less money you're going to have to spend on ads, the more money you're

33
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,940
going to put in your pocket, and I think, at least me, the reason I'm here is I'm trying

34
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:43,940
to make money.

35
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:51,020
All right, number three is by picking the right city and niche combination, you are

36
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:57,420
going to be able to find areas where your cost per click on Google Ads, and we're going

37
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:01,340
to get into this, don't stress it, don't freak out if you don't know what that means, and

38
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:04,300
that's called CPC, but this is very, very simple stuff.

39
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:08,060
I'm not going to go into it right this moment, but you're going to be able to find cities

40
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:15,820
and niches where the cost per click is very inexpensive, and what that means is if it's

41
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:23,500
inexpensive for you, it's going to allow you to get more leads, in theory, for less money

42
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:29,340
out of your pocket, which means the business owner is going to get more leads by you spending

43
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:33,900
less money, which means they're going to be happier, and you're going to be able to retain

44
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,460
them longer.

45
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:40,780
So a huge benefit of picking the right city and the right niche combination is you're

46
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:46,060
going to be able to find those combos where you're going to find inexpensive ads, and

47
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,060
that is going to make all the difference in the world.

48
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,220
Trust me, and I have done this correctly, and I've done this incorrectly, and when you

49
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:55,980
do this correctly, it is night and day difference, okay?

50
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:00,620
Lastly, by doing this correctly, and it kind of goes back to what I said in the beginning,

51
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:04,300
doing this correctly almost guarantees your success.

52
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:09,740
If you can pick a city and you can pick a niche where there's low competition, there's

53
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:15,660
good search volume, meaning people are looking for that service, there's low cost per click,

54
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:21,100
means inexpensive advertising, and there's people that are willing to pay for your advertising,

55
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:26,780
say willing to pay for your leads, let me say it that way, you are almost guaranteed success.

56
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:30,940
Now, obviously, you have to put in the work because I can't do it for you, but these are

57
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:34,940
going to eliminate all the pitfalls that most people run into, okay?

58
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:40,540
And I will tell you this, I have done this incorrectly, and when I first got into rank

59
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:46,140
and rent, I took a couple of programs, and these programs, they told me how to pick my

60
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:52,220
city and niche, and maybe at the time that was more up to date, maybe I didn't listen

61
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:57,740
100% correctly, but I do a pretty good job of doing that, of actually paying attention

62
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:02,780
and doing stuff exactly, and I did it the way they taught, and I'll tell you that about

63
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:07,740
four weeks ago from the time of recording right this moment, I went through and audited

64
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:16,060
all my sites, and I went and I got rid of 125, 125, 125 of my websites that I built years

65
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:23,740
and years and years ago, that it's going to take me months, if not years, of just solid,

66
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:28,540
heavy SEO to even consider getting ranked. On top of that, my advertising is going to

67
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:35,260
be expensive, and for me, it just wasn't worth the squeeze, okay? So, from somebody who's

68
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:40,220
made the mistakes, do not make the same mistake, do not make the same mistake, take your time,

69
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:45,180
I don't care if you need to look at 100 city and niche combinations to pick one, I do not

70
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:49,340
care, it is worth your time, because if you can pick these winners, if you can pick these,

71
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:54,540
what I call layups, it's going to make everything easier, okay? And I'm going to show you an

72
00:05:54,540 --> 00:06:01,020
example of a project I did, this has been a couple of years ago, and this thing has made me

73
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:05,820
an incredible amount of money, I put very little work into it, and it continues to produce over

74
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:11,260
and over and over. Okay, so guys, the project that I did, it was in a city called Bentonville,

75
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:17,420
Arkansas, and this is a city where it's the headquarters of Walmart, but what's interesting

76
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:22,380
is this only has a population of 52,000, and we're going to get into the population metrics

77
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:26,220
and all that kind of stuff and why it doesn't really matter, but it doesn't have a ton of

78
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:30,380
people that actually live there compared to other cities, right? So anyway, I just wanted

79
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:37,500
to point that out, but I went in and I built a project in a city called Bentonville for concrete,

80
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:43,340
okay? And as you can see, I am ranked number one for this term, at least, right? I'm not

81
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:47,740
probably not ranked for every term, but pretty dang close to it. I'm ranked number one here,

82
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:54,220
I'm also the number one in the maps, and you can see there's so few competition in this,

83
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:59,980
there's so few competitors, sorry, that I'm the only one ranking, okay? And so this is what's

84
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:05,420
crazy is if you look at this website, it's a very, very simple website, but if you actually look at

85
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:09,660
the backlink profile, you look at the content, you look at what actually went into this, this

86
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:16,460
isn't that impressive of a website. And what I'm trying to show you, if you do this correctly,

87
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:23,820
you can skip a lot of the other work, and you can make a ton of money. And from this website

88
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:32,060
alone, I have made over $20,000 over the past couple of years with the same exact client

89
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:41,420
paying me every single week on auto pay. So guys, I'm telling you right now, do not, I repeat,

90
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:47,980
do not breeze through this, skip through this, rush through this. This is so crucial that we

91
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:52,300
get this piece right, because it's gonna make all the difference in the world between being profitable

92
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,340
and wanting to bash your head through a wall.
