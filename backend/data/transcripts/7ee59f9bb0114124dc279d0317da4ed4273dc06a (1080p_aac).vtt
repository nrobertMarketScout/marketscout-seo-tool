Okay, Luke says, what do you do for photos on the site before selling the site? I have to get a photo from somewhere

00:05.120 --> 00:09.560
I don't want to get sued. Do you recommend about it? Yeah, I've done stock photos. You could find nice stock photos

00:09.560 --> 00:13.720
It's like dude. Do you pay 10 bucks 15 bucks for a photo? It's not that much money

00:13.720 --> 00:20.440
Even if you put 10 of you know, 150 bucks, it's not much. I do stock. I do pexels.com. I do Pixlr

00:21.240 --> 00:23.680
Just some of these free image sources, right?

00:23.680 --> 00:27.140
It's and I know it kind of gets hard if you're doing the same niche like oh my heck

00:27.860 --> 00:33.940
I'm doing more concrete photos. One thing that I've noticed too that I've done is if you get a client that's in your backyard

00:34.820 --> 00:39.500
Go and go and send one of your people or you yourself take a camera

00:39.500 --> 00:43.660
Take your iPhone go and take a bunch of photos go to one of their job sites and go get a bunch of photos

00:44.580 --> 00:48.060
now you have to be a little bit careful because if you live in a climate that's like

00:48.820 --> 00:52.260
Different like for example, I live somewhere. There's red rocks or stucco houses

00:52.260 --> 00:57.900
It's like a very specific type of climate I could use those photos probably in Phoenix maybe in Vegas, right?

00:57.900 --> 01:00.260
But I'm not gonna be able to use those photos to

01:00.660 --> 01:06.580
Market in Montana because the houses the trees the landscape it's all gonna be different, but I will go to job sites

01:06.580 --> 01:12.140
I've sent my team to multiple job sites to go and take photos and that gives me a bunch of photos

01:12.140 --> 01:15.900
I can use not just on that project, but on future projects in the same niche. Okay
