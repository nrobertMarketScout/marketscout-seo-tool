00:00.000 --> 00:02.200
What are the expectations that we're setting?

00:02.200 --> 00:04.160
There's two different types of expectations, right?

00:04.160 --> 00:06.440
There's expectations in terms of like actual results,

00:06.440 --> 00:08.200
how many leads, how many phone calls,

00:08.200 --> 00:10.320
and then there's expectations in terms of like

00:10.320 --> 00:12.200
when the website's gonna get set up,

00:12.200 --> 00:13.720
when we're gonna be doing this,

00:13.720 --> 00:14.560
we're gonna be doing that,

00:14.560 --> 00:16.160
when things are gonna be live.

00:16.160 --> 00:17.440
What are the expectations

00:17.440 --> 00:20.000
that you are setting with the client?

00:20.000 --> 00:22.320
In terms of like timelines and stuff like that,

00:22.320 --> 00:25.120
I never, and I hate to say this, but I don't promise.

00:25.120 --> 00:26.880
I never say, oh, it's gonna be done

00:26.880 --> 00:28.760
in 72 hours or three days.

00:28.760 --> 00:31.000
I never give them precise answers.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.320
And it's not because I'm trying to be sketchy.

00:33.320 --> 00:36.760
It's because I know from the past that things can happen.

00:36.760 --> 00:39.080
And if I'm 12 hours late or a day late,

00:39.080 --> 00:41.160
I don't want them to think that I'm not reliable.

00:41.160 --> 00:44.680
So I tell them, hey, it's roughly a week,

00:44.680 --> 00:46.840
and then I would rather get it done sooner,

00:46.840 --> 00:49.480
which kind of goes back to how you do sales.

00:49.480 --> 00:52.000
Like you always wanna undersell it.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.880
So that's what I always do.

00:53.880 --> 00:54.800
I don't promise.

00:54.800 --> 00:56.720
If somebody asks like,

00:56.720 --> 00:58.640
how many leads am I supposed to receive?

00:59.480 --> 01:02.560
I never, ever, ever, ever say, oh, a minimum of 10.

01:02.560 --> 01:04.760
Never, because you can't predict that,

01:04.760 --> 01:06.760
and you would be lying if you were telling them,

01:06.760 --> 01:08.840
oh, at least 10, because how do you know

01:08.840 --> 01:10.480
how many people are going to the call?

01:10.480 --> 01:12.680
No matter if you're ranking or not, so.

01:12.680 --> 01:13.560
100%.

01:13.560 --> 01:15.440
And at the end of the day also, it doesn't,

01:15.440 --> 01:17.320
I mean, it does matter how many leads you get them,

01:17.320 --> 01:18.560
but what I always try to,

01:18.560 --> 01:20.360
I always try when I get questions like that,

01:20.360 --> 01:21.960
I try to let them know,

01:21.960 --> 01:25.440
hey, this isn't about how many leads I get you.

01:25.440 --> 01:28.440
This is about how much money you make, right?

01:29.240 --> 01:31.160
Because if I only sent you three leads a month,

01:31.160 --> 01:33.960
but you knew you were gonna close all three of those deals

01:33.960 --> 01:36.680
and you were gonna make X amount of money,

01:36.680 --> 01:38.960
you know, that was gonna be a three X

01:38.960 --> 01:40.800
on the money you're spending with me,

01:40.800 --> 01:42.440
you wouldn't care how many leads.

01:42.440 --> 01:45.960
So at the end of the day, I always like to let them know

01:45.960 --> 01:47.640
and like try to frame it as like,

01:47.640 --> 01:50.160
I care more about how much money they make

01:50.160 --> 01:52.160
than I do about how many leads I'm getting them,

01:52.160 --> 01:54.960
because I know I could get them 100 leads a month,

01:54.960 --> 01:56.400
but if they're not making money,

01:56.400 --> 01:58.000
whether it's my fault or not,

01:58.000 --> 01:59.480
they're going to eventually cancel.

01:59.480 --> 02:00.320
So that's number one.

02:00.320 --> 02:02.360
The other thing you have to just set expectations

02:02.360 --> 02:03.560
that I would just add,

02:03.560 --> 02:06.640
and I think that we do this more during the actual sale

02:07.600 --> 02:09.480
when you're closing the deal,

02:09.480 --> 02:11.640
is I like to let them know,

02:11.640 --> 02:14.440
the reason that we do a six month contract

02:14.440 --> 02:18.800
is because we're gonna take the average of the six months.

02:18.800 --> 02:20.920
Okay, we're gonna take the average

02:20.920 --> 02:22.440
of how many leads came in,

02:22.440 --> 02:23.760
how many deals were closed,

02:23.760 --> 02:24.800
how much money was made,

02:24.800 --> 02:27.040
how much money was put in their pocket

02:27.040 --> 02:29.480
over a six month period.

02:29.480 --> 02:32.160
Because if we look at one month,

02:32.160 --> 02:33.320
let's say we do a deal,

02:33.320 --> 02:34.640
and I always explain this to the business owner,

02:34.640 --> 02:36.960
I say, hey, Mr. Business Owner, it's spring,

02:36.960 --> 02:38.480
we just got tax returns back,

02:38.480 --> 02:41.080
everyone's spending money on cleaning up the yard.

02:41.080 --> 02:44.120
If we do a one month deal in April,

02:44.120 --> 02:45.440
because it's tax season,

02:45.440 --> 02:48.120
and we get you X amount of leads,

02:48.120 --> 02:49.760
is it safe to assume that we're gonna get you

02:49.760 --> 02:51.600
that many leads every single month?

02:51.600 --> 02:53.120
And of course the answer is no,

02:53.120 --> 02:55.320
because that's gonna be a really good month, right?

02:55.320 --> 02:57.200
And likewise, if it's December,

02:57.200 --> 02:58.520
and I only get you one lead,

02:58.520 --> 03:00.480
because it's Christmas and no one wants to spend,

03:00.480 --> 03:02.000
is it safe to assume that every month

03:02.000 --> 03:03.040
is gonna be like that?

03:03.040 --> 03:04.400
Well, no, of course not.

03:04.400 --> 03:07.080
So, okay, Mr. Business Owner, just so you know,

03:07.080 --> 03:08.800
the reason we're doing this for six months

03:08.800 --> 03:11.160
is I need you to be patient with me.

03:11.160 --> 03:13.440
We're gonna have some months that are gonna be great,

03:13.440 --> 03:14.280
we're gonna have some months

03:14.280 --> 03:15.360
that are not gonna be great,

03:15.360 --> 03:16.280
we're gonna have some days

03:16.280 --> 03:17.600
you're gonna get multiple leads,

03:17.600 --> 03:20.240
we're gonna have some weeks that you get no leads.

03:20.240 --> 03:21.360
But the thing that we're looking at

03:21.360 --> 03:23.800
is the average of the six months.

03:23.800 --> 03:25.080
And so that's why I need you to give me

03:25.080 --> 03:26.400
this six month period.

03:26.400 --> 03:28.040
At the end of the six months,

03:28.040 --> 03:29.840
if you've done your job and I've done my job

03:29.840 --> 03:31.200
and it's just not working,

03:31.200 --> 03:34.200
then trust me, I'll be the first one to cut this thing off.

03:35.560 --> 03:36.400
That's it.

03:36.400 --> 03:39.120
It's the pullback, but it's also just being real.

03:39.120 --> 03:44.120
Like, it's so, sometimes it's so hard to like,

03:44.280 --> 03:47.400
you know, we were getting the deal and we're excited,

03:47.400 --> 03:48.680
and we want every,

03:48.680 --> 03:51.400
we wanna give everyone the best answer, right?

03:51.400 --> 03:52.680
So, you know, people are like,

03:52.680 --> 03:57.120
hey, so, you know, how quickly will you have this done?

03:57.120 --> 03:58.800
And sometimes we're like, we wanna be like,

03:58.800 --> 03:59.880
yeah, it'll be done in two days

03:59.880 --> 04:01.680
because it's been that way before,

04:01.680 --> 04:03.080
but we don't know for sure.

04:03.080 --> 04:05.480
And we somehow wanna impress this client

04:05.480 --> 04:08.480
and we say stupid stuff that keeps like, ties us in.

04:08.480 --> 04:11.200
It's so much better to just pause and go,

04:11.200 --> 04:14.440
you know what, we've done it in as little as a few days,

04:14.440 --> 04:16.040
but just to be realistic with you,

04:16.040 --> 04:18.200
I would plan on like giving us at minimum,

04:18.200 --> 04:20.360
you know, seven to 10 days,

04:20.360 --> 04:21.800
just in case something happens.

04:21.800 --> 04:23.960
I'd rather just, you know, plan on that

04:23.960 --> 04:25.000
and then surprise you.

04:26.360 --> 04:27.480
You have no idea.

04:27.480 --> 04:28.320
Do you know what?

04:28.320 --> 04:30.360
Every single time you do something like that,

04:30.360 --> 04:31.520
it builds trust.

04:31.520 --> 04:33.680
Every time you do that,

04:33.680 --> 04:35.560
you're different than the last person.

04:35.560 --> 04:37.880
You're different than the last person that told you,

04:37.880 --> 04:39.520
hey, we're gonna get X amount of leads

04:39.520 --> 04:41.000
and we're gonna blow it up and blah, blah, blah,

04:41.000 --> 04:43.480
and then nothing ever happened, right?

04:43.480 --> 04:45.520
So, I love what Matthew said

04:45.520 --> 04:47.600
and it's, I would kind of call that a pullback,

04:47.600 --> 04:48.800
but the deal's already done,

04:48.800 --> 04:50.440
but I would just say just being real

04:50.440 --> 04:52.680
and just being like transparent

04:52.680 --> 04:54.800
and giving an honest answer,

04:54.800 --> 04:56.800
instead of like giving the best case,

04:56.800 --> 04:58.720
give the worst case, okay?

04:58.720 --> 05:00.360
And when you do that,

05:00.360 --> 05:02.920
what we think sometimes it's gonna lose us the deal,

05:02.920 --> 05:05.040
it's gonna make it so we're not gonna get the deal.

05:05.040 --> 05:07.520
Actually, it's gonna solidify the deal.

05:07.520 --> 05:10.320
Actually, it's going to make it seem

05:10.320 --> 05:12.800
like we're actually legitimate and we're real

05:12.800 --> 05:14.400
and we're gonna take care of them.
