if nobody answers, would you leave a voicemail? And as long as it was just kind of vague,
you would. Anytime I call leave or call for prospecting, I call twice. I call, hang up,
call again. Because it's like, it's aggressive. It's different. It doesn't look like spam. Like
most spam calls once and they're done. And then I'll leave a voicemail and I'll do a text with
that same format. Hey, this is so-and-so asking about a job. Give me a call.
Okay.
