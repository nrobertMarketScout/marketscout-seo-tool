Curtis Horn, by the way, thanks for your question, bro.

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,160
He said, I have tried concrete, now trying spray foam.

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,880
I'd like to give a couple of others niches to try as well.

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,760
Are masonry and artificial grass good candidates?

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,600
So here's the deal, you know, masonry,

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,240
I've made a decent amount of money in masonry,

7
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,440
so I would say yes, artificial grass is the same.

8
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,680
Artificial grass, I would go out on a limb

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,840
and say it's probably been tapped a little bit

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,840
because it's the thing that we use for the training.

11
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,520
And artificial grass isn't like concrete

12
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,480
where it's done every single location.

13
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,560
So artificial grass, you're gonna find deals,

14
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,800
but you're gonna have to look a little bit harder,

15
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,000
but it's a good niche and so is masonry, okay?

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,840
So yes, yes to both.
