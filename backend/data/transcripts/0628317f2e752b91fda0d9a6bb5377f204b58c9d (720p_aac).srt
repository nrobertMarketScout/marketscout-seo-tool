Nick says, one more question on my end. Do you still go into city niche combo that looks like

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:10,560
the lowest hanging fruit, but nobody's paying for ads at my stage? Yes, I will. If it's low

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:16,560
hanging fruit. Okay. If you don't have enough money where the bills are paid and some move on.

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,560
Okay. Where I'm at right now, it's like, if I see it, like, for example, I remember seeing,

5
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,600
I was doing research and I saw this window tinting, don't love the niche, but I had a feeling

6
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,800
that I would be able to sell it because it was local to where I'm at. And it's so low hanging

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,200
guys. It was like the stupidest thing ever. And I was like, I don't even know if I want to do this,

8
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,320
but it was so low hanging. I'm like, I have to do it. We put up a website. I did zero SEO. I'm

9
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,240
talking zero, not a backlink, not nothing. And the site ranked. Okay. So if I see those opportunities,

10
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:50,480
I'll build them because it literally sometimes can be 45, 60 days. Those suckers are ranking,

11
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,560
which by the way, in these last modules, we're going to be releasing, you guys are going to

12
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,920
learn those strategies. You can start implementing those so that you can get those sites ranked.

13
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:06,320
But where I'm at now, yes. But as far as like for you, I probably wouldn't recommend it until

14
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,840
you get to a certain level. Okay. Now those are, I'm talking, those, what I'm just to clarify,

15
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:17,840
I'm talking specifically about city niche combinations where I'm okay. If I let that

16
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,240
thing just rank and I don't touch it for six months or three months or two months,

17
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,040
if you're talking about, do you go into a city niche combination, but you need to pre-sell it

18
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,040
type of a thing? Probably not, dude. Probably not. Like if there's not people paying for ads,

19
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,280
there's just too many people willing to pay for ads for me to dick around to that kind of stuff.

20
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,440
Okay. So that's just my personal preference. Can you still sell people that aren't paying for ads?

21
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:47,040
Of course. Of course you can. Okay. Of course you can, but it's just, it's like, why, why,

22
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,360
why make it harder on ourselves than we have to?
