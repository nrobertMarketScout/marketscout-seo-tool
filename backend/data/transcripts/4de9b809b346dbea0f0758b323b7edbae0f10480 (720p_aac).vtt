00:00.000 --> 00:05.360
back to your question that you had for me, which is this tree service deal. So he's wanting to do

00:05.360 --> 00:10.080
600 bucks a month. How much are you doing with ads? 20 bucks a day? Yeah. So we wouldn't make

00:10.080 --> 00:16.640
anything for the first three months. The thing is, he's a killer business owner. The dude's

00:16.640 --> 00:21.280
crushing it. And so I know he's going to like, that's why he closed that one lead. I mean,

00:21.280 --> 00:26.560
I know he's going to close deals. It's just like, really, like for me, it's kind of, to me, it makes

00:26.560 --> 00:29.760
sense. It's like, yeah, I'm not going to make anything for these three months, but for one,

00:29.760 --> 00:33.840
once I get his site ranked and for two, if I do what I say I'm going to do, he's, he's going to

00:33.840 --> 00:39.360
pay me more. Do you think he would have any, would he, would he wiggle at all? If you said, hey bro,

00:39.360 --> 00:44.400
I'm actually going to be spending like that or more than that in ads. Could you do, I was going

00:44.400 --> 00:49.120
to come back at six 50. Yeah, I would. So here's what I would do is I would go to him and I would

00:49.120 --> 00:53.920
just be straight up with them and I'd say, Hey, look, just so you know, the, the long-term strategy

00:54.240 --> 00:57.520
is be like, I don't want to go too in depth, but long-term strategy, we're going to get you

00:57.520 --> 01:04.320
ranked on page one. Okay. And what's going to happen? What's his name? Mark. You ready for

01:04.320 --> 01:10.160
his last name? Yeah. Ingram, Mark Ingram. Of course. We're about to sign on Mark Ingram.

01:11.120 --> 01:15.520
I love it, dude. You're going up to celebrities. So, okay, Mark. So this is what I was,

01:15.520 --> 01:18.400
this is the exact conversation. I say, Mark, so here's the strategy. We're going to rank you

01:18.400 --> 01:23.680
long-term just so you understand that this works. Once you're ranked, it's not going to cost me near

01:23.680 --> 01:28.960
as much to get these leads in the interim while we're ranking. I'm literally going to be spending

01:28.960 --> 01:34.480
$20 a day. And the way that Google does it, it's $20 times 30.4. It's going to cost me $608

01:35.360 --> 01:41.680
just to run the ads. It's not even including my time. So Mark, what if we did this? What if you

01:41.680 --> 01:45.040
help me out a little bit? What if we do this? And I would, I would go higher. I would say,

01:45.040 --> 01:50.080
what if we do something at like just a three month deal? We do it for 800 bucks a month. You

01:50.080 --> 01:55.200
know exactly how much I'm making. And at the end of the three months, if you can help me get a

01:55.200 --> 02:01.200
Google My Business, which I just need an address and whatever, whatever, whatever, my goal would

02:01.200 --> 02:07.840
be to help get us ranked organically. That's the play. And then as we start to get some organic

02:07.840 --> 02:15.040
leads, then I'll try my very best to keep that price at or around 800, even once we're ranking.

02:15.040 --> 02:19.120
So I would just shoot him straight and be like, dude, at that price, I would love to do it,

02:19.120 --> 02:23.120
but I'm not going to make, I'm actually going to lose money. And that's not even including my time.

02:23.840 --> 02:29.360
However, if you would be down and you, you know, have a good feeling about this partnership,

02:30.000 --> 02:35.840
give me a little bit more. So I have a little bit to cover my time and let's do a three month deal.

02:35.840 --> 02:42.000
We'll do everything we can to get you leads. And also it's going to pick up because the season's

02:42.000 --> 02:46.480
going to change and it's going to get warmer. And you know, just naturally, if nothing else

02:46.480 --> 02:49.920
changes, it's going to pick up. So I would, I would definitely hit him higher. I hit him at like

02:49.920 --> 02:55.360
800 and just hit him and say, dude, I'm going to be, my hard cost of this thing, $608 without

02:55.360 --> 03:00.400
even paying for hosting or my time. So you're going to tell them that. And then just, would you,

03:00.400 --> 03:04.720
would you though, like, would you like, if they're like not, not budget, would you stay, would you go

03:04.720 --> 03:10.160
with a, would you do that other deal though? I might do that other deal. And then what I would

03:10.160 --> 03:16.240
might do is I might bump the ads down to like $15 a day. And then I would just, you know,

03:16.480 --> 03:22.480
do everything that I could to get the Google My Business listing going, get it going. And I mean,

03:22.480 --> 03:26.320
I'd have to be making a little bit of money to make it worth my time. But yeah, if he agrees

03:26.320 --> 03:32.800
to 600, cool. Like then I'll drop the budget to, you know, $15 a day and, and focus on my ads or

03:32.800 --> 03:37.920
whatever and just get, you know, Google My Business. So yeah, I mean, but you can DM me,

03:37.920 --> 03:41.600
we can talk a little bit more. I'll get a little more context, but that's, I would first start at

03:41.600 --> 03:46.640
the 800 mark and just explain. And everyone gets weird. They're like, Oh, I don't want to tell the

03:46.640 --> 03:52.400
business owner that I'm running ads. Dude, who cares? It's like, was this guy running ads when

03:52.400 --> 03:57.840
you called him? Yo, he's spinning, like he did this to see the heart that he's like all he he's

03:57.840 --> 04:03.840
canceling some newspaper ads. So he's spending a lot, like it ain't the money. That's not the

04:03.840 --> 04:08.400
objection. It's, it's, and I understand, cause it's, it's just been so slow. He's worried about

04:08.400 --> 04:12.400
spending 800 a month and only getting three leads. So say this, or you could say this,

04:12.400 --> 04:15.360
you could say, you could do something like this. You could say, let's do a hybrid. Let's do,

04:15.360 --> 04:20.480
let's do a six month deal. We'll do $600 for the next three months. And then the last three months,

04:21.280 --> 04:25.600
assuming that this picks up, let's bump it up to a thousand and you could do some kind of like a

04:25.600 --> 04:34.400
escalated like a contract. Okay. Yeah. No, not, but, or the hybrid is, let's just do 800 across

04:34.400 --> 04:38.080
the board. And you're going to get a few less leads for the next three months,

04:38.080 --> 04:41.200
but you're going to get a lot more than that last three, but I'm not going to charge you more.

04:41.760 --> 04:45.120
Yep. So cool. That makes sense.
