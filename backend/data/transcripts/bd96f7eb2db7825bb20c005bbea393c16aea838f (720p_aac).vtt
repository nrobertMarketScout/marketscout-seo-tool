WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.760
Okay guys welcome to the call Monday August 26th. Again we apologize for a

00:08.760 --> 00:13.240
little bit of a delay. We got a little bit of a confusion with the link so

00:13.240 --> 00:15.960
we'll make sure that doesn't happen next week but I want to let you guys know

00:15.960 --> 00:21.480
first and foremost the only thing that we require on this call is that if what

00:21.480 --> 00:24.360
what we do at the end of every one of these calls and this is your first one

00:24.360 --> 00:28.080
is we're going to take all the information that we give you guys and we

00:28.080 --> 00:32.040
are going to put it into a digital resource that looks pretty that's

00:32.040 --> 00:37.000
condensed and then anybody that stays on this call with their camera on till the

00:37.000 --> 00:40.180
end we're gonna take a screenshot and then we're gonna send you guys this

00:40.180 --> 00:44.360
digital resource and the reason why is it because we're like power hungry it's

00:44.360 --> 00:47.520
because we want to make sure that people are paying attention and they're sitting

00:47.520 --> 00:51.880
there or you could be driving too but we want to make sure that you guys are

00:51.880 --> 00:55.920
actually the ones that are are here for the right reason and so in the past

00:56.080 --> 01:00.200
we've had people jump on these lives and all they're they're just here to consume

01:00.200 --> 01:05.680
and take and take and take and so I've said this before but I would rather four

01:05.680 --> 01:09.120
people be on this live I'd rather one person be on this live that really wants

01:09.120 --> 01:13.040
to take action than have a hundred people that do not and so that's all

01:13.040 --> 01:16.520
that we ask keep your camera on we understand you got to be moving maybe

01:16.520 --> 01:19.720
you've got to be doing this or that or the rest that's fine at the end of this

01:19.720 --> 01:23.960
live we will take a screenshot sent in send you that digital resource so then

01:23.960 --> 01:27.120
you don't have to take sit here and take notes on everything that I give you

01:27.120 --> 01:31.080
you can that'll come as a digital resource what I would rather you guys do

01:31.080 --> 01:36.200
is take notes on the things that come to your mind so I'm gonna say things today

01:36.200 --> 01:39.560
that are gonna give you ideas they're gonna remind you to reach out to this

01:39.560 --> 01:44.960
person or oh that person has this business or I should do this those are

01:44.960 --> 01:47.360
the things I want you to take notes on because all the information I'm gonna

01:47.360 --> 01:51.160
share today I am going to be sending you as long as you just stay on this call

01:51.160 --> 01:55.800
and keep your camera on but guys welcome again once again to the call my

01:55.800 --> 02:04.120
goal for well let me just say this first I I I don't believe you guys should

02:04.120 --> 02:09.240
listen or believe anything that I say and that's not like some catchy phrase

02:09.240 --> 02:13.560
whatever but I truly anything that I share with you I want you to ask

02:13.560 --> 02:19.200
yourself why should I listen to this guy and then I want you to go and test it I

02:19.200 --> 02:22.400
don't ever want you just to take my word because if you take my word you're

02:22.400 --> 02:26.080
gonna take the next guy and the next gal and and that's a scary place to be

02:26.080 --> 02:31.600
because 99% of people are full of crap okay all right so um but for those that

02:31.600 --> 02:36.000
don't know me I've been doing this eight years made in 2020 made my first

02:36.000 --> 02:38.720
million dollars doing this and that's not from selling a coaching program

02:38.720 --> 02:42.680
that's literally from building simple websites ranking them on Google and

02:42.680 --> 02:47.440
renting them out and that's that my business was built brick by brick it was

02:47.440 --> 02:53.560
$500 a month thousand dollar a month $500 a month $2,000 a month $2,500

02:53.560 --> 02:57.800
thousand dollar all that first thousand dollar grew to five thousand and it was

02:57.800 --> 03:01.680
literally just brick by brick by brick by brick and the difference between

03:01.680 --> 03:07.200
barely scraping by and getting to a hundred thousand dollars a month in

03:07.200 --> 03:12.600
July of 2020 and never looking back is that I figured out a few key things that

03:12.600 --> 03:15.760
made all the difference in the world and some of you guys on this call have been

03:15.760 --> 03:20.640
thinking about this business model or doing this business model for years or

03:20.640 --> 03:25.400
months or weeks some of you guys have known about this business model for over

03:25.400 --> 03:28.840
ten years and some of you guys have been in other programs and you just can't

03:28.840 --> 03:32.560
have this you haven't had the success that you want and I feel your pain and

03:32.560 --> 03:38.920
that's why I'm doing these calls okay so I so wish that when I was trying to

03:38.920 --> 03:43.520
scale that I would have had somebody that had done what I wanted to do and

03:43.520 --> 03:46.960
what I wanted to do was make a hundred thousand dollars in a month doing this

03:46.960 --> 03:53.560
and nobody that I knew and to this day I still do not know anybody else besides

03:53.560 --> 03:57.360
myself that has done a hundred thousand dollars per month doing this now I know

03:57.360 --> 04:01.160
some people have messaged me oh this guy in this country and this guy in this

04:01.160 --> 04:04.760
state but personally I do not know anybody else that has made a hundred

04:04.760 --> 04:10.640
thousand dollars per month doing this business model and so for me this is what

04:10.640 --> 04:16.840
I wish I had okay what I want to mention really quick before I forget is and I'm

04:16.840 --> 04:22.680
gonna have either Aaron or Jason share this we actually decided to start a

04:22.680 --> 04:28.800
podcast based based on and completely around digital real estate all things

04:28.800 --> 04:33.840
it's it's very niche it's very nuanced it's very in the weeds it's complete

04:33.840 --> 04:37.420
it's not just taking lives and putting it on a podcast these are separate

04:37.420 --> 04:42.340
episodes these are separate topics this is taking my my time to do this but we

04:42.340 --> 04:47.660
just launched a podcast on Spotify it's on Apple podcast as well so Aaron or

04:47.660 --> 04:52.060
Jason here shortly if you don't maybe I can do it really quick hold on I don't

04:52.060 --> 04:55.860
know if you guys have I'm gonna drop it in the comments so that you guys can

04:55.860 --> 05:02.580
check out the first episode and I would love to get your feedback on this

05:02.580 --> 05:06.660
digital real estate you can type in digital real estate and you'll be able

05:06.660 --> 05:10.860
to find it digital real estate Nick would so let me go ahead and share this

05:10.860 --> 05:18.100
really quick and I'll put it in the comments hold on in the chat I can post

05:18.100 --> 05:21.700
the link if you want I got it there's the Spotify Jason if you want to go

05:21.700 --> 05:27.020
ahead and grab the Apple one that's fine too but yeah there's the podcast again

05:27.020 --> 05:31.420
these are these are episodes specifically for the podcast this first

05:31.420 --> 05:35.940
one is is my story if you guys haven't heard my story already if you have you

05:35.940 --> 05:39.580
guys can skip through part of it but it's a 34 minute episode it's my story

05:39.580 --> 05:43.940
what is digital real estate and we actually have another episode already

05:43.940 --> 05:47.100
filmed that we're gonna be dropping this week and it's gonna be a weekly show so

05:47.100 --> 05:51.620
go ahead if you would like again no pressure you could subscribe to that and

05:51.620 --> 05:55.420
check that out as well that's a nice format to listen to at the gym while

05:55.420 --> 06:01.620
you're driving whatever okay so my goal guys by the end of this call is that

06:01.620 --> 06:06.620
you're gonna have multiple ways that you can use to generate literally

06:06.620 --> 06:11.260
unlimited niche ideas okay niche ideas until you're blue in the face and it's

06:11.260 --> 06:17.420
funny because I like how Aaron started he's like we're gonna answer the

06:17.420 --> 06:22.660
question once and for all is is rank-and-ret saturated right and the I

06:22.660 --> 06:26.700
also hope by the end of this call I don't even have to talk about that I

06:26.700 --> 06:31.380
have made like three four videos on saturation because everyone's number one

06:31.380 --> 06:34.700
question is is this model saturated and I promise you I'm probably gonna do a

06:34.700 --> 06:39.180
podcast episode called the saturation of rank-and-ret because everyone it's like

06:39.180 --> 06:42.380
once we get into something we always want to know am I too late to the game

06:42.380 --> 06:45.980
and so I'm not gonna answer that question right now I'm gonna let you

06:45.980 --> 06:49.460
guys answer that question but just based on what you're gonna hear from me today

06:49.460 --> 06:53.060
you're gonna be able to answer that question okay there is so there's so

06:53.060 --> 06:58.020
many ways there's so many niches out there it's extremely exciting a couple

06:58.580 --> 07:04.220
guys weren't on I literally pulled this out of my desk and this is one of the

07:04.220 --> 07:06.780
methods we're gonna talk about today but I pulled this out this little flyer out

07:06.780 --> 07:11.500
of my desk that came to my mailbox like two years ago and I was like yeah and I

07:11.500 --> 07:14.860
was like that's a really interesting niche and somebody on the call it was

07:14.860 --> 07:18.500
one of my students I believe was like yeah I actually make money in this

07:18.500 --> 07:24.220
niche it's I think the term would be like sheds or portable sheds and the

07:24.220 --> 07:27.940
average ticket price is five thousand dollars and so that was literally just

07:27.940 --> 07:32.340
like an example and I'm gonna I think Francesca's actually built out a site

07:32.340 --> 07:37.900
for this already or we're doing the the the ads for right now but there are so

07:37.900 --> 07:42.800
many niches out there guys it's insane so let's get into this guys also what I

07:42.800 --> 07:49.220
would like you to do is if you have a specific niche in mind I would like you

07:49.300 --> 07:56.020
drop it in the comments and I'm gonna try and save about 15 minutes to do Q&A

07:56.020 --> 08:00.900
and as part of that Q&A I want to be able to let you guys know my opinion on

08:00.900 --> 08:05.820
certain niches and I'll tell you guys if I have personally done it or if it's

08:05.820 --> 08:10.100
just my opinion because I have done a lot of niches but if I haven't I'll give

08:10.100 --> 08:13.820
you my opinion on why I think it would be or wouldn't be a good niche okay okay

08:13.820 --> 08:17.060
so guys here's the plan for today's call number one I'm gonna talk to you guys

08:17.060 --> 08:20.300
about why you should stick to boring niches until your bills are paid number

08:20.300 --> 08:27.260
two why I think you should let other people pay for you to test niches then

08:27.260 --> 08:32.340
we're gonna talk about different methods I've got one two three four five six

08:32.340 --> 08:39.060
seven eight nine I've got ten different methods and that there are so many more

08:39.060 --> 08:44.060
than that but I'm just gonna give you ten ideas of places you can use to go

08:44.060 --> 08:47.700
and find niches that's not ten niches that's ten different places you can

08:47.700 --> 08:52.820
look for niche ideas so there should never be a shortage of ideas for

08:52.820 --> 08:59.300
niches okay so starting off by the way Aaron Jason I'm gonna let you guys be my

08:59.300 --> 09:04.220
eyes and ears if you guys see something that you think is relevant to what I'm

09:04.220 --> 09:09.860
saying cut me off and just unmute yourself and just say hey Nick I want to

09:09.860 --> 09:13.100
you know ask this question because it's pertinent to what you're saying right

09:13.100 --> 09:17.260
now please let me know okay but if not guys start dropping your questions start

09:17.260 --> 09:23.380
dropping your niches inside the comments and let's get going so number one guys

09:23.620 --> 09:29.620
three weeks ago four weeks ago I talked about going vertical versus going broad

09:29.620 --> 09:33.860
you know you know basically going into multiple different niches versus going

09:33.860 --> 09:37.880
into one niche and how I've done both I started off by going into multiple

09:37.880 --> 09:43.600
niches and then I honed into just one and then I told you guys at the end what

09:43.600 --> 09:46.640
I would do if I was starting today which is neither it's a kind of a combination

09:46.640 --> 09:51.040
of both and if you guys didn't get that training sometimes in the free group

09:51.040 --> 09:56.200
we're giving away like you know the stack of trainings so keep an eye out

09:56.200 --> 10:01.320
for that kind of stuff by the way hold on okay I thought that was somebody

10:01.320 --> 10:06.240
unmuting one of my guys okay so um but guys what I mentioned that training the

10:06.240 --> 10:14.160
reason I bring that up is I spent the first I would say well it was it was up

10:14.160 --> 10:21.040
until 2019 I just was testing niches I was literally just testing niches I was

10:21.040 --> 10:25.840
trying anything and everything if I if I talked to somebody I would write it down

10:25.840 --> 10:31.560
and I was like let me try that niche and if I saw you know a business card at the

10:31.560 --> 10:36.680
gym or an advertisement at the gym I would write it down and I would test it

10:36.680 --> 10:43.600
and guys I I probably tried I don't even know man 20 20 to 30 different niches

10:43.600 --> 10:48.080
maybe more and I was making eight to ten thousand dollars a month okay and it

10:48.080 --> 10:53.520
wasn't until the beginning of 2020 when I just had this realization that I was so

10:53.520 --> 11:01.160
spread out I was so my attention was so spread thin that I needed to just focus

11:01.400 --> 11:06.920
and my brain doesn't work like that I I thought you know well Elon Musk has three

11:06.920 --> 11:12.440
companies he's got Solar City he's got Tesla he's got SpaceX I could have a

11:12.440 --> 11:15.800
couple different companies and it's like no I'm not the same as Elon Musk I'm

11:15.800 --> 11:21.160
freaking just as average as can be and I got to stick to one thing so unless

11:21.160 --> 11:27.840
you're Elon Musk my advice to you is simplify get very very simple get very

11:28.080 --> 11:32.880
focused on one thing and I've heard so many different people say this again and

11:32.880 --> 11:37.440
again and again I've heard Alex Hermosy say this I've heard one of Alex Hermosy's

11:37.440 --> 11:41.120
somebody that is a friend of Alex Hermosy that I know I just did this

11:41.120 --> 11:47.120
podcast with this guy in Dubai this is a couple weeks ago and his name is Dan

11:47.120 --> 11:52.680
Henry and this guy he's a 10 million plus type of a guy he's he's a smart

11:52.680 --> 11:57.320
dude he's he's kind of in this space to some extent not in rank and rep but he's

11:57.320 --> 12:03.040
in online marketing and he same thing happened to him he he started off he was

12:03.040 --> 12:07.840
crushing it and doing one thing he was selling one thing and he said he scaled

12:07.840 --> 12:11.840
up to two hundred and fifty thousand dollars per month and then what he did

12:11.840 --> 12:15.840
is he in his head he's like well I'm gonna go add another offer and another

12:15.840 --> 12:21.160
offer and at one point he had 13 different products that he was selling 13

12:21.160 --> 12:25.320
he went from one to 13 and his revenue went from two hundred and fifty

12:25.320 --> 12:29.760
thousand dollars per month to seventy thousand dollars per month and I guess

12:29.760 --> 12:33.400
he joined this guy named Sam Ovens mastermind and Sam Ovens basically told

12:33.400 --> 12:38.560
him he's like get rid of twelve of them keep one or maybe at fourteen and said

12:38.560 --> 12:42.680
he said keep one and he got rid of he got rid of everything except for one

12:42.680 --> 12:46.440
offer and he scaled up to five hundred thousand dollars per month so guys my

12:46.440 --> 12:49.000
number one thing I want to tell you guys is as we're gonna get in we're gonna

12:49.000 --> 12:52.160
talk about a bunch of different niches it's gonna be exciting it's gonna be

12:52.160 --> 12:59.320
fun it's gonna stimulate the brain juices my advice to you is stick with a

12:59.320 --> 13:05.920
couple niches and stick with the boring niches until your bills are paid okay I

13:05.920 --> 13:10.800
would personally recommend until you've gotten one to three deals I would I would

13:10.800 --> 13:16.560
stay air on the side of three do not go into multiple niches stay in pick a

13:16.560 --> 13:21.360
boring niche okay a boring it's a concrete a tree surface a fencing a

13:21.360 --> 13:28.080
spray foam insulation a masonry you guys know all these gutter installation

13:28.080 --> 13:31.520
all these ones that we always talk artificial grass pick one of those go

13:31.520 --> 13:35.880
get your first one two and three deals that's my number one piece of advice

13:35.880 --> 13:41.880
okay don't go build and I know I know I'm contradicting what you guys are

13:41.880 --> 13:47.480
hearing in other groups other groups are telling you to build ten other groups

13:47.480 --> 13:50.880
are telling you to go build ten different sites in ten different cities

13:50.880 --> 13:54.080
and ten different niches and I'm telling you that's a bunch of malarkey

13:54.080 --> 13:58.880
and and most the time the people that want you to build more websites are the

13:58.880 --> 14:03.040
people that benefit from you building more websites if I sell website building

14:03.040 --> 14:11.240
material aka hosting if I sell a white labeled web web builder if I sell

14:11.240 --> 14:18.080
tracking numbers if I sell images if I sell done-for-you services of course I

14:18.080 --> 14:21.200
want you guys to build more websites but I'm here to tell you guys I think

14:21.200 --> 14:24.880
that's very stupid I don't think you need to build more websites I think you

14:24.880 --> 14:28.120
need to be smart about the websites that you build and instead of having a

14:28.120 --> 14:31.760
shotgun approach I want you to have a sniper approach and I want you to know

14:31.760 --> 14:35.240
that when you build a website you have a client and the clients paying for that

14:35.240 --> 14:38.840
website and you can just knock them out and you know you have one in the bag

14:38.840 --> 14:43.760
before you start building the website so again this comes back to why I said this

14:43.760 --> 14:47.240
at the beginning don't just listen to what I'm saying think about it and I

14:47.280 --> 14:50.040
want you to the person that's telling you to build 10 websites I want you to

14:50.040 --> 14:53.280
ask them how much money they're making in this business not from selling their

14:53.280 --> 14:56.480
program not from selling their done-for-you services or their web

14:56.480 --> 15:00.040
hosting or this and that the rest I want you I want you to ask them how much

15:00.040 --> 15:03.440
they're making from doing the actual business before you take their advice

15:03.440 --> 15:08.240
okay because most these people are like the ones in the California gold rush

15:08.240 --> 15:11.160
that sold the picks and the shovels but they don't they're not actually making

15:11.160 --> 15:17.160
money from mining gold so for me I made my first however many million dollars

15:17.160 --> 15:21.760
mining the actual gold and then I saw an opportunity that people would

15:21.760 --> 15:25.320
actually pay for my knowledge because I changed the way this was done and then I

15:25.320 --> 15:30.120
started selling the picks the shovels aka the program so that said guys number

15:30.120 --> 15:34.760
one stick to boring until your bills are paid if your bills are ten thousand

15:34.760 --> 15:38.360
dollars a month go and make sure you're making ten thousand dollars net before

15:38.360 --> 15:44.960
you even think about going into funny niches or you know what you call

15:44.960 --> 15:52.240
obscure niches that's number one okay number two I don't think well this is my

15:52.240 --> 15:58.480
opinion is when in 2020 when I decided and my goal in 2020 is I was like all

15:58.480 --> 16:03.680
right I'm gonna become very focused I'm gonna go into one niche and that was

16:03.680 --> 16:07.560
tree service right that was the only niche I the only niche I dealt with in

16:07.560 --> 16:12.240
2020 in 2020 was tree service now because I had been in these other

16:12.240 --> 16:15.480
programs and I'd build all these these websites that didn't make me money but

16:15.480 --> 16:20.800
that were whatever I had a handful of niches a handful of websites in other

16:20.800 --> 16:25.880
niches so I had a concrete site I had a this side I had a that side I had a

16:25.880 --> 16:30.040
towing site but that's because they were already ranking they were already

16:30.040 --> 16:34.320
getting leads and I was like I'm gonna sell those but I'm gonna focus on tree

16:34.320 --> 16:39.600
service so overwhelmingly most of my I would say 90% of the deals that I did

16:39.600 --> 16:44.200
inside of the year 2020 were in tree service and if it wasn't inside tree

16:44.200 --> 16:49.200
service it was because I already had a website ranking and generating leads

16:49.200 --> 16:53.480
that I built three years before two years before that I probably wouldn't

16:53.480 --> 16:57.000
have even done but I'd been working on it for so long that it was getting leads

16:57.000 --> 17:03.240
so guys if you're new to this pick a niche pick a freaking niche and stick to

17:03.240 --> 17:08.080
it now for those of you that are like oh my gosh concrete saturated yeah you're

17:08.080 --> 17:10.960
gonna start seeing more lead generators than you were two years ago because

17:10.960 --> 17:14.560
we've been talking about concrete for years but you know what's funny is if

17:14.560 --> 17:18.640
you guys aren't following me on YouTube or subscribe to me on YouTube you don't

17:18.640 --> 17:22.280
have to but if you want to we also put out different content and I have this

17:22.280 --> 17:28.320
new series it's gonna be an 8 to 10 part series and I'm literally going me and

17:28.320 --> 17:35.160
Francesca she is going from A to Z on closing a new deal okay A to Z from idea

17:35.160 --> 17:39.240
to deal in the bag to credit card collected and we're gonna do this eight

17:39.240 --> 17:43.800
parts we did part one in fact Aaron or Jason one of you guys go on to YouTube

17:43.800 --> 17:49.080
please get that first video part one and share it in the chat we did part one and

17:49.080 --> 17:52.000
the reason I'm bringing this up is because the guess what niche we're gonna

17:52.000 --> 17:57.760
use freaking concrete concrete and she came to me with this niche and she's

17:57.760 --> 18:03.440
like hey I have this city in this niche in concrete now and I literally Aaron

18:03.440 --> 18:08.960
can testify to this I was like no no there's no way there's no way that this

18:08.960 --> 18:12.520
is that because if you guys once you guys find out the city you're gonna be

18:12.520 --> 18:16.480
like there's no way that's that's that's available there's no way because it's a

18:16.480 --> 18:21.320
well-known city sure enough looked at the CPC it's less than three dollars or

18:21.320 --> 18:26.720
something crazy like that the search volumes over 120 she did the research on

18:26.720 --> 18:30.840
the competition it's low yes there's a couple lead generators in there but

18:30.840 --> 18:35.680
nothing that's that's scaring us off so I want you guys to know that number one

18:35.680 --> 18:40.480
again and there's a reason I'm sticking on this point you guys should not be

18:40.480 --> 18:46.240
going into weird stuff until you guys are paying your bills okay so your first

18:46.240 --> 18:51.480
one to three stick and do one boring niche after you get one to three deals I

18:51.480 --> 18:56.840
think you could you could probably go to like two or three total niches but I

18:56.840 --> 19:01.960
would still stick to boring or tried-and-true niches until your bills

19:01.960 --> 19:05.680
are paid okay and then what you're probably gonna find out this will

19:05.680 --> 19:11.160
happen with me is once you have you know $10,000 a month coming in with tree

19:11.160 --> 19:16.640
service concrete spray foam you're gonna go why would I why would I change what's

19:16.640 --> 19:19.360
working you know that saying if it ain't broke don't fix it that's kind of what

19:19.360 --> 19:22.720
it was for me I was like dude I already know this niche I already know what the

19:22.720 --> 19:27.760
good search terms are I already know that the big companies in this you know

19:27.760 --> 19:32.640
in this space I already know the gossip guys there is gossip on the interwebs

19:32.640 --> 19:36.080
inside of these different niches and I was so familiar with some of these

19:36.080 --> 19:40.400
niches I could call a business owner up and I could I could drop I knew what the

19:40.400 --> 19:45.280
conferences were I knew what the you know obviously the keywords were I knew

19:45.280 --> 19:49.200
where all the money was made I knew who just came into the market I knew the big

19:49.200 --> 19:52.200
marketing companies that were calling all of these guys trying to get their

19:52.200 --> 19:56.280
business I knew all these details and it allowed me to become the expert in

19:56.280 --> 20:01.760
these spaces so again stick to boring until your bills are paid so secondly

20:01.760 --> 20:06.640
okay and then we're gonna get into the different ideas secondly guys is I don't

20:06.640 --> 20:12.480
think until you get to about I would say minimum thirty thousand per month up to

20:12.480 --> 20:17.400
fifty thousand dollars per month I don't think you should be paying out of your

20:17.400 --> 20:23.160
own pocket to test new niches I don't think you should be paying out of your

20:23.160 --> 20:28.120
own pocket to test new niches until you get to thirty to fifty thousand plus per

20:28.120 --> 20:32.800
month what I mean by that guys is what I would recommend and I'm saying this

20:32.800 --> 20:36.600
stuff up front because I don't want you guys to get off this call and start

20:36.600 --> 20:40.040
going into weird niches and blowing a bunch of money on ads and blowing a

20:40.040 --> 20:43.800
bunch of money building websites in niches you shouldn't be a part of but I

20:43.800 --> 20:47.600
don't think that you should be spending your own money to test out niches the

20:47.600 --> 20:50.640
reason being is once you start to get into business once you've been doing

20:50.640 --> 20:56.880
this a long time once you crush it for one to five clients you do a really good

20:56.880 --> 21:00.840
job they're making money you're happy they're happy what's gonna happen is

21:00.840 --> 21:04.800
you're gonna have business owners are gonna come to you with ideas they're

21:04.800 --> 21:07.840
gonna come to you with niches they're gonna come to you with their partners

21:07.840 --> 21:10.640
they're gonna come to you with their family members and their referrals and

21:10.640 --> 21:14.560
they're gonna say hey I know you're crushing it for me in concrete but my

21:14.560 --> 21:22.400
brother-in-law he's got this he's got an XYZ business in the same city and I was

21:22.400 --> 21:26.960
wondering if you could help him out as well and guess what now that person's

21:26.960 --> 21:32.160
coming to you you being the expert you have leverage because they're coming to

21:32.160 --> 21:36.400
you you're not going to them and now you get to use their money to test out this

21:36.400 --> 21:40.160
new niche you're gonna make money and you're gonna get an education at the

21:40.160 --> 21:43.640
same time and if you just stick to the boring niches and you just focus on

21:43.640 --> 21:47.640
getting to where your bills are paid and scaling up to 30 50 thousand dollars per

21:47.640 --> 21:50.880
month I promise you if you're doing a good job you're gonna get a ton of

21:50.880 --> 21:53.480
people that are gonna reach out to you whether it's current business owners

21:53.480 --> 22:00.080
with you know complementary businesses other businesses partners friends

22:00.080 --> 22:03.800
whatever this is going to happen I've had this happen so many times so I'll

22:03.800 --> 22:07.200
give you an example and I've shared this before but I had a guy that we were

22:07.200 --> 22:14.520
selling fencing leads to in Arizona okay and this deal that we had currently

22:14.520 --> 22:17.760
it was it was at least $1,000 a month he might have been paying us $1,200 I can't

22:17.760 --> 22:22.160
remember but we had this deal and we had a goal that month to get you know an

22:22.160 --> 22:27.000
extra $10,000 per month in monthly recurring revenue and I said it with my

22:27.000 --> 22:30.120
team and I said hey if we do this here's gonna be the bonuses so we're gonna go

22:30.120 --> 22:33.760
do this as a team whatever and I remember we were getting near the end of

22:33.760 --> 22:39.480
the month like our 30 days and I was golfing which is always where greatest

22:39.480 --> 22:42.480
the greatest things happen by the way I played twice last week it was amazing

22:42.480 --> 22:46.240
and every single time by the way golfing when you're golfing and you make money

22:46.240 --> 22:51.320
on Stripe it just it just hits differently by the way Jason already

22:51.320 --> 22:54.200
started golfing so I wanted to mention it once you guys get that stripe

22:54.200 --> 22:57.840
notification and you're like dude I just made $250 while I was golfing

22:57.840 --> 23:01.840
something about that's just amazing anyway I was golfing and I remember the

23:02.840 --> 23:06.880
whole I remember everything about it it was like my second or third shot and I

23:06.880 --> 23:14.400
get a call from my sales guy 2020 midsummer sorry late spring and he's

23:14.400 --> 23:18.480
like hey I'm like what's up dude I'm golfing he's like yeah I know and he's

23:18.480 --> 23:22.400
like I have this deal but I'm not sure you're gonna want it I'm like tell me

23:22.400 --> 23:27.560
talk to me and he's like so we have you know X you know so and so I'm like yeah

23:27.560 --> 23:32.480
he's like well I called him I asked him about this other area doing fencing he

23:32.480 --> 23:38.600
doesn't really cover it however he has another business I was like go on tell

23:38.600 --> 23:43.760
me he's like he does cactus removal and immediately I was like all right broke

23:43.760 --> 23:49.320
I'm busy it's a waste of time he's like dude I think it might work and he's in

23:49.320 --> 23:54.960
if you're willing to take a risk he's in and so literally I was like dude and it

23:55.000 --> 23:58.680
was my guy's name was Lincoln by the way he's inside of my program right now

23:58.680 --> 24:04.880
Lincoln hunt super good dude and anyway I said Lincoln here's what you're gonna

24:04.880 --> 24:07.920
do you're gonna quote him high you're gonna quote him at like 1200 bucks a

24:07.920 --> 24:10.800
month I'm like make sure the CPC is good make sure there's no company he's like I

24:10.800 --> 24:14.640
already did I'm like okay let him know that we don't know what's gonna happen

24:14.640 --> 24:19.320
however we'll take his money and I said just do a three-month contract because

24:19.320 --> 24:23.560
that sounds like that's not gonna work but let's let's try it and so he calls

24:23.560 --> 24:29.080
back like okay I got the deal I checked my my my contracts in my email sure

24:29.080 --> 24:33.800
enough you got the deal and dude we tried this niche on his money we told

24:33.800 --> 24:37.040
him we said look man we don't know how this is gonna work you're the first

24:37.040 --> 24:41.140
person we've ever even heard of I didn't even know cactus removal was a freaking

24:41.140 --> 24:46.600
niche you know and I didn't know people paid for the stuff and I basically said

24:46.600 --> 24:50.040
it's on you it's your risk we're gonna do the exact same thing we did with

24:50.040 --> 24:56.040
masonry or sorry with fencing but like we don't know exactly what's gonna

24:56.040 --> 25:00.720
happen but if you want to try it be our guest we quoted him high and he already

25:00.720 --> 25:06.640
trusted us so he's like yeah let's do it and so dude that that was one of the

25:06.640 --> 25:09.960
best freaking webs I don't even know if we still have that that specific client

25:09.960 --> 25:12.960
I know for at least two years we made money and the reason I don't know is

25:12.960 --> 25:16.960
because I don't I don't run the day-to-day inside of my agency we still

25:16.960 --> 25:22.640
do deals we got a deal last not last Monday it was a week ago from Friday

25:22.640 --> 25:27.940
we've got a $1,700 a month artificial grass deal we also got another tiny baby

25:27.940 --> 25:32.000
deal of $300 a month we got we added $2,000 a month in revenue in the last

25:32.000 --> 25:37.800
ten days or not ten days eight six business days and Francesca did all of

25:37.800 --> 25:41.120
it so I don't know if we still have that client I'll find out all I want to know

25:41.120 --> 25:45.760
all I want to tell you guys about we made over $20,000 doing cactus removal do

25:45.760 --> 25:51.720
not go and use your own money to test out niches focus on boring focus on

25:51.720 --> 25:57.200
tried-and-true build out your freaking portfolio get up to your your ten

25:57.200 --> 26:00.920
thousand fifteen thousand thirty thousand fifty thousand and then use

26:00.920 --> 26:05.040
other people's money to test niches and then once you get to those kind of

26:05.040 --> 26:09.400
numbers you can start testing stuff out okay alright guys that said let's talk

26:09.400 --> 26:13.900
about different ideas for the next five seven minutes then we'll get into let's

26:13.940 --> 26:17.380
get into some Q&A break down some niches that kind of stuff again if you're on

26:17.380 --> 26:20.740
this call right now and you stay till the end which is only 20 more minutes

26:20.740 --> 26:23.180
we're gonna take a screenshot if your cameras on we're gonna send you our

26:23.180 --> 26:28.540
digital resource and with all the ideas and all the notes from this this call so

26:28.540 --> 26:34.300
a couple ideas guys and I tried to put these in you know somewhat in order of

26:34.300 --> 26:40.020
the way they came to my mind but also just know that you know you need to

26:40.020 --> 26:43.980
remember that the most important thing is a hungry business owner okay so you

26:43.980 --> 26:49.420
want to think what I'm giving you these ideas think about you know how is that

26:49.420 --> 26:53.060
this person a hungry business owner well I don't know well the fact that they're

26:53.060 --> 26:57.660
doing this thing does that make them hungry or do we not know that should be

26:57.660 --> 27:00.220
the lens that you look at all these different ideas and you should prioritize

27:00.220 --> 27:05.380
the the the hungry business owner is the number one thing okay and I'll give you

27:05.380 --> 27:10.380
some examples as we're going so first one I'm gonna just toss out is mailers

27:10.380 --> 27:19.340
okay guys if you guys get mail which I still do and I used to get so annoyed I

27:19.340 --> 27:23.180
used to get so freaking annoyed at these and I was like dude what are they doing

27:23.180 --> 27:28.140
there's there's these little cards there's you guys know those books I

27:28.140 --> 27:30.780
should have brought my book up here but you know those there's always like the

27:30.780 --> 27:34.580
local coupon book I don't know where mine's at there's always that local

27:34.580 --> 27:38.900
coupon book in your city right sometimes they're paid books those are

27:38.900 --> 27:43.500
even better which there's a guy one of my buddies names Tony here in my city

27:43.500 --> 27:48.580
he has this book called Dixie Direct and literally his entire business guys he

27:48.580 --> 27:53.100
goes to local business owners they pay him to put their ad in this book they

27:53.100 --> 27:56.780
pay him like a couple thousand bucks a year to put their ad in this book and

27:56.780 --> 28:02.020
basically they give a free offer so think about it they're paying him to put

28:02.020 --> 28:08.660
their company name their flyer their ad in his book and on top of that they're

28:08.660 --> 28:13.140
giving away a freebie that's how bad they want business guys mailers are so

28:13.140 --> 28:18.700
good somebody went through the hassle of putting this together designing it going

28:18.700 --> 28:23.340
and getting this you know they're paying who knows what this is a hungry business

28:23.340 --> 28:27.940
owner right they're looking for more business this is a hungry business owner

28:27.940 --> 28:33.620
so anytime I get these before you just throw them away I have stacks of these

28:33.620 --> 28:38.320
things guys and I did this on a call a couple weeks ago but like dude as soon

28:38.320 --> 28:41.860
as my duct cleaning client decides that he's done with me which he's been with

28:41.860 --> 28:46.380
me since 2020 so I don't think he's going anywhere this guy right here duct

28:46.380 --> 28:50.380
pros it's my guy I'm calling this guy he's spending money on on air ducts and

28:50.380 --> 28:55.300
he's given 15% off and duct cleaning already is not that high much of a high

28:55.300 --> 29:01.540
ticket item so these type of things look you know landscaping concrete

29:01.540 --> 29:06.980
coatings like keep these I have stacks of these things laying around my my

29:06.980 --> 29:11.900
office see if I've got any more in here these are great let me see if I have I

29:11.900 --> 29:14.740
always keep these things I've got to have some more here somewhere hold on I

29:14.740 --> 29:21.140
always just throw these in my desk I know at my other place oh here we go I

29:21.180 --> 29:25.940
knew I had more um here we go

29:26.740 --> 29:34.140
there's another one this is a Kerman concrete and landscape we got another

29:34.140 --> 29:40.940
that's their whole flyer net this is another interesting niche tile removal

29:40.940 --> 29:47.500
and demolition okay guys I told you look at this look at this

29:47.620 --> 29:58.780
duct cleaning ah patio covers maybe be one or two more there's a reason I okay

29:58.780 --> 30:01.980
here we go another patio covers

30:05.260 --> 30:13.260
window coverings last one there's a reason I probably kept this one pavers

30:13.300 --> 30:20.460
look at that flyer dude we love pavers that's a big old flyer full page okay

30:20.460 --> 30:25.140
this is a great place to start if you guys see these in the mail keep them if

30:25.140 --> 30:28.620
you're looking for niche ideas keep them these are hungry business owners okay

30:28.620 --> 30:33.940
that's idea number one number two people that knock on your door you know like

30:33.940 --> 30:36.700
somebody knocks on your door and everyone gets weird about it and you

30:36.700 --> 30:40.140
want to drive them off the porch and you want to tell them to get lost and get a

30:40.180 --> 30:43.260
real job well I used to be a door knocker so quit being mean to those

30:43.260 --> 30:47.060
people okay number one but I have a soft spot in my heart for door knockers

30:47.060 --> 30:52.780
because I used to knock doors I spent four years paying for my kids school and

30:52.780 --> 30:58.020
food and housing and our entire lifestyle was was based on me knocking

30:58.020 --> 31:03.020
doors so anytime somebody knocks on my door basically I bought like literally I

31:03.020 --> 31:05.220
don't know the last time you knock somebody knocked on my door I didn't buy

31:05.220 --> 31:11.060
and my kids get weird like everyone gets weird about door knockers these are

31:11.060 --> 31:14.780
humans guys they're freaking humans they're they're way more scared than you

31:14.780 --> 31:20.380
are go talk to them if they're knocking on your door then if it's their company

31:20.380 --> 31:24.220
they're super hungry if it's the company they're representing the company they're

31:24.220 --> 31:27.220
representing is also hungry because they're paying to have a door-to-door

31:27.220 --> 31:31.540
canvassing program if somebody knocks on your door go talk to them get their

31:31.540 --> 31:35.500
business card like have a conversation that doesn't mean you have to use their

31:35.500 --> 31:38.860
service but you know what I like to do is if it's something that's interesting

31:38.860 --> 31:42.580
that I think could be a good niche I'll say hey come back give me a quote and

31:42.580 --> 31:47.820
while they're giving me a quote dude I'm pitching these people on on on working

31:47.820 --> 31:53.440
with me there was a guy that knocked on my door and he did was it landscape

31:53.440 --> 31:57.100
maintenance not a niche that I would ever do again but he knocked on my door

31:57.100 --> 32:01.680
he's like yeah here's the deal and he was a very like he was like a good clean

32:01.680 --> 32:07.060
cut kid I took his number and I only had this tiny little front yard at the time

32:07.060 --> 32:10.660
I didn't finish my backyard but I texted him I said hey dude just wanted to run

32:10.660 --> 32:14.580
an idea past you and I pitched him over text I was like I do actually do lead

32:14.580 --> 32:18.520
generation blah blah blah would you be interested in talking and I actually got

32:18.520 --> 32:22.740
him as a client I actually got this guy's it wasn't a huge client but I got

32:22.740 --> 32:26.140
this guy as a client and he knocked on my door so when they knock on your door

32:26.140 --> 32:29.540
know that they're hungry either it's their company or the company that sent

32:29.540 --> 32:33.460
them they are hungry for business they are literally sending people door to

32:33.460 --> 32:36.980
door to get your business quit being scared of people knocking on your door know

32:36.980 --> 32:40.580
that that indicates it's a hungry business owner get their card these guys

32:40.580 --> 32:44.980
will they would love to come and give you an estimate and when they do guess

32:44.980 --> 32:48.780
what they're gonna listen to what you have to say let them come give you an

32:48.780 --> 32:53.700
estimate on freaking doing you know a mobile car wash I know that I spend

32:53.700 --> 32:57.300
every time my guy comes and he comes every single week or every other week I

32:57.300 --> 33:00.980
spend between eighty eighty five dollars and a hundred and thirty or hundred and

33:00.980 --> 33:05.060
fifty dollars every single week times that by four times up by two I'll send a

33:05.060 --> 33:09.120
three hundred to six hundred dollars per month every single month on mobile car

33:09.120 --> 33:14.700
detail okay let them give you quotes let them come now I'm not saying pest

33:14.700 --> 33:19.540
controls the greatest niche I'm not in it but like dude let them you know if

33:19.540 --> 33:23.300
something like that let them give you a freaking quote quit being weird about

33:23.300 --> 33:25.940
people knocking on your door check that if you're worried make sure they have a

33:25.940 --> 33:30.700
license they're not canvassing your house that's a great option I promise you

33:30.700 --> 33:33.340
some of you guys are in neighborhoods and in cities that you get knocked your

33:33.340 --> 33:36.820
door gets knocked on every single day and you're just being weird about it and

33:36.820 --> 33:40.340
it's literally money knocking on your door okay they are gonna listen to you

33:40.340 --> 33:44.740
they're motivated they're gonna be kind polite and if it's their company there's

33:44.740 --> 33:49.060
a good chance that you're gonna get that deal okay so mailers people who knock on

33:49.060 --> 33:55.220
your door some more obvious ones look in the free group look at what other

33:55.220 --> 33:59.140
people are talking about if you guys aren't using the free group and scanning

33:59.140 --> 34:04.180
through there and just getting updated on you know what was posted today guys

34:04.180 --> 34:08.780
we have 6,000 members of that group 6,000 people trying to make this business

34:08.780 --> 34:12.140
model work and guess what there are people they're making a lot of money pay

34:12.140 --> 34:15.500
attention to what they're saying get ideas now I wouldn't listen to anyone

34:15.620 --> 34:20.000
unless I you know if I see an idea an interesting niche I'm probably gonna DM

34:20.000 --> 34:23.860
that person I'm probably gonna you know go and say hey does this person know

34:23.860 --> 34:27.100
what they're talking about I might even search their name in that group and see

34:27.100 --> 34:30.100
how long they've been in the group and if they post the deals and go okay this

34:30.100 --> 34:33.580
person's making money maybe I should listen but guys look in the free group

34:33.580 --> 34:40.100
look type in the word niche has anyone tried this niche type in just you know

34:40.100 --> 34:45.380
smart words smart phrases inside of the search bar and look at what other people

34:45.380 --> 34:48.660
are talking about do it inside of the art of digital real estate my group do

34:48.660 --> 34:54.220
it inside of rank and rent domination which by the way is also a good group

34:54.220 --> 35:00.540
Ryan Dalton has that group you guys can check that group it's some of you guys

35:00.540 --> 35:04.300
that are inside of digital landlords if I don't know if there's anyone in here

35:04.300 --> 35:08.420
besides Jason Aaron I didn't really pay attention but guys these are great

35:08.420 --> 35:13.340
resources like look again we're just thinking of ideas right free group is a

35:13.340 --> 35:19.500
great place to get ideas next this is one of the ones I really really like is

35:19.500 --> 35:23.940
Facebook community groups local community local Facebook community

35:23.940 --> 35:30.380
group so for example here in st. George I think I'm gonna tell you what my my

35:30.380 --> 35:35.620
groups called I seem to always pull deals from hold on one sec so what you

35:35.620 --> 35:40.860
could do is type in your city so type in st. George or Vegas or whatever and then

35:40.860 --> 35:46.140
click on groups and look at the different groups so right here st. George

35:46.140 --> 35:53.340
word of mouth st. George word of mouth 52,000 members that is literally a group

35:53.340 --> 35:56.860
I'm gonna click on it and tell you the details here welcome to st. George word

35:56.860 --> 36:00.020
of mouth the point of this group is to be a place where residents can come ask

36:00.020 --> 36:05.180
or recommend businesses in the area okay now some of these groups are a bit

36:05.180 --> 36:09.060
spammy yes but let me tell you some of the ones I'm a part of I'm not even in

36:09.100 --> 36:12.340
that group there's so many groups in here I should be I should be hitting these

36:12.340 --> 36:14.740
group I'm gonna tell Francesca hit these groups because I'm not even in them

36:14.740 --> 36:18.860
right now but type that in look at them and then guys what you're gonna notice

36:18.860 --> 36:21.900
I know I'm in some of these groups I want to find one that I'm a part of hold

36:21.900 --> 36:28.260
on let me go to my groups um guys in these group people are going to ask for

36:28.260 --> 36:33.980
recommendations hold on one sec let me go ahead and go to groups I've joined let

36:33.980 --> 36:42.340
me find an example okay um st. George that's a yard cell group not my favorite

36:42.340 --> 36:48.020
type of group let me see if I'm in another st. George group let me see if I

36:48.020 --> 36:53.500
could search about the groups I'm in okay no that one never let me in let's

36:53.500 --> 36:57.540
look at st. George classified okay st. George classified then I'm gonna go to

36:57.540 --> 37:01.700
the search bar I'm gonna type in recommend okay typed in the word

37:01.700 --> 37:08.860
recommend and I'm gonna see if anything pops up hold on this is kind of a weird

37:08.860 --> 37:12.940
group it's more like just straight anyway we could scroll through let me

37:12.940 --> 37:17.180
see if I can see anything I'll pop my head and then if not I won't waste any

37:17.180 --> 37:21.100
time well guys you could scroll these groups you can look for you know people

37:21.100 --> 37:23.780
that are recommending that group that I just mentioned though that sounds like

37:23.780 --> 37:26.500
that the perfect group to be a part of I'm gonna actually request access right

37:26.500 --> 37:34.660
now so again go to groups type in your city st. George Vegas whatever st. George

37:34.660 --> 37:38.140
word-of-mouth I'm gonna push join it's probably gonna ask me questions there we

37:38.140 --> 37:43.100
go blah blah I'll do that after okay that's a great place to come up with

37:43.100 --> 37:48.860
ideas okay so another thing even not inside of groups is you can go to

37:48.860 --> 37:53.300
Facebook and just search the actual regular search bar and type in you know

37:53.300 --> 37:59.380
smart words so type in recommend and type in the city so I typed in recommend

37:59.380 --> 38:04.620
st. George okay beautiful great example I typed in recommend st. George now this

38:04.620 --> 38:12.020
is old but we could filter this I believe by by date but I'm just gonna

38:12.020 --> 38:15.340
give you a couple ideas so like right here looking to put a pool in our

38:15.340 --> 38:22.180
backyard who do you guys recommend okay and I actually like that post so I must

38:22.220 --> 38:26.260
have reached out okay so that's somebody that is a lead guys I could literally

38:26.260 --> 38:30.220
listen to this I could literally reach out to that person especially because

38:30.220 --> 38:35.860
look with that person I have ten mutual friends I can reach out to that person I

38:35.860 --> 38:39.380
could say hey I have this I have a recommendation for you you may or may

38:39.380 --> 38:42.100
not know me it looks like we have ten mutual friends can I recommend somebody

38:42.100 --> 38:46.460
for you guess what that is now a lead I didn't even have to pay for Google Ads

38:46.460 --> 38:50.300
and I have a lead that I can use to go and find a business owner now pool

38:50.300 --> 38:54.620
installation not loving that niche right now because of the recession it's

38:54.620 --> 38:59.020
kind of dipped off but I've made some money in that in that niche okay let's

38:59.020 --> 39:02.860
see what else we got need an AC guy who do you guys recommend that's amazing

39:02.860 --> 39:08.580
don't love the niche but it's an idea right can anyone recommend a good bug

39:08.580 --> 39:16.460

39:21.180 --> 39:26.820
to the comments and check this out I get all these different businesses right so

39:26.820 --> 39:32.380
guys again we're just talking about generating niche ideas but this also

39:32.380 --> 39:37.180
gives me an idea of who's good in town Bryce kid new edition concrete I've

39:37.180 --> 39:41.180

McDonald trademark concrete Latson concrete Austin McDonald dude there is

39:53.980 --> 39:59.300
literally this is one of the best it's it's unbelievable you could go here and

39:59.300 --> 40:04.780
just scroll let's see what else we got let me give you one or two more ideas

40:04.780 --> 40:09.820
guys looking for an architect that does home remodels that seems a little too

40:09.820 --> 40:14.620
niche I'm not sure that I would do that one uh what else we got for

40:14.620 --> 40:24.300
recommendations what else what else that's hair I'm not gonna be doing hair

40:24.300 --> 40:31.180
plumbing says I need a plumber what else lucky looking for the best realtor

40:31.180 --> 40:36.340
lender team that's not a niche that I like dentist again not all these are

40:36.340 --> 40:41.100
going to be the ones you want but this is just a great place to start looking

40:41.100 --> 40:46.420
for a videographer for an event this was July 31st less than a month ago okay

40:46.420 --> 40:50.660
anyway just giving you guys ideas that's a great place to come up with niche

40:50.660 --> 40:53.460
ideas okay let's keep going through these really quick so I can get one or

40:53.460 --> 40:58.700
two questions another great place to come up with ideas is services that you

40:58.700 --> 41:02.580
need done around your house services that you need done around your house you

41:02.580 --> 41:07.220
need your carpets cleaned you need your house clean you need your pool clean you

41:07.220 --> 41:12.780
need new concrete I just barely bought a new car about eight months ago nine

41:12.780 --> 41:20.940
months ago and it's a very low car and so my my curb it almost scrapes my Tesla

41:20.940 --> 41:24.340
and so I was like dude it's gonna scrape the crap out of this new car so I had to

41:24.340 --> 41:28.420
go and I had to cut the concrete almost down to you know make it so it was

41:28.420 --> 41:32.500
almost flush with the the ground that's it I'd never even thought out this

41:32.500 --> 41:36.940
niche concrete cutting it's not concrete flat work it's not concrete decorative

41:36.940 --> 41:42.620
concrete concrete cutting so it was something I needed done so now that's

41:42.620 --> 41:45.580
you know that's an idea I never even thought about that right what else do

41:45.580 --> 41:48.980
you need done at your house pressure washing I was just barely thinking about

41:48.980 --> 41:52.660
how dirty my house like I'm gonna use that's that could be do I like the niche

41:52.660 --> 41:57.220
no but if I did I could use that what else do I need obviously mobile car

41:57.260 --> 42:00.900
detailing epoxy garage floor if you're looking to do that I just did that on my

42:00.900 --> 42:05.220
townhome that's a great place services that you want or need done at your house

42:05.220 --> 42:08.700
okay I think those are two different things services that you need done at

42:08.700 --> 42:13.300
your house those are a little bit better I need my tree removed services that you

42:13.300 --> 42:18.100
want done at your house I want my garage epoxy right the one that you need done

42:18.100 --> 42:20.780
that's probably a little bit better because there's probably other people

42:20.780 --> 42:25.300
that need it done and services that you want are still good but they're probably

42:25.340 --> 42:29.460
not gonna be as recession proof so those are two different things the services

42:29.460 --> 42:34.540
that you need done and the services that you want done I was looking up the other

42:34.540 --> 42:39.140
day I was in my kitchen and I saw I had a really dirty ducts like I need to get

42:39.140 --> 42:43.140
my ducks clean I need to get my ducks clean that's something I need to get

42:43.140 --> 42:46.420
done I don't want to get it done but I need to get it done okay so services

42:46.420 --> 42:50.620
that you need to get done service that you want call the company call three of

42:50.660 --> 42:56.500
them okay have them come to your house give you an estimate while they're

42:56.500 --> 43:01.260
giving you an estimate pitch them they're gonna listen to what you have to

43:01.260 --> 43:07.460
say they watch your business they watch your business okay here's some more

43:07.460 --> 43:12.060
obvious ones home advisor guys if you go to home advisor you can go I don't even

43:12.060 --> 43:14.860
need to do this but you can go to home advisor you can go to their main website

43:14.860 --> 43:19.660
even though I hate home advisor I'm not gonna click on their ad and you can

43:19.700 --> 43:24.860
literally go and it says start a project and you can just go and browse guys

43:24.860 --> 43:30.420
there's so many ideas dude put painting lawn care landscaping kitchen keating

43:30.420 --> 43:35.420
and cooling garage gutters ceiling insulation there are so many ideas you

43:35.420 --> 43:41.380
could just go and search on home advisor for days another idea Angie's list go and

43:41.380 --> 43:46.460
look guys home advisor angel the one thing I don't like about these is there

43:46.460 --> 43:51.900
so many ideas that you could become overwhelmed and I I generally like the

43:51.900 --> 43:57.340
idea of like I would I would prefer doing like a Facebook recommendation is

43:57.340 --> 44:01.340
more interesting to me because I could use that as a lead and I can it

44:01.340 --> 44:05.260
literally proves to me that there's people looking for that service it kind

44:05.260 --> 44:09.140
of gives me an idea if I see multiple people looking for pools in my area I'm

44:09.140 --> 44:12.540
like okay pools is pretty popular in this area right you know the other good

44:12.540 --> 44:17.340
thing is you don't have to do the Facebook groups in your city I could go

44:17.340 --> 44:25.580
and look at recommendations Las Vegas recommendations whatever let's just think

44:25.580 --> 44:31.580
of another city Glendale Arizona recommendations Queen Creek Arizona

44:31.580 --> 44:35.700
right the reason I like doing your own backyard is because you have mutual

44:35.700 --> 44:40.020
friends you can reach out to so home advisor Angie's list also guys banners

44:40.060 --> 44:44.980
hanging at local sporting events they're paying to be there right they're paying

44:44.980 --> 44:50.420
to have their name hung on the freaking chain link fence and then also I

44:50.420 --> 44:54.220
mentioned car wraps people are paying thousands of dollars I spent like

44:54.220 --> 45:00.140
$3,000 to wrap a smart car I've spent up to $5,000 to wrap these are expensive

45:00.140 --> 45:04.780
wraps they want more business so mailers people who knock on your door free

45:04.780 --> 45:09.020
groups local community and recommendation groups services you need

45:09.020 --> 45:12.060
done at your house services you want done at your house home advisor Angie's

45:12.060 --> 45:17.820
list banners hanging at local sporting events and car wraps those are ten ideas

45:17.820 --> 45:23.020
you could not possibly go and list all the niches if you just looked at three

45:23.020 --> 45:27.340
of those ideas okay so real quick I'm gonna stay on for like three four five

45:27.340 --> 45:30.860
more minutes Aaron or Jason are one of you guys available to go through

45:30.860 --> 45:33.500
questions comments really quick let's try to knock through some of them if one

45:33.500 --> 45:38.340
of you guys are still on who's on right now yeah I don't see Aaron on here so I

45:38.380 --> 45:41.540
can take care of it okay Jason we have any questions comments let's see if we

45:41.540 --> 45:46.300
go we can get through in five minutes and by the way in one minute I'm gonna

45:46.300 --> 45:49.380
have you screenshot because the people that stayed up until the hour I want

45:49.380 --> 45:51.900
them to get the digital resource on anyone that wants to stay on the last

45:51.900 --> 45:54.940
five minutes you're free to do so but you don't have to get the resource so why

45:54.940 --> 45:57.660
don't you go ahead and actually just go ahead and screenshot everybody that's on

45:57.660 --> 46:03.060
right now so we can send them the digital resource by the way Jason

46:03.060 --> 46:07.860
already is on this call he is Donnie Dre inside the free group Jason you're at

46:07.860 --> 46:15.500
13 or $14,000 per month well okay oh sorry sorry I just went into the

46:15.500 --> 46:24.180
snapshot mode so one thing that happens are you at 13 or 14 thousand I was just

46:24.180 --> 46:29.180
trying to make sure people knew so I actually lost a deal that was $800 per

46:29.180 --> 46:34.380
month so I went back a little bit had a small setback now you're at 13 or you're

46:35.300 --> 46:42.300
I was at 13 8 just probably went back to 13 this guy literally gave him 14 leads

46:42.300 --> 46:48.100
in two weeks and he said they weren't good enough so I look at this as a very

46:48.100 --> 46:52.420
good thing so small setbacks like this are actually really good things for your

46:52.420 --> 46:56.580
business because it allows you to find somebody who's more hungry and will take

46:56.580 --> 47:03.460
advantage of receiving 14 weeds in two weeks so $13,000 per month right now

47:03.460 --> 47:06.460
beautiful okay so I'm just saying I'm just mentioning that so people know

47:06.460 --> 47:09.620
that you're you're legit you're not just some whatever so Jason let's go to the

47:09.620 --> 47:18.100
comments but yeah you're good bro yeah okay sorry had to take that screenshot

47:18.100 --> 47:26.060
real quick um so we have uh Amy D. Hoog she's just referring to some niches

47:26.060 --> 47:32.780
refrigeration for dairy wineries or distilleries so she's just bringing up

47:33.100 --> 47:40.100
so is this for me to like give my thoughts yeah um I first and foremost

47:40.100 --> 47:44.820
guys let me remind everyone that every niche you can generate leads for no

47:44.820 --> 47:48.220
matter what it is I promise you I've done some really competitive what you

47:48.220 --> 47:52.380
can generate leads for everything everything doing this model but it's

47:52.380 --> 47:58.580
it's varying scales of success so I think about how many boxes does it check

47:58.580 --> 48:02.420
is it is it phone driven if it checks that I go to the next one is it is it

48:02.420 --> 48:05.900
branded if it checks that do I go to the next one or is it unbranded sorry is

48:05.900 --> 48:10.460
it a high ticket and you just start going down the list so I'm gonna like

48:10.460 --> 48:13.860
that one for example I don't know anything about that niche but to me that

48:13.860 --> 48:17.700
sounds like something that's like you it's not mobile right that's something

48:17.700 --> 48:24.460
that's like a brick-and-mortar or am I wrong like that fits more into the HVAC

48:24.460 --> 48:29.100
right okay okay I thought it was like something to actually like these okay

48:29.100 --> 48:32.260
so yeah that would that does sound like it was fit I don't know anything about

48:32.260 --> 48:35.460
that Nick tell me what it's called again what she said it called you said

48:35.460 --> 48:41.700
refrigeration for dairy and wineries and distilleries or so large

48:41.700 --> 48:49.180
refrigeration systems I'm yeah industrial refrigeration um yeah I mean

48:49.180 --> 48:56.620
so I don't love HVAC but this sounds like a sub niche of HVAC it's commercial

48:56.620 --> 49:02.300
refrigeration so it looks like this is saying like I don't even know anything

49:02.300 --> 49:07.020
about this but it's yeah this that could be interesting so um cold storage for

49:07.020 --> 49:10.660
breweries if you're talking about the person that actually goes and fixes or

49:10.660 --> 49:14.900
does the repairs and the maintenance on these type of things that could be very

49:14.900 --> 49:18.820
interesting because that is a sub niche of a much more competitive niche I like

49:18.820 --> 49:22.540
that because it's specific the only thing you could get into is because it's

49:22.540 --> 49:26.860
so neat niche I'm not sure that there's gonna be a ton of companies that are

49:26.860 --> 49:30.500
doing it which means that the one person in town that's doing it might be getting

49:30.500 --> 49:34.780
all the business already but I like that you're taking a niche that is very

49:34.780 --> 49:39.460
competitive HVAC and you're sub niching it's like going to plumbing and going to

49:39.460 --> 49:45.420
what's the one that everyone does like sewage or you know what I'm talking

49:45.420 --> 49:50.580
about right where they go and you know I'm talking about Jason not sewage you

49:50.580 --> 49:54.420
talking about the septic tank pumping septic room is it septic tank removal or

49:54.420 --> 49:59.460
whatever septic septic cleaning I don't know that yeah if it's a if it's a

49:59.460 --> 50:02.820
competitive niche make sure you're going to submit so this one I'm not a know but

50:02.820 --> 50:05.220
I just don't know anything about it I have to do more research but that's a

50:05.220 --> 50:08.420
very interesting niche I've never even thought about it but that's very very

50:08.420 --> 50:12.700
niche imagine it basically industrial refrigeration technician or whatever I

50:12.700 --> 50:16.740
don't even know what the term is so I'm not a know on that one I know it's gonna

50:16.740 --> 50:20.420
be high ticket the only thing that sounds a little bit scary for me is that

50:20.420 --> 50:23.660
there might not be a lot of people so if you go into a big enough city and it's

50:23.660 --> 50:32.100
low competition yeah that could be very interesting what else now Martin says so

50:32.100 --> 50:37.740
he's recommending another niche it's water well installation that said that

50:37.740 --> 50:44.660
is again I know that one's gonna be high ticket because my dad's a farmer and I

50:45.140 --> 50:50.780
know how much he spends on doing a water well I don't know how much demand if you

50:50.780 --> 50:54.780
can go into a city where there's demand there's a lot of money in water wells it

50:54.780 --> 50:58.340
costs I don't know if you guys know the work that goes into that they have to

50:58.340 --> 51:02.460
they have to figure out where the water where to drill and then they literally

51:02.460 --> 51:07.900
like I think at my dad's farm they've they have to drill hundreds of feet to

51:07.900 --> 51:13.900
get into these aquifers and it's expensive it's multiple ten thousand

51:13.900 --> 51:20.980
dollars to do it's very expensive so I like it I just as long as there's volume

51:20.980 --> 51:24.700
and then again the only thing I would think that might be a little bit tough

51:24.700 --> 51:29.340
is I'm thinking like my dad he's not going to Google to search for somebody

51:29.340 --> 51:32.380
to put in a water well he's gonna call his other buddy that's a farmer and say

51:32.380 --> 51:38.260
hey Ken who do you use or hey Tony who do you use that's the only thing that

51:38.260 --> 51:42.020
would scare me about that everything else sounds good I've never done it just

51:42.020 --> 51:45.100
full transparency but that's the one thing I don't like it sounds a bit of

51:45.100 --> 51:51.380
like a bit more of a referral type of niche and you want to consider a little

51:51.380 --> 51:56.100
bit of the closing process too if it takes several months for a job to

51:56.100 --> 51:59.620
process and for them to get all the licensing and stuff they need and then

51:59.620 --> 52:04.980
pass code and stuff it's probably not a niche that's ideal because it's gonna

52:04.980 --> 52:08.940
take several months to close the job yeah that would be one of those again

52:08.940 --> 52:13.340
guys once you get into you know paying for your bills and you're good then then

52:13.340 --> 52:16.900
you start tapping in this kind of thing but yeah write it down have a have a

52:16.900 --> 52:19.780
note in your phone of interesting ideas and it's something you could look into

52:20.780 --> 52:27.340
any other ones yeah um let's see so let's do two more we'll call it okay so

52:27.340 --> 52:34.580
Ameya she is so roofing and house painters as two niches that's what

52:34.580 --> 52:38.940
she's recommending I don't even know she's recommending because she might

52:38.940 --> 52:43.540
have also she could be asking I don't like oh sorry yeah asking about that

52:43.540 --> 52:47.100
sorry I don't like either of them roofing if you want to go into roof

52:47.100 --> 52:50.740
repair or you want to go into metal roofing or tile roofing you want to go

52:50.740 --> 52:57.140
to a sub niche niche of roofing okay painting I don't like it nor have I

52:57.140 --> 53:02.620
found anyone that is in love with that that niche either so let me save you

53:02.620 --> 53:09.660
some time last one Martin is recommending or asking about drilling

53:09.660 --> 53:19.940
holes and like core drilling for concrete yes I again I I would look at

53:19.940 --> 53:23.540
search volume I would look at job size like how much does it cost to do

53:23.540 --> 53:26.300
something like that I don't even know what that service is you drill a hole in

53:26.300 --> 53:34.740
the concrete for what do you call so I actually talked to a concrete guy and

53:34.780 --> 53:39.500
because I was like hey dude I can get you leads for concrete and there's a guy

53:39.500 --> 53:46.140
I knew and he he's like oh I only focus on cutting and drilling holes doing core

53:46.140 --> 53:50.300
drilling and I looked at the search volume and there was almost no search

53:50.300 --> 53:54.100
volume for that like yeah it is something people offer but you want to

53:54.100 --> 53:58.100
make sure that you get a good amount of volume for these sub niches also maybe

53:58.100 --> 54:02.860
if you're in a bigger city but I can't make my guy some niches you're gonna

54:02.860 --> 54:05.500
have to go to a bigger city which isn't the worst thing okay I'm looking at the

54:05.500 --> 54:08.660
service right now that would kind of fit in that same category as cutting just

54:08.660 --> 54:13.420
like I had no idea that people I had no idea that anyone I was like I when I got

54:13.420 --> 54:20.260
my sidewalk cut down I had no idea that that was even a service like who would

54:20.260 --> 54:24.180
ever think that you need to call somebody and pay them $5,000 to cut your

54:24.180 --> 54:29.880
sidewalk like for what and then you're like oh I see it now but again I I can

54:29.880 --> 54:33.480
tell you there's not that many people that are getting their driveways cut

54:33.480 --> 54:40.040
down it's it's probably bigger jobs it's probably you know few and far between so

54:40.040 --> 54:45.120
guys with any of these sub niches you're gonna have to go into probably bigger

54:45.120 --> 54:49.560
cities bigger markets because that's typically where you're gonna find more

54:49.560 --> 54:53.760
search volume so the more obscure the niche or the more obscure the niche the

54:53.760 --> 55:00.840
more the bigger the city most likely which isn't bad but again stick to

55:00.840 --> 55:06.520
boring until you get to the 10 20 30 40 $50,000 I wouldn't even think about some

55:06.520 --> 55:10.980
of this stuff until you've gotten to minimum paid your bills let's do one more

55:10.980 --> 55:16.960
do you have any more we do one more okay I think we've kind of covered most of

55:16.960 --> 55:22.040
people asking about the niches but James Curry says that he has a deal in the

55:22.040 --> 55:28.360
concrete coring and cutting so there you go so yeah it's doable that that's good

55:28.360 --> 55:31.360
news that if someone else is doing it and then my next question would be like

55:31.360 --> 55:34.440
how many you do have one deal they have to do how much is that deal do you have

55:34.440 --> 55:39.160
you done it across multiple because I also got a deal for let me give you an

55:39.160 --> 55:46.920
example like I got a deal for stucco okay build a side got a deal but I can

55:46.920 --> 55:50.920
tell you I haven't built another one because it wasn't that good so I would

55:50.920 --> 55:54.560
be interested in James Curry to know and you could maybe post it or people

55:54.560 --> 55:58.360
could reach out to James the Facebook group but yeah there you go there's

55:58.360 --> 56:02.120
money in it it just comes down to how much money and could I use that same

56:02.120 --> 56:08.000
time those same resources in another niche and get way more upside way more

56:08.000 --> 56:16.120
bang for my buck way more juice out of my squeeze or is it worth it make sense

56:16.160 --> 56:22.200
all right that said guys appreciate you guys being on the call what we're going

56:22.200 --> 56:26.520
to do once again if you were on ten minutes ago we screenshot it we're gonna

56:26.520 --> 56:30.840
send you the digital resource Jason we typically have that within 24 hours

56:30.840 --> 56:37.360
roughly right yeah I so I've been kind of bad at going through and sending them

56:37.360 --> 56:41.680
out lately excuse me I'll make sure to get that done though and go through and

56:41.680 --> 56:46.000
send it to everybody who's been here we get so much so many response for the

56:46.000 --> 56:50.520
recording that sometimes I kind of like going back and hitting you guys up but

56:50.520 --> 56:53.800
I'll make sure to get that done beautiful so guys thanks for being on

56:53.800 --> 56:57.440
the call again just a reminder stay in the boring until you hit you tell you

56:57.440 --> 57:04.000
pay your bills and again you don't need I guess I'll end with this I've made my

57:04.000 --> 57:08.920
first seven figures in five or less niches like I had if you looked at all

57:08.920 --> 57:14.160
of my put my my properties and you looked at all the niches I was in I was

57:14.160 --> 57:18.780
in five or less and majority of those were in three you don't need to have 20

57:18.780 --> 57:22.040
different niches you don't need to have something so obscure that you've never

57:22.040 --> 57:26.240
thought of you don't need to have some crazy niche that that you know no one's

57:26.240 --> 57:30.880
ever even considered to make millions of dollars you can make millions of dollars

57:30.880 --> 57:35.000
doing boring tried-and-true basic niches and doing it again and again and again

57:35.000 --> 57:38.920
the money is in the buy not the sale make sure you're spending the time and

57:38.920 --> 57:45.080
going into the cities that going into the cities that are low-hanging in the

57:45.080 --> 57:47.320
sense that they're low hanging fruit in the sense there's not a lot of

57:47.320 --> 57:51.640
competition there's good search volume and you can go in and there's there's an

57:51.640 --> 57:56.040
opportunity for you to go and rank a website and sell those leads to hungry

57:56.040 --> 57:58.960
business owners so guys thanks for being on the call and we'll see you next week

57:58.960 --> 58:03.280
thanks Jason
