1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,940
so now that we have inserted the page title we're going to do the page

2
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:12,540
description right here so just so you know the page description let's say you

3
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:19,380
were looking for Bentonville concrete is this description right here that comes

4
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:25,620
up and I'm sure so see how Angie's list right here it says dot dot dot that's

5
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:28,780
something that we don't want we want everything in the page description to be

6
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:33,500
able to fit and how you do that is just to keep it's just by keeping the page

7
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:38,620
description between 160 and 165 characters and again we're going to use

8
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:43,580

9
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:49,220
giving a short brief simple description of what that page is about so for the

10
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:55,860
home page right here I would probably just and I'm just going to type it in

11
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:01,740
here so I know exactly when I'm hitting that 160 character mark I would say
