Zach, I have a client that wants to go into real estate, but it's too competitive in the city he

00:03.840 --> 00:09.680
wants. Do you ever tell people, no, because it's too competitive? Oh, all the time. What I do there,

00:09.680 --> 00:14.800
Zach, is I say, hey, man, what I'm going to have to charge you to make it worth it, you're probably

00:14.800 --> 00:19.120
not going to want to pay. And they're going to go, how much is that? And I'd quote them at some

00:19.120 --> 00:25.280
astronomical price. And if they end up saying, love us, let's do it, do it, and then go outsource

00:25.280 --> 00:33.520
it, right? Kyle Goldstein has a ton of huge SEO clients. And it's because he charges ridiculous

00:33.520 --> 00:38.960
prices. And they say yes. Okay, so that's what I would do. Because you don't really need the deal.

00:39.520 --> 00:42.240
And it's like real estate, how long are they going to stay, it's going to be paying the

00:42.240 --> 00:46.320
quote on some stupid amount. And then if they say yes, great. If not, you didn't lose anything.
