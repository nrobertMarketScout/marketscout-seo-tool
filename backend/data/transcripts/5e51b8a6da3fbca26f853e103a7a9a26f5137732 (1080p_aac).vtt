Kind of off topic, but how many times will you call back a lead to get info before you

00:03.760 --> 00:06.320
just say F it and move on?

00:06.320 --> 00:07.920
I left two voicemails to a lead.

00:07.920 --> 00:09.360
I call seven times.

00:09.360 --> 00:10.360
Seven is my magic number.

00:10.360 --> 00:14.560
I have my Dylan telling, hey, after seven times, we can go ahead and assume this person

00:14.560 --> 00:15.920
is not going to answer.

00:15.920 --> 00:22.120
But when I call, just so you know, Chris, one call for me is I call, goes to voicemail,

00:22.120 --> 00:25.880
I call again, I shoot a text and I leave a voicemail.

00:25.880 --> 00:26.880
That's one call.

00:26.880 --> 00:27.880
I do that seven times.

00:27.880 --> 00:29.120
If after seven times, I move on.

00:29.120 --> 00:31.080
I mark it as a bad lead.

00:31.080 --> 00:32.080
Seven is the magic number.

00:32.080 --> 00:33.080
I don't even know why.

00:33.080 --> 00:34.080
I just came up with that.

00:34.080 --> 00:35.080
So you could do whatever.

00:35.080 --> 00:35.100
I do seven.
